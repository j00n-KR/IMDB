0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not a patch on the original Jurassic Park, and is an uneven film, but by far the best of the sequels",7,20 September 2015,"The original Jurassic Park still is a personal favourite, it is an enormously fun, thrilling (with some nail-biting moments) and brilliantly made film, with one of John Williams' most memorable main themes and scene-stealing dinosaurs. The Lost World has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and Jurassic Park 3 was even more disappointing.Jurassic World is not a patch on the first Jurassic Park and I didn't quite find it the return to form that it has been touted as, but for all its faults and uneven parts it is a massive improvements on the previous two sequels and is an entertaining film in its own right that does more right than it does wrong.First things off, Jurassic World is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were. This is especially true with the Indominus Rex, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when she is stalking her prey it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for Jurassic Park, which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.The film's homages are most enjoyable and give the film a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good of thrills and scares to be had. The latter half is often very exciting, the film is efficiently directed, doing nicely in maintaining the tension, and the acting is good (though one does wish that the characters were written better). Chris Pratt has a likable and warm presence, as well as a nice wit, and Bryce Dallas Howard is similarly good even with the most problematically written character. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a real effort making his somewhat one-note and underused character more interesting than he deserves to be and does bring some intensity.However, Jurassic World does contain some large problems. Not all the acting works, Judy Greer for my tastes was annoying in places and the children's acting was often too forced and their back story goes nowhere. The script and story are uneven, with the script it has its moments but it can be a bit muddled, as a result of trying to do too much at times, some of the dialogue is very weak and can induce cringes and some of the reversals are really out of place. It also could have done a much better developing the characters, because they felt very underdeveloped and clichéd, especially Claire, and any character arcs come off clumsily or aren't explored enough, particularly for the children. Owen and Claire's romance can slow the film down and does contain some forced dialogue. The story is at least never really dull, and excites more than it limps, but at the same time it does lack the wonder, consistent suspense, smartness and originality that Jurassic Park had. It does feel like a too predictable rehash at times, does feel muddled tonally, the exposition in the first half hour does go on for far too long and doesn't really say anything interesting and the ending is too silly and anti-climactic for my tastes.All in all, uneven and not on the same level as the original Jurassic Park, but a very entertaining well made film and by far the best of the sequels. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",Jurassic World
1,Leofwine_draca,One heck of a mixed bag,6,8 December 2015,"As a huge fan of the original JURASSIC PARK - I was twelve years old when I saw it in 1993, pretty much the perfect age - I was eager to check out this all-new and revamped sequel/update/reboot of the premise. At the same time, I pretty much dismissed memories of the previous two sequels, which were entirely forgettable and sub-par popcorn flicks. The new JURASSIC WORLD is one heck of a mixed bag as a film. It contains many, many flaws and parts I hated, alongside some good moments that I enjoyed. It's very similar to the new TERMINATOR GENISYS in that respect, although an improvement over the Schwarzenegger movie. The good parts of JURASSIC WORLD are invariably those which involve the dinosaurs; when the dinos are on screen, the film is fun; when they're off, it's a failure.The main problem lies in the writing of the human characters. It took four scriptwriters to concoct this mess, and what we get IS nothing more than a mess. There are gender stereotypes and a clichéd romance straight out of a 1970s-era Mills & Boon novel. There are annoying kids throughout, one of whom is mildly creepy, the other a crying little brat. Vincent D'onofrio and Irrfan Khan are the best of the human cast, as their natural charisma comes through, but Bryce Dallas Howard is hopeless, the worst I've ever seen her. Attempts at characterisation and to make her character funny fall flat every time and as for her stilted acting...well, I was cringing. This film has a real problem with the female characters and the kids and even a good actress couldn't have done much with this character, which puts the women's liberation movement back some 50 years.The human plots are poor and sloppily put together. The first half of the film has scale but no sense of the intricacies of running a theme park, then all of that gets forgotten about in the second in favour of a small-scale human drama. Vincent D'Onofrio is likeable but attempts to turn his character into a bad guy (when he clearly isn't) are pitiful. Plus, I hated the way we finally get to see a populated theme park with thousands of visitors, only for them to remain off screen and irrelevant for most of the time, aside from in a 5 minute set-piece, then they're forgotten about.So, that's all the bad stuff. The good news is that the dinosaurs are great and great fun to watch. CGI effects have improved to the point when they look quite nice, particularly the underwater dinosaur. The Indominus rex is a fitting menace, although the real stars of the show are the Velociraptors, who have a sub-plot (i.e. they're tame) which could have been the cheesiest thing ever, but which turns out to be the best thing in the movie. The monster action at the climax of this movie is strong stuff indeed and it makes for far better spectacle than the recent GODZILLA remake. So, there you have JURASSIC WORLD: a mix of the great, the awful, and the generally humdrum, but it provides a fitfully entertaining thrill-ride if you do your best to ignore the pitifully written characters. NB. I also checked out the 3D edition, which adds plenty of immersive depth albeit few 'jump out' shots.",Jurassic World
2,SnoopyStyle,bad comedy but fun dinosaur action,6,19 August 2015,Karen Mitchell sends her sons Gray and Zach to Jurassic World in Isla Nublar which is run by her sister Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is a velociraptor trainer. Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) wants to turn them into military weapons. The park is creating genetic amalgamations. The latest is the most dangerous of them all. Then it escapes and chaos ensues.It's funny that Claire's heels became such a big complaint. The movie obviously knows it's a joke so pointing it out is a little beside the point. The biggest problem is that Claire isn't funny and I don't blame it all on BDH. The character is written badly and so is Owen. Almost every attempt at comedy ends with me groaning at its clumsiness. Claire and Owen have almost no chemistry. I hated them kissing in the middle of pterosaurs attack. It's just ridiculous. It's one of those cliché moves that needs to be outlawed. Stop kissing and shoot some pterosaurs. The movie still works because it has giant dinosaurs and it's a fun adventure.,Jurassic World
3,Hitchcoc,A Bigger Better Killer,6,23 June 2015,"We have reached the point where the incredible special effects are becoming mundane. We've seen these dinosaurs attack humans and other dinosaurs before. The new one, a genetically engineered killing machine that has parts of other dinosaurs, is no more remarkable than its predecessors. I didn't see it doing anything more intellectual than any other dinosaur. Once again, the cheap use of vulnerable children is at the center of things. They have been sent to be with their aunt who is a big shot in the Jurassic Park business. She is self centered and insensitive, even when her orders lead to carnage. Vincent D'Onofrio is the heavy, although there are enough of those to go around. Chris Pratt is the take charge guy who has learned to bond with velociraptors. The kids, of course, pay no attention to orders given, and get themselves into a life or death situation. Now everyone has to try to save them. Of course, there is a huge dose of intensity as things go from bad to worse. The two leads who have virtually no personality begin to bond from a caustic first encounter. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's just the same old stuff. There is nothing new here. The other thing. What about all the people who have been killed or maimed? Do our heroes really care? If you want to consider the real world, imagine the lawsuits and medical claims from gross negligence. Not to mention charges of manslaughter. And our red headed heroine would be hung out to dry. Finally, we do need a better, more creative story other than people being assaulted time after time by creatures fifty times their size and somehow managing to get away.",Jurassic World
4,Prismark10,Back to Amber,6,12 July 2015,"Jurassic Park from 1993 was a landmark film that mixed state of the art CGI into a rip roaring disaster film based on the novel by Michael Crichton where the author ripped off his earlier film, Westworld and director Steven Spielberg added some liberal helping from his monster smash, Jaws.The sequels were lukewarm, even Spielberg who directed Jurassic Park 2 struggled to deliver a worthy follow up adventure. Universal Pictures plans for a fourth instalment was on hold for many years until Jurassic World was released to record breaking box office.Here we have billionaire Industrialist Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan) running Jurassic World along the lines of John Hammond's legacy. To bring back dinosaurs to life in a safe environment and visitors to enjoy themselves. However to keep visitor numbers up the park needs to innovate bigger, newer and cooler creatures.Dr Wu (B D Wong who presumably did not get eaten in the first Jurassic Park) returns as a more sinister scientist who has mixed and cooked up new DNA to create Indominus Rex, a dinosaur who is big, cunning and has some kind of superpowers. I can only think that Dr Wu got hold of some Predator DNA from a passing Arnold Schwarzenegger. How the creature escapes from her pen is reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs in the way she fooled her keepers.Bryce Dallas Howard is workaholic executive Claire making sure the park runs efficiently and at a profit. She does not even have time to spare for her two nephews who are visiting the park and staying over with her for a few days.When the IR goes loose in the park its up to Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire armed with high heels to come to the rescue of the kids in peril and the park in general. Owen we presume is a sometimes boyfriend of Claire, A navy seal and dinosaur trainer as he seems to have trained Velociraptors like trained dogs. The same Raptors we have been told in earlier films were ruthless, cunning and effective killing creatures. Now they follow orders leading to a ludicrous side plot of having some independent defence contractor hatching a plan to train Raptors for military use in third world countries.I think Universal is confident that this film will not play in Afghanistan given a region of that country is specifically named in and where its people (already ravaged since 1979 by various wars) would be eaten by the said dinosaurs. I will take this opportunity to remind people I used to gain a dubious pleasure in watching Universal movies specifically to see how long would it be before the black guy died. In fact in the first Jurassic Park, Samuel Jackson did not last long!Now the film is an enjoyable ride, finally we have a functioning theme park with dinosaurs and those scenes look great because part of the movie was actually filmed in a disused theme park. The CGI dinosaurs look good but its noticeable some of the climactic scenes were set in the dark.Directed by relatively newbie Colin Trevorrow who has only previously made one notable indie film directs in an efficient manner but without any of the Spielberg flair (nothing like kids climbing over a fence to escape the dinosaurs but unbeknown to them, the electricity is coming back on.) Marvel Films have shown that these days almost any competent director can shoot a blockbuster action film, after all even that Shakespearean legend Kenneth Branagh has directed a blockbuster superhero film.There is a big problem with the screenplay. Its purely a functional plot lacking in any imagination. It gets to it destination in almost robotic manner. There is hardly any characterisation we know nothing about our heroes except what we can gather from a few broad strokes. Compare this with how we get to know Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough's characters in Jurassic Park, even some of the minor characters were well drawn like Wayne Knight. Here zilch, they are merely to function as heroes or dinosaur fodder.Apart from the preposterous plot about training Raptors for military purposes the whole IR going loose story is based on people entering its pen before determining from its implanted tracker device where the hell she is in the first place.I think Universal is pleased that such a slipshod script has turned out to be a monster hit.",Jurassic World
5,claudio_carvalho,"Predictable, but Entertaining Adventure",6,8 December 2015,"The new Jurassic World, owned by the corporation of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), operates in Isla Nublar, Central America, with dinosaurs genetically created by the InGen Company. The workaholic and uptight manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) receives her nephews Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the boys. Meanwhile the dedicated Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is training four velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) believes that the animal can be trained for military use. When Owen and two other employees go to an isolated paddock to evaluate the new attraction of the park, the hybrid dinosaur Indominus Rex, the animal lures them, kills the two men and flees from the spot. Owen escapes and asks Masrani to kill the Indominus, but he believes his security team can contain and capture the animal that cost lots of money. However the team is destroyed by the Indominus and Claire orders the evacuation of the tourists from the island. But the dangerous pterosaurs escape from the aviary and the place goes havoc. Meanwhile Gray and Zach are riding a gyro-sphere in the restricted area and Claire and Owen seek them out. With the chaos in the island, Vic assumes the command and decides to use the four velociraptors to locate and destroy the Indominus. Will his plan work?""Jurassic World"" is one of those predictable movies that the viewers know what he or she is going to see. However it is an entertaining adventure due to the special effects, the good acting and the music score. The romance between Claire and Owen is totally out of context. The presumption of Masrani piloting the helicopter does not fit well for a successful entrepreneur and business man. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Jurassic World: O Mundo dos Dinossauros"" (""Jurassic World: The Dinosaur World"")",Jurassic World
6,mark.waltz,"The park is finally opened, and I'm not mad about the monster.",4,30 April 2016,"I believe that going to the movies has become a chore, not only because of the cost or the lack of enjoyable subject matter, but simply because if I get a headache at home watching a movie with extremely loud sound like this, it's easier to grab an aspirin. ""Jurassic World"" takes the franchise that Steven Spielberg created more than twenty years ago way too far, showing how ridiculous computer-generated effects have become, and taking away the simplicity that once made going to the movies fun. It has been almost 15 years since the previous ""Jurassic Park"" movie, and what was fun in the first two, rather tedious in the third, has now gone completely over the top, bloody and often aggravating. When dinosaurs start to become clichéd, it's time to move onto other themes.The park that Richard Attenborough dreamed of opening in the original has come to reality, lead to its success by idiot scientists who demand that the dinosaurs are bigger: in size, in teeth and most importantly, in appetite. Shots of the herbivores do bring a sense of peace as the human visitors to the park intermingle with them as if they were simply walking through a cow pasture. But, as cinematically breathtaking as this appears to be, it doesn't change the fact that it has basically learned nothing from the first three films, and messing with perfection at least with the first film is obvious.All the more obviously pathetic in this film is the formula for inclusion of children, visiting the park to meet with their career obsessed aunt, the leading scientist who has no idea how to mingled with human beings let alone children, even her own relatives. She is a very unlikable character, surrounded by a plethora of fools and as scientific as the dialogue is made out to be, it is obviously just pretentious, making for a film where it seems that the dinosaur's eyes should be rolling along with the audiences.Hollywood really needs to get a grip on its unoriginal and obvious greedy obsession with guaranteed box office draws that show little artistic flair. The tension is at its highest when dozens of pterodactyls attack one of the park's common areas. Yes, there are some tender moments here that quiet it down temporarily (such as the caring of the sick brontosaurus), but this just shows me that movie producers today aren't really trying to move onto original ideas and are simply taking the easy way out.",Jurassic World
7,nogodnomasters,WE NEED MORE TEETH,7,12 May 2019,"Owen (Chris Pratt) is ex-navy and works with raptors, eat your heart out Siegfried and Roy. Vincent D'Onofrio plays the human antagonist like Brian Dennehy and has a plan to adapt dinosaurs to military use. Bryce Dallas Howard provides our hero with a love interest because all the best films are love stories. You get the picture, dinosaurs running, flying, and swimming around killing each other and eating grandma who still has a few good years. In the beginning they hint that the audience wants action with bigger and badder dinosaurs, so they do that and sacrifice any aspect of building or creating memorable characters. I would have been happy just to see Jeff Goldblum, as an extra, getting eaten by a dinosaur.The dinosaurs aren't any better than they were 20 years ago. The characters were bland. The film had a loose plot and I kept waiting for it to engage me. The kids weren't even as cute as the first film. Oh Yeah. Chris Pratt runs with dinosaurs, which is apparently a big deal.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Minor swearing such as SOB.",Jurassic World
8,kosmasp,Jurassic Park ... I mean World reloaded,6,11 July 2015,"So they needed how many years to work on that script? But at least the effect people had more to work with, so this is the best looking Jurassic Park movie yet (does it matter if it's called World? Most people will say they watched Jurassic Park, which is just the truth). So while we get a remix version of the first movie with some enhancements (Dinosaur and people-wise), this can be fun to watch.So why ""just"" 6/10? You get Chris Pratt in this, who ""killed"" it (not literally of course), but even if he has some real ""suave"" (scenes), he can't lift this higher than it can get. Visually stunning with some very nice action scenes indeed. Of course there is sequel material to this reboot. And it's as predictable as it gets. Dinosaurs are back (again) and they never looked better (or more ""evolved"") ... a bit more brain would have been nice though",Jurassic World
9,classicsoncall,"""You just went and made a new dinosaur?""",8,21 June 2015,"What's really fascinating here is that the movie seems to be taking a shot at the idea of Jurassic World Theme Park capitalizing on the creation of a bigger and better monster to drive attendance, while the film itself is capitalizing on the same idea to drive movie-goers to hit the theater during it's theatrical release. Obviously the technique works because the movie had the biggest opening box office ever depending on what one reads.So with that thought in mind, I don't know how you go about recapturing the magic of the film that initially ignited the franchise. Back in 1993, the sight of all those magnificent dinos the first time around was a wonder to behold, especially that incredible gallimimus stampede in all it's CGI glory. With ""Jurassic World"" I didn't get won over by a truly unique viewing experience the way I was with ""Jurassic Park"". Sure it was entertaining enough, but with the feel of having seen and done it all before with a different cast of human characters. Personally I wouldn't have minded for Jeff Goldblum to show up here with one of his pithy insights from the first two pictures.As for that Indominus-Rex, I didn't see it as all that much different from your standard variety T-Rex after hearing about all the DNA excavating, gene splicing modification that created it with a splash of base genome raptor enhancement. And then, when it came to the final big dino showdown, the I-Rex got taken out by the grand poobah sea monster. You could see that one coming when the action panned over to lakeside at the amusement park, and it didn't make for a satisfying finish for this viewer.But I'm sure they'll try it again in due time, and I'll just as likely be there once more to take in the spectacle. You can't grow up as a dinosaur fan and miss out on any of this stuff, even if they're making it up as they go.",Jurassic World
10,gavin6942,An Improvement Over Part Three,6,19 July 2015,"A new theme park is built on the original site of Jurassic Park. Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction -- a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine -- escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.This film was going through various stages of development since at least 2003, and who knows how many changes were made in the process. Keira Knightley dropped out, Chris Pratt became the lead actor (something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago) and a virtual unknown was given the director's chair.Typically, by the fourth film in a franchise, the budget is smaller and the film ends up going straight to video. Instead, someone decided to make this the big comeback, and it pays off. Maybe not as good as the original, and arguably a notch below part two, this film easily outdoes part three and made a ton of money in the process.Credit should be given for not doing a ""reboot"" or ""remake"". Although it still confounds me that anyone would try (and succeed) in building a theme park, it works in the storyline. And even though they did not have Malcolm, Grant or pretty much any other main character return, they brought back Dr. Wu (this time a bit more sinister). That was a great choice, and keeps the franchise strong. How a part five is possible, who knows, but it seems bound to happen now.",Jurassic World
11,jboothmillard,Jurassic World,8,29 June 2015,"The original Jurassic Park in 1993 from Steven Spielberg was a big hit and like Terminator 2 made big waves with the use of CGI, the second and third films were predictable but fun, twenty-two years on from the first comes this much anticipated follow-up. Basically twenty- years have passed since the events at Jurassic Park that John Hammond originally created, he has passed away, and InGen has opened a fully functional theme park, resort and facility with attractions and genetically-engineered living and breathing dinosaurs, this new park and tourist attraction has been running successfully for more than a decade and is called Jurassic World, it was built on the same island as the original, Isla Nublar. The Mitchell brothers, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) have travelled there to enjoy exclusive access to everything Jurassic World has to offer, but their aunt, the park's operations manager Claire Dearing (The Help's Bryce Dallas Howard) is too busy recruiting more corporate sponsors and looking for bigger dinosaur attractions to maintain attendance. The InGen scientists have already created the new genetically-modified dinosaur called Indominus Rex, made from DNA of several predatory dinosaurs, as well as modern-day animals like cuttlefish and tree frogs, the park's chief geneticist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), from the original Jurassic Park, is keeping the exact combination a secret. Meanwhile Velociraptor trainer and researcher Owen Grady (Guardians of the Galaxy's Chris Pratt) maintains the wellbeing of the raptors ready for further public displays, Jurassic World CEO Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) wants him to evaluate the Indominus‍ '​ enclosure before the exhibit opens to the public, Owen and Claire once dated but fell out due to her workaholic and his irreverent personality, they inspect the exhibit together, Owen warns Claire though that this new dinosaur is dangerous, as it has not interacted with other species. Owen is also approached by Vic Hoskins, head of InGen security (Vincent D'Onofrio), he believes that the park's four raptors (Blue, Charlie, Delta and Echo) could be trained of military use, but he says that being their alpha means that they cannot be tamed and are uncontrollable. At the Indominus enclosure, Owen and Claire discover that the creature appears to have scaled the wall and escaped, Owen and two other staff enter the enclosure, but this was in fact a trap by the Indominus, who has camouflage abilities, and has ambushed them, faking an escape to make its true breakout from the facility, Owen survives this attack, but the other two men are killed and the Indominus disappears into the jungle. The Asset Containment Unit are sent by Masrani to capture the Indominus alive, but most of the team are killed, and with the dangerous dinosaur heading towards the public attractions Claire has no choice but to order an evacuation of the island, Gray and Zach meanwhile have been exploring the island for some time, they ignore the evacuation warning and wander into the forested area in their gyrosphere, until being attacked by the Indominus. The creature destroys their vehicle, but they get away and survive, and while on foot they come across the ruins of the old Jurassic Park Visitor Center, they also find and repair an old Jeep to drive back to the main park, Owen and Claire searching for them follow their trail, and barely survive an attack by the Indominus themselves. The Indominus continues its rampage, killing many Apatosaurus for sport rather than food, and smashing into the park's pterosaur aviary allowing the flying dinosaurs to escape, Masrani and two soldiers hunting the Indominus in a helicopter are killed in an pterosaur attack when they crash, Gray and Zach arrive at the main park as the pterosaurs attack the visitors, Owen and Claire find them, while armed troops try to overpower the ptersaurs. Backed by InGen security, Hoskins assumes command and Owen reluctantly agrees with him to use the velociraptors to track and kill the Indominus, they follow its scent to the jungle, an attack is launched by the humans, but it is revealed that the Indomnis has raptor DNA, so it can communicate with them to turn against the soldiers. Dr. Wu is helicoptered off the island with dinosaur embryos, to protect his research, Owen, Claire, Zach and Gray find Hoskins in the lab, he reveals a plan to take the remaining dinosaur embryos to create genetically-modified dinosaurian super-weapons, but he is killed by a raptor, the four of them go outside and are confronted by the other raptors, Owen however reestablishes his bond with them, before the Indominus appears. The raptors align with Owen and attack the Indominus, two raptors are killed, knowing they are outmatched Claire releases the Tyrannosaurus Rex to fight with the Indominus, the T. Rex is overpowered until remaining raptor Blue reappears, the overwhelmed Indominus is forced towards the lagoon, where the resident Mosasaurus drags it underwater. In the end the survivors have been evacuated to Costa Rica, Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, mother Karen (Judy Greer) and Scott (Andy Buckley), while Owen and Claire decide they will, ""stick together for survival"", it is unclear what will happen to Jurassic World next, the last moment is the Tyrannosaurus Rex roaring. Also starring Jake Johnson as Lowery, Omar Sy as Barry, Judy Greer as Karen, Lauren Lapkus as Vivian, Brian Tee as Hamada, Katie McGrath as Zara, Andy Buckley as Scott, Jimmy Fallon and Colin Trevorrow (directing) as Mr. DNA. Pratt, Howard, D'Onofrio and the rest of the cast all do their parts well, but the real stars are the dinosaurs, including new mutant Indominus Rex, brought to life by the amazing CGI, and there is plenty of action, chases and grizzly moments to sink your teeth into, it is a highly entertaining sequel, almost reboot in fact, a fantastic science- fiction adventure.

12,ma-cortes,Thrilling and rousing sequel in which a genetically engineered hybrid Tiranosaurus goes berserk and carries out a killing spree,7,28 September 2017,"New chapter subsequently to the famous trilogy that gives exciting , sweeping fun and entertainment provided by giant animals made by means of incredible combination of computer generator -ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and Animatronics models . The Dinosaurs , Tiranosaurus and Velociraptors are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing . This original ideal is based on Michael Crichton's novel and writing credits by David Koepp adapted by screen-writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver ; in addition , the story idea for this film was created by Steven Spielberg and Mark Protosevich to confer the notion of doing another installment in the Jurassic Park franchise . The picture starts on Isla Nublar , a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica , a group of construction workers and animal handlers , and security guards watch the creature within unseen . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . It happens 22 years after the original Jurassic Park failed , the new park also known as Jurassic World where Dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed and it is opened for amusement and business . After years of studying genetics the scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur has been created , being a new hybrid ""attraction"" . During the process , the animal tries to escape , an act which leads to a mass panic , and the death of one of the workers . Meanwhile , the workaholic and stiff-upper-lip manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard , Ron Howard's daughter) has two unexpected visitors , her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) in the park, but she is too busy to give attention to them and asks her assistant to escort the children . And the dedicated worker Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) , helped by Barry (Omar Sy) , is training four Velociraptors and the InGen security guard Vic Hoskins , a greedy man with mean purports (Vincent D'Onofrio) , thinks of these wild animals can be trained for military use . The park attraction in property the Indian magnate Masrani (Irrfan Khan) ; as Jurassic Park's owner brings to various genetic experts (B.D. Wong) and other scientific people to practice embryos and other weird experiments . Later on , during an inspection , a security agent disables the security system so that he can make his surveillance , this enables a huge dinosaur to escape the enclosure . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur : ¨Indominus Rex"" , it means ""Fierce/Untamed King"" in Latin , after the hybrid dinosaur's erratically destructive and murderous nature that exhibits to run amok against the tourists . Then , the two kiddies escape through the park in a Gyrosphere featured in the resort tour , being pursued by the carnivorous animal and things go awry . This is an agreeable entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . Interesting and enjoyable premise about DNA of a prehistoric dinosaur taken from an ancient insect and subsequent scientist experiments leading a extremely lethal creature is wonderfully developed . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Pterodactilos , Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses , Gallimimus stampede , although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Along with a Mosasaurus that shows up soaking a lot of extras in the bleacher section and eating a shark but suggested that when the animal grabs the shark that the whole bleacher section submerge underwater using a hydraulic system so that the audience will be able to see the Mosasaurus feeding underwater . In fact , the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're also some stirring and exciting scenes where the actors give vigorous physical performances . Magnificent FX totally convincing are for combination of models and computer animation from Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas , as well as Phil Tippett effects returning to crew duties as Dinosaur Supervisor, reprising his role from the original film. . As always spectacular music by Michael Giacchino , replacing John Williams , and music in the trailer is a rendition of 'John Williams' original theme , this marks the first ""Jurassic"" film for Michael Giacchino ; and excellent and colorful cinematography by John Schwartzman . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Colin Trevorrow . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . Other entries of this fantastic saga are the followings : ¨Jurassik park¨ by Steven Spileberg followed by ¨Lost world¨ directed again by Spielberg and ¨Jurassik Park III¨ by Joe Johnston . After Jurassic World became the fourth highest grossing film of all time, Jurassic World 2 was announced for 2018 , being directed by J.A. Bayona . The film will appeal to teenagers and grown-up , but no for small kids by violent , realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals.",Jurassic World
13,BA_Harrison,Been there. Done that.,6,22 June 2015,"Jurassic World, the popular dinosaur theme park, has a new attraction: the Indominus Rex, a genetically engineered monster created from the DNA of several different creatures. When it inevitably escapes and begins to chow down on everything in sight, dinosaur wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt) is called upon to help track it down.22 years ago my jaw dropped at the sight of CGI dinosaurs rampaging across the screen in Jurassic Park. Four years later and I wasn't anywhere near as impressed with the inevitable sequel, although that was probably more down to the lousy script than the special effects. 2001 and Jurassic Park III tried to make amends for Part 2 by going large, introducing viewers to the Spinosaurus. But while it may have been bigger, it didn't do the trick for most people—dinosaurs were so last millennium.The people behind the Jurassic Park franchise have wisely waited for a new generation of dinosaur fans before trying again. Now, fourteen years later, the park is once again open for business—and, boy, has it been doing a roaring trade, with record takings at the box office. It's spectacular, blockbuster entertainment for the masses, but the problem—for me at least—is that I've seen it all before: Jurassic World might feature a few new attractions, but it's essentially the same thing all over again. Not only was I bored by the predictability of proceedings, but I also became irritated by the excess of CGI, the lack of genuine suspense, the logic-free script, and the regular blatant product placements.The next time Isla Nublar opens for more dinosaur mayhem (given the money this film has made, I think that is a certainty), I reckon I'll save some cash and stay at home.5.5/10, generously rounded up to 6 for featuring my favourite dinosaur, the ankylosaurus.",Jurassic World
14,paul_haakonsen,Essentially unnecessary eye-candy...,6,30 June 2016,"I only got around to watch the fourth installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise about a year after it was released upon the world. Why? Well, after a steadily sloping series of movies, then I wasn't in any particular hurry to get around to watch the most recent of the movies, it being ""Jurassic World"".And now having seen it, I must admit that this was visually a beautiful movie. As was the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie back in 1993 when it was first released. And it did offer some adequate entertainment, for sure. But everything here had essentially been presented to the audience throughout the course of the three previous movies. Sure there was the thing with the Indominus Rex creation that stood out. But wasn't it just a twist on the gene manipulation and reproduction that essentially sparked the first dinosaur in the first movie?The acting in the movie was good, although you should not expect any great thespian or Shakespearian moments throughout the course of the movie. People did adequate jobs with what they had to work with from a fairly limiting script and storyline.The CGI is what carried this movie, as it has been with the entire series since the first movie. And the dinosaurs are quite life-like and realistic to look at - taking into consideration that we only got fossils to compare appearances with.The movie does bear some sarcastic permeation of American consumerism, in terms of everything has to be bigger and better. And look how it turned out in the first, second and third movie. So it makes you wonder why they still haven't learned their lesson and continued on with a new dinosaur amusement park.While ""Jurassic World"" is certainly an entertaining movie and a visual treat for the eyes, then it is hardly a revolutionary movie, nor is it a movie that really were particularly necessary to the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise.",Jurassic World
15,Quinoa1984,a fun B movie with A-movie credentials,5,19 June 2015,"I look at Jurassic World and I end up holding it up to other movies that are out now as well as the original Jurassic Park and its sequels. It's hard not to, when we live in a film world that gives us Godzilla (some decent monster action, practically non-existent humans) and the new Planet of the Apes films (which has two of this movie's co-writers, and has arguably greater CGI/mo-cap and writing). What Colin Trevorrow and producer Steven Spielberg do here - and make no mistake, this is very much a Spielberg production - is try to give the monster-movie-CGI-heavy blockbuster a jump-start with things that are familiar as well as new creatures, new peril, and a much bigger park. This time it's open, folks, and this place must have a helluva insurance premium.You know the set up and what'll happen as soon as you see the trailer, or just read the following sentence: the scientists in Jurassic World have 'designed' a dinosaur hybrid (we don't know everything that's in it, which is part of the mystery), and because it's been in captivity all its life, it's extra-dangerous and unfamiliar with the world around it. So, yes, in short, dinosaur breaks out, wreaks havoc, other dinosaurs spring loose, and the velociraptors are used to try and track this other big 'Indominus Rex' down. Yeah, wait, what? Jurassic World certainly delivers on the peril, on some clever lines and witty banter - especially between Chris Pratt, as the Navy-Seal turned raptor hunter, and businessy-turned-sorta-bad-ass Bryce Dallas-Howard - and there are some legitimately funny turns of the story. One such one is when a villain gets the perfunctory monologue about his ""real"" plans cut-off by another dinosaur. And when the dinosaur action really kicks in, mostly in the last third, it has some umph to it and is directed slickly and with some tension.What the movie may be missing for me is a full-on 'wow' factor of it. For kids this movie may be the bees knees. For an adult, as I now am, it wasn't very scary (no no, no 'six-foot turkey' comments for now). By this I mean, even though the action is well-staged and it has that solid, Spielberg-sense of direction where you always know where everyone is, the surprises feel genuine, and if there's any excess it feels like it's all in the brazen fun of what the Jurassic series is, when the suspense happens it kind of comes quickly, like the Rex attacks. Part of this for me is that, as good as the CGI is here, I miss the practical dinosaurs of the Stan Winston age. Only once is there a dinosaur that is actually *there* on the screen, and it's for a moment where it would've been silly to have an animated one otherwise.This isn't to take away from how cool they do look, on the whole. There was never a moment where I thought any of the fakeness took away from the action. If anything the velociraptors, at least in close-up, look better than they ever have (in computer form, I should say). But this is a gripe that I couldn't shake, and still put it a notch below what the WETA folks did with the Apes movies - perhaps more on par with the work in Godzilla last year. As for the humans on screen, they all have charismatic and interesting actors, including Irrfan Khan as the new John Hammond (this time he can work a helicopter). Do they all get dimensions? Some more than others; the kids here basically have two molds, with maybe just a hint of bonding over the course of their escape-from-dinosaur peril. And one of the stranger things is to see BD Wong here, the only carry-over from 'Park', now as a corrupted scientist-engineer. It's like if I were to see Walter Peck in the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot: like, OK, cool, uh, hey again...Jurassic World does its job better than the previous two sequels - there's no real annoyances with the characters, or involving gymnastics or whatever - and is worthy of a matinée, adults and kids included. The best it could've been though is hard to say.",Jurassic World
16,tavm,Jurassic World was a worthy sequel in the series though I only previously watched The Lost World before this one,8,15 June 2015,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, who had seen this a couple of times before. I myself had read Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park and seen The Lost World but not the other two movies in the series. I thought most of the action sequences were awesome. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard certainly had some chemistry with their back-and-forth dialogue. The fact that Ms. Howard got to save Chris in one scene was also cool to see. The boy teen and his younger brother were also fine when they were dealing with the chaos around them. Reading the notes on this site, I was pleasantly surprised that this was partly shot in New Orleans, where I live a two-hour drive from, in the abandoned Six Flags park there and some other buildings there. Oh, and knowing Jimmy Buffett makes a cameo was something I knew beforehand but my friend didn't so he was surprised when I told him. In summary, Jurassic World was a worthy sequel to watch.",Jurassic World
17,michaelRokeefe,Awesome dinosaur action.,8,13 June 2015,"The JURASSIC PARK franchise continues with not exactly a sequel, but maybe a reboot of the 1993 classic. Some 20 years have passed and those tragedies are about forgotten. The original park has been modified, expanded into a ""World"" and is destination of throngs of tourists and visitors that believe in a reality that dinosaurs are back. To boost energy in sales, the park's owner Simon Masrani(Irrfan Khan)finances the creation of a hybrid dinosaur, called The Indominous Rex. Cost is no matter; although security is.Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard)is the frenetic park manager working at a breathless pace trying to ensure everything runs smoothly for Masrani's big reveal of the new attraction. This particular weekend is when she is to babysit her estranged nephews, Gray(Ty Simpkins) and Zach(Nick Robinson). Aided by Claire's neglected attention, the boys manage to get adventurous and put themselves into danger. Chris Pratt plays Owen, an old flame from Claire's past, who is an acclaimed dinosaur expert and trainer of raptors, that is called on to help in safety before the big introduction of Indominous Rex.Of course, all is not well. The new attraction is smart enough to escape and other creatures of Jurassic World are on the menu. That also means staff, crew and thousands of visitors are also in danger of being dino chow. JURASSIC WORLD is action filled, loud and visually awesome. Flawless CGI and there is some fright factor to sustain attention. A summer blockbuster, yes. THE summer blockbuster...it is remained to be seen.The cast also features: Vincent D'Onofrio, BD Wong, Omar Sy, Jake Johnson, Lauran Lapkus, Brian Tee and Judy Greer.",Jurassic World
18,sunwarrior13,Danger At The Theme Park,9,6 November 2016,"Steven Spielberg,the director of Jurassic Park and The Lost World:The Jurassic Park, returns as the new executive producer of the Jurassic Park film series in this new film known as Jurassic World.This is the fourth installment of the series that presents a cast that includes Chris Pratt,Bryce Dallas Howard,Vincent D'Onofrio,Ty Simpkins,Nick Robinson,Omar Sy and B. D. Wong with Colin Trevorrow taking over the movie's director.Twenty-two years after the events of the Jurassic Park,a theme park that has cloned dinosaurs was made at a fictional island called Isla Nublar,which is located off the Pacific coast of Central America.The park has successfully operated for the last ten years.But things go wrong when a genetically created dinosaur known as Indominus rex escapes and breaks lose causing extreme danger into the park.All breaks lose as the people try to manage to survive the event.The fourth Jurassic Park film was definitely nostalgic in the sense that it tries to provide more scares and violence coming from the newly cloned dinosaurs.It was a good idea to have an operational theme park as a setting since this was probably the main purpose of having this cloned dinosaur in the first three films.At least,they finally found a way to have an operational theme park and have achieved that objective.Since the sequels The Lost World:The Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III,the viewers are once again treated to a darker film that focuses on the danger presented by the cloned dinosaurs as compared to the characters involved despite having Claire's transformation from a corporate woman who hates dinosaurs into becoming a warrior-like woman who is more appreciative of animals in the end.Terror film lovers will surely appreciate this film for it will definitely brought the entertainment they require from a movie.No wonder it earned more than a billion dollars when it was released world- wide.",Jurassic World
19,hitchcockthelegend,Untamable Devil.,7,24 November 2015,"One thing that would be 100% guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World, is that whatever the quality, or lack of, the notices would be mixed. Thus the reactions would be akin to those that ""Indiana Jones 4"" received, charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etc.Jurassic World does exactly what is expected of it, it's a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun, complete with outstanding effects, monster mayhem and moments of dumbness. In fact it's very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg's deft touch.There's a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce's high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it's a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it's some sort of series disgrace. 7/10",Jurassic World
20,Theo Robertson,Predictable But Very Enjoyable,8,14 June 2015,"Scientists and corporate companies never learn do they ? Surely Universal Studios cant be so short of money that they need to resurrect a franchise that finished fifteen years ago ? That said dinosaurs have an absolute fascination to humans in general and children in particular and I used to love these dinosaur movies courtesy of Ray Harryhausen and who can forget the classic DOCTOR WHO story Invasion Of The Dinosaurs where the population of London has to get evacuated due to the sudden appearance of papier mache reptiles . In short you can't go wrong with dinosaurs if you're after mass commercial appeal . Despite the dangers of flogging a dead horse Universal are probably playing things a bit safe by bringing out another franchise film And play it safe they do . There's not a lot of originality on display here and much of the first half plays out as you might expect it . These greedy corporate capitalists have changed the balance of nature by opening a theme park featuring animals that died out tens of millions of years ago and worse than that they've modified the dinosaurs so that not only do you think you're watching a retread of the original JURASSIC PARK movies complete with the same musical soundtrack you're also watching a reworking of The Company from the ALIEN movies . This is also reflected in the rather one note , thin characters who populate the story At this point you might start worrying Universal fleeced out of the price of a cinema ticket and you're getting more of the same that you got with the first three films but the saving grace here is just how nasty things get . My problem with the second JP is once the action switches to mainland America there's not much in the way of a high body count , This is certainly not a problem here and director Colin Trevorrow knows what the audience wants and gives it to them by the bucket load as numerous faceless red shirt types suffer all sorts of spectacular deaths . It might sound a little bit mean but I was surprised as to how enjoyable the action scenes were . Spectacular deaths and dinosaurs ? What more do you want from a blockbuster ?",Jurassic World
21,Hey_Sweden,Dino might!,7,9 January 2017,"It's been quite some time since the initial disaster on Isla Nublar, and the late John Hammonds' dream of a fully functioning dinosaur theme park has finally come to fruition. Thousands flock to an island paradise where they see the mighty lizards put on display. Naturally, since this is meant to be a thrill ride, colossal human error will dictate that our ferocious antagonists get loose and wreak havoc on park visitors and personnel. Chief among them is a genetic freak called an ""Indominus Rex"", created because at this point people supposedly consider ordinary dinosaurs passe.One has to put up with some ridiculous, insipid characters and lame dialogue in this, the most recent entry in this ongoing franchise, but if all you want is to see big lizards run about and attack and eat people, you'll get it. Director Colin Trevorrow, with the assistance of such talents as production designer Ed Verreaux, cinematographer John Schwartzman, and editor Kevin Stitt, is able to create lots of brainless thrills. And make no mistake, it is pretty brainless. There are the standard absurdities to tolerate on the way to enjoying ""Jurassic World"". The main ones would be these human characters. This viewer certainly wouldn't have minded seeing most of them, if not all of them, become dinosaur chow. Surviving with his dignity intact is studly Chris Pratt, as a guy who's actually succeeded in training raptors. Forced to play a real archetype is Vincent D'Onofrio as a schemer who believes the ""Indominus Rex"" and the raptors would make excellent military weapons.The dinos, of course, are the *real* stars of this show. The visual effects are generally pretty good, and we see menaces that also include an enormous swimming mosasaur and numerous pterodactyls. Things get a little too precious, however, when we consider the bond that Pratt has developed with his raptor friends.The finale pulls out all the stops for any lover of dinosaur cinema, so things do end on a reasonably high note.Seven out of 10.",Jurassic World
22,LeonLouisRicci,Too Big to Fail,5,23 December 2015,"There was Never any Doubt about the Profit margin in the making of this Reboot or Sequel or Series Continuation. The Audience is built in, ready to Go and Spend, Spend, Spend, until the Movie approaches the now attainable Billion Dollar Commodity.This is Product First and Art second. No one involved down to the CGI Filler Artist, had any reservations about how this Picture would be Consumed. So the Creative process from the Idea to Script, to Finished Film was never in danger of being a Loser and that is hardly an Inspiration for the Imagination.That's exactly what this Film became and is, a Prefabricated Movie with just the required amount of effort and Wha-La, let's all go to the Bank. There's something to be said about the ""Struggling Artist"".The Movie is Mediocre, considering, passable Popcorn Entertainment. The 3-D does its job, the Sound System strains to Impress, the CGI is Expensively Slick, the Characters and the Actors delivering the One-Dimensional People to the Screen are the least impressive of the Package.The Story is Lame, considering, and seems Trite, Recycled, and frankly quite Dull. The new Hybrid Dino is Unimpressive and You have to look closely to Differentiate the T-Rex. The Raptors as Trained Military Might is Hardly anything Surprising, and in the End, handled Awkwardly.Overall, this is an OK Film and it delivers, somewhat, the Stuff it is Selling. A minor Disappointment because the True Wonder of the First Series, just like the Story here, is ""Old-Hat"". The Joke going around when the first Film was released...""You can't tell the fake dinosaurs from the real ones.""

23,CinemaSerf,Jurassic critters run wild (again)...,7,16 September 2020,"Now then, as stories go this is an huge pile of dino-droppings - but Chris Pratt does his level best, alongside some pretty bad-assed dinosaurs to keep this action adventure exciting. When the new ""Jurassic World"" theme park is opened, it builds on the promise of it's doomed predecessor but this time, they have state of the art safety facilities to protect the visiting lunch box brigade. Or do they? Unfortunately for them, ""Indominus Rex"", wasn't at the read-through and has a mind to eat just about anything he can wrap his jaws around. What he can't devour, his eager - recently released - friends from elsewhere in the park are plenty keen on too - so we quickly find ourselves with a ""containment anomaly"" that leads to a distinct carnage scenario for our hero to avert. As ever, Pratt brings oodles of personality to his role as the velociraptor's pal, but the rest of the cast - to an human - are poor. The kids grate and ought to have been eaten very early on, and gazillionaire Irrfan Khan (""Masrani"") is way to dapper and refined to be a convincing baddie. Vincent D'Onofio tries to help out, at least his part has some meat to it, but otherwise this is just a cracking victory for Pratt and some outstanding visual effects without even a rousing score from John Williams to rely upon and some storylines that are contrived to maximise the menace and minimise the plausibility. If you can find it showing on a big screen anywhere, then it is still worth watching on a wet afternoon, but it loses much of any potency it ever had on the small screen and I'm not sure I'd bother again.",Jurassic World
24,utgard14,"""Maybe progress should lose for once.""",7,12 October 2015,"The fourth Jurassic Park film (and, given its success, not the last) is being hailed as the best since the original, with eyebrow-raising claims from some corners that it is as good as or even better than the original. Well that claim is patently absurd since this movie offers nothing unique of its own, but rather plays with the groundwork laid by the previous movies (particularly the first). Jurassic Park was an instant classic that had a little bit of everything. This one is just a very good movie and, yes, it's probably the best of the sequels so far. I did like the third one better than many did, however. The cast here is decent, with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both likable leads. The two little kids are kind of forgettable, though, and the character played by Vincent D'Onofrio is straight out of the Big Book of Clichéd Villains. The script is good with plenty of humor and nods to the first film. Michael Giacchino's rousing score is nice but tries a little too hard at times to match John Williams (an impossible task). What everyone watches a movie like this for is the dinosaur action and this has that in spades. We get regular dinos and souped-up genetically engineered hybrid dinos, as well as the fan favorite velociraptors figuring into things in a clever way. The special effects are great and the monster fight climax is kick-ass. If you go into it with just the expectation of being entertained, you'll have fun watching it. If you go in expecting to be 'wowed' like you were with the first Jurassic Park, then you'll probably be a little underwhelmed by it. It's a good movie but it doesn't offer much that it can call its own.",Jurassic World
25,zardoz-13,"Pathetic Compared to Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" Entries",2,22 June 2015,"""Safety Not Guaranteed"" director Colin Trevorrow's summer blockbuster ""Jurassic World"" surpasses director Joe Johnston's lackluster ""Jurassic Park 3"" (2001). Comparatively, Steven Spielberg's infinitely superior ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) covered most of what transpires in Trevorrow's new the monster-run-amok-in-a-theme-park movie. Despite its attractive cast and scenic jungle locations, ""Jurassic World"" delivers considerably less suspense in its standard-issue shenanigans about juveniles in jeopardy. If you haven't seen the first and second entries in the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, this franchise reboot with its polished production values and robust 3-D might amaze you, especially if you're sixteen years old or younger. Size is the primary factor ""Jurassic World"" contends with, and Trevorrow shrewdly addresses this liability during the first half-hour. The female protagonist who manages the dinosaur park concedes, ""No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore. They need to be bigger, louder and with more teeth!"" Indeed, the new hybrid dinosaur that a fiendish scientist has concocted represents a leap forward. Nevertheless, this 50 feet long and 18 feet high monster doesn't really emerge as that monstrous. The Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" could serve as ""Godzilla's"" seeing-eye dog. Moreover, ""Jurassic World"" appears to have been designed to sell plastic toy dinosaurs. The dinos themselves display a clean-scrubbed, laminated look. When the franchise first rampaged across screens with ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and its sequel ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" (1997), nothing looked either more realistic or intimidating than those truculent dinosaurs, especially the Raptors. Unfortunately, the time when ""Jurassic Park"" set new benchmarks for CGI is long past. The people who made ""Jurassic World"" must have ignored Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" (2005) as well as ""Godzilla"" (2014). In an arena with either of those, the welterweight Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" wouldn't last a minute. Meantime, scenarists Rick Jaffa &Amanda Silver, who did such a praiseworthy job with ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" along with writer Rick Connolly, and Trevorrow, have drummed-up a 'so-so sauraus' saga. The logistics of the plot don't hold up to scrutiny and the action is outlandish. Worse, the scripters have contrived one-dimensional characters who often behave idiotically in formulaic predicaments. For example, Bryce Dallas Howard, who was such a revelation as a villainess in ""The Help,"" spends her entire time charging around in high heels either in the jungle or on asphalt! Chris Pratt plays a former Navy troubleshooter who doesn't have a lick of sense. He totes around a modern .45-70 lever-action carbine reminiscent of Buffalo Bill, when he should be armed with something more substantial, like a Kalashnikov AK-101 assault rifle with 40mm GP-30 under-the-barrel grenade launcher. One Jurassic World security trooper wields a powerful M136 AT4, a Swedish-made single-shot 84mm unguided light anti-tank recoilless rocket launcher. He takes aim with this fearsome weapon at the genetically modified dinosaur. Naturally, like all myopic, action movie villains, none of these expendable troopers can hit the broad side of a barn, much less a gigantic, galloping dinosaur! Meantime, since the dinosaurs have neither slippery lawyers nor treacherous laboratory employees to gobble, the writers have substituted a different villain, a security specialist who dreams about adapting these carnivorous Raptors for real world combat against terrorists. Not surprisingly, everything about this lightweight, family-oriented, PG-13 rated epic is immaculate. Bloodshed is restricted to a drop or two of runny ketchup. Sure, you see the dinosaurs munch on many adults, but the two imperiled children suffer no broken legs, no sprained ankles, or lose any limbs. Specifically, anonymous bystanders are the only ones that are crunched, scratched, or traumatized. So forget about suspense and tension.Over twenty years ago, in the original ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, genial billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) fantasized about opening a dinosaur park on a remote island near Costa Rica. Initially, everything went fine, but then some predatory velociraptors and a cantankerous Tyrannosaurus rex ruined it for everybody. Now, twenty years later, Indian billionaire Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan of ""Life of Pi"") has taken over Jurassic Park as the new owner, and he has committed himself whole-heartedly to perpetuating Hammond's dream. He wants both the dinosaurs to enjoy quality of life while the visitors to have a blast. Conversely, Masrani's workaholic chief of operations, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of ""The Help""), struggles to maintain that profit margin. This means the Park must constantly add new attractions because new attractions spike attendance. When fiendish but taciturn scientist, Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong of ""Focus""), devises a new dinosaur, he refuses to share his secret formula with Masrani and Claire. Predictably, chaos ensues with disastrous results. The Indominus rex is smarter than the average dinosaur, and this creature fools everybody, including the impertinent but heroic Owen Grady (Chris Pratt of ""Guardians of the Galaxy""), who struggles to train a quartet of beady-eyed Velociraptors. Using prehistoric lizards like bloodhounds is preposterous but amusing, and the bond Grady develops with these overgrown kangaroo-like predators is unconvincing. Eventually, Grady pursues the Indominus with them, while the Indominus kills on other dinosaurs and crashes into the park's pterosaur aviary to free flocks of their airborne predators.Before he helmed ""Jurassic World,"" Colin Trevorrow directed some Internet shorts, a made-for-TV movie, and a superb little 2012 indie flick entitled ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" with Mark Duplass. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" was an amiable character-driven comedy of errors. In ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" a couple of journalists investigated a crackpot who has published a newspaper ad soliciting partners to accompany him on a trip back in time. These time travel candidates are advised to bring their own weapons. Reportedly, movie mogul Steven Spielberg liked Trevorrow's film enough to sign him up to direct ""Jurassic World."" If you're a parent, ""Jurassic World"" serves not only as ideal entertainment for kids, but also a great way to interest them in dinosaur memorabilia. Otherwise, as far as adults are concerned, the pedestrian ""Jurassic World"" exemplifies a case of suspense not guaranteed.""",Jurassic World

Oh, and throw in some out-of-the-blue, no context, implausible romance too, in case the movie wasn't stupid enough.Characters are one-dimensional and pretty much cardboard cutouts of your your standard action/horror movie categories. There's the sensitive hero, the neutral party who becomes a hero, the well- meaning person who causes the calamity (and tends to die), the unlikable guy who you know is going to meet a sticky end at the hand of the dinosaurs, a wise ass who makes heaps of cynical quips but never contributes anything constructive, hapless kids, other innocents caught in the middle whose survival depends on how innocent they actually are, and/or how nondescript they are (more nondescript means more expendable).There's a pretense of setting the scene for the movie, but this really just wastes time and pads the film.

Russia has proved that if a country has a yearning for another peninsula, it can just snatch the one of its choice and no one else will do anything. Therefore, if you read between the lines, JURASSIC WORLD is suggesting that America and\or its multinational billionaires should latch onto an island few people would miss, such as Costa Rica or Hawaii. Step Two would be reviving new and improved dinosaurs through gene-splicing. (This is NOT far-fetched. Today's frequent deconstruction of robed people roaming the streets of yesteryear by means of drone-fired ""Hellfire"" missiles--as in the current flick GOOD KILL--is far scarier than the most frightening UFO flicks of a few years ago.) Finally, as this movie states, ""No one's impressed with dinosaurs anymore."" But JURASSIC WORLD shows us that the average T-Rex must eat 30 or 40 people daily to survive. Since China and India each have a billion folks to spare, plus umpteen millions of excess Americans, soon we can expect an internet gold mine to be in operation live-streaming the daily arrival of 20,000 ""Guests"" for feeding time on a real JURASSIC WORLD island.",Jurassic World

While relative unknown indie director Colin Trevorrow makes the most earnest effort to be worthy of being in Steven Spielberg's shadow the screenplay collaborated with committee by design of Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connolly labors to more or less carbon copy the formula of its predecessors: gee what could go possibly wrong with humans in a dinosaur populated environment? Pratt is laser-focused surprisingly ala Tom Cruise but gets by on his regular guy schtick while Dallas Howard's nearly-inhuman corporate queen bee defrosts mid-way thru the adventure to save her estranged, visiting nephews Simpkins and Lapkus who barely breeze by being borderline boring and obnoxious (thankfully they too get to shirk their tropes as pencil-thin characterizations of big brother and little brother).

As for me, I saw Age of Ultron and I held on to my precious dollars until this highly anticipated film.Jurassic World set a single day record this weekend bringing in $511M internationally and $209M domestically. That's an insane amount of money. I never expected it to do that well. I'm old enough to have seen Jurassic Park in 1993 and that movie was a game changer, an absolute classic. Jurassic World was good, but record setting good??? I wouldn't say that.Jurassic World looked to me like a remake of Jurassic Park with more people and the assumption that you know all of the DNA stuff. Again there were two kids without their parents, a male hero somewhat knowledgeable of the animals, a fat guy looking for a chance to exploit the dinosaurs, a security system not quite up to snuff and a big toothed predator on the loose. Of course there were some storyline differences to differentiate it from the original as well as the other two sequels; and there were shades of Deep Blue Sea and Man's Best Friend.The characters were bearable enough although there was an interesting dynamic between the kids and their aunt whom they were visiting. If you don't get too caught up into the characters and the potential symbolism of each of them then you can really enjoy the movie. This is just a purely entertaining movie of man v. beast with some excellent ""oooh"" moments.",Jurassic World
30,neil-476,Great fun,8,12 June 2015,"20 years after the disastrous events at Jurassic Park, the late John Hammond's company finally have this business of breeding dinosaurs and keeping them efficiently contained in a nature theme park environment sorted. Consequently it is a complete surprise when things go horribly wrong at Jurassic World. Well, of course it is, obviously they never watched Westworld. Park boss Claire, who is supposed to be looking after her vacationing nephews, finds herself at odds with velociraptor trainer Owen, while security honcho Hoskins has his own agenda. Not that genetically engineered monster carnivore Indomitus Rex gives much of a monkey's.Spielberg's Jurassic Park was a groundbreaker – believable photorealistic dinosaurs on screen! It is still a good film, albeit maybe a little leisurely in getting under way. Episode 2 was also relaxed in setting up the jeopardy, albeit the dinos were a lot busier, and there were more of them. Episode 3 didn't really catch fire for me.But episode 4 starts off full pelt and never lets up. And it has a number of narrative arcs to follow, and they interweave nicely – it's not as empty as Mad Max: Fury Road, there is actually a plot to follow, not just eye candy. The action is non-stop, very well staged, and always convincing. And the final sequence is thrilling.It is worth catching this in 3D: the 3D is excellent.",Jurassic World
31,evanston_dad,"One Dinosaur, Two Dinosaur, Red Dinosaur, Blue Dinosaur",6,10 January 2016,"Oh, will those crazy dinosaur-creating scientists never learn? As if all the people gobbled up by giant reptilians run amok over the course of three previous movies wasn't enough, a giant corporation thinks it's a grand idea to open Jurassic World, the Sea World of dinosaurs. And because dinosaurs have become de rigeur, audiences demand bigger and meaner ones if they are to continue buying tickets. Thus, a team of geneticists manufacture monsters intended to satisfy customers, until they do too good a job and create one that's a sort of super hero and has all the best traits from various other dinosaurs combined into one. When it escapes from its pen, things go predictably badly.Once I recovered from the disappointment of realizing that Bryce Dallas Howard was not going to be swallowed up or torn apart by the movie's end, I was able to settle in and enjoy this movie for what it was, which is a game if somewhat lacking attempt to recreate the roller coaster thrills of Steven Spielberg's first installment. Remember that one, that ancient relic of a movie that came out way back in 1993? Yes, it's so old I'm surprised it was even in color. Of course we need a reboot -- God forbid anyone should be bothered to push a button and stream the original from any number of available services.""Jurassic World"" has lots of set pieces that sound good on paper, and they manage to offer up a moderate does of entertainment, but there's something lacking from the whole enterprise that made the first one so special. It's got the same slick production values and technical wizardry (though the visual effects in the first one look better than the ones in this, despite being more than 20 years old). But it feels like a movie written and directed by a committee; you never appreciate Spielberg's ability to direct an action sequence until you see someone try to imitate him.Chris Pratt, once again, is not up to the nominal challenge of the role he's been given. Every time I see him in a movie, he's just missing whatever essential quality the character he's playing needs in order to work. In ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" it was a roguish scruffiness. In this, it's a macho resourcefulness. But he's never convincing as anything other than a pretty boy bro. It's like ordering Indiana Jones and getting a doofus frat boy.The most memorable sequence in the movie is one where a flock of pterodactyls swoops down on the unsuspecting visitors to the theme park and wreak all kinds of havoc. The rest of the movie is a blur.Grade: B",Jurassic World
32,ferguson-6,Chaos Theory,6,21 June 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. I'm guessing that most anyone who enjoys movies and is at least 30 years old, has vivid recollections of Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park from1993. The iconic theme from John Williams, that initial awe-inspiring look at the dinosaurs grazing in the valley, the reminder that ""objects are closer than they appear"" in side mirrors, and the late Sir Richard Attenborough stating that he ""spared no expense"" in creating the park  all merged to became part of an incredibly moving and huge new movie theatre experience. This latest (and fourth in the franchise) offers us ""big"", but very little ""new"", and unfortunately nothing very ""moving"" in its presentation.Set two decades after the tragic and messy park trial run of that original movie, we find Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help) managing the financially-challenged theme park owned by Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi). Chris Pratt is training Velociraptors, while BD Wong is cooking up hybrid and genetically modified monsters such as Indominus Rex – designed to excite the audiences who have become bored with an old-fashioned T-Rex.Even though this is technically a sequel, there are numerous similarities to the original film, and a fun parlor game consists of spotting all the homage's and tributes sprinkled throughout. Two of my favorites are the ""Winston's"" shop in the park, and the ViewMaster shot early on. These two are tips of the cap to Stan Winston and Ray Harryhausen  two giants in the world of special effects.In what has become the Hollywood ""go to"" for evil-doers, the secret plan to militarize the dinosaurs is being carried out by Vincent D'Onofrio. Of course, this clashes with Pratt's ideal life for ""his"" trainees. The mandatory kids-in-peril are played by Ty Simpkins (Insidious) and Nick Robinson. Much has been made of the absurdity of Ms. Howard's numerous scenes of sprinting in high heels, and I found her overall demeanor to be every bit as exaggerated and unbelievable as her actions in heels. Jake Johnson (TV's ""New Girl) and Omar Sy (so wonderful in The Intouchables) were the most ""real"" characters, though neither was given much to do.Much of what is written here is ""in comparison"" to the original. While this may not be fair, it is inescapable when dealing with such a respected and iconic film. Youngsters unfamiliar with the original film, are likely to find this one exciting – even terrifying at times – and that's an important distinction to make. The Mosasaurus alone is worth the price of admission  and good for a few nightmares! And who among us wouldn't pay up for a Baby Triceratops ride in the Petting Zoo? For the Jurassic Park stalwarts, the inconsistent (sometimes great, sometimes fake-looking) CGI will be as tough to overlook as Ms. Howard's cartoon character. And yes, composer Michael Giacchino is new to the Jurassic series, and he is wise enough to work in the terrific and familiar John Williams theme in more than one scene. However, none of the downsides will keep the true fans away, and there is an entire generation of kids who should have the chance to marvel at lifelike dinosaurs on the big screen courtesy of director Colin Trevorrow (previously known for his work on the indie gem Safety Not Guaranteed).",Jurassic World
33,anaconda-40658,Best One Since the First.,6,23 June 2015,"Jurassic World (2015): Dir: Colin Trevorrow / Cast: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins, Vincent D'Onofrio: Best sequel to the original 1993 monster hit about enhancing yesterday's wonders. For whatever reason the park is opened again and the new creature in town is made up of DNA from the T-Rex and the raptors. Chris Pratt plays the film's hero who is busy training raptors to obey his commands. He doesn't agree with this new creature called Idominus and once this creature escapes it wrecks havoc killing other dinosaurs and people as sport. This will arrive at the ultimate clash of teeth when only one answer remains. Pratt holds his own patrolling through the jungles on a three wheeler and narrowly avoiding death. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the park operations manager who once had a relationship with Pratt. He disagrees with her new methods of promotion and she soon has no choice but to accept his knowledge of the creatures to survive. She has two nephews visiting for which she has no time to see. These two nitwits wander off in a circular vehicle and end up within the midst of Idominus battling other creatures as well as pursue them. One of the film's most depraved scenes regards Dallas's assistant, who was to watch the kids, get snatched from the ground while pterosaurs play a game of air catch with her body until a captive marine creature devours them both. Vincent D'Onofrio plays the cardboard villain who ends up becoming a raptor big mac. Pointless chaos with numerous people tossed to the teeth but the dinosaurs are the ticket and the brawl is on in full detail in their world. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Jurassic World
34,AaronCapenBanner,The Park Goes Global,7,13 April 2016,"22 years after the disastrous events of the first film, a new park(renamed World) was built upon the ruins of the original, and has been a huge success for about a decade, but an increasingly apathetic public has led the new corporate owners to authorize an experimental dinosaur created from various DNA sources that is large, fierce, and intelligent, so naturally breaks free of its paddock to wreck havoc, creating a domino effect of calamities that will lead to even more destruction and loss of life. Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt co-star, as does returning actor B.D. Wong as Dr. Henry Wu from the first film.Fourth film in this series was a massive hit, effectively updating the story to 2015 and a new generation. Good plot and characters, exciting action by director Colin Trevorrow, though of course this is(intentionally) much like the original.Ending of course sets up the planned Part V...",Jurassic World
35,FlashCallahan,What kind of diet doesn't allow tequila?....,8,14 June 2015,"Everybody.........Remain..........Calm..........The Jurassic World luxury resort, located off the coast of Costa Rica, provides a habitat for a plethora of dinosaurs, including the vicious, intelligent, and man made, Indominus rex. When the creature escapes, it sets off an event that causes the other dinosaurs to run wild. Now, it's up to a former Naval officer, and Velociraptor expert to use his special skills, and knowledge of Harrison Fords two biggest roles, to save two young brothers and the rest of the tourists from the Dinosaur rampage......Forgetting the events of the other sequels, Jurassic World is a big nostalgia trip straight from the word go, and my advice is, see it on the biggest screen, with he biggest speakers, and revel in the spectacle, because its a popcorn movie of the highest order.It never tries to out Park, Jurassic Park, that would be silly thing to do, but it's harks back to the original movie, especially in the second act, where it literally goes back to Jurassic Park. And this is the films biggest plus, and it's biggest minus.All the references to the original, Score, merchandise, the original cars and those light up head binoculars, remind you of just what a movie Jurassic Park was, and how this will never be regarded as a bonafide 'classic'.JP had character that were developed, as well as the spectacle, and here, we don't have that depth of characterisation. You rarely care for the two children who are in peril, because in the original, they were referencing the nuclear family, and Dr. Grant warmed to them, and in turn, warmed to the idea of having children. Here they are just implemented to make Howard feel guilty for working too hard.Pratt is good, he provides the movies few funny moments, but at times, he appears like he is just there to audition for Indiana Jones for the Exec. producer.But the set pieces are spectacular, and ironically, it's the velociraptors who steal the film from everyone, they are truly terrifying in a 'are they listening now, or not?' because at times, you are not sure which camp they are going to attack.And as for the final fifteen minutes, if you got excited at the rippling water in the cups from the original, it's beyond brilliant. Let's just say, the moment a flare is lit, we meet an old friend, and it's just so brilliant how they keep this as a surprise.So poor characterisation aside, and some silly plot holes, it's a relief to say that it's a wonderful experience, and it exceeded my expectations.It has the trademark Spielberg sheen all over it. And if it does have a sense of déjà Vu regarding Spielberg's other blockbusters (Jaws gets riffed on when a woman is in peril in water), its good to know he had a lot of input, because after all, he's still the king of the summer blockbuster.",Jurassic World
36,phd_travel,Watchable leads and a well paced story,10,13 July 2015,"This movie is a leap forward for the series. If you think you've seen enough dinosaurs you'd be surprised by how fresh and exciting this blockbuster is. The story involves the escape of a genetically created hybrid dinosaur in a dinosaur theme park. The action is thrilling and isn't too dizzying, or too kiddie.The two leads Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt are more watchable than Jurassic Park's Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum. Bryce is an excellent expressive actress with a beautiful watchable face - she was the most convincing actress in ""The Help"" and it's great to see her back on the big screen. Chris is likable - not too over built to be unrealistic.The production is grand and attractive. The theme park is fun and the rides are the best version of a fantasy theme park come to life. The story has a good pace, you get to identify the different dinosaurs enough and get to know the humans like the two brothers well enough to be scared for them too.Well worth watching. It deserves the box office success it has had.",Jurassic World
37,Aaron1375,It was cool to finally see a fully functional park complete with tourists,8,22 June 2015,"This movie was a good film, lots of dinosaur action to be sure; however, I am a bit perplexed as to why this one is doing such astronomical business at the box office. While it was good, it really was not anything new...to me it was pretty much chock full of things we had already seen before with the exception of a cool working park that I kind of wish we got to see more of before the chaos ensued. Do not get me wrong the chaos was awesome and I guess that in the end is why it is doing so well. A kid is going to absolutely love a flick like this...I know I would have as a child. I just wish they had some more interesting human characters. Basically, I say bravo to the dinosaurs they did what they needed to. I just felt the human characters were a bit underwhelming, the poor dinosaurs had to take up to much slack.The story has us arriving at a fully functional dinosaur park. A couple of boys are going there to meet their aunt who is quite high up on the ladder in the park. She is so busy she pretty much pawns them off on a poor woman who really got a bit more done to her than she really deserved (I would have liked to see what happened to her, happen to D'Onofrio's character). Meanwhile, the aunt is pitching a new dinosaur as they want to wow the people so why not make a bigger more ferocious dinosaur. While this is going on, a man is attempting to train Raptors. He is asked to inspect this new dinosaur and it isn't too long before things get out of control and the new attraction is running rampant in the park! The dinosaurs are awesome and it was totally cool to see the one in the water. Not sure why they felt the need to make anything else as I would love to go to the park just to see that one in the water. The problem is other than Bryce Dallas Howard's character, no one else was really that good. Pratt was awesome in Guardians of the Galaxy did his best Mark Walhberg impersonation in this one. D'Onofrio was over the top annoying, the two kids weren't bad, but I thought the whole divorce subplot pointless. Only a very small number of the human's jokes worked for me, most felt flat. The human element just did not even compare to the dinosaur one. It was not terrible, just not great at all.Overall, the movie was good. The dinosaurs were awesome, the mayhem was awesome and the dinosaur fights were cool. I also applaud them for the amount of deaths they showed on screen. One of the things I hated about Lost World was that nearly every death was off screen while here we get to see em chomped! The movie could have been better if say Pratt was more like Guardians and less like a rock and some of the other characters were given more to work with, but the dinosaurs take up the slack and make this a very fun film.",Jurassic World
38,Wuchakk,Been there done that (and better too),6,23 August 2015,"I was interested in seeing ""Jurassic World"" (2015) because (1.) I love dinosaurs, (2.) I love island adventure and (3.) it's the third top-grossing film in cinematic history, as of this writing. I thought that it would be at least be as good as the first movie (1993), which – contrary to popular opinion -- I never felt was great because the story and characters were never that compelling. Yes, the dinosaurs were great and the t-rex and velociraptor sequences are exceptional, but most of the rest of the movie was average at best, even forgettable, although Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Ariana Richards were effective. Despite my criticisms, I gave the film a solid grade of ""B"" or 7/10 Stars.The second film (1997) and the third film (2001) were serviceable, but forgettable and somehow a letdown, which brings us to this fourth film in the series, a whopping fourteen years after the previous sequel. So how does it stack up? While ""Jurassic World"" is better than the two previous movies it's not as good as the first one. In fact, the plot's pretty much a retread with marginal changes. The big difference here is that it's 22 years later and the original Park is now a Disneyworld-like tourist attraction called Jurassic World owned by Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and ran by an all-business woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Chris Pratt plays the male protagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio the bad guy, Omar Sy the token black dude and BD Wong the token Asian scientist. Katie McGrath is on hand as the boy's hired quasi-nanny at the park, Zara, but she's not fleshed-out as a character; flesh-eaten maybe, but not fleshed out.Actually, that's the main problem with this movie. The characters have little depth, although Bryce shines as the preoccupied-with-work Aunt and Pratt has the gravitas for his role. Unfortunately, the two kids (brothers) are decidedly dull. My wife thought so as well, so it's not just me. The writers should've worked-in the older brother's girlfriend to spice things up or, at least, some other girl at the park.Nevertheless, there are a few effective sequences or concepts, like the Pterosaur attack on the tourists, the rousing Indominus/t-rex fight and the earlier revelation about the former.The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot mainly in Hawaii, but also California and Louisiana.GRADE: B-",Jurassic World
39,zetes,"Totally not bad sequel. I know it's not saying much, but it's the second best Jurassic Park movie, at least.",7,14 June 2015,"I set the bar for this one pretty low. My only hope was that it would be at least as good as Jurassic Park III, which, despite its reputation, is a perfectly decent sequel to the first one. Thankfully, it exceeded my expectations - at least by a bit. It is better than JP III by a nose, and a lot better than The Lost World. All I wanted was plenty of dino mayhem, and Colin Trevorrow delivers it with good humor. There are lots of dinosaurs and lots of action. Not a single setpiece as good as the big two from the first film, mind you, but the pterosaur attack is pretty awesome and the final battle is satisfying. The human characters are much less interesting than those of the first film, who aren't very interesting, either. Chris Pratt is a fine lead, though. I could really have done without Bryce Dallas Howard running around in her high heels. Even if she does get a big heroic moment, the character is just a lame stereotype for most of the film. The two teens could have easily been eaten the second they appeared and it wouldn't have bothered me. I enjoyed the presence of New Girl's Jake Johnson and Orange Is the New Black's Lauren Lapkus in the control room. There's a moment where Johnson looks at Pratt and in my mind he was asking Pratt off camera, ""You think in a couple years when my sitcom ends I could get a comic book franchise?""",Jurassic World
40,trashgang,can't beat Jurassic Park,6,17 July 2015,"It's been 22 years ago since the first Jurassic Park conquered the world and still being an excellent flick. A new generation of youth is ready to go back to the park and finally the much acclaimed Jurassic World is open to visit. I went to see the new breed of dinosaurs but wasn't shocked in what I saw.Going back 22 years it was stunning to see people walk amongst the first creatures who walked the earth. Even the story was great but nowadays those effects are seen in every movie. Just see what Godzilla did last year. So yes, on part of the effects it's all great but nothing new and the story isn't going to put you at the edge of your seat. This is exactly what it must do, no gore, no nudity, no shocking things, just a flick you watch with your whole family. Even if they are under 10 it's all watchable. And the story, well, it's what you've seen in the original one. Things go wrong at the park, and children have to be saved. The raptors are back again and their alpha is a human, can see coming from a stone age what they will do at the end. Predictable blockbuster to make the new youngsters at home warm to go back to the original flick(s). Pure entertainment.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",Jurassic World
41,mm-39,Better than the original,8,24 July 2015,"Jurassic World is better than the original. I found Jurassic World to be a remake of Jurassic Park. Personally I find remake to be either great or awful! What worked: Chris Pratt plays a non P C alpha male which is balanced with intellect and compassion. Bryce Dallas Howard female character balance with Pratt perfectly. The female-male have a sexual tension mixed with strong personalities which create a spicy relationship. The children characters were believable and did not run hurt Jurassic by running around screaming. There is a story about socialization, how male and female interact, how groups interact and animals with nature . One see how nature survives and a social balance is created. Jurassic worlds warnings about modified genetics with the modified Dino. The special effects where great and made for a breath taking rollercoster ride. What did not work. Michael Crichton movies are always the same what we invent turns on US. Crichton stories always have technology vs humans. Seen on Crichton movie seen them all. Eight out of ten.",Jurassic World
42,deloudelouvain,Predictable and boring story with boring actors. Nevertheless the dinos are great.,7,22 June 2015,"I'm giving Jurassic World a seven star rating purely based on the special effects that I really liked. The dinosaurs looked very real and that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this movie. For the rest the storyline is very lame and predictable. From the beginning I had an allergic reaction to that little kid Gray (played by Ty Simpkins). You wish the whole time he will die in the most atrocious way possible. But you know it will never happen. I hope that one day he will play in Game Of Thrones because there all the main characters die eventually and that's what makes it so much better then those predictable movies. That kid is one of the main reasons I will never have kids. What an annoying kid he was. Another guy that I don't really like is Chris Pratt. In Parks and Recreation he was the only character that really bothered me. And since I know he is an avid hunter and Jesus worshiper I can stand him even lesser. I was also hoping he would die, but you know it won't happen. Bad acting doesn't make you die when you are the so called hero in those movies. All in all you will like the movie for the dinos but don't expect anything from the story.",Jurassic World

At least, it did for me, and I was watching it on the small screen. But I guess I have nothing great to say about it either? Almost none of the characters are memorable (think ""The Lost World""), which allows Chris Pratt to easily steal the movie. So if he's your thing, then settle in. But look, Jurassic Park hasn't been great since the first one, and this movie rides that nostalgia to the very end.

The evil corporation, the arrogant rich man, the uncaring secretary and the opportunist need all be punished for their sins. Not so the sexy redhead who got everybody killed in the first place or the annoying children who do whatever they feel like it while a killer dino is on the loose . God, not the children!This sums up the plot of the film. There is absolutely no recipe for a quick buck that was not used in the movie and the rest, which is just as formulaic, is just special effects and a weird hybrid (see what I did there?) between Jurassic Park and Godzilla.

46,StevePulaski,A world of predators and we are the prey,7,13 June 2015,"A fourth installment of the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise has long been in the works, and if nothing else, its assembly at least gives this new generation something to warmly embrace that doesn't find itself cloaked in candy colors and Marvel branding. On my way to the theater, I kept trying to think of what I exactly wanted ""Jurassic World"" to accomplish as a film, and it didn't take long to realize that I was over-analyzing a lot of my expectations. The only thing I wanted was the element of wonder and danger that was missing in the third installment, but heavily present in the first and underrated second film.On that note, ""Jurassic World"" delivers quite a bit of suspense and exhilaration. I would even say it goes far beyond the thrill and intensity factor of the original film with what it chooses to show. There's much more blood and violence than in any of the previous films, and the special effects are some of the strongest the series has ever seen. Aside from occasionally appearing to be a Samsung sponsored commodity with the heavy emphasis on product placement, in addition to elements that almost seem like self-parody for a summer blockbuster, this is only one of the many summer blockbusters we've been spoiled to so early in the season.Our setting is Jurassic World, a monstrous theme park housing real-life dinosaurs, some of which genetically modified, that provides the thrills and excitements of living with dinosaurs. We immediately focus on Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins), two young boys who venture out to Jurassic World to visit their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the park. Claire, however, is busy trying to attract financiers to see the park's new ""Indominus Rex,"" one of the genetically modified dinosaurs that combines eight different species of animal to, in turn, create a humongous dinosaur.The park's main dinosaur trainer is Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), an ex-Navy member, who immediately works to help after a catastrophic turn of events has Indominus Rex leaving his concubine, wreaking havoc on the park. Numerous failed attempts to cage and detain the beast eventually result in several other dinosaurs being let out of their cages, causing for a complete meltdown of the entire facility. Despite lacking in proper artillery and being responsible for hundreds of thousands of lives, Owen and Claire work together to try and stop the beasts from terrorizing the park.The original ""Jurassic Park"" worked so well because of its emphasis on peril. The film put you into a barrage of situations that felt like you were at the mercy of the same large, hulking beasts the characters on-screen were running from. ""Jurassic World"" restores that element, constantly trapping the viewer in an awkward or frightening position, with Colin Trevorrow commanding controlled but large-scale direction at all times. This is the essence of why ""Jurassic World"" is such a thrill; it plunges us into many different scenarios and gives us a variety of evocative landscapes and dinosaurs to feast our eyes on at all times.Through starring roles in some of Hollywood's loftiest and most expensive productions, Pratt has finally asserted his ability to command a presence. If ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" didn't convince you that he wasn't on top of his game, ""Jurassic World"" will be that deciding factor. He has the subtle, suave goofiness that doesn't make him bumbling and incompetent and the right amount of intelligence as a character actor to be taken seriously, and he rises to the occasion with this picture at every turn. His character is actually so interesting that it makes focusing on the two young boys feel like a burdened change in direction, mainly because Robinson's character is such a moody, unlikable teenager.In itself, ""Jurassic World""'s burdens come in the form of excessive product placement, to the point where if Starbucks or Samsung isn't being shoved down our face, it's Coca-Cola or Beats by Dre. Some don't pick up on product placement as easily as others, but when we're immersed in a theme park setting like this, which is predominately wilderness as is, these sorts of things are much easier to spot, especially when it seems that Trevorrow is trying to make sure that said product is always at eye-level with the audience when it's in frame. Furthermore, there's the obvious element of events occurring to the characters' advantage just in the nick of time, which, while common for the summer blockbuster genre, is nonetheless cloying and overly obvious. We've already been asked to suspend our disbelief for dinosaurs, so scenes like a dead Pterodactyl's beak coming dangerously close to one of the young boys' faces before slowing to a halt feels like a cheap shot at suspense and convenience.These burdens, however, do not discourage the fun ""Jurassic World"" brings. Few franchises from yesteryear that are revisited in the modern day have the ability to excite, but just hearing the name ""Jurassic Park"" brings to mind a multitude of different visuals that capture the imagination. ""Jurassic World"" is a testament to the imagination and proves, yet again, that even franchises that have laid dormant for several years can still get off the ground and morph into something worth watching.",Jurassic World
47,DKosty123,Highest Octane Entry of the Series - Rebooted,7,16 June 2015,"This entry does so some liberal set borrowing from earlier films. The upgraded CGI is pretty sharp and the action is faster and more vast. This entry is better than the third entry because the director got away from cloning Spielburg which is why the last one was so terrible. A must see? Maybe not but the length is right and it gives the viewer their money worth.No one from the original cast is in this one but that does not matter as even though the plot has a feel of the earlier films and references to those films, this film stands on it's own. It has some really wild action as it begins to look like the entire world is out of control.The story feels like previous films and the 3 D is sharp. The kids in this one are actually a little older and not as cute. The original message is still here- you can not trust corporations to do things right for this world and they tend to screw up things when they get too ambitious. The Reps and Dems could take a lesson from this moral, as the free traders there have gotten like InGen, too big for their britches. Jimmy Fallon makes a cameo appearance in this one. After a raptor nearly snacks on Jimmy, he is gone quickly.",Jurassic World
48,lasttimeisaw,Nostalgia wins!,7,19 June 2015,"I am on my vacation in Croatia, but cannot resist the temptation to visit a local multiplex and watch this box-office record-shattering blockbuster, now has officially revitalised the JURASSIC PARK franchise, it brings back the nostalgic audience who has welcomed and impressed by the first tent-pole came out exactly 22 years ago with umpteen salutes, and competently revamps the visual spectacle to win over new audience. Director Colin Trevorrow and his team has accomplished a quite impressive job! It is basically the same old story, only the scale is proportionally swollen, now Jurassic Park is a fully operating theme park, and our antagonist here is a genetically mutated creature, Indominus Rex (not a dinosaur in the traditional sense, as its DNA carries more undisclosed samples from other species), who is smart enough to trick its human creators and runs amok, wreaks havoc on both human visitors and dinosaur habitants on the island of Isla Nublar. The park's operational manager Claire (Howard) teams up with Owen (Pratt), a veteran now is a raptor trainer on the island, to find Gray (Simpkins) and Zack (Robinson), Claire's nephews who are entrapped in the dangerous zone, and bring them back to safe places. Meanwhile, Hoskins (D'Onofrio), the head of security, thinks it is a great opportunity for a field test of the trained raptors, as he intends to use them in military uses. Under the commander of Owen, four trained raptors are released to track Indominus, but the scheme backfires as soon as they realise the latter contains the former's DNA too. The prolonged survival battle will need the old ruler of the food chain to settle the scores. Chris Pratt is presently the mascot of North American box-office, his down-to-earth persona and his respectful attitude towards dinosaurs attainably confronts Bryce Dallas Howard's high-maintenance facade and her commodity view on the genetically created behemoths, their clashes are metered out with beguiling charm to appease the lowest common denominator, as the latter can literally outrun a T-Rex in her high-heels, and generously the film grants her a trans-formative curve to be connected to the living things and her nephews. Ty Simpkins, who has stolen the thunder from Robert Downey Jr. in IRON MAN 3 (2013), again here he is utterly adorable and conspicuously heartwarming in a role doesn't expect to demand too much other than screaming and running! Irrfan Khan, as the owner of the entire enterprise, Masrani, stands out in his caricature of a man whose leisured passion eventually becomes his doom.The SFX is in its full-blown fashion as we can get a glimpse in the trailer, it aspiringly offers more leeway for the interaction between visitors and its permanent residents, like the ""gyrosphere"" experience and the mosasaurus splash. However, as Indominus is the only villain most of the time, its ubiquitous presence, does feel too contrived, which later can be also referred to the ""betrayed"" raptors, as viewers have the full knowledge of how enormous the island is. It certainly tones down the sense of ""epic-ness"" one might expect from such a ginormous project. Otherwise, JURASSIC WORLD hits all the right notes, massively enhanced by Michael Giacchino's golden accompanying score, as a studio product tries to parade its most generic appeal to lure as many as audience possible, and nothing is wrong of that, as long as viewers can identify with some respect has been thoroughly taken into considerations during the production line.",Jurassic World

This was still a super fun filled, exciting ride from start to finish. If you are going to watch this movie, I highly recommend you check it out in 4D. The story interwoven with the action scenes is done pretty well and the bickering between characters wasn't all that annoying either. It compacted a lot of cool elements in this movie, it's like they threw everything they got for this production. It even has an Asian Stever Jobs in this film. Just when you think it couldn't get anymore cooler, they throw in something ridiculous but exciting surprise at the audiences. The special effects are top notch in this, and it really shows how much innovation when it came to the CGI it has come compared to the first film in this franchise. Yeah, this seems more like a monster movie than a dinosaur crisis movie, but it has enough exciting and tension like sequences to the point it really doesn't matter all that much. Maybe it's because I saw this film in 4D, but I enjoyed this film way more than I thought I would.8/10",Jurassic World
51,OllieSuave-007,Adrenaline-pumping Jurassic sequel.,8,22 June 2015,"Jurassic World is set 22 years after the events of the original Jurassic Park movie, where Isla Nublar is now a fully functioning theme park with dinosaurs, running successfully for over a decade. To boost attendance, the park has created a hybrid dinosaur as their new attraction. However, the creation yielded unintended and horrific consequences.The movie starts off a little slow, with scenes of brothers Zach and Gray's trip to the dinosaur theme park cutting back and forth to scenes of the scientists and park owners jabbering about corporate sponsors. But, the movie picks up steam when the Velociraptors were introduced, being trained by researcher Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). This leads to scenes of the various dinosaurs at the park through the brothers' point of view, with John Williams' original theme soundtrack playing in the background, which instantly brings back memories and nostalgia of the first movie. This was a very touching and clever touch that lets the viewers see a panorama of the entire park while connecting the story to the events of the first film.The introduction of the hybrid dinosaur leads to the film's highlighted excitement and suspense, creating tension and thrills when it escapes and threatens to wreck havoc on the park with its thousands of visitors ambiguous to the threat. What results is one adrenaline-pumping scene after the other from start to finish.The film may not be as good as the first one and the story could have focused more on the initial success and operation of the park and connect John Hammond's vision from the first movie more. However, I thought it's good that, in addition to the dinosaur mayhem, the movie also focuses more on the character development such as the on and off relationship between Owen and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) and the bond between brothers Zach and Ty. It also gives a little more attention to the dinosaurs, as we are asked to sympathize with the injured Brontosaurus and to understand the Velociraptors' connection with their trainer. The acting was decent for the most part, with Pratt and Howard delivering some spot-on performances in their roles. There is also some humor in the movie, though I thought some were forced and were pretty cheesy. The special effects were also decent - not as sophisticated as in the first movie, but it's good that the filmmakers used some animatronics rather than relying solely on CGI. The music score was catchy and am glad John William's theme was incorporated, and the direction was well-paced.Overall, it's a fun and entertaining sci-fi adventure that does well as a Jurassic sequel.Grade B+",Jurassic World
52,Hellmant,"Any animal lover, like myself, will definitely love this film!",9,15 June 2015,"'JURASSIC WORLD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fourth installment in the blockbuster monster flick series 'JURASSIC PARK'; which director Steven Spielberg began in 1993 (he serves as an executive producer on this movie). Successful indie filmmaker Colin Trevorrow (who also directed the 2012 quirky time traveling comedy flick 'SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED') directed and co- wrote the movie (Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Derek Connolly also worked on the screenplay). It stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Robinson, Ty Simpkins, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Omar Sy, Jake Johnson (who also co-starred in 'SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED') and BD Wong (the only returning cast member from the original film). The story is set 22 years after the original movie, on the same island, where a new Jurassic park has been successfully operating for ten years. When scientists decide to create a new breed of dinosaur, in order to boost declining sales, things once again go disastrously wrong. The film had the biggest opening weekend of all time, making over $500 million worldwide (which is an industry first). It may not be the greatest film of all time, but it is a fun movie!Jurassic World has been a successful theme park for 10 years, but sales are starting to decline. It's up to operations manager, Claire Dearing (Howard), to boost profits again. The company's owner, and CEO, Simon Masrani (Khan), has asked the genetic scientists, working for him, to create a new breed of dinosaur; to attract more tourists. The new monster they've created isn't really a dinosaur though, and it quickly figures out a way to escape it's confinements, and wreak havoc on the park (and it's guests). Claire enlists the help of an expert Velociraptor trainer, named Owen Grady (that she once dated), to help stop the 'indominus' creature.The film is full of a lot of great monster fights and violent attacks on tourists; it's got all of the thrills, and gore, that fans are looking for. Once again the human characters aren't as interesting. Bryce Dallas Howard is really good in the lead though, which is by far the most developed character, and she actually gives one of her best performances. Chris Pratt is really funny, and very likable, as the action hero lead (and I definitely agree with all the Harrison Ford comparisons). I also really like his relationship with the Velciraptors (which is my favorite part of the movie). I think any animal lover, like myself, will definitely love this film. It's not as good as Spielberg's classic original, of course, but it is the best of the sequels and a really entertaining movie!Watch our movie review show at: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=zfYb1KqmKxo",Jurassic World
53,Buddy-51,Basically a technically accomplished rehash of the original film,6,2 June 2016,"The characters in ""Jurassic World"" - which should be titled ""Will Humans Never Learn?"" - keep telling one another that the paying public needs ever more elaborate sensations to keep them coming back for more. Yet, it's hard at times to tell whether they're talking about the audiences at the park or the audiences for the movie.This little bit of self-reflective self-awareness on the part of the filmmakers is one of the few interesting things about this fourth entry in a tetralogy that began with the groundbreaking ""Jurassic Park"" in 1993. The problem is that it's hard to break ground more than once in the same soil, and ""Jurassic World"" finds no real way to bring anything new to the project.The movie just keeps playing different variations on the same theme. Thus, instead of ""mere"" (and, now, apparently passé) full-sized dinosaurs being regenerated out of ancient samples of preserved DNA, we've graduated to ""super dinosaurs"" being genetically-engineered out of a mixture of all sorts of dino types. All this gene- and species-tampering is taking place at a decade-old amusement park, an improvement, we are told, over the ill-fated one that never quite got off the ground in the 1990s. But humans are humans and playing God, especially for sensation and profit, never ends very well in these sorts of scenarios, so we're primed to buckle our seats and hang on for the ride. We aren't disappointed.Once we get past that one slight deviation, the plot of ""Jurassic World"" pretty much replicates the 1993 original, right down to the ""unlikely"" (though, actually, quite predictable) system malfunction and two lost and imperiled kids having to be saved from becoming Dino-food by an intrepid adult at the park (Chris Pratt plays the role of trainer and dinosaur- whisperer here). In fact, virtually every scene in ""Jurassic World"" has a corresponding counterpart in ""Jurassic Park,"" only what was once innovative and fresh has now become derivative and stale (apparently, none of the characters here ever seen the original ""Jurassic Park"" or they wouldn't keep making the exact same mistakes as the previous group).Pratt has an easygoing, good-ole-boy charm that serves him well in his role as makeshift hero, but Bryce Dallas Howard is given the thankless task of playing a rather insultingly sexist caricature as the manager of the park who's in way over her head when it comes to running the joint, not to mention coping with a crisis of this magnitude (think Kate Capshaw in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") and is, thus, in constant need of rescuing by the stalwart Pratt.Under the directorial aegis of Colin Trevorrow, the action scenes and special effects are predictably eye-popping and state-of-the-art - helping to generate the ""wow factor"" one minimally expects from this series - but the overall air of deja vu that permeates the film keeps this latest dino-blockbuster from being much more than an afterthought in the Jurassic universe.",Jurassic World
54,thesar-2,"Come to see Dinos fight, but not the World",6,14 June 2015,"Basically, everything you'd want to see in a Jurassic sequel, or correcting all they got wrong with parts 2-3, is here. That's really it, but not to downplay it, those scenes were EXECELLENT, specifically the special effects and dinosaur attacks. Not to give any away, but the climatic final battle is one of the best I've seen. And even though everything in that third act is as predictable as a Nicholas Sparks movie (actually, everything here is,) I definitely wanted all that to happen. Additionally, the throwback scene to the original, including the accompanying score, was pretty darn cool. And finally, while I've been a fan of Chris Pratt since Parks & Rec, I was so pleased he stepped out of his smart aleck, goofy roll he's played in practically everything and played a pretty good character. As much as I like him, I was originally dreading him not acting outside the box in this, much like 90% of Melissa McCarthy's career. Luckily he proved himself – now bring on (or back?) Indy!That all said, Jurassic World was far from perfect – even though it beat the hell out of The Lost World and the horrendous Part III. The movie dragged a lot with uninteresting subplots – oh, no divorce again!, a dick of a kid (the older brother) I wanted to punch in the throat and a wasted opportunity, especially with the title, on just rehashing the same old formula with incredibly bad decisions made on an island. Literally nothing is new here. And that's sad, especially since this will make a lot and lo, we'll be back on another island for the inevitable part V. Overall, the good way outweighed the bad, and is highly recommended for fans of the first one. The special effects, dino-scenes, BIRDS ATTACK! and the end battle were worth it alone.",Jurassic World
55,cherold,"Exciting, and more consistently entertaining than the original, though less subtle",8,14 November 2015,"Jurassic Park was a terrific movie once it got going, but people comparing it with the Jurassic World reboot seem to have forgotten the tedious, soap-operish story that dragged down the original. JP followed a pattern I always associate with The Birds; throw us into the tedious entanglements of uninteresting people until we're almost asleep, then start the mayhem. There is very little soap opera in Jurassic World, and most of that comes in brief spurts later in the movie. The film begins by establishing how incredibly cool Jurassic World actually is, with charming scenes at a dinosaur petting zoo and a dramatic giant-fish feeding that made me feel like I would really, really like to go there. One also sees where things are going to go awry, although the score never telegraphs those moments, sounding perpetually chipper even when you're thinking, that's not going to turn out well.While JW doesn't subject viewers to the degree of pure tedium that JP did, it's still a movie that doesn't really take off until things go wrong. Once they do, the movie becomes a series of big, wild dinosaur disasters that keep getting bigger as more and more people die. While this is exciting, by the end it feels as though the movie is a bit too focused on making things big. JW has a lot of excitement, but the original JP had more suspense. JP was a movie that understood waiting for the right moment; JW believes the moment is RIGHT NOW.There's also some sort of story with Chris Pratt as the guy with sense and a bunch of other people without any, including a greedy owner, a military guy whose ideas are so ridiculously poorly thought out that even a cartoon villain would say, ""maybe you should take a minute to think this through,"" and an executive who gets to run around the jungle in high heels. Her character has been called sexist, and I can see why, but I would say that this comes as much out of a lazy reliance on character clichés than anything else. But what I like about this movie over JP is that it has far less interest in its characters. It knows that all anyone cares about are the dinosaurs, and it delivers those beautifully.",Jurassic World
56,FeastMode,entertaining,8,26 June 2019,"Super zalama. intense and entertaining throughout. i loved how much more they were able to do with better technology and endless funds. the dinosaurs looked awesome and a lot more detailed, with a lot more species and variations of each. great job exploring more possibilities of where this idea could be taken. lots of great unique memorable scenes done creatively. good cast. lots of funny parts but some jokes that flopped.on 4th viewing, this movie is still entertaining but feels more throw-away than i originally felt. i thought about dropping to a 7.

not all characters were deep, but one that surprisingly was, was the indominus rex. it had a great psychological aspect to it. also with the Raptors whether they would be loyal to their species or their friends, like the nature vs nurture argument. the final battle was absolutely phenomenal and amazingly directed.

57,Robert_duder,The Epic Juggernaut returns but without some of the magic,7,7 July 2015,"2015 is actually a HUGE year for movies. Some of my most anticipated films are hitting theatres or have already hit and this was one of them. Jurassic Park was one of the films that gave me my adoration for movies. It took a casual fun thing and turned it into an obsession for me. The dark theatre, the stunning special effects, that amazing body-tingling score, and the terror of being trapped in a park with dinosaurs. Jurassic Park is easily one of the ten best films ever made in my books. The two sequels were also decent (I don't care what anyone says)...I actually think Jurassic World is lowest in the series. That's not to say it isn't entertaining and I was thrilled to experience the world again. The biggest problem is that Jurassic World is a sequel that presents itself like a remake. Many of the scenes feel carbon-copied from the original (which would be okay if this were a remake.) It doesn't have nearly the intensity or thrill that the original had and it isn't even as dark as the original was. It just feels like it is lacking some of the magic from the original and like rather than setting itself apart, it is simply building and borrowing from the original. I also think the film lacked greatly by having none of the original cast return. I felt like I was aching to see Dr. Sadler, Malcolm, Lexi, Tim...anyone from the original.Despite that, the new young cast was very good. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson were both quite good in the role of brothers brought to the island to spend time with their Aunt. Neither one of them had the sheer terror and naivety that the original kids had but they definitely hold their own in the film. The adult cast was really lacking in my books. I'm not sure I fully understand the sudden instead stardom of Chris Pratt. He is decent and I like him but I don't think he has the chemistry of big stars of movies past. He is good in this but is he the ultimate hero? Do we care about him that way we did about Dr. Grant in the original? Is he almost too invulnerable? There was just something not quite right about him. Still everyone loves the guy and he is Hollywood gold right now. I've always been very ho-hum about Bryce Dallas Howard since The Village. I feel like she overacts and really tries too hard. This sort of role demonstrates that very well. She is aggressive and unlikable and the romance between her and Pratt is literally forced down our throats. She is not right for the film and she sort of drags it down significantly. Vincent D'Onofrio is perfect as the villain of sorts. D'Onofrio has that character actor quality that really makes him great. Irrfan Khan was also fantastic in a horribly small role that should have been far more significant. Jake Johnson also plays a great role that is too small and BD Wong returns as the only returning cast member in a character that is completely changed from the original bit part he had in the first film.Now I know this film is shaping up to be one of the biggest of all time so who am I to say anything bad about it. But how on earth do you hand one of the biggest franchises of all time into the hands of a completely inexperienced director? Colin Treverrow is a viral success that somehow gets this put on his plate. Now his flagship film was one of my favourite of 2012 (Safety Not Guaranteed) but this is a different ball of wax entirely. The film lacks that must-have epic Jurassic Park feel and some of that has to be because of his inexperience. That body-shivering score I mentioned is hardly used which also hurts the experience. Maybe Jurassic World isn't for me or for my generation that grew up with the original but rather a new generation and maybe they (obviously) love it. I'm glad I got to revisit the franchise and I will be back for more but lovers of the original will certainly find plenty to be disappointed with. The return of the original T-Rex was easily the best part of the film and the special effects were handled very well and its a fun time at the movies so I will give it points for that. 7.5/10",Jurassic World
58,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Satisfactory in what it aims to be, but still leaves you with the feeling of being a missed opportunity",7,19 July 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) are two siblings who have been sent away for a holiday to the Jurassic World theme park by their over-bearing mother, trying to divert their minds from the divorce that's brewing between her and their father. Meanwhile, on the island resort, Claire (Bruce Dallas Howard), the boy's aunt and senior management figure, has to present the new, genetically created super-monster to some potential investors. To oversee it's behaviour, she selects old flame Owen (Chris Pratt), whose rough, renegade style will have it's ups and downs. But the new super dinosaur has a mind of it's own, and has plans to break free from captivity and wreak havoc on the island.Anyone over the age of thirty is likely to have the original Jurassic Park moulded in to their minds in some way. Even if they never saw the film, the sheer amount of publicity and merchandise it attracted would keep it engraved in their minds. As such, Jurassic World, the spin off film of the series, is serving much the same function as The Phantom Menace did in 1999, for those for whom Star Wars was the film from their youth (and who are over the age of forty!) It's not a heartless, soulless spin off, like many that fall from the Hollywood cookie cutter machine these days, and there is spark and potential in the script, but sadly, while this is evident, it just doesn't manage to really be the sum of it's parts.The idea of Jurassic Park having become a theme park for tourists, with tacky souvenir shops and franchise establishments everywhere, and having the dinosaurs as modern day animals in a modern day zoo ('kids get bored just staring at a stegosaurus these days...' as the Claire character comments at the beginning) is an interesting one, and has the potential to serve as a really good set up. But for some reason, the story moves away from this, and has some disjointed narratives serving as the plot, flitting from Pratt and Howard trying to bring the escaped animals down, to the two boys trying to stay out of harm's way, through to Irrfan Khan and BD Wong fighting for control as the situation worsens. Pratt is the new go to man for this kind of thing, and he is strong and solid in his role here, although Simpkins and Robinson are a pretty cardboard copy of the kids from the first film.Visually, of course, the film is far from a disappointment. The dinosaur designs and effects are even more astonishing than they were twenty years ago, and are a breath-taking spectacle as we watch them battle on the island. Director Colin Trevorrow has managed to stick true to this aspect of what made the original so memorable, but has just failed to serve it with a stronger script or coherent narrative. It basically serves it's purpose, and can't really be called a let down in any way, just something that could have been a little more. ***",Jurassic World
59,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Tries to recreate a classic but only takes its most surface of elements; in the end, it just feels like filler.",4,10 June 2018,"'Jurassic World (2015)' apes the most surface-level aspects of the franchise's first entry without ever recreating what made that film so special. It almost entirely omits the themes that make the concept itself interesting and it misses out on any engaging characters, through which we should be viewing these extraordinary events in order to actually care about them. It also manages to totally overload the original trilogy's computer-to-practical ratio, losing out on all components that could make its, admittedly sometimes impressive, visual effects seem truly believable. The CG always feels exactly as such and doesn't become an extension of the story or world, unable to elicit the wonder or fear it once did with ease twenty-five years ago. It doesn't help that most of the narrative is essentially nonsensical and every few moments there's something to roll your eyes at. Plot points provoke pained sighs as opposed to a widening of the eyes, and the exposition is so blatant that it's a wonder why you're shown anything at all. It gets to a point where you realise that the filmmakers don't trust you to understand their narrative and so tell you everything at least twice, even when it's right there on screen. The movie is more interested in showing you dinosaurs dealing out damage to one another than anything else, with the suspense the series is known for at perhaps its least prominent. It really is the lack of character, despite the many core players (who all consistently make unintelligent and unbelievable decisions, by the way), that puts the final nail in the coffin of this technologically advanced but entirely less believable sequel, though. It just goes to show you that the script is the most important thing, everything else is just filler. Filler is exactly what this feels like. 4/10",Jurassic World
60,ThomasDrufke,Welcome Back,7,14 June 2015,"People who say that nothing is original in Hollywood have an argument. I mean we live in a world where Vacation, Ben Hur, Mad Max, and Jurassic Park are all getting remade, re-quels, or long overdue sequels. There aren't many studios who pull the trigger on an unknown property, so here we have Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to the previous films, but more so just a film that calls back to the original but ignores the events of the next two. Is it better than the original? No, probably not. But it's definitely not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I really enjoyed the film. I know some people will still take issue with the fact that there's no reason there even should have been more than one film. Why are people still making dinosaurs? It's a good question. But if you just look at the film as more of a monster movie and not compared to the original classic, I think you will have a good time.Set 22 years after the events of the original, Jurassic World has the island as a full time theme park, just as John Hammond had hoped. But as people are growing tired of seeing dinosaurs, scientists create a new hybrid dinosaur as a way to boost attendance. Chris Pratt stars as a Velociraptor trainer, while Bryce Dallas Howard stars as one of the heads of the theme park. There's a lot to like about the film. Pratt is a true movie star and the films action was actually better than I expected. There's also several nods and callbacks to the original film. But I think the film suffers in it's lack of unpredictability and even in the lack of animatronics. The old films used real props in close up shots and only used CGI when needed. I just feel like at times it felt like there was an abundance of CGI where there didn't need to be. And as cool as the final fight was with the new dinosaur, I would have liked to have seen more of the genetics side of the story. I feel like that side of the film was glazed over within a few minutes.But the film is beautiful. It's fascinating seeing the island as an actual theme park attraction just as Hammonds vision called for. Hearing John Williams vivacious score (now done by Michael Giacchino) as a backbone to the gorgeous scenery is an added bonus. I also love the idea that people are getting bored of seeing dinosaurs. I mean they're frickin dinosaurs! The film also gives us some great humor as well, but not as much from Chris Pratt as you would think. But Jake Johnson perhaps has the most memorable performance, playing the Samuel L. Jackson-esque character from the original. But we watch these films to be entertained. And Jurassic World definitely entertains. Maybe not as much of the immense tension that the original had, but the dino-fights are top notch and ended with a fantastic climax. Yes, the people who you think die, die. But the film is loaded high octane thrills and enough humor to keep your eyes pealed. I could have done without the clichéd romance and even the predictable kids side story. But I wasn't let down with Jurassic World.+Great finale +Pratt and Johnson's humor +Beautiful landscape & score+Fresh enough idea to feel necessary -Cliched romance -Too much CGI7.6/10",Jurassic World

Some of the storylines seem forced, and the dinosaur effects aren't any better than they were in 1993. Nevertheless, I'm glad they finally made a sequel to Jurassic Park. Yes, it would have been foolish of them to make any sort of ridiculous sequels with gymnastics or talking raptors.",Jurassic World
63,lesleyharris30,"Great Potential for a New Franchise, but has a lot to Improve upon,",7,16 June 2015,"Jurassic World is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast. It's a very enjoyable fourth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, the effects are amazing and there are some great intense scenes that will keep you at the edge of your seat, the two leads, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, are very likable and the chemistry between them is superb, if the studio orders sequels, which I'm sure they will, they need to return. I enjoyed the movie but it certainly had a lot of flaws, I think it's better than the Lost World and Jurassic Park III, but it was certainly the most predictable in the franchise, you could easily tell what characters were going to die and which would survive, and there are a few ""twists and turns"" that were very expected, the film seemed afraid to take any risks and do something that would differentiate itself from the previous movies, which is never a good thing for a sequel to do, it should have wanted to stand out more. The story tends to drag as well, running for over two hours, it really should have only been 100 minutes, no longer than that, there is way too much build up for the main story to finally happen that it leaves you bored at times, I think Jurassic World has some great potential to be a terrific new franchise, but they have many things they need to improve upon before they can move forward, and if they could get Spielberg back on the directors chair, even better. It has many imperfections and fans of the original Jurassic Park won't be thrilled, but Jurassic World is still a fun ride that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good adventure or action film. The original dinosaur theme park that was envisioned by John Hammond is now a reality, however, a new attraction designed to bring back people's interest begins to backfire horribly.

65,cosmo_tiger,A rare sequel that has a ton of hype behind it that isn't a total disappointment. I really enjoyed this.,8,29 June 2015,"""A whole new frontier has opened up. We have our first genetically modified hybrid."" Twenty-two years after the Jurassic Park tragedy the bugs have been worked out and the park has finally opened. Things are going great until attendance begins to drop. Wanting to make things exciting again the geneticists have created a new type of dinosaur. Once again the lesson of 22 years ago is forgotten, man shouldn't tamper with nature. I have been a huge fan of this series since I saw the first one in theaters. They are movies that are exciting to watch over and over. This one is no exception. The story of this one is almost secondary to the action, but it works. The movie is tense and exciting the entire time. Nothing is more exciting than seeing dinosaurs interacting with people and it really makes me want to visit a park like thisas long as the events that take place are different. If I had to knock the movie for anything it would be the same problem I had with the Star Wars prequels and Maleficent. When you watch the original movies Darth Vader and Maleficent are evil and scary but the new ones humanize them and make you look at them in a different light, this takes away from the originals for me. The same thing occurs in this movie in regards to some dinosaurs. That however is a very minor complaint and isn't worth skipping this over. Overall, a rare sequel that has a ton of hype behind it that isn't a total disappointment. I really enjoyed this. I give this an A-.",Jurassic World
66,callanvass,"Sometimes, nostalgia isn't all it's cracked up to be.",6,18 June 2015,"I enjoyed Jurassic Park a lot. I wasn't a massive fan or anything like that, but it was somewhat of a groundbreaking film. The sequels were pretty crappy, but I don't really remember them. My expectations for this movie were very low. I wasn't against another Jurassic Park movie by any means, but I wasn't exactly clamoring for one either. When my friend asked me to see it with him, I figured I'd give it a shot. It was technically well-done. It looked really slick. That being said, there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on. Then it dawned on me! It lacks genuine tension. Steven Spielberg is a master at creating thrills and tension. He knows what the audience wants. Colin Trevorrow obviously did some research. In many ways, this is like a love letter to Jurassic Park. There are a lot of references to Jurassic Park. As amiable as that is, he falls short. There is plenty of action, but it felt mechanical and I wasn't all that entertained by it. I will say the Dinosaurs looked pretty cool. The performances are above average. Chris Pratt handled himself adequately. I didn't think he was great, but he did the job. I didn't fully buy him as a ""tough guy"" Bryce Dallas Howard is a cute and fared pretty well. It's too bad her character was thinly written. Robinson & Simpkins are decent as the kids. My main problem with the cast is the lack of depth. I wasn't given enough to work with. This film isn't worthy of breaking box office records. I'm still shaking my head about how this made over 200 million on opening weekend. It's never boring and there are some good moments, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. It could have been better.6.3/10",Jurassic World
67,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,19 October 2015,"Jurassic WorldThe great thing about Jurassic World is that the vegetarian dinosaurs have all been transferred to Euro Jurassic World.In fact, the carnivorous reptilians populating this sci-fi adventure are designed to be even more ravenous.With attendance waning, scientists at a living dinosaur destination use DNA from predatory dinosaurs to conceive a genetically altered apex predator to bring the crowds back to the remote island resort.But when the hungry hybrid escapes its confines, the park's operations manager (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her visiting nephews (Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson) must rely on the resident Velociraptor wrangler (Chris Pratt) to outwit their astute stalker.A return to form for the dormant DNA tampering franchise, what Jurassic World lacks in plot, character development and plausibility, it makes up for in rapid pacing, salient visual effects and nonstop thrills.Incidentally, Jurassic World's main competition will always be that genetically modified Creationist theme park.

68,851222,Highly entertaining and a true sequel to the original,9,27 September 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.After my next words i do believe i will be stricken by a lightning but still here it goes - ""Jurassic World"" (2015) is THE most entertaining ""Jurassic"" movie YET. Before you starting to throw rocks at me, here is the only reason why i think this movie is the best in the series (including the original) - simply because it is superbly entertaining.The first film had a groundbreaking special effects, and the first hour or so was amazing, but when the shix hit the fan, it wasn't so exciting anymore. I always believed the human characters were weak in the first movie, although actors and acting were very solid, somehow for me second part of the movie was simply boring. Yes. Second movie was the worst Steven Spielberg's movie yet, even Steven Spielberg have admit it. The third was OK, better then 2nd by a mile. That said, ""Jurassic World"" should have been the true sequel to the original. It is bigger, louder and more entertaining - everything that a good sequel must have. Special effects in here are truly special, i don't see any movie this year who could steal the best special effects Oscar from ""Jurassic World"" - they aren't groundbreaking, but they are truly spectacular. Acting was very cool, as well as cinematography and very solid directing. Now i kinda see why this guy will helm one of the new ""Star Wars"" movies, which about i was skeptical before seeing ""Jurassic World"". Overall, ""Jurassic World"" is a highly entertaining movie. Best of all is to see it with friends on the biggest screen possible, it is a helluva entrainment, not a perfect one, but the best from this franchise yet.",Jurassic World
69,tabuno,Derivative But OK,7,14 January 2019,"16 June 2015. This movie seems to be a fusion of a monster disaster movie, typical of King Kong (2005) that has the beautiful, helpless lady sprawled on the ground with her skirt hiked up. The creation of the new dinosaur and the questions it raises might the singular most intellectually intriguing for this mostly predictable, mind-numbing and questionable logically flawed movie. There are so many scenes that just seem to be connected with so many coincidences as simply a lazy script device to keep the pacing and excitement going regardless. The visuals are decent for now and will eventually be improved upon in the future. The sound effects effective. There are number of relational and character moments of merit but mostly underdeveloped or never fully developed. Irrfan Khan's character had the most stimulating and interesting character (the new tycoon owner) that was never truly met the exciting character that he would have been developed into. I was waiting for the older boy's interest in attractive girls to be developed into more balance gender movie.I was more impressed by the subtle but stimulating mental themes of the Disney-like contrast of a thrilling futurist community of Tomorrowland (2015) or the gene splicing creation of Splice (2009) or the action thrills of Aliens (1986) or Predator (1987). In a number of ways the animated sci fi movie Wall*e (2008) possessed more mental and artistic impact than Jurassic World using silence for much of the instead of exciting, explosive action, a much more difficult directorial feat. Even classic sci fi movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) had a much more captivating and magically engrossing visual and mysterious them without all the overly graphic bombardment for the testosterone deprived audience. Without the dry wit of Jeff Goldblum's contributions in the original movies, the overall Jurassic World looses a lot of its charm in the face of so much violence and perhaps unnecessary devastation.",Jurassic World
70,ironhorse_iv,Hold on to your butts. It's time to return to Jurassic Park AKA Jurassic World! It's was surprising very entertaining,7,13 June 2015,"While, this movie does have some cheesy dumb moments. It was Dino-mite for the most part! Directed by Colin Trevorrow, this film is the first of a new era of films in the Jurassic Park series. Like the other two sequels, 1997's Lost World: Jurassic Park & 2001's Jurassic Park 3 in the series, the film uses concepts and characters created by Michael Crichton and original director, Steven Spielberg. So, if you haven't saw the first 3 movie, go see it, before this film. You will notice a lot of homage and nods to them. I have to say, it's a Nostalgia trip! Still, the movie does go a little overboard, with the original Jurassic Park theme song from John Williams a bit. Anyways, this movie is set, 22 years after the disastrous events at Isla Nublar in 1993's Jurassic Park. Since then, the dinosaur park has been rebuild and now is fully-functioning. It's beautiful to see how the park works. Nevertheless, the public has gotten used to the dinosaurs and attendance is slowly declining over the last certain years. Hoping to spark new interest, IGEN create a new dangerous attraction to bring in more visitors. However, it backfires disastrously, leading to once again, chaos and havoc. Can the park employees reclaim law & order in the island, or will the dinosaur once again, ruled the world? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too movie, I kinda enjoyed this movie. Yes, the plot is paper-thin, recycle and predictable, but I can somewhat, overlook this, because how entertaining the film, was, for me. The movie pacing is pretty fast, and straight forward. There weren't hardly any slow moments. Jurassic World takes the best aspects of the first three movies, bits from both the novels, and even some of the games, throws it all into a blender and create a somewhat fun movie to watch. I'm glad, this movie was successful at the box office, because it look like Jurassic Park 3 would have extinct the franchise, but the guess, life found a way. They spared no expense in its production. The movie sets, costumes, and props were wonderful, but the visuals CGI effects, not so much. The dinosaurs didn't look realistic and believable. It's felt like an illusion like a flea circus. I wanted something that looks real, something that people could see and touch. An aim not devoid of merit. Sadly, the movie disappointed me, with its lazy CGI work. It was like looking at a huge mound of dinosaur feces. I wish, the crew use more practical effects. The acting was mixed bag. Chris Pratt stars in the lead role of Owen Grady, a man hired to study the behavior of the Velociraptors. He kinda works as the cool action star, but the movie made him, too much of a badass. He barely had any weakness or fear. There wasn't any moment in the film that I thought, that he might die. It really kill the mood. The movie also fed him, some really awful one-liners, that he delivered in such, a bad cheesy way. Bryce Dallas Howard as park operations manager, Claire Dearing was annoying. While, she has the looks, she doesn't have the charm. Her character was such a headache to watch, due to her greedy and b*tchy attitude. I didn't felt the movie, gave her character, enough time to have a character arch. I really didn't buy Owen and Claire, hooking up. The two stars, barely had any chemistry. I also found it, a bit jarring, that Bryce did all the action scenes, in high heels. It was a little too much. The kid actors, Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins that played her nephews, Grey & Zack, weren't that bad. Honestly, they were pretty good. I just wish, they would show more emotion, during the tense, life-threating action scenes. Irrfan Khan as Simon Masrani, the new owner of the park was great to watch. Still, it was a bit odd, that he flips erratically between comedic relief and angry CEO stereotypes. Jake Johnson and Jimmy Fallon as the tech guys were a lot of laughs. I really love how their character was used by the writers, as a way to make fun of themselves in a Meta and self-unaware fashion. Vincent D'Onofrio as the head of security staff, Vic Hoskins was a little over the top. His military motivations kinda makes the IGEN overthrown plot seem, even more- murky. I was deeply confused. B.D. Wong is the only actor so far reprising his role from the original trilogy, as Dr. Henry Wu, but I was a bit off-putting by his performance. Are the writers trying to makes him, look like another villain!? There's no explanation for why he's become so egotistical and suspicious. The movie seem to have some themes, when it comes to consumer and corporate excess. The Indominus Rex hybrid really embody humanity's worst tendencies, indeed. For a PG-13 movie, the movie had enough gore to feed my inner blood-lust. I just wish, there were more tense suspense moments. At least, the movie have a really cool showdown, toward the end, with the new vs the old, fighting to the death. It was pretty awesome! While the movie has some lazily writing, when it comes to scientific accuracy. The movie does kinda explain, why the dinosaurs in the film, doesn't match up, with the real dinosaurs in a clever way. Still, I would love to see some feather dinosaurs in the film. At least, it didn't use those ugly looking human/dino hybrids concept art. Overall: For a movie that a decade of ""development hell"". It did pretty well. Of course it's not gonna be as good as the first movie, but this is the sequel we deserved! I went in with very-lowered expectations and for the most part, set your expectation, low as well and you might enjoy it as much as I did. I'm recommended watching.",Jurassic World
71,The-Sarkologist,More Genetic Engineering Stuff Ups,5,20 May 2020,"Once again I have decided to continue to watch the Jurassic Park series for some rather unknown reason. I guess it had to do with simply wanting to watch through the series, not that I have huge amounts of time on my hands anyway. So, I've got up to this film, which no doubt was released some time after the previous one, so of course we have different actors, and a different situation as well. Well, not quite because this is still a film about rampaging dinosaurs, and if you have seen the previous ones, then you pretty much can guess what happens in this one as well.However, since numerous years have passed, the park has now opened to the public and it is basically this huge amusement park where people can go around looking at dinosaurs. However, as with all capitalist ventures, they need ways to be able to keep the people entertained, and as such they decide to create this completely new dinosaur. Mind you, as well all stupid human endeavours, the genetically engineered dinosaur escapes and starts running rampant around the park, pretty much killing anybody and everybody.Yeah, as I mentioned, it is basically pretty much like the other three films, except that there are a lot more people, and the park is also operating. Oh, and they have new actors in it as well, so I guess there is that, though I do have to admit that I did quite like Chris Pratt's character, but then again he is able to pull off his roles pretty good anyway. However, unlike the other main characters in the previous films, he seems to be one of those guys whose job is to basically train dinosaurs.Mind you, one interesting thing that is raised in the previous film, and sort of sticks with me here, is that these creatures aren't strictly dinosaurs. The reason for that is that while they have been constructed using genetic material from dinosaurs, these creatures have also had other genes spliced into them to fix up the missing bits. So, as Sam Neill's character mentioned, he doesn't consider them to be legitimate dinosaurs, which is why he would prefer to go back to his digs, not that people are all that interested in them anymore.Yeah, this film was okay, at least for entertainment value, but it really doesn't stand out as much as, well, other films that I have watched. In the end it is just basically more dinosaurs running around terrorising people, and a couple of kids being caught up in the middle of everything. I guess one sort of starts to get a bit sick of dinosaurs after a while, though I do note that they do play up the theme park aspect of the place much more than they did in the previous films.",Jurassic World

77,tomgillespie2002,"As a film of pure spectacle, it's massively entertaining",6,3 November 2015,"Following the calamity of Joe Johnston's Jurassic Park III in 2001, the beloved Jurassic Park franchise was in danger of throwing away its massive potential. After 14 years of rewrites, recasts and director-swapping, the long-awaited fourth instalment arrives with anticipation and high-expectations, and the park is finally open to the public. Now sitting happily as the third highest grossing film of all time, it would seem that the world is still fascinated by dinosaurs, but Jurassic World knows its audience won't be content with the beasties that came before, and has gone for bigger and scarier. By creating its own dinosaur, the formidable (and ridiculously-named) Indominus rex, it certainly achieves this, and also serves as a commentary on corporate and consumer greed.20 years after Dr. Alan Grant gazed upon the sights of Isla Nublar for the first time, Jurassic World is the planet's biggest theme park. Brothers Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) head to the park to stay with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the operations manager. With audience demand on the increase, Claire has overlooked the development of the next big attraction, the lab- created Indominus Rex, which possesses high intelligence along with a collection of attack and defence abilities wound into its DNA from other animals. Navy veteran and velociraptor handler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) thinks its a bad idea, and upon his inspection of the indominus pen, he notices claw marks on the walls and the creature nowhere to be found.Jurassic World still very much follows the formula of what came before - characters arrive, think they're safe, and are soon fleeing and screaming from a variety of giant lizards - but at least director Colin Trevorrow has moved the story on. While throwing in a few new elements, it covers a lot of themes covered in the first movie, with a corporate bigwig (Vincent D'Onofrio) hoping to play God for his own - albeit less innocent - means, and ignoring the warnings of an expert with a better understanding of nature, while children who may just be wiser than their elders find themselves in mortal peril. Yet there is a certain charm to the film's nostalgic elements, and the set-pieces - which range from the exhilarating to the ridiculous - finally feel deserving of John Williams' iconic score.You could pull the film to pieces if you're looking for plot-holes (how would a dinosaur bred in captivity, regardless of its intelligence, know to rip a tracking device out of itself?), but the indominus, despite its McGuffin status, is a suitably nasty antagonist, casually committing genocide as it carves its bloody path towards the tourist centre. Anyone who loved Jurassic Park for its science may be disappointed, as all sense of reality goes out of the window - this is a movie where velociraptors team up with humans to fight a greater threat. But as a film of pure spectacle, it's massively entertaining. It's well aware that it is pandering to a young audience brought up on quick-fixes and everything at their fingertip, and makes a point of this by showing hordes of snot-nosed kids running around the park lacking any sense of wonder. Will humanity ever learn? Unless the plan is to set its recently- announced sequel in a world where man and dinosaur live together in harmony, I guess not.",Jurassic World
78,Thanos_Alfie,After 22 years...,7,16 November 2018,"""Jurassic World"" is an Action - Adventure movie which starts a new era of Jurassic Park film series. After 22 years of the opening of the original Jurassic Park, a new park opens with much more potential than the first and since technology is at a higher level than it used to be before 22 years, bigger, louder and more scary dinosaurs are going to be created. This will have as a result a creation of a dinosaur which is the strongest of them all and is genetically modified from the scientists of the park in order to be able to survive and kill everything.I liked this movie because it had been a lot of time since a dinosaur movie released and it was actually good. It had an interesting plot with some modifications or differences from the original movie of Jurassic Park but the main core of the plot remained the same. I believe that it was a good idea because the director kept the original plot to its core and he built on it his new ideas for this movie and that's why I think Colin Trevorrow did a good job in the direction of this movie. I have to admit that I also liked the interpretation of Chris Pratt who played as Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard who played as Claire. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Irrfan Khan's who played as Masrani and he was also very good because he gave a different touch in some scenes which I believe made the difference and BD Wong's who played as Dr. Henry Wu and he gave the speech of the movie.Finally, I have to say that ""Jurassic World"" is a nice movie, it has great interpretations and a well-written script that will draw your attention and I am sure that you are going to like it very much. I believe that everyone has to watch it and if you are a dinosaur fan let me say that is a must movie to watch.",Jurassic World
79,zkonedog,Definitive Proof That This Is A One-Story Franchise,3,27 February 2017,"""Jurassic World"" was guaranteed to turn a large profit no matter if it was ""good"" or ""bad"". The franchise is quite popular and it just has that ""summer blockbuster"" feel to it. Sadly, I wish that the film's creators would have attempted to make the plot of the film even decent, or create characters that aren't wooden caricatures.For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic World"" sees the vision of Mr. Hammond finally complete...a fully-functional dinosaur amusement park. Of course, in today's ""bigger and better"" society, it isn't good enough just to reproduce classic dinosaurs. Now, new dinos (one bigger than T-Rex and another that can swallow a shark in a single gulp, among others) are being genetically spliced and created in a lab. The park is run by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a profit-driven corporate executive type who doesn't even have time for her two nephews (played by Nick Robinson & Ty Simpkins) when they visit the park. Dinosaur caretaker Owen (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is fully aware of what these dangerous animals can do if not reckoned with. A military sub-plot simmers in the background of the story. The new ""big boy"" dinosaur gets loose, and from there it is what one would expect from this type of film.This movie features an ethical debate about genetic manipulation, two annoying kids who are the definition of stupidity, a lot of rampaging dinosaurs, and and vision to build the most ill-advised theme park in human history. If this sounds at all familiar to you, it is probably because you've seen the original ""Jurassic Park"". I honestly don't know if I've ever seen a sequel (which does not market itself as a remake) that is so unabashedly similar to its predecessor(s).I think the problem with this franchise is simple: It had one great story to tell, and Steven Spielberg did just that in ""Jurassic Park"". All the sequels have failed to capture nearly a glimmer of that magic, because the novelty has worn off and there aren't good stories to tell. At least ""Lost World"" & ""III"" try to bring something original to the screen. ""World"" doesn't even go that far, instead settling for a few new dinosaurs and riding on the name of the franchise. The plots are incredible dumb/predictable and the characters are more of the same.The only reason I won't give this movie a ""bottom of the barrel"" 1-star review is because there are a few exciting scenes (the opening 20-30 minutes shows promise before quickly descending into predictability and repetition) and it is a ""slick"" experience from beginning to end. Even though you know that what you are watching isn't great, there is so much going on and so much action that you can never just mentally ""check out"". In that sense, this really is the textbook ""brainless summer blockbuster"".Even though I came into this viewing experience with mediocre expectations, I was disappointed that ""Jurassic World"" didn't even live up to that standard. If you've been hiding under a rock since 1993 and haven't seen any of the other ""Jurassic"" films, you will love this one! For those who like a little bit of plot and a few interesting characters with their whiz-bang dinosaur action, however, it will be clear to you that this franchise can no longer deliver either of those two things.",Jurassic World

Did not have high expectations. Also having not seen in the original Jurassic Park films, and not being a typical fan of dinosaur films in general.There are some decent pieces of entertainment to be held in this film but overall feels very watered down to attract a family friendly feel and audience.Not many thrills and, characters we do not really care for. Jurassic World currently has an IMDB rating of 7 and this film brought in over $1 billion dollars worldwide- of course ensuring a sequel.

81,eddie_baggins,"This return to the land before time is great fun, if slightly unremarkable",7,11 June 2015,"While there's certainly a lot to enjoy about this latest dino filled popcorn adventure, any number amount of cool ideas and concepts that director Colin Trevorrow and his team have come up with cant help hide the fact that Jurassic World just doesn't have the ""wow"" factor moments that made our first journey to this universe such a blast on release in 1993 and in the ensuing years following. Jurassic World doesn't have any ripple in the water moments, the white knuckle tension of a kitchen full of velociraptors and there are no ingenious moments like poor old Newman being discovered in the safety of a toilet block, and when the star performer of your film is a dinosaur called Blue, Jurassic World pales in comparison to its beloved original but did we ever really expect that to not be the case? It could actually be argued quite strongly, that World is in fact the second best movie of the 4 film franchise.With an empathise on fun and a wealth of huge ideas, World feels relatively short and sharp compared to most other recent bloated blockbuster tent poles and while a large portion of set pieces in the film feel underwhelming and slightly undercooked the film's final 15-20 minutes will be a sure fire hit for fans of the franchise and those keen to get there dinosaur laden destruction fixes on. Colin Trevorrow and his 3 fellow screenwriters also understand the importance of recognising the work that was laid before them and there are neat homages throughout this picture to the foundation Steven Spielberg built, from a visit to a very recognisable visitor centre through to the return of BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu, the legacy of Jurassic Park looms large over the picture yet thankfully never overshadows this much shinier product. Much was made about World's look when trailers started hitting the internet and many fanboys were outraged at what looked like some highly shoddy CGI work but it's with great pleasure I can say World is one of the more spectacular visual popcorn films of some time. The quintessential dinosaurs look fantastic, the Island of Isla Nublar looks splendid and overall the film looks about as polished as you could hope for. With our dinosaurs on point, it's also helpful that our main cast members work well together and while Chris Pratt has virtually transplanted his Starlord persona to a park working, ATV riding hero of the hour, his still a very easy to like presence and shares a good rapport with the always good Bryce Dallas Howard. The human big bad of the piece Hoskins played by Vincent D'Onofrio is a bit of a stumble for the film and his appearances often feel unneeded and distracting in an other wise frequently moving adventure, but luckily the monster big bad is all types of menacing if not quite up the original T-Rex's greatness. Likable and enjoyable without ever reaching grand heights, you wouldn't call Jurassic World overly memorable but it's certainly worth the price of admission for all those seeking adventure, no matter their age. With some hugely impressive visuals, a fantastically designed theme park full of prehistoric wonder and with a mostly likable cast, Jurassic World offers us a great excuse to journey back to the island that wowed us so all those many moons ago, just don't expect to be left with the same feeling received from our first trip to the land before time. 3 and a half Jimmy Fallon safety videos out of 5",Jurassic World
82,johnnyboyz,"Tough to truly dislike, and I'm glad I took the time to track it down, but Jurassic World does not uproot trees.",6,3 April 2016,"Films such as ""Jurassic World"" are so often the most difficult to review; you find yourself in a strange place wherein you really want to like it, but must remember that impartiality and balance are so crucial as to forging views on anything, that to resist them means to completely waste your time in the first place. There is not, in many ways, much to remark about Jurassic World: it does not overstay its welcome; its second unit content is exciting; it a least attempts something resembling character study and manages to take a franchise into new directions without wrecking too much of the nucleus of the initial idea. Unlike, say, recent ""Die Hard"" or ""Terminator"" entries.Many of the ideas coined in the aftermath of the blow-away 1993 success ""Jurassic Park"" by critics and theorists remain; observations which were never meant derogatorily, but are either included here out of a rooted urge to stick to the source material or by way of academic homage. Thus, much of what was written twenty years ago with regards to the symmetry between a theme-park ride and a movie going experience with films such as ""Jurassic Park"" still stand. I believe it was Tom Shone who once remarked that, in a post 1977 Star Wars era, cinema/film-going experiences are becoming more like trips to an amusements park with each passing summer-blockbuster line-up.In Jurassic World, a tracking shot once we are in the park after some formalities is deliberately set up so as to resemble a standard person's height as the park is entered and a woman steps before us with the line ""Welcome to Jurassic World"" – it is the closest to a process of breaking the fourth wall that one can realistically come without cordially turning to the camera and asking the salivating multiplex audience if they are ready for what they are about to experience over the next 90 minutes. It does, in many ways, call to mind Spielberg's self-conscious references to the various items of ""Jurassic Park"" memorabilia which were actually on sale in shops anyway in 1993 by way of his otherwise needless tracking shot around a gift-shop full of theme park memorabilia towards the end of that film.Two strands set the film running, the likes of which somewhat clumsily merge towards the end. The first revolves around two minors: essentially one child and a teenager with Justin Bieber locks and an eye for the girls. They head to Central America and Jurassic World: a realisation of John Hammond's dream to one day build a theme-park where the dinosaurs are the attraction. This is doubly rewarding, because the head of the park is the aunt Claire, played by Bryce Dallas-Howard.The second strand follows an Alan Grant-knock off by the name of Owen Grady, played with a really good balance of energy and vulnerability by Chris Pratt. Grady works in a strange capacity as some sort of dinosaur trainer; a process whereby the once-feared velociraptors are now essentially pets performing tricks at a click. Occupying him on his strand is Vincent D'Onfrio's shady Vic Hoskins, who wants the raptors signed over to the military to essentially fight Al-Qaeda, but we have previous experience of this archetype by way of Paul Riser's character in James Cameron's ""Aliens"".He is present in the park to help Claire with a new hybrid dinosaur the park has created: the Indominus-Rex, which is director Colin Trevorrow's taking of the franchise to bigger places: ""The Lost World"" needed to put a Tyrannosaurus Rex in an urban environment; ""Jurassic Park 3"" needed its Spinosaurus to juice up proceedings and now the 2015 vintage technically needs something that doesn't even exist to keep people interested. With a Tyrannosaurus-Rex in place of the lab-creation, but the film exactly as it otherwise is, things just wouldn't be as much fun. The trouble is, this new creation, echoing perhaps Frankenstien's Monster, is a bloodthirsty killer which does not take to being caged up, and it is not long before things get out of hand once it cuts loose. What follows is essentially a B-movie trussed up like an A-movie, an old adage which, I believe, was once attributed to Spielberg's ""Jaws"" anyway, although not in a derogatory manner, as the kids strive to survive in the wilderness; the park tries to contain the Indominus and Vincent D'Onofrio refuses to take ""no"" for an answer.Along the way, we get plenty of dino-on-human and dino-on-dino action, but Trevorrow has a trick up his sleeve and it is the development of the Dallas-Howard character, whom is transformed from cold and robotic bureaucrat barely able to recall her nephew's name to hard-bodied supporting heroine on the front-line saving their lives. A very physical epitome of this might be the moment she physically tears away some of her clothes beside a waterfall in order to shed one 'skin' and embrace another. Various ""body"" theories have been coined about allowing the viewer to technically gauge just how far along the film has progressed by the state of a lead character's ""body"" without so much as even glancing at a watch.Alas there is not much to marvel at away from the heavy spectacle of dinosaurs doing what dinosaurs used to do to one another, not to mention what they would almost certainly do to human-beings if in close proximity to them, aside from Dallas-Howard's aforementioned arc. Colin Trevorrow should strike us as a shrewd director, in that he manages to pay homage to the 1993 original in fairly audacious ways without ever really encroaching on it. Despite this, he manages to take what now appears to be a franchise that has been re-energised and reinvigorated to new and exciting places. The film is for sure a success, but is not innocent of lacking in several areas.",Jurassic World
83,filipemanuelneto,An unnecessary return to the Jurassic Park,5,9 May 2020,"When I already considered the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise extinct, director Colin Trevorrow decided to bring it back in his first major feature film, that works as a sequel to existing films and was an audacious step for him.The script is very easy to summarize and works as a sequel/reboot: the dubious legacy of John Hammond and InGen is acquired by Simon Masrani. He decides to rebuild the park, a short distance from the original facilities, renaming it Jurassic World. However, they used new dinosaurs in addition to the historical ones, created with genetic crossing. Of course, things get out of control again and everything ends up bad.The worst of this film is extreme predictability. From the beginning, we know more or less what will happen and how it will end. It's just a matter of seeing the details. There are scenes that are truly copied from the previous films, with the addition of some make-up and effects to disguise a weak story and a recipe that has worn out a lot after three films. The lack of tension and sense of danger also disappoint. Even the worst sequels of ""Jurassic Park"" had moments where we felt that the characters could die there. Here, everything is artificial and controlled, like a video game.The cast is, to say the least, irregular. I liked the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt, even though Howard appears in a character who takes a long time to gain our sympathy and who seems quite cold and disconnected from reality in the initial half. Irrfan Khan did a good job by giving life to Masrani, who looks like the mix of a utopian idealist and an unscrupulous capitalist. Less interesting, because totally empty of dramatic value, are the performances of Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, which only exist to be in danger and to be saved, by BD Wong and Vincent D'Onofrio, the cliché of cold individuals who only care about money, and Katie McGrath, who only exists to be eaten alive!It is in the technical details and production values that we can guess how much money was actually invested in this film. The cinematography is very good, with good colors and some scenes and sequences impress by the visual beauty such as the landscapes of the new park, the scenes in the forest or even the walk between dinosaurs inside an electronic glass sphere. There are a lot of special effects and CGI involved, of very good quality. The sound effects, however, and particularly the roars, were recycled from previous films, as well as the soundtrack... but the soundtrack had to be present because it is one of the most iconic ever in cinema!In conclusion ... the film is a production that probably would be excused, as it recycles a formula that has long lost interest in the expectation of making it attractive by throwing it money. It did not work well, with the irregular cast performance and the weak script, without life or emotion, being decisive for the failure. However, it was still able to entertain. You can see it once, but it's not a movie I'd like to revisit.",Jurassic World
84,leplatypus,Jurassic Photoshop (paytv),4,23 July 2017,"You know the feeling of the actual magazines in which all the pictures are enhanced digitally: sure they have no defects but they look terribly fake and at the end, the result is opposite to the one wanted: they inspire no emotion! Here it's the same thing with this movie: Released 22 years after the original Spielberg, you can compare both easily and it gives you an accurate state of filmmaking. So sure the dinosaurs seem real and scary but look at the world they live in: it's either blue (night, inside rooms) or yellow (outside, props, building). So if you have to trade technicolor to have better SFX, I say no! Give me back my colors and my inferior dinosaurs of 1993 because here, after maybe one hour, I was already fed up by this fake world! Now, if I look at the story, it's the same mixed feelings: this is a great thing to discover how the park can actually work, with people and attractions I liked also the wink to the original movie; But, except those few moments, the movie just keep recycling: that is to say doing what has been already done: everything is under tight control except the moment when ; Kids tied to park management in danger; the greedy experts that fails miserably  In addition, there is a lot of pretty stupid stuff: the vanishing dinosaur ? the divorce case ??At the end, the movie is entertaining maybe one hour before becoming totally predictable and fake. As the Star Wars, Alien franchises, I won't look at any quick sequels and just wait another 22 years to take the pulse.. NB: as a french, I feel compelled to add a few words about our most beloved people, the laughable Omar Sy (sadly, his 1st rank is not a joke)! What an American career (translated by our french medias as worldwide notoriety)! After a cameo in X-men, now he just pet raptors and he is as mediocre as ever!",Jurassic World
85,leonblackwood,"Epic action, once it gets going! 8/10",8,1 November 2015,"Review: You see what happens when humans mess with nature! This movie was proper epic and the showdown at the end was amazing. I didn't really see the point why the director added the kids because it would have been much better if it was just based on Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). With that aside, the CGI was amazing and the director done a great job with making it seem like the dinosaurs were really next to the humans. Anyway, this 4th movie in the Jurassic Park franchise, sees a rich business man, Manrani (Irrfan Khan) who wants an new attraction for his popular theme park for all ages, so the scientists come together and build a monstrous, genetic killing machine from the DNA of various dinosaurs. Claire is in control of Jurassic World and she is trying to convince some investors to fund the attraction whilst looking after her nephews who have come to spend some time with her. As she is too busy to spend time with her nephews, they go off on a VIP tour of the theme park, with a guide, to see the various dinosaurs that it has to offer. On another side of Jurassic World, Owen is in charge of the Velociraptors which he has built a relationship with. Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) plays a militant army man who wants to use the Velociraptors as killing machines because Owen has the ability to control them but Owen is totally against the idea and he is more interested in taming the animals who have the ability to become killers. Because of his amazing ability to communicate with the Velociraptors, Claire calls on Owen to have a look at there new genetic dinosaur, the Indominus Rex and they soon realise that he has gone missing. Owen then takes a couple of his work colleagues to see were the dinosaur has disappeared to and they are shocked to see that he has tricked them by making it seem like he was missing but he is really there. The Indominus Rex then escapes from his compound and the ferocious killing machine is heading towards the theme park which has over 20,000 visitors. After many attempts to capture the dinosaur, and failing at every hurdle, Owen turns to his Velociraptors to save the day, only to find out that there species is also in the Indominus Rex DNA. Also, Claire's nephews have gone missing so they have to track them down while everyone is running around in a panic because loads of flying Dimorphodons have been let loose from there compound. Anyway, the only way that they can stop the ferocious killing machine is by releasing the Tyrannosaurus Rex who goes toe to toe with the Indominus Rex, with the help of some Veloraptors. The storyline was very well put together but the director wasted a lot of time on irrelevant material. Once the movie eventually gets going it's full of intensity and some gruesome scenes, for a 12A certificate movie. To me, the Indominus Rex looked pretty scary for a 12 year old and the way that it was killing people is enough to give kids nightmares. Anyway, the attention to detail was spot on and Chris Pratt was the perfect choice for his role. You can tell that he tamed down his acting, compared to Guardians of the Galaxy but there are some comedic scenes which gives the movie a great variety of mixed emotions. I had to watch the showdown at the end a few times because it did shock me, like the end fight in the Incredible Hulk between Hulk and Abomination, so I can't wait to see what they do with the sequel, or should I say the 5th movie. My overall opinion of the movie is that the script was a bit sketchy but the action scenes were amazing. Great, epic film.Round-Up: This movie was directed by Colin Trevorrow, 39, whose only brought you two small movies called Reality Show and Safety Guaranteed starring Aubrey Plaza. He must have given a hell of a pitch to get this project because he hasn't had that much experience behind the camera. With the help of, highly respected, Steven Spielberg as executive producer and Frank Marshall as producer, they really put together a great film but it could have done with a few tweaks in the script. With that aside, it's still the 3rd biggest movie of all time, making a whopping ($1.7Billion), behind Avatar ($2.8Billion) and Titanic ($2.2Billion) so Colin must be very happy with his 1st major project. The first Jurassic Park is in 19th place with $1Billion and Jurassic Park: The Lost World is in 99th place with $612million so, for some unknown reason, much more people paid there big bucks to see this movie, than the original. I did prefer the original movie because of the water shivering in the cup scene, along with the man getting eaten by the dinosaur while he's on the toilet. Anyway, Chris Pratt, 36, has really hit the jackpot with his last 2 movies and with another Jurassic World in the pipeline along with another Guardians of the Galaxy, the Magnificent Seven and the Real McCoy, he has enough projects to keep himself busy. Bryce Dallas Howard, 34, has signed up for the sequel and she is due to star in Disney's remake of Pete's Dragon with Robert Retford playing her father. The chemistry between these two actors was great in the movie and I'm glad that the director didn't push the romantic element. Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $1.7billion (3rd Biggest Movie of All Time)I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy. 8/10",Jurassic World

87,SAMTHEBESTEST,"An awesome,thrilling entertainer but only if you like money making entertainers",7,15 June 2015,"JURASSIC WORLD Review- When i watched its first trailer i was stunned. Too much visuals and those horrible dinosaurs in trailer gave me jitters. Obviously its not first time we see it in Hollywood but it was something different for sure. Everyone was waiting for this horrible experience to release in theater so does me. My expectations were simple i just wanted an entertainment i wasn't expecting quality or good story from movie and after watching the film i can say i am completely satisfied with the movie. It entertained me lot,it kept me busy. I never feel bored while watching it. Makers never wanted to make it as critical acclaimed movie they wanted to entertain people so here they have made a complete money making movie. We have seen dinosaurs in movie before and enjoyed it but this time its not natural its man-made. Story is not that much good but screenplay is very tight and with short 2 hrs runtime it feels much much tight. Visual effects were damn awesome and in 3D its much lovable,it will blow you. If you will ask me what i liked the most in this film then it will be their technical work,vfx and eye catching visual effects. Direction was good. Director cared about what audience want from film and he gave it to us. Sound effects were thrilling it gave me goosebumps. Actors had nothing much to do in film cause film is centralized on dinosaurs still all actors did quite good job. Overall an awesome entertainer which you cant afford to miss. It will give you jitters,goosebumps and dinosaurs will scare you will blow you. Go for it 7 * stars by me.",Jurassic World
88,matthewssilverhammer,Indominus Wreck,4,19 June 2015,"My 2-year-old is just beginning to grasp the English language. One of my favorite phrases of hers is, instead of ""I don't like it"", she proudly proclaims ""I CAN'T like it."" This saying can help with referring to situations in which, no matter how hard you try, you simply are unable to enjoy something. This perfectly encapsulates my feelings for Jurassic World, the uneven follow-up to one of the greatest blockbusters ever. With weak writing and thin characters, I simply can't fully relish in the decent thrills, marginal humor and slight wonder. The story follows the formula to-a-tee: naïve awe, something goes wrong, people die. The film tries to pinpoint this, openly commenting on how jaded audiences are no longer impressed with seeing dinosaurs; they must be bigger, cooler, and have more teeth. This provides for some fun science-vs-business dialogue and cool chaotic amusement park set-pieces, providing some truly great Jurassic moments. Unfortunately in the end, JW is less like a film and more like Universal trying to boost ticket sales for their theme parks, with laughable dialogue and way too many characters to invest in. The failures here are not from lack of trying, but recapturing the magic of the 1993 classic is proving to be almost impossible. The references to that first film are nice, but it only serves as a reminder that we aren't watching that original masterpiece. In JW, the effects are less-convincing, the animatronics are all-but non-existent, and the emotions feel cheaper. So while it may be entertaining enough for a first viewing, it won't be an enduring classic. And I can't like it.",Jurassic World
89,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A thrilling revival of the (pre)historic franchise that's only missing that connection,7,15 July 2015,"When it comes to ""Jurassic World,"" critics will be damned. To date, the film has grossed more than $1.4 billion worldwide, good for fifth most all time, so nothing anyone was going to say could influence the desire to watch this highly anticipated return to Isla Nublar and the world first created by Steven Spielberg. Why audiences were so eager, however, is in ways more intriguing than the film itself.From the trailers, nothing about ""Jurassic World"" appeared to be novel — the park was rebuilt, and now something bigger and scarier than a T-rex has gotten loose. So that suggests the film was an exercise in nostalgic thrills, the excitement of the big bad dinosaur running amok that inspired studios to produce countless '90s and 2000s monster-driven blockbusters. And to that end, ""Jurassic World"" succeeds.A long 14 years since the failed ""Jurassic Park III"" and more than 20 years since the original adventure, enough time passed to build up this franchise's novelty value, a wisely calculated move by Universal Pictures to be sure. Although ""Jurassic World"" doesn't inspire awe and wonder in the same way ""Jurassic Park"" did, it feels refreshing to return to the franchise's overall aesthetic.Entrusted with created the ""dinostalgia"" is director Colin Trevorrow of the indie sci-fi comedy ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" and screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver of the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" prequels. While Trevorrow must simply keep the thrill and pulse of the film alive and throbbing, it's Jaffa and Silver who must create a captivating story that stays true to the formula of ""Jurassic Park.""Jaffa and Silver were an ideal choice, having taken a previously bygone franchise in ""Planet of the Apes"" — not to mention one focused on animals and humans — and surpassed all expectations with the quality of storytelling. ""Jurassic World"" has plenty of compelling moments, effective suspense and a strong sense of danger — it's the character development that's lacking.Not that anyone remembers ""Jurassic Park"" for the characters, but ""Jurassic World"" can't lean on the ""wow"" factor in the way the original could. The main characters comprise an undeveloped mess of two boys, the park director and a dinosaur trainer. All the lovable charisma of Chris Pratt, who gets top billing as the man who has tamed velociraptors, can't save the two- dimensional Owen despite getting all the big reveal/epiphany lines, and as a selfish stick of a character, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire takes a long time to warm up to. Yet neither is the movie entirely about the two young brothers, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), trying to survive. Their troubled home life and fraternal bond gets shoved into a film much more concerned with its dinosaurs.All of these flaws feel irrelevant until the story loses a grip on the suspense it so effectively builds in the first act and most of the second. In fact, there's a quiet moment amidst the chaos of pterodactyls descending upon hapless park tourists that marks the beginning of the film's unraveling. Something happens that proves the film has a poor perspective on its characters and it betrays the credibility of the story in a really unfortunate way.From that point on, ""Jurassic World"" finds a few nice plot twists, but devolves into your typical mindless blockbuster rather than an extraordinary or noteworthy one. You can sense its desire to be the biggest and most epic ""Jurassic"" film rather than holding onto the simplicity that made the original so great — that opened up a sense of wonder, fear but most importantly, curiosity. That's where the heart of Spielberg's film (and so many of his films) comes in, and ""Jurassic World"" never strikes those chords. The most obvious candidate for a sequel since ""Avatar,"" the franchise can only succeed in this way going forward the with a focus on Owen, filling in all that was missing in his back story and giving Pratt a chance to actually shine with the talents he has. That, or wiping the slate clean and giving the new faces a chance to connect more with this exciting world of ""Jurassic Park.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

91,Vartiainen,Still the second best Jurassic movie,7,17 August 2015,"It took four movies, but finally the park is open, and actual paying customers are allowed in Jurassic Park, or Jurassic World as it is apparently now called. Yet despite all this success, unfortunately currents are brewing underneath and once again something will go wrong.And that's pretty much the biggest problem I have with this film. It's the exact same story we've seen three times already. Granted, it is the most logical story when you have dinosaurs bred for amusement parks. Something will go wrong, dinosaurs will run amuck, mass hysteria, yada, yada. But come one, there must be something else you can do with this setting. Shady executives selling dinosaurs for black market businessmen, dinosaur genes used to enhance modern day animals for blood sports, some dinosaurs appearing to be way more intelligent than science would have understand. Anything but this again.We even have the exact same kid characters in need of rescuing. Okay, their names and actors are different, but they're the Jurassic Park kid characters, no changes whatsoever. This is doubly annoying because this time the adult characters are actually pretty interesting and these two brats take away much needed time from them.That being said, the actual movie is okay. Sure the dinos are obviously CGI, but aside from that, they look impressive. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard more than convince as the main adult characters. Irrfan Khan is a lot of fun as the eccentric new owner of the park and the rest of the cast is equally talented. Aside from the kids, that is. And while the main story is painfully similar to the ones before it, there are some new, refreshing touches. Like the fact that the park is actually open this time. The first third of the film flies by with no problems because of this. The ending climax is also very, very cool and almost worth the price of admission by itself.But, in the end, that means that Jurassic World is simply a slightly above average film in general. It's still the second best film in the franchise, but that's not saying much, seeing that parts two and three are not even worth mentioning in polite conversation.",Jurassic World

93,jtindahouse,Great to look at but otherwise not much,5,19 June 2015,"The action in 'Jurassic World' is great. I mean how could it not be? As if dinosaurs by themselves aren't exciting enough, here we have genetically mutated, hybrid dinosaurs that are better and more powerful than ever before. So why does the film feel so flat? The reason is because the fate of almost every character can be predicted from the second we meet them - and the ones that are safest get the most screen time. There was absolutely no way any of the four main characters Owen, Claire, Zach or Gray were ever going to die in this film so every action scene with them in danger just comes across mundane and pointless. Now you could probably say this about a lot of movies where certain characters feel safe, but having four of them is just too much. Contrastly there were characters that were just a ticking time bomb and sure enough were gobbled up by the end. The whole thing was even more predictable than usual.The movie is visually stunning. The dinosaurs are incredibly well animated and the action scenes are well directed. Sadly this is really all it has going for it though. An enormous amount of the jokes fell flat. A full theatre and obvious jokes didn't even raise a murmur anywhere in the room. I think this was more down to poor delivery by the actors than the writing itself. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are passable in their performances but it must be said that everyone else was pretty forgettable and even bad in their role. Nick Robinson was particularly average - just having been chased through the jungle by a dinosaur and he can't even change the flat tone of this voice for one line. Not much to see here.

What will come from this creation? Chris Pratt is pretty enjoyable, almost liked what he played in Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) except he never goes to over the top, he and Bryce Dallas Howard surprisingly good in there scenes together. I think Bryce Dallas Howard is a talented actress, regardless what some critics say. The dinosaur scenes are pretty effective, really keep you on the edge of your seat.

95,jadavix,"Trite and stupid, but with a few good moments",6,21 October 2015,"Everything about this movie is hackneyed and tired, from the characters, to the music, to the CGI. The premise of ""super dinosaurs"" is just fundamentally stupid and insulting. I guess the makers envisioned the inner monologue of the average movie fan like so:""Derrrr, another Jurassic Park movie. I've seen dinosaurs before. Who cares? ...-Wait. It says here they're SUPER dinosaurs. Like, genetically enhanced ones. THAT'S something I haven't seen before. Where do I sign up?""The dinosaurs being SUPER dinosaurs isn't even relevant to the plot and makes no real difference to the movie. The whole concept of the original movie, which made it a winner, was the pitting of humans against creatures who once walked the Earth. Who will win? The fact that the makers went out of their way to create the most realistic specimens ever seen made the experience all the more special.In this case we have an ""indomitus rex"" or some such rubbish, just like the original t-rex but, er, SUPER. The fact that whatever about it is SUPER is not even really shown or explored in the movie suggests that part of the plot was just to sell tickets and convince people they were seeing something different.The depiction of the raptors is also all wrong. Over twenty years later and they're not anywhere near as scary as they were in the original movie. Maybe it's the crap CGI or the way they're depicted as quasi- soldiers, I don't know. Lastly, the music. I am really tired of the orchestral scores movies like this use to heighten the action/suspense. It. All. Sounds. The. Same. I noticed it all the way through Fury Road as well. I think composers hit a wall with that stuff twenty years ago and now they're just reheating the same old stuff. Do filmmakers even need to pay a composer to come up with a score these days? Why not just use another movie's? It's all exactly the same anyway.All that said, this movie does have a few moments where I felt the tension, and unlike Fury Road, at least I could understand what was going on from one scene to the next, though the moment when the dinosaurs get the upper hand on the park-goers is kind of rushed.

The entire movie feels as if the viewer is stranded on the island with everyone else, except that they're on the Island of Poor Decision-Making Skills and not fabled Isla Nublar.Like most people, I was pretty charged up to see the new movie, since it'd been so long since the first go-around that the special effects have become much more invigorating and realistic. As fate would have it, however, the effects looked to be about the same as they had been in 1993, and that's saying something. I even saw the movie in 3D, thinking that lifelike dinosaurs would help make good use of that technology. Nothing doing. The 3D felt almost nonexistent, and not in the sense that it melted into the background (so to speak). It felt, in fact, as if someone had forgotten to leave it on for the duration of the movie.Jurassic World is set in what's more or less the present day. The park has indeed reopened, under the stewardship of Masrani (Irrfan Khan of Life of Pi). Masrani presents himself as someone who doesn't care so much about profits as he does about people being entertained and wowed by the park's attractions. Yes, sort of reminiscent of John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough) and his grand vision for the original park. Masrani's operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), as the movie opens, is showing off the park to potential sponsors. You know, like the Coca-Cola Pavilion at the World's Fair. Or whoever sponsors Spaceship Earth in EPCOT Center, for those of you who have no idea what the World's Fair was.The same day that Claire meets with the sponsors, her nephews Gray and Zach arrive for some bonding time. Seems Mom and Dad decided to send the boys to the park so that they could interact with Aunt Claire, who hasn't seen them in seven years or so. The presence of the kids on the island forecasts doom from the get-go, because certainly at some point they need to be imperiled. Don't worry; they will be. Being a stereotypical hard-driven, childless woman, Claire hands the boys over to her British assistant, who promptly loses (is ditched by) them. Older brother Zach is moody and somewhat sullen, as teenage boys are wont to be, and younger brother Gray is full of both energy and dino details, much like Timmy from JP1.This time around, the big attractions aren't the T-Rexes (or their exes - ha!); they're bigger and badder. The park's new creature is called Indominus rex, which turns out to be a hybrid of a T-rex and several other animals. Don't ask which animals; it's a secret to everyone, even Claire and Masrani. At any rate, to make sure everything's good to go before the new dinos are unveiled to the public, park trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is called in to evaluate little Indommy's paddock. The paddock looks secure, all right, but wouldn't you know it, the beast appears to have departed, presumably for a place where one can swallow cows whole without having to wait for a server to show up.And with that, our plot is really set in motion. There's a dino on the loose! It's funny how this keeps happening. Only now, instead of a few people who are scoping out the park before it officially opens, there are tens of thousands of people on the island, with the park fully open for business. But there's no reason to close the park, right? Of course not! It is not revealing anything of importance to mention that the first group of guards to try to contain Indominus carry nonlethal weapons. You know, so they can stun a seven-story tall monster. This is not as effective as you might think.Jurassic World is much more action movie than sci-fi movie. Instead of human characters exhibiting human characteristics, we're presented with an relatable group of people. Pratt's Owen is a hero, a good guy who has qualms about mistreating all creatures, but he's more Rambo than Indiana Jones - or Alan Grant. I like that he's there to save us all, but the lack of development of his character, who's sort of a combination of Grant and Ian Malcolm, means the movie takes a step backward in terms of fundamentally sound, creative writing. Perhaps this is the result of four different people having a hand in the screenplay.If you're too young to have experienced Jurassic Park or just plain like dumb and loud action movies, Jurassic World should please you. Kids should like it, particularly since there's little to really scare the pants off them. There are several homages to not only the first JP but also JP II and JP III, which does place this one solidly in the same cinematic universe as those other three. But two hours of chase scenes interrupted by too many haphazardly animated, similar-looking dinosaurs fighting each other and smashing humans may grow tiresome as you await the inevitable and foregone conclusion. Not to mention the obvious setup for a fifth movie.",Jurassic World
98,PWNYCNY,"A great science fiction movie, a take off on the Frankenstein story. Total mayhem on the screen.",10,15 June 2015,"This movie is about what happens when people dabble in areas of research that are best to be left alone. It is about what happens when military and business interests conspire to engage in projects without any outside controls. It is about what happens when people become smug and complacent to the point of recklessness. It is about what happens when science is perverted for the sake of profit. It is about what happens when caution is tossed into the wind. It is about what happens when nature is violated. It is about what happens when freaks of nature are produced for all the worst reasons. It is about what happens when the scientist loses his moral compass. It is about the arrogance of man. It is about the consequences of unrestrained materialism. This movie contains all the elements of a great science fiction movie. First, it has an excellent and highly inventive story. The idea of dinosaurs working with humans is engaging. Its rationale as explained in the movie is not beyond the realm of plausibility. Second, the special effects are spectacular. The movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species of dinosaurs, some friendly, some lethal. Third, the dinosaurs are not demonized. Instead, they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated. Fourth, the story includes good guys and bad guys. Fifth, the action is nonstop. The principle characters are literally running throughout the movie. Sixth, the script includes many clever and corny lines that evoke laughter. Seventh, the movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed for profit. The cast is excellent. Vincent D'Onfrio is especially strong as the head of park security who is actually a sell out for the profiteers. But the biggest star are the special effects which in this movie are entirely necessary and in no way gratuitous. For this movie to succeed as a drama, it has to be able to depict the total mayhem and terror caused by the irresponsible conduct of those who sacrificed the public good to make a quick buck. One other point: This movie succeeds in drawing from other great science fiction movies, like Predator, Frankenstein and Jurassic Park to produce an original, unique and powerful dramatic story.",Jurassic World
99,stevendbeard,Dino-West World,7,12 June 2015,"I saw ""Jurassic World"", starring Chris Pratt-Guardians of the Galaxy, Jennifer's Body; Bryce Dallas Howard-The Help, The Village, Oh Yeah, she is Ron Howard's daughter; Vincent D'Onofrio-Daredevil_tv, The Cell; Judy Greer-Entourage, The Village and BD Wong-Oz_tv, Jurassic Park.There have been 3 previous Jurassic Park movies-1993, 1997 & 2001-and this one is a sequel to the 1993 original, at least that is what the director Colin Trevorrow says. This movie is produced by Steven Spielberg, who had a hand in the previous entries. Jurassic World is a functioning dinosaur amusement park and has been running for about 10 years. Bryce is in charge of public relations and gives tours to heads of corporations that may be future investors-Hey, it takes money to run the park. There are dino petting zoos, holograms and gyrospheres that look like a giant hamster ball that lets tourist see dinosaurs up close. There are even tracking devices implanted in the dinosaurs so they know where every animal is, at any given time. Chris plays a sort of dino-whisperer; he has a limited control over 4 velociraptors that he has practically raised since birth. Vincent has his own ideas about the trained dinosaurs, such as weaponizing them to use in the Middle East. Judy plays Bryce's sister that decides to send her 2 sons on a vacation to Jurassic World-hey, her sister works there, how dangerous could it be? BD plays a scientist-FYI, he is the only actor that was in the original movie that is in this installment. After 10 years, the attendance has dropped a little and needs some fresh blood, so to speak-whenever a new attraction is added, attendance spikes. Some one even says that what they really need is something bigger with more teeth. BD gets right on the job and starts splicing genes and creates a brand new dinosaur called Indominus Rex. This new hybrid has features from various creatures that make it highly intelligent; it can change colors for camouflage and even elude heat sensors. Now, what could possibly go wrong with any of that? How about dinosaur chaos with rampaging animals on an island full of tourist? There are a few nods or references to the earlier movies for sharp eyed fans. I have been asked if it is suitable for kids-it is ""PG-13""-and I guess it depends on the kids, because there is a lot of people and other animals that get killed by Indominus Rex. This movie reminded me a little bit like West World; another amusement park that has gone crazy. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Jurassic World

101,drqshadow-reviews,"Big, Dumb and Plodding, Like the Brainless Beasts it Boasts",5,25 June 2015,"Possessing neither the industrial significance nor the inherent majesty of the Spielberg original, it was always going to be a tall order for this modern revival to stack up. It's wise to do its own thing for the most part, though nudge-grin-wink references to the first film appear shamelessly (and, often, charmingly) around every corner. And while it's fun to point and smile at the familiar scraps of a 22-year-old film, at some point it feels like the new effort is too frightened of its own merits to cast them aside. At root, it's a simple mindless summer disaster movie with the spice of CGI dinosaurs thrown in where the earthquakes/volcanoes/tidal waves would usually go. Measured against that standard, it's still an awfully dumb bucket of over-familiar plot churn, but it feels more understandable and appropriate. Long gone are the delicate ruminations on nature, humanity and our impending role as technological gods, tossed in favor of more sizzle and fresh dino gimmicks. For all the trailer's promises that the new big bad is meaner, faster and - most importantly - smarter, it really doesn't seem to do all that much beyond stomping around the park and killing anything in sight. The new cast, helmed by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (who, impressively, manages to dash through jungle and mountain in a pair of stylish heels), doesn't seem much brighter. A fair enough way to kill a couple hours at the cinema, but be prepared for a healthy dose of eyeball-rolls and manufactured drama.",Jurassic World
102,GiraffeDoor,Best yet (probably),8,5 August 2019,"As good an update to a semi-dated classic as anyone could ask for.With humour, the sense of adventure and danger expertly applied, the movie sends its own franchise up a little bit and is charming in that respect.Of course it's visually stunning. You might say it's derivative and unoriginal but so is everything Spielberg's ever been attached to. I gave it 8/10 what more do you want?Oh, and I love that workaholic character who rises to the occasion in when things get pear shaped.",Jurassic World
103,alindsay-al,a great addition to this beloved franchise,7,20 June 2015,"In the summer of sequels and reboots after 14 years we have the next Jurassic park film : Jurassic world and I am happy to report that this is a great film. The premise of this movie is set 20 years after the original Jurassic park and the park is now open as a theme park. With attendances down corporate decide they need a new attraction and after creating a new type of dinosaur it escapes and chaos ensues. Now I loved Chris pratts performance in guardians of the galaxy and in this film he proves that it is absolutely no fluke as he is great. He was his charismatic self with allot of humour and depth to the character which made him a really cool lead for this film. Bryce Dallas Howard is the head of the park and at the beginning of the film I didn't really like her character but I like the arc her character goes through in the film and by the time we are meant to care about her character I did. Now their are some awful characters in this film and the two kids are a big part of it. It's not the actors thats the problem it's the amount of time the story focuses on them and just the fact that there characters aren't interesting at all. Fresh from playing Wilson fisk in daredevil Vincent donofrio is a military villain in this film and it's not that his performance is that bad it's just that his plan is crazy and that his character is writ to be really cliché and it makes you to not care about his character. the creation of the indominous rex was a great villain and she really was a great killing machine for this film. Now one thing I like is that they make out that corporate is the reason for the creation of the indominous rex is that corporate needed more attractions was interesting and made complete sense. I also liked the character arcs of Howard and Pratt with also the undertones of the franchise kept in play. However, there are allot of side stories that I really did not care about and I think it takes away from the whole experience of the film. The script is great with a great blend of humour and drama that do flesh out some of the characters and make the horror of the situation feel real. A great part of the film is that the style of this film completely catches the awe and and wonder that Jurassic park had and use cgi to enhance the dinosaurs and make them feel even more bigger. The fight scenes are great and make the dinosaurs feel like huge attractions and prove that they are really the stars of the film. Overall this is a great film and I can't wait to see the eventual sequels that will definitely come with this film.",Jurassic World
104,estebangonzalez10,Chris Pratt and his raptors might be enough to save the franchise,6,12 June 2015,"""You just went and made a new dinosaur? Probably not a good idea.""This review of Jurassic World is brought to you by Mercedes Benz and classy high- heel running shoes. After the success with his sci-fi indie film, Safety Not Guaranteed, Colin Trevorrow was given the reigns to direct the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. With the help of his collaborator, Derek Connolly, he co- wrote the script based on Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver's story. It was a pretty risky move considering Trevorrow hadn't worked on a big budget film before, but with all the product placement included here you can tell he was probably very restricted and controlled by the executives. But I'm not going to complain about that because if you think about it Jurassic Park also had tons of product placement and that is one of my favorite blockbuster action films of all time. Jurassic World tries to pay homage to the first film ignoring most everything that happened in the sequels and once the dinosaurs are set lose it succeeds in doing so. The set-up was probably unnecessary and by far the weakest part of the movie as most of the characters here were uninteresting and we could've done without the introduction of so many of them. Fortunately Chris Pratt shows up soon enough with his domesticated raptors and saves the movie from derailing entirely from its rather stupid plot. He's the new Indiana Jones and he can make the dumbest screenplay seem cool and entertaining. He delivers the perfect amount of comedic relief and has some great actions scenes to carry the movie. The dinosaurs are spectacular as always and there were a couple of thrilling scenes, although Michael Giacchino's score never matches the brilliance of the original (there is a cool piano cover of the original Jurassic Park theme however that delivers plenty of nostalgia to fans). Jurassic World doesn't live up to the high standards set by the original which was a masterpiece, but it's as slightly satisfying a sequel as the rest of the films in the franchise. I wouldn't go as far as saying it is better, but Chris Pratt does make it a lot easier to enjoy.So Jurassic World is set some 20 years after the events of the original film. John Hammond's vision of a dinosaur theme resort has been functioning for over a decade now in Isla Nublar. Unfortunately the attendance rates in recent years has been dropping as the enthusiasm and novelty of seeing these live beasts has died down a bit. The owner of the resort, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), has ordered his scientists to genetically engineer a bigger and meaner dinosaur knowing that this will spark more interest. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is in charge of organizing and managing the park and one of her responsibilities is making sure this new dinosaur remains contained. Simon asks her to talk to Owen (Chris Pratt), one of the on-site staff members who's in charge of conducting behavioral research on Velociraptors, and ask him to give his opinion on the safety of the creature's new home. Owen had no prior knowledge of what these scientists had been doing and is not happy about the management's decision, but before he has time to do anything the creature escapes and now they must alert the thousands of people who are at the park that a dangerous dinosaur is on the lose. Claire's nephews, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson), happen to be visiting the park and of course they don't pay attention to the warning and are left stranded near the danger zone. Claire asks Owen to help her find them and thus the thrills begin. There are several other characters in this film that aren't given much depth. It's a shame because a talented cast including Vincent D'Onofrio, Jake Johnson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Judy Greer are entirely wasted. Johnson has some fine scenes and it's cool he got to wear a Jurassic Park vintage t-shirt, but his character didn't have much to do really. The entire plot revolving around D'Onofrio's character felt recycled from the first sequel and was quite silly. Omar Sy, I love him, but he wasn't given anything remotely interesting to do. The two kids in this film are as exciting as watching two brothers who don't get along. I've already said that Chris Pratt is the saving grace of the film along with the dinosaurs, but he also has some great scenes with Bryce Dallas Howard as well. She's perhaps the only other redeeming character in the film although at times it felt like she was trying too hard to be Jessica Chastain. It's kind of hard to feel that same level of suspense we all got from the first film when there aren't many characters to root for here. Fortunately the film doesn't take itself too seriously and it ends up being a lot of fun and the less you sit down to think about it the more fun you will have watching the dinosaurs hunt down the visitors. I think that Trevorrow knew the premise was silly and used the genetically engineered dinosaur story as an allegory as to what the audience wants from a sequel: They've already seen the dinosaurs and are getting tired of them, so why not give them a more threatening one, and so he did. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Jurassic World

106,Fluke_Skywalker,Originality is extinct,6,15 June 2015,"Director Collin Treverrow's 'Jurassic World' certainly looks great. The production values, design, cinematography and special f/x (despite some reviews I've seen to the contrary) are all top notch. But what it's sorely lacking is substance and originality. I get that a movie about rampaging dinosaurs isn't exactly going to be a character study, but the original still managed to give us at least a little characterization for our human players. And it's an unabashed rehash of the original, but plays more like a mediocre tribute band than the real thing.But ultimately the worst sin committed by 'Jurassic World' just may be that it isn't very much fun.",Jurassic World
107,Lechuguilla,Those Lovable Dinosaurs,5,31 December 2016,"It's more tolerable than most blockbuster films, but only because the dinosaurs, however digital, still make effective characters. Not so with the humans who come across as stereotyped and annoying. I didn't know some of the human characters' names until the end credits. The human cast probably exceeds a thousand. Then there are at least a billion extras, nameless human chumps eager to tell their grandchildren they were once in a Spielberg movie.And though not directed by him, this is, after all, a Steven Spielberg movie. That's all you really need to know, as in: action is more important than characters, plot, dialogue, casting, or acting. But, hey, the production design is good. And visual effects are really spectacular. Mostly, the film aims to please a 12 to 24 year old, easily wowed, viewer demographic.Of all the irritations here, which include a predictable Disney-style plot, none is more annoying than the loud background music. It's a manipulative and insulting device, to remind us that the film aims to be epic in scope and costly in budget. Which is made worse by the film's run-time. At least 15 to 20 minutes could have been shaved off, mostly in the second half repetitive action.But the dinos are still lovable. Of course, that's cinematic manipulation, too, to get us to care for and relate to these nonexistent creatures. Ever since I watched ""Walking With Dinosaurs"", I have enjoyed researching these prehistoric beings. ""Jurassic World"", with all its Steven Spielberg cinematic faults, gives us plenty of them, and for me that makes this blockbuster at least tolerable.",Jurassic World

I did sort of like Bryce Dallas Howard, though. Also Katie McGrath. I realize that it is not intended to be super-realistic movie. But a couple of the numerous plot holes bugged me immensely. One is kids(!) being able to start and drive a jeep that had been abandoned for 22 years. Wow. Another was Ms. Howards ""ridiculous"" shoes.

114,3xHCCH,Badass Chris Pratt and Dinos!,7,10 June 2015,"In 1993, we were all awed by the first ""Jurassic Park"" film by Steven Spielberg. We remember that moment when our jaws dropped when we saw that first Brachiosaurus appear on screen. We definitely felt the fearsome terror of the T-Rex and the Velociraptors as they went on their rampages. Everything looked and felt so real, fully deserving of all the technical awards it won. Now, 22 years later, ""Jurassic World"" brings us back to Isla Nublar where it all began. John Hammond's vision is now a very popular theme park, with interactive rides and activities with the dinosaurs. Claire Dearing is the park's uptight all-business operations manager. She is having a particularly hectic day when her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) arrive for a visit. Serious problems arise concerning the park's latest, largest and most vicious hybrid creation, the Indominus Rex. Claire calls on Owen Grady, the park's onsite Velociraptor trainer, to save the day.Despite the existence of ""sequels"" ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" (1997) and ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001), ""Jurassic World"" is THE true sequel to the first ""Jurassic Park."" It is set in the same Costa Rican island where the first film was set. We see numerous references about the first film here as characters stumble into the ruins of the original resort in this film. We still see Dr. Henry Wu (B.D.Wong), the park's chief geneticist, the only human character from the first film in this one. And of course, there is the T-Rex.Now under the ownership of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), the dinosaurs of the park have become mere commercial assets of a big business. The initial scenes show us the shallowness of what the park has become: kids riding baby Triceratops in a petting farm, boating and safariing among the plant-eaters, watching the gigantic Mosasaurus performs like a dolphin in a pool. The stuffy Claire, in her stiff hairdo, designer outfit and stilettos, represents this cold corporate philosophy. It is this philosophy of wanting to be constantly ahead that led to the ill-advised splicing of the DNA of various dinosaurs and other species creating the ultimate high-IQ killing monster, which would later be the park's own undoing. Practically all the adult human characters in this film are unlikable: greedy, petty, heartless.Lead star Chris Pratt plays probably the only likable character in this film. His Owen is the only one we all rooted for as he badass-ly led his posse of Velociraptors on a motorbike. He basically plays his charming ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" character, but a smarter, less goofy, no- nonsense version. That her high heels get more attention than her acting does not speak too well of Bryce Dallas Howard's annoying performance as Claire. I guess her character was really supposed to be annoying so she is probably doing it right, yet she was blandly uncharismatic as a leading lady. The original timeless theme music by John Williams effectively evokes a sense of nostalgia as it gets played. The story telling by Steven Spielberg in the 1993 original though, remained superior over this one by newcomer Colin Trevorrow, riddled with some illogical close calls and questionable dinosaur psychology. The brotherly bonding between Zach and Grey was used as an emotional core, but it did get a bit too unrealistically sweet in the end (predictably so). Owen and Claire's love affair did not really seem to be necessary, yet they also put that in for some romance angle. The ethical and political issues about genetic bioengineering are touched on once again, just as the first did, with a bit less sting this time.Overall, the main highlight are still the dinosaurs. The awe we felt during the first film cannot be replicated, but the thrill is still there. Every time a giant meat-eater approaches a human character, the fearful tension created is heart-pounding, as it was before. The visual effects are first rate as ever, made even more realistic by updated technology, as are the sound effects that accompany the action. We all felt we were those kids riding that cool glass gyrosphere gazing up in wonder as the vestiges of a lost world roamed around us. 7/10.",Jurassic World
115,drystyx,Retarded and full of Nazi genocidal brainwashing,1,15 June 2015,"Trevorrow and Jaffa have joined the ranks of the completely uninspired and completely without strategy in their desire to keep up the Hollywood clichés and the brainwashing.On the surface, this is a dinosaur sci-fi film with people trying not to be eaten, though it looks like they can't wait to be eaten. The effects are good, which makes it even worse, because it's wasted on the worst and most hate filled control freak script of the series of Jurassic movies.It's bad enough the characters are all retards, save a few underlings. The hero, his sidekick, and the younger of the boys alone show even a trace of not being retarded, while all of the other characters are not only retarded, and not only do all of them have superiority complexes common with the control freaks who dish this crap out, but all of them are thoroughly boring creeps that make the audience look at watches, like I did, throughout the film.There's more to alienate the audience, or at least to alienate the young men. Throughout the series, we've been forced to watch dull plain blond women over and over, and we knew no harm would befall them, and just as contrived, Nazi card carrying Trevorrow and Jaffa introduce the first hot chick, the first brunette, for the sole purpose of making her the only female fatality in the entire series.The selective sex genocidal statement is not only obvious and undeniable, it's pathetic and overt. Oh sure, women may like this idea, but movies present a world, and this world is the most depressing one imaginable to a heterosexual young man. This was all that the control freaks like Coppola and Leone did in the late sixties and seventies, and all their Nazi trainees did in the eighties, and now the genocidal monsters froth at the mouth to go retro to that hate filled era that spawned much of the same in reality. These punks know what they're doing, and they can deny it all they want, but it's all they do.There is no strategy to anything Jaffa writes or Trevorrow directs. Absolutely no inspiration. They hate inspiration. That should be evident from the poor credibility of how their characters act, and their fascination with poor characters. The older brother, for instance, hasn't one saving grace. Nor does the heroine. They're beyond being mere ""creeps"". They're absolute human monsters, and what we see here is an acceptance of such monsters to be okay, and to believe they can change.They can't change. And the maniacs who made this movie prove it. Undeniably the worst of the Jurassic Park series, and a complete embarrassment. All they wasted on the creatures and effects is meaningless with their poor job on human characters and on their desire to produce their Nazi genocidal mission.I don't know who is sicker. Trevorrow, Jaffa, or the human scum who applaud them and keep them in their undeserved status.",Jurassic World
116,aharmas,Raptors!,9,20 June 2015,"Movies are made to entertain us, and ""World"" does a very good job. It brings back the park, enhances it with new rides, and giving us state- of-the-art special effects. Twenty years ago, the illusions were breathtaking because they were fresh, and the technological advances keep raising the bar, and like one of the protagonists in the film said it: audiences keep demanding bigger and better.There is something winning about seeing those mythical creatures come back to life and teach us the error of our ways. One shouldn't wander into their territories and expect no consequences, and we should have learned by now that playing God is a recipe for trouble. We have seen the T-Rex in action, and the devious raptors cause plenty of chaos. Why would anyone want to bring them back after all the havoc they caused in the last three films? Because we have audiences that are hungry for their adventures.Scientists have gone completely crazy now as they use genetic engineering to come up with a more terrifying looking beast that unfortunately combines many of the species used to produce its distinctive look and qualities and as a certain scientist tells us that you can't have something that looks scary without other behavioral traits.The new dinosaur is bigger, meaner, and more psychotic than its other relatives. It manages to trick the park security and before we learn how to say its name correctly, he goes on a killing rampage, having a definite taste for targeting humans. In an interesting twist, raptors are back and can be trained to work as ""security"". The idea is interesting and laughable since we have already forgotten these creatures aren't exactly docile.Here comes Chris Pratt, with his matinée idol presence, being a bit of a ""raptor charmer"", or maybe he's just a very good teacher. He has taught them well and earned somewhat their trust; he just doesn't know that these raptors might soon discover they have an unexpected alliance with some of the park's other residents, and it doesn't involve being friendly to humans.There is plenty of spectacle as children are being chased, nannies and other security personnel become dinosaur chow, and the park manager can fashionable wield an automatic weapon and run even faster than some of the other people in five-inch heels. Howard has plenty of fun playing a female Indiana Jones and is Pratt's match. She's also quite an aunt to those nephews she neglects and almost feeds to her new park attraction.Lastly, one mustn't forget this is like a park ride. There is not much to think about, just get on it and enjoy the new offerings, the thrills, the looks, and the scares. Otherwise, stay home and read a book because this is not food for thought but a thrill for the audience.",Jurassic World
117,peterp-450-298716,A worthy successor of the first movie. That's for sure !,7,23 June 2015,"""Monster is a relative term.To a canary,a cat is a monster.We're just used to being the cat"" Universal Pictures pulled out his magic box once again and gathered a horde of extinct dinosaurs,which are resurrected with the use of some scientific tricks, on the big screen.Looking at the box office (apparently almost $ 1 billion),it seems like everyone was eagerly looking forward to seeing those prehistoric mastodons rumbling around again.Although some scientists were so quick off the mark to prove that some things don't correspond to reality (not all dinosaurs lived in the Jura era,the velociraptors weren't bigger than a turkey and were covered with feathers,the mosquito from which the DNA was extracted, didn't suck blood and the mosasaur wasn't so big as it's portrayed),it's still a lot of fun.I was ready to be overwhelmed and before I knew it,I was looking at the bottom of my bag of popcorn,which is a good sign and a reliable value indicator when it comes to the entertainment content of a feature film.After the amazing and impressive Jurassic Park in 1993 (Damn,that's 22 years ago),two lousy sequels were released for the Dino-crazy public. Unlike the first film,of which I can recall large parts as if I saw it yesterday,I barely can remember anything of the two successors.And let's not mention the awful rip offs that were subsequently thrown on the market (recently I gave ""Jurassic City"" a chance and already dropped off after 10 minutes due to lousy special effects).In ""Jurassic World"" they returned to the successful formula of the well-known theme park.Only now it's not an empty amusement park,which should be approved by a select group of scientists,but a crowded park where the owners want to add a new attraction.But again the end result is less attractive and cozy.It's perfectly summed up by the words of Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) in ""The Lost World"" : ""Yeah.Ooh and ah, that's how it always starts.But then later there's running and screaming"".The two teenagers Gray and Zach,the first one is a dinosaur fanatic and the second one has more interest in the opposite sex,are on their way to the amusement park of InGen,where their aunt Claire works as a operations manager.Of course,the latter doesn't have time to babysit and she leaves them in the hands of her assistant Zara.To ensure the income of the park and meet the demands of the main sponsors,the small army of geneticists fabricated a hybrid version which would be even more frightening than the existing species.They use the genes of prehistoric predators and contemporary species.The owner of the park wants Owen Grady,the Velociraptor trainer,to check the enclosure of the hybrid.And soon Owen comes to the conclusion that once again they are playing with fire.Is ""Jurassic World"" an impressive film? Yep. Did the special effects and computer animation make me drool again ? Yep. Are those fearsome dinosaurs overwhelming again ? Yep. Did it exceed the first film ? Uh, actually not quite. What makes this film memorable ? Well, the park itself for starters. A sort of Disneyland but with unparalleled attractions. The monorails, the infrastructure, the holographic displays and the overall total picture were impressive. The mosasaur was the masterpiece of this film. Superbly imaged. Both the physical appearance as his natural living space. The ""gyrospheres"" and the accompanying scenery is the first attraction I would like to try out. The action-packed part at the pterosaurs cage was breathtaking. But the rest of the used scenes showed similarities with the first film. A park where the situation turns out to be life threatening. Again a couple (who had a thing in the past most probably) need to bring two teenagers in safety while they are surrounded by dangerous prehistoric creatures. Even Claire imitated the dress of Dr. Sattler at one time: an unbuttoned shirt over a T-shirt.What I didn't get while watching ""Jurassic World"", were shivers down my spine and goosebumps moments. Emotionally, I don't think there'll ever be another movie (with prehistoric monsters) that surpasses the experience I had while watching ""Jurassic Park"". When Dr. Grant turned around,peered over the valley where different prehistoric species wandered around and said ""Look at that. It's a dinosaur."", my hair stood straight up. When the T-Rex left his cage and started chasing the jeep and you could see the gaping mouth approaching in the rear-view mirror. The raptors sneaking through the kitchen with two teenagers scared to death. These are all particular moments I've missed in ""Jurassic World"". Yes, it was terribly exciting and impressive to see. But that subtle difference was there anyway. I also missed a character like Jeff Goldblum with his dry humor and pertinent observations. And then of course the charismatic dreamer John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who saw a fantasy collapsing. In some ways it was all there, but it didn't feel the same way.But forget about my nitpicking and hurry to a cinema to watch this two-hour action packed, exciting and entertaining film. The success of ""Jurassic World"" is its link with the first movie and the overall nostalgic value. You can add the question ""How did you feel after watching Jurassic Park?"" to the long line of historical questions such as ""Where were you when Kennedy was shot ?"" And ""What were you doing when the radio broad-casted Elvis passed away ?"". ""Jurassic Park"" had a major influence on films that appeared after wards. My main conclusion is that ""Jurassic Park"" was far ahead when it's about CGI, because the creations at that time looked as lifelike as those in ""Jurassic World"". But I am quite convinced that I'll never set foot in such a park, would it ever exist in reality ...PS. Funniest moment for me : pay attention to what a visitor does during the pterosaurs attack ... Yes, he saves two cocktails ! I almost choked on my coke! More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Jurassic World
118,Enchorde,Diluted ideas with good action,6,21 October 2016,"It is quite easy to sum this up, it's another Jurassic Park. There is the same misguided attempt at growing dinosaurs for a theme park. Some or all of the dangerous dinosaurs will escape and go on a killing Spree. And finally, yes, some kids will end up in the middle of it. Knowing that, it delivers what is expected. The effects are really good (it feels wrong to call them realistic when they're creating dinosaurs) and the action is evenly spread throughout the movie. The entertainment was good.However, I couldn't help but sigh when I understood the main monster. This time it isn't enough to have a big bad dinosaur running wild. The dinosaur must of course be genetically enhanced, and for example now being super smart and setting traps, in addition to having stealth ability, being able to withstand grenades without much problem and much more. Unfortunately this gives the movie too much flavor of the low budget monster movies.So, the craftsmanship in doing an action movie is good. I just wish that next time (yes I'm sure there will be a next time) there will be a little more originality in the plot.6/10",Jurassic World
119,ShootingShark,We Need More Teeth !,6,11 July 2015,"Gray and Zach's parents send them on a holiday to dinosaur theme park Jurassic World, where their Aunt Claire is a senior official. Once there however a top secret new exhibit - the Indominus Rex - breaks out of its enclosure and starts wreaking havoc. It's up to Aunt Claire and park ranger Owen to save the kids.This is the third sequel to Steven Spielberg's classic 1992 monster movie and, like all sequels, covers the same ground as the original, but is likable, well made, well acted, exciting, and has a good balance of action, scares and laughs. Visually, it's beautiful to look at, with fabulous sets by Ed Verreaux and excellent visual effects by Tim Alexander and Glen McIntosh. The genetically modified Indominus Rex is nice and scary but just a T-Rex variant, but for dinosaur fans there are some great creatures on show, such as the huge aquatic Mosasaur, the spiky-armour club-tailed Ankylosaurus, an epic Pteranodon flying attack sequence and those perennial Jurassic film favourites the Velociraptors. The human cast are equally good, with Howard doing a terrific transformation from soulless corporate businesswoman into breathless, ripped-clothes, monster-fighting Sheena Queen Of The Jungle, Pratt a solid square-jawed traditional macho hero, and D'Onofrio stealing the show as the sneaky bad guy with the military agenda and a great cheesy last speech. My only problem with the film is the too-busy script, which has so many threads (the boys' divorcing parents, the brothers bonding theme, Claire and Owen's old romance, Claire's career aspirations, Masrani's misguided philanthropy, the gene-splicing corporate espionage, the raptor training, the military asset angle, the let's-eat-the-tourists threat, the control room takeover, several others); once it settles down into the main rescue the kids and save the day story, it's much more focused and dramatic. The golden rule in most things is keep it simple, and movie scripts are no exception. But all in all a good Saturday afternoon creature feature, with a solid cast and thrills aplenty. Featuring yet another excellent score by the prolific Michael Giacchino - the wordless scene where Owen and Claire come across the dying Apatosaurus is perhaps the best in the movie - this is good blockbuster monster fun.",Jurassic World
120,valleyjohn,I wanted everyone to die.,4,29 July 2015,"The overriding thing i took away from watching Jurassic World was not that the characters were utterly stupid ( they were ) or that the story was dull and predictable ( it was ) , it's that considering this film was made 22 years after the original it doesn't look any better . In fact i would say it looks worse. I was looking forward to watching Chris Pratt again after his brilliant performance in Guardians of the Galaxy but even he was dull in this. This movie was crying out for a Jeff Goldblum , Sam Neil or a Richard Attenborough but what we got was a ridiculously over the top Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio. I even wanted the Dinosaurs to eat the kids but we all knew that wasn't going to happen. The only thing i really like about this is who the actual hero in the end is. I thought that was quite clever.

Only one star in the original movie is back, BD Wong as a department head.Special effects are great but the plot needed to be a lot more in development.

The first time I watched it was last year when it first came out and I loved it. And upon viewing it a second time, I still love it. It has great action, characters, dinosaurs and more or less a smart plot. Let us not kid ourselves, we all watched it for the dinosaurs and the action; and that is all fine and good. But people complain about the movie not being as deep and thought provoking as the original film. To those people I say, go back and watch the original movie. Think about it, if they remade this to mirror the original film then it would be boring. Sure, the film does match the original film but it is very much its own movie. Basically, those hating on the film are trying to hate it. The rest of us are just enjoying the show. It isn't rocket science, so just shut up and enjoy the ride.",Jurassic World
124,jadepietro,Let Us Prey,7,12 June 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: Dinosaurs again prey on humans in this enjoyable but very predictable installment.GRADE: BChomp! The sideshow has finally arrived...once again! Thrills await! Step right up and see heroic derdoings! Gaze at the reptilian marvels on display before they are unleashed to the masses wreaking havoc on their prey. Watch damsels-in-distress flee from the monstrous hordes of wizardly lizards. (And man, can she run in high heels!). Witness scenes of spectacular state-of-the-art CGI. The media circus is here as the summer movie season descends with Jurassic World literally leading the pack for your attention and enjoyment. It has been 14 years since the last dinosaur outing of the Spielberg trilogy. This latest installment is not directed by him but he was involved in its making. Now, solidly directed by Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World doesn't earn its rightful pedigree like its more original and innovative source, but it qualifies as delirious sloppy seconds in its earnestness to create scares and its ability to entertain.There is no sly wit, no clever banter, no memorable set pieces (like in the classic kitchen sequence with the Raptors in the original Jurassic Park). It just one chase scene after the next with no character development in sight. But the action is good and somewhat suspenseful. The dinosaurs are real and lifelike, especially compared to their human counterparts.Chris Pratt takes on his Indiana Jones role with much charm and bravado. Bryce Dallas Howard has the thankless stereotypical role of the icy career woman who will thaw out once she gets her man. Vincent D'Onofrio is all caricature, a cartoon villain and nothing more. Only Nick Robinson, Judy Greer, and Jake Johnson bring some nuance to their one-dimensional characters. Basically, the rest of the actors are just pawns to a weak script. They are there solely as appetizers for the scaly inhabitants of the island. The biggest shock is that this screenplay-by-committee was created by a quartet of writers (including the director) who were all unable to bring any depth or logic to this lamest of stories. The set-up is so formulaic from all of its other versions, even down to its incompatible couple and two children in peril.At best, the film lampoons our insatiable need for ""more"" thrills and targets our self-serving theme park mentality of instant gratification. Yet in so many scenes, product endorsements with the likes of Coca-Cola, Pandora, and Mercedes-Benz become glaringly blatant and lumber in gargantuan proportions that rival T Rex. One character in the film aptly states about the public's taste for entertainment, ""We want it bigger and louder...and with more teeth."" That may sum up our movie-going appetite as well. This upgraded fourth generation of dino-thrills may certainly possess two of the former descriptive terms, but it's in the latter category in which the film has no bite. Jurassic World, while still fun, is a bit toothless.",Jurassic World
125,Seraphion,Nice action-thriller and lived up to the spirit of the original movies,7,17 June 2015,"Two brothers Zach and Gray are sent by their parents to have a vacation at the dinosaur theme park Jurassic World, which has opened for quite some time despite the horrible failure of Jurassic Park some twenty years ago. They meet with their aunt Claire, a high ranking employee of the park, but Claire leaves them with her assistant due to her businesses. Claire meets her boss Misrani and they oversee the newly genetically engineered dinosaur Indominus Rex which is staged to be the new attraction for the park. With a body twice the size of a T-Rex, Indominus shows signs of high intelligence. On the other side of the park, Owen Grady works as a tamer for a pack of raptors. An InGen man Hoskins approaches him with a purpose of weaponizing the pack, to Owen's rejection saying that the pack is still largely an uncharted territory. Yet when a co-worker accidentally falls into the raptor cage, Owen nicely displays his command of the pack, at least not to eat the both of them.Claire meets Owen, persuading him to try to tame Indominus for the park, much to Owen's rejection, saying that it's impossible especially if the conditions are compared to the raptors. When Claire brings Owen to the Indominus' cage, the dinosaur tricked them into entering the cage and leaving the gates weak. Indominus wreaks havoc through the gates, claiming lives of the cage keepers, with Owen barely escaping the dinosaur's jaws. Park security personnel dispatched to handle Indominus also rendered dead when it's found that it can change skin color and avoid thermal detection. The next thing destroyed in the dinosaur's path is the old aviary where the park holds the flying dinosaurs, also claiming Misrani's life. The flying dinosaurs come to the visitor area and wreak havoc to the civilians. Seeing Misrani's absence, Hoskins and InGen take over the park's control, insisting Owen to bring his raptors to hunt Indominus.The hunting party catches up to Indominus, when it simply communicates with the raptors, then assuming the position of the pack's alpha. The hunting party gets to be hunted, with Owen, Claire, Zach and Gray barely escaping. The retreat to the visitor area where there's only security personnel. The four get caught by the raptors. But Owen manages to sway the pack into his command again. The pack attacks Indominus, but it's not enough. Claire makes herself as a bait, luring the park's T-Rex out to fight Indominus. But this too proves insufficient. They all catch their luck when the dinosaur battle between the T-Rex and the raptors against Indominus gets dragged to beside the Mosasaur pool, where the gigantic marine dinosaur snaps from its aquatic habitat and bites the Indominus by the neck and drowns it to be its food.The story really tried very hard to be something different. It seems like the movie really tried to get out of the common generalization. This way makes the movie instead builds up a little bit too slow at the beginning, showing too much of the brothers' family than the actual park. And strangely, when the park is actually shown, the movie just happily jumps right back into the usual recipe for these kind of scientific action thriller movies; show a dazzling world with potential dangers, show a new yet risky change to that world, and let the risk happens by itself and the action begins.Yet despite the story being so predictable and all, the movie still has many plus points it can brag about. The most important is the really nice thriller sets it has here and there. The piece with the raptors, which has already been shown on the trailers look very tense at the actual movie, so did the piece where the two kids are trapped inside the gyroscopic ball with a dinosaur up their butts. The action sequences, instead, are not really that great in overall in this movie. The night time raptor-truck chase sequence couldn't really top the original movies' T-Rex-jeep chase sequence. The fact that most of the action took place at night really didn't help at all.The CGI and VFX however, is one amazing job in overall. They really took care of nice details in bringing back animatronics for the scenes of kids in the baby-dino zoo. The Mosasaur is also quite a spectacle. What tops it all for me is how the movie places the camera in Kate's Pterodactyl ordeal. The acting overall is a great job in my view. Chris Pratt, being at home with this kind of character like what he did in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) brings the sanguine persona devoid from the previous Jurassic Park movies. Bryce Dallas Howard did okay in balancing the movie with the alternate perspective of the park. Casting Vincent D'Onofrio as the side threat is a great thing the movie had. It made the threat side more significant and not only focused on the dinosaurs.For me Jurassic World (2015) deserves a fair 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to see in the cinemas. For action-thriller junkies or junkies or just those people who grew up watching the original movies like me, I think the movie will worth your money. Besides bringing back the nostalgic awe of dinosaurs, the movie succeeded in being suspenseful at the action-thriller parts.",Jurassic World
126,rgkarim,Welcome Back To The World:,8,11 June 2015,"The year is 1993, you go to the theater for Dinosaurs and get the thrill of your life watching humans run from mega sized monsters with the urge to kill. Spielberg's classic Jurassic Park instilled in us a sense of wonder, excitement, and for some of us nightmares as the monsters devoured our cast. Following that, the series hit some rough patches that while visually impressive, lacked the quality the first one did. After a fourteen year hiatus, a fourth installment has finally emerged from the primordial soup to bring us back into the adventure. Tonight I review Jurassic World, so let's jump into the excitement and see if it lives up to hype. Jurassic World reintroduces the park, which has been upgraded with the latest toys of the modern era. This installment brings us back into the excitement of the park, as you become part of the crowd and experiencing the exhibits first hand. Stunning CGI visuals have once more brought the prehistoric monsters to life, animated beautifully to parade about the park. While not as realistic in terms of textures as the animatronic cousins from the 90's, this reviewer was impressed at the detail they put into making Jurassic World pop off the screen. You've seen most of the magic unfold already on the trailers, but trust me that there is still plenty of sights to behold on the big screen. Seeing the Mosasaur leap out of the water, or watching the terrifying Indominus Rex storm across the fields, the terror you felt back in the day returns with it. When combined with the special effects and sound editing, the scenes are even more thrilling and immersive, so much that you forget you are even watching a movie. The visuals aren't the only thing that will have you reminiscing back to the original trilogy though. No my friends there are plenty of tributes paid in Jurassic World that had me smiling in delight. It's obvious the design team went back to the roots to craft this adventure, (finally), and managed to pull some of the best qualities from World's predecessors, such as locations, kills, and plot elements, and put a new twist on them. Most of the twists often have are involve action, exciting moments where the orchestra's melodies booming over speakers as our heroes strive to survive. Yes, you read right, Jurassic World is certainly not boring or slow, with almost the entire two hours thrilling in some aspect. And believe it or not the filming and editing itself is on target as well. Camera work is stable, all details captured to maximize the carnage and chaos of the digital images while also capturing the emotions of our group. While most of the movie is action, don't think that is the only thing you will get in this movie. Amidst the excitement are plenty of touching, emotionally heavy moments that are sure to move you in some way. Some of the scenes involving the dinosaurs and Chris Pratt's character had me almost tearing up, while other times I rolled my eyes at the preachy messages they painstakingly made. Fortunately there is humor thrown into the mix that had me laughing more times than not. Most of the comedy was intentional, some of the dialog timed at just the right moment to break the tension. Some of the jokes were a little pushed on me, but I must say that overall it works, especially with Pratt leading the group in his dynamic ways. The emotional spectrum is well done in this film, and goes back to all the aspects of the first one you love. Like always though there are some pieces to this movie that aren't all there. First off the build up in the park wasn't there for me in the film. Normally there is an epic buildup to the inevitable dinosaur busting out to hunt, but this film didn't have quite that much thrill that I was looking for. Things progressed too fast before the crap hit the fan, it did leave me a little disappointed. That minor point aside there are times where the ridiculousness of Jurassic World gets stretched a bit much, and no I don't mean the raptor training bit that actually worked. Sure this is a movie where dinosaurs are no longer extinct, but there are a few moments that are a little too stretched or hard to swallow, but again this is a minor moment. The major weakness to this movie is how predictable it is. World's plot writing team really laid out the plot of this movie in the first half hour such as: who would die, how they would die, and how the problem would resolve itself. Thus you can guess I wasn't too terrified or surprised by most of the moments in this movie, though there were some nice surprises. I don't think this will be a problem for most, but this reviewer has to dock some points for this weakness. Jurassic Word is on point as my friend would say, and is a great reintroduction into Crichton's world. That excitement you felt visiting the park returns once more, and despite the lack of suspense build up, the tale has a much better story than I expected. It certainly is one of the Action/Adventure movies I've seen in a while, and the visual effects are certainly worthy of a big screen visit. Do you see it in 3-D? I can't answer what it did for the movie, but the 2-D movie was certainly great. So my recommendation is go see it soon. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0",Jurassic World
127,Movie-ManDan,"Despite Clichés and Predicability, The Movie Still Rocked!",10,13 June 2015,"I knew right from the get-go that this would not be as good as the original 1993 masterpiece. The only thing I wondered was if it would be in the same league. Although not as good, it is inferior by little. Although not a masterpiece, I call it a ""near-masterpiece"" like The Outsiders and The Aviator.This is the first Jurassic movie where the theme park is actually open and tourists check it out. This does a great job in capturing what it would look like if there actually was a dinosaur park. Lex and Tim are not in it and the two brothers that plays the main kids are much inferior and stereotypes of modern kids. I couldn't help but laugh at them. They weren't dumb, but not good either. It was a flaw I liked and let fly by. Chris Pratt is a raptor-tamer who is also a stereotypical sensitive hero. He is no Sam Neill or Jeff Goldblum, but I had a similar reaction to him as I did with Neill and Goldblum. Bryce Dallas Howard is the the most realistic and multilayer ed character as one of the park's heads. She is the boys' aunt and becomes Pratt's girl. The relationship between the two is a dead giveaway. So the characters are flawed, but still likable.The actual story is a bit worse than the characters. The scientists try to breed different dinosaurs together to make really cool new kinds. Why? To build up tourists. Dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years and have been alive again for over 20 years in the movie. What kind of person would get bored seeing dinosaurs? It would take about 100 years for humans to get bored with dinosaurs. Even if it were true, look at renowned animal parks like Marine Land. They have regular animals but it's always wonderful to see. But the scientists wanting a new kind of dinosaur was cool. The new dinosaur they make is actually pretty cool, kinda like Godzilla. It escapes and everybody must evacuate. It becomes a regular monster movie from there, with every cliché in the book being thrown at you. At least the clichés were taken advantage of. There's lots of suspense built around and jump scares that were mastered. When the dinosaurs raise hell and battle each other, it feels like you're a kid watching a cartoon special. The movie pretty much is a cartoon special since most dinosaurs are noticeably computers.So despite the lack of wow and wide range of emotions that 1993's gave and having forgivable flaws, Jurassic World is one of the year's best.3.5/4",Jurassic World

Its actually good to see a continuation of the things we love instead of heartless reboots, made for merchandise.Starting over with a new park really feels like the way to go, and allowing corporate interference to be the catalyst to this movie's disaster sequence.The animals are all done super well, even if they're not the practical masterpieces of the original movie. The Indominus Rex remind me of a big killer dog, which helps turn down some of the graphic quality of the violence for me.Its definitely worth the watch, and (Pratt racing raptors aside) I'm actually excited just writing about it.",Jurassic World

Sure, it has its windfalls, but who cares? This movie has plenty of dinosaurs, action, and plain fun!!!",Jurassic World
130,Rob_Taylor,Jurassic World complete with equally ancient clichés!,7,11 July 2015,"So, I liked this movie, but boy is it full of clichés and stereotypes. My partner and I found ourselves calling out every character, what they would end up doing within moments of being introduced to them.Seriously, there is an entire butcher's-worth of ham-fistedness in the approach to character intro's and scene building here. You'll know what will happen long in advance of it actually happening on screen.What this does is make the movie utterly predictable and, in essence, boring. At your first viewing, you will feel like you have seen it before.It also says something about a film featuring dinosaurs that it is at its best when they aren't on screen. I don't know how this came about, but, for the most part, the dino's are a little dull and uninteresting. They plod, they run, they roar, and all in glorious CGI. Yet they fail to evoke the same emotions that they did in JP1 or even 2.That's not to say the human actors are a lot better, but at least they have some thin characterisation applied to them, even if it is in the form of horrible stereotyping.I mean, military guy who is bent on weaponizing the dinos, distant aunt who has no skill with children (bet you can't guess where her story-arc evolves to?) What? Oh yeah, that's right... she does discover her nurturing instincts. Wow! You're better at this than the writers!Don't get me wrong. It is a solid popcorn flick. But the lazy writing does it tremendous harm. I swear they have some sort of software in Hollywood that churns this stuff out. There are no surprises here. None.Acting and Effects are capable. No one really stinks and there aren't that many obvious CGI moments (in so much as we know it is all CGI anyway, nothing shows itself about the perceptual parapet, as it were).It is a decent watch, but expecting the expected is no longer fun when taken to this extreme.SUMMARY: Formulaic and totally predictable. Nothing to write home about. See it, and then move on.",Jurassic World
131,bobbysing,"Its predictable following a set formula, yet well-made and engaging in its second hour providing the expected excitement.",7,2 August 2016,"To tone down the expectations level first, it's admittedly impossible to relive those startling moments, excitement and thrill of witnessing the giant dinosaurs on the silver screen for the first time ever (two decades back) with Steven Spielberg's out of the world vision of Jurassic Park amazing the entire world. So moving ahead of any such comparisons, the world of dinosaurs is back after almost a decade of its last sequel, especially inviting the young viewers eager to witness the phenomenon in theatres (in 3D) for the very first time after having seen all its earlier parts on the smaller screen through their home video discs. Having said that, this fourth instalment of the series thankfully holds some novel surprises for the not so young viewers too featuring one of our own talented actors Irrfan Khan in a significant and much bigger role as the owner of the beautiful amusement park.In short, realising the pressure to deliver the content conceived in the time of much better CGI and VFX as compared to the last three parts, JURASSIC WORLD doesn't disappoint and comes up as a fairly entertaining joyride with many fresh attractions in its kitty to excite one and all.Co-written and directed by Colin Trevorrow, this time we have a much bigger and stunning theme park with the main attraction of a new genetically modified, extra ordinarily intelligent hybrid dinosaur called Indominus Rex. The killing machine gets introduced with a fine build-up along with the four terrifying raptors tamed by their brave trainer. And then we have a gigantic water beast too brought in with a terrific public show sequence providing the much expected thrills.Following a set pattern that's predictable right from the word go, the first half of the film is a visual delight establishing the new characters of two young brothers, their aunt who is the manager of the park, their ultimate savior and the owner trying to show the world some unbelievable creations of his hired scientists. Not much happens in terms of action in this first hour taking you on to the tour of this much advanced park and the tension actually begins when the dangerous Rex manages to escape from its specified secured area to kill every living being found in its way ahead.As expected its the second half that has the entire action, thrills and fights between the man and the animal also showcasing hundreds of flying creatures attacking, terrorizing and killing the visitors of the park unlike any other sequel in the past. And that indeed turns the film into a much more bloody and brutal sequel in comparison. The deadly fight between the Rex and the raptors makes the young viewers cheer and the CGI department just executes it perfectly. However, the forcibly added romance element in the script is just there to generate some lighter moments and it's the sheer predictability of the script that doesn't let you rate it as something really outstanding ending on the same repetitive note as usual.In the performances, Chris Pratt superbly plays the character of Owen with great conviction and Bryce Dallas is fine too in her given role along with the two kids. But its Irrfan Khan who gives you a pleasant surprise in probably the biggest role ever played by an Indian actor in a foreign film with such an elegant ease. Interestingly another life teaching fact about his association with the series is that, the man who once had no money in his pocket to watch the first part of JURASSIC PARK in the 90s, can presently be seen playing the owner of the park in its latest sequel of 2015 after two decades. Personally speaking, this certainly is one of the most amazing play of DESTINY I have ever seen till date.Summing up, Colin Trevorrow's JURASSIC WORLD is surely a must watch for every youngster who hasn't experienced the famous dinosaur show in the big theatre ever before (preferably in 3D). Plus it has enough in store for the grown-ups too with new inventions especially incorporated for this particular section of viewers expecting something fresh. Yet, one would have to keep the comparisons out of the mind to enjoy it in a much better way taking along the kids to this 'wonderful show of dinosaurs' invented by Spielberg, Trevorrow and their exceptionally talented team designing the incredible graphics.",Jurassic World
132,Sandcooler,Gives the audience what it wants,8,7 July 2015,"""Jurassic World"" doesn't really work as a sequel to ""Jurassic Park"", and barely works as a homage. It does however work as a great dumb blockbuster, and I think by this point in the franchise everyone's willing to settle for that. It's a brainless popcorn flick, the kind where the villain is someone who thinks uncontrollable prehistoric monsters can be made into weapons and little kids quip ""I can't wait to tell mom!"" two seconds after they escaped a gruesome death. Speaking of gruesome deaths, this movie is chock full of them. The script to the original was obviously a lot better, but this one has almost non-stop action, a surprising amount of variation and a truly dazzling climax. The clumsy set-up of the inevitable love subplot was even a bit too dumb for me (the first dialogue between Claire and Owen is the most forced exposition you'll ever see), but apart from that I was entertained throughout.",Jurassic World
133,pc95,Shameless Money Grab,3,20 November 2015,"Certainly one the worst big-budget movies this year, ""Jurassic World"" is recycled, rehashed and devoid of intelligence. I can't recall the other predecessor movies (Jurassic Park and it's mediocre to poor sequels) even as bad as this pond scum. The product placement is gratiutious and shameful. - Mercedes, Coca-cola, Imax etc....There is bloat-scenes all over the place - pure filler fat. The lack of intelligence of this movie is remarkable considering the its budget. Dialog is utterly PG tepid. Scene after scene of stink with inane fighting supposedly of security men skirmishing with predators. Half- hearted limp character development fizzles out within the first 20 min.

The special effects were basically in line with expectations, and the last two Tyrannosaurus Rex had a much worse battle. The plot, as always, is a collection of no Zuo no die. Of course, there will be a lot of loopholes. The space reserved for the sequel looks small. Finally, Tucao only receives 20 thousand of the parks, and is not afraid of Chinese tourists.",Jurassic World
135,vengeance20,A great entry into the franchise,8,11 June 2015,"Having only seen large segments of the original 1993 Jurassic Park film & not the other installments I'd have to say seeing this in 3D was pretty kick-arse considering it took them nearly 15 years to make this film which from what I've read has been in development hell since 2004/2005 time.Not a die hard fan of the franchise myself. I found this to be a pretty satisfying film with great effects & scenes which delivered some intense & slightly bloody moments which I quite liked! The part where the dinosaur bursts out of the water & eats the shark was one of my favourite sequences!The ending was pretty good too, but I won't spoil it for you as it was pretty epic & reminded me of Lake Placid 4 abit.I overall would give this film a 8/10 it was decent film with great effects & action!",Jurassic World
136,WeAreLive,I love this movie more please,10,15 October 2017,"This movie was incredible. I have to admit I have never seen any of the Jurrasic Park movies and when they came on TV I got scared when I was younger. I have to say this movie with Chris Pratt was incredible, I couldn't believe it took me two years to see this movie because of how scared I was when I was 15 but now I am 17 and I am not scared.Wheather if you have grown up with the Jurrasic Park movies or not I can guarantee you this that you will love this movie.I hope the sequel to this movie which is coming out next year is successful like this movie is.",Jurassic World
137,brando647,It Wasn't What I Hoped; Shallowly Entertaining,8,28 March 2016,"The original JURASSIC PARK is and always will be one of my favorite movies. I even enjoyed THE LOST WORLD more than most people. I've read Michael Crichton's novels more times than I can remember. So yes, I am a fan. I wasn't thrilled at the idea of reopening the movie franchise more than a decade since the third film solidified my belief that the series had run out of steam. I was cautiously optimistic when I read that Colin Trevorrow, director of the fun SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED, was brought on to helm the project and I was even more excited when Chris Pratt was cast in one of the lead roles. Trevorrow was loud and proud about his love for the original '93 film, so I began to believe he might do the series justice and somehow reinvigorate it. JURASSIC WORLD seems to ignore the previous two sequels, setting it in an operational and mega-successful park built on Isla Nublar. Claire (Bryce Dallas-Howard) is the operations manager, whom we meet when she's balancing a busy schedule of shuffling off her visiting nephews onto her disinterested assistant and presenting the park's newest attraction, the Indominus Rex, to potential investors. Meanwhile, former Navy SEAL and Ingen contractor Owen (Pratt) takes a break from training a team of velociraptors to inspect the Indominus's pen for safety concerns; in what should come as a surprise to no one, the Indominus outsmarts Owen and the park crew and escapes from its pen, endangering the lives of thousands of park guests as it murders its way across the island.Trevorrow was not lying when he expounded on his love for the original film. In fact, JURASSIC WORLD is his love letter to it and it's probably the film's biggest flaw. You can't go more than a few minutes without some sort of reference to JURASSIC PARK. The visitors' center is featured in a sequence where we see the ""When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth"" and skeletal remains from the climactic moment. We see a night vision headset (twice!), famous from the T-rex escape sequence. There's little nods scattered around in the background (visual and audio) and even a character in the Jurassic World control room (Lowery, played by Jake Johnson) who seems to encapsulate Trevorrow's own raging fandom. A few references would've been fine but, by the time the film was halfway over, it just made me wish I was watching the original film. I wanted JURASSIC WORLD to be its own film, reminding us why we loved the '93 film without constantly nudging us with its elbow, winking, and murmuring ""Remember that part? It was cool, wasn't it?"" Even the core plot is pretty much a slightly modified version of the original: dinosaurs get loose, rational man who knows what he's doing makes it his mission to bring two key children back to safety, big climactic moment to close it out. Except the characters in the original film always felt as if they were in constant danger. There was suspense. JURASSIC WORLD isn't all that suspenseful. Maybe it's because the dinosaurs are 99% CG now. Sure, they look pretty good but, no matter how many people the Indominus swallows whole, it's never as scary as the T-rex was in the first film. The lack of suspense could also be attributed to the hollow feeling behind the action. Most of the deaths are nameless extras, be they asset containment crew or park guests. The moment when I knew this would never live up to JURASSIC PARK: when a helicopter crashes in a fiery, gratuitous, unmotivated explosion just so it can happen with the Indominus roaring in the foreground for that perfect ""trailer shot"". It was almost offensive in how cheesy that moment felt.Speaking of cheesyhow about that final confrontation with the Indominus? I'm not going to lie. That whole sequence had me rolling my eyes. Especially at the end. Not going to spoil anything here, but you'll probably know what I'm referring to. I'm being sort of hard on JURASSIC WORLD but that's only because I wanted it to try harder. It's not a bad film. It's still pretty entertaining. It's got some great casting (Pratt, Johnson, Irrfan Khan as the park owner, Vincent D'Onofrio as a nefarious Ingen overseer) and I loved the concept of setting the film in an operational park. On the topic of D'Onofrio's character and the whole subplot of ""trained"" velociraptors: I was wary at first but I thought it was done well. If anything, I think it should've been the main plot the film or, at the very least, saved for a sequel. The sequence in the middle of the film where the raptors are given a field test (which is glimpsed in the trailer with Pratt running with the pack on a motorcycle) was probably the best part of the movie. Overall, I felt JURASSIC WORLD was a tad overrated and, while it was an entertaining couple of hours, teamed with AGE OF ULTRON to jumpstart the ""Summer of 'Meh'"" (a term I've come to use for the summer blockbuster season of 2015 where I was continuously underwhelmed). Based on the money this film raked in (all of it), a sequel was guaranteed and, just as I was for JURASSIC WORLD, I'm hopeful. This spent too much time pining over the franchise's glory days but there were some promising nuggets in there. For anyone who for some reason hasn't seen it already, it's worth a watch and you'll probably really enjoy it. Personally, I'm more interested in where the franchise goes from here.",Jurassic World
138,moviewizguy,A Jurassic Park for a Modern Audience,6,12 June 2015,"JURASSIC WORLD is sooooooo stupid. Every situation the characters are in is due to their stupidity or the stupidity of someone else. Remember in JURASSIC PARK​ when there were smart people who found themselves in an extraordinary situation beyond their control? Nevertheless, the fact that there were many moments where I either gasped in awe or terror is a testament to how freaking awesome dinosaurs are and how much we've missed seeing them in almost 15 years. The nostalgia is strong with this one, although some callbacks to the original film feel obvious and cloying.However, the climax is pretty damn wonderful. It's the one thing I can safely say made me feel like a kid again. Additionally, Chris Pratt is great (no surprise there). He's the best actor in here, but it's too bad the supporting characters are either expendable or aren't developed enough. Oh, well.... JURASSIC WORLD ain't no JURASSIC PARK. The CGI is apparent, and there aren't a lot of practical effects (I can count only one scene). It's a film for a modern audience, and I'm not saying that to be cynical. There's literally a scene where Bryce Dallas Howard's character says that outright. Overall, it's a dumb, fun movie for the most part. Just leave your brain at the door because you won't be using it. You'll regret it if you do.",Jurassic World

140,moviexclusive,"The best yet since the original, this reboot 22 years after is a non-stop thrill ride with pleasantly surprising doses of good humor and warm nostalgia",7,10 June 2015,"Let's cut to the chase – for those of you who just want to know if 'Jurassic World' is as good as 'Jurassic Park', the answer is no, but it does come pretty damn close. To be fair, it was going to be a tall order to top the Steven Spielberg original, a fact which the revamped park's own management, owner Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and his right-hand woman Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), readily acknowledge. It isn't enough that we are seeing dinosaurs come alive before us; in order to dazzle, the animals has got to be ""bigger, louder, and more teeth"". And so in their quest to create a new attraction for the park, its chief scientist Dr Henry Wu (B.D. Wong, the only cast member from 'Jurassic Park' to reprise his role) turns to genetic modification to create varieties that never existed 65 billion years ago. That research has yielded the Indominous Rex, a hybrid whose DNA is based off a T- Rex and is spliced with the genome of other species which we slowly learn (the hard way) of its predatory functions. Bred miles away from the actual visitors' areas, it sets a trap to bait its breeders into its paddock and, during the ensuing mêlée, breaks out of the enclosure to wreck havoc not just to the humans on the Isla Nubar but also the rest of its own kind living on the island.With the Indominous Rex on the loose, ex-Navy man Owen (Chris Pratt) springs into action to try to stop the beast before it reaches the 20 thousand over blissfully unaware visitors and at the same time rescue two kids (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson), who happen to be Claire's nephews, that are in imminent danger after veering off the beaten course. Save for a little spot of complication from the corporation's head of security, Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), whose idea to employ raptors against the Indominous Rex backfires in a jaw-dropping 'oh sh*t' moment, the narrative unfolds in as linear and straightforward a manner as you can imagine.Not that we're complaining – despite crediting four writers, 'Jurassic World' is supposed to be a movie built on thrill and spectacle more than anything else, a fact that isn't lost on its director Colin Trevorrow. Despite having only one other feature- length movie to his credit, Trevorrow proves more than able to construct riveting action set-pieces that are keystone to the franchise. Among the highlights – Masrani's attempt to take down the Indominous Rex from a helicopter that comes to a fiery end and sets free the winged predators held captive in an aviary, the birds' subsequent attack on the hordes of visitors in the main theme park, and the raptors' hunt for the Indominous Rex that takes a surprising turn.Just about the last hour and a half is packed wall-to-wall with non- stop action, as the characters run, duck, hide, chase, rinse and repeat in order to save their own and prevent a bigger calamity from shutting down the park forever. Trevorrow lacks Spielberg's gift for creating and sustaining tension, but in place of iconic moments like the ripples in the glass of water on the dashboard or the velociraptors opening a kitchen door, he simply keeps the action going and going, pausing only to a) let in a kicker and/or b) pay tribute to his predecessors. That said, it is to us also the reason why this entry pales in comparison to Spielberg's original, which was a quintessential masterpiece in choreographed suspense.Rightfully, Trevorrow shows the utmost respect for the establishing blocks of the franchise. Although the theme park has undergone a major makeover with snazzy new attractions like a dinosaur petting zoo, an amphitheater featuring a monosaurus feeding show and face- to-face safari-like dino excursions in a circular self-powered vehicle called a gyro-sphere, there are constant nods to the original movie. The original Jurassic Park Visitors Centre makes a pleasantly surprising appearance midway into the film, and for that matter so does its banner and T-shirts. Most significantly, the finale pays homage to the first movie in truly cheer-worthy rah-rah fashion – and while we will agree with the cynics that it is deus ex machina, there is no denying that it closes the film on a high note.Though this is the first chapter in the series to introduce a whole new set of characters, they are well written and well played enough to compensate for any nostalgia one may have of Dr Alan Grant or Dr Ian Malcolm. Pratt's good-natured charisma rubs off amply on his character, and Howard manages to go from unlikeable to someone we care about with surprising clarity. Most delightful however is the sibling dynamic between Simpkins and Robinson, which provides much of the film's emotional anchor; indeed, it is from their perspective that we are brought into the titular resort, and whose survival we come to fear the most for.Back in the day, the Steven Spielberg original was the very definition of blockbuster entertainment, especially in how it so seamlessly fused CGI with animatronics to create awe-inspiring renditions of the beasts that once walked our earth. Like we said at the beginning, it is probably too much to ask that 'Jurassic World' has that same effect on us, but it is also the only entry thus far to come close to replicating that experience. The effects are obviously leaps and bounds over the 1993 game-changer, such that what was real feels even more so now. It is also a non-stop edge-of-your- seat thrill ride, one that hits the high gear even before the halfway mark and never lets up. You bet you'll be humming that John Williams theme song as you step out of the theater, and if you ain't awe-struck, we guarantee that it will still leave you breathless.",Jurassic World
141,quincytheodore,"Inheriting all the good traits of the franchise, Jurassic World is a worthy successor",8,10 June 2015,"I had fond memories for Jurassic Park, it is one of the first movies I watched. The sense of novelty back then was near magical, so expectation was high for this new installment. Jurassic World is basically reincarnation of the first two titles. Utilizing grand spectacle and cheeky nostalgia factor it succeeds in capturing the essence of the franchise. It may be predictable and frankly not as awe-inspiring as the first, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable film for both old and new audiences.The plot remains the same, they put dinosaurs on display and wait until human hubris ruins everything. We all know what will happen, and there's not much cerebral twist or groundbreaking narrative. Safe to say it plays to its strength without revolutionizing the genre, which is all right. It has great production value to deliver what had already worked on capturing audience's imagination.Visual takes a very familiar approach, not only on subtle details or atmosphere, you can literally see intentional throwbacks to past glory. Wardrobes such as Chris Pratt's shirt and vest or Bryce Howard's blouse and tanktop, which admittedly look good on her, are incredibly similar to previous characters' features. Nifty tidbits are reinvented with more futuristic design, in some scenes the film almost channels Jurassic Park's spirit.Acting is pretty upfront for blockbuster movie. Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard deliver the leading roles as expected. They are capable and their chemistry is adequately presentable, thanks to a few timely humors. Supporting characters like Irrfan Khan's billionaire persona and the two new kids are decent as well. The kids in particular are not exact carbon copy of Hammond's grandkids, I admit I had assumed them as such, they perform enough with material at hand to differentiate themselves.Vincent D'Onofrio, on the other hand, is not really fully utilized. After his brilliant performance in Daredevil, or his entire career for that matter, it's a bit underwhelming to see him as typical corporate role. The movie also has several questionable parts, these feel a bit forced to move things along. They consist of on-screen poor decisions and anomalies, though they are not major enough to derail the movie.Second half presents everything audience would want from a film with Jurassic in its title. The scenes are incredible, full with continuous shots of the creatures in spectacular view. It capitalizes on the momentum towards the latter half with rapid crazy sequences. If you like something from previous titles, chances are you'll find it here.Jurassic World is not the next step of cinematic evolution, it is the epitome of spiritual successor. It inherits the good attributes and presents them in fresh dramatic exhibition, and it is more than enough to entertain.",Jurassic World
142,Sergeant_Tibbs,"A big dumb shiny movie, and for the most part, that's just fine.",6,15 July 2015,"Yeah, Jurassic World is a hot mess. In development since the third left theaters and despite a barrage of criticisms and little hope after the various trailers and clips we were shown - ranging from sexism to inadequate CGI - Spielberg's juggernaut franchise still managed to slay the box office and take over the world. It's nearing the top 30 adjusted box office ever now. That's pretty much the most Jurassic World has got going for it. It's an event movie, and that's all it feels like. The best reaction the film has gotten is calling it the best Jurassic Park sequel, which while true, isn't saying much to its quality. At the very least, it pays off something we've been waiting for 20 years. We get to see the park in operation, including many inventive ride concepts. The resemblance to Universal Studios is uncanny and wholly deliberate I'm sure, but admission for the movie feels like a discount for the theme park. Its first act of nostalgic awe is pretty wonderful, if utterly superficial but I can't call it hollow.The film may only have cheap surprises up its sleeve, but it's not short on entertainment value. Yes, it has trappings of today's action sequences of impossible camera moves that hint at how green their screens are, but it's fun to watch. Characters are indeed one- dimensional and it gives us little reason to invest in them besides the fact that if they don't act now they'll be mangled and/or eaten. It does have many contrivances to get them in or out of danger, but they're facing dinosaurs, a contrivance is the only way in or out. I wish Chris Pratt could have more opportunity to put his goofy charm on that made Guardians of the Galaxy so endearing, but here's it's more stoic badass. Among the clichés, it does get to explore a few interesting things that the first didn't have time to touch on, such as the morality of using dinosaurs as weapons. Those few moments reveal that it does have more intentions than money. Otherwise, of course Jurassic World is a big dumb shiny movie. It could be worse.6/10",Jurassic World
143,Terryfan,Welcome To Jurassic World,10,14 June 2015,"At last! It felt like it would never come but like the old saying ""Never say never"". I grew up with Jurassic Park and Dinosaurs were a huge part of my life.And after hearing the news in late 2014 that my wish was finally coming true it is just thrill me that after Fourteen years Jurassic was returning. Under the new title Jurassic World but watching the film you will understand why it is called Jurassic World. What makes the movie even better was seeing it with family, I saw Jurassic World early this morning in theaters with my older brother my two younger nieces and my dad it's always better to go to the movies with those you enjoy seeing movies with and it was worth the ticket to go see Jurassic World in a jammed packed theater. I'm not kidding it was full to the max only a few seat were able to get to. It is also one of the best movie thrill rides you have seen in a long time. Now I want to make something understandable I want everyone to go see this movie and it will be as spoiler free as possible for this review It was the vision that John Hammond wanted for Jurassic Park and it became a real theme park on the island where it all begin 20 years before on Isla Nublar. We are also given a new cast of characters and actors. We have Owen Grady played by Chris Pratt who has become one of my favorite actors lately and he was very good in this film as the main protagonist when I learn he was cast in the role I felt we were in good hands with him as the leading actor you could tell he enjoy every bit of the movie and he got to use some clever punch lines. Claire Dearing played by Bryce Dallas Howard who does a good job in this film as she plays the Park's Operations manager and she gets the VIP passes to her nephews Zach and Gray Mitchell played by Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins. They are given a interesting story as their parents Karen and Scott played by Judy Greer and Andy Buckley are the ones who send them to Jurassic World to visit their aunt. Also Vi Hoskins played by Vincent D'Onofrio Head of Security operations for InGen right from the start you can tell this guy was going to be trouble, Barry played by Omar Sky who helps Owen with the rapports, Lowery Cruthers played by Jake Johnson and Vivian played by Lauren Lapkus are also new to the movie the only actor from the films to return is B.D.Wong who reprise his role as Dr.Henry Wu and he serves a lot more to the plot as you will discover.Also a lot of the old favorite Dinosaurs are back, we get Stegosauurs, Apatosaurus, Ankylosaurus,Pterandon, Triceratops,Velociraptors, and Tyrannosaurus Rex we are also introduce to Monsasauraus and the movie main Dinosaur Antagonist Indominus Rex and this is the hybrid dinosaur the only way to give this animal justice is to go watch it on the big screen she is a real predator. Jurassic World also gives you that nostalgia feel because the music the look of the dinosaurs and the fact it takes place on the same island it just awesome rush plus listening to the music of the film as it plays the themes we know and love about Jurassic Park It made me smile listening to the songs.Also they used animatronics for the dinosaurs because that is how the series started with and it is a respective tribute to the filmsThe cast gave us a very good performance as you watch the film you can tell they each love Jurassic Park and wanted to honor what had made it so great. I along with everyone in the theater appreciate what the cast did for those of us who love the series.Just watching the Dinosaurs on the big screen again was super awesome and they were so cool to see come back to life on the screen they did a good job as they always do with the performance of each DinosaurJurassic World in my opinion really deliver and hit this one way out of the park after waiting for so long it was excellent to see Jurassic World on the big screen One of the few movies I can remember where everyone in the theater gave a movie a round of applause. If you love Dinosaurs and Jurassic Park then you must go see Jurassic World and spare no expenseWith a good cast, tense action and the return of the Dinosaurs you will have to see it twice to take it all inI give Jurassic World an 10 out of 10!",Jurassic World
144,MartianOctocretr5,Wrestling from Isla Nublar,8,15 June 2015,"Most everybody agrees that the 2nd and especially the 3rd of the Jurassic installments were anemic rehashes of the wild show the original Jurassic Park was. So bad, that they put the genetically engineered dinosaurs on the endangered species list. This return saves the franchise, although there are some blemishes in scripting that are too noticeable to ignore.First of all, when you go to see a Jurassic Park movie, you're there to see dinosaurs hunting people and smashing stuff to bits, right? It's hardly any mystery that something will go horribly wrong sooner or later either. It was a good device to show the park operating in the manner it's supposed to, and the Sea World/Disneyland touristy feel was the right approach. Still, you can't help but think, ""OK, when do the dinosaurs break out and start chasing everybody?"" The movie does not disappoint where dinosaur violence is concerned. There are plenty of dino-duels and chase scenes. The pterodactyl sequence is executed well. Are there problems? Yes, several. One character has the word ""Dino- meal stamped on his head from the first time you see him. Then there are the clichés that have shown up in every single JP movie now: kids in danger who are in danger because they're dumb and encounter the most dangerous dinosaur, references to a divorce that nobody cares about, an obnoxious corporate twit with a big mouth, a guy plotting to exploit the dinosaurs for his own agenda, and so on. There are some plot holes, especially in the inconsistent behavior of some of the animals. The story gives some character development to the dinosaurs, which usually works except for a couple of glaring and weird exceptions. Human characters really aren't developed too well, and one lead character was horribly miscast. And, whoever cranked out the tired ""cell phones fail just when you need them"" cliché needs to placed under arrest. The story line has a clear destination, and moves well from chapter to chapter.

145,rivertam26,Worthy successor,8,12 June 2015,"A worthy successor to Jurassic Park. Fares much better than the other sequels but lacks the story and character depth of the original masterpiece as well as the its killer suspense. The performances are solid and the direction is decent but a little generic.It however makes up for it with great special effects, fantastic action sequences and an immense amount of bloody dino carnage. At times it can be a bit much but it holds together fairly well and culminates to a ferocious finale that left the audience screaming and clapping. A solid summer thrill ride that does a great job of reinvigorating the franchise but the best advice i can give the makers of the unavoidable follow up is too slow it down a bit. Anticipation makes the proceedings that much more effective.",Jurassic World
146,rivertam26,A worthy follow up,8,15 March 2020,"I think everyone had high expectations walking into this. From all the buzz it was the first great film since the first. With those highs I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed. But its aged well since. Throughout its theatrical run I found a love for the film and started looking at it on it's own terms. Besides sexy and charming Chris Pratt in the lead. Bryce Dallas Howard kicks major butt, the kids are good and the supporting cast are solid. The story is both familiar and refreshing and the FX are pretty spectacular as is the park they have created. In a sense it's sort of a reimagining of the first film and it does a solid job of doing some fun stuff with the treatment. Nothing could ever really come close to Spielberg's masterpiece in my eyes but this does a reputable job of being a solid follow up and the best since the first.Budget: $150m

148,Screen_Blitz,Exciting adventure with dazzling visual effects,6,12 June 2015,"It's been fourteen years since the Jurassic Park franchise came to a halt after it's third installment which was critical failure, but nonetheless a box office hit. By today, very few were expecting to seethe dinosaurs to strike back again for more explosive considering the development hell of the third sequel that is was eventually thrown out. With over decades past since the series debut, many will go into this film and wonder whether or not director Colin Trevrrow and executivep producer Steven Spielberg are able to effectively capture spirit of the predecessor, if not the everlasting nostaglia. Judging by the screenplay and visual effects put to great use, this reboot of the series succeeds at doing both, if a little flawed in it's execution. So goes on this time around? Well, this takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, Jurassic Park has re-opened with dinosaurs who are now genetically modified. Working at the park is operations manager Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) who is scheduled a visit with her two nephews Gray (played by Ty Simpkins) and Zach (played by Nick Robinson, and velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt). What starts off as a fine day of enormous tourism turns into utter chaos when the dinosaurs break loose and causing havoc throughout the park.When it comes to rebooting a classic franchise, it is understandable to be fearful of the spirit and novelty to be lost in a sea of failed ideas. Luckily, this film manages to capture almost same fun and excitement fans experienced 22 years ago when the dinosaurs began chomping and roaring on the silver screen. Though the absence of John Williams' classic score and the direction of Steven Spielberg can be gently felt, they both do little to take away from the endless excitement Colin Trevorrow brings the picture. The anticipated intensity begins not long after our prehistoric creatures break loose from their confined territory and launch a massive onslaught throughout the titular theme park attraction, and thousands of calm tourists are quickly triggered into panic mode running and screaming for their dear lives. These sequences are beautifully brought together in sweet CGI and surface level special effects to dazzle the eyes. But the fun doesn't quite end there. The charisma of Chris Pratt is gracefully brought to the screen often alternating between comic relief and light-hearted heroism. Pratt fits perfectly in this role, and his light-hearted personality he brings to the character is often too likable to ignored.Jurassic World is definitely one of the best films of the summer, and by man means makes for a solid, if slightly undermined return for the Jurassic Park franchise. With the wide plethora of explosive visuals and action sequences the feat the eyes hardcore movie goers everywhere, it is a film destined to see a bright sunshine at the box office.",Jurassic World
149,Troy_Campbell,"Good, but disappointingly not great.",6,16 June 2015,"I'm loath to compare the latest Jurassic sequel with the 1993 Spielberg original, because, quite simply, the latter is a bona fide blockbuster classic that very few can compare with. Even taken on its own, more lenient popcorn-merits though, this CGI-laden dinosaur romp is a bag of liquorice all sorts. On one hand there are some rip-roaring set pieces that evoke a child-like joy, on the other a clutch of embarrassingly corny moments (hello, heroic velociraptor in slow-mo) that should have never made it past the drawing board. For every amusingly tongue-in-cheek line delivered by Chris Pratt's charismatic protagonist, there's an equally dumb plot hole – like a ludicrously stupid creature cameo in the climax – that reeks of a subpar script. The CGI is not as distracting as you might think and provides director Colin Trevorrow with the opportunity to craft a few spectacular sequences, yet there's a disappointing lack of tension and scares on display. The hit and miss output stays true for the eclectic cast. Pratt is affable, Bryce Dallas Howard is steely but likable, Jake Johnson is humorous in full-nerd mode, and Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy add gravitas in small roles; whilst Vincent D'Onofrio is depressingly one-dimensional, and child duo Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are unbearably awkward and bland. An admirable effort to rekindle the dino-magic that falls squarely into the good-but-not-great category, its spate of flaws makes it hard to recommend with confidence.",Jurassic World
150,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"It's nothing new, but still has a good sense of fun, albeit clichéd.",6,30 August 2015,"Jurassic World is literally history repeating itself: we see these people come into this theme park that is the most dangerous type of amusement for human beings, fictional or otherwise: having them interact with dinosaurs created from fossilized mosquito DNA.This is the fourth installment of the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, and quite possibly the stupidest one of the lot: you have Vincent D'Onofrio portraying a villain that's basically every single evil military-minded bad guy from films of the 90s. Oh, and not to get confused with the Marvel connotations at all, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (Guardians of the Galaxy and Spiderman actors respectively) star in this brain-fart of a blockbuster side by side, and have no emotional chemistry most of the time they're on screen.Despite the script being pretty dumb even for blockbuster standards, Colin Trevorrow does a good job at directing an otherwise maniacal story unfold on the screen. It's an entertaining film, but for a movie that broke so many records, it's surprisingly forgettable and disposable compared to other more substantial blockbusters in recent years: The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, and Mad Max: Fury Road just to name a few more substantial films, at least for my taste in movies.Entertaining, but not the kind of blockbuster that will be remembered for generations to come; it's more of a come-and-go kind of film.",Jurassic World
151,pyrocitor,What a wonderful World,9,1 July 2015,"Dinosaurs are timeless.Ironic, perhaps, for creatures branded with the ""65 million years ago"" epitaph, but for centuries dinosaurs have functioned as immediate shorthand to a sense of childlike wonder and awe – sensations Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic capitalized on like few before. But these are not, as some might call them, ""the good ol' days"". In an era supersaturated with things obnoxiously clamouring for our attention, it's no wonder Jurassic World was greenlit based on a pitch predicated on the image of a teenager texting in front of a Tyrannosaurus Rex – it's a blockbuster desperately attempting to conjure up enough excitement to validate its own existence (or, shall I say, to forestall its own extinction). Fronted by Colin Trevorrow, fresh off the modest success of his feature debut, the equally earnest Safety Not Guaranteed, Jurassic World is that rare beast: an ambitious and passionate Hollywood blockbuster that wears its heart on its sleeve, practically imploring its audience to forgo cynicism and eye- rolling, and view the film with the wide-eyed joy of a child. It's a brave move in the recent realm of perennially 'DAAAAAARKNESS, NOOOO PARENTS' blockbusters. And gosh darn it, if it doesn't just pay off, soaring higher than a pterosaur bursting free of its feeble glass aviary. Jurassic World feels like the first natural continuation of the original narrative, flashing- forward from the park being a disastrous pipe dream to the point where it has been open for business long enough for investors to stress about how to wow audiences enough to meet budget quotas. This, naturally, adds a dash of satirical meta-commentary meditating on the film's dual objectives of wowing millions but also generating millions, enough for audiences to briefly feel clever while chowing down on their popcorn. In 1993, you could practically hear Spielberg snickering as he used his own movie's merchandise in the movie itself; here, I dare you not to chuckle at the spot-on ""Verizon presents: the Indominus Rex"". Trevorrow's unabashed reverence for Jurassic The First is clear: each dinosaur species is imbued with painstaking life by impressively naturalistic CGI, and the initial strains of Michael Giacchino's retooling of the iconic theme would be enough to make John Williams himself tear up. Yet, from the opening ""OMG-DINOSAUR-wait-only-a-crow"" jump onwards, it's clear that Trevorrow has mixed a healthy streak of weirdness into his romp in the park. Initially, the tone takes a bit of adjusting to, as the corporate criticism is juxtaposed with the sense of childish wonder permeating the film's script to the point of painting its subject matter, themes, critiques, and even character beats with a curious innocence that verges on the cartoonish at times. Yet, Trevorrow's film is so cheery, taking such broad swipes at it feels akin to kicking a sick triceratops. And by the time the film really kicks into gear with the all- too-familiar sight of a paddock breach, Trevorrow has yanked his audience too far down the rabbit hole of madcap dinosaur fun to fret issues such as plausibility. With the Indominus Rex, Trevorrow has cooked up a movie monster for the ages. Chalk white, screeching, and replete with a laundry list of big-reveal abilities, the Indominus, like her entire movie, would feel too contrived to work if viewers weren't too busy trying to avoid soiling themselves at how genuinely terrifying and awe-inspiring she is. Her escape (a chilling Aliens-pastiche in itself) kicks the film into high gear, sparking some of the most inventively mad action setpieces of many a summer – if you thought the 'Chris Pratt motorcycling through the forest with his raptor buddies' from the trailer looked wacky, just wait to see where it goes from there. Chase follows gunfight follows swooping pterosaurs and leaping mosasaurs, to the point where the action starts to feel puppeteered by a sugar high six-year- old, but, miraculously, this 'so-crazy-it-might-be-awesome' ethos pays off enormously on the big screen. By the time we get to the all-out Deus-Rex-Machina climactic battle – which our theatre gave a standing ovation – the viewer is a child again, firmly revisiting that innocent time when a movie's fun factor could overwhelm the senses, and all was right in the world. Despite the bevy of largely one-note characters, the cast is all game enough to make their presence consistently fun. Chris Pratt, channelling his best Indiana Jones, is less fun and more of a superhero here than in Guardians of the Galaxy, yet retains his peerless charisma, whereas Vincent D'Onofrio shrugs off his nuanced antagonism from this year's Daredevil, beer-gut-strutting and sneering to the point where you want to boo him in the theatre. Unexpectedly, the most compelling character arch goes to Bryce Dallas Howard's stuffy park manager, who fights through a deluge of clichés to emerge as the surprisingly feisty and affecting emotional heart of the film. Ty Simpkins & Nick Robinson balance on just the right side of annoying as the film's requisite kids stranded in the park, even selling a potentially tiresome parental divorce subplot, while Irrfan Khan and Jake Johnson steal laughs aplenty as the park's bombastically over-the-top CEO, and grumbling computer technician (who, sadly, never gets to utter ""Hold onto your butts"") respectively. Jurassic World taps into the core of what a blockbuster should be: high concept, big heart, and with plenty of ""oohs"", ""ahhs"", and ""AHHHHH!!!""s paving the way to what is easily the most fun film of the summer thus far. It seems almost unreasonable that a film juggling so many improbable odds and baggage should be anywhere near as enjoyable. Yet, somehow, life found a way. -8.5/10",Jurassic World
152,Pumpkin_Man,A Great Worthy Nostalgic Sequel That Lives up to the Original!!!,10,13 June 2015,"This sequel was definitely worth the fourteen year wait. It has finally gone back to the basics of the original and stands as a true sequel to the original 1993 Jurassic Park. It's very action-packed, suspenseful, has the right amount of comedy and some great nostalgia for fans of the original. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jake Johnson made great new characters. I became very invested in the characters, and even some of the Dinosaurs. Throughout the majority of the movie, I kept thinking they were missing a great opportunity, and when they hinted at it and it finally happened, I was almost in tears because my wish came true, but I won't dare ruin it for you. Let's just say the final battle is incredibly epic!22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, it has been renamed to Jurassic World and is finally a fully functioning theme park with Dinosaurs, which was John Hammond's vision. The visitor rates are declining, so they make a new genetically modified dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Indominus is probably the meanest toughest smartest Dinosaur throughout the entire Jurassic Park series. Owen Grady (Pratt) tries to hunt it down after it escapes her enclosure. Helping Owen and trying to find her nephews through the havoc is Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager. If you love the series, I highly recommend JURASSIC WORLD!!!",Jurassic World

Pratt and Howard (a fetching Gwen from Spiderman 3) did very well as the two people most involved in handling the mayhem that results when things at your favorite dinosaur park don't go well. Unlike many recent movies, this one did have a soul and didn't just feel like plug-in formula garbage.

157,Stephen_A_Abell,A Jurassic Turkey,4,16 January 2018,"Since the early '90's I've enjoyed the Jurassic Park novels and movies. Not only were they groundbreaking for their special effects but they were intelligent stories, which were well filmed and acted by a stellar cast. I even have to admit to enjoying the third film in the series, which a lot of people have put down. So, when I saw this episode was on the drawing board I was a happy bunny. However, when I saw the cast line up and the story synopsis I decided I'd wait until the film made it onto telly. Two years from the release and the movie is on... Boy, was I glad I waited(?) What the hell were the writers and director thinking of(?) There are so many holes in the story it leaks crap in the majority of scenes. The acting ranges from abysmal to average. And, the special effects appear to be below par for the time - the opening corvid shot is really horrendous.Poor Michael Crichton is turning in his grave.What the first three films showed was that Murphy's Law was more than prevalent on an island where dinosaurs roamed. So what do we find when the film starts(?) The park is open and has been running for a few years. You just know they've been lucky so far and that their luck is soon to run out. Then we learn the scientists are creating new ""Dinosaurs"" to keep the punters happy and spending their money. I can hear Malcolm screaming now, ""Will these idiots ever learn?"" - Evidently not Malcolm. Even worse is that on the other side of the island they're trying to train raptors. Though we're never really told why they're being trained, there is a military element which wants them as weapons (yawn, what else(?)...). I think it's because somebody had a great idea for a CGI scene later in the film... and this is the only way they could link it in.This leads me to the CGI Choreography because this is what it is. There are sometimes when it's just way too overcooked to be believable. The nannies, Zara's (Katie McGrath) dance of death is a particular case in subject. For me, this was just ludicrous and stupid.Back to the errors in the story, saying that there were no ""Dangerous"" animals on the island so the customers were never at risk was an outright lie. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the island actually believes this, even though the latest creation, which she signed off on, is very dangerous... as well as the raptors... which she also knew about... then at the climax of the film... well, this is one woman you shouldn't trust - ever.One annoying thing, for me, was when Claire reprimands a colleague for wearing an antique Jurassic Park T-Shirt because it could be upsetting to the customers because people died there. The thing is, he never mingles with the vacationers. Secondly, the voice on the tannoy, at one point, actually welcomes everybody to Jurassic Park - Not Jurassic World!I also hated the kids in this film. A geek and a trainee stalker. At least with the original kids, Tim and Lex you could relate to them, this, on the whole, is because there were well written and well acted. Grey (Ty Simpkins) and Zack (Nick Robinson) are pretty two dimensional and boring, which can also be said for the rest of the cast, especially Claire. Only Chris Pratt, as Owen, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Hoskins, give decent performances, though their characters are very cliched.This is one boring, seen it all before, cliche-ridden film that I'd not recommend to anyone - even if the end scene is quite entertaining. I'll not watch this again and I cannot believe there's a sequel in the pipeline.",Jurassic World
158,proud_luddite,Hollywood at its best,8,11 November 2018,"In the fourth installment in the science-fiction Jurassic Park series: a tourist dinosaur park runs into trouble when a genetically modified creature breaks out of her confined area.This is one of those big-budget Hollywood blockbusters that's really worth seeing. The set design of the park is breathtaking as are the special effects. Director Colin Trevorrow has done a great job with mega-crowd scenes and multiple thrills.The buildup to the action/adventure is also surprisingly fascinating. The story takes a shot against the radical bigger-is-better greed and its corresponding interference with nature: something that is rampant in our modern corporate world. (This is ironic as the movie is coming from one of the biggest forms of this mindset: big-budget Hollywood movie-making.)Once the action takes place, this theme disappointingly dissipates. While character development almost always takes the back seat in such movies, there could have at least been a confrontation against one of the characters (or even the showing of remorse) on the trouble she helped create. In addition, some of the performances are also disappointing.However, ""Jurassic World"" is big-budget Hollywood at its best.

159,gizmomogwai,You gotta Respect the Raptors,7,12 June 2015,"As a fourth film in a franchise (not a good sign) coming 14 years years after the last film (not a good sign), Jurassic World gives us a fully-functioning Jurassic Park open to the public, in which Henry Wu (the only character from the original to return this time) designs a completely new dinosaur in an attempt to respark interest (as if interest would ever be lost in a real-life park like this). Of course, ""Indominus Rex"" and some pterosaurs break loose, and it may take the classic dinosaurs of the original to stop them.First, some good points off the bat- I liked seeing Jurassic World open for business. In the first, Jurassic Park is a ghost town, with the staff inexplicably deserting in the middle of their first tour. In the sequels, small parties journey to Site B. Here, we see some imagination in what the park might look like- people explore it by train and hamster ball, and gather around a tank a la Sea World. Bringing back Mr. DNA is a nice touch. The negative points are mainly confined to the first half- our leads are hollow characters, walking stereotypes presented by actors giving less than stellar performances. Bryce Dallas Howard's, in particular, is flat as cardboard- motivated by profit and business, lacking humanity and passion. Vincent D'Onofrio is the two- dimensional bad guy even more concerned with profit, and also obsessively (and bizarrely) interested in sending million-dollar animals (that would never be put at risk by a sane corporation) to war. The two kids are the typical teenager and the boy excited by dinosaurs, but depressed about his parents' looming divorce. ""Indominus Rex"" is no better as a character- just a killing machine, not a real animal at all. Incidentally, they tell us right off the bat it's mostly a T-rex, but keep the other species it was blended with a secret. It's only towards the end that they reveal it's part raptor- was that seriously supposed to shock? That was my first guess! A YouTube video put forward a much more interesting theory that it was a blend of more than just two species- including human. The film also reveals Indominus Rex only 30 minutes in, whereas Spielberg kept his carnivores concealed until half-way through. And when Indominus Rex breaks loose, they don't evacuate the island right away. Riiiiight.So are there any good characters? Actually, the most flesh-and- blood, real, relatable characters aren't human at all- they're the velociraptors. The trailers made them appear completely controlled, with Chris Pratt even in the pen with them, and then showing them hunting Indominus Rex. Reminds me of what Hammond says in the novel- ""Domesticated dinosaurs? Nobody wants domesticated dinosaurs!"" But it turns out the trailers were a little misleading- Pratt's character is only in the pen for emergency reasons, and narrowly escapes death himself. And the raptors at first recognize Indominus Rex as one of their own. And when Vincent D'Onofrio tells them, in English, that he's on their side, of course they don't understand- they kill him. They only spare Pratt moments later because they imprinted on him. They're a little tamer, but they're still animals and carnivores. So, more so than the trailer suggests, this film respects the raptors- and I respect that. Indeed, the second half battle between the classic dinosaurs and Indominus Rex is a bit thrilling, so despite a weak first half, I did walk a way at the end feeling some satisfaction.",Jurassic World
160,maurice_yacowar,family/social order restored as dinosaur attack repelled,8,30 June 2015,"Though the main appeal of Jurassic World is obviously its very special effects, its sense of irony and its awareness of its tradition make it especially intelligent — and witty.Before the two lads go off for their adventure the younger is dallying — he's looking at an old View Master reel of dinosaurs. Of course he's grabbing a preview of his imminent trip. More broadly, the film that flaunts state-of-the-art 3-D and more convincing dinosaurs than clog the senate acknowledges its primitive roots. The film reflects on its origins just as the wiser characters acknowledge their connection to even primeval animal life. The plot adds a touching human concern to the battlefield. As in so many disaster films, the cataclysm restores a fractured family. Here the boys' parents tacitly decide not to divorce after all, and their strictly-business Aunt Claire is shaken into an emotional openness and the resolve to settle with the handsome dino-maven, Owen, ""for survival.""In small ways the film reflects back on the conventions of American film. When the boys manage to animate a dead jeep the improbable scene draws on the simple mechanics that all the Andy Hardys could muster, to build or revive their old jalopy. Owen's communications with the raptors and the heroic intervention of the overthrown king, T-Rex, draw on the tradition of man-horse bond and understanding in the old westerns. Even the villain is as familiar from old movies as from the current Republicans — amoral and ruthless in his desire to weaponize anything whether natural or synthesized.Finally the film works up to a feminist revision of the genre. In all the hoary B-films the heroine would always break a heel, hindering the hero's flight from the monster du jour. Women were ornament and the man's burden, even when they were the scientist's daughter — or the rare as hen's tooth scientist. Aware of that brutal fact of life, Owen reluctantly lets Aunt Claire come along — but only if she ""loses those ridiculous shoes."" Only at the end, after we have watched her run full throttle, show great ingenuity, courage and stamina, and even kill the beast about to gobble Owen, do we see she's still wearing those heels. Against the genre's grain, here a woman can be heroic with compromising her womanhood or complying with the man's demands. This futuristic exercise of an old genre catches the healthier spirit of our time.",Jurassic World

163,sharky_55,Spared no expense - for real this time,5,28 July 2015,"In the original Jurassic Park, the CEO John Hammond was a complex character. He is amiable, ambitious and proud of his ground breaking genetic achievements, yet displays lack of care and hubris over the more technical issues of his park, despite the repetition of the phrase ""spared no expense"". When confronted with his carelessness, he is visibly struck and his motivations change once he realises he never had control of the dinosaurs. It's all portrayed well by the late Richard Attenborough.Jurassic World has none of this. Irrfan Khan plays Simon Masrani, with little nuance as the carefree, charismatic owner of JW who later heroically decides to terminate his million dollar genetic asset and is immediately killed off. JP had the very natural and well acted couple of Alan and Ellie, individually fleshed out yet given a strong base for their careers and mutual admiration in that first moment when we see living breathing dinosaurs. In JW, Claire shoots a dinosaur attacking Owen and they immediately embrace and kiss in a thematically jarring Man of Steel-like moment. To be fair, that's not the worst of it; that belongs to the scene from the trailers where they first talk outside Owen's bungalow (adorned unashamedly with a Mercedes logo). Dallas Howard and Pratt are capable actors but with such a lazy screenplay and with the inevitable romantic sub-plot that immediately predictable when he mentions their first date, there's not much characterisation that draws you into the world of JW. But the biggest offenders have to be brothers Zach and Gray, the nephews of Claire who come to visit the park over the holidays. Gray is younger of the two and a dinosaur nerd, memorising every little fact and detail and being visibly enchanted and excited at the opportunity. So it's a little jarring when a scene change suddenly has his sobbing over his parent's imminent divorce without any preceding indication of this (the script's production woes is mostly responsible for this). Zach is the older sibling, driven by his teenage hormones into the defining characteristic of staring at every girl he sees. But even he is eventually wowed by Jurassic World. In fact it's his sudden change from the sullen mopey teen that highlights just how conflicted JW is with its key themes. The opening exposition Claire gives to potential investors and the audience talks of the dwindling interest of the public in ordinary dinosaurs, yet beyond this there is nothing that drives the motivation to create new genetic hybrids to boost crowds. Every attraction is crowded full of tourists, from adults and kids, all enjoying themselves. Giacchino's rendition of Williams' iconic theme even pops up now and again to signal to the audience when to marvel like Gray. When the Megalodon bursts from the pool and devours a fully grown shark, even the moody Zach is entertained. The world building draws you in with spectacular shots of the park's scenery and architecture, yet the shallow and inconsistent script contradicts this. Trevorrow's direction lavishes in pivot reveals of harsh gouges in walls, enormous footprints and numerous slain bodies of Brontosaurus', and the eye popping digital dinos certainly enhance the whole experience. It would be nostalgia goggles to suggest they look fake as opposed to the original JP but it all still unfortunately pales in comparison when seeking to create an atmosphere of dread, or horror, or even wonder. Clairre's British assistant is brutally killed off in a rather extended and gratuitous sequence for a character we do not care for, and the very one dimensional military enthusiast in Vic is offed rather anticlimactically. The final fight scene is a terribly generic and clichéd action sequence of events that seems to be just lifted from any blockbuster. The shot of Claire with the flare is admittedly chilling, but after that the scene descends into a classic hack and slash, and the little tension that it tries to sustain is quickly dispelled by the laughable coincidental manner in which firstly, Blue ambushes the I-Rex just as it seems all hope is lost, and then finally, the Megalodon bursts from its pool to tie up all loose ends. Even given leeway for its premise there are a few inconsistencies within the script which would be paved over in a better movie (It's a Unix system!). But JW is all glamour and possesses little depth once you start to look a little closer, and it makes it all the easier to spot these mistakes. Why would the entire park have a single helicopter mounted machine gun (or only one helicopter pilot), leaving the hilariously under-equipped containment team to take on a 30 foot monster with electric sticks? Why would you give any tourist the complete control of a gyro ball without any remote control override, opening possibilities for wayward children to ram the dinos and start a stampede, or go offsite and wander into the forest? Why would you lampoon the trope of two characters finding romance in a tense situation (one of the few humorous lines of the movie - Jimmy Fallon does not count) but apply it shamelessly to the title characters? Why would you enter a hostile containment site without first checking the transmitter that always traces its location? I mean, I can buy the I-Rex using the spliced genes of a frog to avoid thermal detection. I can even buy it being able to speak fluent raptor despite being raised in solitary confinement. But you have to recognise when suspension of disbelief just runs out. Even after all that, JW is still worth a watch, if only for the stunning visuals and modern digital creations of the dinos that, more than 20 years on, remain the few upgrades from the original classic.",Jurassic World

165,tenshi_ippikiookami,Empty fun,6,18 March 2017,"Jurassic World has the originality of the indominus rex: it is a rehash of the first movie, with a couple of things from the sequels and a crazy idea thrown in: let's train the velociraptors. It all ends up being entertaining enough, but it is empty as they come and it loses steam along the way, ending with a lazy lazy last part.Isla Nublar is opened to tourists, but after so many years the clients and investors are asking for more and more: bigger, badder, more threatening. It seems seeing velociraptors or playing with triceratops ain't fun anymore. A couple of kids (the typical couple of kids that seem to have to be our center of attention in these movies) go visit the park, where their aunt Claire (yes, we have all talked about it, those shoes) is working. Also working, as a raptor trainer, is manly man Owen, always sweating, always being very hairy and manly, always half-step away of saying his sentences growling.We all know what is going to happen, right? The new dinosaur, a dinosaur that has some tyrannosaurus rex in his DNA (and the rest, secret secret) is going to go on a trip around the island wreaking havoc and making bad, very bad things happen. The way it gets loose is lazy as they come and kind of laughable, but OK, we will accept it. The rest of the plot, I don't need to tell you. You already know it.However, the movie is fun. The acting, even if hilarious in all the machismo the male characters seem to be suffering of, is good enough. The pace is high enough, and even if the plot and its twists make less sense than Claire's shoes, keep things chugging along. And the CGI makes us (more or less) believe in what is going on.If it had had a tighter running time, and if it had left out some risible moments, though, it would have been better.",Jurassic World
166,PartialMovieViewer,Jurassic Slop,3,4 July 2015,"Colin Trevorrow directed and wrote this thing seemingly ensuring the main starCGIwould not be overshadowed by quality acting. Well donebravo. 'J-World' is a fine example of a director taking an outstanding cast and relegating them all to second-fiddle. It is sad enough when talented actors have a sluggish script forced upon them, but these people also had to love-hug stupid, overly friendly cartoon dinosaurs. I am convinced 'Barnie' could have saved this hot mess – I kid – nothing could save this from the oil pits. I will say that Special effects were some of the best I have ever seen...spectacular. I did say the cast was pretty good and it is. Chris Pratt normally plays a fun character and he is probably the main reason I paid to watch this celluloid waist. This time the guy was OKnot for lack of tryinghe just didn't have much to work with. No snarky 'Guardians of the Galaxy' personajust a sense of mediocre interest in the project and a desire to have 'Jurassic World' far behind him. It was almost like he enjoyed filming this production as much as I liked sitting through It. NowI actually enjoyed Bryce Dallas Howard. She is the one actor who actually seemed to have a developed character written for her (by whoI have no clue) but she did manage to carry her part off without a hitch. She has chops, and I would like to see more of her. As excellent as Bryce was, there was no saving the cash-drain of a mind-number. Irrfan Khan is talented but ended up being just OKI think he was the good-bad guyVincent D'Onofrio is very skilled, but ended up as being just alright, I assume he is the really bad-bad military guy (trendy and popular evil-doers). What the heck, the rest of casteaten or not eaten were OK – at best. Nobody was really great. Without a script, no one actually gets a chance to stand out. This movie could have been very good, but pointless direction and messy writing took a lot of excellent potential and made a bad product. How bad? Wellno need to compare this to some other Jurassic version, Ed Wood provided better comparison material back in the 50's and 60's. What were the six writers doing anyways? It definitely wasn't writing. I know plots are stupid things to have in a movie now-a-daysI got itbut some character development would be nice. Example? The Chris Pratt character, Owen, is important because he was in the Navy. OMG the Navy or THE NAVY? I spent twenty years in the Navypainful and irritating at times.but important? Huh? Really? Oh and the kids were at the park because.? Mommy and daddy were divorcingsounds like that's never been used before - not. Spineless parents wont even tell the kids. Oh and the dinosaurs speak to and understand Owen - can I have a big Dino-WOW – and the carnivorous ones are nice and friendly tooanother Dino-WOW. Can't we all just get along with raptors and tyrannosaurus rex...they just want to be our dino-buddies...oh yes...another dino-WOW. In the original renditions, raptors were the super villains, in this installment, they are man's bestest buddies. Snuggly- huggly-ooey-gooey dinosaurs...give me a big.yabba-dabba-doo-doo gag. If you enjoy senseless movies that are poorly written and when they are over you ask yourself, 'Why did I pay for this garbage?' – then Jurassic World is for you. Me, I will never pay to see another Jurassic production, and I may avoid future flicks sanctioned by Spielberg.",Jurassic World
167,phubbs,Jurassic World,6,3 October 2015,"Its been 14 years since 'Jurassic Park III' (which I can't remember a sodding thing about). 2015 seems to be the year in which Hollywood digs up its old franchises, and yet surprisingly it hasn't ended in complete disaster. Again that's pretty unbelievable considering they started production for another 'Jurassic Park' flick back in 2004 and was in development hell pretty much up to the present day.So what are we up against here then mateys, the first classic movie pitted a small team of people against an island full of dinosaurs that were on the loose!..oh this film is exactly the same? errmm...oh. Well OK its not exactly the same, this time the park is open and fully operational with lots of dinosaur attractions for all ages. The difference being, instead of a T-Rex getting loose and becoming the main antagonist, its a fictional genetically modified dinosaur with extra spikes and teeth that can transform int...oops, getting carried away there. But seriously it is that stupid, they create a dinosaur that has virtually every damn assault skill you can think of, the bloody thing can virtually cloak itself, pfft!Yeah so we follow two sets of people around, firstly the inevitable kiddie characters with curiously retro looking haircuts (well one of them at least). Have you ever noticed these modern movies try to copy the hairdos from similar themed movies of the late 70's and 80's? The other pairing are the two adults consisting of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, let the clichéd stereotypical onslaught commence!Right so lets talk about this park, there are all sorts of dino attractions such as a SeaWorld type show featuring a sh*t-your-pants sized aquatic killing machine sea monster, canoe rides down a pleasant jungle river with harmless herbivores, and a little paddy area for the very young to play with baby dinosaurs. Right so its clearly a spin on various famous theme parks/wildlife preserves such as Disney and say...Gatorland (and obviously SeaWorld), in movie terms its 'Jaws 3', moving on.All the characters in this movie are horrible predictable stereotypical clichés, and exactly the same as the first movie. Pratt's character is basically Indiana Jones, Howard's character is the typical soulless corporate bitch who you think might get eaten for being a soulless corporate bitch, but does in fact turn into a watered down Ellen Ripley. The kids are just the same as any other kid characters, the military types are just the same as any other military types wanting to use something for errr....military purposes, the science guys are all whitecoats and kinda dubious and the park controllers in the control room are the comedic relief.Now apart from the plot being exactly the same as before, not only that, but they completely rip-off other movies too. There are not one, but two main sequences that, in my view, copy such movies as 'Aliens' and 'Predator 2'. Firstly the containment team getting wiped out by the I-Rex (I.Rex, iphone...lame play modern technology), and then the whole thing with the Raptors wearing headcam gear, cute but again comes off like said movies. I also find it hard to believe that the original site (buildings) from the original movie would still be fully loaded with equipment and vehicles, plus left unlocked! And how exactly did that gyrosphere thing work? its suppose to be a ride right, yet the people inside have full control and can go anywhere they want?! I thought it was on a track or something at first, surely allowing unlimited control screams disaster.Now don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie to a degree, there are some nice moments of excitement and its not entirely blood free either (which was nice). The location work is lush and stunning, makes me wanna go to Hawaii, the acting is solid and engaging and I liked the gigantic sea monster thing. The problem is there is nothing new here, at all! Its just a rerun of the first movie with the same characters. I mean come on, who didn't guess that the giant sea monster was obvious foreshadowing for the finale, or that the T- Rex would inevitably come into it because everybody has a hard-on for T-Rex's apparently. If the I.Rex is such an intelligent creature why would it go around killing everything for fun? I mean yeah...for fun, sure, its a sadist, I get it. But surely most creatures, especially intelligent, wouldn't act like that unless it was pushed or forced to. To top that the CGI on show is pretty average really, the I.Rex just looks like a pale T- Rex with horns and somehow CGI on the whole isn't as good as the original movie, although dinosaur eyes look good that's for sure.I get the analogy here, how modern society just wants bigger, better, badder, faster etc...We are all greedy, never content, never happy, taking things for granted and of course, the corporate excess machine. The fact that regular dinosaurs have become boring to people, they want bigger, more dangerous ones, more blood and gore...are we not entertained??!! You know, how could anyone not be in awe over a simple dinosaur? The whole thing speaks volumes about us as a society and the movie industry (naturally), yet here we all are lapping this sh*t up, this movie did amazingly well, how? why? The movie pokes fun at itself for these reasons and simultaneously falls in the same trap yet again.6.5/10",Jurassic World

169,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A reboot sequel that is nothing if entertaining.,7,8 March 2019,"What happens when you genetically splice together a reboot and a sequel? This film. It's interesting to find a franchise that's willing to recognize the past material and build upon it, while also adding slightly new elements to it. The idea of training dinosaurs just like pets was undoubtedly the strongest element of this movie, even if the result was the same as it's ever been. Part of the problem with this reboot, however, is that the characters don't seem to click, even to the point of the relationships feeling forced.While there were plentiful nods to the first film that started off the franchise, the plot seemed almost identical to the 1993 classic, but with plenty of cliches and hokey lines to go around. I think sequels like this recognize the elements that made the original great, but almost spend too much time overanalyzing to try and recreate the magic. These films ultimately fall short, mostly due to the synergy and sheer luck that made all the elements of the first movie work in the first place.All that being said, it was an exciting thrill ride with a bunch of ridiculous dinosaur battles: essentially what you paid for anyway. I mean, the first film in this franchise worked because of the terror that goes with being trapped on an island full of dangerous dinosaurs. This film dispenses these scary moments, but in a way that just seems like a Hollywood action blockbuster (which if we're honest, it is). It was nice to see the franchise try to return to its roots, but I also think we should have let this franchise go extinct with only the original as its hallmark achievement.A reboot sequel that is nothing if entertaining, I give Jurassic World 3.5 stars out of 5.",Jurassic World
170,RforFilm,Jurassic World is probably the best sequel were going to get from Jurassic Park. Nothing could have topped the original,8,11 June 2015,"The nineties was a big era for anything prehistoric related. Encino Man, Super Mario Bros., Dino City, Theodore Rex, We're Back: a Dinosaur Story, and even The Dinosaurs TV series all have marked that anything dino related was the trend, and they all have one movie to thank; Jurassic Park. If you ask over a thousand people to name the best dinosaur movie is, I promise that they will all say Jurassic Park. Michael Crichton penned the original novel that brilliantly conveyed the subtext on what happens when science tries to tinker into nature and gave the cinematic feeling of reading about people trying to survive a real life dinosaur.In 1993, Steven Spielberg released the movie adaptation. Not only was the film a blockbuster; it became a landmark. It become the highest grossing box office movie for a while and recaptured the majesty of dinosaurs. The story was fun, the characters were likable, and computer technology was finally showing off with what it could do. Nobody had seen movie creatures to this extent. From that point on, every blockbuster would see what new fields computer effects can accomplish and use them as much as possible. Over twenty years later, we can finally go back to the park in Jurassic World.Sometime after the events of the first movie, the InGen corporation went back to the ruins on the island of Isa Bublar and built a fully realized theme park that John Hammond would have been proud about, Jurassic World. The movie opens with a pair of brothers, the younger dino-obsessed Gray, and his older smart phone-obsessed Zach, who are going on a free trip to Jurassic World as their aunt Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is the parks operations manager. The boys arrive and seem to have fun with the high tech exhibits and creatures, even though Claire seems to have too much work to spend time with them.Her focus is on the parks first genetically modified creature, the Indominus Rex, which is like a T-rex, only bigger and more intelligent. She calls upon dino-expert Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt) to look into the creature's enclosure to make sure it can't get out. As a Jurassic Park movie does, it gets out. Owen and Claire mix trying to find the dinosaur and trying to get the park evacuated while the boys try to survive in a land 65 million years in the making. I went into the theater figuring that no matter what this movie did, it would never be able to top Jurassic Park. Jurassic World is certainly not as good, but it is also the best sequel we're probably going to get with this franchise. The other sequels tried to steer the dinos into another direction that didn't seem to go anywhere, so it made sense to go back to where it all started. The result is that Jurassic World may have a different look, it's story is a lot like the first movie; it has children in danger, a dino-expert clashing heads with business suits that would rather exploit it and plenty of dinosaur action. The focus is still on the characters, and the film takes plenty of time to establish them. Owen and Claire are a pair that I would love to see get into other situations and the boys manage to use their smarts to out wit the creatures. Speaking of which, CGI technology allows the creatures to look better, though I wish they still would have mixed it in with a few animatronics. It certainly doesn't get in the way too much as the animals are appealing to look at and the fights are good old fashioned blockbuster fun.I'll give this eight velociraptors out of ten. On it's own, Jurassic World makes for a good blockbuster. It's no Jurassic Park, but it would have never had a chance. It took what it had and made it good. And that seems to be enough to satisfy me. It should hopefully satisfy those that have been waiting a while for that one sequel. As long as you know the original can't be topped, then buy your ticket and go back to the park.",Jurassic World

Not much later, Jurassic World 2 was announced, and just recently received THE FALLEN KINGDOM subtitle.Jurassic World was a great continuation of the Jurassic franchise, as well as the start of a new planned trilogy. The only link in this film, besides the title and the park, is Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong). Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt, is very awesome, and a fan theory is that he is the boy from the original Jurassic Park that is teased by Dr. Alan Grant. Nothing confirmed, but a fun idea. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron Howard) stars as Grace, the park supervisor.Some of the best scenes remind us of the original, and why it was such a hit in 1993.

172,ivo-cobra8,"A time waster mediocre overrated boring cheap crap, the worst Jurassic Park movie ever!",3,7 May 2016,"Jurassic World (2015) is a time waster! This movie sucks ass!! Boring lame, overrated mediocre crap and copycat of the first film Jurassic Park (1993), Renny Harlin's Underrated action horror flick Deep Blue Sea (1999) and Schwarzenegger's Predator (1987)! I hate this movie and it is terrible just like Star Wars: The Force Awakens this movie is so boring and forgettable, I have quit watching this movie after one hour. I had never such a bad experience with a movie! I will never watch it again. I hate this movie and it is the worst film from 2015 alongside Star Wars Force Awakens they both suck!!!! I am one of the biggest fans of the first film Jurassic Park (1993), I grew up watching that movie, I saw the trailer on TV as a kid and I grew up watching the first movie. I still do have dinosaurs action figures back at home from Jurassic Park, I think I even had a t-shirt or a sweater as a kid written Jurassic Park on it, I was looking for that sweater today and I can't find it anywhere. I love the second one The Lost World: Jurassic Park with Ian Malcolm, you come to the third one and you know what I will take the third movie over Jurassic World. Just like a pure fun popcorn, Action Film I will take that one. They brought Sam Neill back as Dr. Alan Grant. The third entry was a rescue mission, it was fast paced and it went quick time around. I still love The Lost World: Jurassic Park equal as the first flick Jurassic Park, but the third flick grow on me and I love it and I have changed my mind. I love the third flick I love it to death. I will rather watch that flick than this forgettable film Jurassic World! I went to theater seen this awful trash movie, first time I seen it, I thought it was the best one, but that was because I haven't seen the original trilogy for 14. years, but re watching the trilogy on Blu-ray, I really had a blast watching them and all where better than this film. Recently watching this film on Blu-ray, I was extremely disappointed and bored out of my mind. I couldn't finish it the second time around. I wish I could get my money back for the ticket and the Blu-ray disc I have bought recently. Character development is terrible and absolutely forgettable.Jurassic World copy's the first Jurassic Park.Two kids come on the island to the new park to see her aunt, duh we already saw that in the first one. The older brother is a big douchebag to his younger brother, he only cared was about seeing chicks, what an asshole! Bryce Dallas Howard's character is a bitch! She didn't care about the two kids, until same accident happens, just like was in the first movie.Jurassic World copied Deep Blue Sea (1999).T-Rex was faster and smarter hunter and he tricked people believing he escaped off the fence, but actually he was hunting them, they make, the T-Rex smarter hunter! I already saw that in Deep Blue Sea, when doctors implant the human brains in the sharks. In here they did the same thing with the T-Rex! Jurassic World copied Arnold Schwarzenegger's Predator! ""She's killing for sport."" - Owen Grady - we already hear that in Predator 1 & 2.The kids jumps in the water fall escaping the T-Rex, I already saw that in Predator, Arnold jumped off the waterfall! The movie is absolutely terrible shot, I am not meaning directed, but digitally shot with camera, was absolutely terrible guys. The picture was lousy shot.The CGI was incredible fake, Chris Pratt with a motorcycle on a fake CGI with raptors was terrible.Chris Pratt was awful, his character was incredible dull written! Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was fantastic film with Chris Pratt in it, much better film than Jurassic World and when I made a review for that movie 4 assholes put down my review! If you like this movie it is alright I really don't have problem with that, I am just not going to agree with you, that's all.Another flaw I don't like in the film is: those kids find a Jurassic Park jeep and it is been there since 1993 and 16. year old kid start the jeep in less than 30 seconds, how the hell did he do that? duh. That is impossible for a human been, to do that, come on.Raptors are now dogs and you can train them to be your best friend? Say What? That is stupid! They killed Brachiosaurus in this film, I almost cried seeing an animal dying in this movie. None of the movies in the original trilogy did that, not even in Jurassic Park III they did that!This movie should kneel and suck on Deep Blue Sea's dick, since it stole a lot of things from It.Deep Blue Sea, Deep Rising and The Relic for me, in my opinion, all of them are better movies than this Overrated Trash.And yes, I have enjoyed Jurassic Park III Miles ways better, than I did this fake film, rating for me is 1/10.",Jurassic World

174,Anurag-Shetty,An instant classic that lives up to the original and improves upon it.,10,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World is set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park(1993). Jurassic World is a fully functioning dinosaur theme park & has fully realized John Hammond's dream all those years back, of creating such a spectacle(John Hammond appeared in Jurassic Park, played by the wonderful Richard Attenborough). Jurassic World has been in operation for about ten years. However, the theme park's visitors have been steadily losing interest in the dinosaurs, over the years. The scientists who have created these dinosaurs come up with a plan to reignite visitors' interest in the park. On the order of the chief executives who own Jurassic World, the scientists create a new & terrifying genetically modified dinosaur to up the 'scare & wow' factor of Jurassic World & bring the park to its former glory. Unfortunately, this new 'attraction' escapes. Now, it is up to a dinosaur handler named Owen(Chris Pratt) & Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard), one of the head employees at Jurassic World, with help from the technical team of Jurassic World to find & stop the dinosaur before all hell breaks loose at the park. Jurassic World is a fantastic movie! When I first saw the trailer of the film, I was intrigued. I thought, there's no way it can match up to Steven Spielberg's 1993 cult classic. However, I was pretty sure that it would be better than the slightly disappointing sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park(1997) & Jurassic Park III(2001). With a great cast & Spielberg executive producing, I knew this movie would come darn close to being as good as the original. Then, I watched it. This movie blew my mind & roared past my monstrous expectations! Not only does it capture the magic of the original film but also, modernizes the Jurassic Park movies for a new generation of viewers. The viewers will get excited when they see the huge gates of Jurassic World open & enter this incredible park. The 3D lets us see Isla Nublar(the island where Jurassic World is located) in all its magnificence. All the dinosaur set pieces look amazing in 3D. You actually feel like the dinosaurs are chasing you, roaring at you & creeping towards you. One of my favorite set pieces in the movie is the pterodactyl set piece. This is just one set piece out of many superb set pieces involving dinosaurs. I love the fact that the chaos involving dinosaurs doesn't take place immediately. This way, there's a growing feeling of dread during the early stages of the film. This adds to the overall thrill factor of the movie. The special effects are outstanding. The dinosaurs look even more realistic than they did in the previous Jurassic Park films. I liked Jurassic World better than Jurassic Park(1993). Director Colin Trevorrow ably takes the reins from Steven Spielberg & makes a movie that both fans & newcomers will love. Another reason the movie is so great is because, all the actors give us superb renditions of their characters. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Owen. After delivering three back-to-back hits with The Lego Movie(2014), Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) & Jurassic World, Pratt has clearly established himself as the latest Hollywood superstar. Bryce Dallas Howard is superb as Claire. Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as Hoskins. Ty Simpkins is adorable as Gray. Irrfan Khan is charismatic as Simon Masrani. Nick Robinson is great as Zach. Jake Johnson is hysterical as Lowery. Omar Sy is effective as Barry. BD Wong is impressive as Dr. Henry Wu. Judy Greer is good as Karen. Jurassic World will satisfy fans of the original film & will gain millions of new fans. A must watch!",Jurassic World
175,fernandoschiavi,"Despite following the same formula as the original, it manages to be a sequence with several elements of a reboot, bringing new aspects to the franchise",8,20 June 2020,"Many years after the release of the third part of the initial trilogy, Universal Studios revitalizes the franchise based on the work of Michale Crichton, trying to expand it and explore new aspects related to the original plot. The emulation of situations, character characteristics and narrative with the original 1993 film is notorious, in the script originally written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver and which was later rewritten by Derek Connolly and director Colin Trevorrow himself. The great merit of this fourth film is that, despite following the same formula as the original, it manages to be a sequence with several elements of a reboot, bringing new aspects, charismatic characters and still paying tribute and referencing the classic directed by Spielberg.Colin Trevorrow's production lives up to the franchise and adopts a light tone, almost of a juvenile adventure, to snatch families around the world. The synopsis of the film is interesting. Show the park already open, under the attack of a genetically modified dinosaur. In fact, the premise is very similar to the 1993 production, only in a megalomaniacal way. Although everything has become so grand and somewhat artificial, it is possible to be moved by the first scenes showing the place and the attractions. However, certain exaggerations are notable. The aquatic dinosaur is a strong example. There is a lack of subtlety in the direction of the inexperienced Colin Trevorrow. A product of this magnitude should have been delivered to someone with more luggage. The excess of characters, mostly clichés, hinder the progress and weaken the script.
And it is in one of the many possible parallels to be drawn between one work and another that Jurassic World finds its potential: the scene of the sick dinosaur, being taken care of by the protagonists of the original film, returns, adapted to a scenario in which a threat kills animals for pure sport, something more human than bestial. In this resumption, similar to the iconic moment of the classic, one of the few uses of animatronics here, Jurassic World extracts as much as it can from the viewer on an emotional level, since the rest is very superficial. In the other cases, we opted for creations made entirely on the computer, which work well, but have an expiration date. The intimacy of the relationship between man and creature is savored by the script, especially in the connection of the character Owen (Chris Pratt) with the velociraptors, something much better resolved than the other communication made with this species of dinosaur, in the third adventure of the franchise.We also have the figure of the new owner of the park, Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who somehow inherits the park from John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), a former magnate and owner of Nublar Island. Khan's character is a new investor who decided to reopen and continue the genetic research initiated by Hammond. Right away the motivation of Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) to reopen the complex is not clear, because the result is so impressive that the audience is moved by the Park's variability and news. The writers also do not bother to answer some pertinent questions: how was the dinosaur containment problem solved in Islas Nublar and Sorna? Why reopen the park in the same place?
We still see an old character appear again. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong), who was also one of the scientists of the original park, here being responsible for a turn at the end of the plot, reminding another scientist of yore. The villain Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has a peculiar interest in velociraptors, has an outstanding intelligence when respecting their tamer Owen Grady. But the peace of the thousands of tourists in the Park ends when a hybrid dinosaur manages to escape its confinement and becomes the target of InGen Security administrators, who intend to use the new genetics of the most evolved dinosaurs as lethal weapons in the field. The big problem is that the villain is very poorly developed and stereotyped, not posing any real threat.For fans of the franchise, the script still reserves moments of pure nostalgia, whether through the shirt of the original Jurassic Park, or through the tracks and even a car from the same park. Obviously, one of the ingredients that should be well presented in any film in the franchise is dinosaurs. This time, the T-Rex are lagging behind the new threat of this film. With a certain suspense to fully reveal the look of the Indominus Rex - the invincible dinosaur, the special effects contribute to the fantastic tone of the tape and make good use of the beautiful landscapes of Hawaii (chosen to represent the fictional Isla Nubar in Costa Rica). The psychological dimension that Indominus gains thanks to Owen Grady's constant explanations - in fact, the writers use it to explain the film in different scenes. With that, the best character is the hybrid dinosaur. The mosasaur is incredible and the classic scenes with the apatosaurs and triceratops are honored with mastery by the director Colin Trevorrow. The pteranodon and dimorphodon flyers carry the scenes of tension in the film. The villain, Indominus Rex (hybrid) swallows and devours some humans in times of great hunger and anger, while Chris Pratt and his team of Velociraptors prepare for the final hunt. Adventurer Owen Grady's relationship with one of the tamed velociraptors is satisfactorily developed, so much so that you can empathize with Owen and Blue. The proposal to transform one of the villains of the first film into allies is something intelligent and unprecedented.Not everything works plausibly in this eight-handed script. This usually results in a fragmented, contradictory, sometimes stupid, pamphleteering film that has sudden changes in the atmosphere or that has missing characters. Because that's exactly what happens here. Because of a more demanding audience, unable to settle for just dinosaurs (or, presumably, Jurassic Park), the opening of the park comes together with the interest of scientists in the creation of a genetically created creature modified, because that's probably a good idea. For a change, it is not, creating a work with a very predictable character, a statement that suffers a small break in the final third of the work, full of twists, some intelligent, some extremely forced, but none sufficient, justifiable.
Undoubtedly, there is an excess of narrative nuclei thanks to the infinity of characters - which hinders the progress of the story. The first act is lost among the attractions of the park, the pamphlet didacticism, the construction of a bad romance and the growing threat of Indominus. Several times the dialogues deal with criticisms about animal rights, notion of ownership, feelings of dinosaurs and capitalist brands - something completely bizarre since during the film there are countless merchandisings which shows the hypocrisy of the text.The director of the classic feature, Steven Spielberg, acting here as executive producer, wanted to lead the viewer to the idea that animatronics is inferior to images generated by computer graphics. One of the biggest curiosities I had about Jurassic World was about the special effects. Twenty-two years later, a lot has changed in the business. Nowadays it is much easier to create computerized dinosaurs. Fortunately, they did not abandon animatronics for the proximity scenes, and they still work very well on stage. This time, they used much more CGI, making it possible to show more dinosaurs. You gain in quantity, but you lose in reality. The artificial content of animals was not uncommon. A very plausible justification is that they have a lot more screen time than before. In the first three films, most of the tension was created by the performances, the script and the soundtrack. Even with good production design, the intense use of computer graphics to bring animals to life is inexcusable. All the other Jurassic Park - films made on smaller budgets - used the incredible animatronics designed and made by Stan Winston in different ways. Here, they use the realistic technique only on the head of an apatosaurus in a simple scene that can only thrill thanks to the use of ancient technology.The park itself is also magnificently discovered by the viewer, far from the rusticity of the original work, close to the futuristic technological and, in short, unlike the idea brought with the primitive dinosaurs - an interesting antithesis. However, realize that, while in the original film the classic theme found its peak in the first magnificent appearance of the dinosaurs, here, when we open the windows of a room, comfortable and comfortable, the ""world of dinosaurs"" is introduced to the viewer, observing more constructions that creatures in fact. The park is the real spectacle. Technology faces nature.Finally, it is worth highlighting the fact that ""Jurassic World"" does not update itself even in the criticism that makes human attempts to ""turn God"" and to create new animals in the laboratory irresponsibly, or to ""objectify"" animals and turn them into sources of income. In fact, there is always the feeling of hypocrisy when the film criticizes the endless search for profit and news to ""continue to enchant the public"", since Universal itself has a theme park in Orlando, and it certainly does the same. Still, ""Jurassic World"" is entertaining. From the immersive epic soundtrack of Michael Giacchino (Oscar winner for ""Up"") to the childlike wonder of the boy Gray (although he is not the protagonist), it is possible to notice Spielberg's finger (hand, arm, claws) on new park. With a tone of adventure and unpretentiousness that comes closest to Jurassic Park III, director Colin Trevorrow tries his best to present an above average film and does not disappoint.",Jurassic World

Just forget about those last two piles of stegosaurus poo that were the last two films, and belt up for this updated homage to the original.What we have is much the same as the previous films in terms of a story, there really is little scope for originality it seems. Yet its the CGI action scenes that are the crowd pleaser and yes they are incredible, big, loud and thumping.You'll all know what to expect before you even get to the cinema, the originals have been repeated enough times across the cable and satellite channels.

178,agmoldham,This really isn't a good idea,5,13 July 2015,"The original Jurassic Park movie was one of those movies that saw a major shift in movie technology. The actual movie itself played second fiddle to the jaw dropping advance in technology that we saw as dinosaurs roamed the screen. The subsequent movies were always destined to struggle as the wow factor had gone and we could focus on the movie itself. Even 20 years later the dinosaurs don't really look any more impressive. Maybe they would have done in 3d.Anyway as to the movie itself it will not come as any great surprise that the recently opened park is destined for some issues keeping those pesky dino's under control. In an attempt to keep the public in awe the geneticists have created even more jaw dropping hybrid dinosaurs. You have to question with all the issues that have surrounded the park whether anybody would ever consider visiting.Anyway think there was a bit of a love story going on with the same success at chemistry as the dino geneticists. As with many blockbusters couldn't help hoping the dinosaurs would win, but will have to hope they stage another comeback in a couple of years time - sure they will!",Jurassic World
179,Vivekmaru45,Colin Trevorrow Could Be The Next George Lucas/Steven Spielberg.,7,11 July 2016,"For the sheer spectacular special effects, background music and photography I give 10/10. The cast is also 10/10.But now comes the most important question, would I want to see this film again? The answer is a solid ""no"". Even if someone gave me a free ticket I would just give it back to him. The reason is this: predictable ending. The good-guys always make it without a scratch. Now why on earth would we go to see a film where we already know the outcome? Because we are born suckers. We spend all of our money on such filthy, depraved, generic trash films instead of doing something good with it such as buying a homeless person a meal or visiting and comforting someone who is terminally ill. Do not show any of your kids movies unless they are of an educative purpose or documentary, where they learn something. Take your kids to the park, camping or seaside rather then these films. Limit and monitor their internet use as well. Teach them to do simple household chores in your spare time. And make sure they are doing their homework.Back to the film: Twenty-two years after Jurassic Park was overrun by cloned dinosaurs on the Central American island of Isla Nublar, a new park, Jurassic World, has become a successful resort. The Masrani Global Corporation – owner of the genetics company InGen that creates the dinosaurs – has been operating the park on the same island for the past ten years. Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World to see their aunt Claire, the park's operations manager. Claire, a busy workaholic, assigns her assistant to be their guide, but the boys evade her and explore the resort on their own.Verdict: pure 100% grade CGI effects churned by modern computers. Vincent D'Onofrio is the pick of the bunch followed by both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. The direction was so professionally handled, that I thought maybe Spielberg or Lucas was directing the film. Well it turns out that Colin T. Trevorrow who won the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award for Safety Not Guaranteed(2012) had been given the chance to direct this film. And thoroughly deserved. Also I'd like to mention Irrfan Khan is becoming a Hollywood regular with good films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Life Of Pi.",Jurassic World
180,Danusha_Goska,Pretty Dinos; Mediocre Storytelling,5,15 June 2015,"""Jurassic World"" was a letdown. The dinosaurs look as real as cinematic dinosaurs have ever looked. The storytelling is thuddingly dull. I loved the Steven Spielberg / Michael Crichton 1993 ""Jurassic Park."" During this film I kept looking at my watch. Even the music is used badly here, something you notice in the first five minutes of the film. The plot: Jurassic Park has been updated to Jurassic World. Two cute boys visit without their mother. Their aunt is Bryce Dallas Howard, spokeswoman for the park. Vincent D'onofrio wants to weaponize the velociraptors, to use them in the fight against Al Qaeda. Chris Pratt is a velociraptor trainer. Jurassic World has genetically modified dinosaurs into indominus rex, a larger version of a tyrannosaurus rex. Chris Pratt is hot and masterful and deserves a better movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty but lacks charisma. Vincent D'Onofrio's twitchy, creepy opportunist is the single most interesting and menacing performance in the movie, and that includes the dinos. None of this – the two cute boys, the absent mother, the aunt-nephew relationship, Pratt's animal training skills, the weaponization of velociraptors – matters worth a darn. Each subplot is given approximately five lines of dialogue and four minutes of screen time. BD Wong pops up at the last minute and he acts like a mad scientist for about ninety seconds; that subplot goes nowhere like all the rest. There are many scenes of people in a control room staring at a large video screen. Sometimes on screen action is presented in a color- bleached format, to resemble the image on a computer screen. This control-room-point-of-view device serves only to break up the action into smaller, shorter bites, because in the internet age we all have shorter attention spans and we see reality as on a computer screen, don't ya know. The opening scenes show visitors enjoying the park. Then of course something goes wrong and the I-rex escapes. The I-rex eats a bunch of people. Some escapees find a twenty-year-old Jeep from Jurassic Park days and drive it away from the I-rex. I don't know much about cars but I do know that there is a car in a local parking lot that's been there for three months and two of its tires have gone flat. I would believe that you could make dinosaurs out of amber before I could believe that a twenty-two-year-old Jeep could be driven. People outrun dinosaurs, if they are people the movie wants to survive. If they are extras or bad guys, no such luck. And why is it such a bad idea to use velociraptors to fight Al Qaeda? Bryce Dallas Howard outruns dinosaurs while wearing spike heeled shoes. Really. It's amazing that dinosaurs have one goal in life – to eat as many people as they can – given that dinosaurs and people didn't inhabit the earth at the same time. An aviary containing pterodactyls is broken. The pterodactyls swarm out of their aviary and have one goal – to eat people. All the pterodactyls immediately fly to the park full of humans and start snapping them up as if they were potato chips – you can't eat just one. This is especially ridiculous given that pterodactyls were lightweight dinosaurs who evolved to eat fish. Animals in nature kill to eat, to defend their young and their territory, and to establish dominance. Killing is hard work and animals conserve their energy. They don't burn up any more precious calories than they absolutely need to. Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen years annoying one of earth's largest land carnivores, Kodiak bears, before one couldn't take it any more and finally broke down and ate him. Dinosaurs in Jurassic World race through forest, swamp, and parking lots, top speed, mile after mile, passing up other potential prey, in order to eat one particular human being. No real animal has ever behaved that way. I just didn't care about this movie at all. I missed the original. Wayne Knight, the obnoxious fat guy, and Jeff Goldblum, and his priceless pronunciation of ""chaotician."" I missed Spielberg's magic touch in moments like the impact tremor in the footprint and ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear.""",Jurassic World
181,swilliky,Bad Jurassic Park Sequel,4,1 October 2015,"I love the first one and the second is OK. The third is the worst Now that the fourth is coming to digital release, I thought I would write a review. The only thing worth watching in this poor excuse for a Jurassic Park sequel is Chris Pratt, but even his performance is weak for what we know he can do in Guardians of the Galaxy. I thought he was also pretty funny in Parks and Recreation but he couldn't save this movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is gorgeous but her character is so shallow and goes through such a quick change to lose all credibility by the end. I'm sure enough people have commented on the high heels and running from a T-Rex that I don't need to add to it, but yea, bad. The ending was so illogical with the giant fish monster coming up and snapping the ""bad"" big, smart dinosaur just felt forced. I really wanted to like this movie from all the hype and I could've forgiven the rich guy crashing his helicopter just for the cool flashy popcorn movie excitement but then came the kids. Ty Simpkins wasn't so bad in Iron Man 3 and I thought he was great in Insidious, but they really sacrificed his part when they rushed to produce this. The whole starting up a Jeep after twenty or so years, what? These kids didn't come off as that clever, mostly annoying. It was bad overall but better than the Jurassic Park 3.",Jurassic World
182,brookenichole-98054,Fun!,8,10 May 2020,"Jurassic World is amazing. One thing happens after another thing, and there's never a time to pause once the dinosaur starts killing. The CGI is terrific throughout this whole movie and I give these actors a lot of credit. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Nick Robinson, and Ty Simpkins are all fantastic in their roles. The score for the movie is beautiful and never feels out of place.
I honestly forgot this movie was two hours because of how well it flowed through each scene. It's definitely worth your time.",Jurassic World
183,bob-the-movie-man,Nostalgia - it's not what it used to be,8,18 June 2015,"A close family member invites two young relatives to enjoy the delights of a fully-populated prehistorically themed island, whilst meanwhile others with darker hearts have different plans for the revolutionary genetic technology. Thus 22 years ago did Spielberg thrill and excite us with Jurassic Park, a film that made you believe that dinosaurs had been resurrected and taught you, besides anything else, that toilet cubicles are not good hiding places.Now here comes Jurassic World. The plot may be vaguely familiar, but the environment is stepped up several notches. The relaunched Isla Nublar is open for business with 20,000 excitable visitors flocking this way (and that). Bryce Dallas Howard (""The Help"", ""Spiderman 3"") plays park manager Clare, an ice queen businesswoman who can't even be bothered to accompany her two visiting nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) during their first visit. Clare understands that American visitors are fickle things, and dinosaurs are no longer ""Wow"" enough: genetic engineering and cross-breeding are being used to create new variants: bigger; fiercer; less predictable. Chris Pratt (""Guardians of the Galaxy"") plays Owen, a velociraptor trainer yes, I didn't make that up. When things go awry in a big (a VERY big) way, Owen steps in to try to save the day.In any other year, this would probably be THE movie event of the year. As it is, Mr Abrams' Xmas feature bags that expectation slot, but JW has certainly set the bar high. The film has done phenomenal opening business – creating a new US opening weekend record at $208.8M dollars! Think about that for a minute: given the budget was only $150M, that's a return on investment for the studio within 3 days of release! But is it any good? The answer is a qualified yes. In my personal ranking, this would come second, behind the original Jurassic Park but ahead of the disappointing JP2 and JP3.Sure, its a 'park your brain at the door' sort of film, but director Colin Trevorrow, with only his second feature, delivers shock and awe at a sufficient pace to keep audiences entertained and is likely to delight kids (at least those impervious to a little light gore). The sheer spectacle of the Disneyesque visitor areas and a Shamu-like marine show are very engaging, but the film works best when it wallows in the misty-eyed nostalgia of the original classic. No spoilers, but there are a few moments of sheer nostalgic delight to be had.The leads are all effective enough, with Chris Pratt solidifying his matinée idol status ahead of a rumoured reboot of Indiana Jones. The two young leads also shine, with Nick Robinson in particular being very watchable. Great also to see BD Wong reprising his role from the original JP film.Where the film falters is with a stuttering storyline. A forced and superficial romance between the two leads is unnecessary, distracting and drives to a finale that drips with more cheese than the Brontoburgers sold in McDinos. The military involvement in the story is also strangely superficial – whilst it sets something up for an interesting sequel (""JW2: ISIS and the Revenge of the Raptors"" anyone? (Title © RJ Mann)) the film could have been much tighter had it disposed of this thread and focused on the primary storyline.In terms of the special effects, the CGI is OK but at times just tries too hard: a sequence with darting and diving velociraptors in the jungle alongside Owen's bike looks particularly ropy. Dodgy brachiosaurs aside, I still think the 22 year old combination of models and restricted CGI-usage in JP1 was more convincing and much scarier.Those concerns aside, this is a film I would gladly see again and so is recommended for an entertaining night out at the flicks.(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews).",Jurassic World
184,bryank-04844,"""Life finds a way.""",7,27 July 2015,"It's been 14 years since we've stepped foot inside 'Jurassic Park' and got to witness all the wonder and terror of the magnificent creatures called dinosaurs. I think it's pretty safe to say that the first film has been the best in the franchise so far with parts II and III falling behind in terms of overall enjoyment. However, this new reboot of the franchise comes a close second to the first film, as it seems like a 14 year sequel to part I and forgetting the last two films ever happened, which is not necessarily a bad thing.Stepping up to the plate as director this time is Colin Trevorrow, who must have impressed Steven Spielberg with his first hit film 'Safety Not Guaranteed', which was a slow burn sci-fi movie that was quite brilliant. Bits of Trevorrow's insight and style are infused in 'Jurassic World', but this being a big summer blockbuster, it has a more action packed formulaic presence than what we're used to with Trevorrow's work. That being said, 'Jurassic World' still packs the usual suspenseful moments and thrills that come with giant dinosaurs breaching their contained walls and wreaking havoc. What's different and fun this time around is that the ""park"" is now a fully functioning theme park similar to the likes of Disney World, complete with tons of big hotels, restaurants, attractions, guided tours, and over 20,000 people waiting in line to get a glimpse at their favorite dinosaur.The person in charge of the park is Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a woman who is all business and no play, and who would rather raise profits than keep the guests and dinosaurs safe and healthy. She even doesn't pay attention to her two nephews Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson), when they visit her and the park for their first time. In order to raise profits a fraction of a percent, she and new owner of the park Simon (Irrfan Khan) have secretly cross-bred a variety of dinosaurs to make a scary, gigantic new dinosaur that promises to scare the masses, which should boost profits. This being a 'Jurassic Park' movie, things are not all happy and friendly.The giant monster dinosaur gets loose and due to its molded DNA, has a few special tricks up its sleeve, most of which are bad news for any dinosaur or human. Luckily, there is a guy who works on the island named Owen (Chris 'Star Lord' Pratt) who has figured out that dinosaurs can form relationships with humans, specifically the velociraptors, in which he can communicate and train them as if they were pet dogs, and might be able to stop the big dinosaur from wreaking havoc with their help.Meanwhile, a man named Vic (Vincent D'Onofrio), the head security official in charge of InGen, has a hidden agenda in place for the raptors. 'Jurassic World' is best when the dinosaurs are attacking and that certain level of suspense we've come to expect with the 'Jurassic Park' movies. Where it doesn't work is with the multiple story lines that never seem to move past beyond their initial introductory stage. Even the two kids of the film are problematic in that we don't spend enough time with them to really enjoy their characters.Needless to say, the main star here is Pratt, who makes us believe he is capable of running with the raptors and can still be very charming and funny throughout. Yes, most of the characters here make very dumb decisions, but hey, it's a 'Jurassic Park' movie. We need those stupid moments to have a film at all. 'Jurassic World' is also self aware of the movie it is, referencing the previous events in a funny manner, which is always welcomed. Michael Giacchino did a great job with the score as he built upon John Williams's iconic music for the film, which makes an appearance as well. 'Jurassic World' still doesn't hold a candle to the first film, but comes in at a close second for thrills. Jeff Goldblum said it best, ""Life finds a way.""Recommended!",Jurassic World

I'm unsure if the filmmaker was the inspired choice and having one indie film under his belt, it felt uneventful. Spielberg should've returned.

190,DarthVoorhees,Nostalgia can only do so much but it entertains...,7,25 June 2015,"I've heard 'Jurassic World' compared to a tribute band playing the tunes of the Spielberg hit to get smiles. It's a fair comparison. 'Jurassic World' really does nothing new and if I were to be mean I'd say it coasts on the nostalgia we feel for the Spielberg classic. 'Jurassic World' was never going to be a masterpiece in the same caliber that so many hold the original. I don't think it tries to because such an attempt would be futile. 'Jurassic World' knows what it is, a fifties B movie on steroids. And I have to be honest in the age of endless superheroes this kind of was refreshing. It has the problems of a B movie to be sure, lazy characterization and tropes but it's big and goofy and fun...One thing I sort of appreciate about 'Jurassic World' is that so much of the science and ethics are taken out of the story. Spielberg didn't do them very well and really people came to see this film for the dinosaurs. I think this film is really a more successful attempt at doing what 'Jurassic Park III' tried to do. We have an adventure film like the B movies that so inspired Spielberg. The problem is we get all the strengths of such a formula but also all the weaknesses which are in the two leads.Chris Pratt is Chris Pratt. The character Owen is a bore on paper and really hadn't Chris Pratt played the part than I think this film wouldn't have gotten as much of a positive reception. This Owen is merely a B movie gorilla who looks and acts tough. Claire played by Bryce Dallas Howard is a nightmare of sexism. I admire both performances as they realize that this isn't high art but summer movie. I feel as though I have to say turn off your brain which I get that some people don't like hearing. And yet I think 'Jurassic World' is a film that earns the right to say this. While the human characters can be very trope and sort of socially irresponsible; the dinosaurs are just what the popcorn doctor ordered.The dinosaurs are awe-inspiring and just give a thrill in the way that only a good monster can. One thing the movie does pitch perfectly is construct a villainous monster that has personality. Every one of the dinosaurs have personality really down to the raptors being wrangled. How often can you say that in one of these C.G.I extravaganzas? Deliberate care is taken in the building up of the Indominus Rex. The rules of 'Jaws' are followed. We don't get a good look at the creature until she begins her rampage. 'Jurassic World' is the first film in the series since the original to have moments that are suspenseful. The ending sequence of the film is absolutely spectacular. It's action packed and yet we care about what happens. You invest in these C.G.I cartoons and how often can you say that? I think the success has to be given to the script but also the best moments of acting from Pratt who actually has a better connection with the dinosaurs than he does the human characters. Fans of the original will not want to miss this. It takes it's time to lovingly recreate moments and have fun with the memories of the film. If nostalgia alone is why this appeals to you than I think 'Jurassic World' is a must see. It doesn't have the commentary of the original nor the sheer wow factor but the dinosaurs deliver. This really is a great summer movie that has no delusions about being genius.",Jurassic World
191,MattyGibbs,Visually great but loses its way,7,18 November 2015,"Jurassic World is not on a par with the original and I really don't see what the need was for a reboot, especially one with nothing new to add. It does entertain at times as long as you shut down your brain for a while and I guess that's how these films are meant to be viewed. Just plain old entertainment. It looks visually great with great landscapes and realistic dinosaurs, unfortunately the plot is weak and the script whilst having a few snappy one liners falls a bit flat. Chris Pratt does a good job as the lead but Bryce Dallas Howard's character is a disaster. I spent much of the second half of the film praying she'd be eaten. Sadly that would require a more imaginative plot and we are instead left to suffer one of the poorest performances from a lead in quite a while. The rest of the cast are OK but nothing more than the usual stereotypes. For all it's flaws there are some great scenes especially in the first half and I was intermittently entertained. This will probably appeal more to younger audiences than older ones who have seen all this before. Jurassic World just about scrapes a 7 for me but I won't rush to watch it again for some time.",Jurassic World

There's an almost Gaia-its conception of how dinosaurs might solve their own crises and in a (partial) nod to contemporary views, we get a heroine who can take out dinosaurs with a stun gun and also run very fast away from them in heels. All these dinosaurs are female, which incidentally puts Jurassic World It was directed by Colin Trevorrow, whose last feature outing was the indie comedy Safety Not Guaranteed.

Jurassic World is managed by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a successful uptight career woman who is a little bit controlling and unhappy: she is nervous about looking after her two nephews the two brother are brilliant in this we cool motorized vehicles a trip like a childhood Spielberg film friendship and Dino expert child experience of a life time where they don't get bored it brings back friendship and survival have come for a visit to the World, owned by flamboyant entrepreneur Masrani (Irrfan Khan). She is also a bit nervous about the creepy new GM mega-dinosaur they have secretly created to boost visitor numbers: the terrifying Indominus Rex, created by lab supremo Dr Henry Wu (BD Wong) and watched over by the sinister military consultant Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio).Do these people quite realize how intelligent and aggressive their new dinosaur is, do you suppose, and how very unlikely it is to remain within its paddock? To add to her personal non-dinosaur issues, Claire just happens to have some chemistry with fellow JW employee Owen (Chris Pratt), a rough-and-ready Indiana Jones-sh rap tor wrangler and dinosaur whisperer who has actually trained a performing group of prehistoric carnivores to do his bidding for the tourists: he also rides a motorbike, wears a leather waistcoat and appears to live in a . Needless to say, rescuing the two boys from the upcoming Dino catastrophe is going to bring Owen and Claire together and generally end their emotional ice age. Owen is an old-fashioned guy, a rough outdoorsy sort, a man's man, maybe kind of a  well, what's the figure of speech for an extinct old-fashioned type? Certainly not ""dinosaur"": they were vigorous and capable survivors who might yet turn out to have been on earth longer than humans. Chris Pratt gives a tremendously likable performance as Owen: easy-going, relaxed, somewhere on a continuum between Harrison Ford and Tom cruise there are great action set pieces that make this film what it isDallas Howard is also very good: coiffured and groomed and composed as Claire, this actor brings her kind of intense presence to the part. In fact, it is she who has the faintly rapturous presence, especially when her retroussé nose is seen in profile. Owen, Claire and the horrible Indominus Rex make quite a team. It's a world of fear and fun. . This sophistry allows the resort's scientists to create their new attraction, the lethal Indominus Rex, a heady 50-foot-long (15m) mix of Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, tree frog and cuttlefish. It has what the army wants this franko Dino is clever smart so when cousin Rex meets the hybrid Rex all hell brakes lose this film gets my 10 out of ten",Jurassic World
193,virek213,Fourth Time Out With The Dinosaurs...And So Much More,8,20 June 2015,"Michael Crichton, who passed away in the fall of 2008, may not have realized the kind of goldmine he struck when he published his dinosaur novel ""Jurassic Park"" in 1990; but with director Steven Spielberg's help, that goldmine was open for business with the original 1993 film version, and then with its 1997 sequel THE LOST WORLD. Due to Spielberg being heavily involved in making A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE in 2001, the third ""Jurassic Park"" film was left in the hands of director Joe Johnston, with Spielberg staying on as executive producer. Incredibly enough, another fourteen years would pass until the move-going public got the fourth in the series, JURASSIC WORLD.Twenty-two years after John Hammond's experiment at producing an innovative theme part with genetically-created dinosaurs on an island some 200 miles off of Costa Rica came crashing down with the dinosaurs consuming several people, now that same island, Isla Nublar, is now home to Jurassic World, a highly innovative theme park with bigger and better dinosaurs, and, hopefully, with greater controls. One of the workers, an ex-Navy seaman (Chris Pratt), has become especially attuned to a number of the raptors in the park, and has managed to earn their trust. At the same time, the park's principal supervisor (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been overseeing the creation of a super-dinosaur, made up of the DNA of the previous species of dinosaurs, including velociraptors, and tyrannosaurus rexes, that has guaranteed an up tick in revenue and park attendance. But as with anything involving the technology used in creating creatures that have been extinct from the Earth's surface for sixty-five million years, soon everything turns upside down. This doesn't stop the park's main security chief (Vincent D'Onofrio) from seeing a way to use these dinosaurs as a weapon of war, over the vehement objections of both Pratt and Howard, as well as one of the original scientists (B.D. Wong) from the original Jurassic Park. Upping the ante still further are the fact that Howard's two nephews (Nick Robinson; Ty Simpkins) have come to the island to be with their aunt; instead, they find themselves having to behave like responsible adults in the most horrible way possible when the mayhem created by the ""super-dinosaur"" allows all the other species out of their enclosures. When D'Onofrio's megalomaniacal ambitions result in his death, it is up to Pratt and Howard to destroy the super dinosaur with all the weapons at their disposal.As with JURASSIC PARK III, Spielberg's involvement in directing another film (in this case the World War II spy thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES) led him to taking the role of executive producer, allowing Colin Treverrow, whose only feature film credit before this was the romantic comedy drama SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED in 2012, to direct it. With help from co-writers Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connally, however, Treverrow managed to cobble together elements of the first three films into a coherent, if not necessarily letter-perfect, science fiction/suspense thriller that, in some interesting twists, pays homage not only two its three predecessors, but also to Spielberg's 1975 classic JAWS (as the super-dinosaur eats a Great White shark to the amazement of the 20,000+ people in attendance), and to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS (as the avian dinosaurs attack the park visitors from the air with sometimes bloody results).It is not a mark against either the film or Treverrow to say that the film misses the verve and panache of the first two movies that were directed by Spielberg in masterful fashion, though one sometimes wishes he had concentrated as much on characters as he did on the mayhem. Nevertheless, Pratt (ZERO DARK THIRTY; GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) and Howard (LADY IN THE WATER) do really good turns as a pair, despite the rather clichéd bickering they do at the start; and Robinson and Simpkins make for as appealing a pair of kids as Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards did in Spielberg's original. Giacchino's score is impressive as well, and he wisely interpolates John Williams' themes from Spielberg's first two films while also incorporating some of his own ideas.The final verdict when it comes to JURASSIC WORLD is that, despite its tendency to fall into predictability in terms of the dinosaur attacks and some cardboard characters, it is far better than most summer CGI film fare, with enough Spielberg influence to keep it from being just another blockbuster, resulting in my giving it an '8' rating.",Jurassic World
194,griffolyon12,Speed Review,7,18 July 2015,"Jurassic World is yet another attempt at recapturing the magic of the original Jurassic Park, and while the plot has a great many holes in it, you still have fun with this movie thanks to the likability of its cast. The park has now officially opened to the public and guess what, it all goes wrong when the Jurassic World scientists create a genetic hybrid dinosaur to try and up ticket sales. Simply put, Jurassic World is a nice afternoon at the movies, but it is lacking in the scares, memorable moments, and most importantly, heart, that made the first movie such a worldwide phenomenon (although Chris Pratt is his own phenomenon at this point).",Jurassic World
195,0w0,Very good. Worthy of being called a sequel,8,5 May 2020,"Movie's title should have been: ""Dinosaur breaks out an kills stuff #4""Jurassic Park 1, 2, 3 were all very good (especially for their time), so when this movie (Jurassic Park 4) was announced after so many years, I was dubious, but Colin Trevorrow (director) did a great job.The movie has tonnes of action, same as the previous films had, and it followed almost exactly the same formula as the previous films: Stupid humans cause a dinosaur to break out and go on a kill-rampage.Chris Pratt delivers a good (albeit smug+cocky) performance, and Bryce Dallas Howard plays the workaholic love-interest well too... but for once I would just like to see the 'I'm so damn incompetent that I need a man's strong muscles to help in EVERY situation' trope NOT being used in movies that have a male+female lead.Anyway, unlike ""Jurassic World 2"" (2018), this movie is very well directed and I have very little criticism of the movie, although there are several scenes where the humans are absolute idiots, and they handle situations in very unrealistic ways which often end up getting themselves killed.Still, good movie and totally worth watching. Just avoid watching ""Jurassic World 2"" (2018) as it is significantly worse than any of the previous 4 Jurassic Park movies... Fortunately I hear that Colin Trevorrow is making a return to direct the next Jurassic Park 6 film so that is some good news... they fortunately realised their massive error in letting that other guy direct Jurassic Park 5.",Jurassic World
196,Min111,I thought it was okay,6,8 January 2020,"I don't understand what was meant by ""Jurassic World"". It's a good title for a Dinosaur movie, however. I thought the movie was fine. I was actually surprised to be honest, and was expecting something far worse. It had plenty of action throughout, so it won't totally bore you. In fact, the action starts quickly fairly soon, so that goes in the movie favour. It still felt like a ""Jurassic Park"" movie, and it would've been okay to call it as ""Jurassic Park IV"" or something. It felt like a sequel of some sort, but ""Jurassic World"" is fine anyway.",Jurassic World
197,mfellipecampos,Good,7,13 May 2021,"When ""Jurassic World"" was announced, like many fans of the franchise, I wrinkled my nose. ""You can't get anything good out of Jurassic Park"", I thought, ""Only the first one is worth it"", I thought again. The original 1993 film is such an independent, so perfect adventure, adventure, suspense and humor walking together, guided in a magnificent way by Steven Spielberg. A dignified sequence, it would be a challenge that Spielberg himself failed to match in ""Jurassic Park-The Lost World."" When the first trailer came out, everything changed. ""The park is going to open !!"" , I thought, and soon remembered that it never opened to the public. My expectation went up and then the fear of the expectation monster came to disrupt the experience. But, in a period where remakes, reboots and spin-offs reign in Hollywood, just like Mad Max: Fury Road, I can say that Jurassic World is a pleasant surprise. Situated on the same Nublar Island as the first film, these days, 'Jurassic World' is now a real dinosaur park in operation, as predicted by John Hammond in the first film. To continue to attract public attention, the team of geneticists led by Dr. Henry Wu (B. D. Wong) decides to create the first hybrid dinosaur that mixes the DNA of other dinosaurs: the female, Indominus Rex. The Indominus Rex story on the loose is certainly acceptable, although it does not have the same impact as the initial film. This new film works hard to connect with its parent, talking a lot about the visionary scientist Dr. John Hammond, bringing back the Velociraptors with more prominence, and also including a shirt with the old logo of the park (purchased at E- bay). A phrase said by Dr Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) at the beginning of the film, explaining that dinosaurs are not new (as before), that people go to the park as if they were going to the zoo and that they need something new, refers clearly to the studio's challenge of producing a new 'Jurassic Park'. But the film succeeds. Jurassic World is a modern blockbuster, with a much larger scale of events that brings the franchise into the 21st century with great emotions and a lot of fun. But in addition to exciting scenes and a lot of tension, the film is nostalgic when referring to the first. And we really see the island's sights in much more detail, something that is absolutely brilliant. A real walk through the ""Park"". Despite being a family film, the film does well in times of fright, with some really shocking scenes (even without much blood). Bryce Dallas Howard looks great as Dr. Claire, the park's operations manager. Chris Pratt is also doing well, with some comedic moments (mainly with Dr Claire) and action scenes. But he is not the big hero of the film, he is the guy who is there to help. One of the film's weak points are some bad characters, in fact shallow, unnecessary moments (like a couple's crisis, which adds nothing to the plot of the film), and some basic clichés, but nothing that gets in the way of the experience. But the big highlight is the outcome of the film. A simply spectacular ending (breathtaking) where the cinema went into delirium (with the right to applause). Overall ""Jurassic World"" is a fun movie, with a lot of action and suspense. It will please the new generation and fans of the Jurassic Park franchise will not be disappointed.",Jurassic World
198,MrDHWong,A worthy sequel,8,15 October 2015,"Jurassic World is the long awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. While nothing will ever be able to replicate the wonder and joy the original film brought, I can say that this one comes very close. It is a worthy sequel that makes you forget the mistakes that The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III had made.Twenty-two years after the events of the first movie, Isla Nublar has been revamped and redesigned into a properly functioning dinosaur-themed park named Jurassic World, as was originally envisioned by John Hammond. However, after 10 years in service, the park's popularity and tourism rates are declining. In an attempt to attract more tourists, the park's genetic engineers come up with a plan to introduce a new dinosaur, a hybrid Tyrannosaurus Rex known as the Indominus Rex. This idea backfires horribly when Indominus escapes its enclosure and goes on a rampage.This film gets right what its two predecessors got wrong. It manages to expand the fictional universe that Jurassic Park had started without seeming too contrived or forced. The characters were likable as well, especially Chris Pratt's character Owen Grady, a bad-ass, yet kindhearted raptor trainer. The third act alone redeems the franchise of The Lost Word: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. My only real complaint is that the CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) dinosaurs didn't always look very convincing. I guess CGI in the 80s and 90s looked better than the CGI of today.I rate it 8/10.",Jurassic World
199,meydiana-65242,"Graceful, popcorn filled thrilling and tense, taught and energetic. This trilogy gets much better as it goes on.",10,3 November 2020,"Successfully expands from park to world. Truly, it's a Jurassic world after all. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct it, he's still the executive producer. The visuals were thrilling and spectacular and so was the plot line. As the time passes on, the visuals get more artistic and realistic. This trilogy series never wears out it's welcome, I wonder what they will think of next Jurassic Space? I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens. The CGI gets better as the years go on and it successfully replicates and in some ways improves the behaviours of the dinosaurs when they react with humans with the dinosaurs violent behaviours sure to thrill the entire audience!",Jurassic World
200,Laakbaar,Formula works once again,8,6 August 2015,"I've enjoyed all the Jurassic Park movies. The makers of this movie have applied the formula competently; the actors all do their jobs; and the CGI is suitably real looking -- so the movie works reasonably well. It was particularly interesting to jump ahead a generation to see how the ""park"" developed into a ""world"". Forgive me...but isn't this idea of ""Jurassic World"" really sad? The disneyfication of a natural wonder: yuck to that. I suppose this reflects what's really happening though. Art copies life copies art. We flock to the movie just like the crowds flock to the dinosaur island. I suppose the hope is that the money-generating theme parks in Florida will get another generation of eager visitors.The wonder of this franchise is definitely gone for me. Whatever happened to the genuine wonder we all felt about dinosaurs? Is it right for these people to capitalise on that? And then exploit it in film after bloated film?There just wasn't anything that new and exciting about this movie. OK, except for Chris Pratt. Stroke of genius casting him and developing the character to suit his personality. He singlehandedly raises this movie from a 7 to an 8. He is the new Harrison Ford, except even easier on the eyes.",Jurassic World
201,cliftonofun,"Another remake, but that's not all bad",6,27 December 2017,"Perhaps someday we will genetically recreate dinosaurs, but - in the meantime - we can simply recreate Spielberg films. The cute kids from a broken home. The speeches about nature finding a way. Clearly, you have seen this movie before. But it is still totally entertaining 20 years later, and Chris Pratt is totally becoming an unlikely movie star. I would not say the movie is ""good,"" but it ain't bad.",Jurassic World
202,dfa120374,Extremely Enjoyable Addition To The Jurrasic Park Series,7,1 January 2016,"When I first heard another Jurassic film was being done, I did wonder what direction it would be taken, and how they could improve the series. I mean let's face it...more people lost on an island again wouldn't have been very original. I didn't dislike them, but thankfully massive improvements was made from The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.I loved Jurassic Park. I thought the second film was decent enough, and the third was enjoyable even if it was very thin story-wise. Jurassic World, though, wipes the floor with the previous two films, and for me was almost just as enjoyable as the first. I enjoyed a lot of the homages to the previous films as well and they were nice touches.The film took a wee while to get going for me, and there were moments where I thought it was going to be a bit cheesy and full of cliché's, but thankfully this wasn't the case. Yes, there are cliché's scattered throughout the movie, but what film doesn't? It started off a bit ""ho-hum"" but it most definitely got better as it went on. Was the majority of it predictable? Pretty much, but it didn't make it any less entertaining.I think the biggest cliché's were some of the characters, mainly that of Owen (Chris Pratt). Him being a rough, buff macho man who's an ex-Navy SEAL is as cliché as you can get, along with the 'love/hate' relationship between him & Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). I'm surprised they never had him shirtless at some point. Thankfully it didn't become a romantic cheese-fest...apart from them stopping right in the middle of things to lip-smack that is.The CGI, as we have come to expect, is amazing and if I'm honest the first film's effects were just as good. It's just that this time there was much more and all on a larger scale. People will probably moan about it being a ""CGI-fest"", but at least this wasn't like Pacific Rim...all CGI and nothing else.Ignore the hate as this is definitely a must-see movie, especially if you loved the first film.",Jurassic World
203,nicholls_les,Good special effects v Poor acting,5,27 July 2016,"This was an OK movie with some amazing special effects. The Dinosaurs seemed very real and believable. There are more than a few jump out of your seat moments and some of the kills made me question the 12 certificate.Sadly the same cannot be said of most of the actors. I am not sure if it was just a poor script but it seemed like amateur night had been made into a movie. Apart from the Dinosaurs it all fell flat whenever a real person appeared.Bryce Dallas Howard was just awful, she seemed uncomfortable and not convincing in anything she did. Irrfan Khan seemed like a caricature of every Indian actor ever.Chris Pratt was OK and Vincent D'Onofrio probably the best of a bad bunch.BD Wong seems the same character in everything he is in and has an annoying habit of smiling at just about everything.Both the main child actors were nauseatingly bad and I cannot really be even referred to as actors.There were lots of plot holes and the ending was pretty predictable, it was almost a complete copy of the original JP movie but not done as well.",Jurassic World
204,Delrvich,A lot of this was so formulaic,7,14 June 2015,"Making for a very predictable but somewhat, just barely, engrossing movie which relied heavily on the dinosaurs. It was so formulaic this could have been a parody with simply referring to characters, not by name, but titles like: 01. Devious person (D'Onofrio) 02. Common sense person (Pratt) 03. Slow to come around person (Howard) 04. The kids (Robinson and Simpkins) 05. Egoist person (Khan) 06. Trusty sidekick (Sy)but then that would spoil the movie, wouldn't it? Maybe not.And you'd think after three disastrous events, they'd permanently shut down the park.",Jurassic World
205,SquigglyCrunch,Lot's of Fun,7,9 December 2015,"I didn't expect this movie to be amazing, and as expected it fulfilled all my expectations. Jurassic World's plot was pretty basic. It was clear that it wasn't going for a deep, engaging plot. And it certainly didn't have a deep, engaging plot. It was still lot's of fun to see how everything played out though. The characters were actually a lot better done than I expected. All four main characters received relatively equal amounts of screen time, so no one ever felt more important than another. This made it difficult to figure out who the main character was. This was actually really impressive to me, considering it's typically blatantly obvious who the most important character is. The movie was very entertaining. Although some things didn't go well with the rest of the movie, they were always drowned out by the fact that dinosaurs were everywhere. But instead of being small-scale like in the first movie, this was large-scale so loads of people were constantly getting eaten and killed by dinosaurs. Overall Jurassic World is just a heck of a lot of fun. The plot isn't amazing, the characters were good and quite impressive, and there was lot's of good, clean, dinosaur fun. If this movie's goal was to simply entertain, then they achieved that multiple times over. Sure, there was one scene in particular that I felt was out of place, but once again, it was drowned out by everyone getting eaten and the dinosaurs. In the end I would recommend Jurassic World, but not for someone looking for something amazing, but for something fun and entertaining.",Jurassic World

It's Grand Cinema in Hong Kong, where the seats vibrate in sync with the surround effect. This experience was new for me and it was certainly immersive. This film certainly had great sound effects so the vibration of seats was a good one to experience.Coming to the film, there is no value add I got, apart from better visual and sound effects than the classic and original Jurassic Park made in 1993. I simply think that this film was over rated by my friends who went gaga over this and recommended this.Irfan Khan surprised me in this with the role he had played. Apart from that there anything much impressive about this film. There is that oomph factor for sure but not not to my satisfaction.Technically, yes this all the ingredients of a superbly designed film with adequate effects. I wish there was some soul too and not just a body that was camouflaged.An average 2/5 for this.",Jurassic World

The special effect of the dinosaurs was very well made and make them believable. The story is pretty classic and the characters are very cliché even the young characters. The plot have some surprise but its clarly predictable and dont have any great revelation. We just watch events happening and the movie dont keep us engage with the story or the characters or the revelation.

208,Rickting,The best of the sequels,7,16 June 2015,"While most rightfully are saying this is the best of the sequels and certainly better than the trailers made it look, some are pretty unsatisfied with Jurassic World. While flawed, JW is ultimately a strong, nostalgic and well made blockbuster that avoids the flaws of the other sequels. The Lost World descends into mediocrity and lacks an interesting plot, while Jurassic Park III is devoid of a compelling story, although it has some cool set pieces later on. This one actually has a good plot, although it's a bit mystifying as to why they went ahead and opened the park. A genetically modified dinosaur goes on the rampage, giving the plot a tight, suspenseful focus and once again having the thought provoking themes of hubris the original had. It's tense, exciting and there's actually a sense of fear as this time many members of the public are involved. The trailers looked generic but thankfully this is a pleasant surprise, and most likely soon to join the Billion Dollar Club. The biggest surprise of all is that the kids are actually semi bearable.With a good story, decent CGI and plenty of tension, this is a good blockbuster, but flaws are aplenty. The action doesn't reach the heights of prior instalments and the finale has a bit too much CGI. The characters aren't done well. Although he gets through the film with one expression mostly, Chris Pratt does a fine job as the hero, but the other characters are side-lined, while Bryce Dallas Howard, despite her best efforts, is stuck with a boring, tedious and irritating character. Somewhat unremarkable and occasionally reeking of sexism, JW lacks true punch and opts for more generic CGI set pieces. More effective are the nostalgic nods to the original film. After the 22 year wait for another good Jurassic Park film, fans of the original will undoubtedly appreciate this. Colin Trevorrow isn't Steven Spielberg, but he directs the film well and more often than not borrows intelligently from Spielberg and uses genuine suspense. There are illogical plot points here and there but you're unlikely to notice them. Good stuff overall.7/10",Jurassic World
209,dilipbts,Jurassic world,8,19 June 2020,"OK, I read the 2 novels before the original movies came out, and was hooked back in 1991/92 when the original movie came out. Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they're worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I'm still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it's Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn't a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main 'side characters' are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I'll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)Don't let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren't exactly 'tamed', barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg's personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.The island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its 'history' (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can't say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there's a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable.Please note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn't take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than ""I think this was Gennaro..."" Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don't listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here.",Jurassic World
210,DareDevilKid,"A Thrill-a-Minute, Kick-Ass Ride! To Sum it Up in Two Words - Pure Awesomeness!",9,17 July 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.7/5 starsWhile ""Jurassic World"" might not match the original for sheer inventiveness and impact, it more than delivers as a supremely entertaining and visually dazzling sci-fi actioner with a surprisingly witty screenplay, top-notch cast, spellbinding special effects, and gripping, coherent action. Combining enough nostalgia, technical wizardry, and over-the-top thrills, ""Jurassic World"" makes fans of the original feel like kids again (yes it's by far the best of the sequels - though I fell the 2nd and 3rd parts get undue hate - and almost on par with the 1993 classic), and is sure to pick up many ardent fans from the newer generation along the way.By illustrating just how far summer blockbusters have come in the past 40 years, the only way the young people of ""Jurassic World"" can be entertained by a great white shark is by seeing one of them fed to the aquatic Mosasaurus, who splashes about in his performance pool and drenches park guests. Built upon the bones — literally — of John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) original park on Isla Nublar, Jurassic World is a well-oiled tourist mecca. But the theme park has become so popular that the once-terrifying experience of encountering a living dinosaur has become as commonplace as staring at an elephant in a zoo. Children can ride a Triceratops and hug their favorite herbivores in the Gentle Giants Petting Zoo. Older guests can kayak down a river and get up close and personal with Stegosauruses on the Cretaceous Cruise. To combat visitor fatigue, geneticist Dr. Wu (BD Wong, reprising his ""Jurassic Park"" role) has spent $26 million of corporate monies cooking up Indominus Rex, the park's first engineered hybrid. She's cobbled together from the DNA of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Carnotaurus, Majungasaurus, Rugops, Velociraptors, and Giganotosaurus, as well as some bits of cuttlefish and tree frogs. As Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), Jurassic World's no-nonsense operations manager, says, ""Consumers want bigger, louder, more teeth.""On the one hand, the film is exactly what you think it is — a lot of people being chased or menaced by ill-tempered dinosaurs that are trying to eat them. On the other hand, there's a level of wit here that you may not expect. The story is no great shakes, of course, since it exists only to put our main characters — and disposable extras — in harm's way. The reason behind this latest addition to the revamped dinosaur amusement park is, however, worth pondering — it's all because a jaded public demands something bigger and badder and scarier than your plain old dinosaurs. As a commentary on our collective Imax and 3D infused Next-Big-Thing blockbuster mentality, that's pretty on point. That the commentary is served up in a movie aimed at that very mindset makes it just that much more subversive. And it most certainly delivers on its promises. The ultimate bad-ass dinosaur — the Indominus Rex — is everything you could hope for in bad-assery, and the film's rather cavalier attitude toward human life ups our inability to predict who won't be standing by the ending credits.Given the park's previous tragedy, Jurassic World's showman of an owner, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan, ""Life of Pi""), has Claire bring in animal-behavior expert Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to inspect the Indominus' paddock. Owen's been working in a research facility on the outskirts of Isla Nublar, clicker training Velociraptors under the watchful eye of a security contractor (Vincent D'Onofrio), who wants to weaponize the raptors and turn them into dino-soldiers. The uptight Claire and the laid-back, boardshorts-and-tequila-loving Owen barely have time to reminisce about their one disastrous date before the Indominus escapes, begins killing the park's security personnel out of instinct and the other dinosaurs for sport, and endangering the park's 20,000-odd visitors — including Claire's nephews, 11-year-old Gray (Ty Simpkins) and 16-year-old Zach (Nick Robinson) whose Gyrosphere ride encounter with the hybrid is a suspenseful centerpiece.Only one other scene tops that one for gash-and-giggle tension, an aerial assault on fleeing tourists by prehistoric creatures. Think of ""The Birds"" directed by Fred Flintstone for a sense of Trevorrow's cheeky style. Trevorrow was handpicked by Steven Spielberg to direct, with only the brilliant sci-fi indie and 2012 Sundance hit ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" to his credit. That he and Derek Connolly (who wrote ""Safety Not Guaranteed"") collaborated again for the screenplay along with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver was encouraging, and it shows in the final product. It's also a pleasant surprise to see just how well Trevorrow handles action. It's clear, clean, and coherent. Trevorrow hits all the right, respectful beats, as a protégé should; you can sense a desire to please his mentor, with several amusing references to Spielberg's 1993 original, and a climactic, triumphant nod to another of his works. Also, the finale is every bit as silly and over-the-top as it's thunderous and deliriously fun.Pratt is perfectly, heroically dashing as Owen. Bryce Dallas Howard is Pratt's match as park operations manager Claire Dearing, the by- the-numbers, uptight corporate type who must be swayed and kissed. But the film wouldn't have been as entertaining as it is without its supporting players — Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Jake Johnson, and BD Wong. These actors imbue their cleverly written but actually thin characters with shadings and nuances that have little to do with the printed page. My only problem with the movie is that there's just not enough of the great Irrfan Khan.While the first hour of ""Jurassic World"" cleverly sets things up for the ensuing mayhem, the second half is out-and-out, chest-rumbling, dino action. There's an ethical discussion throughout the ""Jurassic"" movies about whether dinosaurs ever should have been cloned. But, thanks to ""Jurassic World"", there's no debating the merits of bringing this franchise back from extinction.",Jurassic World

Perhaps it is the first hour that has all the exciting action everybody else is talking about, but I saw the last 2/3 of it and it was a big yawn for me...And what's with the riding around the island on motorcycles...and who thought up using raptors as hound dogs, to find the T-rex they apparently lost, heh heh...Truly, there is little to praise JW for...certainly not a coherent story, nor the mediocre acting...even the CGI was not up to par with the originals...it just turned out to be a nothing movie...Steven Speilberg created a magical world, and this director destroyed the magic...",Jurassic World

""Jurassic World"" doesn't compare to the first one but it's better than the last two and, at its core, it's still a lot of fun.The human characters aren't written the best and come off so flat that it was really hard to get completely invested in them but the popcorn spectacle the film throws at you non-stop is really what makes this film fun to watch. The film doesn't venture very deep into too many of the themes the first one had but what it lacks in this department it makes up in decent gags, set design that felt like a real, working park and some killer dino-on-dino death matches. Plus, it doesn't hurt having the awesome Chris Pratt in it and it really doesn't hurt that he has his own raptor pack.Overall, the film is just mindless fun and it works for what it is. It would have been nice to see some more practical effects mixed with the CGI like the original film did back in 1993 but we live in a world of filmmaking where computers are the default setting. The complaints are minor and they never really stopped me from enjoying the film because, at the heart of it all, Chris Pratt has domesticated raptors and that realistically could have been the entire film and I would have been totally cool with that.",Jurassic World

Lots of jumpy moments but we are spared the more grisly stuff: people are snatched and killed but 'chew and splatter' is mostly kept off-screen. Once the two young brothers are trapped out in the park with the killing- machine monster, the rest of the plot (actually all of the plot) is very predictable - Claire and Owen rescuing the kids from a series of perils. Nevertheless, the sheer pace of the movie largely obliterates any sense of over-familiarity. And the CGI is - no other way to say it - simply ""awesome"": the interaction between actors and creatures is seamless.

Ripping off ALIENS, a troop of soldiers are viewed on their own monitors, falling prey to a gigantic combination of T-Rex and other mischievous ingredients at the famous (or infamous) Theme Park finally open to the public, and not just in test-only mode or posthumous ruinsActually, it's been going for a little while, and people are already tired of normal dinosaurs roaming around: thus the edgy hybrid was born. And if up to leading lady and semi-villainous Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire, whose nephews visit the way John Hammond's grandchildren did in the original, the fierce monstrosity would have its very own limousine... But our token action hero Chris Pratt knows better Much, much better With breezy idealism intact, and an ability to maneuver Raptors like sheep, unlike his GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY intrepid slacker he's just too perfect to relate with. And, being this film's Sam Neill, there's a potential Jeff Goldblum sarcastic sidekick who winds up completely benign. So all Pratt's Owen does is argue with the slowly-thawing Claire as they attempt to rescue the boys, who, like everyone else in human form, we hardly get to know at all Especially one jerk wanting the dinos for military gain: Talk about cliché.The real crime of WORLD is the lack of JURASSIC: the impressive location is a mere afterthought for a dull Monster Movie while the other neat looking dinosaurs are hardly shown at all. Just because the fictional public within this story are tired of them doesn't mean we are.",Jurassic World
215,The_Light_Triton,Taking bets on who's gonna get eaten first.,9,5 September 2015,"It's Jurassic Park. You just know someone is going to get devoured. It's just a matter of who's going first.22 years after the original Jurassic Park was built, the popular tourist attraction Jurassic World operates, as originally envisioned by the visionary John Hammond. Visitors can interact with herbivore dinosaurs and witness the decimation of livestock by the carnivores. But after 10 years of operation, the park's visitor rates are declining. They need something that's going to bring back the people. As a result, they create a new dinosaur. But this dinosaur's more intelligent than the mad scientists who created her. and pretty soon, the park becomes an entrée plate of goodies. The real question is, who stays alive and who gets eaten? For those who love a good monster movie, you're in for a good time. The action comes and goes and the survival horror mentality is there.First of all, it was nice to see Chris Pratt as the hero but since he came off the lapels of Star-lord in Guardians of the Galaxy, it's kind of hard not to see him that way here. To me, he's still Star-Lord, except now, he's dealing with dinosaurs.Bryce Dallas Howard plays the quintessential woman of the film, Aunt Claire. And personally, I wanted her to get eaten the most (Well, except for Private Pyle) She demeans her nephews and treats them as if they're young children, when they somehow get a 1992 Jeep Wrangler running on fuel and a battery that had been sitting for 20 years, and they can drive Stick shift. Aunt Claire wears heels and gets glorified like Wonder Woman. That's the only thing that prevented me from giving this movie a 10.And I mentioned Private Pyle. Vincent D'Onofrio. He played Private Pyle in Full Metal Jacket back in 1987 and here, in an ironic twist, he's now a top military guy, looking for a new way to fight insurgents around the world...and trained killer dinosaurs come to mind.To close the review, I recommend you go and see this film. It's going to have a sequel in a few years, and hopefully that one will be as fun as this one was.9/10",Jurassic World
216,bbickley13-921-58664,Four times better than any other Jurassic Park sequel!,8,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World is a worth wild sequel to a great franchise. The wonder does not top the original movie, but the adventure does. The movie is epic, bigger and better than all the others. A perfect blockbuster in every way. Pay no attention to the weird science that's going on and keep focus on the cartoonish action that drives the movie. It's corny at times, but it perfectly pays homage to Spielberg style blockbuster making The dinosaurs are terrifying and awesome at the same time. The movie only showcases two new prehistoric creatures that have not been seen at the park before, but the oldie but goodie Raptors are in it, proving that you can try but noting can knock them off the top of the cool chain. Milking the success of Guardians of the Galaxy is Chris Pratt as the dashing hero type, using his ruggedly handsome looks to tame the beast...that is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays the not so damsel slash sidekick in the film. It was a fun ride at the movies and worthy of its IMAX release. It was filled with contemporary satire that does not forget the original while pressing forward and just when you think you saw the best part...you haven't. It just keeps getting better in its outrageousness. See this one!",Jurassic World
217,harryplinkett14,"Silly, but relatively entertaining",3,16 September 2015,"The plot is all over the place. The characters are silly, the dinosaurs are silly, the events are predictable and silly. Then again, the characters, while hardly three-dimensional, are at least not total cardboard cutouts and dinosaur meat. Since Hollywood has lowered our expectations dramatically during the past two decades, one has to appreciate even such small positives. However, here is the problem: the film doesn't know what it's about. It focuses entirely on two brothers during Act 1, only to drop them almost completely and explore a romantic relationship between two secondary characters, and then go straight to the great dinosaur chase involving trained dinosaurs (!), which is clearly intended as the greatest attraction of this Jurassic tour. At the end of the day, this is just a mildly entertaining film, and a way to waste another couple of hours of your life. There is nothing original here, and it comes across as more of a ride than an actual film. A ride you've visited many times before and are somewhat bored of. Ironically, the film itself says that the dinosaurs in the park have become dull for the audiences. How true.",Jurassic World
218,osj2507,Back to being a kid at a theme park,8,11 June 2015,"At the beginning I thought this was going to be a reboot of the series and that seemed a bit strange to me since the first film is not to be messed with, but now they say that they have written out the second and third film of history and this is a new sequel to the first one, and that makes so much sense. I must say that the second and third film wasn't that good compared to the first one, so this works out as a fine sequel to the first.Jurassic World have been running successfully in 10 years after the incidents at Jurassic Park, but guest count is declining, so they decide to create a new dinosaur, since they have run out of species to clone, this one is designed and is what they call a genetically modified hybrid, what can go wrong by creating your own bigger, stronger and with more teeth edition of a dinosaur.There are lot of good things to say about this film, but also a few things that doesn't work for it, luckily the good trumps the not so good, so all-in-all it becomes a very decent film with high entertainment value. The best part is actually that they continue the series as a new second film and that opens up for a lot of possibilities, but it is also the way that this is a big theme park and you really run along side Gray (Ty Simpkins) and want to see all the attractions and investigate all you can and see all there is to see. As a theme park this is really a cool place, with interesting rides, and great attractions, I especially like the hamster bubble for people, it is just something you really want to try yourself. Once again we are unfortunately stuck in the dilemma, that if you have this big facility and know that these are powerful and strong animals, why then create a bigger one and not account for the security precautions that are needed is a rookie mistake. So it worked for the first film because it was new and nobody had done it before, but this second time around, and since the park have been running for 10 successful years, they should know more about the game they are in and not make security mistakes, they should have calculations and preventive measure to make sure it can't happen.It is an entertaining film, there are a lot of fun moments and a lot of great fights between dinosaurs and in general a really great experience that takes you back to the age when you saw the first film in many ways. It can be enjoyed by old and new fans of dinosaurs and in my opinion you don't have to have seen the first film to know what it is all about.",Jurassic World

221,MovieHoliks,Terrific Reboot/Sequel To The Series!....,7,23 June 2015,"I remember hearing as far back as '91 I think that Steven Spielberg would be making the movie version of Michael Crichton's novel ""Jurassic Park"", and thought there has never been a more perfect fit between filmmaker and project. That film, released in 1993, broke just about all box office records at the time, introduced ground-breaking cinema special effects, as well as spawned two successful sequels. What started out as a film about the wonder of seeing real dinosaurs in the flesh turned into a beast vs. man horror flick. With ""Jurassic World"", set in real time 22 years after that first film, that ""theme park"" envisioned by John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough) of the first film, becomes a reality- complete with kiddy petting zoo, wet bars for the parents, motels, etc... One little thing they seem to be leaving out is how do you advertise for this thing-??? ""No one was eaten THIS year!!"" LMAO Bryce Dallas Howard (looking especially yummy mm-mm) stars as the theme park's manager, and Chris Pratt as a raptor expert brought in to help capture a genetically-engineered dino-monster gone MIA! I must admit I had a really good time at this- a lot of which just reminiscing about things I recalled from the first films, all of which I enjoyed. And this movie has plenty of references to those movies. You'll notice them scattered throughout the movie. Yes, it was predictable and clichéd, but in an enjoyable way. You go to a movie like this, not for the characters/storyline, but to see big scary monsters eat people in a variety of different methods! LOL Vincent D'Onofrio, Judy Greer and BD Wong (in perhaps the only character from the first film) co-star.",Jurassic World
222,Al_The_Strange,The park is open,8,16 July 2015,"Dinosaurs were resurrected with the miracle of genetic manipulation on Jurassic Park, but all attempts to control them ended in chaos and bloodshed. The pattern persisted through two more movies, and now it persists through another. This time, in the fourth film of the series, the park is finally open. Tourists flock to Isla Nublar to see living, breathing dinosaurs on exhibit. Something's bound to go wrong...True to the formula of the series, the film starts off slow, establishing a few key characters (including kids for the narrative to anchor onto, again) before things start to go wrong. From the halfway point onwards, the film unleashes all kinds of hell when the dinosaurs inevitably break free and start wreaking havoc across the park. There are plenty of spectacular scenes in which dinosaurs stomp their way through entire crowds of hapless humans. It eventually builds up to a huge showdown between the classic dinosaurs we all know and love, and the menacing Indominous Rex.Other things that make the film interesting will be its revamped setting - a fully working amusement park - and a few cool ideas, including the possibility of using Velociraptors in combat. You know what you're getting with the plot; it follows in the same pattern as the first film, complete with the recurring theme of chaos theory and humanity's inability to control nature. It reaches a pretty bizarre climax where the films seems to emphasize the dinosaurs in a heroic light, and it becomes a bit cheesy. What makes the film lovable will be its characters, who aren't terribly deep, but are often colorful and charming most of the time. Some of them make some pretty dumb moves, but for this series, it's to be expected. There are a couple of kids in the mix, to give us the familiar family-esque dynamic. Watching the leads comes together proves to be charming and enjoyable, thanks to their personalities.This film is made with good photography and editing. The cast is a pretty colorful bunch: I enjoyed watching Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and the kid characters. Other players are not bad. Writing is pretty lightweight, but it gets the job done. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects offer plenty of incredible sequences, and are fun to watch. The music score brings back some of the classic themes, and is pretty good.Of the Jurassic Park movies, I value Jurassic World for finally pushing the series into interesting new territory, rather than rehashing territory already explored in the other two sequels. It doesn't quite surpass the first film by any measure, but I find its characters and action more likable than the other sequels, and the film is worthwhile for any series fan.4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Jurassic World

Despite its doomed exhibition, corporate still has not learned and this time has created a fully functioning theme park on the island of Isla Nublar of Costa Rica. Funded by Samsung, Verizon, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, DQ, Mercedes, Hilton and Beats by Dre, the amusement park wows and amazes with interactive petting zoos, Sea World-esque tank shows and voyeuristic tubes that put attendees right in the thick of the dinosaur jungle. What's the next step to shock patrons and remedy declining visitor rates? Why, a genetically modified dinosaur whose predatory skills are only just scratching the surface.Despite the movie world of Jurassic World coexisting in the same universe as the original Jurassic Park, humanity apparently has learned very little since the treacherous misguidance in arrogance of Hammond's park. And it is in these blundering and arrogant human behaviors that audiences will find Jurassic World most infuriating.The story of Jurassic World is more complex in comparison to the original's plot, what with it being the fourth film of the franchise. We have the story of a family on the brink of dissolution, we have a career oriented woman managing one of the most complicated theme parks in existence, we have a trainer who takes charge to save innocent bystanders when hell inevitably breaks loose, simultaneously we have the action plot of a vicious genetically modified dinosaur voraciously wreaking havoc.There are aspects of the narrative that are completely unneeded and without which would have yielded a simpler more engaging story. Components of the film are spot on, specifically Chris Pratt and the role he plays along with the slight humor the kids inject in moments of tense terror. The tone of Jurassic World ebbs and arcs, at times perfect and at other times completely interrupting the flow of the film. The kills and action scenes are not memorable and sloppily difficult to follow. And while the CGI is adequate, it is at times overly wet and fake looking, prohibiting the ability to become fully immersed and engaged and we wish more practical effects were used, despite the budgetary burden they may inflict.Those sponsors mentioned above aren't just for the fictitious amusement park's bank roll but are also undoubtedly key financial supporters of the film itself. Their inclusions are a laughable distraction and the director is so heavy handed with his token features of the brands, one can only assume he is dense or was completely against corporate sponsorship in his film.The aesthetic of the park itself is the most wondrous aspect of the film and most closely resembles the wonder Jurassic Park induced. Creatively, Jurassic World as a theme park is amazing and perfectly thought out. As a film it is uneven but satiates the dino-craving.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Jurassic World

226,SkullScreamerReturns,Best Jurassic Park sequel so far,7,18 May 2021,"The first Jurassic Park is one of my all-time favorite films. The second part had its moments but being nowhere as memorable. And the third was even more forgettable.One thing that distinguished the first one from the sequels was the island. Along with the dinosaurs and the story of adventure, also the park itself was an super interesting setting with its techno-thriller vibe. The sequels happening in some other islands just didn't create the same electrifying atmosphere.Jurassic World returns to the original island and even though the park is built brand new, there are still relics of the original park to be found which nicely ties together these movies. The story, even though quite similar to the original is still very interesting and exciting. The special effects are ok too, especially the end battle of the dinosaurs was quite cool (says me who is not a fan of cgi monsters). All of the characters are not the best possible but they do the job I guess. My biggest complaint is that the story is not explained enough to start with; John Hammond is mentioned but it is not told why is this random greedy woman leading the park and how did they get the licence from Hammond to recreate the park. And who is her sister whose kids are in the park. The reason why these characters are in the story seems random.Overall Jurassic World lacks the heartfelt atmosphere that was in the first movie but it's still worthy tribute and sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi adventure films, and quite an exciting movie in general.",Jurassic World
227,Cinemaniac1984,"Enjoyable fun, but more of the same.",7,19 June 2015,"The early trailers of Jurassic World looked very promising and was generating a lot of hype similar to the first Jurassic Park (1993) which became one of the biggest movies of all time. The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) was one of the biggest movies of 1997 however there were a lot of mixed reviews. Jurassic Park III (2001) was also a box office success however the movie was critically underwhelming. Jurassic World was a welcome entry into the Jurassic Park series and it was enjoyable, although it was more of the same.22 years after the original Jurassic Park went horribly wrong, a fully functional dinosaur theme park called ""Jurassic World"" has become a reality and opened up on Isla Nublar. Originally envisioned by John Hammond, Jurassic World has proved to be a huge success over the past decade although in recent times visitor rates have started to decline. Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) are sent there to visit their aunt, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park's operations manager however Claire is too preoccupied with recruiting more investors to fund bigger dinosaur attractions to maintain the park's attendance as well as being a stickler for statistics. It is evidenced throughout the movie that despite Claire's high maintenance personality and drive for success, she does not know much about her nephews and seems to be distant to them as well as her own sister and the boys' mother (Judy Greer). To revive the theme park's success, the InGen corporation genetically creates a new breed of dinosaur as a new attraction named the Indominus Rex. This experiment is spearheaded by one of the original scientists from Jurassic Park now the chief geneticist Dr Henry Wu (B.D. Wong). Things go terribly wrong when the Indominus Rex manages to escape from captivity and it wrecks havoc on the island, endangering many lives. A former Navy sailor turned Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) must also help Claire and slimy InGen Security Chief Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio)take down the Indominus Rex.Chris Pratt is always a pleasure to watch on the screen and he continues to cement his status as a down-to-earth, heroic and humorous action star, especially after the success of Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). In fact Chris Pratt was the only real likable character in the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard seems unconvincing as the parks operations manager Claire Dearing. For a manager who knows all her statistics and business operations, she came across as someone with limited social skills, common sense and emotions. Vincent D'Onofrio seems like a slimy villain with no purpose only to throw his weight around with his massive power tripping ego as well as to carry out his own selfish motives to take down the Indominus Rex yet his plan fails. Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell were quite good however some of their scenes just seemed like they were thrown in to show they were just token kids of the modern age. The only original cast member to return was B.D. Wong, and at least it was good to see someone from the original movies.Director Colin Trevorrow did a good job resurrecting the franchise with Jurassic World and hopefully he will go onto bigger and better things.Jurassic World was a lot better than Jurassic Park III in my opinion. I felt that Jurassic Park III was underwhelming. The Lost World: Jurassic Park seemed to be over-hyped but still watchable. I haven't seen Jurassic Park in years however I still remember from when I was a young kid all the hype surrounding the movie, deservedly earning its spot as one of the biggest blockbusters of 1993.The action in Jurassic World was a lot more exciting and the movie was still very enjoyable however you felt like it was done three times before, thus running over old ground. Still it was good to see the Jurassic Park franchise being resurrected with Jurassic World and it was well worth seeing it at the cinema.Will we see a fifth Jurassic Park movie? Who knows given that Jurassic World has been a success at the box office.Watch Jurassic World and enjoy it for what it is.7/10.",Jurassic World

Also, the fact dinosaurs interact with human-beings shortens the distance between two species' relationship. Dinosaur stays friends for kids even after the movie.Only fault... Even dinosaurs look so real, Bryce Dallas Howard's running in hills all day at full speed keeps reminding the audience it's still a movie.",Jurassic World
232,stevenrotherforth,"So you've opened a park with Dinosaurs in it, did you guys not see the first three movies?",7,23 October 2017,"Jurassic World I've got to say that I really enjoyed Jurassic World. Being a huge fan of the original movie and with enough time passed to eradicate the painful memories left by Jurassic Park 3 I was really excited for this latest installment. With a promising cast and after an exciting trailer I sat on the edge of my cinema seat in anticipation. An attempt is made to try and recapture some of the original movies magic. JW manages a little but ultimately cannot live up to the greatness of Spielberg's classic. There's the rousing theme tune accompanied by an altogether equally uplifting new score by Michael Giacchino (John Williams was too busy doing the Force Awakens to return for this one) and there's some supremely polished CGI.If you aren't familiar with the plot on this one here goes. In JW a fully operational theme park is now up and running and has been successful for quite some years now. After the events in the first three movies you would have thought someone would have realised that this isn't such a good idea. However public interest is beginning to dwindle as your average Joe Bloggs is getting bored with regular old dinosaurs. So the science boffins are asked to come up with a new dinosaur. Something bigger, scarier, cooler and with more teeth. This is where this movie starts to fall down. I'm sorry but I may visit the zoo once in a while but never once have I been bored by seeing a lion or giraffe. There on the TV all the time too but never have they been boring. So Im sure a real live dinosaur would blow my socks off. Anyway a new dino is cooked up in the lab. Indominus Rex. An hybrid creature with a set of uncanny abilities and some nasty big teeth. As you've guessed it. The beast escapes, tourists get eaten and we have our new Jurassic Park movie.As entertaining as all this is the movie stumbles because of its own dumbness. If only the script writers would have taken a bit more care over proceedings and we would have had an even better movie. An example being is when the containment team are sent in to retrieve the escaped creature. They merely turn up in a couple of jeeps with a cattle prod and a net! How were they planning on getting the gargantuan monster back to it's pen? I say monster because as Chris Pratt's character says ""she's no dinosaur!"" So because the containment team are a group of stupid individuals they all get eaten. The films big finale is super entertaining but equally as dumb. Our heroes are in peril and about to get devoured by one big dinosaur so their genius plan to help save them is to let out another big dinosaur. Oh dear now you're surrounded by two big dinosaurs! I'm Knit picking here guys because despite the films silliness I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great together. Vincent D'Onofrio was a great villainous character, even if his motive to weaponise Velociraptors was another one of the movies stupid ideas. Irrfan Kahn's character was likable and had integrity but he couldn't fly an helicopter for toffee! Direction and cinematography was good. CGI as you'd expect is second to none. If you're watching on Blu-ray the HD transfer and sound quality is superb. An excellent tester disc for any surround sound system. I gave JW 8/10. Now that's a high score for a dumb movie but sometimes the simple ""take your brain out"" movies are the best. Relax, dumb down and enjoy. Oh and if something chases you...Run!!!",Jurassic World
233,LloydBayer,Jurassic World promises an entertainment high and it delivers with a monstrous bite.,7,17 June 2015,"Some films are critic proof. Sometimes even the most verbose film critics will find themselves in gleeful abandon, for no other reason than pure cinematic indulgence. I know I did. Likewise, Jurassic World will do that to you in the most eye-popping, heart-racing way a tent pole summer movie can.Right off the bat I'll say that after the disastrous Jurassic Park III (2001), this fourth installment has no reason to exist. In fact, Jurassic World is filled with so many inconsistencies, calling it flawed would be an act of kindness. Comprising of uneventful drama about corporate excess and consumer supply and demand, pacing is a major issue during the first half of the film. Symbolic to the film's subtle theme on humanity's greed for bigger and better material possessions, this part of the film is nothing more than a talky filler leading up to the non-stop action saved for the second half. However, the pay-off is extremely gratifying and worth the wait, and it only gets better with each passing minute.Set 22 years after the events of the first film, we are taken back to the Eastern Pacific island of Isla Nublar, where the titular theme park has reopened and is once again a major tourist attraction. In the tradition of preceding films, the story revolves around a female protagonist, this time park operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) who believes in enticing tourists with newer attractions. Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is replaced by Bollywood thespian Irrfan Khan as Simon Masrani, the new owner of Jurassic World. Masrani is uneasy about Dearing's new attraction – a bigger and meaner hybrid creation called Indominus Rex. For the cinema audience, this aptly relates to a bigger, louder and scarier prehistoric monster. Wish granted! Even before Indominus is released as an 'attraction', expert Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) discovers something abnormal about this new creature. And so it begins like it always does – an accident is shrugged off as a near-miss incident. It should have been a warning. When the second accident occurs, it's already too late.Running, screaming and utter pandemonium forms the rest of the film, punctuated with the occasional yet distinctive sound of a predatory 'chomp'. This is when the film lifts off with blistering pace thanks to well executed action, suspense driven terror and technical achievements that include fluid animatronics, and fantastic visual and sound design. Production design is also massive in keeping with original author Michael Crichton's intricately detailed world in the Jurassic Park novel. In only his second foray as director, it's safe to say that Colin Trevorrow has done his homework, especially with special effects bigwig Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as executive producer. Look out for two new ferocious creatures and an old favorite brought back for an amazing finale. And just to appease fans of monster movies, Trevorrow also interjects the action with several references to the first film, along with memorable scenes from King Kong (2005) and even James Cameron's Aliens (1986). Although this doesn't say much about originality, it still works as solid aid to the entertainment factor. On the downside, and if there is a weak link in human characterization, it would have to be Howard's stereotypical damsel in distress. Only here, her character is written off as a pushy corporate executive who can outrun ravenous dinosaurs with high heels! On the other hand, Pratt anchors the film with an Indiana Jones getup and is genuinely engaging throughout. Cocky yet equally charismatic, this is an actor highly capable of becoming the next Tom Cruise.That said, Jurassic World and its older siblings have never been about an actor's depth. It's all about the dinosaurs and their fight for supremacy in the food chain. After all, these were creatures of calamity but also creatures that dominated the planet long before we did. Bringing them back to full celluloid life is where this film excels and by the looks of it, no expense was spared. In other words, if there's one film that gives you your money's worth this summer, this is it and does so in Jurassic proportions.",Jurassic World
234,sunznc,Good but nothing original here,8,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World as a stand alone film is good. Had I not seen the previous Jurassic films I would have enjoyed this, found it entertaining. I find this a nice addition to the previous three films. The acting is excellent by all, the production high. Only issue I have is that nothing new really happens. People show up at Jurassic World, something goes wrong, people die and the park is ruined. Same format, same formula, no real new ideas. Can't blame the writers for this. What else could be done with the story? One other issue I have with the film is that it doesn't really build up as much tension as the previous. There are a few moments here and there that do but when one of the characters is in a very dangerous situation, there is a lack of build-up, a lack of suspense. All in all very good but not all that original.",Jurassic World
235,peefyn,Blames the audience,6,27 June 2015,"I liked the dinosaurs, didn't mind the CGI (but would have preferred animatronics), and I would probably prefer that it did not go over the top so often. And then there's the gender issues. And the stupidity of all the characters. All of this is very much out in the open.What is more interesting, is to see all the effort the filmmakers put into acknowledging the expectations of the audience, and responding to the expected reactions they would have to the plot.One of the first scenes acknowledges the feathers-or-no-feathers-situation, and they make passing mentions to it later on in the movie as well. The same goes with the over the top plot of the movie, which it acknowledges and comments on. But it all falls kind of flat,a s it only acknowledges the choices they have made, but do not really comment on them. For instance, it makes fun of naming dinosaurs after products, but still features product placement heavily. It mentions how the audience always expect more and more, and the only way to make them happy is to give them more. Which is what this movie does just after.Basically: It acknowledges the challenges of making Jurassic Park 4, but rather than provide a solution, the movie gives up and blames the audience for wanting what it gives us.That said: It's a fun movie. It's hard to go wrong with dinosaurs and Pratt. But I wish they had higher ambitions.",Jurassic World
236,p-jonsson,Decent Hollywood entertainment,7,22 October 2015,"The last movie review I made I started off by saying it was a movie you mostly watched for the special effects. Well this one is pretty much the same. The plot is pretty much predictable. The characters are fairly mediocre. The bad guy is a standard Hollywood villain which means that he is utterly despicable but boringly predictable and serves little more purpose than instilling bad feeling, which of course he does pretty well.The movie starts 22 years after the original theme part met its premature demise. The ""you should not play good"" prophets can say what they want, I think the idea of reviving the Dinosaurs (without the reckless gene manipulation stuff) is a quite cool one and I would certainly endorse the idea of they could make it work. I really do not care much for the nonsensical stories of these movies where there is always some thoroughly stupid Hollywood villain that screws things up with some ludicrous evil scheme but, unfortunately a lot of people seems to buy into that stuff and think it is ""what could happen"".Anyway, having said that, the story is not bad for this kind of movie. It generally holds together although the stupid plot of the main villain really did (censored) me off. It was the usual dumb-ass stuff where you could see where things were going from the moment the dumb-ass in question opened his mouth.I did like the hero although I was pretty much a stereotype one. I did not really like the equally stereotype woman lead character and I certainly felt that the silly nonsense about a couple in the process of divorcing sending their kids for a vacation with their aunt who obviously is not interested in the well being of the kids. Typical soap opera material.This is a special effects movie and the special effects where not bad. I would not say that they where wow impressive but then that might be due to special effects overload. Today you are so used to wonderful special effects that it takes a lot to impress you. At the time when the original Jurassic movie was released one would have gone all wow over the effects in this movie but today they are just ""just"" what one would expect. Still good though.If you are looking for a good plot, well then you are going to be disappointed. It is pretty much standard, brain-dead, Hollywood fare in that department. I really fail to understand why they constantly fail to provide anything remotely intelligent in terms of plot. Are the average audience really that stupid? Well, having offloaded that bit of frustration, and parked my brain in the closet, I did indeed enjoy the movie. It was pretty much what I expected nothing more, nothing less.",Jurassic World
237,rooee,We're gonna need a bigger park,3,11 June 2015,"Jurassic Park is now 22 years old yet still holds up thanks to well-rounded characters, an explorative script, expert direction, and a less-is-more attitude to CGI. The two sequels offered dismally diminishing returns, culminating in the shark-jumping raptor-chat of part III; so the sight of Starlord hunting with a pack of pet dinosaurs in the trailers for Jurassic World did not bode well. What did bode well was something that's been surprisingly overlooked in the series up to this point: The presence of an actual, functioning dinosaur theme park. This instalment returns us to Isla Nublar for the first time since Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking first film. Indeed, Jurassic World unashamedly uses the original movie as its template and sole predecessor. A wise move... on paper, at least. This time our Alan and Ellie are Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard; the kids are Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson); the Hammond role goes to Irrfan Khan as rich boy Masrani; and the new Nedry is Vic (Vincent D'Onofrio). The Jurassic Park incident has been buried, and Jurassic World has been operating without incident for years. But the visitors are bored and want bigger, louder, toothier. So Henry Wu (B D Wong, the only surviving cast member from the first film) creates Indominus rex, a genetically-spliced monster which basically amounts to a T-rex with less dinky arms. Suffice to say, a breakout is imminent. The kids get lost in the wild and Owen and Claire head out to save them. Meanwhile, Vic senses an opportunity to do the Weyland-Yutani thing and seize the dinosaurs for use as weapons. Good luck with that. Obviously Indominus rex embodies the idea that the entertainment industry constantly needs bigger 'n' louder products to keep the dollar signs rolling. It's a flash of satire but really it amounts to a, like, totally awesome new monster smashing stuff up. Relentlessly. Boringly. Jurassic World ruthlessly indulges what it seeks to satirise. It criticises corporate logic yet is just as disingenuous and bloated as any other Marvel-ised multiplex factory product. It smashes up its gift shops but has the depth of a plastic toy. It would leave a bad taste if it weren't so tasteless. Director Colin Tevorrow's previous credit was Safety Not Guaranteed, and Jurassic World serves as a lesson in why you don't hand the reins of a big budget behemoth to an indie guy. The direction is static and lifeless. The action is adequate but rendered tame by a staggering absence of tension-building. Visceral setpieces are connected with floss. The dialogue is as thudding and clunky as a brachiosaurus with a club foot. It took four people to write this trash – I wonder if the legal wrangling over the screenplay credits was to take their names off the poster. The characters are dull cardboard cut-outs. Pratt is stolidly sincere as the ex-Navy jock who starts and ends as a badass. Dallas Howard channels Lindsey Brigman from The Abyss as tight-ass Claire – but even Lindsey got to loosen up and take her heels off in the end. The kids... who knows? I guess they're meant to represent the indifference of youth, which as an audience experience translates as indifference as to whether they live or die. Then there's Masrani, who starts by criticising Claire for chasing the dollar and moments later gives the non-lethal order because the rampant dinosaur cost him X million bucks. Bad, bad writing. It's not just the words that sound lame. Michael Giacchino is occasionally hailed as the new John Williams, yet the only notes of distinction in his score are those of Williams himself. There's a great moment early on when young Gray swings back the balcony doors and we see the park and that music soars... But it's a false dawn, as we're subsequently lumped with scene after lumbering scene scored with indistinct music which sounds like it was 65 minutes in the making. Whether we can and whether we should were the Big Questions posed by author Michael Crichton. The reason the original story was so potent is because it took a distant scientific possibility and brought it intriguingly into a plausible reality. That's science fiction, folks, and that's why a single shot of a lagoon could produce such wonder and awe. But tantalising possibility is not drama enough anymore, it seems. Today we are at a point where anything is possible with CGI so the tendency is to throw everything at the screen. And in this new World, by the final reel, with its risible monster mash showdown, you realise everything has been thrown and nothing has stuck. As a work of storytelling it's as vaporous as dino-breath on a window. As a JP sequel it's just as bad as the others. Maybe it's time to close the doors on Hammond's glorious vision. It just isn't working out.",Jurassic World
238,xamtaro,I miss Spielberg......,6,28 June 2015,"Jurassic World. The culmination of a dream that began with the ill fated Jurassic Park. Technology has allowed scientists to extract DNA and clone the once extinct thunder lizards. Where Jurassic Park was an old school safari, Jurassic world is the highly commercialised Disneyland with Dinosaurs, where paying customers could kayak down a river of feeding Brontosaurs, ride a gyro-sphere among the Triceratops, pay a fortune for a cola, and just bask in the awe of these great creatures. But test audience did not want raptors the size of a turkey or T-rex with feathers so in cam frog DNA to make them look like how they do in the books and minds of people. People did not just want to ""bask in awe"" so the dinosaurs were turned into sideshow freaks and made to entertain with their babies being molested in petting zoos, their basic mealtimes making the Facebook page of a hundred gawking audience members. Heck, some even tried training them to do tricks but even that is not enough. Enter the Indominus Rex, a genetically spliced mutant dinosaur.What we have here is something that would split the audience. Some would call it an abomination, others would call it awesome. It is bigger, louder, fiercer, faster, yet it feels hollow and incomplete; all style and less substance. It's got teeth, its got a ferocious roar, but it lacks bite. A creature whose traits were dictated by focus groups and market research instead of a respect for the originals. A creature made of borrowed elements from the originals yet the guys who made it forgot what it was that made the originals so great and memorable.I am talking about the movie here. The very movie which the Indominus Rex acts like a parody of. No one are impressed with old school animatronic effects the same way people in the movie are not too impressed with the old school Tyrannosaurus Rex. So in came modern technology, in the movie's case in came 3D CGI, and the creators went wild with it. Some say they went overboard with it the same way scientists went overboard with the predatory trails of the Indominus Rex.Someone is making a point here it seems. Very clever. Whether it was intended or not, Jurassic World is exactly the kind of blockbuster movie that the indominus Rex was meant to parody. It is bigger in scale, with CGI special effects used to portray the fully functioning theme park and creatures within. It is fiercer, with more on screen deaths, there is more gore to push the PG13 rating and we finally get to see what would happen when soldiers fight dinosaurs. It is definitely faster; though clocking in at 124 minutes, I felt that the movie just flew by like Pterodactyl.Somewhere in there there is this kid and his teenage brother. Their aunt runs Jurassic World and starts off as an obnoxious ""corporate adult too busy for the kids"" type. There's is this funny Indian billionaire who loves flying helicopters, and then there is Star-Lord! Look it's Peter ""StarLord"" Quill and he's training Velociraptors instead of hanging out with a talking racoon and his alien tree. Wait.......he's not Star Lord? Owen Grady, you say? But he is the exact same Star Lord character, right down to the mannerisms, the body language, except that instead of a laser gun, ""Owen"" here has a hunting rifle. You're not fooling anyone Star- Lord.Simple statement: If I can't even remember your characters names, then those characters are not at all interesting. Sadly the rest of what made Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park great gets lost in messy frantic CGI action. Spielberg allowed the camera to linger on the dinosaurs, keeping things out of frame to ramp up the tension then delivering full on, clear and steady dino fighting action. Colin Trevorrow, on the other hand, seems to have taken reference from Michael Bay and JJ Abrams. Frantic camera shots neuter the dinosaur action, wide shots are so wide that you can't make out much detail, and keeping the dinos out of frame just feel like those old low budget cheats to save on the special effects budget. You even have wholly unnecessary lens flare on jeep headlights.Not that the CGI was perfect, it is not. Industral Lights and Magic (ILM) does great effects for technology (see Star Wars, Transformers, Iron Man etc) but when it comes to creatures, they fall short from the standards set by studios like WETA or MPC. It shows in the overly saturated shots of dinosaurs in the daytime. For example, the initial appearance of the velociraptors seemed a tad unfinished with the raptors looking a little out of focus from the rest of the scene.I give this thumbs up for the music, the acting and jab at the state of modern blockbusters. The family theme was good though underdeveloped and that CGI could use some work. Re-watching Jurassic Park immediately after this only brought a sense of disappointment to my heart. Even judged by modern standards, Jurassic Park stands the test of time. While Jurassic World may never achieve that timeless classic standard, it entertains it jolts, and it gives the modern blockbuster audience exactly what they want. Sadly.",Jurassic World
239,room102,Meh,4,14 September 2015,"So I watched it at the cinema. In 3D. And it's... meh...First of all, the 3D was very tiresome for my eyes. Never happened to me before, definitely not on such level. Maybe also has to do with the fact that I didn't sleep well at night and was pretty tired (almost fell asleep a few times during the movie).The movie itself is pretty boring, so basically we're left with CGI, which is pretty good, but that doesn't make a movie you enjoy watching. Lots of dinosaur action scenes, some people getting killed - but you wouldn't care for any of them.At one point I thought I was watching ""Aliens"" - it was if the screenwriter took the script for ""Aliens"" and used it word for word. I'm speaking of the scene in which the people at the command center are watching the ""military"" guys fighting, each has his own POV camera and a heart monitor - the situation is IDENTICAL and so is pretty much the dialog too.At another point I thought I was watching ""Alien Resurrection"", with the main dinosaur being a hybrid of a T-Rex, a cuttlefish, a Frog and a raptor. It's a new kind of the species, made by genetic modification/hybrid.What I mostly liked about the movie was the vision of ""Jurassic World"" as a fully working theme park. It had some nice touches there, with some nice attractions, some of them are just as gimmicky/clichéd as you'd expect from a theme park.Of the cast, Chris Pratt is the only one doing a worthy acting job. Vincent D'Onofrio wastes his amazing talent, as expected.It was actually a noon-screening, so there were lots of children too, which seemed to enjoy it although I thought some scenes could too intense/scary for them.All in all, it's an average movie at best.",Jurassic World
240,in1984,Pet the Dinosaurs,8,17 June 2015,"8 of 10. Solid action/monster/horror/sci-fi film all by itself regardless of whether it's a sequel. Starts out as a sort of zoo visit where you watch cute people pet the exotic animals. All very cute. The more fitting, and maybe too misleading for the film as a whole, would be Jurassic Pets.Just when it seems everything is contained and cute, you realize you may be watching a more realistic prequel or actual Godzilla (2014) film, which was good but dependent on more science fiction stretches than this.What it adds to the Jurassic series is more realistic, as mentioned pettable/touchable, dinosaur visual FX and a more realistic follow-up to the original film, especially one taking place 20 years later. It doesn't ignore the original, but rather embraces it and integrates what happened there into the story. It also adds the missing sea/ocean dinos and some believable technology to observe and run with dinosaurs. The adult relationships are also more complex/realistic than the original (though also some unnecessary melodrama). Finally, the key aspect, genetic engineering of the dinosaurs that leads to the dangers, monsters, and action.",Jurassic World
241,ericrnolan,"My review of ""Jurassic World"" (2015), with Bryce Dallas HowAreYaDarling",8,15 June 2015,"""Jurassic World"" (2015) was raptortastic and T-Rexific. It was also fun in another way, but I can't think of a pun for ""Indominus Rex."" I'd give it an 8 out of 10.Seriously — this was a fun monster movie. (I, for one, maintain that these are horror-sci-fi movies at heart, and not the family adventure films that others seem to take them for. Even the theme music for this entire franchise seems to insist that a zippity good time was had by all, after dinosaurs devour adults and traumatize lost children.)The kid in me thrilled to this movie's great outstanding special effects and abundance of monsters. Those raptors are the coolest movie monsters since Aliens and Predators.The action sequences were wonderful. Did anyone else think the initial attack/ambush was an homage to the initial attack/ambush in ""Aliens"" (1986)? They have the heart rate monitors and helmet-cams and everything. I kept waiting for Corporal Hicks to yell, ""DRAKE, WE ARE LEAVING!!!""The aerial attack by the winged dinosaurs was outstanding. (I don't know the difference between pterodactyls and pteranodons. Besides, one of them looked like it had a T-Rex head, and I'm not sure that was even was a thing.) The plight of one plucked victim was pretty damn creative and horrifying — I think that entire sequence was an example of some pretty inspired horror filmmaking.And all of those things are good, because I honestly don't think this film has much going for it without them. This really is  pretty much the same story as ""Jurassic Park"" (1993).Smart people do stupid things. I got a ""C"" in biology freshman year, but even a guy like me immediately doubts the wisdom of the Raptor Recruiting Plan. I also have no military experience, but I know what ""cover"" is, and I know what a ""kill zone"" is, and I wouldn't rush from the former to stand stationary in the latter.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas HowAboutADrinkLater are both very good actors; this movie's script has them rattling off humorous lines that are typical of a mediocre sitcom. The character concept for Pratt's hunky-extreme-sportsman-naturalist raptor-whisperer is kind of silly. Bryce Dallas HowDoYouJustKeepGettingPrettier plays another stock character — the two-dimensional uptight corporate princess who needs to be taken down a notch. Their banter is like the dialogue of a lackluster episode of ""Friends,"" and it insults the viewers' intelligence.The movie's two most interesting characters are the two young brothers. Their dialogue was actually touching — this movie would be far better it had focused almost entirely on them. (And, yes, that is young Ty Simpkins from ""Insidious."")I keep seeing articles on the Internet alleging that the technology depicted by these movies will soon be possible, but I pretty much don't believe anything I read on the net anymore. Because I totally bought into that Mars One fiasco, and now I feel like an idjit.",Jurassic World
242,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,11 June 2015,"Despite not being the biggest Jurassic Park fan I was still looking forward to this film. I wanted to have a ride, the buzz was positive and I really wanted to see how the park opened looked like. My expectations were't sky high, I really just wanted to have that thrilling ride that the first one offered. The movie doesn't manage to meet that standard, but still has enough going on for it not to be defined a faliure.The premise of having the park open definitely delivers some great moments, of which truthfully I would have liked to see more. The ride it takes you through has its stumbles, but overall I was never out of it and it had enough good, and just a couple of amazing, set pieces to keep the pace going. I cannot deny that despite the many times I got phased out by what happened on screen, there were as many times were I got genuinely excited and thrilled. I have to give a shout out to the sound design and mixing of the film because it is definitely the part that is resonating the most with me whilst writing this review. Much more than CGI, which I will get into later, it added a real layer to the film and astonishingly helped getting me engaged. It is great to hear the original theme back and I just might think it wasn't used enough. To sum up the positives in the best way possible: the parts that worked, really worked.The rest was all just: ""Well OK, I am sure I will forget this the second I exit the film"". The premise of the film isn't neither original or interesting nor grounded enough for it ever to be truly relevant. It's just another dinosaur and that would be OK if it wasn't inserted in this plot that a couple too many and convenient times strayed away from credibility. Moreover the themes it is trying to explore are frustratingly and repeatedly put aside. The CGI is just forgettable unfortunately. There are maybe a couple of shiny moments, but other than being somewhat underwhelming it really is just too poorly used for it to provoke any sense of wonder or amazement in 2015, I am really sorry, CGI has to be used as a gift not as a gadget and it is what this film did. And on the final negative note, you are given a group of way too generic characters, they seemed to have been pre-fabricated in the factory of generic blockbusters. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who really gives her character a beat and a presence on screen making her likable, all of the characters I really couldn't care that much and it made for repeatedly poor stakes.I unfortunately can't say I really had that much fun. I was never bored and really enjoyed quite a few moments, but truthfully I was far from having any sense of wonder or amazement and I think the positive reaction the film is having is due more to the fact that we all desperately want ""Jurassic Park"" to be good again more than the actual quality of the film.",Jurassic World
243,markgorman,Jurassic World: Thomas Hardy Reimagined for the 23rd century.,7,7 July 2015,"Let's face it, this is basically just Far From the Madding Crowd with dinosaurs instead of sheep.Think about it.

They appear to be about to live happily ever after but their love is not consummated on screen. That Ladies and gentlemen is the story of Far From the Madding Crowd; and of Jurassic World.But it's so much more than this of course.

244,scottshak_111,A joyride back in time!,7,13 June 2015,"Colin Trevorrow is no Spielberg. Yet he tries to nail an awesome project into the right groove. Jurassic World is a constantly entertaining, at times dramatic, thrilling joyride into the lost dino theme. We are introduced to the most dreadful, villainous and invincible creatures of all times, Indominus Rex, the hybrid that manifests multiple traits. She is relentless, aggressive, highly intelligent and untamable and she kills for sport. Things look pretty bad right there, huh! Wait till you see the other pack of dinos that Jurassic World hatches.The story of the movie is technically quite similar to the originals however it races in as a sequel to them. The plot is a little bit predictable but Trevorrow manages to unfurl it gorgeously at the right dire moments.SPOILERS AHEAD:Dinosaurs are living things. They can communicate, understand each other, work as a team to topple the bad and avenge! Jurassic World runs on this very theme. It also exalts the brave, with Chris Pratt doing us the honours under the skin of Owen Grady, a relentless bad- ass who would do anything to save lives. A messed-up Claire played by Bryce Dallas Howard who thinks these animals are mere assets that don't feel a thing, however has a change of heart at a later stage when she sympathizes with one. Two kids who are on their holiday to explore the park and a lot of tourists who are there just for fun. Irrfan Khan does a brilliant job as Masrani with his engaged acting. Vincent D'Onofrio too does a fine job with his character trying to milk opportunities. BD Wong has a short but powerful cameo and reprises his role as Dr. Henry Wu.There are many Easter eggs in the flick that would throw you into the pits of nostalgia. Many references are made to Hammond and his mistakes, a revisit to the previous Jurassic Park place, the aviary aftermath with Pteranodons, ruthless Velociraptors, the red burning flare, the unflinching T-Rex and the deafening triumphant growl of the Rex everything simply takes you back in time.Screenplay is well written if we concentrate only the first half of the movie. There are brilliant conversations between Masrani, Wu, Hoskins and Owen that pack in the dramatic quotient to the flick.The movie however fails to revive the fear that all its prequels breathed on. Nobody is really afraid of dinosaurs. With Pratt doing ballsy stuff, you suddenly aren't afraid of dinosaurs. Next thing you know even Claire goes on to summon a frigging T-Rex with a flare. We used to pee our pants with a Velociraptor around, and they are literally dancing with the dinos! Kids in the movie too don't have much to do in the climactic scenes. Nature plays survival of the fittest once again and humans become mere spectators of destruction. In the end it boils down to teamwork and overpowering your killer instinct like valued lessons for humans which become a little indigestible.After the attack of the Pterosaurs, the movie tries to dive into the dark from where things become a little shoddy. Editing goes a little poor there considering the classic frame cuts in the first half. Profundity in the characters of Claire and Owen loses its charm, and suddenly Owen is open for some Hoskins change. Claire's change of heart has no gravity or a backdrop screenplay to nail the effect. There is no scientific rendezvous unlike its prequel. Also, sometimes you wish the family drama to be a bit engaging. Some flaws pop up too but apart from these little things the movie is a complete entertaining package into the past.Watch and reminisce!",Jurassic World
245,HelenMary,Masterful sequel. Entertaining and visually exciting,7,9 July 2015,"Remember Jurassic Park? How creepy it was? And original? Okay this doesn't totally match up to the first, but it comes very close. We're familiar with the big beasties but Jurassic World goes one step further and makes humans interact with them. Enter, the rather delectable Chris Pratt as the Raptor Whisperer who - of course - tries to save the day. Possibly more interesting than the earlier films in the series, as it's got more sensible behavioral ecology/science and quite interesting thoughts on the environment and our responsibility in it. Pratt is believable and controlling. He owns the screen. He has good chemistry with the animals (okay they're CGI so that's a bit of a stretch) and co-stars. D'onofrio and Dallas-Howard were worthy of the film and the entire cast did very well - especially the child stars. It didn't have the fear-factor and visceral tension of the first film - nothing will beat Ariana Richards' screaming - and I was a little disappointed not to see Jeff Goldblum as a cameo - but it took the franchise to a whole new level. Amazing SFX - the animals were beautiful. Really enjoyed the film, super-entertaining and a good evening out at the cinema. A big screen film for sure.",Jurassic World
246,coreyjdenford,Do you think he saur-us?,8,12 June 2015,This review is going to be completely spoiler free. Jurassic World is full of giants and what I mean by that is giant dinosaurs. Jurassic World is set 22 years after Jurassic Park and in this film they have genetically modified dinosaurs which makes them intelligent. Let me tell you what is good about this film (spoiler free).The film is very pretty and futuristic and it is filled to the brim with CGI. The film has some funny moments that just make you giggle. The dinosaurs have feelings and also you get the sense of scale in this film. The story is set well and is definitely going to take over Jurassic Park 2 and 3 which were in my opinion just over the top and poor.Bad points about this film is the bad dialogue and also some very small plot holes and very awkward moments and in my opinion is quite dark and gory especially to the fact that it is a 12A (PG-13) but overall this is a dinosaur of a film.The story is set around two brothers aged around 17 and 12 Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) who go off to an island called Jurassic World they go there on a holiday set by their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the two brothers have such a fun time then eventually it all goes wrong. Then the story goes to another character Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who was in the Navy signed up for Jurassic World to train some raptors specifically four but again it goes wrong. Zach and Gray go off on their own adventure without their Aunt Claire they basically have their own responsibilities. Eventually the park get's overrun and everything just goes wrong. Now the hybrid dinosaur not the one seen on the Jurassic World is literally colossal over fifty feet long and she is extremely intelligent and smell people from a mile away but that is enough about that.Finally this film is spectacular. 10/10. A must see.,Jurassic World
247,kgprophet,Old Fashioned Creature Scares instead of Uber-CGI,6,12 June 2015,"After the seemingly unneeded critics review embargo lifted, I started reading through the reviews to get an idea of what was in store for JP4 (or JW4?). One reviewer hit upon the appeal of the original movie, was that it created a world where you could actually believe they made dinosaurs. None of the technology depicted looked like fantasy, and none of the activities of the dinosaurs defied the laws of gravity. Fast-forward 22 years, and filmmakers seem to be obliged to give us over-the-top, causing realism to get tossed out the window. The other thing lost on modern CGI spectacle films is the sense of tension. Here, after years of tinkering, Spielberg carefully crafts new set pieces that can still get you jumpy. Also credit the careful effects work, the CGI contains enough animal characteristics to feel realistic. One of the new conventions that I don't disagree with these days is not even bothering to create characters that you are going to care for. Another recent blockbuster ""San Andreas"" disposed of the formalities and went straight into havoc mode. Here we don't get preachy or run through the obligatory checklist of all cliché characters and their cliché hangups. We still get stuck with a strange subplot about weaponizing the technology in regards to breeding Dino-Soldiers. Believe me it was supposed to be worse.So I congratulate the filmmakers for being more concerned about creating a film that holds some good scares than trying to make it about bigger CGI. Nevertheless, all the wide shots of the theme park, and stuff like the monorail, looked like CG models. It was also interesting to see effects shots that were in the trailer many months ago looking very different in the final film after they were all 'cleaned up'. One thing you wish could be improved upon is the intelligence quotient of the cast. It's OK if some of your expendable cast does some illogical things, but you should expect your main characters to act intelligently to keep the audience with you. It's these intelligent moments that are missing that makes you appreciate the original creation by Spielberg and how infrequent such a well crafted film comes about (I saw JP four times in the theatre when it first came out).The scary moments in JW are borrowed directly from the film Aliens, which is not such a bad thing. I remember enjoying some good scares in that monster film. There are many borrowed moments from the first Jurassic Park, including the tear-jerking animatronic dying dinosaur breathing it's last breath. But why throw in the holograms? Most things they showed in this film I could buy as present day technology. But in the main pavilion they show 3D holograms of dinosaurs walking around. Of course 3D holograms that you can walk around and see a complete 360 degrees does not exist. It was too bad they decided to toss this in, it made the film more about CGI eye candy than realism.All the acting was competent, it was just too bad that they had such flimsy setups to work with. Problems with jumps in time and many events happening off screen created a choppy attempt at creating empathy between relatives. Still, the scary sequences still work because the filmmakers know how to make you squirm. Fans of Chris Pratt will be glad to hear he somehow can eke out some charisma despite so little to go on. Less so for Bryce Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio, who are trapped in their cliché roles. And poor Judy Greer, looking to show some acting range, has to literally phone it in. Ty Simpkins, the kid from Ironman 3, is allowed to respond intelligently and had the best chance at keeping the audience grounded. Less said for the third act, where Chris Pratt needs to take charge and be the connecting thread for all the final showstoppers.This film ultimately gets a thumbs up, and could be possibly one of the best of the summer films in terms of getting the most thrills for your buck. Perhaps Hollywood is finally hearing our complaints about Summer Films getting over-bloated and testing our patience by going over the 2 hour mark. Jurassic World benefits from this. Good pacing on the one hand means large chunks of story go missing, but it means you get out of the theatre before your attention span wanes.",Jurassic World
248,Ramascreen,"Welcome.. to my REVIEW of ""Jurasic World""",8,10 June 2015,"I'm going to be honest with ya, I didn't think JURASSIC WORLD was going to be this awesome, and I was mostly basing that on how terrible ""Jurassic Park 3"" was and how to this day it still leaves a bad impression. But JURASSIC WORLD blew my mind. One of the many reasons is because it truly captures everything, and I mean literally everything that we loved about the first film. The first film will always be a timeless masterpiece, hands down, nothing can ever change that and this JURASSIC WORLD is a sequel, not a reboot, but in many ways, it pays homage to the first one, and because of that, it may leave room for some predictability, because the stories and the themes are more or less similar, but the designs and the executions by director Colin Trevorrow's team, complimented by today's advanced VFX, all of that results in awe-inspiring breathtaking sequences, you can't even look away from some of its intense scary moments because they're such a sight to behold, majestic in every sense of the word. Not only does JURASSIC WORLD revive this franchise, it restores our childhood's passion and love for dinosaurs. As soon as that John Williams' music hits the screen, the minute you hear it, you're immediately taken back to 1993, any additional notes by composer Michael Giacchino are only there in service of that.If you recalled, in the first movie, there's a shot of the T-Rex attacking the kids from up above by pressing down against the glass roof of that iconic ""Jurassic Park"" jeep, in this one, there's a similar scene involving a new high-tech multi-terrain vehicle called gyrosphere. In the first one, the kids were separated from the adults, forcing a small search and rescue mission to happen, and the kids were related to John Hammond who owned the place. Something similar also happens in JURASSIC WORLD and the kids are related to Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, who pretty much runs the place. In the first movie, John Hammond thought he had it all figured out and under control, that nothing could go wrong under his watch, well, multiply that by two, and you have Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire who refuses to believe that there are things in life that she just couldn't handle, it would take a lot for that to finally go through her thick skull. Those are some of the many examples of what I mean by JURASSIC WORLD capturing everything that we loved about the first film. It brings back that excitement and wonder.I remember when the first JURASSIC WORLD preview hit the web, we thought to ourselves, o, man they're making a genetically engineered dinosaurs now?! When will these guys ever learn?! O sheesh, here we go again and so we thought that we were in for nothing but a big new dino villain, and that that's all that they were going to throw into the story and that was going to be it, just like the second movie was all about putting T-Rex in San Diego and the third one was about this ugly lookin' spinosaurus and that was it. But nope, JURASSIC WORLD is so much more. Colin and his team made sure that the human characters feel real, that their story feel real, first and foremost, and so then the threat that comes from this new dino villain, Indominus Rex feels even more present. They made sure that this fully functional JURASSIC WORLD theme park looks close to what John Hammond may have envisioned and so much more, that when you witness some of the attractions or the human - dinosaur encounters, it makes you want to go to that place so bad, nothing else matters.Chris Pratt's character, Owen, is such an ultimate badass in this film. If you thought Star-Lord/Peter Quill was cool, get a hold of this guy, Owen, because when the chips are down, he's the guy you'd want to have on your side if you want to live to see tomorrow. And Pratt plays it straight. By the way, about that whole riding with the raptors scene, it's not about taming them, I think the movie depicts these raptors like they're some kind of a pack of big wild wolves, there's some kind of mutual respect between Owen and them, but they could still attack and kill Owen at any time if they want to. And after seeing this film, I've come to the conclusion that it may have been too early and unfair for Joss Whedon to have labeled that one particular scene as sexist, and at times Bryce Dallas Howard's performance can be a bit wooden, but it actually goes along with her character, it speaks about her character, Claire. Psychologists might see Claire as someone who puts up a big wall around herself. I think Bryce does a good job, although you'll crack up at her running around from dinosaurs while wearing high heels. And my goodness, this new big bad Dino villain, Indominus Rex is pretty much the ultimate mutant, she's a mix of a lot of things, which is why she could even think two or three steps ahead of the humans, she's manipulative, she's a schemer, she's a fighter, a hunter, anything in her path will die, she's scary as hell, I-Rex is this year's invincible villain. But the movie has an epic climactic scene that would solve all the problems but you have to sit through the whole thing to see it, and so if you have doubts, if you have concerns, if you have your reservations about JURASSIC WORLD, I don't blame ya, but I invite you to just allow yourselves be entertained by what Colin and his guys have crafted for ya, keep an open mind and I guarantee you're going to have a jurassic fun time at the theaters.",Jurassic World
249,jawneyfloros,an updated sequel to Jurassic Park,2,19 November 2018,Review: I was disappointed with this movie because I expected a hell of a lot more from a Jurassic park based movie. The direction and screenplay are both sub-par. The casting and acting wasn't bad. Chris Pratt gave a stand alone good performance as an adult version of Owen the little boy from the original Jurassic park. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.,Jurassic World
250,gary-444,A decent effort- but the franchise is moribund,5,2 November 2015,"The fourth in the ""Jurassic"" series, this film has divided opinion. It is easy to understand why.As an addition to the series it is derivative, clichéd, lazy and half baked. As a stand- alone action film it is rather good.The problem with the series is that the original brought together great writing with Michael Crichton, a great idea, ground breaking special effects, and Spielberg. That is a potent combination.Four down the line, there is no Michael Crichton, no original idea, great special effects and no Spielberg. The wonder has gone.Which if you are checking out the series for the first time, is fine. Bryce Dallas Howard is hot, Chris Pratt is handsome, and there are lots of dinosaur moments eating each others, and humans. Yet once you have seen the dinosaurs doing their thing, and the genetically modified super dinosaur doing his/her thing, the tension drops, and on an island, there are only so many people you can eat. The jeopardy isn't really there. A risible sub plot of a team developing raptors for military purposes is, risible. The breathy claim that they could have worked wonders in Tora Bora is just stupid.The original was a great film, this is just good entertainment. There is nothing wrong with that.",Jurassic World

Soon we will be getting Fallen Kingdom and I'm sure it'll be good. There were also good scenes and well-done sets for the amusement park. Even if you haven't seen the original, give this a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you like dinosaurs in a modern setting, this is where to look.",Jurassic World
253,gavinp9,An exciting return-to-form for the series - there will be more!,8,2 January 2018,"'Jurassic World' (or Jurassic Park 4) is set 22 years after the original film (and 14 years after the last film), on the same Costa Rican island, with it now a fully-functioning theme park. Why anyone would open or invest in it after the events is another story altogether and never really mentioned! Owen (Pratt) is the Sam Neil replacement and is charming and solid throughout and Claire (Dallas Howard) is the Laura Dern replacement and becomes less stuck-up and annoying as the film progresses. Jake Johnson (Nick off 'New Girl') is great as the computer tech in the control room and gets a few funny moments - a more than admirable job as the Jeff Goldblum replacement!The film keeps a similar formula to 'Jurassic Park' - two kids, a concerned parent-figure (but not the actual parents - why are they never with their kids?), a dinosaur escaping and everyone running for their lives! There's some nice throwbacks to the original too - the score motifs, the kids stumble into the foyer of the memorable final scene, the original/distinctive jeeps are seen, Dr Wu - the geneticist - is played by the same actor, Hammond is mentioned a few times and there's a heard of Gallimimus at one point. I was glad to see more Stegosaurs and also to see Ankylosaurs for the first time in the series.My main issue was the similarity to some aspects of 'Jurassic Park III' - there's a dinosaur bigger than Tyrannosaurus Rex that kills everything; there's Pteranodons that get loose and their consequences never properly dealt with; and the Velociraptors aren't really treated as vicious killing machines until it's needed in the story. However, it doesn't really need to make much sense when there's so many great moments of tension, then action, then surprise throughout - and some genuine wonder with the Deinosuchus in the Sea World part. A well done final scene(s) cap off an enjoyable experience.",Jurassic World
254,GeorgeRoots,"The Best Sequel Since The First Movie, But Boy Does It Punish You The More You Think About It.",6,25 June 2015,"What is there to say about ""Jurassic World""? Did we really need it? And will it stand out from any of the other noticeable summer blockbusters of 2015? Well I'll get this out in the open first and foremost, I didn't really plan on seeing it. Let's just say ""The Lost World"" (1997) and ""Jurassic Park 3"" (2001), didn't really leave the franchise on a high note 14 years ago. I could only hope that this one would prove to be popular enough to make its obvious large amounts of money, and somewhat shake up the narrative of ""Dinosaurs escaping captivity"".Though the dates are never referenced throughout the movie, there is a line that really bugged me when the park's operations manager says something to the effect of ""People have lost interest in Dinosaurs"", to which I could only react with a highly raised eyebrow and a chuckle. My thoughts after leaving the theatre that night, was that the original ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) continues to hold up extremely well (Even in the effects department thanks to Stan Winston), and I was surprised at how much I did enjoy ""World"" even with its many, many flaws (The movie just had the highest grossing opening weekend of all time with over half a billion dollars, Bravo!).So in what is possibly one of the worst cut and paste scripts ever made, two brothers are sent to the fictional Isla Nublar to enjoy ""Jurassic World"", a Dinosaur theme park built upon the disastrous grounds of the first movie (A rather clever reference is made). They are there to visit their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park's operations manager who is obviously far too busy to see them and must prioritise on the large, new and exciting ""Frankensaurus"" they have created as (Here we go again) ""People have lost interest in Dinosaurs"". The inevitable happens, the electric stays on unlike the original movie and somehow the situation is made worse when there really should be some failsafe protocol given the tech this movie has. Aid is needed by the likes of Owen (Chris Pratt), who has somehow managed to command some form of alpha-male bond with the Dino's. Throw in a ruthless, corrupt head of security (Vincent D'Onofrio), too many clichés that throw back to the first movie (Which was sad when I thought the movie was actually doing well as its own thing), and some of the most blatant brand advertising I've ever seen. Ladies and Gentleman, welcome back to the park where brand loyalty IS priority.I don't really think there is anything here that will allow this movie to age as gracefully as its origins, and not one character is well developed enough to the point where their performance stood out. There were moments where so many subplots were left unanswered, and the dialogue wasn't particularly rich with sentences that gave a deeper thought of ""Man playing with nature"" (Though let's be honest, none of the movies really have). A hilarious moment I had to myself was when comments are made about using Raptors in War (An image of one came up suited and booted for combat on screen), to which I thought of the ""Helicopter scene"" from ""Apocalypse now (1979). Instead of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"", send a bunch of Dino's into Warzones with John Williams's ""Jurassic Park"" score (""Jurassic War"", that'll be the day).But in all honesty, there were some moments that did win me over. I like that most of the casting decisions were spot on, and though I was expecting some terrible CGI we actually got some really good moments and set pieces that helped made me appreciate the efforts the filmmakers went to. The film wastes no time getting into the heart of what made the series so appealing to begin with, and I also thought a certain aquatic dinosaur should've really been the ""big top"" of the show. When all is said and done, I came out of it satisfied when I was almost certain I was going to downright hate it.Final Verdict: Dumb fun. I've given my two cents, and I hope you enjoyed them. The movies a huge financial success, and there was plenty enough that would make me look forward to a next instalment as much as consistently dread it. Obviously I feel I have referenced the previous movies far too much, and for that I apologise. But in the end, Dinosaurs are popular again. Touché movie, touché. 6/10.",Jurassic World

To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to get eaten. I watched it in 3D, and I'm selective about the films I watch in 3D these days, but I have to say I was pretty darn good.

258,renegadeviking-271-528568,Jurassic World review,7,6 January 2020,"Finally, a decent sequel to Jurassic Park. It only took 22 years. Life finds a way, I suppose.Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow and takes place 22 years after the original film, almost entirely ignoring the events of The Lost World and Jurassic Park III. This new film sees John Hammond's original vision come to life: a theme park filled with living, breathing dinosaurs has finally been made operational and open to the public. However, the general population has since grown used to seeing real dinosaurs, for whatever reason, and in order to combat diminishing returns and prevent their park from going under, bioengineers create a new hybrid dinosaur, dubbed Indominus Rex. Indominus is smarter and more cunning than they originally thought, and soon, it escapes from its confines and wreaks havoc on the entire park in typical Jurassic Park fashion.If you read my Classic Review on the original Jurassic Park film, you'll know that it was and still is a huge part of my life. I first saw it when I was very young, and it has stuck with me ever since. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and in my humble opinion, it's nothing short of a masterpiece. While I absolutely love that film, though, I can't exactly say the same for either of the sequels. The Lost World is boring, with bland action and equally bland characters, and Jurassic Park III is just plain silly. With that in mind, I wasn't really anticipating Jurassic World all that much. There hasn't been a single good entry into the franchise since the first film, and the trailers failed to hook me. However, I couldn't stop myself from seeing it - I love the original film too much, and I'm always willing to see anything Chris Pratt is in nowadays. The end result? Not too bad.I enjoyed a lot of what Jurassic World had to offer. It's good, but isn't great. One of the best aspects of the film, without a doubt, is Chris Pratt's presence. His character, Owen Grady, is a former member of the United States Navy and has since been hired to work at Jurassic World as a velociraptor trainer. Pratt is primarily known for his comedic chops thanks for his background in Parks & Rec and last year's smash hit Guardians of the Galaxy, and I was surprised to find that they chose not to utilize Pratt for the film's comedic relief, instead turning him into a badass action hero, a choice that worked out really well. He was completely convincing in his action sequences, and I was able to take his character seriously. His relationship that he shared with his team of four raptors was perhaps the most believable relationship in the entire movie, however, which is where my first problem lies.One of the reasons why Jurassic Park is so great is because of its characters and how they are written. Each of them are unique in their own way, and they each serve a purpose for the story. I can't say the same for Jurassic World. This is a film that's been stuck in development hell for over ten years, with several different screenwriters in the midst of legal debacles trying to decide who should get writing credits for the film, and this really shows. The film's script is incredibly unfocused. There are storylines with certain characters, particularly one that follows the two main kids and their parents, that is brought up in the first act of the film and is completely abandoned halfway through. Their parents had served no purpose towards developing the film's story, and therefore had no reason to be included whatsoever, except to get their kids onto the island so they could eventually be chased by dinosaurs. Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays the film's main antagonist, is perhaps the worst of all in terms of how he is written. Not only are his motives nonsensical, but his characterization is very cliched. D'Onofrio is an otherwise talented actor, and he was wasted here. Bryce Dallas Howard was good in her role, but her character was also quite cliched - the uptight businesswoman who has to ensure that everything is running smoothly. In the end, Pratt's Owen Grady was the only one that I was able to invest in.While it might seem as though I hated the film at this point, I didn't. There was actually quite a bit that enjoyed, particularly the dinosaur action. The Indominus Rex was, for lack of a better term, just plain awesome. Her capabilities made her a formidable opponent for Pratt and his crew, and her design was unique. Any scene involving this thing were the most exciting and intense of the entire film.Without spoiling anything, there was one scene in particular during the third act involving a certain dinosaur that had me grinning ear to ear, and made me feel like a kid again. It was one of the few moments in the film where I felt as though I was actually watching a Jurassic Park movie.I also loved Michael Giacchino's score, and how well it blended with John Williams' original themes. While the film didn't capture the awe and grandeur that a Jurassic Park movie should have, the score certainly did.The Verdict: Jurassic World isn't a good Jurassic Park movie, but it's a good monster movie. While the original film treated its dinosaurs as wonders of nature, this one treated them as killing machines. If this film didn't bear the word Jurassic in the title, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but because Jurassic Park is such a big part of my life, it's only fair for me to compare this sequel to its predecessor. I can safely say, though, that this is by far the best of the three sequels. Beyond its cliched character archetypes and sloppy writing, I was able to find enjoyment in this film. If you're at all curious to see how this one turned out, check it out during a matinee. While it certainly doesn't recapture the magic of the first time we were taken back to the land that time forgot, it succeeds in providing some great thrills.",Jurassic World
259,troyputland,Reinvigurated Entertainment,8,20 June 2015,"Dinosaurs are making a comeback, and there isn't a better time for it. 14 years have passed since the disappointing JPIII, so expectations are mixed. Has all been forgiven and forgiven, or will Universal's biggest franchise crumble? Thankfully the first route's taken, with a movie that's bold, clever and fresh. Jurassic World pays tribute to the original, sending waves of sentimentality and nostalgia down our spines. It also manages to be widely entertaining, accommodating new concepts that will satisfy fans old and new. Jurassic World smashes our way of thinking into the dust. A theme park is (actually) open. Park goers have declined in the last 10 years (believe it or not) and velociraptors are being trained to obey by an ex-navy marine. There are two main protagonists; one crunches numbers, relying on excellent statistics to keep the park up and running (Dallas Bryce Howard), the other believes in the natural order of things (Chris Pratt). Both portray contradictory feelings towards the park's new creation, the Indominus-Rex. Howard believes genetic mutation is the step forward to success, whilst Pratt sees this creature as an undefined project. A political stance is at the foreground of this movie, as well as a dino-disaster, a subtle romance, an all-out actioner and a rescue mission to boot. All sub-plots file in nicely with the bigger picture, and flow in nicely with what else is in store for the franchise. This is a big blockbuster movie.

The scene with the injured Triceratops in the original is now an injured Brachiosaurus. It's great that this is a remake and a sequel at the same time. The nostalgia factor is there for those who saw the original when it first came out, while at the same time keeping it fresh for a new generation. Chris Pratt doesn't disappoint with his special brand of sarcastic humor. His performance as dinosaur wrangler Owen is great. I said in my Iron Man 3 review that I hope the kid who played Harley does more acting in the future. He is in this, and he is as funny in this as he was in Iron Man 3. Some critics have complained that the story focused too much on the humans and not enough on the dinosaurs. I disagree. There was just enough teasing the dinosaurs to keep me interested even when they weren't on screen. A footprint here, a claw there, but never actually a full dinosaur until much later. And I won't spoil the finale, but its easily the best thing this franchise has ever done.

261,monstermayhem32,The return of the Dinosaurs,8,20 June 2015,"It has been 14 years since Jurassic Park 3 opened in theaters back in 2001 and now the next chapter of the Jurassic Park saga begins. 22 years after the incident at the Original Jurassic Park site, John Hammond's vision of having a fully functional theme park has finally come true for a newer generation to explore the history of dinosaurs. While it is disappointing that none of the main original characters from the previous films don't return except for Bd Wong as Henry Wu who who was a minor character in the original film but expanded upon in this one. This time around the story introduces a new set of characters which deals with the story of brothers Zach and Gray who are visiting their aunt Claire who seems more invested in her work than spending time with her nephews. However all hell breaks loose, when a genetically modified dinosaurs called the Indignious Rex who is a combination of other modified animals and looking like a more terrifying version of the T Rex. With the help of raptor trainer Owen, Zach, Gray, and Claire fight for survival. What I loved about the film was how it showed the strong bond that Zach and Gray had despite their differences. I really hope there is a fifth film in the series.",Jurassic World
262,rollernerd,Riding with the raptors through the jungle - awesome,8,13 January 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the sci-fi action adventure flick Jurassic World (2015) the sequel or should I say, soft reboot of the Jurassic Park series. We find ourselves in a world where after twenty so years we now have an active park open for business in Isla Nublar. That's right, after the disaster of the original park, the island also known as Jurassic World, is open to the public. Won't people ever learn? So now we have dinosaurs and people, like a zoo however in the background we have scientists and greedy people who are continuously exploiting the study of genetics. Due to the executives needing to gain more market share and more money, they need more impressions which means, more teeth. The scientists on the park genetically engineer a new breed of dinosaur, the Indominus Rex and what happens when a monster is created from the science lab escapes from its cage? It prowls around onto the park with a knack to hunt and kill...so yeh everything goes horribly wrong!This new world still touches on the original series, which can be highlighted by the control guy wearing the original Jurassic Park shirt proudly. The new flick has awesome new characters - one in particular played by the always cool Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, an ex-military who trains a group of raptors since they were hatched. He plays out the alpha to the raptors. Grady's character understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not science tests. Pratt's performance is awesome here, the motor bike scene through the jungle among the raptors on the pursuit of the Indominus Rex was savage and gangster. His training of the raptors and his bond with one in particular, Blue is cool as. The co-stars including Bryce Dallas Howard playing as Claire has her own moments from a corporate marketing slave to yeppp we stuffed up and now its to save people I love and survive. One thing I do not get is what is with the heels????? To me I feel like the writers held her back, she did have a cool bit with the T-Rex, but again the heels?? As mentioned, there are throwbacks to the original including the mad scientist Dr. Henry Wu, the DNA cartoon which you see for a second or two, the analogy of birds and dinosaurs, how flares hype up a T-Rex and Hammond's ""spare no expense"" phrase.The director does justice in this film by ensuring there is a homage to the original films while making this new flick its own. There are other great parts including the Indominus Rex having camouflage like abilities, an unlikely prehistoric duo battling the Indominus Rex, which is really impressive and a great watch of the final battle. I also like how the T-Rex went through the Spinosaurus skeleton as a nod to the third flick 😉 A few nods include the pterosaurs flying around the resort and the death of an unlucky assistant who gets devoured by the park's whale like attraction, the Mosasaurus. Unlike its original predecessor there is no animatronics, so the film is heavy on the CGI. If you like action and adventure and how man and dinosaur can fight side by side, then watch this film - overall 8.2/10",Jurassic World
263,projectsgamer,Big Surprise,8,10 May 2021,Jurassic World is a big surprise to me I really like this Movie the First Act in this movie is boring but then it picks up Another thing is the kids are not the best I really wish they were better like the first Jurassic Park because they were very boring they are trying to set up a backstory which they did nothing about Claire Was kinda annoying in this first act also The first act almost gets me out the movie but than it picks up also Chris Patt is amazing if he wasn't in this movie would have failed guaranteed what he brings to the character is phenomenal also the raptors have emotional moments which is weird but with Chris patt and those raptors they have a connection which was nice I give Jurassic World An B.,Jurassic World
264,pkpera,"Started well, then got mediocre, ending was just remake",6,11 July 2015,"When I saw that there are 4 scenario writers I was even in dilemma about watching it at all. That's always a bad sign, and means usually inconsistent, at times messy plot and other not good things. While I'm sucker for dinosaur movies. Later prevailed, so I went to watch it. It was better than expected in first 30 minutes. Not that whole family picture and departure was even close to something original, but was decent, and idea and explanation of need for creating new, more spectacular dinos because ""classic"" ones became boring is actually pretty realistic description of today situation in entertainment industry.Idea about training raptors is a bit of extreme, but don't forget that raptors were shown in Crichton's book (where all this started) as super intelligent, fast, cooperative specie. At least in movie they gave more realistic top speed for them than in book (80 instead 100 km/h) . Talking about 2 leg ones, just to add. But here ends short list in what this could be better than book, or first two Jurassic movies. Character development is just poor, 2 main character relation development was what made me laugh couple times - kiss in first place, then wise words at end :-) a CGI was not bad, but could be better in 2015. For a World, there should be really more dino species shown.Now the bad, and very bad part(s): lot of it was just replica of first Jurassic movie, and little from second: the kids on Islar, stupid park (Island/World) control ... Ending should be some climax, but it was just lame. There was no sense in that attacking of I-Rex by raptors after what happened before. And all it was in first movie, almost same. I hope that everyone saw it, so this is not spoiler. It seems, that writers went out of ideas completely at end. Military subplot was also pretty lame, and really unrealistic - not that I think about them as some very smart people, but this was way too low.Rating is still 6 after all bad words about, because good start, some good (for pure fun) scenes, like attacking by pterodactyls. Good for warm summer afternoon/evening. Only in theaters with air-condition :-)",Jurassic World
265,ExpendableMan,"Hey man, I only work here!",7,19 July 2015,"'Jurassic World' is one of those movies which is a lot more enjoyable if you don't think about it too much. If you convince yourself to ignore the plot holes, the woman who sprints in high heels and the complete absence of Jeff Goldblum, it's loads of fun. It's two hours of popcorn munching spectacle, full of Dinosaurs ripping people apart and pulse pounding set pieces. It's not as good as the original, but it surpasses both 'Lost World' and 'Jurassic Park III' to stand as the superior JP sequel. You'll be riveted to the screen constantly and it'll only be a day or two later that you realise how many cracks there are.Set twenty years on from the original, 'Jurassic World' sees John Hammond's dream as a reality. The park is now fully functional and incredibly successful, with attractions ranging from gyroscopic tours through fields of herbivores to the childish joy of riding a baby Triceratops. According to the people in charge however, this isn't enough and the growing public apathy towards the scientific marvel of 'de- extinction' has seen attendance figures drop. In an effort to keep the crowds flocking in, Dr Henry Wu and his boffins have created an entirely new species - the Indominus Rex. This all new reptilian monster is a mass of teeth and claws that has been bred for the specific purpose of being a total nightmare. Wonder if that'll get out? Surprise, it does! From the initial security guard-shredding breakout, 'Jurassic World' plonks an escalating series of action scenes on top of each other as the Indominus goes on the war path. In true sequel style, the fights are bigger, the body-count higher and while there's nothing to match the tension masterclass of the original's Raptors in the kitchen scene, it's still eye-popping escapism of the highest order. Thought the Rex fighting the Spinosaurus in 'Jurassic Park 3' was cool? You ain't seen nothing yet. Where it falls down though is the characters. Sure, Chris Pratt is effortlessly engaging and Irrfan Khan's upbeat billionaire is a worthy successor to John Hammond, but it's obvious that this script has been written and re-written too many times for anyone else to remain consistent. Bryce Dallas Howard has a good stab as the ice- queen turned worried aunt, but that doesn't explain why she would interrupt a frantic search for her nephews to coo over a dying Brachiosaur. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson meanwhile are likable enough as the kids in peril, but Vincent D'onofrio's military nut has blatantly had a few scenes cut to speed up the running time. It's not the fault of the actors but the numerous alterations to the story during the years in development has left them behaving irrationally, while one plot strand especially has a ""oh, just throw a Raptor at it"" feel to it. Plus, the solution to the Indominus Rex problem isn't really a solution at all and it'll be clear to anyone that spends more than ten seconds thinking it over that they've solved nothing. When it comes to pure spectacle though, 'Jurassic World' is going to be a tough one to beat in 2015. The new 'Star Wars' has a fight on its hands if it hopes to beat the Pterosaur swarm, the Mosasaurus leaping from the water and the Raptors taking on the army. In terms of pure visual appeal, this can go toe-to-toe with the likes of 'Pacific Rim' any day and despite the weak script, there's more delights to be had here than in four 'Transformers' movies. Definitely needs more Goldblum though.",Jurassic World
266,themadmovieman,A pretty solid sequel in a struggling franchise,7,12 June 2015,"This is the first pretty solid sequel in this franchise. Of course, it doesn't stand up to the original, because there are still some flaws with character development, pacing and visuals, but on the whole this is a really fun and exciting movie with a good script and thrilling action sequences.Let's start with one of the biggest successes of this film, its atmosphere. Whilst The Lost World and Jurassic Park III treated Isla Nublar like a haunted house, this film restores some of the wonderment and awe that you felt at the beginning of the first movie, seeing it once again as a park where dinosaurs roam, making this a much more exciting film to witness at first, and leaving its transition into disaster all the more shocking than the previous two films.One of the most interesting things about this is also the fact that it's set in the functioning theme park, Jurassic World, that we all wanted to see since the original. It makes an interesting note on scientific experimenting and capitalism, something not done since the original, whilst the fact that the island is full of helpless tourists makes the threat of the dinosaurs all the more scary.And strangely, this is quite a scary film. Of course, it's nothing to give you nightmares, but the thing that really stands out from this whole movie is the excellent action sequences that are both exciting and destructive, but also tense and patient, much like the classic sequence in the car in the original Jurassic Park.Although the story takes a little bit of a while to get going and should definitely have been cut down, once everything begins to kick off, this turns into a properly exciting film, and it's that stunningly powerful tension in pockets throughout that makes it so, leaving you squirming in your seat as you fear the terrifying Indominus Rex.Let's talk about the dinosaurs, because they are, after all, the reason you want to watch this film. The CGI is fantastic, although I still don't think it's as exciting to look at as the practical effects in the original, but still, they do a great job of giving this dinosaurs a really strong presence on screen, and that main antagonist, the Indominus Rex, is really striking to watch.Finally, the characters are the only disappointing part of this movie. Whilst Chris Pratt does a fantastic job, as well as some of his co-stars, none of the characters are particularly interesting or appealing like some of those in the original, and it's that that decreases the fear factor to some degree.Overall, though, I'm giving this a 7, because it's a properly exciting action movie with patient teasing and powerful tension throughout, and despite some character issues, it's got a strong, intriguing premise that will make for a lot of fun for the duration.",Jurassic World
267,michaelradny,Jurassic Park IV: Better Than The Third,6,28 July 2015,"It's not really the nostalgia trip I was expecting, but more like a revamped, better version of the third installment of the series. It succeeds at some things that I thought it would fail at, but it also fails in area that are obvious for failure. But the good, it was more graphic and unexpected than I thought. The dino fights were ecstatic and the thrill of the film was right up there. Where it fails, is the complete stupidity of the characters. However, knowing this going in makes the film a little more tolerable and less frustrating. A good film. Not like the original, but an exciting film. Would be better as a non-Jurrasic Park film, but we have it know and should take it as it is.",Jurassic World
268,jb_campo,Satisfying but Same Old Same Old - just different cast,7,12 December 2015,"I went into this film not expecting anything new, and my expectations were met. The film depicts the Isla Nubar 30 years or so after the original Jurassic Park fiasco. The difference is that Jurassic World is bigger, hugely popular, with many more genetically-mixed dinosaurs.The cast stars some young actors as the kids, not sure who they are - their acting extended as far as being scared. But Bryce Dallas Howard (Girl in the Water; The Village) was outstanding as Claire, the aunt who runs Jurassic World, and has thrust upon her these two nephews for whom she has no time - busy working single lady. Of course, enter Chris Pratt as Owen, semi-mysterious Dinosaur trainer with special skills to direct the Raptors (you remember them from the original). The movie was worth watching just to see these two interact with each other. They were the stars.The other major stars are the dinosaurs, or the CGI people who did a fantastic job putting all these dinosaurs into almost every scene. Tremendously life-like depictions really are the star of the show.I hope/trust you are not going to this movie for the story line. Shocker - something big gets out - things go wrong - people get stomped on and killed. Can't someone save the day?Of course, because Bryce is already signed up for a sequel. Although you know the story, and it's pretty much a repeat of the original series, the two main stars pull off a tough job and keeping you on your seat with some innovative chase scenes I have not seen before.All told, a satisfying story, kind of like putting on those well worn shoes you have, which feel so comfortable and familiar.

270,luke-a-mcgowan,Trevorrow alternates between beating you over the head with his paper thin characters and making an sickly imitation of classic scenes and story lines,2,15 September 2015,"This movie stinks.Here's the positives - I'm getting them out of the way because this review is going to tear shreds off this movie. It looks nice - the way that the KFC Dirty Double looks nice. There's nice cinematography - really nice at times. A couple of nice lines - ""monster is a relative term"" was probably my favourite. Jimmy Fallon has a funny cameo. Sound like I'm nitpicking for positives? I am. This movie STINKS!Jurassic Park is one of the most profound cinematic experiences in the world. It is soaring, majestic and thoughtful. The Lost World is also terrific - not quite the original, but Jurassic World doesn't even lick the sequels boots, let alone the original. Lets start with reason number one. The first two were made my Steven Spielberg, one of the best directors who has ever lived, period. He knew how to balance deep characters with huge spectacle - he'd been doing it for almost 20 years. Whose this Colin Trevorrow dude? He's directed four things, including a TV Movie, a short film, and a documentary. But hey, I'm not one to be prejudiced against rookie directors - some are naturals, like Ben Affleck or Joel Edgerton. Unfortunately, Trevorrow's style is completely imitative. The whole film feels like a cheap knockoff of Spielberg's classic, kind of like when you open a pack of fake Pokemon cards. It looks real - to an idiot - but you know its not and you stand there feeling crestfallen and disappointed. All through the film you'll see shots from the original and think ""oh, you're recycling that shot again. Nice, very original sir."" I swear, after the sixth or so time they did that close up of the side of the Rex's face, I was yawning at a moment that can give me chills in the original. The more intimate moments also feel botched - such as an overly dramatic first scene in which Zach and Gray's parents bid them goodbye, which gives the feeling that the kids are being sent off to the country during a war, not going on a week long holiday! Trevorrow has no idea what to do with Jurassic Park's glorious score, teasing it constantly but only giving us a big taste once - during a non-reveal of buildings. You know when Spielberg used that swell? During the banner fall at the end of Jurassic Park. Now that was good. Boy can you tell the screenplay was written by committee, as opposed to a brilliant novelist. One moment Pratt is hissing at Howard, the next he's flirting with her. The characters are always changing - Irrfan Khan's Dr. Masrani, introduced in his first scene to be John Hammond's natural successor - asking about the dinosaurs welfare and the customers having fun whilst gently admonishing Claire for being uptight and delighting in flying his helicopter. Just two scenes later, he is established as a money-grabbing businessman, far more in sync with Peter Ludlow from The Lost World. I never bought the film's premise for a moment - people sick of dinosaurs? But they're no different to elephants, says someone. Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but zoos aren't exactly out of business for lack of interest. Meanwhile there's Pokemon Master Chris Pratt and his loyal band of velociraptors (Pratt has nothing close to a character arc in this film) and some kids (a shameless attempt to replicate Tim and Lex) have a thrown together storyline that I barely followed or paid attention to. There's a single scene where Gray reveals their parents are getting divorced with absolutely no context, and is never mentioned again. Zach is a brooding hunk whose character arc is followed so explicitly he might as well have turning signals as he moves along.I saw the original Jurassic Park (and the Lost World) over a year ago, and I can name every character from Alan Grant to Denis Nedry. I saw Jurassic World about twenty minutes ago and I've forgotten nearly every name already. Chris Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio and Bryce Dallas Howard have almost nothing to work with, stuck with paper thin characters that you can see clean through on a mildly sunny day. But don't worry, Trevorrow will beat you over the head with it anyway - Pratt is introduced in a glowing halo of light to tell us that he's our protagonist whilst Howard robotically recites park statistics to her boss so that we know she's a cold businesswoman. I found her performance disappointing too - during a scene where its a near foregone conclusion that her nephews were eaten, she reacts just a little less emotionally than you would if your dog ran away. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are utterly unbearable, screen time spent on Robinson sniffling and Simpkins staring dumbly at pretty girls. Jake Johnson got raves for being funny, but I found him to be pathetic whose character arc ends in a romantic rejection. Nice.There's a lot more wrong, but I'll wrap up my rant by talking visuals and action. In 1993 Spielberg blew our minds. In 2015, I swear we've gone backwards. Its nice to look at, but its not real. Spielberg set the bar and Trevorrow swatted futilely at it as he soared somewhere beneath it. There's a couple of cool action throwdowns and even a pitched battle, but they are all disappointingly short.Long and the short of it - don't watch this. I'm going to rewatch the original to cleanse my pallet.P.S. I knew about the stupid heels going in. But what I didn't know was that Owen himself mentions it BEFORE all the chases began! WTF?",Jurassic World
271,teddyryan,Pretty Dazzling - one small annoyance,7,2 November 2015,"The Jurassic Park/World legacy is a staple of modern fiction. Michael Crichton's exploration of dinosaurs resurrected - the unveiling of man versus our most revered beast – is cinematic gold. Steven Spielberg did a masterful job with the original installment, Jurassic Park. This type of story was made for the master of adventure, wonderment, and spine tingling thrills. Steven stumbled on the sequel, hampered by a hokey script – but still delivered more creepy little foes from the prehistoric. The third lacks any compelling characters and is largely forgettable – although the unveiling of the Pterodactyl.JURASSIC WORLD is the fourth installment from Crichton's classic legacy.* JURRASIC WORLD is a homage to the original film sprinkled with a delicious dabble of current culture and technology. If you don't know the premise, the original Jurassic Park has now become a fully functional island resort run by a corporate conglomerate. Over 20 years later, it is now called Jurassic World. As opposed to the three previous stories, the island is filled with tourists and multiple attractions.Dig in. JURRASIC WORLD employs the classic plot points from Jurassic Park and a myriad of timeless horror movies – such as Aliens and The Birds. It's a tasty dish.The hero played by Chris Pratt is a young Indiana Jones – an adventurer living in the wild – adorned with the classic brown vest (although minus the hat). Bryce Dallas Howard is a high powered corporate employee that runs operations of the island. The Howard/Pratt relationship - the clichéd rugged hero matched with the high strung upper class beauty – works surprisingly well. Howard breathes life into the role of heroine. She avoids many dialogue/screenplay/character traps that could've nabbed another actress.The new director manages to hold the pressure and weight of the Jurassic universe. I give this guy props. Outside of yelling action on the set, I can't imagine the grace it would take to deal with the studio, multiple writers, and master of cinema, Spielberg himself. This newcomer has what it takes and the studio is reaping the benefits - he re-lit a giant franchise! It's the third highest grossing film of all time, I believe.SPOILERS *Any adventure movie requires suspension of disbelief. Spielberg has been aware of this since day one and carefully tows the line of fictional reality and fictional unreality.Unfortunately, The Jurassic World director screwed up an obvious detail – and it drove me crazy.Would any human being survive the rampage wearing a pair of high heels? Bryce Dallas Howard drops her fancy clothes, gets dirty, and dawns a Ripley tank top – yet does not remove her high heels throughout the movie!! This means she's sprinting from dinosaurs, explosions, and near death instances in a pair of high heels. This ridiculous problem could have been remedied easily. One scene of her working out at the park's fancy athletic facilities and keeping a pair of sneakers close by – that she throws on before joining in the rescue mission.Honestly, take one look at a woman walking to work through Manhattan in heels and then try picturing her escaping a velociraptor. This one details bothered me enough to give Jurassic World a B minus as opposed to a B plus.",Jurassic World

The island of dinosaurs has continued thriving in a newer, bigger, better park called Jurassic World. The park's geneticists have made breakthroughs including gene-splicing and hybrid engineering. They've recently created a new attraction, a cross-bred carnivore called the Indominus Rex. However, the park's owners have been experiencing problems with the new dinosaur and it's paddock. One thing leads to another, and before you know it, the I-Rex escapes wreaking havoc on the tasty wildlife and people. In the lead is Chris Pratt as former-Navy turned game warden. He's completely awesome and shows that real men still wear mustaches! Beside him for most of the film is Clare (Bryce Dallas Howard) picking up the reigns from where John Hammond left off. Clare's two nephews Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) also happen to be in the park when the rampage begins. The series has always had good solid acting, even if the characters in 2 and 3 were (annoying, paper thin, crunchable, etc.) This time around, the filmmakers wisely avoided having any of those types.So now, everyone's on a race to stop the I-Rex, save the visitors, and rescue Jurassic World from permanent foreclosure! As I already stated, this is a worthy sequel. From the writing to the cinematography to the music and characterizations, everything works beautifully.

If she had received her due comeuppance, I believe cheers of approval would have sounded in theaters worldwide. She is the bad guy in this movie, doused in a coat of thin-liquid heroine.Was the last 15/20minutes written by a ten year old? It can't of been written by anyone with any talent as it was talentless. Did a ten year old literally stand in a room full of executives and spout:""OK! Well! I want a big dinosaur to fight another big dinosaur with loads of little dinosaurs fighting each other & these little dinosaurs become friends with the humans who are fighting the biggest dinosaur that the big dinosaur is fighting and then the biggest dinosaur gets chomped on by a massive fish!"" - I honestly believe a script-meet must have happened like that.Once again, a potentially great film is let down by terrible writing.

277,darkreignn,Perfectly entertaining,7,27 February 2021,"I saw ""Jurassic World"" for the first time in 2021, as Cinemark theatres were showing some old favorites - having never seen this during its original theatrical run in 2015, I couldn't resist checking it out. ""Jurassic World,"" directed by Colin Trevorrow, is a perfectly entertaining thriller, serving as both a soft-reboot and sequel to the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy.From the moment the camera flies over the park, letting you bask in its sheer scale, ""Jurassic World"" has a great sense of fun and wonder. Dinosaurs perform crowd-pleasing tricks in various attractions, children ooh and aah as they feed miniature dinosaurs at a petting zoo, and crowds gather in utter disbelief at what they are witnessing; everything feels very magical, as it should - the calm before the storm, if you will. Starring Chris Pratt as Owen, ""Jurassic World"" also boasts a charismatic and badass star that's believable in his confidence around dinosaurs, and along with his chemistry alongside Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, the film has a strong sense of emotional resonance that is sure to keep you invested.One thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the slow burn approach it took before throwing you into the chaos - it let viewers feel comfortable and bask in the glory of the park before unleashing the dinosaurs on them. And if you're watching ""Jurassic World,"" you're likely wondering how the dinosaur action is - the answer is: very badass. There are multiple intense action sequences here, and the slow burn really enhances the thrill and makes the inevitable dread more effective. The CGI is genuinely impressive and immersive, and the entire film feels like a big roller-coaster, and it works. This isn't a movie that you go to for its Oscar-winning plot, but instead to kill two hours and have some fun, and it delivers.And speaking of the two hour runtime, my only complaint would be that the movie feels a touch too long. I feel like if 15 to 20 minutes were shaved off this film it would've been the perfect thriller, but the two hour length does slightly overstay its welcome. That said, I had a lot of fun in this movie, and never found myself bored, which is always a good sign. So, if you're a fan of the original ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, check this out!

279,rlaine,"Solid popcorn movie, altho way too violent",7,16 May 2016,"I was a feeling a bit old watching this movie, which isn't very common at all. The movie does a good job tho in bringing the franchise to next generation. The transition and references work quite well. I was pleased how solid and well directed the movie in whole was. In the very beginning it felt as if it might be awkward, but once it started, it worked quite well.Acting was pretty good. I don't watch many Hollywood movies anymore, so wasn't familiar with Chris Pratt, but he makes a good Indiana Jones style lead. Bryce Dallas Howard is a bit over the top at times, but her character works in a blockbustery clichéd way. The kids were OK, altho a bit underdeveloped.What I didn't like was the violence. In my opinion the movie is way too bloody and violent, even warlike. It's been a while since I last saw the original, but I kind of remember it being more on the scary side than action violence. I personally prefer a few tense scary scenes to full throttle violence. This movie does not have the same suspense factor - in my opinion - as the original with raptors. Then there is one quite prolonged death scene, which isn't too graphic, but you have time to feel the despair.I also felt that there were a bit too many different themes thrown in. There's a very under developed divorce theme, the military theme, the profit theme, the marketing theme, love story theme etc..Seeing this movie made me both slightly worried and also intrigued of how Trevorrow will direct his Star Wars IX. He seems like a capable director, able to handle a lot of stuff including surprisingly working jokes amidst action, but also seems to create a tad violent stuff.Not showing this to my kids yet, but pretty good movie otherwise.",Jurassic World

What I want to point out is that the contribution made from the original film to the industry is not there in this film. The excessive visual effects is quite the same ""trump"" card the new blockbuster films have always been playing without new innovative approaches for films. Comparatively ""Mad Max : Fury Road"" is one of the best films I have watched with both Blockbuster and Classic fusion. We'll talk about this later with the ""worthy"" films.Overall this film had so much potential and opportunity to make a blast in the industry but missed it. And kinda ruined a childhood favourite franchise.",Jurassic World
282,swedzin,Only worthy because of the end,6,25 May 2016,"A Few years ago I heard that the fourth JP movie is planning. I wasn't that much excited, because of all stories I heard about hybrid mutants and other stuff. However, I must say that I enjoyed it very much. This film brought a very exciting ending, and I think that's the reason why this film rocked so much at the box office. And I promise you I will explain to you in the spoilers section. I'll mark where the spoilers are. In 2001, ""Jurassic Park 3"" simply ruined the franchise, and really, it took 14 years to heal. Now, the plot is little bit ridiculous. Because some rumors about hybrid dinosaurs were true. The movie is set in 2015, and of course it shows today's typical society, people's faces and ears stapled to cell phones and tablets. Two parents are sending their kids to the Jurassic World. Gray and Zach. The characters of Zach and Gray did not leave that much of an impression, one is a Dino-nut, spewing all the dinosaur trivia and names, because audience is probably not that informed and Zach is just missing his girlfriend. These two tare thrown into a deadly situation, only to practice their screaming and to gives us that old cliché of youngsters in trouble.Then we have Owen Grady (Pratt), who works in the 'World' as a raptor tamer. How is that working? How can you tame an extremely primitive, overlarge lizard? He is also charming and horny, but I think that's Chris Pratt's persona and there are some of those charming, funny scraps of Starlord from ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"". Then, we have Clair (Howard). She is a park manager, and just somewhat a female version of John Hammond (wearing all that white). She is not a CEO, but merely a director of the operations of the park, because Hammond hasn't open his own park yet in the first film, and he was a CEO. Her character was pretty much strong, she was ready for action when it was required and she is pretty much married to her job. Her character brings out something that is just silly in the film. Now, she explains that the people are not excited by the ""Jurassic World"" anymore, I quote her ""No one is interested in dinosaurs anymore"" and ""Kids these days are looking at the Stegosaurus as an elephant in the zoo."" Are you kidding me? Are those kids so hard to please? Those are dinosaurs! Scientist brought back dinosaurs! And they are not intriguing and interesting anymore? Seriously? So, we are brought to our main antagonist of the film – Indominus Rex. What? You gave him ""Rex"" at the end? So, he is basically a new king in the block. This is our dinosaur hybrid made from DNA of other various animals. So it's basically a super dinosaur, who can, for example use camouflage. And is it just me, or that does Indominus looks like giant Velociraptor? Then we have park's CEO Masrani (Irrfan Khan) who is somewhat, larger than life comedy relief. And he is not funny. We have a human villain – Vic Hoskins (D'Onofrio) who is really irritating character. The character is badly written, you just don't know if he is some sleazy imp, or a hard ass, stupid guy who loves control over things. He just wasn't that interesting. Henry Wu (B D Wong) returns to us from the first film, as the leader of genetic research from InGen. And just to gives us explanation for Indominus Rex. So, he is an Indominus Spokesperson. Actors were pretty good. Pratt was basically a typecast because of his funny and charming persona. Khan was good. The kids were nothing special. Vincent D'Onofrio is easily the best actor in the film, but I think he was there for the money. BD Wong, Omar Sy, Jake Johnson (a spineless, funny park operator who wears an old Jurassic Park shirt. And that's one scene I didn't like in the film, because Clair asks him to remove his shirt, because people have died. Oh, really? Than I have to question this film, because, when your movie is named ""Jurassic World"" and has dinosaurs in it and it's rated PG-13, you don't expect unicorn ponies doing some uni porn. You expect dinosaurs eating people and that's basically director's , producers and writes way of saying ""Our film is better than the old ones""). Now, let's discuss CGI. It could have been better. I am not joking, it's just not that convincing. I think that CGI artist should have watch first film to see the excellence of the early CGI which was totally awesome. And there was just a tiny bit of audio animatronics in the film. It would be better if they had it more. Editing was good, pretty much intense. The Set design was pretty good. Exterior is appalling and thrilling. Camera work was solid, directing was not that , it was a good fun. When it comes to the script, why did it take a five people to wrote it? That just ruined the film. Sound and stunts were good. Music score was just a derivative from John Williams's brilliant score from the old films. The dinosaur design remained mostly the same and it's good.HERE COMES SPOILERSAs I promised, here's why I think that this film was great at the box office – because it brought back T Rex. And that's why I said, in the review title that this is the only thing the movie worth watching. T-Rex is back to have an awesome fight with Indominus. Now that was the only part of the movie when I was just thrilled and excited. I don't remember when was the last time I saw this kind of good old battle at the end of some new film. a classic monster film. Overall, this is one entertaining monster film and I recommend it. Have fun.",Jurassic World

285,fjhuerta-2,Yet more proof Steven Spielberg is a hack who should be kept away from a camera,5,28 June 2015,"Sure, the action scenes are fun. Let's get that out of the way, because that's pretty much everything that is right about this movie.Certain people did one or two things right. George Lucas, for example. Steven Spielberg is another. But every single piece of cinema he has done after, say, Jaws, or Indiana Jones, is simply terrible.Take this movie. Jurassic Park had a certain charm, but once you get past the couple of minutes of CGI, you notice how terrible the movie is. Bad acting, bad plot, terrible acting, ham-fisted approach to storytelling, horrible acting, you name it.All of this - and more - is in this movie. It's basically a remake of Jurassic Park - it's the exact same premise, with mostly the same characters. Can Spielberg think of anything else other than child geniuses? The story is laughable - you get this feeling that the characters need to do something, fast, and they stop and try to drive the story... slooooowly. The ham-fisted approach is there - characters won't only tell you what is going on, but what exactly is going to happen. The whole movie feels like a mega-million dollar school project.Once, I thought Spielberg was an amazing presence in the movie business. But that was 30 years ago. Right now, I can't imagine why people flock to watch his movies. Perhaps because the alternatives are even worse.Save your time, watch it on video. Better yet, avoid.",Jurassic World

287,daniewhite-1,Dinosaur Disaster,6,24 February 2020,"The best way to watch any Jurassic Park film in my opinion is not as a sci-fi, or fantasy or adventure film but as a disaster movie: like in any disaster movie we know what the source of the catastrophe will be and the entertainment is therefore twofold; firstly how exactly will things go from ""nought to sixty"" and what exact mayhem will be unleashed!!'Jurassic World' services both these requirements perfectly well and produces an overall satisfactory disaster movie for its troubles.Adequately acted by the child actors and passably so by a mainly unchallenged adult cast the direction and editing keep the pace cranking along after first taking time establishing who's faces we are going to see contorting in fear later and in tipping us the wink as to all the possible domino effects that might unleash the impending doom!I found the references to the 'first island', and by extension the original film, to be an entirely worthwhile angle for this ""soft rebooting""/belated 3rd sequel to use.The special effects and the depictions of carnage and chaos as dinosaurs fought and killed and ate people and fought and killed and ate each other were excitingly sillified.Sillified madhouse nonsense sums up a decent disaster movie experience.I rate a 6/10 and recommend accordingly if the viewer treats this movie within its appropriate genre; but as an aside the sequel sounds terrible, not a good disaster movie concept at all, and I haven't considered watching it as a result.",Jurassic World
288,Bruce722,Solid way to reinvigorate this franchise.,7,4 July 2015,"Jurassic World was a great way to reinvigorate this film franchise. The first two were incredible but the third film left a sour taste in most people's mouths so this movie had a lot on its plate. If it flopped it would've certainly been the end to this franchise for a long time until years down the road Hollywood gave it the inevitable remake treatment. However, if it succeeded in delivering a quality product that fans would enjoy, the sky was the limit. Well, lucky for us fans, it delivered a really good film. With regards to the cast, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do a great job as the male and female lead counterparts; Vincent D'Onofrio once again takes the role of the villain and he does so masterfully; Jake Johnson provides great comedic relief throughout the film (maybe too frequently to be honest); to be frank, the only weak part of the cast were the two child leads. In what has become an unfortunate cliché in this franchise, children were given too large of a role and they couldn't deliver the necessary emotions. The first film got lucky there... more often than not, banking a large portion of your film on the capabilities of child actors is a mistake. Thankfully this was not a movie entirely reliant on acting so it wasn't a grave error but trying to emulate the magic of the first definitely hurt the movie a bit. The film also failed to deliver quite the same edge-of-your-seat thriller experience that the first two did. A lot of that had to do with any sense of unknown being eliminated almost immediately. In the first movies, you rarely caught a glimpse of the ""villains"" (T-Rex or the Raptors) during the build-up of the suspense. This helped create a certain tension that really captured you. This movie doesn't manage to do that at all. Instead, Jurassic World is an action movie that has dinosaurs, humor, and solid acting. Essentially it felt like a 21st century superhero movie but instead of Iron-Man or Captain America it had Velociraptors and an Indominus Rex. The problem is, it shouldn't be that type of movie at all. Nonetheless, the action, the nods to the original film (which was probably my favorite part of the movie), and the dinosaurs devouring people makes this worth the price of entry. Just don't go in expecting it to building on the originals.",Jurassic World
289,FairlyAnonymous,You can almost smell the plot burning away,4,13 June 2015,"This was a miserable movie to sit through. I understand movies that are special effects driven, I mean, at least you can enjoy the effects. However, this movie is just... my goodness... it is just bad. When the most engaging characters are the raptors, you know there is something wrong.The movie starts out well. It has a kind of cheesy feel, but everything works right. Kids go to Jurassic World while scientists are developing a new dinosaur, all while Chris Pratt is training velociraptors... seems like a fair enough premise. The concept of a genetically engineered dinosaur becoming sadistic and cruel is very interesting. T-rex was a natural predator, but the I- Rex is actually sadistic and knows what it is doing. This is interesting because there is now more reason to fear it.The red headed lady who runs the place, is incredibly dull and doesn't listen to reason. Chris Pratt explains if the I-rex isn't put down, it will kill more people. What does she do? She sends in more people with weak weapons to fight it and they die. So what does this mean? This means she has literally sent people to their death, even against the advice of others. She is essentially evil and soulless. There are multiple moments in the movie where she leads people to their death and Chris Pratt consistently explains why it is a bad idea.This is the movie in a whole and it makes it frustrating to watch. Everyone in the movie makes the worst possible decisions. You know the term called ""holding the idiot ball""? It means when a character instantly becomes dumb beyond reason just so that the plot can move along. Well, this movie is essentially dodge-ball... with ALL idiot balls.The movie starts off tense with a growing sense of dread. This was good, but now I shall get back to the moment where the movie instantly fell apart... this scene is so obvious that I can pin- point the exact moment...The Red-headed Aunt lady just thought her nephews were eaten, she has endangered the entire park, and she has lead dozens to their death, if not hundreds more... Chris Pratt is mad at her for being incompetent... and then... she tightens her clothes and begins to change her outfit like she is ready to hike... and she acts cute. She acts cute. She says she is now ready for an adventure and Chris Pratt smiles at her, but then treats her like a lady. That is the exact moment where the movie said: ""Screw the audience, screw the mood, screw Chris Pratt's character, this movie is now a joke.""I kid you not, the red-headed lady never learns her lesson and no one gets mad at her for screwing everything up. What makes the movie worse is that the movie is full of stupid elements left and right. There is this joke bad-guy character who is OBSESSED with using raptors for the military. No joke, every line of dialogue is him harassing people about raptors. This guy is so obsessed that he wants the park to get ravaged so that he can use the raptors to hunt down the I-rex. I kid you not, the movie becomes that dumb. And then, against all character, Chris Pratt allows the raptors to eat him... while Chris Pratt is holding a gun...Another good example is that there is a unit who needs to go into a helicopter to kill the I-rex. Who is the pilot? The one person in the movie who isn't qualified to fly a helicopter and has proved to be a bad pilot and even ONE OF THE CHARACTERS SAYS ""Are you sure you can fly that?"" I kid you not, within five minutes he crashes the helicopter and kills everyone on board. The movie is that dumb. The special-ops force that knows how to fly a helicopter allows someone with no experience fly it... and they all die from it. These are some notable examples, but this movie is a huge list of bad. It has stupid shifts in character, it has stupid plot-twists, and everything in it is so mind- numbingly awful that I am tempted to give it a lower rating. The one redeeming value of the movie is its production value. These are nice sets, these are nice looking dinosaurs, and the first part of the movie was good. That is it. There is nothing else in the movie worth watching.However, some of you may be saying this is all ""nit-picks"" and that the movie still works to some degree. Well, that is wrong. Regardless of the stupid shifts in character, lame plot-devices, and incredibly forced moments, the movie even fails at its main premise. The whole beginning premise of the movie is that the I-rex is terrifying because it is sadistic and cunning. The I-rex acts more like an escaped Hannibal Lector in the beginning of the movie... this is awesome. This is a good concept. Treating a dinosaur like the caged animal that it is. However, this element IS NEVER EXPLORED AFTER IT ESCAPES! The movie focuses more on forced romance and incredibly dumb character interaction. Why couldn't the movie make the I-rex more of the focus of terror? Yes, the I-rex uses a lot of jump-scares, but they are jump-scares that are almost identical to that of the other Jurassic Park. Another missed opportunity is the fact that it is hinted ever so slightly that the I-rex recognizes the red-headed lady. However, this is only used for a jump-scare and is never actually used to forward the plot. This could've been an awesome plot point where the I-rex constantly recognizes her.On a final note, the movie kills off this one woman character in a pointlessly cruel manner. Her death sequence that out for almost an ENTIRE MINUTE.",Jurassic World
290,mattiasflgrtll6,Should be called Mayhem & Destruction: The Movie,5,11 June 2015,"That's pretty much what this movie is about, after all: dinosaurs destroying s'hit. The story is very simple: a new gigantic theme park is opened, where people can view dinosaurs up close. All is well until a dinosaur seemingly escapes and things then get more and more out of control. Owen claims dinosaurs must be taken well care of, but Hoskins think they are useful as military weapons. We also have other characters: Gray and Zach, two brothers who are supposed to go with their aunt Claire (who can't since she's running the park). Dr. Henry Wo returns from the first Jurassic Park movie. Omar Sy plays a guy named Barry.Okay, I think that's about enough. The acting wasn't exactly at top. Chris Pratt, who was surprisingly good in Guardians Of The Galaxy, just felt out-of-place here. He doesn't convey emotions well and overall just seemed wooden. Bryce Dallas Howard was... not that good. Except for when she was screaming, she just delivered her lines the most awkward way possible and it sometimes even became really distracting. Ty Simpkins as Gray is pretty good. He was incredible in Insidious and is one of the few good actors in this movie. Nick Robinson as Zach is... all right. Nothing special. Vincent D'Onofrio was kinda bad, but I think that could have something to do with the stupid character and the stupid lines he was given. When I think about it, the only REALLY good actor in this was B.D. Wong. He did a bang-on job and is awesome in pretty much everything I've seen him in.The worst thing about this movie is the dialogue. The humor is hit-and-miss, sometimes it works sometimes it's just forced. But the cheesiness... Jesus Christ. If I were to count up all the clichéd lines in this movie, two hands wouldn't be enough for writing it down. It's all the s'hit you've heard a billion times and there is one moment particularly which bothered me: when Grey and Zach climbs up on land, lucky to be alive, Zach with a smiling face says to his brother ""You jumped!"" and the both of them are suddenly full of joy. In a situation like this, a line like ""Damn, we nearly lost our lives there!"" would have been far more appropriate since... let's face it. There was no guaranteeing they would've survived that fall. So when they still are in danger, what the hell is there to smile about? Cheesy bits like this just grind my gears. Even worse was the divorce line. Why would I give a crap if the kids' parents are getting divorced or not? It does not affect the movie in any way and felt like a very lazy way to make us connect with Grey.The CGI was actually decent. Nowhere near as impressive as the practical effects used in Spielberg's installments, but as good as it gets. Of course, it could have been improved in a couple of places. The actual Tyrannosaurus Rex itself could have needed some major improvement. I'll say this though: it's a whole lot better than the shi'tty CGI used for the orcs in the Hobbit movies. Have you seen how terrible they look there?The music was okay, but I wish John Williams had scored it.While this movie is mostly only meant to be a fun action ride, there's one major problem I just can't accept: the resolution. So let me get this straight: Owen seriously manages to instruct a dinosaur and other dinosaurs to attack Tyrannosaurus Rex. Hell, not only that, but one of them even nods at him! F'ucking bulls'hit. And worst of all, Tyrannosaurus Rex, the biggest f'ucking dinosaur ever, feels defeated by one little harmless dino kid waaaaaaay smaller than him. WHAT?! It even goes ""Fine, I give up! Stubborn, aren't you?"" and walks away. Not literally, but figuratively it does. I mean, what the f'uck? IT'S TYRANNOSAURUS REX, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! If anything, it should have been able to crush its f'ucking skull! I mean, the others are barely even suffering from any wounds, even though it's pretty much one of the deadliest creatures ever. Just ridiculous.Then, the movie ends with a dinosaur standing on a platform and roaring into the mid-air, 'cause... I don't know. They just couldn't think of a better ending.Overall, this movie only works as a mindless popcorn ride. You can just sit back and watch all the blurry action sequences (for once I just wish the camera could be focused enough so the audience can see what the hell is going on) and make fun of the laughable dialogue and visually idiotic sequences. Don't expect much and you won't feel like you just watched the worst movie of your life. However, that still doesn't excuse how boring of a movie this is. I'd advice you to not waste any cash on this flick unless you want to feel like time was well spent.Going to the actual theme park itself is probably more interesting ;)",Jurassic World

292,brianberta,This is better than the 2nd and 3rd movies but it still has problems.,4,15 June 2015,"The good news is that Jurassic World is a massive improvement from the 2nd and 3rd installments. Unfortunately, it's not perfect and it has a few problems.After scientists create a new dinosaur, it's shown to be intelligent and it escapes. Then the workers need to stop it before it kills the people on the island.What's good about this movie is that it seems slow at first but then surprises us and causes the action to pick up drastically. The action scenes look good and several scenes keep us on the edge of our seats the entire time. It doesn't have the same amount of tense moments that the original film had but it still delivers a fair amount of thrills.The effects are probably the best in the series so far. They are well done and they look realistic. There are a couple of scenes which look obviously cgi but not enough to distract the viewer from all the thrills.The film has mostly new characters. Chris Pratt's character showed promise but he gets overshadowed instantly when the carnage begins to happen. The film is mostly light on character development. I was at first going to ignore this but then I realized - what do we know about Pratt's character besides the fact that he works with the dinosaurs? Most if not all of the characters were so underdeveloped though that I could care less which ones lived and which ones died.There is a much higher body count then all the other films. But it lacks the showmanship and tension that Jurassic Park had. Also, while its script is slightly predictable, it does not overstay its welcome. The finale started off okay. It had its fair share of thrills but it was very predictable. It could've been seen coming from a mile away.This is a huge improvement over Jurassic Park 2 and 3. It's not perfect but it's showing promise that this once beloved series might come back.",Jurassic World

Johnson, Judy Greer, Vincent D'Onofrio, Nick Robinson, Lauren Lapkus, Omar SY, BD Wong, Irrfan Khan, Brian Tee, Ty Simpkins, Andy Buckley, and Katie McGrath Directed By: Colin Trevorrow Review The Park Is Now Open When it was first announced that they were making another Jurassic Park movie I was like why, and then I looked at the title and thought about it and said to myself ""this could be the best on the series."" But then I read reviews and see the first film which is a masterpiece, and I become very worried. Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. Claire played by Ron Howards hot daughter runs Jurassic World and gets her friend Owen(Chris Pratt) to check on the new attraction that scientists spliced to release it in Jurassic World. When this new dinosaur tricks them and gets Owen in the cage to try and eat and is let loose killing for sport. Claire and Owen's team hunt the dinosaur to take it down. My history with these Jurrasic Park films this week has been high and low. The only one my mother loves is the first one and she thinks Spielberg is a fantastic director while I think he's great but not amazing. I loved the first film, hated the second, and enjoyed the third, even though I saw it's flaws. This film is an action/adventure thrill-ride, so it's not like the amazing wonder of the first film. It's serviceable fun and a dang good sequel. Chris Pratt I was afraid was going to play Star-Lord again in this movie, but he didn't. He acted more like a general then anything to me. His acting was good and now Bryce Dallas Howard(who has stated wants to be Captain Marvel) is an actress who some say is terrible but me personally I like her and thought that this was best performance and film. I even noticed one star from the show New Girl in the movie and thought that was funny. The two kids who play Claire's Nephews do a good job as far child actors go and one of them is actually that kid from Iron Man 3. The special effects are pretty good but also a little funky in some scenes. It's actually sad when you think about it that our culture is not as mesmerized as we use to be by CGI because of how often we see it. But the direction from newcomer Colin Trevorrow is what helps this film along with the first films original director producing. Jurassic World is a great fun ride at the theater with some funky CG in some scenes but good acting, fun story, and great direction with a director and who were obviously passionate at making the best sequel to a 22 year old cult classic, I'm giving Jurassic World a four out of five.",Jurassic World

It is what it was supposed to be ... a great looking thrill ride with believable CGI dinosaurs making everyone nervous. :-)This was one of the rare films I've seen where the audience in my showing broke into applause as the credits rolled.So if you hated it, be smart enough to not go to the next one, and there IS going to be a next one. With a budget of 150 million and closing in on a half billion in domestic gross, there will be another one, and the producers, director, and actors you are all criticizing are laughing at you as their bank accounts go KA-CHING.",Jurassic World
296,Dragonsouls,"Great first half, but script fell apart",6,23 June 2015,"What a shame. This movie could have been so much better! I was completely enthralled during the first 45 min or so, and it was as if I was visiting the Park myself. The cinematography was beautiful, the attractions were innovative and the park was filled with so many extras, that it felt like a real place. There was a lot of interesting man vs. nature debate in the script as well as tidbits on the danger of technological progress. I applauded the writers at first. There were even some pretty decent character arcs but unfortunately, they never fully developed.When the action started to pick up, things went sour really fast. If this film had maintained its serious tone, I may have scored it in the 8's or even 9's. But sadly, the director chose to include bits of cheesy comedic lines in moments of urgency, completely ruining the thrill. I cared nothing for the characters, because, it seemed as if the characters took the threats they came across a bit too lightly for my tastes, so much so, that it completely nullified Bryce Dallas Howard's excellent performance. But hey, at least the action was better than expected and so was the CGI. I was skeptical at the fact that there were so few robotics used in this film, but it didn't matter. The CGI was that realistic. I still can't say it saved this film. I yawned a lot in the end, despite the pretty cool plot twist. This film should have been a horror film like the first 2 installments, but it chose to be a movie aimed at teens. What else is new these days with blockbuster films right? 6/10",Jurassic World
297,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Lots of Fun (but still cant hold a candle to the original),7,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World summed up in one word is FUN. Is it a perfect movie? No. Is it as good as the original? No. But its incredibly entertaining. The fight between the Indominus rex, T Rex and Raptor at the end was boss. Incredibly satisfying, and I don't think I've had that much fun watching a fight scene since the latest Godzilla. I also liked Jake Johnson in this. I thought he was genuinely funny and added in some much needed comic moments to help relieve some tension. I liked that his character didn't end up with someone romantically. I think thats what so many people expect out of movies these days and it was nice to see that take a different direction. (Although, that didn't stop the writers from making 2 other characters get together. But more on that later). And while I do miss the amazing practical effects, the CGI in this was still really good. I also liked that they did try and add some new elements to make it fresh. By having the park be fully operational. By training raptors. By having a new ""villain"" (aka the Indominus rex). Overall there were some fun moments and fun lines that made it quite enjoyable and probably the best sequel to the original. That all being said, sometimes I found it was playing too much of homage to the original. With having 2 siblings visit the park where a family member is in charge. And that particular family member dresses in all white. And at one point the kids get trapped in a vehicle as a dinosaur trys to eat them. And there are other little things sprinkled in, like Jake Johnson's character wears an original Jurassic Park t-shirt. There's a brief cameo of ""Dr.DNA"". The kids find an old Jurassic Park service station of some sort, where they find the night vision goggles of the first film and the jeeps. And then they even drive around in one of the jeeps. And I felt like they were really trying to play off our nostalgia when they should have been trying to make a more original film. Also, I didn't care as much for the kids as I did in the original. The younger kid (I seriously have forgotten their names) is very much another overly excited dinosaur know it all (like Tim was in the first). And as for the older brother, all we know about him is that he's girl crazy. Like he has a girlfriend back home, but he spends a lot of time in Jurassic World staring at girls. I also didn't particularly care for the romantic subplot between Claire and Owen (Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt). It wasn't the worst thing ever, but it was kind of contrived. But yeah, despite those things it was still a fun movie. Some really cool action sequences (I already mentioned the big fight at the end). I also thought the action sequence with the pterodactyls was awesome. I honestly got a little teary eyed when a brontosaurus died. The film was a roller-coaster ride and definitely a good summer flick.",Jurassic World
298,CleveMan66,"""Jurassic World"" brings the franchise into the 21st Century with big thrills and big fun.",8,12 June 2015,"Before reviewing ""Jurassic World"" (PG-13, 2:04), I think a few historical notes are in order. October 28th, 65,000,000 years B.C. (approx.) – dinosaurs become extinct, probably because of a massive comet or meteor striking the earth. 1990 A.D. – publishing company Alfred A. Knopf releases Michael Crichton's book ""Jurassic Park"", probably because of a desire to make money. 1993 – filmmaker Steven Spielberg directed, and motion picture studio Universal Pictures, released a film based on Crichton's book, probably for the same reason that Crichton's book was published. In the film, a venture capitalist named John Hammond is preparing to open an island theme park populated by creatures created from extinct dinosaur DNA. The project is abandoned when Hammond and his guests discover that the dinosaurs are too dangerous and unpredictable to be a theme park attraction. 1997 – all the key players behind the original ""Jurassic Park"" phenomenon are responsible for another book and film sequel called ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" in which it is discovered that there is a second island where surviving dinosaurs roam free. Results are similar to the original – dinosaurs eat people and lots of moviegoers pay money to see dinosaurs eat people. 2001 – A third film takes audiences back to the island from the second film. This film is not based on a Michael Crichton book or directed by Steven Spielberg. Moviegoers spend more money, but not as much as in the past. Then, no more people are eaten by dinosaurs for the next 14 years. 2015 – a fourth film in the series is released. Michael Crichton has since died and Steven Spielberg is only involved with the film as executive producer. Also in 2015 – the Movie Fan Community Facebook page publishes a review of the film. The review begins with a very long opening paragraph and then finally gets around to discussing the movie in question.""Jurassic World"" shows us that the late John Hammond's dream has become a reality. Built on the island of the original Jurassic Park, this new park is a combination of Disneyworld, Sea World, a safari park and a Jurassic Period ""Island of Dr. Moreau"". The coolly efficient park administrator is Claire Dearing (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, looking strangely like Jessica Chastain). Claire may run the place, but like everyone, she has a boss (Irrfan Khan) who wants to make money. Like a traditional amusement park building wilder roller coasters, or maybe a film franchise trying to manufacture bigger thrills, this park needs to periodically add new attractions to keep up consumer interest. Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) and his team of scientists are more than happy to fulfill that need by coming up with larger and meaner genetically-engineered dinosaurs. Meanwhile, a shady character named Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) has more than ticket sales in mind as he intently watches the park's head trainer, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), act as a kind-of dinosaur whisperer with some velociraptors.Soon, the new ""Indominus Rex"" (part T. Rex and part other stuff the lab rats aren't at liberty to discuss), the park's latest coming attraction, breaks free and starts coming to the other side of the island where the main park is located (along with its over 20,000 guests). This ""containment breach"" is very bad for business and occupies the efforts of all the main characters, including control room technicians played amusingly by Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus. Even as the park is starting to lose employees, the attentions of some of the key players are divided. Claire is supposed to be hosting her two visiting nephews (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins), but has simply given them V.I.P. passes and left them in the care of her assistant (Katie McGrath). The boys run off on their own, just as the park's ""assets"" are starting to run amok. As much as Owen cares for the dinosaurs he's training, he also seems to care for Claire as more than a park administrator. And as dangerous as loose, hungry dinosaurs can be, Hoskins views the growing mayhem with a combination of interest and greed as he tells someone on a cell phone call, ""we may have an opportunity here."" It looks like it's going to fall to Owen to save Claire's nephews from her neglect, save the park visitors from the marauding dinosaurs and save the park's power brokers from themselves. It's not exactly guarding a galaxy, but Pratt's character still has his hands full.""Jurassic World"" is everything a fan of the previous films would likely be hoping to see, and maybe more. The dinosaurs are bigger and badder and they look great (especially in 3-D)! The movie makes good use of the ""Jurassic Park"" story from the previous films, but branches out in some new directions. Except for a few random and slightly awkward moments, the script is smart – especially when it comes to the plot. It contains several different story lines that are woven together seamlessly. There's danger around every corner, but some subtle and well-placed humor relieves some of the tension and when the dinosaurs have a snack, the audience is spared an unnecessary amount of blood and gore. Some of the acting is less than stellar, but the leads do a very good job – especially Pratt who is perfect as the hero. This movie brings the franchise nicely into the 21st century and even elicited applause from some of my fellow moviegoers. ""A-""",Jurassic World
299,RichardSRussell-1,"The Kind of Spectacle That Imax, 3-D, and Dolby Stereo Were Invented For",8,13 June 2015,"Jurassic World (SF, biggie, sequel, 2:04, PG-13, Imax, 3-D) — 8Now THIS is what Imax, 3-D, and Dolby stereo were invented for — pure spectacle, voluminous in both senses, immersive without being overwhelming. And spectacle is what it delivers, with both barrels, all cylinders, and every flag flying. A worthy sequel to Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic Jurassic Park, this summer blockbuster likewise envisions a 22-year time gap, during which time the theme park on Isla Nublar has grown huge, attracting over 20,000 people at a time, deserving the new ""world"" label.There are plenty of resonances with the earlier film. Spielberg himself is executive producer, tho the directing has been turned over to Colin Trevorrow. Michael Giacchino, in charge of the music, has the eminent good sense to use a full-throated reprise of John Williams's magnificent theme at appropriate moments. We still get platoons of lightning- fast velociraptors, now rendered even more realistically. And B. D. Wong is back as ace geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. My only disappointment in the nostalgia department was the absence of a scene in corporate HQ with a large portrait of visionary John Hammond (the late Richard Attenborough) hanging at the front of the board room.But, for all its harkbacks to Park, this World truly achieves its goal of being ""bigger, louder, with more teeth"". There's nothing at all wrong with the action, adventure, or pacing.The one thing that prevents it from achieving 9-hood on my 9-point rating scale was that the human interactions were slightly off. Unlike Mad Max, here we are given 4 characters we can readily relate to: Chris Pratt as Owen Grady, ex-Navy, trainer of and surrogate father to 4 velociraptors; Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire, buttoned-up, all-business director of operations for the park; and Ty Simpkins as Gray and Nick Robinson as Zach, her 2 nephews, whom her sister naively expects will be getting the personal touch from their Aunt Claire. Unfortunately, these 4 relate to each other just a little too stiffly, with supposedly humanizing quirks more glued on than integral to their characters. Claire's slavish adherence to her stiletto heels, for example, just comes across as stupid, and their improbable cleanliness distracting. And the brothers' brief foray into the subject of their parents' possible divorce comes out of left field, lingers awkwardly like an unwashed guest, and then vanishes as pointlessly as it came. These aren't fatal flows, tho; the dialog isn't blatantly bad, just could've used more polishing.The example they should have aspired to is the cinema's all-time greatest sight gag, the exquisitely timed glimpse of the phrase ""Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear"" from the original. There's no equivalent here.The plot trigger is the escape from containment of the one and only specimen of a new species of dinosaur, the Indominus rex, created from a variety of predecessor species by means of genetic engineering, since the money guys behind the park evidently didn't think that regular dinosaurs were cool enuf all by themselves. (Totally wrong there; they are way cool!) Every time a new attraction has been introduced, we are informed, attendance has spiked. And they're overdue for another spike.An unexpected side effect is that Indominus (Latin for ""untamable"") isn't just big, hungry, and ferocious, it's also smart, cunning, ruthless, and equipped with a cuttlefish's camouflage genes. When Owen discovers that it's loose, he doesn't hesitate for a second: He advises hitting it with every lethal weapon available. Claire and her staff, of course, are reluctant to just blow away a scientific wonder, a unique creature that they've invested heavily in and are counting on for the park's future income. But, despite these differences, all concerned agree that they've got to work together to keep the monster away from the paying customers.About that word ""monster"". In one of the few reflective, philosophical moments of the film, one of the characters muses about whether it's appropriate to apply it to the big guy. ""To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat."" Um, yeah. Yeah, you may be right. But check out all the former canaries around here. Now let's hit that monster with everything we've got.In pursuit and attainment of a PG-13 rating, there's no gratuitous gore and violence here. People are obviously being slautered left and right, but very little of it occurs on screen, and only the occasional splash of blood on a wall or off-screen crunching sound gives any hint of the extent of the carnage.",Jurassic World
300,robsta23,All Over the Place,5,12 June 2015,"The four writers of Jurassic World didn't seem to be sure what they wanted their film to be - therein might lie the problem with collaborative writing. Collaborative writing is not always a problem - there were multiple writers on great films such as Toy Story and Children of Men, but after seeing the final cut of Jurassic World I wonder if the writers each wanted something different for the film to say.We start the film with two brothers who will be traveling to Jurassic World, the younger one more excited, the other one a young high-schooler more concerned about leaving his girlfriend even though he won't tell her he loves her when she says it to him. This older brother, Zach, is a pretty boring character who merely stares at girls at the theme park, but not necessarily in a creepy way since they smile at him. And his girlfriend is hardly ever brought up again; what a jerk. The younger one, Gray (I thought his name was Greg), is a dinosaur enthusiast who is constantly running to get to the next attraction in a hurry. Sending two kids to a dinosaur theme park seems like a bad idea - no matter how ""safe"" it is - but when they get there it is revealed they will have an adult chaperone, but they run away from her at one point, of course.So the movie suggests we will follow these two kids on their exciting journey, then introduces a handful of other ""main"" characters. There is the Chris Pratt character, who personifies animal activism in this film, ""Aunt Claire,"" who is a workaholic who works behind the scenes at Jurassic World, and does not have time for her two nephews - the boys mentioned earlier - and a security guy who is interested and obsessed with using Chris Pratt's raptors as weapons.If that wasn't enough, the main plot takes on a Godzilla-esque story (if Godzilla were a villain like in the '98 version) focusing on an alpha dinosaur who is virtually unstoppable, and escapes captivity through employing great intelligence and goes on a rampage across the park. You would think security would shut the park down immediately, but no - this is also a movie which questions the relationship between commercialism and safety, and the park's owner says security should be able to handle these types of problems without inducing fear in the park-goers.Without even getting into the second act of the film, this is already a mess, and if that wasn't enough, the film is filled with terribly cheesy comedic bits which feel extremely out of place for a sequel to a Spielberg classic. These moments feel more awkward than funny, and they drag the movie down with them.Jurassic World is mildly entertaining, but lacks the sense of wonder and awe present in the first film in my opinion, though it does contain some good moments of suspense. This is a decent popcorn movie, but its overload of various themes and subplots make it sloppy.",Jurassic World
301,blakiepeterson,Well-Made and Entertaining But Nothing New,6,19 June 2015,"Already fulfilling a world record as the highest-grossing opening weekend of all time, I suppose it doesn't matter to most people that Jurassic World doesn't cover any new ground, that it doesn't provide a very good case for yet another Jurassic Park sequel, that its thirst for money is crystal clear instead of worryingly unapparent. My complaints shouldn't suggest that it isn't an entertaining, enjoyable film; they should suggest that, despite a pining for more teeth and more thrills, you won't find yourself experiencing anything besides a popcorn ready case of déjà vu. But the action is visceral, the attitude adventuresome, the actors affectionate and enthused. Jurassic World doesn't have a lot of originality whirring around in its tiny little head, but it's just well-made and buoyant enough to provide for big-budgeted escapism worthy of one's precious time.The plot remains the same: dino-based amusement park seems sound at first glance, but goes haywire after its biggest exhibit knocks down its apparently impenetrable restrictions. This time around, the beast is not a sassy T-Rex but a selfish, genetically modified Indominus Rex, who is larger, more intelligent, and only content when killing for sport and terrorizing civilians. Our male lead is a wily Chris Pratt, his love interest a waspish Bryce Dallas Howard. I won't go into details regarding the characters — it's the same old, same old, all patrons relatable, all with baggage that does nothing besides add intrigue to the recycled plot.Movie consumer guide The Dissolve put it best when describing Jurassic World as being ""fun"" though ""ultimately more of the same in brand-new packaging"". It doesn't so much insult our intelligence as it does figure that bigger is better, that we won't notice that just because the I-Rex is larger doesn't mean some of the attack sequences won't feel vaguely familiar. Take a look at the scene, for instance, in which Howard's nephews, portrayed by Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, are trapped in a tour vehicle while the I-Rex roams the premises. Eventually (and expectedly), they are nearly killed, but escape in just the nick of time. But wasn't this exact moment caught on camera twenty-two years ago with Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as the young, would-be victims? Wasn't it just a little better, just a little bit more, I don't know, new? Whatever.Complaints abound. I could roast Jurassic World all day for making us go along with the fact that Bryce Dallas Howard spends the entire film in high heels, that Chris Pratt is able to ride a motorcycle sixty miles-per-hour through the jungle without running into any obstacles, that villain Vincent D'Onofrio somehow believes that one can actually weaponize dinosaurs to replace drones (???)(?)(????) (get out, you unnecessary side-character), that characters decide to run from hideout to hideout during a dino brawl when all they have to do is simply leave the premises. But I digress. Jurassic World provides everything a fan of the franchise could ever want — the monstrous reptiles are back (though they looked less computer animated in the '93 original) and better than ever, and the new cast is sound. By keeping in mind that nothing new will be in store, Jurassic World will make for a satisfying, well-made update.",Jurassic World

303,ctowyi,A Dino-Mayhem-Disaster Flick Populated by Staple One-Note Characters,6,12 June 2015,"Once again it's a dino-mayhem-disaster flick populated by staple one-note characters - a couple of kids from a fractured family, a ""are they going to or are they not"" couple, a shady corporate bigwig, a ""Dr Evil"" type and so on. Thank goodness one of them is Chris Pratt who is the epitome of cool. Love the way he calmly plays his character, dripping with killer machismo and testosterone. Think Steve McQueen. Chris Pratt is the new old. Who cares about the other characters anyway?It took quite a while to get going but once the mayhem started it is actually quite a rollicking good time. The story pays homage to Spielberg's Jurassic Park and I find it a bit laborious and self-conscious in that some of the homages roar in my face. The theme of corporate greed is again highlighted in rainbow colors and underlined in bold strokes, and there is just so much one can milk it. Why the heck people don't seem to learn? But I am getting ahead of myself. After all these are people in the movie world. The problem is that the narrative feels too familiar and it very soon became repetitive, but still it is really a logical extension from the idea posed in Jurassic Park, a ""what if"" brought to full fruition - a full-fledged dinosaur theme park.Colin Trevorrow's storytelling is uneven and the tone feels a little unsettled. It feels like he was hovering around ""shall I give my due respect to Spielberg"" or ""shall I do my thing"", but it couldn't quite figure out what it wants to do. The tone can also feel preachy (especially the long exposition in the beginning) and goofy, and it doesn't feel like it was comfortable blazing its own path. Thankfully Pratt's character smooths out the ragged edges for me. The poster of him on a bike with the raptors made no sense, but after the movie it made perfect awesome sense.Jurassic World didn't re-invent the dino-disaster wheel. I doubt that is its aim. IMHO it is a greatest hits album packaged with a few remixes of old tracks. Like a theme park ride, you would easily push the lousy parts like the long wait to the back of your mind, and only remember the thrills and spills.",Jurassic World
304,ivko,"Up next: Mercedes Benz presents Dinos Down Main Street, USA!",5,14 June 2015,"I really wanted to like this movie. I was only a wee lad when the first Jurassic Park came out ( OK, a teenage wee lad, but still ). The only live action dinosaurs I had ever seen were the rubbery land of the lost style claymation ones, so a film with realistic giant lizards just blew my mind. With each subsequent film though, I watched with increasing disappointment as they seemed to run out of ideas and milked the concept dry. After Jurassic Park III came out in 2001 a pale imitation of the original, it seemed as though the franchise had finally burned itself out and I was fine with that.Still, a decade and a half later when they announced a new Jurassic movie I found myself getting excited despite my previous misgivings. It seemed as though they had found a way to revitalize the concept; instead of a constant parade of rich idiots trying and failing to harness the power of an extinct world, we instead got to witness a Jurassic World theme park fully realized. Disney, but with dinosaurs. And with Chris Pratt as the leading man, having just starred in the Guardians movie as a surprisingly good action hero, I was really looking forward to seeing him as a no-nonsense dino wrangler.And to be fair, he is one of the things the movie gets right. The Jurassic movies have always had a certain ""fall to your knees before mother nature"" flavor of preachiness to them, one that screeched to a crescendo with Vince Vaughn's Van Owen character in The Lost World. And Pratt's character Owen has that same undertone, but delivered in a much more balanced and palatable format that makes its point without being overbearing. Add to that fourteen years of improvements in CGI that makes dinosaurs so realistic you can almost believe they are out there somewhere and it seems like a winning combination. Seriously, even the first Jurassic Park, as groundbreaking as it was, had moments where you could see through the illusion. Not so here. The dinosaurs in JW are so life-like that you pretty much never get pulled out of the story by the visuals. If I was an actor, I would be seriously concerned about where these capabilities will be in another decade or two.But unfortunately, this brings us to the end of what JW did right. There are a lot of little things that annoyed me in the film, but really it boils down to two big things. The first is just that the entire thing is not believable. I don't mean impossible; with many movies you have something that would make the story impossible in the real world. A McGuffin, if you will. You start with the real universe, the one you and I live in, and you add something to it. Maybe it's faster than light spaceships, or time travel, or maybe it's a shockingly dangerous school to teach children magic. As a viewer you can suspend disbelief for whatever it is and just enjoy the story. What is important is that after you have made your changes to the universe your story from that point on has to be consistent with the rules you have established; characters have to behave in a way that is logically consistent with the universe you have created or the audience will feel like you are manipulating them.So if you have created a world that is just like ours except that there are hordes of flesh eating zombies all around, and then have a character that lives in that world get killed while they chill in a backyard hammock, singing at the top of their lungs, eyes closed listening to their IPod, it will tick people off *because nobody who lived in that world would ever do that*. You know, unless they were suicidal or something. That's what I mean about believable.And this is where JW breaks down in a big way. Obviously they need for something to go wrong so that the dinosaurs can break loose and create mayhem, but they choose to do it in a way that is completely inconsistent with how anyone in that world would actually behave. They have them make decisions that are so obscenely stupid that you almost find yourself hoping they will get eaten just as punishment for being so cartoonishly arrogant and foolhardy. And then three quarters of the way through the movie they double down on the gambit and do it again! It shatters the illusion. I'm not going to go into details because I don't want to post spoilers, but trust me; you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.The second major problem I had with the movie is about how females are portrayed in it. The friend I went to see the movie with is a woman, and she was kind of upset by the heavy 'damsel in distress' theme of the movies only major female character, who is one of the aforementioned characters making obnoxiously stupid decisions during the film. Her role seems to primarily be to put thousands of people in mortal danger and then to run around screaming and cowering behind Pratt. And I mean really, we live in a post-Katniss world now people. She took down a fascist regime with just a bow and arrow; a woman can kick *ss and melt the heart, I think. Do we really need to cling to this saved by the big strong man theme anymore?Anyway, the last thing I'll mention is that I saw the film in IMAX 3D and I have to say that it didn't add much to the experience. A few cool helicopter scenes, but that was about all. If you are going to see it, stick with the standard viewing and save a few bucks.",Jurassic World

I haven't seen the original trilogy for over 10 years so couldn't remember much about them, therefore they was not in my mind when watching the new version. I enjoyed Jurassic World so much that I am now going to make it a high priority of mine to go back and watch the original.The new theme park looks amazing, in fact everything about the film is visually stunning. The story is straight to the point and doesn't overcompensate where it doesn't need to, there is two kids going to the theme park, their auntie is in charge and Owen (Chris Pratt) is basically a dinosaur trainer. The kids go off on their own (that car ball vehicle thing was super cool by the way) and then of course dinosaurs get out of hand and run loose causing mayhem across the park.The action scenes were breathtaking and go on for a good chunk of the film. I wanted entertainment and I definitely got it. Everything about the film was just thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. There was even a few scenes that made me laugh out loud. I really liked each character in the film and the 120 minute run time flew by.Without saying too much, Jurassic World is my #1 film of 2015 so far and my favourite of the Jurassic Park franchise. I highly recommend it.",Jurassic World
307,totalovrdose,"Disappointing: Much like the Dinosaurs this Film Represents, the Jurassic Park Franchise ought to Remain Extinct",6,10 June 2015,"Don't get me wrong - there is plenty of entertainment to be had when viewing Jurassic World: the special effects are absolutely outstanding, and we are able to cherish these when viewing the creatures right up in our faces. Unlike many films where monsters are hidden by the darkness, in this film, they are beautifully presented in direct visibility. Not only this, many of the action scenes are truly breathtaking in their execution, the climatic moments being especially fantastic, however, these are often marred by predictability, the final sequence being a combination of several fight scenes from the original feature, and Jurassic Park 3. Regrettably, in other instances, including a scene involving pterosaurs, and another involving raptors, the script's directionality offers nothing new, as we watch what can only be described as tweaked footage from previous installments, regardless of how good they look. This is unfortunately furthered by the fact that those who have viewed the trailers, will already have a strong inkling of what is going to happen in almost every major scene.Although In-Gen still have a role to play in the feature, their priorities appear to be strictly military, a tactic which is strongly led by Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who efficaciously portrays his greedy, self-centered character. Although the notion of using dinosaurs, particularly raptors, during military operations is interesting, and seeing this executed on screen is probably the most uniquely entertaining experience the film is able to muster, this grand scheme seems outlandishly ridiculous. Furthermore, at times, it seems difficult to fathom who is actually in control - Hoskins, or park owner Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who is introduced as one of the world's richest men, and though he is hailed as a man with 'humility', the moment everything goes terribly wrong, money and reputation, rather than safety, are his top priorities. Despite a number of superb scenes, for the most part, his character recites juvenile dialogue, and it left this writer wondering if Mr. Khan was sadly, racially chosen because of his accent.This is not helped by the script, which, despite the seriousness of the operation, doesn't always retain the professionalization one would expect. Characters like Scott (Andy Buckley), who is provided far too much screen time, spends the entirety of his scenes vocalizing what can only be described as pointless dialogue, while characters like Dr. Henry Wu (B D Wong), who terrifically shows the passion he has for his work, are rarely glimpsed. Even Owen, although exceptionally portrayed by the dashingly handsome Chris Pratt, whose character is a reliably effective protagonist, is initially provided some rather sexist material, conveyed in the scene where he communicates with former girlfriend and operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who, despite been an effective marketer, spends more than half the film being interpreted as an emotionless zealot.This impression is only furthered by her inability to be an aunt to her sister's two children vacationing at the park, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson). More often than not, these children appear to steal the show, much of the plot, from the film's opening to its close, orbiting around them, and though this allows us to see the park from their eyes, their behavior, and recklessness, quickly loses its appeal. The addendum that Zach, no offense, is a sleaze bag, doesn't help: the opening of the feature sees him saying goodbye to his girlfriend, and for half the movie, he has the gall to attempt fraternization with every adolescent girl he sees.Moving on, the primary antagonist, the Indominus Rex, the creature scientifically engineered by splicing together classified dinosaur genetics, which predictably escapes, is able to masterfully command the screen with its presence, though at the same time, its unique capabilities appear to be randomly used. On many an occasion it appears the creature is capable of doing what was convenient for the scene; almost as though the monster itself is unsure of its capabilities and learns overtime from practice. Despite its massive build, more could have been done to make this creature more terrifying, and the fact it too closely resembles a Tyrannosaurs, renders it less effective on screen as it would have, if it looked vastly different.The sub-plot, about humans forming a bond with dinosaurs is a nice addition to the narrative, and helps establish the ancient reptiles as more than just killing machines, but as potentially loyal animals, however, the fact the Indominus steals the show, severely limits the effectiveness of this story arch. Additionally, the accompanying musical score occasionally adds to the environment, however, the original John Williams theme appears to be recklessly handled, and is inserted in what seems to be the most inappropriate of locations.In conclusion, our return to the park feels less than impressive, and more stereotypically cliché, and despite the term 'world' appearing in its title, the staggering number of Caucasians, makes it seem the 'world' is barely represented at all. The fact the film is left wide open for yet another sequel, a little too obviously demonstrates Universal's opinion they have tapped a lucrative oil well, however, any further forays into the park are only likely to end in disaster. If you are thoroughly impressed by Mr. Pratt's work, I would recommend you watch this film; if you really enjoy Mr. Khan's on screen presence, I would recommend you avoid this feature, and for fans of the franchise still reeling after the abysmal third movie, I would recommend you stick to the original two films.",Jurassic World
308,kunalkhandwala,Take this ride back to the Lost World...,8,20 June 2015,"There are few things as spectacular as a helicopter flying through the lush landscapes of Hawaii with that epic background score by John Williams that marks our escape to a magical land of the re-generated dinosaurs. In almost every scene, director Colin Trevorrow's sincere attempt at visualizing things in Spielberg's manner is conspicuous. With a massive budget compared to his debut Indie film, Trevorrow pushes the benchmark of special effects to give us more realistic thrills and creatures that are quite terrifying. John Hammond's dream of creating a theme park has been fulfilled without incident for 10 years now but corporate greed and people's desire for extreme entertainment leads to yet another disaster on Isla Nublar. As inhuman as it may sound, the fictional threat to human lives has seldom been so entertaining. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the Manager at Jurassic World where customer sentiment analysis, feedback scores and revenue growth demand more of her attention than her 2 nephews who are visiting the park for a week. Zach (Nick Robinson) attempts to flirt by just staring at girls while his younger, nerdier brother Gray (Ty Simpkins) is obsessed with the park and its creatures. For Claire however, the problem with the park now, is its need to evolve. Existing Dinosaurs aren't impressive anymore according to her research reports and the visitors seek more thrills with bigger, louder and scarier creatures bearing more teeth. Thus, within the confines of a solid walled enclosure, wanders a creature in solitude with the DNA of a T-Rex, Cuttlefish, tree fog and another secret animal. This hybrid monster is the highly evolved, intelligent and aggressive Indominus Rex. Claire calls upon Owen (Chris Pratt), who has been busy training Velociraptors to follow his orders, to evaluate the safety of the I-Rex enclosure before they open it as an attraction. Before they could even realize it, Indominus has displayed his superior intelligence and is now posing a threat to the park's other creatures and about 20,000 visitors. Owen and his bad-ass heroics will have to rescue Claire's nephews from their adventurous ride in the impressive gyroscope that went awry and then attempt to track Indominus before things get worse. The aerial attack by pteranodons and killing rampage by Indominus wreak havoc and panic in the park whereas any sentimental affinity towards baby triceratopses and the dying Brontosaurus will only result in horrid disbelief. The creatures are truly terrifying in their own way. Much like we witnessed in last year's 'Godzilla', fleeting views of Indominus and a trail of his destruction provide the terror rather than his full-sized presence on screen. The Velociraptors are vicious, as expected and they possess enough intelligence to make them unpredictable. They are also a part of the film's iconic chase sequence with Pratt racing with them on his motorcycle in the hunt for Indominus. The showdown is between a hybrid and its predecessor, once again reminding us of 'Godzilla's' climax. There are several scenes that pay tribute to 'Jurassic Park' with the human-dinosaur interaction, re-visiting original buildings that now lay in ruin and several easter eggs that John Hammond would be proud of. These tributes are of course Trevorrow's salute to Spielberg himself, who is also the executive producer of this record-shattering blockbuster. Even though the creatures dominate this thrilling ride into a lost world, the human characters attempt to peek through the chaos, reflecting the tension, uncertainty, emotions and just a hint of levity. Jurassic World is merely a fun summer movie that has matured after the 2 sequels, often to the extent that it could give kids nightmares. But the consumer wanted bigger, badder, scarier creatures with more teeth. Trevorrow delivered all that and more. His direction kept the flow of action steady with enough build up initially to set up all the thrills. Its flaws can be overlooked for the sheer excitement that a visit to the park provides and several of the sequences containing the remarkable special effects are awe inspiring. Needless to say, it is a must-watch for an entire generation that grew up fascinated by Michael Crichton's imaginative world, realized by a master film-maker. Trevorrow's World is a ride worth taking into that lost world. Buckle up.8.471 on a scale of 1-10.",Jurassic World

This is is set 22 years after the first events of Jurrasic Park. The park has built a hybrid that becomes a problem, when it escapes captivity. Chris Pratt plays a guy who loves looking after the dinos and becomes heroic with his actions later. This is pure cinematic entertainment. Just a great popcorn flick. I think this is fun for ages 10 and up. Some scenes are a little scary. The dino's look great and technology has come a long way since the first film in 1993. If you want a great summer blockbuster this is it. Steven Spielberg has made a career, and basically invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws. He didn't direct, but you can see his influence with just the pure entertainment of it all.I do recommend this film",Jurassic World
312,abouhelier-r,Jurassic World,9,14 June 2015,"Twenty-two years after the events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. After 10 years of operation and visitor rates declining, in order to fulfil a corporate mandate, a new attraction is created to re-spark visitor's interest, which backfires horribly.""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" those words disclaimed and the music will be graved into my memory forever. When I saw the first Jurassic Park I had my mind blown, it was like cinema has been reinvented decades before and coming to life right in front of me. It made generations want to be directors, actors, writers: story tellers. It was a breakthrough movie with the use of technology and new cgi. Jurassic World depicts (at first) everything John Hammond wanted this place to be and it's fully operational. Here, the film renews the experience and transports us where Jurassic Park took us 22 years ago; capturing only a fraction of the original film's overflowing awe and wonder though. I didn't go to this movie hoping it to be better because lets be honest: it won't, ever; but just hoping it it would be good. The 14 years-layoffs since the last one may have helped to ease the mind of antiseptics. In fact, Universal's big summer action release is sufficiently ""toothsome"" to make audiences everywhere happy for a return visit to a once-wild world that looks as safe as a Disney ride. The first wise move was to pretend that The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic Park III (2001) never existed and that the world depicted here descends directly from Spielberg's 1993 adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel. This line of reasoning takes us to the current star attraction of the park, in the form of a gigantic sea creature that zooms straight up out of its pool to swallow in one bite a big white shark: a spectacle which inclined to interpret as a ingenious admission by Steven Spielberg as to how far the world has moved on since Jaws. This film is as its core a caution about the dangers of trying to keep up by doing always bigger, better and faster. From the beginning, fuelled by Michael Crichton's big brain, Jurassic Park has always been a debate about the boundaries of science and here that explored further. It's an example of scientist's being so preoccupied with whether they could that they stopped thinking if they should. It's at once a sharp comment on our been-there-done-that generation which so quickly gets bored with the new and a genuinely menacing monster movie. The same thing could be said for our cinema industry and the global corporates that dictate the films we get every year. This movie lays out a really clever and thinly veiled critique nowadays blockbuster mentality. Jurassic world features a story about humankind's fallibility and inclination to bring destruction upon itself. Plus, there's something about director Colin Trevorrow's approach that marks him as a humanist rather than a director determined to hammer you into submission. Characters wise, Bryce Dallas Howard appears as the third generation of damsel in distress with a light touch of feminism, quite like Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). They set up a stereotype of the uptight and over controlling girl, to knock it down afterwards; while nodding to our contemporary views, as we get a heroine who can take out a dinosaur with a stun gun and also run very fast away from them in heels. It's not hard to see why Joss Whedon tweeted, that early footage of her made him think of ""70's era sexism"". It doesn't help that, rather foolishly, she spends the entire film in high heels; even sprinting in them, in one slow-mo sequence. More importantly, Chris Pratt is a sort of velociraptors whisperer, appealingly playing a watered-down Indiana Jones type of guy. With his charisma on screen he cements his reputation as movie's new leading man, giving a tremendously likable performance as Owen: easy going and relaxed, somewhere between Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks. If Guardians of the Galaxy Peter Quill was Pratt's Han Solo, then Owen is his Indiana Jones. He completely blew me away.Treverrow opted for a Spielbergian slow build as we don't see any dinosaur until roughly 20 minutes in the film. Moreover, he needed something new: enters the genetically engineered Indominus Rex. If a character noted early on in the movie that ""no one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" let me tell you that you should have seen my face as I enjoyed every bit of them on screen. The problem is not that much that dinosaurs have ceased to impress but that dinosaurs and few good characters alone are not enough to sustain us in a sophisticated blockbuster culture that has the emotional landscape of Inside Out, the fugitive craziness of Fury Road and the all too human ape leader Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Those movies are as bold in their storytelling and as rich in their emotional stakes as they are in their visual aspects. There are lots of characters and lots of subplots that doesn't really belong in the film which create storytelling flaws, where the story goes back to less important characters such as the two brothers and their family problems, then you're like ""Can we focus on our core here?!"" Besides the self aware old fashion thrill and heroism, the romance when it flares is swift, unexpected and makes the heart leap. Furthermore the dinosaurs themselves have rarely looked better than they do under the direction of VFX supervisor Tim Alexander and it's what makes Jurassic World such a breathless summer entertainment.Check out the rest of the review here > http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/2015/06/jurassic-world.html",Jurassic World
313,bayardhiler,Dinosaur Mayhem with a little Nostalgia Here and There,7,15 June 2015,"Anyone who remembers seeing ""Jurassic Park"" as a kid for the first time knew they were going to see the promised dinosaur extravaganza ""Jurassic World"", no matter how good or bad it was. Luckily, I'm happy to say, the film was entertaining and it gave fans a little bit of what they always wanted to see: An opened and functional park that goes from being a dream to a nightmare! The story begins with two young boys - Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his older brother Zach (Nick Robinson) - on their way to Jurassic World as special guests of their aunt, park curator Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). But, as you can probably guess, this isn't the best time for them to visit because soon, the park's new attraction, the genetically created Indominus Rex, will break loose and create, in the words of Dr. Malcolm, ""the essence of chaos."" With the the help of raptor whisperer Owen (Starlord himself, Chris Pratt!), does the group stand a chance? Lets start with the good. As someone who loved dinosaurs as a kid, this film delivers some of the best dinosaur action in years! The Indominus Rex is awesome looking, and as you probably know from the previews, this isn't your grandfather's T-Rex. It's highly intelligent, can camouflage, see in fared, and is something you don't what to come across (All the more reason why we should just go ahead and create it!). As the main villain of the film, the Indominus works as a constant and credible threat to the characters. Another dinosaur plus is the introduction of the sea reptile, the Mesosaurus, something that was never included in any of the previous installments. As for acting, I'd say everyone here did a good job, though the human star of the show is Chris Pratt. Channeling the cocky energy of his character from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", Pratt provides some of the humor relief as well as a center of sanity in an insane situation. So much so, Pratt does a good job making you believe his character is capable of actually training raptors. Bryce Dallas Howard also gives a decent performance of the uptight Claire (Some have said her performance was forced, but I thought it was okay) as does Vincent D'Onofrio as Hoskins, a man seeking to use the raptors and Indominus as military weapons (What do you think the chances are of that succeeding!). The two kids here are okay, and at least they're not annoying enough that we want them to get eaten. It also helps that the filmmakers include a little nostalgia here and there, whether it's the cameo of Mr. DNA in the visitors' center, the casting of B.D. Wong in the role of Dr. Wu (the only actor to appear from any of the previous films) or seeing the remains of the old Jurassic Park and one of those old Jeep Wranglers. As for bad, there were some parts of the film that felt kind of forced, such as in the beginning when they were playing the theme music and trying to capture the magic from the first film but didn't quite succeed. Another issue concerns the level of CGI used. Anyone hoping for some animatronic action will be disappointed, as their is only one scene that features it. While some of the dinosaurs looked good in CGI, such as the Indominus and the raptors, on others it looks a bit cartoonish. Case in point, the T-Rex. Supposedly, this is the same T-Rex featured in the first film but you wouldn't know that by looking at it! The thing doesn't look anywhere near as cool and threatening as it did in the first one, particularly because its head looks a lot smaller and is poorly drawn. For all the money put into this film, you'd think they could have done a better job with it. Another issue is the lack of explanation as to how and why the park managed to be reopened. We know that the park has been open for about ten years but the film doesn't really give much background plot, something that I was really hoping to see. All in all, while ""Jurassic World"" is entertaining, it doesn't have quite manage to create that feeling of magic or awe that the first and even the second one were able to create, a magic you can still feel no matter how many times you watch them. Never the less, the movie is a big improvement over the third installment - which I don't think was quite as bad as some people said but no where near as good as the first two - and in the end, that's all we can ask. Either way, no matter how you feel about it, the movie's going to make a boatload of cash. If you're looking for some dinosaur fun and maybe even to capture some nostalgia of being a kid again, ""Jurassic World"" isn't a bad way to do it.",Jurassic World
314,stephendaxter,"The sequel we deserve, as Jurassic World takes the franchise back to its roots",9,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World was to put it simply; AWESOME!!! It was the sequel to Jurassic Park that we deserved, and after all this time we finally got it with this film. This film did somehow managed to capture all of the tones that were set by the first film, the thriller aspects were there, the horror, the fun, and the comedy were all present, making it a thrilling ride the whole way through. Chris Pratt was the one mainly bringing the comedic elements that the first film had and he was such a great character. As well as Pratt, the performances across the board were all great from Ty Simpkins to Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio they were all very convincing and you could see the fear in their faces the whole time. That fear of course was of the dinosaurs, and they come out in full force and are terrifying, giving you goosebumps every time they show up, from the velociraptors to the brand new guy they were all amazing. The CGI and light touch of practical effects were incredible and really made you seem like you were looking at the real thing.In terms of the plot i was really impressed, it didn't go all dumb like in Jurassic Park 3 and was very interesting and suspenseful. It manages to keep you thoroughly entertained for the entire duration offering enough new elements to be fresh while also keeping what made the original so great. There was a subplot involving Vincent D'Onofrio's character that is constantly hinted at throughout the entire film, and for most of the film it felt very out of place. The homages to the first film made me enjoy it a lot more and gave me goosebumps whenever something is referenced. From the very familiar soundtrack to some............ other things it really made this feel like a true Jurassic Park sequel. In the end this was a fantastic film and if you loved the first one you will also love this one, it doesn't quite reach the level the first one did but it blew 2 and 3 out of the water making this the real sequel. - 8.8",Jurassic World
315,spencergrande6,"Really Dumb, Not That Pretty",5,18 July 2016,"The worst kind of dumb movie - one that pretends to be smart but in a subtle way like it's endearing or something. Except this movie really and truly is stupid. There's a certain kind of suspension of disbelief in any movie, especially one about rampaging dinosaurs. But at a certain point, too many suspensions kills the movie. It's not asking once or twice for dramatic effect, it's literally every twist and turn.The main premise is simply inane. Apparently, 10 years after the first Jurassic Park was by all accounts an unmitigated disaster, and then a T-Rex destroyed a good chunk of San Diego, people just kind of forget about all that and open a park anyway and customers and lawyers and everyone else doesn't care anymore. Maybe that's smart though? Maybe the movie is asking whether anything is sacred when a quick buck can be made?Also, people are bored of dinosaurs already. The park has been open for 10 years and there's only one in the entire world with a limited amount of people being given access so they decide to create a new dinosaur. Not some new, cool looking dinosaur, just a more dangerous one because people really like to watch meat get torn up on hooks. But maybe this is smart too? This is a self-reflexive movie commenting on its own status in the summer blockbuster marketplace, where dinosaurs aren't scary or amazing enough anymore - people want more and bigger and louder and with more superheroes! Maybe this is smart too? You'd be hard pressed to find any more evidence throughout the movie. Maybe that scene of the older kid staring at girls while a T- Rex eats a sheep in the background (wow, meta) except maybe also that's his character development and he just likes girls and he's maturing and well I don't know. He likes the Mosasaurus that jumps out of the water to eat a shark, apparently that's better than a T-Rex because it's newer and differenter (though we are given no inclination that either of these two have ever been here before). Which would seem to undermine the entire movie because it's entire existence is based on homage to the original films. So what is it? A new movie for old fans full of service, or new fans who are jaded of summer blockbusters. Who knows?Velociraptors are getting dumber but like in a really smart way. Remember how we watched them open door handles, work together, plot and plan, set traps, protect their young? Now they listen to humans. Like dogs. You know how dogs are really smart for sitting when they get a treat? Yeah, Velociraptors can respond to Pavlovian triggers too. Pretty amazing. In fact, they're so smart that when they meet the rampaging Indominus Rex they immediately abandon their Pavlovian loyalty to Chris Pratt and start following it because....I don't know. Somehow they blindly listen to a dinosaur that they have never met before and in which there is no genetic blueprint for ever having existed before. But they know it's one of them. Then they switch sides again at the end because he bad.All the dinosaurs look like they did in the original movies even though scientific advances over the last two decades have shown where we were wrong. Some dinosaurs had feathers, Velociraptors could maybe fly a bit with wing-like arms. There are actually raptors that resemble the fictional big ones in these movies (Utahraptors) but you won't find that stuff here. A smart choice, writing into the movie that people want the dinosaurs they are familiar with (you know the ones from the original movies, the movies that don't exist in this world because they were real life, where you know they got the dinosaurs wrong and everyone who saw them mostly died...or whatever).So nice, they genetically modified them to look different. Makes sense. Except people are jaded by these old dinos right? They only want new ones like the Mosasaurus? So why make the old ones when people want new ones? Why not make all the dinosaurs look more realistic, or create new ones not yet seen in the movies so that they are new and people aren't jaded and then there would be no need for Indominus Rex. This one simple subplot completely undermines another one. It can't decide what people are. Jaded and uneasily impressed, or just nostalgic rubes who can't process anything new?Much like the subplots involving the kid's parent's divorce and the British woman watching the kids who does nothing the whole movie and then gets mercilessly killed for about three minutes straight while the real bad guy in the movie dies off screen in about three seconds. Because the Mosasaurus had to be shown again. So people would remember by the finale. When the epic Indominus Rex vs T-Rex battle is about to conclude (a moment that wants to be so cool, yet Jurassic Park III had the good sense to put this 15 minutes into the movie. Remember that? JP3 had the Spinosaurus murder a T- Rex to establish where it was on the food chain, to raise the stakes for the rest of the movie. A smart move, in a smart dumb movie.) Here they don't even have a Spinosaurus, they have a T-Rex who gets killed and then Mosasaurus leaps up and eats everyone. Right up onto the main paths that customers use and where all the shops are. Apparently there are no fences or protection there against it. It could have, all this time, for the entirety of this park's existence have jumped up and started eating people no problem. What?!",Jurassic World
316,SpoilerAlertReviews,Better than the previous sequel but still not as good as 'Park',7,8 September 2016,"I think it was a brave decision for studios to give Colin Trevorrow the helm for the final Jurassic film. I really like his Safety Not Guaranteed but to then give him a project of this size and history was quite surprising. I'm not going to bang on about the previous sequels that were nothing near the original Jurassic Park. I remember watching JP at the cinema, 22 years ago, and hearing those quaking footsteps and seeing the shaking glass of water was intense, as are the Velociraptors in the kitchen. Spielberg even let himself down with Lost World so to follow up with another film was rather brash. I wouldn't be surprised if the makers and studios watched the previous film listing all the elements that worked and stood out as there seems to be a lot of the same ingredients. Kids isolated, Velociraptors and of course a tyrannosaurs rex, but bigger and stronger. The same tension is there with looming dinosaurs and I think the only original cast member is BD Wong, playing the naughty scientist. It almost feels like a reboot as oppose to a continuation. Fans of Chris Pratt should like his character but non-fans will probably hate this, playing the sarcastic, over confident dino-trainer. Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning in this, and both play their characters very well adding the awkward romance. Vincent D'Onofrio and Jake Johnson join the cast, Vinny being the nasty guy with an angle and JJ providing some comedy relief as the tech guy. But it's Irrfan Khan that steals the show for me, being acclaimed as one of the greatest actors of our time, he hails from Bollywood and does a tremendous job playing billionaire dare-devil Masrani. Disney regular composer, Michael Giacchino takes on the Jurassic theme following John William's note steps. Not quite the same, but still very good and follows suite. The CGI is on point as expected but again mimics a lot of scene from the original, though the close ups are superb. There's some clever ideas and twists to the story that make it more silly than good cinema, especially the climatic end. But certain scenes are good and have captured the essence of its '93 father. The children in the snow globe mobile in particular was classic Park stuff. That same tension is there and the ghastly dino is ferociously scary. The aerial shots were a nice touch. Jurassic World is better than the sequels but still not the T-Rex of dinosaur movies, that crown still remains with Jurassic Park. Trevorrow did a great job, so faith restored, but I think it's time to close the park for good.

Massive kudos to Bryce Dallas Howard for all the running she did in those heels.I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of references to the first Jurassic Park; I expected at least one but there were quite a few and not ones that were thrown in your face either.I'll be interested to see the story for, the inevitable, sequel because who is going to go to another park?An enjoyable, entertaining movie that I will see again in the cinemas and will definitely be an addition to my bluray collection.",Jurassic World

319,Spartan_1_1_7,"Entertaining and Thrilling, even if it doesn't reach the same heights as the Original.",7,25 July 2015,"""Monster is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.""We finally get to go back to Isla Nublar after all these years (22 to be exact). It is a given that creating the same feel and magic of Jurassic Park is impossible. SO instead of just trying to recreate everything and doing it in a lesser way, director Colin Trevorrow went with a different approach and it actually payed off. Jurassic World takes place 22 years after the events of the original film. A new park after the events of the original film, on the same place, was opened and has been functioning for 10 years. They create a hybrid dinosaur as a new attraction but everything goes to hell when it gets loose. Now, I had somewhat low expectations going into the movie and while it wasn't as good as the original, nor did it had its magic and feeling (obviously), it turned out to be a whole another entertaining ride. The movie did a good enough job of paying homage to the original. Couple of scenes had the awesome John William's original score and they just had this very nostalgic and awesome feeling to it. I just wished they used more of it, and some of it in a better way. Chris Pratt was great as the lead. This guy just has a natural charisma about him and the character he played was likable and badass. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard character as well. She seemed like a typical corporate emotionless being at first but actually developed into something likable. Another thing that was surprising was that the KIDS DID NOT ANNOY ME. Something that rarely happens in movies. Their brotherly bond stuff went fine with the movie. Other characters were either OK or a huge miss.As mentioned earlier, the director went with a different approach. The movie was more of a summer blockbuster monster film, with some of the Jurassic Park elements to it. Many fans might be disappointed by this fact but I was fine with it. Better to have a generic/typical entertaining film instead of a lame recreation attempt. The greatly teased indominous-rex, the hybrid dinosaur, was awesome. The movie did a great job of showing it as this unstoppable monster science and corporate greed created. It was smart, it was ruthless and it was what a monster should be like. The raptors, which have always had huge importance in Jurassic Park franchise, were yet again great here. The whole training them scenario was risky and I didn't know what to expect from it but the way movie handled it was really pleasing. The dinosaur scenes ranged from good to great, with the finale being OH SO SATISFYING. Seriously, my inner dinosaur/Jurassic Park fan was screaming with joy in the last 10-15 mins. The CGI was mostly great. There were some inconsistencies here and there but they weren't that distracting. The soundtrack, apart from the original's, wasn't that great or unique or memorable though. Now the movie definitely had plot issues. I mean the whole idea of creating a hybrid dinosaur because the park is losing its spark sounded really absurd. Also, there were some really stupid moments, created for the convenience of moving the film forward, where you just can't let it slide. Also, the movie had this synthetic feel to it in a lot of scenes. I guess it was because of the lighting and too much use of CGI. It didn't had that gritty and naturalistic feel of the original. All in all, the movie had its quirks but I still had a good time with it. It was entertaining and thrilling, just like how a summer blockbuster should be. Whether you're a fan of the original or just wanna have a good time, this is a must watch. 7.8/10",Jurassic World
320,AnishMisra,Jurassic World review,8,29 June 2017,"Jurassic World is a film directed by Colin Trevorrow. Initially, I had no interest in seeing this film. I thought basically its just dinosaurs running here and there. But I watched the first film again. I became a fan of it. I skipped the next 2 (basically because of its reviews). I watched this. And I was overjoyed.Plot: When an Indominous Rex gets out of hand in the newly built Jurassic World, its upto the authorities to get a control on the species.Story and direction: Now I went into this film knowing that it couldn't be in level with the first part. That was ultimate. But I was expecting a decent film. And yes, I got that. The VFX and camera work both are good. The dinosaurs looked a little 'faked' at times although the character designs for the dinosaurs were great. Hey, but that's just me. The film actually takes a little time to start, about 20 minutes. But after that, it was bang on. I liked the entry to Owen's character. He showed that there is a great promise to this franchise. The story was basically here and there. There were subplots that were kind of distracting me. The kids were kind of unnecessary. It felt as if they were recreating the first that also had two kids!!!! And using raptors as military weapons!!! That was atrocious. Here that was not even necessary. The climatic battle between the dinosaurs was a visual treat to the eyes.Performances: Chris Pratt proved that he can do roles other than the Star Lord. Bryce Dallas was also great. Vincent D'Onofrio was good as the semi-villain (although the part was not needed). The kids were also fantastic in their roles. Irrfan Khan again proved that why I loved him. B D Wong was OK.Favorite Scene: I guess it would be the scene after Chris Pratt's entry. The communication and bond that was shown between the dinos and humans was phenomenal. I hoped that this theme would have been further explored in the film.Verdict: Jurassic World is actually a good film. It has some flaws but it is watchable. Definitely not better than the original. Can't actually wait for Fallen Kingdom to come.I am giving it an 8/10.",Jurassic World

There is so much bloodshed it's not even funny. I don't know how this movie didn't get an R rating like the rest of them.But anyways, A New theme park on the same island the first movie took place attracts many visitors. But they are getting tired of dinosaurs. So what do they do? Make another one! But it goes haywire and it's up to a trainer and the owner of the park to find her nephews because she is obviously a bad aunt and is too immersed in work.Where to begin, first off, lets talk about the ending. Why? I mean, seriously. The ending shot of the T Rex on top of the helicopter pad made me hold back tears of how powerful this was. Chris Pratt. He gets better in every movie he is in. He is going to be the next big action star no doubt. He did great in this movie also. So it's no surprise that he will become a force of nature in the movie industry.The visuals are good also, although not up to standards of the first film. The shot of the dead dinosaurs sent chills down my spine.Jurassic World is a great movie. I can't say much more. But seriously, it made me respect the series more. I'm not a big fan of Jurassic Park but I loved this movie a lot.91/100 A-",Jurassic World
322,schroeder-gustavo,Worst JP Sequel,4,11 June 2015,"So I'm wondering if Hollywood will ever just stop making dumb sequels that simply do not need to exist. But I am pretty sure they will never do that and now we get Jurassic Park 4 or, better known as Jurassic World. The movie is almost a complete disaster and is pretty much only saved by the likability of Chris Pratt, who is great in this movie and he shows his charisma once more after the excellent Guardians of the Galaxy. The first thing that bothered me about the movie from literally the first scene is the overuse of CGI. What made the original so good in terms of effects was that they only used CGI when necessary and went all the way with creating amazing practical effects, which still hold up beautifully today. Everything in this movie is a Computer generated orgy, nothing seems real and, to be honest it doesn't even look that good. Another big issue with the movie is the complete lack of interesting characters or development thereof. Like I said before, the only real character in the movie with whom the audience can identify with is Chris Pratt's character. The movie does get away with a few positive things, like in playing homage to the first three Jurassic Park movies, which I think Jurassic World does very well, at times. Another positive is in my opinion is Bryce Dallas Howard's performance, which is good, although her character is shallow and unrealistic. I hated some of the things they did with the franchise, though. Like for example turning the Asian scientist that is in the original JP into a bad guy. Also, Raptors can now be trained? Seriously? So Jurassic World is almost a complete train wreck, but it kinda gets saved by a few good performances and a good use of the nostalgia factor for the original, which will certainly win some audiences over. But not me, because Jurassic World is just, plain and simple, a bad movie.",Jurassic World
323,caseynicholson,The Best Film of the Franchise,8,26 July 2015,"Having never seen any of the Jurassic Park movies, I set out to watch them all in preparation for ""Jurassic World"". I wasn't a huge fan of the series. The first film was far superior to the next two sequels, but I must say that this most recent effort, ""Jurassic World"", is the best of the series.The gist of the film is that society has white washed all the problems of the first three movies and rebuilt a new theme park that, in a struggle to gain visitors, genetically engineers dinosaurs to be bigger and better than before. As you can guess, that turns out to be a bad idea.Chris Pratt's acting makes the movie fresh, as does the storyline. The production is well done overall, which is something that I really couldn't say for the second and third films in the series. I've rated this movie at an 8, the same rating I gave the original. This franchise as a whole just really isn't my thing, but I can appreciate that this is a well made film that breathes life into a franchise that was suffering.",Jurassic World
324,hoernkeem,"Jurassic World (2015, Colin Trevorrow) Great special effects can't disguise a derivative plot and silly script",5,2 March 2021,"Jurassic World (2015, Colin Trevorrow)
There seems to be genuine excitement surrounding this dino sized reboot of the Jurassic Park series and people seem to be exiting fairly pleased. I'm not exactly sure why because this is just a big, bright, shiny object that doesn't stray far from any kind of basic narrative and when you lay back and digest it really is just a glossy rehash of the original film. This iteration of Jurassic Park is always looking for bigger and better both with regards to the film as a real world entity and with the story as well, in an interesting parallel, as if the filmmakers thought we can't just show them dinosaurs anymore we need larger, scarier dinosaurs with more spectacle which is exactly how the characters in the film run their theme park to their ultimate detriment. The original vision from 'Jurassic Park' has been realized and there is a park that is wildly popular however as dinosaur malaise sets in the money people behind the park quickly realize that as ""new"" and more impressive dinosaurs are unveiled attendance and dollars spike and thus begins this game of attempting to one up the last biggest and baddest creation. This leads to cross species genetic engineering and the Indominus Rex which is a nasty, large, violent, smart hybrid which unsurprisingly breaks out of containment and wacky hijinks ensue. You know; running, screaming and the chomping of human popcorn as the dinosaur goes on a rampage. Chris Pratt comes in as the archetype good guy on the side of the dinosaurs and against the evil empire creating new dinosaurs, or at least he seems to be the one person smart enough to know better and see the eventual outcome. Then there is evil corporation who is so blinded that they literally don't realize anything could possibly be wrong until it all goes horribly wrong. This is embodied by Bryce Dallas Howard's head of park operations. She gamely steps up as she realizes the error of her ways mainly because her nephews are conveniently lost and in peril. She is so amazing she can even outrun a T-Rex in heels and receive nary a scratch... Now that's talent! And Pratt's whole dino whisperer thing just had me rolling my eyes. My suspension of disbelief is pretty large but building a camaraderie with velociraptors to the point where one of them shares a tender moment with Pratt near the end had me cringing. There was mild entertainment here but for the most part all that entertainment stems from a template that was almost exactly copied from the original film. 'Jurassic World' may trump 'Jurassic Park' in scale but as for depth and sheer ground breaking spectacle it can't even compete.

325,zacpetch,The franchise needed rebooting and this does that with style!,8,14 June 2015,"After JPIII was a bit, shall we say, rubbish this franchise had been dead. But not anymore! Wisely choosing to not ignore the previous two sequels it instead just glosses over them and follows on the first by setting the action back on the first island and not even giving Site B a passing mention.Set in real time after the original we learn that John Hammond's dream of a Jurassic Themepark has been realised in the form of Jurassic World on Isla Nublar where it turns out people are not interested so the geneticists create a new monster. Bigger, scarier, more teeth. Meta-reference, methinks, to the fact this movie even exists. It wouldn't be a JP movie if it didn't go wrong and suffice to say that when it does, despite the lack of shock value, it will still get the adrenaline pumping.The dinosaurs are better looking this time round, ideal since there's more of them, and the cast has a much needed overhaul. Chris Pratt leads as a man who can command Velociraptors with Bryce Dallas Howard as the park secretary. Both do great. The two kids, not so much, but they're less irritating the any kids seen in the previous trilogy. Not that that's saying much!There's one scene that'll stick with you most of all which is the bit with the Pterodactyl and the Moasaur as they both eat the same person but otherwise the deaths are less memorable despite the higher body count. It's sad when some of the raptors get offed as well.In all this movie comes up best of the three sequels and second best overall. Definitely worth a watch. 4*s out of five. And it leaves the door open for a fifth instalment as well so that's good.",Jurassic World
326,freshclean-66-318608,Not As Good As The Original But Still One Of The Best.,7,9 October 2016,"""Jurassic World"" was not spectacular at all but it was still good. One thing I liked about this film was the references or what I thought were references that were portrayed throughout it. This made the film a little more interesting and fun to watch. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct this film, to me it still proved to be one of the best along with the first of the series so I can only image how good it would have been if Steven Spielberg did direct it and I'm not just saying that just because Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite director/producers in the industry. I've read a few reviews saying that this film was better than the first. In my opinion it wasn't but it is good enough to stand on its own and be a good film to remember. Colin Trevorrow did do a good job in directing this film but he wasn't a Steven Spielberg. This film is loaded with action that will keep its viewer at the edge of their seat. The performances in this film were good as well. This along with the thrilling action and great visual effects made it a perfect popcorn fest. I have to admit, I wasn't too interested in seeing this film when it came out and when it got DVD but I eventually rented it, and with no regrets. Like I said before, it's nothing spectacular but it is good. You won't be disappointed.",Jurassic World
327,palavitsinis,"When you're a fan, it really doesn't matter. But...",7,25 June 2015,"Well, to be honest, I just decided to go and see the movie more or less for the memories. I was merely 10 years old when the first one came out and by the time Jurassic Park III was out, I was eighteen. At age 32, I wanted to see whether or not I would be as impressed. I just watched it yesterday and then sat down on the computer and searched for the trailers of the old ones. I expected them to be too obvious and far fetched and ""in the past"". No. It was the other way around. I am now looking forward to seeing the old ones again. I do!The Jurassic World was OK. But when you're a fiction fanatic, you don't aim for ""OK"". You aim for f*** awesome! Well, that's not the one if you aiming that high. The acting was mediocre. I did not like Chris Pratt. I think that the character depicted by Sam Neil was much more appealing in this context. I don't think the movie needed a pumped up macho guy that is a dinosaur-lover and a commando. Bryce Dallas Howard was awesome as she is Jurassic material, following in the footsteps of the previous women in the series. I liked her overall as I liked the eccentric billionaire. On the other hand, Vincent D'Onofrio was too weak and did not manage to showcase a really bad guy. Failed to be exact. The cast was overall too weak. When in the previous ones you had Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore, there's nothing more to be said. I also did not like some of the scenes where the protagonists just look in the horizon and the camera just shows their face. It was too anachronistic and weird. In general, directing and what else, was not of the known standards. You saw the huge dinosaur walking next to Chris Pratt, with I don't know how many tons, and the ground did not even move a bit. I missed the effect with the water in the glasses or on the ground, rippling from the steps of a dinosaur. These things are done already but they are also the crown jewels of this trilogy. Don't leave them out! Or the tapping of the claw of the velociraptor on the kitchen floor... In other scenes, you saw the actors walking around fighting dinosaurs, like any human in their right mind would walk between the feet of a T-Rex! And weirdly enough, manage to escape as they did. And then, when there's no original thought, you see the sea creature just jumping out of the water, eating the big enemy. Too convenient, too easy, too predictable. Fight scenes needed some wider angles so that the viewer could get the entire fight. They also needed some better directing and positioning of the actors. That's mainly the reason why we pay the ticket. Make it worth, please! I will now look for the bundle of the first three movies in a DVD and sit down and watch them. This one really made me appreciate the old ones more. At least, the promise of a sequel to this one was something to hope for. And I would LOVE to see J.K. Simmons in it!",Jurassic World
328,eyeintrees,Trash. A waste of everything that a movie should actually be.,1,21 October 2015,"Much like Jurassic World, this load of junk was created purely to rake in the dollar.Apparently it's OK to show the world... AGAIN... live goats waiting to be eaten, pigs going to be ripped to shreds by teams of raptors and people being torn to pieces, but when a dino dies the violins begin and the female lead trots around a dinosaur paddock in 6 inch heels and a cream suit, suitably panting and puffing, chest rising, falling, splayed on the ground, all vulnerable and waiting... I was wishing so hard that the Rex would eat her... it might have saved the entire load of nonsense.The usual totally stupid script, but at least the first movie was original, the second annoying and the third intriguing... this movie is just terrible repeat, repeat, repeat... gosh, even down to a cell phone incident... wow... not a single original moment, the usual interchangeable Hollywood actors that I'll never remember and loads and loads of stupidity and artifice. Garbage. The one redeeming feature is for about 5 seconds you get to see astoundingly beautiful nature. First time I've loathed Vincent D'Onofrio and I never thought I'd say that. The other actors could have been pulled straight out of Days of our Lives, complete with faces that did not move a muscle, even when in a state of supposed terror. Who willingly makes this kind of utter trash? I hope this is the last one. Leave the dino's where they belong, in the past!Totally forgettable and moronic waste of time.

329,craig-hopton,Basically a remake of Jurassic Park; but a good one!,8,29 December 2015,"This is basically a remake of the original Jurassic Park movie. It follows the same concept of kids, staying with their relatives, trapped in a theme park with dinosaurs on the loose. It just does it with more dinosaurs than before (adding swimming and flying dinosaurs to the mix) and bigger dinosaurs than before (a genetically-enhanced killer).It even plays tongue-in-cheek homage to that original movie by reusing a number of visual cues (DNA man, the jeeps, flare to attract the T-Rex). And the mix of characters is basically the same too - corporate greed types, scientists that overreach themselves, the guy who 'understands' dinosaurs, the well-meaning but naive owner.So how did it stack up?Well it is clearly not as good (not as new, not as involving, not even as tense) as the original Jurassic Park. But it surprised me how much I did enjoy Jurassic World. By sticking to the original formula they were using some thing that worked - and it had me hooked from start to finish. There's a good tension and threat level throughout. The scary dinosaur scenes just keep on coming, from velociraptor chases, to pterosaur flocks, to dinosaur-on- dinosaur fights. And people just keep on getting eaten, one after another!Others have said that the heavy use of CGI was a problem. I disagree. I found all the dinosaurs to be incredibly lifelike.The acting is (while not poor) not going to win any Oscars. It was a relatively unknown cast and could have benefited from a couple of top actors to bring more gravitas.But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

330,magnuslhad,Termiraptor,4,24 March 2016,"CGI has hardly moved on since the first Jurassic Park movie, so in order to evoke a 'Wow!' factor the latest iteration of the franchise has to rely on narrative innovations instead. What they come up with is a genetically modified killing machine that crosses raptors with T-Rex, and a herd of raptors trained to take orders - kind of - that have the potential for militarization. Yes, it is as lame as it sounds. My pre-teen son was bored, so it fails the litmus test right there. At one point the main character says ""Do you listen to yourself when you speak?"" It's a cute moment of pastiche, but the line could basically be applied to 70 percent of the dialogue in this film. Two vanilla boys are the dinosaur bait this time, mashed up with some spurious worries about parental divorce, an irresponsible aunt, and an Indy Jones wannabe dinosaur trainer who is some kind of mixed up eco-warrior. Probably. The baddie is so cardboard and pantomime he should be wearing a cloak and mask. And there is a hipster in the control room who may be Jeff Goldblum's illegitimate offspring, but clearly got his humour gene from his mother. Bland, tonally uneven, with unengaging characters.

331,lois-lane33,Another calculated cash grab at the wallets of parents with young teens.,4,9 July 2015,I suppose this film wasn't intended for people over eighteen. I think there are too many movies aimed at younger audiences being made these days-it seems like just about everything that has come out this year with one or two exceptions were films for thirteen year old types. Films that really have nothing to offer anyone who actually went to College. I'm all for a good adventure-in fact its what I like to watch the most in movies but I wasn't impressed with anything other than the film looked like it cost a fortune to produce. I was more amazed by the amount of money they probably had to spend to achieve the desired effect of creating a movie that looked like it cost a fortune to make. I don't think thats the same thing as an adventure. The plot line was virtually non-existent being merely a 'next step down the greed ladder' for the pseudo corporation that created the Jurassic theme park in the first place. The idea of using DNA trapped in amber is real science but I didn't get a sense that this movie would necessarily appeal to younger people with an interest in science. It was the kind of thing that Disney did a lot of-suggest science in a movie but don't actually talk about any specifics. ROOOAAR goes the big Dinosaur. OOOOOH goes the audience (supposedly). I doubt they were too many OOOH's and AAAH's for this movie-I think it probably got the ho-hum reaction it deserved from the thirteen year old audience it was targeting. Dinosaurs.

333,justinwfirestone,No suspense,4,11 July 2015,"Jurassic World is not bad, is not good. It's binary fine: one bit this way, one bit that way. The ""world"" is, and exists only because some well-off humans can afford to blow some dispensable income on travelling to an island for a few days to gawk at the amazingness that is an unethical use of science.The movie is superficially pro-science, giving evolution its second 15 minutes of fame. We can create fantastical entertainment, but it might also kill us. Modern problems sure are two-edged swords!We have a throwaway plot, that profit is king, and privilege is best when you are on an island full of over 20,000 people trying to outlive a gaggle of pterodactyls. And let me put on my ""old man"" hat to say the movie is unnecessarily cruel and sadistic, with the British assistant suffering a worse death than anything from the Final Destiny movies, to the bitey-biteyness of all the bloody dino fights.Sad, sad, sad, we must feel at the pointless murder of all the happy-go-lucky, vegetarian, apatosauruses, who in reality are nothing but a stream of ones and zeroes. The cruel world spawned by an Asian biologist and an Arabic boss-man-owner is just an island of corporate greed, floating on each scene's profit models, only to have the Pretty White People swoop in and save most of the visitors. Never mind the Tyrannosaurus Rex nor the countless pterodactyls running amok and wantonly. It's an adventure of privilege, a privileged adventure.Star Lord reprises his iconic role as Butt Lord, the only man in the world who can relate to lizards because he's the only one who treats them with respect and treats them like they're real animals. Plus, he was also in the Navy (and is not a Navajo), so he really knows how to stroke a lizard.What's a villain? Who's a bad person? Corporate greed and its devotees. Everyone bad dies savagely, and no one good suffers too much. That's why we all need to make Good Life Choices. We should never play God with life, that's pushing it too far, and none of this mess would have been possible without evil scientists' desires to control and improve upon God's design.Instead, we should commodify the human spirit, body, and soul. We should make everyone desire the same things, so we can maximize profit by reducing the cost of producing or tolerating variety. Watch as a fine-tuned machine mechanically separates chickens. With time and a spirit of the will, someday a machine will mechanically separate people.Near the midpoint, the Pretty White People find an overgrown, old Jurassic Park spot, a reminder of the first movie, a movie that was better in nearly every way. It no longer matters whether the CGI looks or feels real. You simply watch in awe that professional actors could ever deliver such crappy dialogue without laughing or wincing.",Jurassic World
334,JPfanatic93,Another fun walk in the park!,8,10 October 2015,"A life changing experience after an anxious 14 year wait? That's saying a little too much. A worthy successor to the first trilogy? Sure was. Not on par with the original Jurassic Park film of course, but whoever expected that knew they were deceiving themselves. It was obvious from the get-go they would never rival the magic of that game changing film that revolutionized digital effects. In fact, there's plenty of those throughout the movie, but they are never as awe inspiring or jaw dropping as they were 22 years ago. To be honest, I would actually have preferred a more extensive use of animatronics, since a lot of people tend to forget JP proved to master their use to great effect specifically in combination with the digital aspect, both of them completing the other in bringing that dinomite magic about rather than fixing it on their own accord. JW opted for a 95 percent digital FX rate and it was a little too clear at times, but not so much it took you out of the movie. It's still a major Hollywood blockbuster with a huge budget after all.And it sure felt as one of those. In both a positive and a negative way. It didn't leave much room for narrative surprises, and the third act was largely an exercise in predictable storytelling, but it still handled it in such an epic way you could not help but roll with it despite your hesitations. There's a few instances in which the audience cheered and so did I, as if we were eight year old kids again (the increasingly strict Dutch rating system unfortunately won't allow kids of that age to experience the new Jurassic dawn, as JW has sadly been issued a '12' rating, despite not being more frightful than that first movie). Kids who had seen most of this stuff before in different guises though, but youthful exuberance abounded nonetheless. A contemporary blockbuster needs a star, and Chris Pratt is it for this film. Combining Alan Grant's common sense with Ian Malcolm's wit and wisecracking, the human hero of the piece certainly felt more heroic that any previous main human character in a JP movie. I don't mind for once, but I do hope the studio isn't gonna craft the next installments, unavoidable considering box office records are again being stamped on, around Pratt's persona and status, since few will deny the true stars are still the dinosaurs, as they should be.Those stars sure got a chance to shine, as JW provided the most amount of dinosaur time of any of the movies yet. The number of species portrayed easily rivals that of its predecessors, even giving the occasional formerly neglected species (like Ankylosaurus) their due. The most attention as always is directed at the carnivores, with JW dividing most of their screen time between a trained foursome of vicious but communicable Velociraptors and a genetic hybrid named Indominus Rex. Both the notion of taming Raptors and of creating mix-up dinosaurs is handled by director Colin Trevorrow with enough narrative and real world sense not to distance the legions of JP fanatics, as it easily could have done. Ample time is cleared to discuss the ramifications of both with more depth than is usual for a blockbuster film, before diving deeply into the dino fighting. That said, there's two prehistoric characters that are not featured as strongly as we would have hoped for, one being the iconic T-Rex which is intentionally kept out of most of the loop before making a most welcome resurgence. The other is the heavily advertised aquatic Mosasaurus, which unfortunately is allotted only a few more seconds of screen time than already seen in the promotional material, and thus ending up an underwhelming animal we would liked to have seen a lot more of, but which we are sadly denied.Executive producer Spielberg made the right choice hiring a fairly inexperienced director like Trevorrow for the Jurassic job. Trevorrow proves not only respective of the material and the franchise legacy, but he's clearly a JP fan himself. He shows it off in many scenes, both in composition of shots, score and sounds, but also in many references big and small to that most beloved movie from 22 years past. Potentially polarizing plot pitfalls are handled with the utmost care to make them plausible and relatable, thus adding his own signature to the thankfully enduring Jurassic Park legacy. Though there's still a few things to hold against the movie, both in terms of plot (one-dimensional human bad guy, vague corporate shenanigans) as in execution (too little animatronics, too much reliance on digital creations), Jurassic World succeeds in taking us back to when dinosaurs ruled the Earth, and sparing no expense in guaranteeing they will continue to do so for another generation at least.",Jurassic World

Thank you for uninspiringly and atrociously murdering an already quality declining franchise that land-marked my childhood. Jurassic World went through development hell, a roulette of screenwriters and directors that at one point or another were deemed unfit or felt the story needed betterment.

336,FilmMuscle,Lighten Up and Enjoy the Return of Cool Dinosaurs,8,14 June 2015,"One of the most fascinating thematic aspects of the Jurassic Park franchise has always been its exploration of man vs. nature–about man's delusions in actually believing they can control nature for the sake of (artificial) progress. How can we turn any natural facet to our own advantage–for war, for food, for simple amusement? The latest entry in the series, Jurassic World, has finally arrived after fourteen years of dinosaur-less cinema, and I'm proud to say that it's distinct enough from its predecessors. It chooses to go even deeper into the idea of not only genetically creating dinosaurs, but also genetically modifying them to the point where we begin to see hybrids of two different species.Following the severe mishap that was Jurassic Park because of–again– man's delusions (in that case, good-intentioned but seriously mistaken John Hammond), a new theme park has been built on the same island of Isla Nublar that seems to be working just fine and accepting thousands and thousands of visitors. It's Disney World except with dinosaurs–my god, how cool would that be? Aquariums, vast dinosaur-populated plains for touring, and other fun rides make up the majority of what this magical place has to offer. Of course, with such an ambitious idea, something terrible is always bound to transpire at one point or another. Suddenly, the boundaries we thought could easily keep humans safe from those spine-chilling carnivores are somehow demolished, and in comes chaos.This time around, instead of series favorites like Sam Neill as Dr. Grant or Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, we have 2014-born-movie-star Chris Pratt in the lead role as a muscular Velociraptor expert/trainer with the return of Bryce Dallas Howard as well (seriously, what happened to her? I thought The Help and Spider-Man 3 were financially successful). The two charismatic actors are surrounded by astounding production design and dazzling visual effects. You can whine about the pervasiveness of CGI all you want, but I've revisited the first film– Jurassic Park–a few days ago. Aside from the T-Rex, let's just say that those dinosaurs haven't been exactly aging well. In this film, I thought all of them looked completely believable and impressively- conceived; so I'm not complaining for the next few years (we'll see how it looks two decades down the road), especially when you get some amazing dino-versus-dino sequences. I won't spoil anything, but I'm sure you've always dreamed of seeing your favorite dinosaur species fiercely fighting it out and ripping each other to shreds with one's strength and the other's speed and calculation.Unlike The Lost World where the first half honestly bored me to a point where I was crazily yearning for some dinosaurs to finally pop up on- screen, Jurassic World presents you with such an immaculately-designed amusement park, using its two adolescent characters {13-year-old Gray (Ty Simpkins) and 20-year-old Zach (Nick Robinson)} to navigate through the various spellbinding museums and park tours while intercutting with the scientific/corporate storyline that shows us what's really going on behind all that awe and wonder. You're entertained from the get-go, and the long build-up to the appearance of the first killer dinosaur only excites you that much more.Now, the highest points of the series have always come in those times of real suspense and fright. That's precisely why I enjoyed Jurassic Park III a lot more than everyone else; almost everything in that forest was incredibly menacing and every step the characters took in whatever direction might've been their very last. I loved that dark, horror element. Unfortunately, save for one very particular end to a character, the deaths here are hardly creative and impactful. Very little blood and gore is shown in comparison to the last two movies (which were rated PG-13 too), and there's nothing that can show the sheer danger of an approaching carnivore more than the amount of damage it inflicts on human flesh. No, the villains are killed off rather quickly, and most of the major characters with a given name make it through alive. In sum, Jurassic World is definitely one of the lightest and most humorous entries in the franchise for better or worse. It's undoubtedly a lot of fun even when the situations turn to obvious implausibility.For future reference though, please, filmmakers–just please–stop this trend of self-awareness. Your movie isn't magically better and cooler just because you make some subtle remark about how you're a sequel/remake in today's heavily corporate Hollywood. ""Get it, guys? We're on the same page!"" No, just stop Jurassic World does as much as it can to get all of those original fans back with pleasure; every moment seems to be carefully guiding itself along without upsetting and offending the viewers with unexpected, outlandish dinosaur segments like the ""Alan!"" dream in Jurassic Park III or the T-Rex's King Kong-style rampage across San Diego in The Lost World. Of course, I just know that as I say this, some hardcore nitpickers, who have no sense of what lightening up and purely enjoying blockbuster entertainment means, will be ripping this film apart as well. I guess some people will have to get used to the fact that future sequels will never capture the magic in seeing dinosaurs on the big screen for the first time like the original did. That can only be accomplished once. Duh! Anyway, I fully commend the series for constantly reinventing and keeping each entry unique from the others.",Jurassic World
337,lucasversantvoort,"Decent and fun, but not the sequel we've been waiting for",6,21 June 2015,"After a decade of preproduction, the fourth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise was finally released. The question on everyone's mind was whether it would succeed in recapturing what Jurassic Park brought to the table. It's an admirable attempt, but alas, not everything's as it should be.As the title suggests, Jurassic Park has been transformed into Jurassic World, a theme park for the whole family, by the InGen company. Think Disneyland, but with dinosaurs. You've got two brothers Zach and Gray who're sent there to have fun under the supervision of their aunt Claire, the park's manager. Right away you can tell she's all about her job, because she's the kind of character who looks at her watch and says ""three minutes late"" Meanwhile the park's owner, Masrani, tells Claire to bring in a specialist to inspect the enclosure for the Indominus Rex (the 'iRex' if you will), the latest genetically modified dinosaur. This specialist is velociraptor trainer Owen Grady who, when he's not training his raptors, likes to spend his time dishing out one-liners like it's going out of style. Then you've got Hoskins, InGen's chief of security, who tries to persuade Owen to let his raptors be used for military purposes. When Owen inspects the enclosure, they find evidence the iRex probably climbed over the walls and escaped. Soon, and not altogether unexpectedly, things escalate, resulting in a film of extraordinary tension and excitementnot really though. It's not, as Jeff Goldblum would say, ""one big pile of sh*t"", but to be honest, I thought things on the action side of things were a bit lackluster and not because it was badly choreographed or anything like that. Quite frankly, the insistence on CGI and 3D ruined a lot of the tension. It's kind of like upscaling, it doesn't increase immersion or realism, it just enhances the flaws of the image and in this case the visual effects. Watching Jurassic World, I have doubts as to whether (and where) animatronics were used, even though the many close-ups allowed the filmmakers the opportunity to do so. It feels like you're constantly watching these dinosaurs that look just a bit too blurry. Even the introduction of the park itself is lackluster. You've got the impressive aerial shots and so on, but it just doesn't feel real.On the other hand, Jurassic World does fit quite well into the storyline as a whole. It does manage to capture the spirit of it at least somewhat. There are all kinds of references to Jurassic Park and the storyline provides its own spin on the familiar tropes, which is more than I can say for Jurassic Park III. I like the idea of the theme park, the fact that visitors have gotten bored with 'regular' dinosaurs (hence InGen creates the Indominus Rex to meet consumer demand), the psychological angle of having Owen be the alpha to the raptors, etc.There are plenty of ideas here, some better executed than others. For instance, while Owen being able to somewhat control the raptors is an interesting new idea, it also makes the raptors less threatening. Compare that to Jurassic Park where they were the most terrifying thing to occupy the screen, despite being way smaller than the T-Rex. No doubt the infamous kitchen scene wouldn't have become such a classic if there was a character who could get the raptors to stand down. Some of the characterization also doesn't quite work: when you discover that Claire and Owen used to date, you just know they'll end up together by the film's end. Also, Hoskins is quite underwhelming as a villain. He's so obsessed with using raptors for military purposes, I'm just waiting for him to say, ""Think of the military applications!""All this complaining aside, there've been way worse sequels than Jurassic World, especially when you consider this is the fourth entry. It's generally fun to watch and builds on the ideas of the original in its own way. No doubt, more sequels are inbound. Meanwhile, I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope we'll see more animatronics in the future and that the action will feel more grounded.",Jurassic World
338,tinovalkki,Great back to Jurassic...,9,13 June 2015,"Dinosaur park is open and very magnificently way. Jurassic World is the best thing for this series since it's original opening back in 1993. The way they bring digital dinosaurs to big screen with true actors is simply amazing. Script may not be the smartest it it has depth enough. Chris Pratt is great choice to be a hero and Bryce Dallas Howard is brilliant as cold business woman. Even the child actors are no embarrassed this time. Even the story is quite similar with original Jurassic Park it is clearly sequel than reboot because it's hints to previous movies. The script may be quite light but it has few well written depths in the story that it keeps it entertaining and even touching. Final battle scene is quite effect rumble with all the dinosaur fighting, but end scene of the movie is almost too sweet. At once 3D works well at the movie and camera ride feels like wild roller coaster ride. Steven Spielberg has made a good choice to stay as a producer and Colin Trevorrow do good job as a director. Fine and entertaining summer block buster which leaves you to wait more to come. First weekend box office is so persuasive that it would be a miracle if this would be the last visit in park. I'm looking forward to see more visits to Jurassic World. It almost make me to hope it would be real theme park somewhere south pacific. Very good return to Jurassic Park.",Jurassic World

340,jaredpahl,"Spielberg Magic, This Is Not. Still, a Visit to Jurassic World Is Worth the Price of Admission.",7,12 June 2018,"You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as ""The best Jurassic Park sequel"", some fans declare that it ""brought them back to their childhood"", and others who may have made the absurd claim, ""It's better than the original"". Don't believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg's own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn't hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. That being said, in a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood ""event"" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Let's just not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg's magic touch is still sorely missed.Jurassic World is the latest film in the Jurassic Park franchise in name only. Call it a sequel, reboot, or re-quel, the fact remains, this is not the same world created by author Michael Crichton and made real by Spielberg and company in 1993. All the major characters from the first three films are gone. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the appealing and memorable characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad movie archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. With respect to our new kid characters and Vincent D'Onofrio's bone-headed military grunt, the only two characters worth noting in Jurassic World are Owen Grady, a rugged dino-expert played by bona fide movie star Chris Pratt, and Claire Dearing, an uptight scientist played by Bryce Dallas-Howard. Both are really likable in doses, and the script doesn't subject us to too much of their dopey bantering. While Owen and Claire are cliched, and ultimately uninteresting, as characters, the charm and sheer star power of Pratt and Dallas-Howard are quite enough to bolster JW's brand of disposable summer adventuring.There's a neat little hook to the story of Jurassic World. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond's dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is opened and fully operating. However, when the public begins to lose interest in seeing the same old dinosaurs, the scientists of Jurassic World are prompted to create an all-new hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Well, you guessed it, that dinosaur escapes. Okay, so that's a clever solution to the classic Jurassic Park sequel dilemma, ""How does this stuff keep happening?"", but that plot line takes all of twenty minutes to peter into a chase picture, and a simple one at that. The few subplots are banal. Be it, two brothers who come to Jurassic World to spend time with their aunt, or a ridiculous plan to weaponize velociraptors (The latter of those subplots is one of the most embarrassingly stupid ideas I've seen in a movie in years), Jurassic World doesn't have much to get invested in besides big scary monsters running after people.There is one aspect of the film that I love, and that is the design of the Jurassic World Resort. The care that went into perfecting the look of the theme park is a great deal higher than the care that went into the story or the filmmaking. Jurassic World is a living, breathing place, and it is filled with all kinds of minor details that help sell the illusion. The triceratops petting zoo, the hamster ball ride, the souvenir shops, and scores of other theme park related details are touches that I was grateful made it into the film. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was ""intended"". The immersion lasts throughout, even as the prehistoric psycho-killer, and all the destruction that it brings, takes center stage. Once the Indominus Rex gets out, and all Hell breaks loose, director Colin Trevorrow's filmmaking starts to show its deficiencies. Jurassic World is an impressive technical feat. The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. It all looks like a million bucks (or 150 million to be exact), and it's all very fun, but when it comes to the meat of the movie, it's foolish to think that Jurassic World is anything more than Transformers with dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Steven Spielberg infused his action scenes with tension and suspense. There was a certain kind of visual poetry to the T-Rex attack in the first movie or the raptors in the grass scene from The Lost World. They were exhilarating because of their selective restraint. Without showing everything, Spielberg made scenes that were subtle and scary, and that exploded to life at just the right moments. Jurassic World's action scenes are big, loud, and entertaining, but it's all chaos, no technique. Trevorrow throws the kitchen sink into every shot. The Indominus Rex chomps up dozens of machine gun toting mercenaries, pterodactyls dart all over the screen pecking and biting everything in sight, and big, lumbering CGI beasts fight each other and destroy every last peanut brittle building around them. Sound familiar? It's the kind of Call of Duty-esque sensory bombardment that can be loads of fun to watch while you're there but doesn't leave the lasting impact of truly great action.So it is with Jurassic World. The movie is big, bright, and fun, with lots of action and good special effects. It pleases crowds. But as with most big budget crowd pleasers, it comes with dull characters, brain dead plotting and booming CGI overload. Jurassic World left me with the exact same feeling I got after seeing Jurassic Park 3. Both movies are serviceable summer romps, full of dino-action and great visual effects, but there is simply a noticeable dip in the quality of the production. Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B-caliber FX spectacular. For dumb summer fun, it works. But there was a time when Jurassic Park aspired to more than dumb summer fun. Steven Spielberg's first two movies had class. They grappled with ideas, they were intelligent, they showcased real filmmaking, and they were genuinely thrilling. Jurassic World is colorful and entertaining, but let's be clear, when it's all said and done, nothing beats Spielberg. 74/100",Jurassic World
341,troy-daniel-bush,I mean... it's better than Number 3 and Fallen Kingdom,3,1 November 2021,"It has some enjoyable stuff but all of that only holds up so much when the movie fails miserably in terms of acting, writing, effects, tension, creativity, and satisfying violence.Due to the fact that I am an animal lover, I like the park itself. That one really brief scene with the kids playing with the baby dinosaurs was cute to me. Then once I considered that some kids are monsters and might be stupid enough to make one of the dinosaurs angry, I realized it was a terrible idea.The I-Rex can do some, admittedly, cool stuff. Like sense body heat and camouflage itself. I also like the fact it can grab people with its hands and that it's hands have long claws.Chris Pratt is cool but his charisma only takes his character so far.The score is great but that credit should for the most part go to the original film.The actors are well-cast.Even if it's superficial, I have fun watching people get attacked and eaten by dinosaurs.And I like looking at Bryce Dallas Howard. I'm a guy and she's beautiful. Sue me.However...
The plot is inorganic and predictable.The characters are annoying and stupid.Most of the acting is terrible.The product placement is ridiculous to the point of being unforgivable.The fan service was so prevalent and poorly used that I wondered if Colin Trevorrow was a pseudonym of JJ Abrams.The CGI is terrible. Whether it was a dinosaur or a building it looked so fake. They looked fake even when this movie came out. And there were moments where they totally could've used animatronics or puppets but didn't. There's one instance of a practical dinosaur and surprise surprise it looked a billion times better than any other dinosaur in the whole movie. The two scenes where the squad of raptors have their heads in these ... I don't know what they're called and the CGI heads looked god-awful. And yes, they looked god-awful when this movie came out. When those scenes came on all I could think to myself was, ""Why didn't you use animatronics?! It would've been so much more convincing! You could've gotten the desired expressions and everything!""The attempts at humor fall flat on their face and break their nose and spew blood all over the place.The park shouldn't exist. You're intelligent scientists who learned nothing from Malcolm and the first incident!Making a hybrid dinosaur? Again, you're intelligent scientists and it didn't occur to you that that might be a terrible idea?!The original movie was not devoid of cheesy stuff but unlike with that film, the cheesiness in this movie is unforgivable.Controlling raptors? No!Raptor and Rex have an understanding? No!Running in high heels from a Rex that the first film stated can run at 30miles an hour? No!Raptors being cute? That's stupid!How did the I-Rex know it was being monitored by thermal technology?The violence was nerfed.The dialogue was wince-worthy. And how many times was the word ""animals"" used?Owen loves animals yet he feeds whole dead animals to his raptors and uses live animals for training?You cannot use dinosaurs in war! The Nazis tried to use dolphins as suicide bombers and it failed. ""I wonder why."" (And these hack writers doubled down on this for the sequel and tried to justify it. Guess what? They failed miserably. Shocking, I know.)You care about the kids in the first two movies but in this one, Fallen Kingdom, and Battle of Big Rock you want them to get eaten alive.Why was there a divorce subplot?Why did there have to be kids at all?There's more things I could list but I'm gonna end this review here because I want to.",Jurassic World

343,postsenthil,"A MUST WATCH !! (preferably, in IMAX 3D, if you can !!)",9,27 October 2019,"Jurassic World directed by Colin Trevorrow is officially the fourth installment of the famous dino franchise that started in 1993 by the master auteur Steven Spielberg who had, in turn, adopted it from the best selling novel of sci-fi author Michael Chrichton. When Spielberg presented his pioneering movie, as an adventure 65 million years in the making, it proved to be a defining moment in movie history - an early triumph of movie magic concocted from CGI and animatronics wizardry - which redefined the possibilities and consequently, the paradigm of popular cinema. It left a firm imprint (a la T-Rex's footprint) on the minds of its viewers like me with its vivid imagery - be it the tiny ripples in the water accompanied by the thuds of the approaching creature, the chilling chase sequence of T Rex hounding a speeding jeep, the nail biter of a pantry sequence involving the two kids and a bunch of raptors as well as the sequence where kids trapped in the car are confronted by the mighty T Rex in a rampaging mode.However, as with most such mega movies, the franchise soon became a victim of its own momentous success. Dino movies, just like their dinosaurs, soon got relegated to a prehistoric era in the minds of the movie goers as subsequent summer blockbusters have continued to grow and hone their CGI wizardry to create bigger, meaner and scarier monsters which pile up the scale of mayhem with each passing year. However, the enduring value of the original movie was reinforced when Universal Studios released the reworked 3D version of Jurassic Park in 2013 to mark the twentieth anniversary of its release which proved successful across the globe.The present movie is set in Isla Nublar after 22 years from the timeline of the the first movie and ignores the story arcs of its sub-par sequels (1994 by Spielberg and 2001 by Joe Johnston). John Hammond's dream is finally a reality with his successor Mesrani (Irrfan Khan) having set up a hugely popular, luxury dino theme park called Jurassic World spanning the entire island of Isla Nublar. The park is headed by a control seeking, very formal - ""I am all business"" - park manager, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard). Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is an ex-navy officer-cum-animal expert, working in the park and is involved in a study on training velociraptors. As the movie opens, Claire is forced to play host to her school going nephews, Zach and Gray, who are sent by their parents for a fun weekend while they consider an impending divorce.The park itself has been a successful venture for several years now with steady growth of visitors from across the world. The influx of the visitors is spiked periodically by introducing a new species every few years to sustain the waning interests. The tourists' fatigue of older attractions is succinctly captured in a sequence where Zach, in his observatory, prefers to remain glued to his smart phone and ignores a T-Rex (no less), quite literally, devouring a scapegoat (a key element in the first movie). So, when mother nature is incapable of dishing out attractions that could sustain such volatile attention spans, the corporation running Jurassic World decides to take matters in its own hands to bolster the sagging growth curve of footfalls in the park. They cook up a new dino attraction - read bigger, louder, smarter dinosaur with more teeth - called Indominus rex, by concocting a genetic cocktail of DNA sourced from multiple dinosaurs and other species. Predictably, as dictated by the template of such genre movies, the dino escapes its confinement to go on a killing frenzy, unleashing mayhem on the unsuspecting tourists as well as other dinosaurs.
Off the cast, Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) continues to charm with his performance and one gets a feeling that he might well be the right guy for an Indiana Jones reboot. He shares an interesting chemistry with Howard who is competent and brings in the necessary intensity in the second half. The rest of the cast including Irrfan and the two kids are merely for functional aspects - to stage an action sequence, mouth something vaguely philosophical or become feast for the predators - with limited scope to perform as is the norm in such monster movies.Director Colin Trevorrow who had impressed with his indie time travel comedy, Safety Not Guaranteed, on his debut, is filling some VERY BIG shoes for his second feature and has managed to ace his first try at the summer blockbuster genre. Trevorrow's execution manifests his brilliance in marshaling the resources at hand to craft a sure-fire winner that packs in the right dose of spectacle to shock and awe the viewers. He stages the action sequences with commendable clarity and fluid camera work which herald him as a maker who is confident of his craft and can leave his mark despite several imprints of Spielberg (Executive Producer here) that permeate the movie. Trevorrow also doffs his hat at Spielberg's original as well as earlier works more than once as in the case of using Mr. DNA animation, statue of Hammond, using the dilapidated site of the earlier park to stage an action sequence or even in the spectacular sequence of feeding a great white shark to an aquatic dinosaur (Mosasaurus).Besides being the big bang blockbuster, Trevorrow and his co-writers supplement the regular fare of faulting human hubris in playing God to include multiple elements of self-referencing all through the movie by flagging the never-ending saga of our times - the interplay of consumerism and capitalism wherein we, the consumers (even as audiences) are constantly seeking the next BIGGER, BETTER experience and the capitalists seeking to continuously stoke this innate, insatiable instincts of the consumer and milk the same for more and more moolah.On the flip side, the movie could be definitely held guilty for doing such self referencing a tad too much as well as for playing up the ancient gender archetypes, multitude of conspicuous product placements and some pretty hollow characterisations. Yet, it redeems itself by delivering solidly on its promise of bringing the scares through BIGGER, LOUDER & MORE TEETH which translates into popcorn munching fun, fear and wonderment. While clearly not surpassing Spielberg's original, Trevorrow's energetic movie is mighty successful in replicating much of the awe and is clearly a worthy successor that ups the benchmark of spectacle value for future movies which could well make it the biggest winner of this summer.",Jurassic World
344,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: An adventurous journey to the Spielbergian world of chaos and carnage,8,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World is a 2015 American sci-fi adventure film directed by Colin Trevorrow. The movie's screenplay is co-written by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Connolly, and Trevorrow himself. Jurassic World stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Irrfan Khan, Vincent D'Onofrio, B. D. Wong, Ty Simpkins, and Nick Robinson in major roles. The fourth installment in the Jurassic Park film series, Jurassic World is a direct sequel to the Steven Spielberg directed Hollywood blockbuster Jurassic Park(1993). The film is set twenty-two years after the disturbing turn of events at Isla Nublar--an island off the coast of Costa Rica--which had forced John Hammond (played by the great English thespian and filmmaker Richard Attenborough), the founder and CEO of bioengineering company InGen, to abandon the theme park he had so painstakingly populated with ingeniously cloned dinosaurs. It's been ten years since Hammond's vision of a dinosaur theme park finally became a reality. The new park is named as Jurassic World and is owned by the Indian business magnate and dinosaur enthusiast Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) who has not only nurtured Hammond's dream but has also taken it to a whole new level.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing Masrani's team of bioengineers, led by none other than the genius scientist Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong reprises his role), have made tremendous progress in their research and are now able to genetically splice the dinosaur DNA at will with that of various other species, giving rise to a hybrid breed of dinosaurs. Masrani sees it as good business as these new varieties of dinosaurs tremendously add to the attraction of the park and keep the visitor rates from declining. So far, so good, but, for how long can one continue to bend the rules of nature? Sooner or later, we must all pay the price for our greed! It's an eventuality that Masrani and men must be well prepared for. For, according to Murphy's law, ""anything that can go wrong, will go wrong"". Things finally go out of control when Dr. Wu and team come up with a T. Rex hybrid in a bid to fulfill a corporate mandate. Voila! We are transported back to the Spielbergian world of chaos and carnage as the theme park slowly takes the form of a ticking time bomb, ready to go kablooey at any given moment. In a race against time, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a Velociraptor expert and trainer, and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the operations manager of Jurassic World must set aside their past differences and join hands to stop the impending doom that awaits them all.Indian actor Irrfan Khan as Jurassic World owner Simon Masrani Jurassic World is everything it is supposed to be and more. Needless to say, there is action, adventure, fun and frolic, and loads of creepy dinosaur mayhem. As one would expect, Jurassic World employs cutting edge CGI and VFX and the excellent 3D effects make it an experience of a kind. There's no denying that these technical factors make it quite unique in comparison to its predecessors. While the movie fails to match the cinematic brilliance of Spielberg's epic dinosaur extravaganza, Jurassic World nonetheless manages to fulfill its promise of being a perfect Hollywood summer blockbuster. Late American film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Jurassic Park: ""The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. But consider what could have been. There is a scene very early in the film where Neill and Dern, who have studied dinosaurs all of their lives, see living ones for the first time. The creatures they see are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. And that is the sense lacking in the rest of the film, which quickly turns into a standard monster movie, with screaming victims fleeing from roaring dinosaurs."" Ebert was perhaps more interested in the possibility of a constructive interaction between the humans and the dinosaurs. It's good to see Jurassic World finally take a few steps in that directionâ""as evident from the scenes wherein Chris Pratt's character tries to train the Velociraptors.Owen Grady trains the Raptors in Jurassic World Overall, Jurassic World can best be described as a visual feast for action-adventure enthusiasts. But, the movie does offer some nice and punchy one- liners. Perhaps, the best ones get delivered by Simon Masrani, the most impactful being: ""The key to a happy life is to accept that one is never in control."" Then there is one delivered by Dr. Henry Wu: ""Monster is a relative word; to a canary, a cat is a monster... so far we humans were used to being cats."" Jurassic World in addition to being a high octane summer extravaganza also serves to be a relevant critique on growing consumerism and corporate excess and mocks the human desire for profit. While the theme part is a manifestation of the human desire, the T. Rex hybrid certainly represents its worst side. The acting performances in the movie range from average to good. While Irrfan Khan makes his presence felt in the limited screen time he gets, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard add a spark to the movie with their solid performances. The rest of the cast does a decent job of supporting them. Jurassic World is a highly entertaining piece of cinema that takes us on an adventurous journey to the long forgotten Spielbergian avenues of madness and confusion, thereby allowing us to relive our childhood memories. Highly recommended! (This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)",Jurassic World
345,domtaylor,"There's some entertainment to be had here, but overall it's just mediocre.",5,10 July 2018,"This long anticipated (for some reason) follow-up is pretty average, and shows that the once masterful 'Jurassic' franchise has become part of the Hollywood money-making machine. Perhaps it shouldn't have been surprising, however, since every 'Jurassic' sequel has been a disappointment. I'm sure that Colin Trevorrow tried to make an interesting film, but it ultimately turned out rather bland. With horrible cinematography, an exposition-filled screenplay, and an over-reliance on CGI (that will make this film seem older than the original in a few decades), 'Jurassic World' is a major disappointment. Still, once you accept that this is going to be a predictable Hollywood blockbuster, there's some passive fun to be had and there are far worse films of this type out there. Chris Pratt is pretty entertaining too. 5/10.",Jurassic World
346,bravesfanc,The Park is back,8,15 June 2015,"22 years ago we were introduced to ""Jurassic Park"", the proposed theme park where we could go and see dinosaurs in the flesh. While the chaos ensued before the park could open, in ""Jurassic World"" the park is open to the public and it seems to be doing very well. So well in fact, the owner wants a new attraction, aka dinosaur so terrifying even the adults will have nightmares.Predictable plot as this new hybrid dinosaur is much smarter than expected and easily gets out of containment. But this is when the action really picks up as they try to track it down before it's able to get to where the people are. Chris Pratt plays a former Navy Seal who has been working with four velociraptors. We see that they obey him and he's built trust and a relationship with each of them.There are more than a few scenes that are a nod to the original which I enjoyed, the pace of the movie also does a good job with a few light-hearted and comedic moments to relieve the tension. It was fun ride that was more than satisfactory and I'm sure there will be sequels in the near future. 8/10",Jurassic World
347,rcolgan,"It's a dumb movie, but enjoyable nonetheless.",6,20 June 2015,"You'd think that after the first park went so badly that corporations would never try to mutate dinosaurs again. But we humans never seem to learn, as 22 years later and we've got a brand new park even bigger with new deadly attractions bound to cause more chaos. We spend the first 20 minutes of the film seeing the park itself. It's more modern than the tribal feel of the first park, instead going for something more like Universal Park being a fully fledged tourist attraction with modern high tech designs with things like holograms to boot. But despite the park being a success with 20,000 visitors daily, apparently it's still not enough and they need to make a new attraction to lure in new audiences. So they've had the scientists create a new dinosaur that's even bigger and more dangerous called the Indominus Rex. What could possibly go wrong? But then everything goes wrong. The Indominus Rex escapes and begins to hunt for sport, killing every dinosaur and person that it comes against. We see the new dinosaur hunt its prey in interesting ways blending into environments, clawing at thick skinned enemies or armour to find weak points and just charging dead on with brute force to chomp its enemies to bits. On top of the terror of this new dinosaur we also get plenty of cool scenes with trained velociraptors, who despite being trained like circus lions still always pose a threat to the human characters who risk being turned on at any moment. Their uncertain allegiance does lead to some pretty tense stare offs. Whilst the dinosaurs are great, the human characters are far less enjoyable. Most of the characters in the film are either idiots or just plain annoying. Just like the first Jurassic Park we get two new kids here that are visiting the park and who seem to do nothing but get in to trouble and become damsels in distress despite this being a family film and obviously never being in real peril. There's an underutilised Vincent D'Onfrio as a military type who wants to use the dinosaurs for hunting who doesn't seem to have much purpose in the film other than rubbing in the Jurassic Park message that corporations are bad. And Irrfan Khan as the park owner, who comes across as a more annoying, douchey version of Richard Branson. The only good characters are the leads Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). They're both the basic archetypes you'd expect in a blockbuster film playing the Pratt playing the typical quick witted action hero and Howard playing the park manager who goes from a busy bureaucrat to being a caring bad-ass. But they play the archetypes well by remaining likable and getting a fair number of laughs over the course of the film.At times the film does come off as being self contradictory in some of its messages. For example at one point in the film a character jokes about selling out to corporations and that they may as well just name one of the dinosaurs after them. But then the film sells itself out to corporations by naming several products they could name it and filling the film with many product placements from Starbucks to Mercedes. Then there's the way that they mock some blockbuster clichés like the woman ripping her dress up to become a bad-ass, but then indulges in others like the typical stereotypes. Other than one fight scene (which I won't spoil here) none of the fight scenes ever reach anything close to the likes of the iconic T- Rex scene in the first Jurassic Park. At times the action can even begin to feel a little dull or repetitive. And if you think about it too much then you'll be bound to find many plot holes. But there's still enough here to put it ahead of the previous Jurassic Park sequels and is still an enjoyable turn your brain off b-movie blockbuster.",Jurassic World
348,themissingpatient,Dumb but exciting and fun,7,19 June 2015,"Jurassic Park is smart, funny, awe-inspiring and includes some of the most thrilling scenes in film history. It's legendary. Though it was followed by two lackluster sequels, The Lost World and Jurassic Park III, they did not take away the magic of the original film. Now, after 14 years, we have a fourth installment.Jurassic World begins by giving us something the other films never did, a fully functioning park filled with visitors from all over the world. Also, unlike the first two sequels, our expectations are brought to an all-new low within the first act thanks to concepts that threaten to spoil what made the first film so iconic. Jurassic Park did for velociraptors what Jaws did for sharks. Both are forces of nature that should never be tamed or trained. Chris Pratt plays a rugged raptor trainer. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the woman in-charge of running the park. Her two nephews, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, are two of many visitors on the day the events of the film unfold. We are also introduced to two villains, Vincent D'Onofrio, who wants to train velociraptors to be soldiers, and a hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex.A hybrid dinosaur and training raptors to be used as weapons for war - it all sounds pretty dumb and it is. As all of this ridiculousness plays out, the original theme music that would play to help build up the most wondrous parts of the first film is over-used and in all the wrong places. Even worse, after the film moves into it's second act and the action has begun, we are forced back to ride along with the boys, who the screenwriters seem desperate to make us care about with an out-of-place conversation about their parents getting a divorce. It's almost as if Jurassic World sets itself up to disappoint, putting the bar so low in it's first hour that it can only be raised in it's second. If this is the trick Colin Trevorrow is trying to pull on us, he is very successful at it.Jurassic World is a complete failure at being smart and frightening. With all the advanced technology and far-fetched concepts, it's hard to feel any sense of reality or familiarity, two essential ingredients in making us feel as if we are in the character's shoes. There are moments where the filmmakers try to startle us but these attempts at jump-scares are so obvious and poorly executed, they fail. What Jurassic World succeeds at is destroying it's own creations. It's only when the character's lives are in danger that they finally come alive and prove their worth. In the end, Bryce Dallas Howard becomes as bad ass as Chris Pratt.Everything new Jurassic World introduces us to twists back on itself and lets us know that we were right all along, they were all bad ideas. A big part of what made us love that first film so much is brought back in the most exciting of ways. The climax is what we've always wanted out of a Jurassic Park sequel. It's dumb but it's also as exciting and fun as blockbusters get these days. It has the potential to make you feel like a kid again, even if just for a few minutes. But, you have to be willing to let it.",Jurassic World
349,wycherleyp-960-470658,Roaring back to life,8,16 June 2015,"I had a few conversations with people about this film before it was released and one of the biggest problem I had with them is that they thought this film follows Jurassic park 3.....no this film is the sequel to the original Jurassic park from the 90s and it truly is 1hr 55mins of sheer brilliance. With tie ups to a few things from the first film to returning cast members this film is deserving of its box office takings, Chris Pratt yet again shows why he is a box office actor and before I carry on the praise I just hope Chris Pratt does not over do it and become too over situation where there appeal fades. The story follows on years later from first film where the park is up and running but yet again scientists try mess with evolution and it goes wrong, the script/story is basic but the way it's told is great and big shout out to the dinosaurs 😄 with a nice touch to a certain dinosaur from first film. If you want to see a great simple enjoyable film this year I highly recommend this its miles better than avengers 2 and the box office takings back my statement",Jurassic World
350,BigWhiskers,Nothing we haven't seen before,1,16 July 2015,"The problem with this move is that it is nothing we haven't seen already in terms of originality. Jurassic Park introduced us to the exciting scary world of a dinsosaur amusement park gone wrong. Jurassic World does the same thing basically, the only difference is there is more money thrown into CGI and eye candy. The story is nothing new, the same dinsosaurs runnning amuck story and stupid ignorant kids in peril. I found it to be extremely stupid in a lot of scenes too. With people getting munched on by pteranodons in one scene , the main hero decides to kiss the heroine and the kids make smarmy faces, who cares that people are dying all around us , let's stand here and have a smooch . I hate tongue in cheek crap in movies aka SYFY made for TV crap. The training of the raptors was interesting to a point but even that plot element was wasted on an unbelievable turn of events at the climax of the movie. let's also not forget the scene where the heroine outruns a Tyrannosaurus Rex in heels when in Jurassic Park they had to go 60 mph in a jeep to outrun it. That and numerous other ridiculous scenes no doubt added to bring in more money . I am amazed at how much money this has made. It is a cash cow that's for sure. Seeing as how it's been several years since Jurassic Park 3 , one can only surmise a new generation is getting their parents to fork over that 15 a pop to see it again and again. amazing how good movies make less and are called crap while bad movies make tons of cash and are called amazing or special effects masterpieces. 1/10 and that's because I can't give it a zero",Jurassic World
351,Lomedin,No innovation whatsoever,2,17 January 2016,"I made a mistake watching this movie right after the new Mad Max. Ironically, one of the reasons for which I loved Mad Max Fury Road is the use of the same themes, camera angles and tricks from the old movies. That is also one of the reasons for which I find Jurassic World a terrible film.Back when I was 12 or so and I went to watch Jurassic Park in the cinema, I fell in love. OK, I was fascinated by dinosaurs back then, and the movie was innovative in more than one way. I even continued to follow the sequels, and liked them enough.Although I grew up both physically and mentally in these more than 2 decades, unfortunately it seems that the Jurassic Park franchise didn't: they still use the same bad jokes, the same clichés, the same predictability and the same scenes. In this last case, literally: you can actually see some scenes copied from the first movie, perhaps from the other 2 as well. OK, granted, there's not much to do with dinosaurs but to scream, run and hide, although re-using not only stories, plots and sub-plots but scenes themselves with new actors in them is a bit too much. Honestly, at this point, recycling scenes is not an option in what it was a multimillion dollar Hollywood franchise. Let's remember that this is not a remake, but a whole new movie/sequel on its own (presumably).Apart from that, we get some bad acting (that ""cool"" guy, Owen... Jaysus...). Something the previous movies could boast about was a good cast, generally. I missed some cameo, although I liked the appearance of Dr. Wu (even when they gave him such a miserable part - I guess it's more to add to the lack of charm).And, why, oh why, do they have to include dinosaurs brawls??? Are these people 12? Hm, perhaps... Maybe some of us got stuck somewhere back there, more than 2 decades ago.Definitely, a very miss-able movie. Funny how they talk about innovation in it, when the product itself is all but that. One thing they should do, though, is to market those all-purpose high-heels, I'm sure women would appreciate it. I think there's an interesting entry in the msg board about it, along with other ""great"" moments of the film. For all the plot holes, poor acting, repetitive and unimaginative action and so on, I'm extremely surprised and disappointed that Jurassic World has a score of more than 7 here, at the moment.From now on, I will also be screaming, running and hiding from movies directed by this ""genius"".",Jurassic World
352,MattBirk,Straight Forward Popcorn Fun,5,13 June 2015,"Jurassic World is that classic summer blockbuster that we have come to love, high-concept fiction filled with spectacular special effects. It's one of those movies that you can't really hate, but you don't necessarily love. The graphics are great and the idea terrifying, so what more could you ask for from a movie about dinosaurs? There is plenty of action to go around and keep you involved and a variety of new dinosaur attractions to make the movie seem fresh. But that is not to say the movie didn't have problems, the story as a whole was average at best. But who goes into a movie about dinosaurs expecting a strong character driven thriller? There is not much to say here, this is a popcorn movie pure and simple and it exceeds as such.But the main reason holding the movie back from being considered great is that the trailers show just about everything the movie has to offer. From the trailers alone we see the Indominus Rex close up, tame raptors, the gyro-spheres, the mosasaurus (the giant alligator dinosaur), the pteranodon attacking from the sky, and the creators confirming if the tyrannosaurus rex would be in the film or not. The movie left hardly any surprises in the actual movie to make it something special. Not to mention the overall story being extremely predictable, from the downfall of the Indominus Rex, to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard character's relationship with one another. Jurassic World is about as straightforward as you could expect.While Jurassic World isn't the best action movie of the year, it's still quite incredible and breathtaking because of the science both behind the camera (CGI) and in-front of the camera (the park design and the Indominus Rex). It's a fun movie that certainly has its faults, mostly thanks to the marketing team, but there is still something satisfying about watching dinosaurs destroy everything in their path.",Jurassic World
353,Rawal_Afzal,I can watch its as many shows as possible and still never get tired of it!,10,24 July 2015,"I watched it back in June when it was released and couldn't think to compose much of a review, but I watched its second show on Wednesday and I have to admit that I enjoyed it even more and was able to understand it a lot better.It will be a harsh thing to say if people think that this is all about action and there is not much of a plot or story-line. No there is, and quite on the contrary in fact, I think the overall plot is quite a brilliant one. Let's be fair on this, the first one although had a much more logical and better story than the second or the third part, but it was still quite a simple and easy one: experts visit the park in order to issue a cerificate, hell breaks out, that is it (no disrespect intended to the great spectacle that it was back in 1993. It has all my respect and a great coincidence might be that I have at home and just around 50 minutes ago watched it with my brother-in-law's brother).This one however revolves around a much harder plot, one that is not as easy to come up with. So as it goes, in order to win more vistors to the park and to make it more attractive, they think of coming up with something bigger and scarier. In all this, the mistake they make is, they make it a raptor, an animal hugely intelligent. So, whereas it wasn't bigger or scarier than they intended (to make it), but it was surely way more intelligent than that thought. All of a sudden, they realise that they have made a monster, an animal that is now beyond their control. This surely sounds like a great plot to me. Questions might be raised about the aspect of that army-man who jumped into it out of nowhere, coming up with the idea of using these beasts for war, but that still was kind of a sub-story, running on the lines of the main plot. So neither that disturbed me much to be honest.So, 10 out of 10 not only for the action, but also for a pretty smart story-line and a good, sensible build up and connection from scene to scene. Sure enough there must be flaws, but I have this tendency of being generous on films that are able to entertain me.",Jurassic World
354,vistheindian,Sequel the classic deserved,8,16 June 2015,"Quickie Review:After the events of Jurassic Park, 22-years ago, Isla Nublar now hosts the original vision of a functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World. To keep the public interest and raise the visitor rates, the corporation engineer a new breed of dinosaur, Indominus Rex (I-Rex). Meddling with genetic research once again puts the park and people in danger when the I-Rex breaks loose. Jurassic World while not living up to the Spielberg's classic, stands strong on its own merits. The new I-Rex is a great new addition to the roster of scary dinosaurs and the CGI is very well done. There are some sub- plots that don't fit well, but the overall story is a thrill ride with both horror and action. Jurassic World is a great summer- blockbuster monster fun.Full Review:While I was looking forward to Jurassic World, the trailers left me only cautiously optimistic. I had quite a few doubts about the movie: genetic splicing of different dinosaur species, trained raptors, over-reliance on CGI. It all seemed too different from Jurassic Park. After watching the movie all my apprehensions were thrown out the window because different is exactly what Jurassic World needed.Let's start with the star/villain of the movie, I-Rex. The perfect word to describe her is terrifying. The sheer size of her in every aspect, jaw, feet, claws, if you saw her running towards you, to quote the movie ""The kids? This will give their parents nightmares."" Which is perfect! Because that's an essential part of what Jurassic Park was, a horror. It's not just the physicality of the dinosaur but the way she moves, thinks, and takes advantage of her spliced nature that added a lot to her being an insurmountable threat. A lot of the dinosaurs were CGI even for close-ups but it never pulled me out of the movie. The computer visual effects were very well polished, and I am saying that as a huge fan of practical effects where possible. In fact, the dinosaur designs were so well done I'd say they had more personality than most human characters in other movies.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were also very good in the movie. As much I loved Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy as Star- Lord, I didn't want him to play the same character again. Luckily he doesn't and still is a badass. He showed that with the way he interacted with the raptors and the way he'd improvise to get out of a difficult situation. I'd like to reassure you that the way the raptors are trained makes complete sense in the context of the movie. They are still dangerous animals, not completely tamed, so their scenes with Pratt hold a lot of tension. Pratt and the rest of the cast including the kids Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are not completely humourless. There are some good jokes here and there that keep the movie from becoming completely dreary.There are few small issues I do have with the movie but the subplots in particular is what bothered me the most. This is the second time in two weeks there is a movie with a divorce subplot. But the way it is handled in Jurassic World is even worse because it never really affects the story or the characters significantly. There are also other story arcs that are not executed well and so feel out of place. I can't say much else without spoiling the movie but if these subplots were trimmed off, Jurassic World may have been a more well- rounded film.I have to say I really enjoyed my time with Jurassic World. Like for many others Jurassic Park means a lot to me, it's the first Hollywood movie I remember from my childhood. Director Colin Trevorrow did an excellent job in honouring the classic while introducing us to something new. When you watch the movie, you can tell this was a movie made by a fan (a very talented one too) for the fans. By the end of the movie I was applauding it. So if you have your doubts like I did, go watch it, because I'm sure it'll surprise you.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Jurassic World
355,leoxatzian,Yet another flawed but entertaining waste of time.,5,29 January 2019,"As much as the movie wants to be the next Jurassic park, it just ends up being the next ""Jurassic park 3"", in the sense that it is just another fun and idiotic dinosaur movie that just happens to be a sequel to one of Steven Spielberg's masterpieces. The movie has a ton of plot holes illogical moments, very few interesting characters and CGI effects that are full of imagination, but are lacking the realism of the original. In conclusion, this new installment in the blockbuster franchise might not be a mind-blowing piece of work, but it has enough mindlessly entertaining moments to keep it fun.",Jurassic World
356,moviemattb,A Must See!,9,14 June 2015,"After ""Jurassic Park III"" which it did leave me a bitter taste, there was a bunch of talks of making a fourth one. I just thought it needed to stop, but I as read more information about it and the more I began to show some interest. I've read that the filmmakers wanted this film to honor on what made the first one really good, and it just felt like a good sign there. So I stay away as much of any new footage being shown on the internet like trailers; TV spots; etc. I just want to be as surprise as I can be. Was I surprise? Heck yeah! I really love this movie. Before I can go any further, this review will not contain spoilers because you have to see it for yourself. I thought ""Jurassic World"" really did capture the spirit as what the first one did. Is it better than the sequels? Well, as much as I like the second one, I do say that yes it is better than the sequels and it is the second best film of the series. Yes, second best because I don't think its quite as good as the first one, but it is as close as you are going to get. I thought Colin Trevorrow has done a fantastic job on making this movie, and making us feel like kids again. The story is very well told, and I do love the look of the theme park as it makes you want to go there and have lots of fun. As long as you don't get eaten by dinosaurs. The cast all did great. Chris Pratt does an awesome job for playing such likable lead, and I thought Bryce Dallas Howard did good as well. The movie is, thankfully, a two hour ride as what the first two movies were because I wasn't a fan of the run time on the third one. The movie does have its wondrous moments and it has a lot more excitements, and really filled with dinosaur action. The music by Michael Giacchino is pretty darn good, and he was the right choice to do score for reminded us of John Williams' music like what he did with his other film ""Super 8."" The design of the new dinosaur looks really good, but nothing more I can say about it. I do find it interesting where the Raptors are working with Pratt's character. The ending I won't give away is beautiful, because I was laughing happily and tears were pouring down from my eyes as I was now crying that it just shows how much I love the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie. So what is wrong with the movie? While I do say the special effects are really good, and I am glad that they are sticking with the tradition for using practical and CGI effects. However, I do wish if the filmmakers can use a bit more on practical effects. Also, there are some characters that I like while they are others that kind of annoyed me. Vincent D'Onofrio may have done a fine job, but he is just there to play a bad guy. That is about it. So, yeah the movie does have its flaws, but it doesn't take away the experience that I had with this movie. I am glad Steven Spielberg gave it a stamp approval because he thought it felt like seeing ""Jurassic Park"" again. I pretty much cannot denied it. ""Jurassic World"" is a must see, and I am giving it a 9 out of 10.",Jurassic World

It is way better than the god awful sequels? Absolutely. I didn't fall in the love with this movie, but I can certainly say that I liked it. It's a fun popcorn monster movie that just about everyone can enjoy. Be warned though, there is a lot of really stupid stuff in this movie. First off the notion that this park would ever open is ludicrous. This takes place after the first movie, so the events that took place there still happened. I find it hard to believe anybody would come to this place after people died on the first attempt. Bryce Dallas Howard's character was wearing high heels the whole time. Keep that in mind when you're watching this movie. There's also a really stupid decision made by the kids in this movie that I can't say without having spoilers. But in the end, all those things don't ruin the movie. I got to see dinosaurs kill stuff and I was entertained by it. I say go see it.",Jurassic World

The writers and director thought ""Lets make Jurassic World, we have the technology that Spielberg dreamed of"" and what we get is a similar plot to Jurassic Park with a few tweaks and modernisation but it's not enough as the movie is already too much up it's own a** with eye candy visuals and cheesy dialog at it's fingertips.

359,bjones,Great film!,8,12 June 2015,"I saw this film this evening (Thurs 6-11-15). I had to go to a later showing than I normally would because earlier times were sold out. There's a lot of great word-of-mouth. I think it deserves it! For me, it's the best since the original JP film. It is an excellent addition to the series. As things have evolved in the movie world, CGI makes just about anything that can be dreamt of visually possible. The only barrier left is the imagination of the filmmakers. So there's not much of anything new that can be added (I also saw it in 3-D. What's left to improve the movie going experience are the human creations: acting, story, sets, costumes, etc. I like what they did here. I especially liked the acting. Chris Pratt is the best actor yet to appear in these films - completely believable as an action star. He'd be a terrific Indiana Jones (as has been rumored) or even Han Solo; not to mention any number of new movie heroes yet invented. I like everything about him. I'd even go so far as to say he made the film.His co-star; Bryce Dallas Howard, was excellent opposite him. Although there was little chance to show it in this type of film, they had great chemistry. I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone; but the physical side of their relationship would have made a great film on its own (and considerably easier to make!). I loved her look in the film; almost China-doll-like at the beginning, although more of her natural freckles would have been wonderful. She is a stunning beauty and a great actress in the bargain. The rest of the cast did a standout job as well. Vincent D'Onofrio made a great guy to dislike. I also liked Jake Johnson, Irrfan Khan, BD Wong (the only cast member from the original Jurassic Park I think) and Judy Greer. Bravo to all!Onthe final analysis, very worth seeing.",Jurassic World
360,Harhaluulo54,Self-aware comedy which I found to be better and more entertaining than expected,6,13 July 2015,"Jurassic World starts off with 7 minutes of nonsense and mess which can easily turn the viewer down. ""Please kill me."" - the movie probably. Everything is just wrong with it from acting to editing, and outrageous mercedes and beats ads. Then, an evil Asian ninja comes to the screen with his lines and makes sure no one will refer to this movie without the word ""self-aware"" any longer. From that moment on, non of the bad twists and lacking writing, logic or anything that usually would/could be criticized in a story of this caliber, can be taken as an insult towards viewers intelligence, nor will it be possible to get mad over this, because now it is all pure comedy gold. I will not bother analyzing the story as I see no reason to like this movie for that. The heart lies withing the pandering, ridiculously over the top scenes and, over all, pure hilarious adventure which this movie is all about. We have guys from friendzoned beta spaghetti to 'garu stu saves the day and gets the girls'. We have scene where guy shoots t-rex with a freaking bazooka. Know those scenes where an object with huge mass almost leaves someone crushed between it and a wall, but then it stops withing an inch and nothing bad happened whatsoever? We have this trope... executed with a flying dinosaur. Do I have to say more? Not laughing at these not only indicate bad sense in humor, but downright awful life's philosophy. All in all I can recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have huge bias towards the earlier franchise, but most of all, to anyone who can understand that movie doesn't have to be smart to be brilliant.",Jurassic World
361,Equalizer16,Almost the same to the original and very predictable,6,21 August 2015,"They cloned dinosaurs and tried to make them a theme park attraction, it went wrong, research teams tried to examine the remains, it went wrong. Now they've remade the park, with more dangerous creatures lurking around, what could possible go wrong? THIS!! Instead of moving on from the idea of a dinosaur petting zoo, the managers of the park believe it can still work with no loose dinosaurs. However, the idiot scientist think it will be no danger to breed their own dinosaur with a mixture of different creature DNA. So eventually a highly intelligent blood thirsty dinosaur becomes loose around Jurassic World.The film is completely fuelled with intense, pulse racing action that Jurassic Park delivered only bigger and louder. Although it is new I did believe that the film is almost the exact same feature to the original, with the exceptions of a slightly different narrative and several annoying characters.The film does present though an interesting narrative, and brilliant visual effects. There is also a small emotional theme to the story of the relationship between the dinosaurs and humans, which I think Chris Pratt executes brilliantly.Sadly the film becomes very predictable with other themes presented throughout the story, and becomes infested in plot wholes. Throughout watching it I could not help but think WHY? To the characters as they perform stupid actions and not even do the sensible thing. There are also moments of intense gory images and disturbing scenes, which make men question the certificate of the film but also nearly made me believe I was watching a horror movie.Overall to me the film was just exhausting, familiar, and annoying.

362,hoxjennifer,Worth the Hype!,8,1 July 2015,"I will confess that I haven't seen the first three Jurassic Park films, so my opinion is just based on the Jurassic World movie on its own without comparison to its predecessors. I wasn't quite sure about this movie at first. I thought it would be another half-a** sequel with lots of CGI to make up for its lack of actual substance. I was proved wrong. Jurassic World is definitely worth the hype. The park itself is absolutely beautiful and something I would love to visit if it actually existed. Chris Pratt does a great job as the alpha male lead. The movie is full of clichés, but it is also full of action and amazing visual effects. I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth the watch.",Jurassic World
363,Eric_Cubed,Awful but watchable,2,24 June 2015,"Everyone loved this movie, and I admit it was put together quite well. Great editing, cinematography, editing, script and acting, all very slick. A little too slick, by the book, by the numbers, predictable story line and plot. There is an island. On the island is a dinosaur theme park. The humans have every technological ability to keep the dinosaurs from escaping. That is, until the humans make a dinosaur with DNA from a all these different species that allows it to break free. And then we have nonstop consumption of humans, chasing of the dinosaurs, and by the numbers plot advances, romantic liasians and family friendly cute kid scare scenes (man, if those kids got eaten, this movie would be a 10!) One can almost feel the presence of the big time gambling producers, Steven Spielberg's watchful eye, and every gatekeeper imaginable controlling the thing, until the final result is inevitable: a massive bore-festing yawn-athan I could not wait to be over as I sat uncomfortably in the theater. I wish I had brought edibles with me many times during the over two hour soap opera. Are the special effects awesome? Yes. Is this any different in any way from the previous films, in term of artistic integrity and real risk taking? No. Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots this film is not.

365,japamo,"It Only Makes Sense for a Hybrid ""Dinosaur Movie"" to Have a Hybrid Dinosaur",8,23 June 2015,"I knew it, I just knew it – or at least partially knew it. In my IMDb review for ""Jurassic Park III (which I admired very much, by the way, so there!!!) I predicted that the follow-up movie would involve some kind of dinosaur DNA manipulation and creation of new dinosaur hybrids. Lo and behold, the movie Jurassic World (hereafter ""JW"") introduces a hybrid, christened ""Indomitus Rex (I-rex)"" which is an amalgam of T-Rex and raptor DNA, plus non-dinosaur DNA such as from the tree frog and the cuttlefish (which is a type of gastropod or squid with chromatophores that allow it to camouflage itself by changing colors). That's why, in addition to its extra knife-like teeth, robust arms, and Wolverine-like claws, I-Rex has the ""Predator"" - like ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings. Basically, it looks like the Spinosaurus from ""JPIII"" without the spines. I-Rex came into being, because, according to JW's operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the InGen-owned dinosaur theme park was suffering diminishing attendance as people were getting jaded and blasé about ""ordinary"" dinosaurs, (which I found hard to believe) and needed a brand-new, better dinosaur. InGen and JW succeeded beyond their wildest nightmares.As my title suggests, originality and social commentary are not high on JW's agenda. Even as it borrows and copies scenes and concepts (sometimes almost wholesale) from all three of its Jurassic Park movie predecessors, JW doesn't bang you over the head with the ethical implications of cloning and exploiting dinosaurs for human amusement. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) are not present to poke at our consciences. No, JW borrows from yet another movie source, the ""Godzilla"" films, to scare both park and movie audiences with a terrifying, practically invincible monster attacking everything in its path, sometimes (as with the apatosaurs) just for the thrill of it.Actually, there is one person who does disapprove of ""JW""'s hybridization program. That would be rugged, good-looking, Navy veteran Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who for some inexplicable reason is serving as surrogate mother and ""whisperer"" to a pack of raptors who imprinted on him upon hatching (as implied from the movie's beginning). But for whatever reason he attempts to ""tame"" and ""control"" his charges, he has no intention of allowing InGen security head Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) to use the raptors as military weapons a la the ""Alien"" franchise (I was thinking how Vic would do such a thing; despite their speed and ferocity, raptors can't fire guns and aren't bullet-proof – oh well). Therefore, besides the distracted, workaholic, ex-girlfriend Claire, Owen has to constantly butt heads with Vic.Anyway, before long, the I-Rex uses his chameleon powers and cunning as well as brute strength to escape from his remote enclosure and make his deadly bee-line for the theme park. To complicate matters further, Claire's nephews, dinosaur geek expert Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his hormonally-charged older brother Zach (Nick Robinson) are simultaneously visiting the park. Therefore, the plot simply involves stopping the I-Rex before it destroys the park, kills off or frees the other dinosaurs, decimates the customers, including Zach and Gray, and, horror of horrors, sinks InGen's latest investment!In some ways, besides having similarities to the movies already mentioned, JW resembles ""Independence Day"" in the way that it is engrossing, exciting, and involving, just so long as you don't think too deeply about it. Otherwise, you will notice the nagging inconsistencies and foolish, nonsensical behavior like - the I-Rex crashing through walls - a security guard hiding behind a car that the I-Rex can flip like a Tonka toy - Claire running in high heels (even after Owen tells her to lose them) - the raptors switching loyalties back and forth between Owen and the I-Rex - Vic sticking his hand out to pet a snarling raptor - Claire (still in high heels) going to a secret enclosure to summonguess who (no,it's not King Kong) to take on the I-Rex in a pulse-pounding, earth-shaking climactic fight, - the mosasaur (the colossal water creature) demonstrating both the deus ex machina principle and the Chekov gun principle, if you know what I mean (if you don't, you can look up those principles on Wikipedia, as I did).But, hey, it's summer. Who thinks during the summer? ""JW"" is the perfect example of the Summer Dinosaur Monster movie. Send your brain to bed and let JW treat you and your emotions to an immensely rollicking good time!",Jurassic World
366,mitchell5954,"An Entertaining, But Unnecessary Nostalgia Trip",5,11 January 2019,"Jurassic World is the fourth installment (you can say second considering it actively ignores the previous two sequels) in the Jurassic Park franchise which is one of my favorite franchises. I like all the installments for various reasons, film or literary, no matter how bad some can get. The first film is one of my favorite movies period. The Lost World, while inferior to the first film definitely, is still a worthy sequel and I feel is a very underrated film. I'm also a fan of the books by Michael Crichton of which the first two movies are based on. Jurassic Park 3, while certainly not a good movie like its predecessors, I can enjoy as an entertaining monster movie.I wasn't expecting too much going into this film. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the first film or even the second one. I was only expecting it to be an entertaining monster movie like the third film and that's exactly what got.The story is very simple. Twenty years after when the first film took place the park is officially opened (had been for years) and tourists are flocking to it by the truck loads. However, people had become desensitized and bored by regular dinosaurs so the owners and scientists in their infinite wisdom decided to create a genetically modified hybrid to up the wow factor. However, the hybrid escapes and starts wreaking havoc around the park and freeing other dinosaurs from their containers and everything goes awry.The film does have a few things going for it. It is quite entertaining as a straight forward monster movie and it did give me feelings of nostalgia. I like it mainly for the same reasons I like Jurassic Park 3 in that it's a fun monster movie.I also like that it tries to do something different with actually having the park up and running along with the incorporation of the dinosaur hybrid which is a cool monster with a nice design. Easily my favorite thing about this film is the Indominus Rex. It's a cool design, and it was enjoyable watching it work. The park itself also looks very nice and it was cool to actually see the park actually functioning.Chris Pratt also does a good job as the lead and I liked his character. I was worried from the trailers of him being a raptor whisperer. However, I think they handle it fairly well. It further establishes that these dinosaurs are not monsters (besides the new hybrid) but animals as the first two films made clear. I also like that they establish he's not in full control and the relationship has to be constantly tested. He's like a lion tamer.However, that's where the praise ends. Firstly, the CGI is horrible. It's been over twenty years since the first film yet the effects are easily the worst out of all the films. JP 3 had better effects than this. The effects for these films should be getting better not worse. The dinosaurs all look so incredibly fake it's not even funny. All the other films used animatronics along with the CG but this it's obviously 100% CG. If they did use animatronics then they definitely used CG over them.Also, the cast is subpar. Chris Pratt's character is good but he's the only one in my opinion. All the other character I was not invested in at all. Granted there was no character I adamantly disliked but no one I really cared for either besides Chris Pratt. The villain is also very one-note but, thankfully, he doesn't play a major role.Not to mention there are so many nods and even scenes reenacted from the first film it's ridiculous. I know this is the first film from this franchise in a long time and some nods are fine but there were so many of the same beats being hit it got a bit annoying. The final battle especially felt a lot like the final battle from Jurassic park with the raptors.Overall, Jurassic World is not a worthy sequel to the first two movies. I'd say it's on par with JP 3. In fact, I like JP 3 a bit more because of my nostalgia for it. However, if you're a fan of Jurassic Park then there's no reason not to see this.",Jurassic World
367,DrTuvok,So much better than people give it credit for...,8,27 March 2021,"...though it of course is not without its flaws.Really, the thing that makes this movie, outside of its massive entertainment value, is the meta-aspect. The people running Jurassic World ARE the movie's own producers and are faced with their exact same problems! Watch the movie to see what I am talking about; they lean into this aspect pretty cleverly. (It also explains why there are no feathered dinosaurs, something that some scientists were apparently upset over.)Oh yes, it's also hilarious to see all the outcry over the character Claire being 'sexist' because she is a workaholic jerk who wears high heels. Give me a break. These people will never be finished until all blockbuster female characters are bland, dull, masculine caricatures like Captain Marvel, too scared of political incorrectness to be interesting or even realistic. At least Claire had some personality.",Jurassic World

So, we want more thrill, more variety and more adventures than the previous movies. And this movie surely offers thrills, varieties and adventures in 3D format. If you loved Jurassic Park, or not, you just have to watch this at any cost, because it's worth it. Irrfan Khan is the owner of Jurassic World. His role is bigger than I thought it would be! He is superb as usual. The main hero, Chris Pratt is also acts well and handsome hunk, too. Ty and Nick, two kids, are also good in their respective roles. Their bonding as brothers described well. Heroine is Bryce Dallas Howard and she is pretty and also acts good. Supporting cast is good. Locations and camera-work is undoubtedly too good. In this type of movies, the director's work depends on the camera-work and visual effects. Both are equally good. We can't imagine that the creatures which we are seeing, are fake! Kudos to the team. Some scenes can make you surprise. You can't control yourself for saying Oh, my God! Jumping of the kids in the river is one of those scenes. If you want to be stress-free, tension-free, and want to enjoy your weekend with your family, than this is a delight watch for you.

Sadly were as Kingsman had strong and amazing characters with a lot of layers Jurassic World instead goes for a more cheesy and over the top approach that I really don't like at all. For this reason it lost a lot of its greatness when the idea of going back to see it again came into my mind. It is a film that I like overall, but has so notable issues. The characters aren't well defined. The children are just annoying little brats as well. Yet the film still manages to succeed on other fronts such as its CGI is great and soo much fun to look at in 3D or IMAX. The overall experience is really gripping and interesting as well making for an overall pretty fun final product. In the end while a flawed film it still worth the watch",Jurassic World
372,trnjamesbond,Jurassic Park Remake,1,24 June 2015,"I give this a negative 10 out of a positive 10. Aside from IMDb's idiot scale, and it's paid off Metacritic garbage. Jurassic Park(1994) was one of the most ground breaking films of it's time.Jurassic World is one of the most disappointing films of it's time. Let me explain.Jurassic World is like a mixture between going to Disney World for the first time(in 1984, with the whole Monorail Idea) but with Dinosaurs. There is no magic here, only lot's and lot's of CGI, Spielberg's original film was amazing, not only because he rewrote how Dino's should look, but realized some things must be old school as well.(this film takes a very lazy George Lucas approach ALL CGI) Not everything should be digitized. If you think my logic is incorrect, I must ask you one question, have you seen the remake of Spielberg's Poltergeist? I will tell you how that turned out, just go and visit Rotten Tomatoes. It was listed as rotten. Jurassic World is nothing but a recreation or reboot of the original, in order to squeeze a few more bucks out of Dino's. It really did nothing for me, all the original character's were there, the Park Owner, the Protector of the Dino's, the Creator, also the know it all's, along with the kids seeking adventure. (another carbon copy) Even with the new invention of creating a hybrid Dino, there really is nothing new to this story, this all happened in the original! Also the scenes involving mass panic was just accentuated by making the visitors a bunch of whiny rich CEO's. Conclusion.If your into the latest in sub par CGI films without a story, and like bland characters that have the same roles in 1994 and you also like films that are all about effect's and no content, or originality then I must say this is the film for you!But if your a more down to earth person that wants something more original, and doesn't try to copy everything Spielberg sis the first time while filming Jurassic Park, well I must say avoid this film at all cost's.",Jurassic World
373,byson5186,Dinosaurs Seemed More Realistic 22-Years Ago,8,12 June 2015,"No doubt, one of the biggest movies ever made is the first Jurassic Park movie. That movie is still great to watch 22-years later. Sometimes, I'll put it on when I want to have a movie night. I'm sure a lot of us who have seen the first Jurassic Park have seen it more than once. Jeff Goldblum even talks about kids who watch Jurassic Park everyday on the bonus features. So, it is definitely an entertainer for younger audiences. Also, the computers in that movie don't seem that old. I mean, yeah we have flat screen computers and we don't use floppy disks anymore. Some of the icons in the first movie look a little old, but the way the computers work seem impressive even by todays standards and probably work better than we'd think a 1992 computer would work.Since the first one came out, they have made 3 more Jurassic Park movies. Since the 3rd one came out, I have long since heard of a 4th one coming out, even on IMDb and have heard different plots and Jurassic Park 4. They finally came up with a plot for the fourth film and rather than call it Jurassic Park 4, they changed it to Jurassic World. I feel like that this movie sequel, came up with the best plot for the franchise especially one that hasn't been used. Because, If you've seen the first two Jurassic Park films, you'll know they recreated the dinosaurs for tourism. They intended to have dinosaurs on display at a park, mostly for kids. This was John Hammond's idea. As you've seen on the trailers and the website. You'll know that Jurassic World is a fully functioning park that has been opened to the public for 10 years, so at this point people still enjoy touring the park, but it is no longer such a big deal having dinosaurs around.This movie will definitely keep you entertained and on your seat at the movie theater. It also seemed like everybody I talked to in the movie theater liked this movie. Though, everybody seemed to prefer the first two over this. But, they can all agree it was better than the 3rd as I don't care for that movie. I noticed a lot of things that if they thought more of, they could have made a much better movie and here are the reasons:1. My Title: Which is what I thought, despite this coming out 22-years later, the dinosaurs seemed more realistic, sounded more realistic, and even looked and acted more realistic in the first film. The dinosaurs would have been more entertaining if they kept them like the first. 2. At times it was cheesy: The characters and dinosaurs seemed a little cheesy some of the time. 3. The Characters Don't Entertain The Same As The Original Cast: I felt like Zach and Gray held up to Lex and Tim. But, the other characters from this movie, while entertaining they do not keep up with the characters we know from the original films: Allen Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, John Hammond, Mr. Arnold, Robert Muldoon, and Dennis Nedry. You'll prefer those characters over these ones. 4. We Coud Have Gotten To Know The Park Better: It's cool thinking dinosaurs are on display at a park for tourism. I feel like they should have taken more minutes showing us more what's at Jurassic World, along with showing us more of the dinosaurs.5. Less Sneaky/Scary: I still think of the first one as scary, but I didn't really think of this one as scary, though definitely entertaining. I feel like part of the reason, is because the dinosaurs seemed less sneaky as they do a good job in showing sneaky dinosaurs in the first film which makes it more scary. They seemed to take us more to the action. 6. The Island Looking Different: I felt like in this movie, Isla Nublar looked different and seemed less realistic than it did in the first film. The size also seems inconsistent, and while the park would change, the size of the island wouldn't. So, it didn't feel like we were on the Isla Nublar we knew in the first and I like the paddocks better in the first film. 7. The Music Not Quite As Good: We hear the main theme in the movie, but I think it would have been better if they played the music from the first film, or better background music. It would have been cool if they played the song from the first where Dennis Nedry shuts down the security systems. 8. Unanswered Questions: While these Jurassic Park movies seem canon and it has references to the first one, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. The only character that's the same is Dr. Wu. I feel like it would have been better if they did more references to the park, like explaining more the history of the park. They didn't seem to mention anything from the 2nd and 3rd films. But, they definitely should have answered how they were able to get Isla Nublar running after the incidents in the first 3 films. They also talked about engineering in this movie and referred to the dinosaurs as she, but were they intended to be all female like in the first movie, or did they realize they couldn't do it? 9. More Action: I feel like there could have been more action, especially with all the tourists at the park. So while this movie is a great film, there are so many things that should have been more thought out of, which would have made this a much better film holding up to the first. For entertainment purposes, I give it an 8. But, I'm subtracting a 2 for the things I mentioned above.",Jurassic World
374,valen060,Caution: Park Has Reopened!,9,13 June 2015,"First off, it's hard to imagine that it's been twenty-two years since Michael Crichton's original novel Jurassic Park leapt from its fine pages and graced cinema screens under Steven Spielberg's direction to a wide array of audiences with breathtaking visuals and a plot that provided a theory on how science can be both groundbreaking and seriously flawed at the same time.In this sequel, over two decades have passed since the incident on Isla Nublar's Jurassic Park and it would seem founder John Hammond's legacy continues to live on with the reopening of the park now in full swing as ""Jurassic World"" with tourists from all over the world visiting to see real-live dinosaurs. However, the follies of human beings still loom upon introducing the first hybrid dinosaur that may as well outrank the park's once signature T-Rex.'Guardians of the Galaxy' star, Chris Pratt plays rational Velociraptor tamer Owen Grady as he must deal with the goings-on behind the scenes of the now vast expansion of the park. It's like his character basically borrows the Dino-savvy traits of Sam Neill's Dr. Alan Grant and the survival instincts of Bob Peck's Game Warden Robert Muldoon. Whereas, Bryce Dallas Howard as park operations manager Claire Dearing is a typical portrayal of a hard-working individual who hardly has a life outside of her work (like watching her own nephews venturing in the park). As both characters must work together, they must also stop corrupt individuals who secretly plot to use the dinosaurs for their own personal gain, which I found obvious the moment they spoke about these creatures' capabilities. Claire's nephews Zach and Gray - played by Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins respectively - loosely mirror the original siblings Lex and Tim Murphy, who are inadvertently thrown into this perilous adventure when attacked by the hybrid dinosaur.The entire plot and theme does feel very similar to its 1993 predecessor - thus tending to make some pivotal scenes predictable - in terms of the consequences in corporate greed and how our most greatest creations can also meet our darkest fears. But I'd say it works out fine by introducing this to an entirely new generation who were too young or weren't even born to witness what the film series had done years prior. With enough action, suspense, and Pratt's occasional humor, it does not distract from the movie's pacing.I was disappointed none of the human characters from the past movies ever returned to reprise their roles (save for B.D. Wong's reprisal of Dr. Henry Wu), but I understand what new director Colin Trevorrow meant by ""shoehorning them into the exact same predicament"" over and over again without a proper reason. For the casual film-goer, it's a delight to see how much has been offered whether you're nostalgic or a newcomer. I felt relieved that this movie sequel didn't stray into B-Movie territory as 2001's Jurassic Park III and instead greatly one-ups it with a better plot and depth. The visual effects certainly have advanced these days since I noticed some usage of motion-capture in a few scenes. It's impressive the film crew didn't rely too heavily on often-used CGI effects, but the subtle use of animatronics and 'suitmation' as well. Although not really groundbreaking at all as the first movie, it nevertheless had a vibrant new cast and I loved that some scenes in the movie paid tribute or an homage to Steven Spielberg's 1993 original with flying colors. I'm glad these filmmakers never forgot those roots and kept them intact to acknowledge its presence. With the accompanying music score of Michael Giacchino (standing in for original composer John Williams), it gives a nice touch to what Jurassic Park's opening theme was known well for. My thoughts, it's a sequel that stands proudly as the majestic T-Rex once did in its prehistorical era.",Jurassic World
375,randymcbeast,Even worse than ripoff Dinosaur B movies,2,13 July 2015,"I'm just amazed that this film made so much money. It started out okay and it reminded me of the original but then a crack here and a crack there and then it just completely fell apart.I then checked the time to see where I was in the movie and I was just half way through. Ugh! Not surprisingly, the second half just kept disappointing, although there was a good special effect here and there.Overall, it was just plain dumb and utterly ridiculous. Bad, really bad, like one of those low budget dinosaur ripoff movies but even worse because it dishonored the amazing original coming from the same family. It was like if Robert Deniro spawned Charles Manson as a son.The acting was horrible. The actors were not likable at all. The storyline and how it moved along was not realistic or believable. Horrible stuff.There were just so much wrong with this movie. I could list about a thousand problems but I would be giving too much away. Honestly, Spielberg is so done.

It didn't disappoint either, I feel they played safe with a similar style to the original classic which was fine by me cause it did enough differently for it to be appreciated. Rather than match the suspense of the original it when gung ho on action and effects with a huge screen time for dinosaurs which is what we all came to watch. It was a little corny here and there but i think it saved itself with playing on that a couple times to not take itself too seriously. I loved how they incorporated the original into the story too and thought the ending was breathtakingly good. Good show from the actors, especially Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, the child actors where a weak link but overall this is a fantastic blockbuster movie.",Jurassic World

378,drawlife,"The novelty is gone, it's flawed, but enjoyable.",6,11 June 2015,"Now right off the bat, this is the best Jurassic Park sequel. But that really isn't saying too much. It's been almost 22 years since the original film and the franchise is showing it's age. How many times are we going to see scientists make the same mistake over and over again? You can only recycle familiar plot points so many times, the only thing that was intriguing and refreshing to watch was the realization of John Hammond's dream coming true, and the fact that because of all this technology and the fact that dinosaurs exist, people just don't seem that amazed by it and the Jurassic World park has to have a new attraction in order to spike up attendance. It's implied that the novelty has worn off for the people in that universe, I think the same can be said about for us as the audience. With paper-thin characters and very clichéd I might add, you don't particularly care about anyone, except maybe Chris Pratt's Owen Grady. I disliked almost everyone in the cast simply because they were just fodder like most Jurassic Park characters are, also I'd like to add that the comedy felt slightly forced. But Pratt's Owen is different. He doesn't have the cool, hip, and eccentric persona as Ian Malcolm or the appeal of Alan Grant, but he's the only character that I found myself to get on board with despite him coming off as a little stiff. He also does add a bit of Star-Lord charm within his performance. Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, and the rest are just plain unbearable. Also, how many times is a Jurassic Park film going to involve children, I'm very sick of it, we're four films into the franchise and they keep involving children. It's obvious I wasn't very fond of Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson.What saves this film are the dinosaurs, as always. At times it becomes more of a monster film, but it's still fun to watch all the carnage and the chaos that ensues when everything goes to hell. The last maybe 20-30 minutes of this film really kicks it into high gear. The dinosaurs look as great as ever and the special effects are first rate. The new Indominus Rex is terrifying and brutal. Allowing it to camouflage was a smart move on the developers of the film. The velociraptors are always fun, but I must say I think I liked them a lot more in Jurassic World. I totally bought into relationship the raptors had with Owen. It didn't seem as unbelievable as I thought it would. Never have we seen raptors react this way with a human so it was quite a refreshing take. The usage of the Pteranodons, Dimorphodons and Mosasaur were all used well, but there is an awesome T-Rex scene that will just bring goosebumps and nostalgia joy to many Jurassic Park fans. This is a fun summer popcorn flick. Although the flaws are apparent and it's very formulaic, it's still hard not to have fun and director Colin Trevorrow does the best job he can. I'm open to more chapters as long as it doesn't involve more children in peril, dumb scientists and corporate officials, lack of common sense, and thinly written protagonists. I will admit that can be hard to achieve, but I don't think it's impossible and an idea of a possible fifth film was played upon in the film so perhaps it has the potential to be solid? 6.3/10",Jurassic World
379,malmborgimplano-92-599820,"Finally, a worthy sequel to the original Jurassic Park",10,13 June 2015,"The Lost World stank, Jurassic Park III was just okay (PTEROSAURS make up for a lot of deficiencies) but this film is in every way up to the standards of the original. I enjoyed myself thoroughly except for having to listen to the shrieks of the terrified little kids whose parents were sadistically forcing them to sit through it. In my opinion this film would merit a PG-13 as it features more gore and genuinely horrific moments than any of the previous Jurassic films, so if you're planning on taking your babies to it so they can see the funny dinosaurs, really, think again.I liked Spielberg's Jurassic Park a lot, but I also love Michael Crichton's original novel, and although the Spielberg film was a smart, deliberate and fully authorized bastardization of Crichton's story, it was a candy-coated distortion nevertheless. Crichton's novel is about greedy, arrogant people creating a totally foreseeable and avoidable disaster, and in this film a new generation of equally greedy, arrogant people are back, creating an even bigger disaster. It can't be a coincidence that some of the most capable and aware people staffing new Jurassic World are Iraq-Afghanistan veterans (speaking of DISASTERS CREATED BY GREEDY ARROGANT PEOPLE) and that they are aware that animals, like humans, can get PTSD if thrown into situations with no regards for their basic psychological needs. The characters in this story are considerably more three-dimensional than in the previous films, especially the leading lady Claire, who undergoes an unexpected and satisfying character journey from corporate dingbat to war-torn survivalist. I liked seeing Henry Wu again and finally getting to hear his side of the story, and Jack Johnson filled in the Jeff Goldblum spot in the picture as the righteous geek with the added advantage of NOT BEING ANNOYING. Just for good measure there is one bona fide heroic leading man with the required characteristics of beauty, goodness and wisdom, and he just happens to be a Southerner who lives in a trailer! which I believe is a Hollywood first.",Jurassic World
380,christophershobris,Felt like two different movies,6,29 June 2015,"As I say in the title I felt like I was watching two different movies as if they were directed by two different directors. Furthermore I'm not familiar with Colin Trevorrow (the film's director) as I heard this is one of his first films to direct and it shows. The film had a mixture of good and bad parts. Some that take you back to what you loved about Jurassic Park. While others just make no absolute sense. However the good things that stand out are the dinosaurs. Meaning the film did it's job of giving us what we came for - and the dinos are the reason why this film is worth the price of admission. With that I was satisfied but where there is a good side there is a bad side as well. The bad almost out ways the good. First off all the human characters with the exception of Chris Pratt's character were so damn annoying and cartoony. It's been a while since I saw a group of characters I disliked. But there are the characters I disliked more then others. Those would be the children. Oh my goodness, these kids make me want to punch them in the face. You got the generic whinny brat and the know it all jerk. I prefer the kids from Jurassic Park over these any day. But I was however blown away by the end which I won't spoil but it made me feel like a kid again watching Jurassic Park. And it made watching the movie worth while. Now to grade it.

382,zombiefan89,A lot of call backs to the original,9,27 October 2017,"If you haven't seen the first film, an idiot billionaire wanted to make a theme park/zoo of live dinosaurs. What could go wrong? Well, Jurassic World takes that concept up to 11. The Computer Generated dinosaurs are passable at best. This movie tries to recapture the magic of the original, but it's really difficult. The biggest problem is that there's a lot of suspension of disbelief. After the numerous deaths and a freaking T-Rex slaughtering people in a city, it's hard to imagine anyone would touch the ""Jurassic Park"" concept with a ten foot pole. Not only that, it would be impossible to get insurance on such a theme park/zoo. The T-Rex attack on a city in ""Lost World"" would be the disastrous equivalent of September 11th or Pearl Harbor in the Jurassic Park universe. There's just no way there could ever be a ""Jurassic World"". It's just too much of a liability.",Jurassic World
383,lovintennis,It was OK; nothing special by any means,4,7 August 2017,"My two biggest problems about it are: 1) the older brother being girl- obsessed in a really weird way (He's absurdly depressed about leaving his girlfriend for a little while at the beginning, then, all he does early on at the park is stare at other girls he likes and then smile when they eventually giggle at him staring at them. His little brother appropriately lets him know it's not going to do anything by him just staring, which makes them laugh and walk away. He gives his brother a sarcastic thanks and I thought, ""Well what do you expect? You weren't going to have anything going for yourself and it was for your own good. Either talk to them or don't; don't just keep staring at them like a total weirdo."" 2) It's obvious, at the climax, the huge main dinosaur they're after is some kind of raptor from her communicating with the raptors; you don't need to have Mr. Pimp Daddy be the one to figure it out while everyone else is clueless: ""I know why they wouldn't tell us what it really is."" (Gosh, ya think?) ""Why?"" ""That thing is part-raptor."" (You're a quick one.)",Jurassic World
384,AzSumTuk,What the actual f@$#,5,20 July 2015,"Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park"" was and still is one of my favorite books. I read it when I was eight, and it quickly turned me into a dinosaur nerd. I dreamed of becoming a paleontologist, I collected encyclopedias about dinosaurs and I could name even the rarest dinosaur species you would see on TV or film. For some reason I hadn't seen the book's adaptation before I was 18 and when I saw it, I was bitterly disappointed. It was just stupid. However, when I saw it for the second time, I kinda liked it. It wasn't the book, but it was a fine action/adventure movie. Of course, the visual effects were outstanding. I even liked its' sequel. I don't think I have seen 'Jurassic Park 3', and I will probably never waste my time with it.But I did see 'Jurassic World'. I expected it to be a funny movie with lots of dinosaurs... Well, it was definitely funny, although for all the wrong reasons. This has got to be the worst high budget summer movie I have ever seen. Nothing really works in it, not even the visual effects - they are just awful, sorry. Well, not exactly awful, the dinosaurs' moves are well done and the creatures blend nice with the scenery, but one can say the same thing about the dinosaurs in ""Terra Nova"" - and that is a TV show. The CGI in 'Jurassic World' lacks detail. It looks as if it was made in the 90s. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' came out ten years ago, and its' visual effects were much more detailed. Not to mention movies like 'Avatar' - when it comes to... everything, especially visuals, it blows 'Jurassic World' out of the water with ease - and it came out six years ago. There is no excuse for 'Jurassic World's poor CGI. Its' creators had the budget and the technology to make it better, but, alas, they chose to do a half-@$$ed job with it. And that is not the movie's biggest problem.This is just not a movie, it is a product, manufactured on an assembly line. There is not a single original idea in it - even its' title is made by combining the titles of the first two movies. The plot is almost identical to the plot of the first movie, but everything that made sense about it has been surgically removed. And this time the army is involved. The writing is incoherent, implausible and downright dumb. And, as I like to say, this is not an opinion, this is a fact. I won't spoil it, but parts of this product (as I said, I can't call it a movie anymore) are directly contradicting other parts. The acting is about as good as the writing. Yes, many good actors are involved here, but they aren't even trying. Chris Pratt is playing exactly the same character he played in 'Guardians of the Galaxy', but this time his character is written as if he is supposed to be an action hero like Indiana Jones. He doesn't have many comedic lines, and the dissonance between the way he is written and the way Pratt is playing him is just mind blowing - and not in a good way. Bryce Dallas Howard is a tiny bit better, but her character is just awful. Vincent D'Onofrio is an incredible actor, but he isn't given anything to work with here. I wouldn't even bother to mention the rest of them.As a whole, this thing works only as a comedy. You can laugh at its stupidity. I know I did. This is why I am so generous with the rating here. 'Jurassic World' is a 3/10 movie at best, but I am rating it higher, because it entertained me.",Jurassic World
385,tjgoalie13,"Very Entertaining, and Surprisingly Fun",8,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World is an entertaining time at the theaters, that uses a surprising amount of humor and depth to keep you interested. While Jurassic World is not as good as the original, not even close, it is a good movie in it's own right. As to be expected the plot wasn't very original, but take that with the grain of salt that going in you don't expect too much originality. That being said while not very original, the stakes in this film are higher than in the original, as the first film dealt with 15 or so people on the island, this movie deals with thousands. In the end I found the plot to have enough twists to keep me interested, the movie had a surprising amount of humor (including a hilarious Jimmy Fallon cameo), and an awesome climax.",Jurassic World

Red haired hot chick, muscular guy and a bunch of computer created dinosaurs based on Ice age 3 and How to train your dragon, and you think that is a good movie? I want somebody to return these two wasted hours of my life, or at least buy me a beer and popkorns. It started with annoying classical music, repeated some parts of the first Jurasic movie and included just absurd dinosaur training... Give me some good reason who and why directed and payed this movie to be released! I am sorry but this movie is completely waste of time. I have watched trailer and I decided to give it a chance. What a huge mistake! When you make a better movie call me, till then do not bother. I am sure dinosaurs should be ashamed of the way this movie shows them after all these years.",Jurassic World
387,thisseatofmars,Take another trip into Hubris World!,4,24 October 2016,"You'd think they would've learned their lesson the *first* time the dinosaurs went rogue in the first Jurassic Park. Then you'd figure they would've learned the lesson in the sequels, but no. They mention continually in ""World"" that cloning dinosaurs en masse in an enclosed space is a bad idea, but hey: we've got fences now!The twist in ""World"" is that they cross-clone dinosaurs. The star of this episode is the ""indominus rex"" (eye roll) which is basically just a bigger version of the T-rex from the first film. They give it the DNA of apex predator, long grabby arms, and the brain of Adolf Hitler--what could possibly go wrong?Chris Pine, an actor who got his start by playing fat fools, plays an American war veteran who also, somehow, is an expert dinosaur trainer (WTF?) who attempts to assert authority in the film with wise, wildman insight. At one point in tracking the ""indominus"" (jeez) they come across a dead dinosaur. Pine's character remarks, ""It's not eaten! The indominus is killing for sport!"" Oooooh, if we didn't hate the indominus before, we really hate 'im now. Being a genetic freak is one thing, but hunting for sport is just unacceptable.The movie continually reminds and tells us how 'cool' Chris Pine's character is: from the kids telling the female lead ""your boyfriend's a badass,"" to them asking her if they can stay with him. Chris Pine, however, is no alpha. He's a clueless git who happens to have a thick neck, and whenever he tries to strike a serious face he couldn't look more stupid. And none of the other cast have much charisma either. Except for maybe Judy Greer. (And the guy playing her husband seems more like an alpha than Pine.)There's kind of a novel twist on the formula halfway through where the dumb humans use dinosaurs as hunting dogs, but the way they run and are shaped makes them look like big chickens. John William's score is distracting and gets in the way, and the movie is a multicoloured mess.Avoid.",Jurassic World
388,ryanwinning1,Visually stunning!,8,1 July 2020,"This film is so visually stunning I feel obligated to score it 8/10 despite the worst script for a high budget movie I have ever witnessed. By ratio of budget to script quality it has to be the most atrocious. It goes without say the fine folks down at Universal Studios have a keen eye for breath taking visuals, but still have a lot to learn in human psychology and what constitutes realistic dialogue and dare I say ""They don't even understand basic small talk??"" Chris Pratt was phenomenal as usual, but after him the acting quality takes a massive nosedive. The only way I can possibly justify how this is possible is that Pratt had to be given some looser boundaries with how he was able to
Perform his lines vs the other actors in the movie and thank heavens the director allowed this. There is no other way you can explain how Pratt seemed so much more authentic and genuine than any of the actors in the film. Without Pratt's personality and improvisations which brought this movie to life it may have been just another generic robotic movie! If they can maintain the visual effects and improve the script for the future I think we have some great Jurassic Park movies coming down the pipe for the future!",Jurassic World

390,theemuhammede,Jaw dropping thriller,9,18 April 2016,"This was a great way to continue the Jurassic Park series. It took the dinosaur experience to a whole new level. Inside Jurassic World gave a much closer look to a variety of dinosaurs. It incorporated new innovative techniques such as hologram technology to provide a closer experience in the museums.The velociraptors were ferocious in their usual way. But they came with a twist. Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt, was a trainer for the velociraptors. He was able to establish a disciplined relationship with the velociraptors as humans do with dogs. There were a select few commands that Grady was able to teach the velociraptors and receive the desired action. Vic Hoskins, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, wanted to capitalize on this opportunity and militarize the velociraptors. That move was totally uncalled for and took away from the Jurassic Park experience.The Indominus Rex was not anything out of the vernacular. In comparison to the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Tyrannosaurus Rex is still the superior one in the food chain.Other than the attempt to militarize the velociraptors, this movie surpassed my expectations. It is definitely recommended for all of the Jurassic Park fans out there.",Jurassic World
391,SpoodermanDerp,The Lost Sequel,8,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World is the sequel that Jurassic Park deserved. Although still not as good as the first one, it's definitely better than the latter films. First of all, the characters in this film. Chris Pratt stars as Owen who trains rap tors, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and the two children namely Zach and Grey. For Owen and Claire, they had great chemistry and they were entertaining to watch for the most part in the film. The subplot of the two children which kind of parallels the two children subplot in the first film was more or less okay, it's understandable as in the first film it was stated that Jurassic Park's ""target audience"" were the children, and sure they were relatable to the children audience. But that was just about it as they were then overshadowed by the much more thrilling occurrences in Claire and Owen's storyline, although I'm not saying they didn't have thrilling or intense sequences, they sure had a ton of them. Then you have Chris Pratt as Owen along with Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire. Chris Pratt's character was the bad ass and ""alpha"" rap tor trainer and Claire was kind of like the person in charge of the park who happens to be nephews with the two children. Owen and Claire were entertaining, but it felt that something was missing. In the first film, the way Spielberg introduced each and every character in Jurassic Park was so excellent that we immediately liked and connected to them. You had the wisecracking and funny Dr. Ian Malcolm when he was first introduced and you had Dr. Alan Grant who when he was introduced, he was shown irritated with a child and then proceeded to burn him (not literally). So it was then fun to watch when Dr. Grant now had to cope with two children in Jurassic Park. It was just simple things that made us love the characters in the first film which in this one, did not really quite have that except for the chemistry between Owen and Claire and how the children in this film were very much relatable for it's target audience. The main thing people usually ""complain"" about is how it isn't ""scary"" like the first film. The reason why the first film was so intense and scary was because the tension and scare was only revolving around a few number of people. The issue with many films nowadays is that they'd rather have a larger scope of what's happening, but then the audience wouldn't know what would be happening if there are too much things happening. The great thing about Jurassic Park was because of this small amount of people that everyone can relate to and can provide much more suspense which gave way to intense sequences because the audience now has a clear state of mind as to what is happening and who are the characters that are in an intense situation. As for Jurassic World, the scope of disaster in this film is huge and it was intense at some points, but you gotta admit that the most suspenseful moments in the film was when there weren't a lot of people and it was only just Chris Pratt standing still while the dinosaur comes up close or when the two children are escaping the dinosaur. Speaking of dinosaurs, let's talk about Indominus Rex and just dinosaurs in general in this film. Firstly, the CGI in this film for the dinosaurs was great. Close up shots looked great and more or less there were no problems, practical effects thankfully used and the human interaction with the dinosaurs looked excellent. Now moving on to the Indominus Rex, she was indeed a menacing antagonist. She was an intelligent hybrid capable of tricking humans and killing for sport as introduced in the first few minutes of the film, yet as the film progressed, it kinda felt inconsistent and her skills and intelligence were undermined a little bit, but maybe it was just because she had quite a short to moderate screen time.The action and thrilling sequences in this film. As mentioned, the most thrilling and intense scenes are when there aren't a lot of people and you actually know what is happening. Now this parallels as well to the action sequences in this film, because the action was amazing and awesome for children granted, but when analyzing and actually watching it as a whole....it kind of felt dull. Watching the action sequences it kind of reminded me of Transformers and that's usually a bad thing, especially at the boss or final battle (no spoilers), that battle felt too convoluted and it cuts back and forth to the humans and back to the dinosaurs fighting and back to the humans again and back to the dinosaurs fighting. If you have an epic battle, you must emphasize on it or the battle sequence will feel convoluted and confusing as to what is happening. Now let's talk about the wonder and awe that this film contained that is crucial to Jurassic Park films (well except for the latter films), it sure had A LOT of call backs, references and parallels to the first film, and the John Williams score comes back which provides with a lot of goosebumps and memories back. We've seem dozens of other innovative CGI films in the past few years but this film will still give you a smile if not drop your jaw if you're a kid or kid at heart. Verdict: 8.0/10",Jurassic World
392,WooderIce64,Watered-Down Jurassic Park,4,16 June 2021,"There's been a trend emerging in Hollywood lately of sequels to long-dormant franchises that are strikingly similar to their predecessors to the point that they're essentially remakes packaged as sequels. Some examples include Force Awakens, Incredibles 2, and PotC: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Jurassic World is perhaps the worst offender of this pack. It follows a plot very similar to the 1993 classic that became one of the most popular movies of all time, and yet manages to fall short of it in virtually every aspect, creating a vastly inferior product.Jurassic Park was one of the last major blockbusters released before CGI became the dominant form of effects in movies, and its visual effects are still outstanding to this date. The effects in Jurassic World manage to be worse, even 22 years after the original. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park still hold up. These will look dated in no time. Spielberg's blockbusters from Jaws to E. T. to Jurassic Park are loved in part because of how real they seem. Not even the reuse of John William's outstanding score from the original movie can recreate that magic.While this isn't a good movie, it isn't a particularly bad one either, and it does have redeeming values. The two main characters, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), are fine. While their relationship is iffy, the performances from those two are good. The relationship between Pratt and Blue, even as CGI as she is, is well done. While the effects are inferior to the original's, they aren't that bad, and the original's are among the best ever made, so it's a high bar to begin with. Michael Giacchino, while he's no John Williams, does a good job. The movie has some good original ideas in it. The pod that they ride around in is an example. And while they don't stack up to the '93 movie, there are a few moments that invoke that horror element.All in all, the movie just feels like a soulless cash grab. I don't like to call movies soulless because of all the work that goes into them, but what else is there to say about this? It's a watered-down version of Jurassic Park that still managed to rack up $1.5 billion. And with ""remake-quels"" like this, Force Awakens, and Incredibles 2 racking in the billions, brace yourself for more on the way.Even the Universal Studios ride is inferior to the original. At least the original is still up and running in Orlando.",Jurassic World

394,moviescoundrel,Out of this World,7,12 June 2015,"The rationale for the velociraptors and the Rex is a bit sketchy. The velociraptors seem to have a loyalty to Owen, then they turn, then they turn back, and so forth. I felt like I was watching ""How To Tran Your Dragon 2"", except on a slightly less intelligent level. Also the Rex seems to have a hunting method of sniffing scent, at one point it can not smell Owen, but later it ends up sniffing and finding him and the girl many times. There isn't a lot of consistency with what goes on there.For me, one of the best segments of the film was when the pterodactyls escaped and went on a flying, snatching, and biting spree. Through the air, through the woods, and then through the crowds of people, it was quite fun to watch.Well the film is not brilliant, or particularly innovative, it is a decent time. Also if you have seen the first one, or saw it years ago in the theater like I did, it is quite nostalgic and I guess retro to experience a similar adventure, along with the same music that was played 22 years ago. I am not a big fan of seeing most movies in 3- D, but the 2-D showing was sold out so I ended up seeing the 3-D version. While it was not my first choice it was a good movie to see in 3-D as many of the scenes were breathtaking in that medium. As one of the first blockbusters of the summer, this film will make money, entertain audiences for the most part, and while it will be around for a couple months, it won't really be talked about in a year or two. If you like action movies, or dinosaurs, or Chris Pratt, it's definitely worth checking out.",Jurassic World

So then one of the Dinosaurs a Mother of a ...... escapes, and causes havoc. One of the creators ie the scientists is asked what components was created to make the dinosaur. They fail to answer the question, however it is then soon realsied that it is a Raptor. There were three Raptors that Owen(Pratt) was ""socialising"" or rearing, something like that. Then came along Claire(Howard) who is a sister to Karen(Greer) is asked to look after Zack(Robinson) and Gray(Simpkins), who is a Business woman and simply don't have time for both Zack and Gray.

Jurassic World.It wasn't on my Must See list but I had the chance to watch it for free so why not? I was hoping that maybe I'd like it more than I liked Jurassic Park but it felt like Deja Vu all over again.Starting out I was full of hope but as the movie went on I noticed I started losing attention.I had to rewind certain parts over & over again just to see what I missed.With about 30+ minutes left, I was ready to give up but I stuck it through because it almost over anyways.Just like with Jurassic Park I was BORED out of my mind.The nicest thing I can say about Jurassic World was the special effects were cool (I guess) After the movie was over I nodded right off for 10-15 minutes.Jurassic World was 2 hours, too long.In 2018, Jurassic World 2 is coming out & If I can see it for free, I'll be torturing myself all over again",Jurassic World

We humans exterminate animals in real life and even on film, we still feel obligated to kill them off at the slightest pretext. This series says something about humans and it ain't good. Humans kill. We kill *everything*. And then we pat ourselves on the back. I'm waiting for some imagination here and not seeing any. Same old plot, they changed the heads of the bodies is all. The animals still look the same, the labs still look the same, the jungle still looks the same and the island.. well guess what? It still looks the same. This movie series fixation with a dinosaur park is making Michael Crichton giggle in his coffin. Or his cold-storage nitrogen tank. Whatever. Hope he's still collecting his piece of the action somehow. No imagination, lots of money splashed all over the screen. Lots of ""lets keep it in the groove"" thinking. The producers must have gotten a few real belly laughs as the storyline tracks along about cynically keeping the park visitors entertained and distracted while doing just the same thing with the movie audience, manipulating them time after time, scene after scene movie after movie, to cough up their money again like the suckers they know us to be.

398,Sjhm,Has the wow factor with strong feelings of deja vu,7,11 June 2015,"I enjoyed the film, but after the long anticipation, the actual event was a little bit of a let down. Essentially, the plot of the 1993 original has been given a make-over. You have all the same characters, in slightly varying numbers, doing pretty much the same things which guarantee the same result. It is as though twenty-two years later, the makers of the park have learned nothing from the original disaster. Sequences of remarkably similar unfortunate events happen in the same way to drive the story forward.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do their best, but the plot is a thin thing to hang a maybe future romance, some in peril children (nephews this time), a lot of dino-action and a strange sub plot which has the curiously militaristic security of InGen relying on Raptors to chase down the park's newest out of control creation.I wanted to be thrilled, and sometimes I was. There were plenty of jump-scares, and the indominus rex is stunningly realised, but the sense of deja vu detracted from the overall effect.

400,A_Llama_Drama,Unnecessary Addition,5,1 July 2015,"Jurassic World sees the fruition of John Hammond's work come to life when, 21 years after Jurassic Park opened (and permanently closed) its doors, a new park is successfully up and running. Sadly, for all those involved, humanity is so bored of T. rex and velociraptors that attendance is down and so is sponsorship. Therefore, thanks to Henry Wu (B.D. Wong reprising his role from the original), the lab have created a monster to woo back guests and moolah. Obviously, much like John Hammond's first attempt at messing with nature, things don't turn out as they planned.Chris Pratt is a velociraptor trainer (what?) who is brought in to inspect the fence surrounding this new investment by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who just happens to have family visiting for the week who are currently going through a crisis. She's far too busy to hang out with her socially misguided nephews and dumps them with her PA. Naturally, they promptly run off. Owen, the trainer, is being wooed by InGen (remember them?) to use these trained velociraptors as weapons of war. The scene is set for carnage. Or is it?What follows is so mind-numbingly dull, obvious and really rather badly put together that you will be forgiven for believing you're watching a cartoon or magic show. The main issue is that, unlike its original predecessor (or even Lost World) it can't make its mind up if its family entertainment or adult horror. This new dinosaur has every ability to terrify and yet instead the characters are faced with these horrific situations in which they remain entirely stoic or consider with mild curiosity. Contrast that with the girl in the original wetting herself before she'd even set eyes on the T-Rex and then entering a fit of cerebral palsy when confronted by a bronchiosaur. Here, two children are brutally attacked and barely a minute later are having a wander around the old jurassic park site, enjoying the murals and technology on show. Not to mention having the wits to hotwire and refuel a car that's over 20 years old. If these horrific acts occur and the characters who are facing them don't care, why should the audience? Part of the problem is pacing. The Indominus Rex escapes 20 minutes into the film, we see it in all it's glory five minutes later and then for another 2 hours watch it tear the park apart. That is far too long a time to watch a set piece implode. Therefore scenes of exposition and moments of incredulity occur to further the plot and push the I. Rex towards the park. When it finally reaches the park, 20,000 guests seem undisturbed by the massacre occurring. One very nasty moment sees a woman repeatedly drowned and bitten by pterodactyls only to be eaten by a much bigger dinosaur and the characters watching do nothing but enjoy the show. Could they actually help? Probably not. Would they watch like it was an episode of Sex and the City? Doubtful, also. And the CGI... the CGI! Good God, the first thing you see is a CG bird and my first thought was ""obviously this is a simulation at the park,"" but no, this is real, this is a bird generated by computer graphics that is meant to be in the real world. Great to know that in a movie redolent with CGI that it is going to be rather bad. It really, truly is. No scope, not one iota of attention devoted to realism, this is a cartoon through and through.However, not all of it is bad. The dino fights are brutal and the few new ramifications for the park are wonderful to mull over and talk about after. Chris Pratt, despite playing the worst possible character ever (a velociraptor trainer?!?!?!) manages to remain charismatic and heroic. Bryce D. Howard is also compelling as a control freak watching her World be destroyed bit by bit. All in all, however, my advice is to go home, by the original on blu-ray or 3D, invest in a good TV and sound system and just scare yourself silly with the original. You'll be pleased you did.",Jurassic World
401,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,Ushering in the Future by Honoring the Past,7,23 June 2015,"Jurassic World is the rare sequel that pays homage to its roots while offering up plenty of thrills on its own. While the depth of characters leaves the most to be desired, I can't argue that the film is a tried and true summer blockbuster that lives up to the hype.The story seems to follow the 1993 original while none-too-subtlety kind of ignoring Lost World and Jurassic Park III. And you know what? I'm fine with that. We finally have the vision that John Hammond wanted to present - a fully functional theme park where dinosaurs indeed roam the Earth once again. A brand new multimillionaire, Simon Masrani (played by Irrfan Khan) now owns the park. It has made plenty of money over the preceding 20 years, but costs have also gone up. Thanks to head scientist Dr. Henry Wu (played once again by BD Wong - the same role he originated in Jurassic Park) the theme park has rolled out plenty of new ""attractions"" to keep the public interested.PR head Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) has just sealed a deal with Verizon to sponsor their brand new attraction to open up in mere months - the genetically-modified hybrid dubbed the Indominus Rex. But Masrani is a bit concerned about its security and calls on former Marine Owen (the always welcome Chris Pratt) to check things out before he signs off. Meanwhile, Claire's nephews (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) are visiting the park and are given over to her assistant to worry about while she is off on pressing business. Owen is also dealing with an InGen (remember them?) representative (an oily Vincent D'Onofrio) who is impressed with his work with training velociraptors (in hopes that is leads to the militarization of dinosaurs in the future). Rounding out the cast are Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus as two computer techs, Omar Sy as Owen's right-hand man and Judy Greer as Clair's sister.Introductions aside, none of these characters are really given more than a cursory personalty. It also means the ""romance"" between Howard and Pratt feels a bit forced and kind of extraneous. It's the main reason I have to bump it down a notch - that, and they spend too much time trying to establish these paper thin characters before moving on to the meaty aspects (and the dinosaurs).That being said, once we are finally introduced to Rex 2.0, all hell breaks loose and things never let up. We have dinosaur on human carnage, dinosaur vs. dinosaur carnage and plenty of running, jumping, dodging and lots and lots of deaths. In fact, I'm surprised they killed off as many people as they did. For a PG-13, I think they pushed things about as far as they could (given that the U.S. is more lenient towards violence compared to language or sex). It might be a bit much for the young kiddos, but I'm glad they didn't tone things down much.The reason I can endorse this whole-heatedly, however, is how much fun it was comparing it to the original. The cast lines up quite nicely with the original Jurassic Park crew (two kids, rogue, nice lady, rich guy, jerky guy you want to die) and not only are the characters reminiscent of the original film, but they actually go back to the original Jurassic Park at one point - and use John Williams' original theme to some nice effect. For me, it was a nostalgic look back while fully grounding itself in the now. I love the way its mixed old but still managed to keep things fresh.All in all, Jurassic World left me with a good feeling. While I really wish the film offered a bit more depth in the character department, overall and excellent summer blockbuster and one worthy of carrying on the Jurassic Park legacy.",Jurassic World
402,nmholland,"Highly Overrated, but Still a Very Fun Dinosaur Flick",8,9 March 2016,"Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow and is the long awaited sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy, especially after the bomb that was Jurassic Park III (2001). This movie takes place once the dinosaur theme park known as Jurassic World has been open and successful for some time now. However, people seem to be getting bored of dinosaurs recently (we'll talk about that later), so the park manager, a young woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), orders the genetic assembly of the most scary dinosaur ever seen, the Indominus Rex. Once this beast breaks loose upon the island, Claire, a raptor trainer named Owen Brady (Chris Pratt), and Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson) must try to defeat the dinosaur, while also trying to survive.This film is highly overrated. Coming out of the theater on June 12, the release day, I heard people saying it was ten times better than the first Jurassic Park (1993). Really? Better than one of the best movies ever made? I don't think so. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. This film is actually a very fun movie to watch. I enjoy it a bit more, in fact, each time I watch it. But it's not perfect.The best thing this film has to offer is the mix of special effects and dinosaur action. Every time a dinosaur got into a fight, whether it be with people or another dinosaur, look amazing. None of the special effects look fake at all. All shots of the Indominus Rex look very real, and never look even near bad. This even occurs towards the beginning, before any chaos is even happening . The action with dinosaurs is very abundant as well, and is directed very nicely. All action shots are very clean, and usually wide when CGI was in use.The worst thing this film has to offer is the subplots. One in particular is a certain character trying to militarize Owen Brady's raptors. Yes, there is a character wanting to make soldiers out of dinosaurs. This subplot is completely unnecessary and should've been wiped clean from the script. If this subplot didn't exist, the film would be much better. Another pretty useless subplot is background with the children. Not that the children are bad characters, but the back story with their parents and their home life could've been easily taken out of the film, and Jurassic World would've been better off.Chris Pratt. This man has truly proved himself as an amazing actor, after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and especially now after Jurassic World. There's been a lot of talk of Pratt portraying Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones 5, but I'm truly confident in him being this ever-so-loved character if that's the decision that is made. After the trailer hit, there's been a lot of talk about Bryce Dallas Howard, and whether or not she would do good in this movie. Well, she did. She was one of the highlights, equipped with a major character arc, and good on screen charisma. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson also did rather well, despite their characters not being all that interesting.This leads me into my next and final point, the characterization, especially of Zach and Gray, the two kids. Zach is the older brother of Gray, and actually has a pretty good arc within their relationship later on, but it takes a while for this to fully kick in, and that is a little frustrating. Their background, like mentioned before, is a useless subplot, and could've been removed altogether. However, both actors did pretty good, despite my expectations.Overall, Jurassic World was not perfect, and pretty overrated. However, it was very fun, thanks to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances, great visual effects, and very cool action. Jurassic World deserves a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",Jurassic World
403,fairlesssam,Really fun and exciting!,8,23 June 2017,"This movie is really fun, thrilling and exciting. Chris Pratt is superb, he rocks this movie. He is one of the animal rangers and is training the raptors to accept him as their alpha. The raptors as so cool, I love them. From the onset you know the park is doomed, there is an air of not 'if' but 'when'. The whole cast in the film are fab, they all shine and deliver tip top performances.There are some great additions to the Jurassic family including a genetically created very angry and very big dinosaur, a giant sea monster and a hamster ball attraction.For any fans of the franchise this doesn't disappoint, the special effects are breathtaking. The negativity surrounding this film is not surprising but if you are expecting reality why watch a Jurassic Park movie?!",Jurassic World

They are then attacked and the escape the gyrosphere, but when and how had the I-Rex remained in the northern part of the park after smashing the gate as we see the corpses of numerous brachiosaurs it has killed in the park and then it's north of the gate again at the original 1993 JP centre - it appears omnipresent!",Jurassic World
405,shivamt25,not satisfied....,6,12 June 2015,"Hey guys...! Have you seen Jurassic World yet ? I have and i think if you have seen the Jurassic park, the first one, you will be least impressed.Here is what i think of the movie. Jurassic World comes with all the clichés we already saw in previous editions. Obviously those things made the first one a masterpiece, they make this 'something we have already seen'. You remember those shots when they present a giant dinosaur, they focus on its feet and then slide fast hiding the body of the dinosaur and then a close shot of the eye, yeah i am talking about these shots. They were there back then, they are here now. Andi don't know why, in all Jurassic movies, kids doing the dumbest possible thing never get killed. Just joking, everybody love kids.Chris Pratt is no where near his performance for Guardians of the Galaxy. Bryce Dallas is surely someone to look forward to, and Irfan Khan has been on screen definitely more than i expected, that is good.So, if you want an experience like Godzilla (the new one, which i liked more, but they are kinda similar) where their are 'some' awesome shots with thrilling music and dinosaurs roaring (yes, only those were awesome when the dinosaurs were roaring) you can have a go at it. It maybe the case that you like it only on big screen. I think this could happen.",Jurassic World
406,randomStuff101,Corny generic cheese with some good action visuals,3,17 June 2018,"Why does Hollywood insist on highly implausible, cheesy rubbish. Why do they insist on making women look like tough heroic survivors, while wearing high heels and being the ""love interest"" during moments of panic and death?There's a scene where people are literally dying all around them, plucked from the ground by nasty flying dinosaurs, and instead of taking cover, the focus becomes a ""kiss"" between the hero dude and this woman, with her nephews watching on, concerned about who this man is. What the hell?Why insult out intelligence? Why sink to these extremely low cheesy levels? It's old, outdated lazy story-telling. Sure there's some decent action, but when you have truly implausible scenes mixed in, you become separated from caring about the story and consequences. It becomes another generic feel-good action with no heart, and no relationship with reality.Please Hollywood, grow up.",Jurassic World
407,capelladewdrop,Awesome tribute to the original,10,18 July 2015,"Honestly I don't see what all the fuss is about. Sexism? Racist because a breed of the dinosaurs are call ""Paki's"" for short? I guess some people just love to pick faults.I thought this movie was spectacular. I was too in too much awe to see anything wrong with it which a good movie does to you unless you really want to be disappointed.I was utterly convinced throughout the movie the dinosaurs were real. As soon as they said at the start of the movie they created their own genetically modified dinosaurs I knew there was going to be BIG trouble.",Jurassic World
408,peterdeluca-14183,Chris Pratt is awful,4,15 December 2019,Oh man. This movie was awful. Chris Pratt pays some weird Dino whisperer that lives in a trailer. There is odd product placement throughout. Story is more of the same. You would think they'd stop opening these parks!,Jurassic World
409,J-bot6,Not bad. Not great either.,6,22 February 2016,"I almost turned this film off during the first 20 minutes. The formulaic cotton-candy intro was a bit too much to stomach. Instead, I walked to the kitchen and grabbed some food. By the time I got back, the movie had started to gradually get on its feet.As it turns out, this is a film that gets better as it progresses toward the ending. There are a number of warm-and-fuzzy family moments where characters try to develop through talk. This would work better if it wasn't so obvious that this was the intention of these scenes. I guess if there's a word that describes this film, it's ""overt"".No surprises here. Pretty much what you'd expect from this series.On a hair and make-up note, I see that the same pink lipstick is being used on the men. To the departments and the manual that you're consulting for color codes, please be aware that WE CAN SEE THIS COLOR ON SCREEN. It's worth updating the color so that it isn't so obvious on both the big and small screen (unless the tranny look is what you're aiming for). This is the third high-budget film I've seen with this phenomenon.So yes, go ahead and watch this film if you liked the other Jurassic films. However, beware if you're into hard-core dinosaur films -- you might find this to be a bit fluffy.I enjoyed this more than the first Jurassic film. It's much better than the second movie. However, it's not as good as the third. So far, Jurassic Park 3 is the winner.",Jurassic World

The dinosaurs are bigger, better and have more teeth to satisfy the paying public. Trevorrow brought his dinosaurs to life in ways never before imaginable. The movie has plenty of heart, humour, excitement and suspense. Jurassic World is an entertaining and visually dazzling popcorn thriller.Rating: 8,2.",Jurassic World
411,alexcomputerkid,we now have a film that is at least acceptable compared to the original 1993 film and it is a long time coming,8,14 June 2015,"Jurassic Park was a blockbuster among blockbusters. Steven Spielberg made a film that was like no other in 1993 and still like no other now in 2015. Being that it was, you would have expected a sequel or a series prior to this. Being that it was Steven Spielberg, I would had high hopes for a series back then because we trusted him in a series before. He put together three excellent adventure films in Indiana Jones series. Still though, Lost World: Jurassic Park, the first sequel was OK but some issues were found. Even more, the third sequel was even worse and didn't have a very good story. Luckily, these sequels were forgotten and the original Jurassic Park from 1993 will always have the biggest impact. Now with a fourth sequel out, this is exactly the sequel we always wanted and this one will not be forgotten.Let's forgot that we've been hoping for this sequel for awhile. A fourth film was originally scheduled for a 2005 summer release and it eventuality took ten years to get through the cracks. The plot now has a dinosaur park opening and operating with living dinosaurs called Jurassic World. After her nephews Gary (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) come visit the island and her on Christmas break, Clare Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the park manger must save it from dinosaur attacks along with Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) a raptor trainer.In all honesty, the film premise is illogical. A dinosaur park is created where twenty years before one couldn't be opened because deaths happened and you couldn't control the dinosaurs. A multi-million dollar lawsuit should have happened and ended this forever. That said, the homage to the other park through this film is still clever even though again unlikely. Jurassic World though is one cool park even if admission is probably above anybody's price range but it is the coolest amusement park in the film world. From the effects that support the rides at Jurassic World to product placement, this film makes you want go to the park and that's what an amusement park in a film should do to you.Even more, so many theories are now out regarding these new characters and the Jurassic World universe. However you look at it, these are pretty neat characters. Claire has never been around to really care about her nephews and it's her time to impresses her sister. Owen is a blue-collar guy that has some really nice chemistry with Howard and really proves that Pratt can really play these roles after a handful of comedies from him. To think child actors would be leading this film is unsettling but Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson have no acting issues with a relationship between them that is exactly like my younger brother and I. Even Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as security operations guy and he's given more to do surprisingly. As much as I like Jurassic Park from 1993, I had issues with the action scenes. They look great and they were very simple which I like but they were unrealistic. Jurassic World action scenes are more in depth and you can sense the big budget that is somewhere in the $150-180 million market as reported. Still though, it uses nice ideas involving raptors that is original and uses the amusement park setting nicely. For the little ones, there is violent action but it's not like the other Jurassic Park movies weren't violent either.As I sat in the theater with a bunch of my brother's junior high friends who all finished the 7th grade literally an hour before the matinée, this is exactly a very good way to start the summer. A summer blockbuster that everyone could enjoy and it gets us set for the next blockbusters coming up in the upcoming months. More importantly, we now have a film that is at least acceptable compared to the original 1993 film and it is a long time coming. A good time indeed I had with this film.Note: The 3D version to the film which I saw should be avoided at all cost.",Jurassic World
412,Lele,I want back 60% of the money!,4,14 June 2015,"It was a mistake, but we had no choice because the movie we wanted to see was scheduled too late in the night.Now, I think that there must be a bureau in Hollywood where film-makers go and compile a form: ""I'd like to make a movie for children with (not too) scary but cool monsters. We have 150 millions $$$, 90% for special effects and 10% for the crew.""""Fill the blank. Please, specify if you want it PG or PG-13 rated""Then they put the request into a (obsolete) piece of software and get the screenplay.This movie deserves 1 for the acting, 0 for the screenplay, 6 for direction and 9 for special effects, audio and video.This was the bad new. The worse is that they have already planned ""Jurassic World 2 & 3"" and maybe more. Thrust me.The average is 4/10.",Jurassic World
413,RileyOnFilm,Pretty much like the first but way more magical effects,8,29 June 2015,"Fans of the original Jurassic Park are likely to love this one. There isn't much new in the way of a twist though. I remember the build up back when the first came out, people came out to the movie in droves. It really was like waiting in line for a ride. It was an original idea my Michael Crichton and everyone wanted to see the giant lizards. It was basically three things that made that movie popular: 1) The dinosaurs, 2) The action, and 3) the story. On all three levels I still give the first one a 5/5. This new one is good, very good. It is a rollicking rode for sure and worth the price of a ticket. At the same time it really lacks in the story department. I went in hoping to get something new and fresh that made me think about dinosaurs. In between the guttural dinosaur special effects, it just isn't there.Having said that, I doubt moviegoers really care about that. The dinosaurs and there, in full tech regalia. I've always thought dinosaurs were cool. I like to watch them but in real life they aren't there. I even think museum bones are a bit boring now thanks to this franchise. I felt the need to explain to my 8 year old that dinosaurs were extinct. It seems kids in the past 20 years have seen them so much on the silver screen, they seem real. I loved the movie, I offer no spoilers except to say you're gonna love the dinosaurs and the action. Some stories don't need to be improved upon, maybe that's what the makers of this Jurassic Park were thinking.",Jurassic World
414,Tyson14,Spielberg's vision brought full circle,9,22 June 2015,"As someone like many, who holds Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece quite dearly to my heart, you can definitely say I walked into this new installment/hopeful franchise restarter with equal excitement and nervousness. There's always a need to be cautious when a series returns to the big screen for the first time in over 10 years, but at the same time I love dinosaurs so the fact that I'd get to see them again roaring on the big screen was the real excitement. So does this revisit to this franchise live up to the hype? For the most part, I think honestly yes.I'll get this out of the way: Jurassic World is flawed. Like flawed as hell, there's absolutely no denying that. There are numerous sub- plots that could've easily thrown out of the movie and leave more room for the awesome dinosaurs, character development is mostly thrown out the window, when the humor misses oh it really misses with some flat dialogue to say the least, and there are plenty of story and script issues I had throughout. But, the most important thing I can tell you is that, I had a blast and smile on my face throughout which is what I wanted from this movie more than anything really.With every script issue this movie suffers from, Collin Trevorrow makes up for it behind the camera. ""Jurassic World"" is shot beautifully with some really impressive cinematography work from John Schwartzman, and while the CGI will not go down as groundbreaking for the blockbuster genre like the 1993 film, there are some remarkable effects here. But, mostly particularly to me this movie definitely manages to capture the tone, feel and spirit of a Jurassic Park film. Yes, it doesn't come anywhere close to capturing that sense of wonder or creativity that made the first film the special treat that it is, but Trevorrow does manage to capture some of the special essence I had when beholding that special classic, while also crafting some impressive world building. There's lots of callbacks made and nostalgia felt throughout, but Trevorrow never uses this as a pointless plot point to move the story along. Most importantly though, Trevorrow definitely proves himself to be capable of handling the action scale. The dinosaur sequences are of course the primary reason why you'd go to one of these movies, and the film delivers them in exhilarating, exciting, and pulse pounding ways. There's enough solid tension throughout, and the finale 20 minutes might honestly be my favorite climax of the year. Some seriously awesome stuff that I will not give away (who actually hasn't seen this movie yet? I felt like I was the last one to).Alright, let's talk about this pretty big cast. They're all pretty solid, especially given the weak character work they're given. Chris Pratt has been a rising star as of late, and for good reasons, because he proves here he wasn't a one trick pony with Guardians. He brings such a likability, charisma, and coolness to the character of Owen Grady that makes him such an engaging lead to watch. There's not really much depth given to this character, but Pratt knows how to be charming and bad-ass so he helps makes us become attach to him as a lead. Now, I've seen some complain about Jessica Chastain.... err I mean Bryce Dallas Howard here and I don't know why. Her character did annoy me a little at first with her uptight bitch persona (which we all know Bryce has proved to play those type of women so well), and again not much depth here, but she plays the character as well as anyone could (who else would run in those high heels like that?), and I did grow an attachment to her as a character. Maybe, it's because I thought she looked so stunning in this movie, but eh whatever. Her and Pratt, I thought made a believable team, but the romance angle could've been completely thrown out. Jake Johnson is actually quite amusing as the cliché tech guy, I really enjoyed his character, I just really wish there was a lot more of him. It was nice to see BD Wong again, and though their characters occasionally got on my nerves, with the whole emo teenager, I had no issues with Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson performances themselves. To my surprise and sadness, one of weak link of the cast was Vincent D'Oonofrio as the main human antagonist. This is really no problem with D'Onofrio, he plays the role as well as anyone could, he knows how to play an asshole well, but this was not just a well written villain at all. Right when he appears on screen, you know exactly where this character is going, and his whole motivations of wanting to weaponize these dinosaurs for military purpose made literally no sense. It's a shame, with such a underrated talent like D'Onofrio coming off such a incredible villain performance in Daredevil, they really could've made this a not so clear cut antagonist with reasonable motivations, but no his character is simply a pointless prick to just be a prick.All, in all, I'd be a fool if I told you ""Jurassic World"" was perfect masterpiece to behold. It's definitely not, there's tons of issues I can write about that I've already have, but I'd also be a fool if I told you I didn't find myself having a pretty damn great time throughout its brisk running time. For everything it does wrong, it does something else so right. It's big, loud, dumb, but still insanely fun summer blockbuster that Trevorrow manages to treat with plenty of charm and heart that definitely kind of help make me feel like a kid again.",Jurassic World
415,Geff,Jurassic World (2015),7,24 June 2015,"Firstly, the most important thing to me is that overall I was entertained. That doesn't mean that there were several things in and during the film that annoyed me. I had no idea where the twin Blutosaurus came from. The total disregard for the safety of the thousands and thousands of tourists on the island was totally sick. The casting all around was either wrong or could have been much better. Where have you gone Marion Dougherty? There are parts of the film that are ""dead air"" and should have ended up on the cutting-room floor. The ego-centric, ditsy, almost-stupid and incompetent park manager was a major annoyance. The hierarchy of the park is always in doubt as to who is really in charge. The toothasaurus was definitely in charge. The warning system was by phone: Hello. ""Houston, we have a problem."" Godzilla has escaped. And that brings up the idea I had that this would have been a perfect film for Godzilla to re-emerge. There were too many instances of humans outrunning sprinting 60mph dinosaurs. The macho-man hero, who really did nothing, accomplished nothing, and ended up subservient to the ditsy, irresponsible aunt-in-charge, was cast perfectly; too bad he did nothing. With all its shortcomings, it is still an entertaining film. With a better cast, a better script, a better super-monster, it could have been a real contender for eternal greatness (but it's not). One last note: I loved the (flying) Teradactyls! Again, I was genuinely entertained for the most part and the time flew by.",Jurassic World

It's obvious that this is just a cash-grab aimed at nostalgic fans. Forget about the interesting characters, incredible effects, and compelling story of the original... surprise, this is the opposite.
We couldn't care less about our protagonists, they're poorly written and mediocre performances don't help.
The script is so stupid that it's funny what happens on screen, at least you can laugh about it.
The effects are uninteresting, they don't help the action scenes at all, they're really tedious.

417,michael-3204,Slick and soulless,4,23 September 2016,"The most remarkable accomplishment of ""Jurassic World"" is demonstrating that it is possible for Chris Pratt to be a boring screen presence. Its most remarkable aspect, in general, is illustrating how challenging these franchise reboots can be. We have had a number of decent-to-excellent reboots in recent years -- here's a healthy reminder of how leaden they can be when things go wrong.There are a few good ideas buried in the film, especially the soft critique of corporate hegemony and its brand-everything mindset. It tries to have its cake and eat it too by incorporating the significant amount of product placement into this critique, thus attempting to make a virtue of necessity while it cashes the checks. This might have had more resonance if the film wasn't so soulless. The design of the world -- no longer just a park -- is a nicely conceived update of the original that allows for both visually stylish enhancements, like all the holographic projections, and plenty of visual callbacks to the original. Unfortunately, the latter just serve as several well- placed reminders of how much better ""Jurassic Park"" was. Jack Johnson's character, a coordinator in the central control room whose name I've already forgotten because he's so uninteresting, wears a t-shirt from the original park he bought on e-Bay and says how much he respects its legitimacy. This is another example of the film trying to insulate itself from obvious critiques. As with the product placement scheme, it doesn't really work as well as the filmmakers seem to think it does.One of the worst aspects of ""Jurassic World"" is that it takes the least appealing parts of ""Jurassic Park"" and runs with them, especially the sentimentalizing and anthropomorphizing of the dinosaurs. ""Park"" was guilty of this too, at least compared to the harder-edged, more clear-eyed novel by Michael Crichton from which it was adapted, but only around the edges and only in service of broadening the film's appeal in an all-ages direction. ""World"" goes whole hog in this direction, despite regular monologues and commentary from Pratt's Owen Grady, who is supposedly training raptors, that these are animals and should be respected as animals - - commentary the film repeatedly undercuts by depicting the dinosaurs as military strategists. The lack of faith the film has in its own ""assets,"" as Bryce Dallas Howard's corporate functionary who runs the park keeps calling the creatures, is the most depressing and cynical aspect of this whole enterprise, and left me wondering why I went to see a movie that trades on the wonder of dinosaurs while refusing to believe that actual dinosaurs would be wonderful.",Jurassic World

It's about a new theme park that finally realized John Hammond's dream of a dinosaur zoo; but because its now been open a while people are starting to get bored and so they create a new dinosaur mixing various DNA.Now let's start off with the good stuff. The world building is amazing, you go round this theme park and you believe this could be a real attraction, the way they show off buildings and exhibits its like a Disneyland promotional video so I really liked that. The whole look of Jurassic World was just really nice visually. Another thing I enjoyed was the new dinosaur itself, called Indominus Rex; it looked powerful, creepy and threatening every time you saw it; its abilities were also interesting and so it was great addition to the franchise and it contributes to my most favourite part of the film which was the third act - a real gem of a sequence in there. Of course, Jurassic World is a sequel and it knows it; although there were only a few references to the first film in the dialogue, and something special which I won't spoil, most of it's callbacks were through the music which sounded awesome. The soundtrack fits so well in the franchise its amazing, some of the beats, some of the instruments definitely were inspired to not only Jurassic Park but I think I heard The Lost World in there also which was fun. But the callbacks didn't stop there, which brings me to the negatives...Jurassic Park had a lot of iconic scenes and in Jurassic World it recreated one or two which gave you some nostalgia and you smiled at the obvious reference, but then it did it again, and then some more and it started to teeter on the edge of ripping-off; thankfully I don't think it did but I did have quite few moments where I noticed and was like ""Wait, that looks just like..."". So if you haven't seen the first film or not seen it in a long time, you might feel out of the loop when the shot builds to something you know should be important. Another thing that I wasn't a fan of was that there was too many characters; this film is flooded with various characters who all have their own back-story and B plot that it sometimes drags away from the main thing; the two kids for instance were given a line of back-story which was never touched upon again and the human antagonists were basically there to leave strands for a sequel. There was just a lot of unnecessary story.In the end, Jurassic World is a fun film. It's entertaining to watch but it just doesn't have the charm and wit of Jurassic Park, it tends to fall more into monster-movie somewhat which is fine, but just so long as you expect a cliché or two and some very cheesy scenes (such as catching a fly in mid air with your hand). But seriously though, it was great to go back to this franchise!",Jurassic World
419,keithlovesmovies,Jurassic World Review,8,2 July 2015,"Dinosaurs are still cool but not as surprising as the first time around. The technology definitely has improved over the years but the story remains the same (close to the first 2 movies). There are a few references to the first 2 movies but you don't really have to see any of the other movies to know what's going on. This movie feels more like a remake of the first film instead of an actual sequel.The movie starts off with a pair of brothers go on a trip to the rebuilt Jurassic Park (now World) to spend time with their aunt who happens to run the park. The story in the film is told from the perspective of the two brothers, the aunt just trying to hold everything together (which I will get to later), and the hunk dinosaur trainer guy. It's been 22 years since the first film and now that infamous island has a new park on it. The first glimpse of the new park involves a bright and vibrant opening that reminds the viewer of the first time they saw the original Jurassic Park, with a voice over by the late Richard Attenborough in introducing the park visitors and the audience of the wonders of the first dinosaur amusement park. Sort of a tribute to what the first movie was about and the realization of it coming true.Problems soon arise when, due to dwindling park attendance numbers, the park begins to start splicing the DNA of their animals in order to create a new attraction. Surprisingly enough, they manage to create a bigger, more aggressive, smarter dinosaur, the Indominus Rex. Being the type of film it is, this dinosaur finds a way to reap havoc within the park and cause problems for the film's protagonists. The film tries to act as a social commentary about the ethics and morality involved with cloning animals and whether or not they should be considered property or to be treated as living objects. The movie does not beat us over the head with this as most of the movie plays out as a creature movie where the stars of the film must merely try to survive the Indomnus Rex and avoid the destruction in its wake. The movie when compared to the first 2 is not as scary or suspenseful because the new dinosaur they have created for this film is simply not as scary and the way it is was depicted does not inspire suspense. While watching the film, I never felt a sense of danger as the stars never acted like they were in danger. Knowing what I do about the first 3 films, the story was rather predictable and did not innovate or further the series at all. This isn't the best movie I have ever seen but I was entertained. The performances of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard kept me interested (albeit a little cliché). Some of the ""family problem"" stuff, I could have definitely gone without and the film kind of took a little time to get going. Fans of the series will not be disappointed with this installment and for those who have not seen a film in this series will be entertained as well.keithlovesmovies.com",Jurassic World
420,baehr_adam,Pratt+Blackwater+Dinosaurs= A Masterpiece,10,13 June 2015,"OMG I don't even know where to start. I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to ""28 Weeks Later"" and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in ""The Lost World"". I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it. The final fight scene was Phenomenal.",Jurassic World
421,kieranbattams,Welcome to Jurassic Franchise..,8,20 June 2015,"My thoughts on Jurassic World have been so mixed for a while. Jurassic Park is a classic with sequels that really do not hold up, the trailers for this one were released and they didn't really set my mind at ease, so for a while i just sort of thought ""at least Chris Pratt is in it"". I hoped it would go down the Mad Max: Fury Road road ( that sounded weird) and for the most part it did. The film does a good job at setting you up for a nice nostalgia trip and when it started i felt like all my worries would be invalid.The plot is hard to explain and keep spoiler free but don't worry i wont give anything away. 22 years after Jurassic Park, a new theme park Jurassic World has opened. A new breed of dinosaur has been created from splicing two existing breeds together and manages to escape from its facility, Owen Brady (Chris Pratt) and the somewhat uptight Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) take it upon themselves to stop the terror from destroying Isla Nublar and everyone in it. The way i have described it makes the film seem very basic and to be honest, yeah it is pretty basic, but there are things in the film which need to be seen as a fan of the original. What i like about Jurassic World is that you can see the film without any knowledge of the others, yet seeing the original film is definitely a bonus. There are a ton of throwbacks to the events of Jurassic Park, some are hilarious and others feel a little shoehorned in and don't always work, but just know that they are very much there. From the moment that the doors open and we pan around Jurassic World with the iconic theme blasting out around us.. that is when we know that this film is more of a passion project than anything and it does a good job at being nostalgic. In this sense i will say Jurassic World is definitely the best sequel of the franchise.Chris Pratt as always is an absolute delight to watch. He takes this role like all of his others and makes it his very own. His character was very much an Indiana Jones type which makes the rumours of him playing Indy all the more exiting. I also never realised how hot Bryce Dallas Howard is until i saw this, as well as this she too does a great job and is a badass towards the end which made her so much more than the critics calling her a cliché uptight business type woman. After Daredevil it is awesome to see Vincent D'onofrio in anything but in this he felt kind of out of place and his character felt a bit wasted in my opinion, and ramping up the nostalgia again BD Wong returns as the only original Jurassic Park cast member and i found myself welcoming him back with open arms.The most important thing is arguably the dinosaurs here. When i saw the trailer they looked like they were a CGI mess and found that the animatronics from the original held up much better. I still feel the original dinosaurs did look better but the velociraptors really do look and feel like a real part of the cast and the new dinosaur introduce (Indominous Rex) was honestly a thing of nightmares. It was scary as hell and looked so cool, the design of it alone was nothing short of spectacular and every scene featuring it (there are a lot) was intense and had me on the edge of my seat because like the original, you never know who will survive this beast and posed more of a threat than most monsters in movies today.I will wrap this review up by saying that if you go into this film expecting a fun monster movie with some cheesy one liners and some brilliant action sequences then this film will please you. If you're a Jurassic park fan this will please you also. No it is definitely not as good and does have its fair share of flaws, but the climax sets the series in a new direction and it was a welcome one. Now having the biggest opening weekend of all time and a set up like that scream sequel. You know what? Im okay with that and with the return of the current box office king Chris Pratt i can see a whole new trilogy on the horizon. Mad max did it, Jurassic World did it.. don't let us down Terminator Genysis. You may have a ridiculous title but give us the nostalgia we crave!",Jurassic World
422,arnieiam,It's actually not as silly as I thought,7,16 June 2015,"OK it still was but there are some very interesting moments. This film is a mix of things, part Spielberg movie, part monster movie and part brainless summer popcorn flick.Let's start off as I usually do with the plot. Let's be honest, the first film had a lot subplots that went nowhere like the sick triceratops, the lysine contingency, the dinosaurs breeding and especially the stolen embryos. Sorry Spielberg fans.Here there is simple albeit a very cohesive plot. The park is now operational for many years but attendance is dwindling so they engineer a hybrid. The hybrid gets loose and chaos ensues. It does get silly however, especially in the third act with the velociraptors.So yeah, lets talk about the dinosaurs. From a technical standpoint, the CGI it....sucks. The first two films had such gorgeous digital dinosaurs because the animators used a lot of computing power to produce altogether 4 minutes of shots. They got the lighting and the physics right and they were only used in wide shots. In this film they are ugly, pasty, floaty and cartoonish looking things. Also they seem to behave more like movie monsters than animals. The velociraptors are supposed to be intelligent, I get that, but its supposed to be in the sense of opening doors and cornering their prey and not in the sense of communicating with Chris Pratt and what happens in the third act.Then the human characters. They are all very one dimensional. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard's character, no one else seems to have a story arc, again something the first film did really well. Chris Pratt is basically Muldoon but he just espouses Legolas like commentary like 'she's killing for sport' which is very insulting to the audience's intelligence. Bryce Dallas Howard is this uptight corporate person who wears high heels throughout the entire movie, even during chases scenes. Vincent D'Onofrio is this military industrial complex guy who wants to weaponize dinosaurs- yeah you read that right. BD Wong who had one scene in the first film returned for a much more expanded role here.Then we have the two kid actors who are supposed to be Lex and Tim. And oh god I hated them. This was one of the more futile attempts to make the film more Spielberg-ish and no, let Steve handle child actors from now on. Among all this silliness though there are unusual flashes of brilliance. What am I talking about? I actually saw some of the themes, motifs and imagery of Michael Crichton's original novel. The original novel went at great lengths to describe unstable systems and chaos theory which sadly the original film just glossed through. In the novel the park was said to be an unstable complex system doomed to fail by Ian Malcolm, then Nedry shuts off the power. In the film it shows Nedry being more or less responsible. In this film its actually more subtle when we hear the guy from Let's Be Cops hint at it and we see the Indominus Rex destabilize the park.Also the death scenes are very akin to Crichton's book. For a PG-13 film there is a lot of blood spatter. However there was this one death that was in very poor taste and I felt should've weighed in on the characters a bit more but no. And that's what I meant when I said this more or less is a brainless film.I still think the movie is pretty silly overall but whenever it goes away from being a Spielberg wannabe and a Michael Bay film, it actually has its moments. It will never be as good as the first film, hell even the second which I actually liked but it more than surpasses JP3 as it does manage to capture the theme of Man vs Nature again pretty well.",Jurassic World
423,russellingreviews,"A good re-boot, but same old story",7,18 June 2015,"Oh, yeah, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming. - Dr. Ian Malcolm (The Lost World) Walking into the cinema... The original is considered a classic, but the sequels were forgettable. 22 years later, can this storyline resurrect itself or should it have remained buried? Cinematic rating: 3 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 3.5 starsSee if you have heard this story before: scientists make a new creation out of things they have unearthed from the ground. These new creations seem good at first, but begin to turn from the power of their master and turn to terrorise the local community. Most of the people run away from these monsters, but the hero must stay and either save or destroy the monsters. Familiar?Throughout literary and cinematic history, from Frankenstein to Jurassic Park, mankind has been running from his creation. Twenty-two years after the groundbreaking film, Jurassic Park (and two forgettable sequels), we stay within the monstrous tradition and are re-introduced to the dinosaurs of Jurassic World. A fully-functional dinosaur theme park that inhabits the island of Isla Nublar. The vision of John Hammond has come to fruition, but there is trouble in this Jurassic paradise. The park has been in operation for ten years and attendance is declining. The corporation who oversees the park wants to develop dinosaurs that have the 'wow' factor. In creating bigger and 'badder' dinosaurs, what could possibly go wrong? The question that has to be asked at the outset of this review is 'what does Jurassic World provide that you cannot get from the original?' The answer: Bigger villains, more teeth and Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy). Understandably, technology has also changed over the past two decades and the special effects are pretty incredible, but the value added comes down to the terror factor of the new dino-villain, Indominus Rex and the appeal of the hero, Owen. Both of these distinctions deliver something new that is worth watching. The multitude of new dinosaurs and the adapting villain provide the necessary terror. It cannot match the originality of Jurassic Park, but it delvers the necessary fear factor expected in coming to a Spielberg-inspired creation. Also, with the inclusion of heroic central character, there is now an Indiana Jones-type foe for the newly created meat eater. Pratt manages this role well and provides the cockiness and humour needed for this popcorn adventure. Bryce Dallas Howard (The Help), Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi), BD Wong (Focus) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black) provide all of the necessary characters to give the story depth and ultimately the bridge for the inevitable sequel. It will not go down as a cinematic triumph, but director Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) provides enough new ingredients and includes enough nostalgia to make you want to come along for the ride. The ending is completely unbelievable, but we are dealing with a story about a Disney Dino-world, so suspend all disbelief and hold on for an entertaining visual experience. Similar to 2015's Ex-Machina, Jurassic World opens the discussion of mankind tinkering with the original creation. Striving for new scientific breakthroughs should be encouraged, but the bigger considerations could be in relationship to the original plan for this world. In a story like Jurassic World, making subtle changes to the original creation seems to lead to disastrous conclusions. The precise nature of this world seems to leave little to randomness. So, if that is the case, could there be consideration for an ultimate designer to it all? Take time to think about it and maybe even read up on it, but in the mean time, allow yourself to go have some fun at the cinemas with Jurassic World. Leaving the cinema... Jurassic World had enough 'wow' factor to justify it being re-booted. It was unbelievable, but enjoyable. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What can we know about creation? (Genesis 1-3) 2. Can we solve our own problems? (Proverbs 3:5, Philippians 4:6) 3. Why do we need a saviour?

424,Wirxaw,Dumb and stupid spliced together,4,29 October 2015,"I really thought movies like Godzilla, Transformers 4, Prometheus, Hobbit - can't really get worse. Like, they are the pinnacles of ""how you should not direct\write"". I was wrong... This movie... this is the TRUE Jurassic Period. Even Gravity is probably less barbaric. The only creature on our good planet that would suspend disbelief for this movie... is probably a sponge. Only a sponge would be able to take in that much... liquid.Where to begin...Oh, well, with positive. Howard and Pratt really kicked the rear end there. Cheesy, perhaps, clichéd - but, damn, those are the actors. They deliver. Unfortunately... they can't two-man a 25 man raid.The story begins with a dysfunctional, mental and unbelievable token family that establish the plot: kids aren't coming back. Really, in our good world, parents must attend before a child can ride a freaking roller-coaster. Yet in Jurassic - the lovely parents would leave their kids, knowing that their sister is some CEO and that one of the kids is retarded and that they will play with dinosaurs. Right... This family, these two kids... they will make the movie more horrible and painful to watch that the dwarfs of Hobbit, than the religious skank of The Mist... Seriously, every time the story gets back to these kids - you WILL want them eaten. Because they bloody deserve it. They ruin every last bit of atmosphere the movie tries to build.Then we get what... Well, this Park is probably one of the most expensive places in the world, not to mention importance etc. It's guarded by fat dumb white trashes who you wouldn't trust to guard an empty parking lot at night. It's crewed by skinny scaredy shrimps that you wouldn't employ in McDonalds. It's overseen by some asocial ""scientists"" who are one of those ""secondaries"" who you won't remember even if try to. It's protected by some 20-30man shady task force that desperately wants to ""let Godzilla fight"". It's owned by a distant and mentally handicapped cousin of Tony Stark. Who thinks that shutting down the park would make it more unpopular than having a mass manslaughter occur there. And who tries to combat pilot a civilian helicopter without license. Seriously, they could as well show Paris Hilton driving...Between everything said above, you will easily recognize ""Aliens"", ""How to train your dinosaur"" and... Terminator 2.Seriously. I'm being super frank here. Ice Age 3 is 95% the same movie. Just shot much better. And that's the worst Ice Age to date.Spoilers away, the whole plot is: ""Stupid family makes sure the movie feels relevant. Starlord and Howard make sure the movie has action. Fat pussy guard has the authority to open the most secure gate on the island. Stupid kids make sure the movie has unbelievable exposition scenes. Mad scientists pretty much announce the sequel. The evil bad Dinosaur takes down bigger dinosaurs, more defended dinosaurs, two spec-ops teams and even the T-800... I mean T-Rex. Like, really, that T-Rex lies there with pretty much torn throat. Then ""he is back"" and, together with a wee superraptor and Starlord - they make sure Godzilla stays fed. That had to rouse some hormones and call the happy end.""So in conclusion: The movie is less original than the Avatar(and that's saying something). It will make you cringe every time you see the personnel or the kids. It will make you think that Gravity has sense and logic.AAA titles can't be ranked 0, so here's 4 stars for the CGI and for the two main characters. They deserve it.",Jurassic World
425,the-fearless-america,Mediocre Creation with a Huge Potential to be Bigger Than What It Used to be !,4,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World is one of a long awaited movie in this year. Especially for Jurassic Park fans and old time generation people (which live in jurassic park era). With great trailer but seems to fail to satisfy people when the movie shot the theater.I should say that this movie have many ways to expand better. But unfortunately the director's lack of experience was made this movie nearly unmagical and less catchy. My conclusion is the script, storyline, acting (except Pratt), was a medium range.A failed using of CGI with an intention to give magical expression to viewers was a huge mistake. Spending so many budget for a hope to give a magical things like spielberg did. The only scene which impress me only when mossasaurus's appear, besides that it was empty. But we already seen that mossasaurus in trailer right, too bad i got no surprise.A wide range of actors also made this movie low-rated. Trevorrow's intention was wanted to lower the budget and increasing the movie's popularity in some region. So he cast vary actors from many regions. But it were all failed. Nothing giving a marveolus perform with a drama-force sci-fi film, even the leading role herself (Dallas Howard). Maybe it's only because of lacking experience. I hope he grow someday to be better.No such magical sensation, with mediocre performance from actors and actress. Drama-force sci-fi storyline with an intention to develop a connection between dinosaur with humans. Jurassic World was lacking things that only Spielberg can bought to. It was called Magic !",Jurassic World

There is no emrgency training, no worst case scenario. It is crap!",Jurassic World
427,BiiivAL,Nice film),8,7 June 2018,"Twenty years ago, people decided to play with evolution and resurrected long-extinct species. The amusement park, where the main attraction was dinosaurs, was to be a hit, but became famous for its tragic deaths. After a while people decided to give a lucrative idea a second chance, and here appeared the ""World of the Jurassic period"", offering visitors an unforgettable family vacation. But how much safer is it than its predecessor?Return to the big screens of great and toothy was just a matter of time. The story was too good to leave her alone. Inspired by a new life entrusted to director Colin Trevorow, who himself is a big fan of dinosaurs. He decided to show how he could bring the insatiable and out-of-control desire of humanity to be constantly entertained. In pursuit of money and new impressions, they bring out a new species, never before stepped on our planet. What can go wrong?The characters of the film, especially as for those who work in such a dangerous amusement park, where accidents happen all the time, are mostly too careless and narrow-minded. The owner of the island does not know at all what is being deduced in his laboratories, the security system operates only when the animals behave decently, one wants to write down as a matter of fact the wild raptors to serve in the army, and children can easily escape and during an alarm to stay alone on the field among dinosaurs, because the employees of the attraction are too busy saving their skins and incompetent to the limit. And what to do, when a huge dangerous predator of a new breed escapes, nobody knows at all.Well, that on the island works a certain Owen, who almost only understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not toys. Chris Pratt's play here is pretty plausible, especially its interaction with the raptors. In the light of rumors that he might become the new Indiana Jones, it was nice to see him in a similar image, which he is very much following. The Pratt company is Bryce Dallas Howard, for whom this is the next vivid role after the ""Servants"". She has her own moments and potential, but it feels like the writers specifically held her back so that she did not become equal with him, preferring to keep her heroine in the shadow of Owen. By the way, the only actor from the original was BD Wong, who again embodied Dr. Henry Wu.""The world of the Jurassic period"" is clearly aware that it is simultaneously the continuation of the original, and the restart of history, which should breathe new life into the franchise. To the very original, creators reacted almost with sacred trembling, references to ""Park"" are found throughout the entire film. There is even a character-geek performed by Jake Johnson, who seems to be the embodiment of the fandom.Steven Spielberg, of course, put his hand to this continuation of his prehistoric brainchild, but only as an executive producer. Together with Trevorow and the huge team behind the creation of this blockbuster, we are going to an island where many would like to visit, despite the deadly danger in its cages.The dinosaurs themselves on the screen impress with their realism. When raptors appear, it's like seeing old and almost kind friends. With them, there are a lot of great moments, in particular their communication with Owen. Their joint pursuit, depicted on the poster for the film, is one of the most exciting moments of the franchise. But the most impressive episode is the final battle of dinosaurs. I was delighted with who the writers were instructed to save everyone from the new predator. The original is always steeper than any remake.Continuing 2 hours, this adventure will not let you get bored and will please the dinosaur lovers, who opened their mouths with surprise and delight at viewing the ""Park"". The plot of ""Peace"" is based on the idea that formed the basis of the original: people played in the gods. Heroes again create what they can not control, and then pay for it. It would seem that it is time for mankind to learn from its mistakes, but, judging by the history, we often do them again and again. And the creation of dinosaurs is far from the most serious of them.Crossing the types of the most dangerous dinosaurs, it is worth to be prepared for the fact that family rest on such an island will turn into a chase for survival.",Jurassic World

All these negative reviews are actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it. I'm a die hard fan of the jurrasic parks and maybe because I loved all the other films so much this was just brilliant it brought me back to my childhood made me remember why I loved them films so much there so exciting and entertaining and it makes you feel all the emotions.

429,Blazehgehg,"A decent movie, but still not as good as the original",5,31 October 2015,"Jurassic Park was a movie that tried to be a lot of things. It wanted to be intelligent, it wanted to be heartfelt, it wanted to have a sense of mystery and wonder.Jurassic World is not that kind of movie. Instead, it feels like it's a robot's understanding of what Jurassic Park's ideals are.Nothing about this film feels natural. In the original Jurassic Park, you had great character moments, like Ellie and Alan's tension over wanting to have children, and how that evolves over the course of the movie. Jurassic World vaguely gestures at some tired, generic personality traits, and figures that's good enough. She's a hard-nosed business woman who learns to stop neglecting her family, he's a rugged modern cowboy with a heart of gold, and a pair of brothers bond despite their age difference. It's basic film 101 stuff, the sort of thing you'd see in a forgettable Hallmark Channel made-for-streaming movie, and nobody ever feels more human or nuanced than this.The end result is something that feels processed, manufactured, and factory-made. Maybe not the worst thing in the world for a film, but not interesting or unique. Just the next thing off the assembly line.That being said, at least the action in Jurassic World is pretty decent. The dinosaurs still look cool, and it makes the most of its two-hour run time to show you a lot of them. At the time of its release, this movie might've actually had the highest dinosaurs-per-minute ratio out of all of the Jurassic Park movies. The explosions are big and the creatures are bigger, and that part is still fun.But I couldn't shake the overall feeling of cynicism. Even the movie itself spells it out: Dinosaurs, it claims, are boring now. The public just wants scarier thrills, and louder roars. Jurassic World delivers, but at the cost of its soul. It's ironic in a sense; it's almost as if the movie suffers the same failings that the real Jurassic Park itself would.A movie that was made without anyone considering whether it should be made. Profit and franchise potential above all else. They stood on the shoulders of geniuses just so they could slap it on a plastic lunch box. A product, nothing more.I don't regret having seen Jurassic World, and I don't hate it. But Jurassic Park was a movie I could watch over and over again, and love every single time I saw it.Jurassic World is not a movie I have any immediate attachment to, or desire to re-watch any time soon. It exists, and it was not terrible. That's about the best endorsement I can give it.",Jurassic World

We meet new people and see new dinosaurs that we never saw in the original trilogy.The movie has the same sense of humour that the original movies had.

432,prospectus_capricornium,Works Best With Jawdropping Visuals,7,10 June 2015,"Once the obstreperous mayhem roars across Isla Nublar, there's no telling whether a chance for you to escape is going to gape into view, or you just run away from the pursuing carnage. These harrowing dangers, and imminently omnipresent threats in JURASSIC WORLD scream in deafening volumes, enough to keep the awe- inspired spectators glued on screen for more than two hours.The movie picks up two decades after the infamous Jurassic park shut down, in the wake of a horrendously bloody catastrophe that swept through the island. A new company has taken over ownership of the park which has been fully operational and open for tourists, only it's been seeing a steady decline in audience attendance. At the request of park's geneticists, a new hybrid, called Indominus Rex, which actually resembles a T.Rex, is created. Frankly, there's is not much to dig in the movie's proved-tested but overly familiar set-up. Cliché and predictabilities scream along the ever impending terror, but that terror itself holds enough charm to cover such narrative defect. The jawdropping cinematography employed to capture the screaming raptorial outrage is unmissable. Once the hybrid escapes, terrific camera-work follows its rampage and delivers an avalanche of eye-popping bloody visual spectacles. There are plenty of riproaring sequences, that include deadly chases and battles for flesh, enough to pull your attention away from fully gauging the depth of human emotions, that the film barely relays to its audience. This isn't to say there is really nothing to expect from that department, because as its emotional core, lead actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas-Howard, charm their way through their thinly-structured (mostly two- dimensional) roles. Chris Pratt, being the central hero here, has the striking charm and sarcastic demeanor he needs, to pull off his character, while the rest of the supports engage with either nothing or no more than forgettable acts.JURASSIC WORLD works best once its CGI dinosaurs begin raging on screen. It's a visual bloodfest, teeming with sense- cracking fight setpieces that get more intense toward the movie's roaring final sequences. I'm not really a religious fan of this franchise, and I'm not claiming to be a credible source of comparison between this installment and the past entries of the franchise. But based on what I've seen here, and in so many similar creature movies in the past, I'd say JURASSIC WORLD, is a solid addition. 7/10",Jurassic World
433,MovieDude1893,Little life finds its way into this lousy sequel,4,17 June 2015,"Remember the scene in the original Jurassic Park where the lawyer gets eaten while cowering on the toilet? Of course you do. It's a fun little moment. But it's also an easy joke and a sour, callous moment in a film that otherwise is pretty respectful of the life and death stakes at play in its scenario. Well, the makers of Jurassic World, mad little scientists of cinema that they are, take all the narrative DNA of the original film they can get their mitts on and pump in a whole lot of the toilet scene DNA to fill gaps in the chain and beef it up to modern standards. The resulting film is occasionally enjoyable on the lowest level of sensation, but mostly an onerous exercise in empty spectacle devoid of wit or humanity.Despite the lip service this pays to Spielberg's comparably towering original, this new dino epic inverts nearly every element that made the first entry work so well and endure to this day. Chief among this is the original film's absolute love of science. Yes, the ultimate message is the danger of science overstepping its boundaries, but our main characters were two paleontologists and a mathematician. Here we must settle for Chris Pratt's ex-Navy man (I never thought a film could put me in the position of finding Chris Pratt unlikeable, but here we are) and a host of faceless paramilitary jug-heads. The strain of militarism runs deeply in the film (despite its pretensions otherwise) and combined with a general lack of humanity forcing me to the point of outright rooting for every human to be gobbled up whole and never heard from again.Colin Trevorrow, likely in a misguided attempt to apologize for not being Spielberg, throws limp dick semi-satire all around the periphery to no real avail. It's telling that this film cues up John Williams iconic theme with shots of a theme park thoroughfare dotted with corporate logos. Hey, Starbucks. 'Sup, Brookstone. Hiya, Samsung. Hang loose, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville. For all its hip po-mo posturing, this is an oppressively imagination-free affair, a sponsored dinosaur of a film, Comcast/NBC/Universal Pictures Presents Nostalgia Tinged Blockbuster 2015.In his 1993 review of Jurassic Park, Ebert lamented that film's lack of awe and wonder. Perhaps he was right, but there was genuine terror and at least a cursory streak of humanity. The only such sensations dredged up by Jurassic World are a blood-thirsty cackle here and there. The problem isn't that the film appeals to our most base instincts, it's that it fails to satisfy them fully.",Jurassic World
434,wlee08,"Riddled with clichés, zero character development, and nonsensical plots, but what did you expect from a ""Summer Blockbuster""?",6,11 June 2015,"It's always nice to see Vincent d'Onofrio, but even his high caliber acting skills can't save what amounts to a very nonsensical plot. He plays the military liaison with a vested interest in using velociraptors in the military - you know, to carry out missions in dangerous war zones. It's hard to say it with a straight face, so we're obviously dealing with talented actors. Usually angry dinosaurs alone are sufficient when it comes to creating suspense, but this would require some decent writing, and seemingly incapable of this task, the writers decided to create a genetic hybrid monster-type dinosaur to try and elicit some emotion (although he is not a great deal scarier than the original T. Rex). I found it really challenging to care about any of the people who are trying to avoid getting eaten - despite the expressions of panic on their faces - and the frantic calls to the nanny. Some of the expressions of brotherly love between the children was well done, and, in line with the concept of ""summer blockbuster"" you certainly get your share of big bad beasties. There were also a couple of excellent comedic exchanges with the secondary characters working the control room.",Jurassic World
435,BillSims28,"Five-word Review: Wonderfully Nostalgic Fun, Entertaining Blockbuster",6,26 June 2015,"1993's ground-breaking Jurassic Park is a film of might and magnificence, and is one of my favourite films of all time. The two sequels were, in a word, disappointing. The Lost World had some good moments (the long grass) but was just so stupid at times (I've attempted to burn the memory of 13-year-old gymnastics vs. velociraptor out of my brain.) Jurassic Park III had fewer good moments. So, after all the rumours throughout the late-2000s of a Jurassic Park IV finally resulted in the announcement of Jurassic World in 2015, I was pretty excited if a little tentative. Then came casting announcements and trailers and I, like the rest of the contacted peoples of the world, like Chris Pratt after Parks and Recreation, The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. In addition, more great actors were cast like Bryce Dallas Howard of The Help, Irrfan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire) and Vincent d'Onofrio, so fantastic recently in Daredevil.But how was the actual film? The answer is: pretty damn great. Having grown up watching and loving Jurassic Park, I was ready to appreciate every moment of nostalgia and call-back to the original film (emphasis on the lack of plural on original film.) And there are plenty of such moments, such as the way John Williams' incredible, timeless score is heard in Michael Giacchino's well-adapted new score (the first time those first four eerie, haunting brass notes of the original theme play in this film made me grin in delight.) The triumphant theme is first heard when panning over the real Jurassic World, a decision which was met with negativity by some but for me was wholly appropriate and nostalgic enough to warrant shivers when seeing the park, now fully open and (initially) functional. The visual effects are top-notch, rendering a terrifying Indominus Rex as the monstrous hybrid antagonist, a jaw-dropping Mosasaurus devouring a whole shark like a fish finger and a pteranodon attack which is far superior to how they were utilised in Jurassic Park III. Bryce Dallas Howard is a good surprise in this film. Though the bankable, popular Pratt was at the forefront of the marketing campaign (and with good reason! http://tinyurl.com/q4e84hl) it is actually Dallas Howard who is the main character of Jurassic World, in my opinion. She holds up well, despite an insistence on wearing high heels for the film's duration. The only returning actor is BD Wong, reprising his role as Dr Henry Wu from Jurassic Park in a good role. The child actors are decent and luckily not irritating, rounding off a cast that is good, even if talented actors like Omar Sy and D'Onofrio don't have sufficient character development. The main problem with Jurassic World is probably the flat script, with dialogue lacking in any inspiration or quotability. Luckily the actors portraying the characters are likable enough and their characters generally sufficiently interesting to tie over scenes without prehistorically-induced destruction. Pratt doesn't appear until quite a while in, but it's a supremely cool introduction. The raptors are great in this film due to their relationship with Pratt's character Owen, who has developed their relationship to the point of mutual respect, but it does end up (without spoiling anything) that raptor attacks occur and the way they are done is fantastic - even better than the long grass sequence from the Lost World but not quite as spine-chilling as the kitchen scene from Jurassic Park. Overall Jurassic World is highly entertaining and will make for 2 hours of great fun which doubles as brilliant nostalgia for anyone who grew up watching Jurassic Park and its sequels. If you don't expect a cinematic masterpiece on the level of Jurassic Park and you can get over some poorly-written dialogue and character decisions, you'll have a great time. 8.1/10",Jurassic World
436,MVictorPjinsiste,Bryce Dallas Howard,6,7 October 2017,"I picked up this movie because I did like the first one at the time I was studying computers, and because I was bored a little. What I discovered is Bryce Dallas Howard.As soon as she appeared in a scene, I had a hard time concentrating on the story, that pathetically resembles the first one. Her delicate complexion, low voice, big eyes and chiseled features stole all the thunder from the elaborate, sometime downright ridiculous dinosoroid contraptions. I almost forgot about the annoying older kid and longed for her return on screen, sweaty and brave.A must if you are a refined redheads aficionado. Also if you are an unconditional of the first movie, since this is essentially a remake. Oh, I absolutely love Laura Dern, but seeing Bryce Dallas Howard in this movie was redemption to me.",Jurassic World
437,bonniejoy-978-68763,Why Can't I Hate You?,9,4 September 2015,"When I went to the movie theaters, I was preparing to hate this movie for these reasons: 1) Jurassic Park has already had two awful sequels, what makes them think this would be any better? 2) Almost nobody from the series was in this film 3) The plot would be horribly predictable: everything starts out smoothly, someone goofs, and dinosaurs are on the loose eating people. Yet in spite of that, this movie was incredible! I'm not going to tell you what the plot is, because it literally is what I've mentioned earlier: ""everything starts out smoothly, someone goofs, and dinosaurs are on the loose eating people"". I kept trying to hate this movie, but because of the John Williams music, actors, settings, special effects, and dinosaurs I found I could not. However, there were two major problems that bothered me about this movie: 1) That ""I'm the obvious bad guy"" character. (Groan!) It's annoying to see that kind of villain who is all about money, fame, and has no other personality other than that he's the obvious bad guy. Why couldn't we just have the dinosaurs vs the people? That's the only thing Jurassic Park 3 got right; we didn't need a forced bad guy. I think dinosaurs chasing people would have been enough of a conflict. 2) The Indominous Rex. I don't hate it, I love the design and that it's part raptor. But my big complaint is why the scientists felt that all the other dinosaurs were boring so they felt the need to computer generate one. I'm pretty sure seeing a live T-rex, triceratops, or stegosaurus would have been enough of an amazement. Everything else I love! In spite of some plot holes, those two complaints, and why a woman can run from a 30-miles an hour T-rex is possible, this movie is amazing. I hate to give spoilers out, but what makes this movie amazing is the final confrontation where it is Indominous rex vs Raptor working with the T-rex and the Mosasaurus! (Just saying that makes me need to pause and catch my breath!) The entire scene was awesome because: 1) You cannot expect to make a Jurassic Park movie without a T-rex 2) The last film killed the T-rex. It felt like she resurrected (especially when she knocks over the bones of a spinosaurus) 3) The dinosaurs were sworn enemies, and here they work together to kill the Indominous! That one scene made the movie worth watching and worth purchasing on DVD!I love that movie, though it will not be better than Jurassic Park; no sequel can beat that film. However, this sequel managed to almost be as good, compared to the other sequels which is an improvement. The writers were better, the technology was great, the acting was good, and that climax was AWESOME!!!",Jurassic World
438,alecwest,Spielberg is back!,10,12 June 2015,"""Jurassic Park"" was a great film but the two sequels following it were not quite up to par. But the 4th sequel (this film) redeemed the franchise. Spielberg is back and firing on all thrusters.It's odd. I expected a different kind of movie. But the movie delivered was one I liked nonetheless.(spoiler warnings) The part that worried me the most was the idea that the park trainer could become the ""alpha"" member of the raptor pack. But in a way, it made sense. Remember that raptors are the forerunners of birds. And domesticated birds (like parrots, for example) begin to identify with their owners as if the owners (and sometimes an owner's family) were considered part of the flock. I remember hearing once of a parrot that flew throughout a house, squawking loudly to warn family members that their house was on fire. This is not atypical behavior for domesticated birds. However, I was heartened later on when the raptor pack showed that their loyalty to the ""alpha"" member was fickle when a new potential ""alpha"" entered the fray - at least until the new ""alpha"" demonstrated weakness.My favorite part of the film is when the aunt wondered out loud how they'd get the better of the hybrid dinosaur - and one of the kids replied, ""We need more teeth."" And that was pretty-much the first time in the film we got to see a T-Rex in action ... even though a different dinosaur ultimately got the better of the hybrid (a neat surprise).""Jurassic Park 5"" (or ""Jurassic World 2"")? There were two hints at a potential sequel. First, the flying reptiles were free. They'd likely fly to the Costa Rican mainland where they could easily travel North, South, and East throughout the Americas. Secondly, the ""military"" toadies on Isla Nublar (minus their leader) did make it to safety with the genetic samples and the Asian scientist who reprised his role from ""Jurassic Park.""",Jurassic World
439,Nobody-27,Better than your average special effects fest,7,17 June 2015,"First of all Jurassic World is a piece of entertainment rather than art, so I base my vote and review on that.If you were curious as to the overall story and feel of the movie, I will only say that if you liked the first Jurassic Park, you will most likely like this one too. The writers and director have taken the sequel formula quite literally, down to repeats of entire scenes and shots. The thing that is new is a new character, the menacing dino, and the performance of the dinosaurs - they definitely feel more natural and one can even feel their characters. Kudos to the FX crew for that. I also enjoyed the somewhat stylized approach to violence in film - there is enough action to keep one on the edge of their seat without gore. So kudos for that too.The story itself is essentially a repeat of the first film, with few twists and turns: things go wrong, then they go terribly wrong, lives are in danger, and our hero tries to save the day.What I disliked in the film were overly dumb dialogues and exposition. They go way beyond clichés and border on mentally retarded, with IQ of those scenes hovering around 50-60. A teen kid hates his younger but smarter brother - just like that. It supposedly makes for a more interesting story. A nice woman hates her first date but he is still trying; the forced and outright dumb banter between them makes me want to vomit and force the writers to watch some much more entertaining classics such as ""To Catch a Thief"". Kids are again directed to act like grown-ups which only makes it hard for the viewer to maintain the suspension of disbelief. And then, there are things such as our heroine running through mud in high heels and emerging out of it all with those shoes firmly on, and clean.Luckily, those cringe-worthy moments did not last long enough to make me lose interest, and the action and the rest of it was entertaining enough that I am willing to forgive the tendency to cater to the lowest common denominator. Actually, I am not even sure that Hollywood understands how to cater to the lowest common denominator... this film would have been just as successful if not much more so, with smarter dialogues and a story that does not leave a loose end here and there. If it had the same story but smarter characters/dialogues I, and many I know, would give it a higher rating.With all that being said, this is still a fine piece of entertainment. I especially like the fact that director opted for tension induced by our expectations and fears rather than outright gore. It also makes the film (relatively) safe for kids.So, if you go in to be entertained, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.ps. Watched it in 3D, and it was OK, but I still fail to see what the attraction is all about over 2D...",Jurassic World
440,sickofenjoyingmyself,"Light hearted, visual spectacle",7,11 August 2016,"Jurassic World is light hearted in tone and nature throughout. This consistency makes it enjoyable for the wider audience, and I enjoyed it myself as a spectacle. There isn't any real depth to the film - the story line is comfortingly predictable and it has the cheesy one liners to accompany it. The cheesy one liners are a bit tongue in cheek - they are are geared to have fun with the audience and it works. The cast works. Chris Pratt plays the hero effortlessly. The one person who stood out for me and gave depth to a role was Vincent D'Onofrio. He was intense and quietly sinister. The visual and special effects make the movie a real spectacle. Some of the sequences are great to watch and give it a real blockbuster quality. It doesn't offer anything deeper than that and doesn't try to. It lacks the tension and genuine quality of the original but it's still enjoyable viewing.",Jurassic World

This is a new chapter to Jurassic Park that can perfectly stand on its own. The film has many scenes that remind us of the original film with bigger action sequences and visual epicness. While the film may not be as SCARY and intensely thrilling as the original but it's guaranteed to entertain the hell out of you for its whole running time. What I really wish here is if this film was to be rated R, it will definitely be a bloodbath horror show that will surely satisfy horror fans but no doubt that this is a family film, so just saying. However, that doesn't mean the movie is tame at all, considering it as a hard PG-13 rating with a surprise amount of GORY scenes and deaths to bring more horror and thrill to the story and the 3D helps add those up as well.

Having screenwriters from Rise of the Planet of the Apes' franchise, the engineering field of genetic modification works efficiently on the historic extincted animals and at the same time allows the plot to stress on the greediness of human nature, the ethical and morality behind as well as the dire consequences. Scores from Michael Giacchino mostly remain the original theme composed by John Williams, creating a sense of revisiting the old park while performance of Chris Pratt sparks with his serious characteristic throughout the entire film. The story is further well balanced with intense action sequences, fury battle between the dinosaurs and splendid visual effects although there's a few scenes of obvious CGI flaws.

Teams of men that set out to capture a 50ft dinosaur with non-lethal weapons... really?... you'd have to be a utter moron to do that.Eventually when a an armed team is brought together to hunt a creature that can camouflage itself really well during the day, they do it at night... bullshit.Veloceraptors that change allegiance repeatedly and suddenly team up with T-Rex which doesn't eat them for some unknown reason... preposterous.The CGI is great and it's improvements over previous movies are obvious, but can't substitute for a poor story, told in a very predictable, unoriginal and unimaginative way.",Jurassic World
444,dutchs-1,A decent monster movie,8,24 June 2015,"We know they can clone dinosaurs, so we don't have the element of wonder from the first film. What we do have are some of the stupidest ""scientific"" criticisms ever made. ""The dinosaurs are still shown with leathery skin instead of feathered."" Well, we know some small dinosaurs were feathered, but we have no evidence on the larger ones. Whales, elephants and hippos are all mammals and theoretically have hair, but not to a casual observer. ""The dinosaurs are drab colors."" But so are most birds, to the point where an ornithologist friend of mine referred to many as ""LBJ's"" - ""Little Brown Jobs."" They're either trying to prey on something or avoid being prey, and camouflage helps.Jurassic World's numbers are going flat, so the suits decide on a new and scarier dino, a hybrid of T-Rex, raptor and other things. And it's clever enough to dig out its tracking device and escape. And while it effectively destroys the security teams sent in to get it, most of the carnage in the park itself is done by flying reptiles that escape from their dome. The jury is still out on whether they had powered flight at all, and they certainly could not have carried a human, let alone the baby dino we see being lifted at one point.And of course they have corporate bad guys. This is something of a Law and Order reunion, with Vincent D'Onofrio (the mild mannered stammering detective) as a creep with a scheme to weaponize raptors, and B.D. Wong (the prosecutor) as an amoral geneticist. D'Onofrio's demise is entirely predictable but still satisfying. Gee, a corporation shown as evil in a movie - once again.

Jurassic Park fans finally got their wish in a very big way. Yes, there's been some odd-bag remarks, but ultimately you have to decide whether it's a worthy sequel or not. Set 22 years since the incident in the original film, Jurassic World takes a slightly different turn from the other two sequels. There's enough grounded material to remind the viewer that this is a Jurassic Park film, yet takes a few new turns. Steven Spielberg may not be directing this one, but he's got his signature all over it, everything from the visual concepts to the tid-bits. Yes, it's not Jurassic Park, but it's what Jurassic Park should have been if the attraction ever got off the ground. It's a well packed action movie that hardly lets down once it starts. There are plenty of Easter Eggs to be found with references to the first three films, relying heavily on the original Jurassic Park.

Predictability aside the terror is probably what most viewers will be vying for. Myself included. But even that was disappointing. So many bodies with so few fatalities it's rather underwhelming. Yes that sounds sadistic but the film had no qualms with letting the dinosaur rip into another dinosaur. Why not the CGI humans too?The biggest problem with ""Jurassic World"" is the ludicrous notion that a dinosaur can be trained. Lets look at the closest relative of the dinosaur – the crocodile. There isn't a crocodile park in the world that performs tricks with such creatures. Come to think of it, have you ever even seen a shark trained like a dolphin or whale? No, because it can't be done. So the connection of these dinosaurs to real animals of today was both poorly researched and implemented.In the end the film rehashes tired clichés amplified with cheesy music and shot choices. This move was very disappointing. The special effects were impressive at times and a let down at others. The resort and the pterodactyl didn't look authentic enough.

The only problem I had with this was that the story felt like a modern copy of the original Jurassic Park, there are plot holes, and the first half was clichéd, but it was still fun and worth watching. But the characters weren't really amusing or worth remembering except for Owen, who is easily the best one. The other sequels, the lost world and Jurassic park 3 have barely any connection with this and they were pointless. Like if you watch the first Jurassic park and then watch this, you wouldn't miss any plot points. The special effects are great like other modern day. films by the way as well.

And like any theme park, the managers focussing on analysis score and rating etc and typically pushing for anything to raise its performance.The science of the park led them into genetic engineering, an area they had touched on in the original film as they had completed genetic codes with that on amphibians. But here they ran with it more, using modern techniques to create a dinosaur, the indominus rex.As in the original Jurassic Park, and a theme that was continued in part by both sequels, the film focused on two children who were related to the main operator of the park (Mr Masrani was basically an investor, not the one who ran the park)I liked the ideas behind the training of the raptors, building on the underlying premise of Jurassic Park 3 that raptors were smart creatures and, as is human nature, the military were looking to use that to thier advantage.I though how they set the raptors loose to hunt the indominus rex was a bit predictable, as was the fact that it was part raptor itself and they joined with it to fight/hunt the humans. How did they not see that coming?I thought how the raptors turned against the indominus rex seemed a bit out of place, yes they probably were closer to Owen as he had raised them, but for lethal pack hunters it seemed a bit implausible.
Predictably, and naturally, the indominus rex was winning the fight (it was bigger and stronger with more teeth) and eventually only one raptor remained.When Clare went to get the tyrannosaur to fight the indominus rex it seemed very odd, a big predator and the main 'villain' of two previous films suddenly easily controlled? Unlikely
I realise it had received some training itself with the flare leading to food, but why didn't it try to eat Clare as she was holding the flare?With the tyrannosaur in the fight the film turned very poor, I can see what they were trying for - nature vs genetic creation - but what they got was a rather pathetic 'tag team' whereby two dangerous predators worked together to fight the indominus rex, leading it to the pool where the mosasaurus finished it off.
Then to add insult to injury the tyrannosaur and raptor shared a 'knowing look' before going their separate ways, it was very cheesy and I was half-expecting them to high-five.The ending seriously let this film down, a film that started so promisingly.",Jurassic World

For example some of the dialogue is very cheesy. The action is very done well. The acting is good and once again Chris Pratt shows he can lead a movie and do it in a funny and great way. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are two brothers but the story focuses too much on them at times, that you just don't care about and want more of the Owen(Chris Pratt) and Claire's storyline more.

The CGI is good but at sometimes, you could see that they could of easily should animatronics and it could of looked a lot more real.

Number 2 and Number three never happened based on where this film is drawn from If you see this in the theater bring ear plugs.You are supposed to feel something for these characters, but you don't you hope they all are eaten, seriously you want that to happen.This movie is very predictable.Small homages are paid to the first movie Jurassic Park, watching for them can be fun Again, you are supposed to believe one of the kids in the movie is a genius. He keeps asking questions and you really want him to shut up. You first meet this fake boy genius looking behind a Viewmaster Viewer. We are in 2015 no kid especially a supposed genius is going to be using one. Tablet yes, Viewmaster Viewer no. Yes I realize it is a ""Product Placement"" (A product placement is when a company like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Sony pay for their product to be in the movie).It is set rather early on that Isla Nublar gets bad cell phone reception but two times in this move absolutely no problem. The first time is when the boys run off on their Aunt's assistant and she is talking to her fiancé'. The second time is when the boys' mother calls their Aunt. All other times cellphones and radio communications is bad at best.Hmmmm......A Dino whisperer, former Navy Officer hired fresh from him finishing with his tour in the Navy. Now I am no expert on what the Navy trains on. However I am 1001% sure they do not train anyone in animal behavior and that Velociraptors are going to listen to him.The two boys get lost in on the island and managed to find an old garage. In it are some old jeeps from the first Jurassic Park (Now renamed Jurassic World). The boys get one of the jeeps to run. HOW please tell me HOW a jeep is just going to turn over after twiddling with an engine 2 seconds that has been siting abandoned 20 plus years. Not only that this is a tropical island, Rubber hoses and tires are going to rot. The gas also will be bad. So another miracle.I only give this only gets two stars because it was fin to see hints from the original Jurassic Park movie.",Jurassic World

Just a lot of well crafted special effect Dinosaurs, getting their own back on the human beings, and frankly, I couldn't blame them.",Jurassic World
454,jmhammerstein-980-842586,very bad,1,22 October 2016,Jurassic World is a crap fest. It's about this park where you can go and see living dinosaurs and Pterosaurs and a Mosasaur. The Mosasaur is in a show like a killer whale in Sea World. This movie doesn't have anything that is particularly good in it except the special effects. Maybe they ran out of good ideas for Jurassic Park movies after The Lost World. The Indominus Rex is a very bad idea. They should stick with real dinosaurs. I really thought I might see something good. I was disappointed. This is an awful movie. The first one is really good. The second one is much better. Anyone who says the first one is better than the second is wrong. The second is obviously quite a bit better. Anyone who says Jurassic World is better than the first or second is off their freaking rocker!!! Jurassic World is worse than Jurassic Park 3. The Lost World is definitely the best. Jurassic Park is the second best. Jurassic World and Jurassic Park 3 are far far behind the first two.,Jurassic World
455,ConsistentlyFalconer,Cheesosaurus,7,28 June 2015,"I can't believe I sat in the cinema and watched the first film in the series TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO. Hell's teethAnyway, taking the wise decision to ignore the second and third films of the series, this was a fun, well-made action romp with plenty of clever - but not smug - nods to the original (including themes from John Williams' score). Scary bits, funny bits, somewhat gruesome bits and the CGI held up to scrutiny in a way it so disappointingly doesn't these days! My only problems with the film were the occasional OTT Hollywood moments (esp. towards the end, but then again you can't really complain about a Hollywood blockbuster having Hollywood blockbuster moments in it!), and the fact that the female characters were either Cold, Childless Monsters, or spent most of their screen time crying. Because everybody knows, your life cannot possibly be complete if you don't have children. I know this because Hollywood told me so. Also, Ty Simpkins is a cracking little actor - it'll be interesting to see if he carries this on into adulthood. Hope he does!yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",Jurassic World

457,AliceofX,Satisfying,7,20 June 2015,"It's strange. As I was sitting in the bus on my way home the plot deficiencies started coming to me. I could not put my finger on it, but something seemed to escape me. Storywise there was nothing in Jurassic World to elevate above the usual action flicks, no unique plot to really make it stand out. Looking back I started to feel empty. And yet as I was sitting in the cinema none of that really bothered me. These feelings came only later but as I was watching the film I felt completely satisfied. As far as action movies go I would easily put it amidst the best of the year.But returning to the plot, first with the major negatives:1.) Simple Plot. The story is fairly straightforward - they make a giant killer dinosaur, she escapes and wreaks havoc. Storywise nothing else happens. It could work, but only with more memorable characters that leap out of the screen. And while Jurassic World has good performances it does not have the kind of characters to make up for the simple story. And that is the biggest fault of the film. 2.) Clair and Owen's romance. When he kissed her it just came completely out of nowhere. Sure, it is established a bit that they once kind of, sort of had a thing, but that is never built up and their romance is entirely superfluous to the story.3.) Dinosaur intelligence. Just how intelligent are they supposed to be? First Indominus Rex makes the velociraptors switch allegiance, even though she is supposed to have no social skills. Then the velociraptors waver in their allegiance, turn against Indominus Rex and have an ""understanding"" with T. Rex. It's just all too anthropomorphic for a supposedly serious film.With the bad out of the way here is what I really liked about the film:1.) How they explained the name Indominus Rex. It's just so perfect and self aware.2.) Masrani seeing Indominus Rex for the first time. It was the perfect first reveal of a monster.3.) Owen's character. He is probably the saving grace of this movie.4.) Final fight between Indominus Rex and T. Rex.So in the end Jurassic World - definitely one of the summer must- see's, a good action film but storywise don't expect too much.",Jurassic World

459,j-penkair,Dull And Unimaginative Story On Purpose?,7,13 June 2015,"My companion and I enjoyed ""Jurassic World"" immensely, especially with the exciting 4DX. When the mixed-bred gigantic dinosaur plays tricks and then escapes, the excitement never lets down, right to the end. I can't find (and didn't actually look for) a false note on entertainment. Exciting, engaging, grabbing, and visually breathtaking. Indeed another strong contender for Best Special Visual Effects on Oscar stage. However, the entertainment values of this film seem an alternate to, or as opposed to, those of education or edutainment. The story is made so lame, so dull, and so predictable in every inch of the way, as if filmmakers feared that the educational values would take away those of entertainment. I find this phenomenon very odd. It is given that a filmmaking of this scale should have no problem finding a good story or a good storyteller. There should be no reason for the un-imagination, except it is done on purpose, with quite a wrong notion that viewers can't take both entertainment and education altogether. Some experts on BBC already complain that this film has become a huge ""missed opportunity"". There is a period of 20 years from ""Jurassic Park"" (Part 1) to ""Jurassic World"" (Part 4). Enormous discoveries have been made in the field, and yet any of those new bodies of knowledge hardly find themselves into this film's ""new"" story. ""Jurassic World"" comes close of becoming a classic, only if human characters and social notions were explored and delicately exhibited. This is neither my call nor my wish to turn a money-making machine into a boring school. I simply say to Mr. and Ms. Hollywoods out there: it is not at all difficult, dear, to achieve both ends in one undertaking.",Jurassic World

461,joeravioli,"Putrid, soulless, and devastating, Jurassic World is the worst that cinema has to offer",1,29 June 2015,"There is one scene that I believe sums up this hellish, putrid excuse for a film. A woman, with little or no plot significance, is mauled by a pterodactyl. Then, as if that wasn't enough, she is picked up, screaming, by the pterodactyl who lifts her extremely high before dropping her. As she plummets, another pterodactyl catches her and carries her over a small body of water before dropping her. They proceed to drown her, pushing her screaming body back in every time she resurfaces. Then, completing the horrifying mayhem of this three-or- so minute long scene, a massive, sea dwelling creature bursts out of the water, catching the woman and her assailant in its massive jaws. It then wrenches them shut, and falls back into the water.And we, as an audience, should be vomiting at this point.What did the woman do to deserve this? Did she have a moral failing or some sort? Was she evil? No. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And by that, I mean she was in this limp, horrifying ""film"" so called Jurassic World. Oops. I meant Jurassic Worst.Jurassic Worst is a nasty, cruel, poor, ninety-fifth rate, shoddy, miserable, careless, amateurish, slow, lousy, crummy, rotten, destructive, delirious, atrocious, unacceptable, execrable, black- hearted, worthless, crooked, dirty, godawful, and entirely unpleasant two hours of canned drama and worthless, repetitive dinosaur rampages. The entire movie, fraught with average performances and dull humour, left me feeling heartbroken at the horrifying waste of time I had unwillingly experienced.Here is the plot summary in a nutshell: Jurassic Worst, a theme park, needs a new attraction. They build a dinosaur that is pretty dangerous. That dinosaur breaks out and wreaks havoc, until it is beaten up by a T. Rex, and subsequently eaten by another dinosaur. Oops. Spoiler.There is nothing visually striking about this film. Much of the visuals are even slightly disappointing. You would expect the park to be a fancy, futuristic place. However, it is rather small, and completely lackluster, despite the occasional holographic dinosaur. In fact, we barely see the park, exposed instead to its even more boring inner workings, which are basically dinosaur pens, a control room, and Chris Pratt's shack.Now we get to the characters. There are two main children in this film, brothers who come to the park to visit their aunt. The younger brother is an annoying know-it-all, constantly spouting facts or running around impatiently, giving him a painful association with a mosquito constantly on the move for a new host. The older brother is a good actor, but his performance is hampered by his character's inconsistency, and his tendency to stare at pretty girls while not saying anything even though he has a girlfriend at home. Their aunt, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is a nitpicky, red-haired administrator of some sort, who, while striving to the best of her abilities, is extremely boring to watch, her lines being canned and slow. Chris Pratt's inherent charisma sadly comes off as cockiness as he struts around, doing little other than admiring his raptors, fixing cars, and being the great American hero that the script gives him no right to be. All the characters are extremely one- dimensional, showing little change throughout the movie. So even before the action begins, it takes a considerable effort to get into this movie.And then, as it had begun to seem like it never would, the action begins. I hoped that I would be able to sit back and relax, but I constantly found myself either disgusted or sighing at the lifeless attempt at character drama. The film would constantly use the same shot to create intensity. Someone would be hiding behind something, then a massive pair of teeth would come up close to them, and then, the teeth would leave, either for good, or to return two seconds later through a wall. The second time onward, it completely lost its effect. The film was not intense (except for one shot that was pretty solid, but this counts as a small gold nugget in a mountain of trash), and suffered from a severe lack of sense and morality. Crowds of innocent people simply enjoying their day are murdered or beaten up by careless animals, diving in on people in a vile feeding frenzy. And no one seemed to care.It is hard to root for anyone in this film, even Chris Pratt. The kids are either annoying or flaky. Howard runs around in heels for the entire movie. Chris Pratt is cocky. The stereotypical nerd character is self-entitled and careless. The boss of the park is an absolute idiot (he was great in The Lunchbox, though). The bad guys are, well, bad. And the raptors that are supposed to help Chris Pratt are super unstable, sometimes killing people, and sometimes doing what is right. Literally, the only thing in the whole movie that is possible to root for is the T. Rex, who gets barely any screen time.The deaths are ridiculous and indiscriminate, each one more horrifying and immoral than the one that came before. I know that it is more ""realistic"" to have everyone die, rather than just the bad people, but Jurassic Worst was not made to be realistic. It's a stupid dinosaur movie, for goodness' sake!Walking out of the theatre, I felt sick and sad. I had wasted two hours watching a limp, soulless massacre, made complete by the torture and murder of an innocent woman. If this is what cinema is going to become, if this is what we flock in droves to see, if this is all I can expect from Hollywood, then I refuse to take part in it.I'm not going to understate it. Jurassic Worst is heartbreakingly awful.",Jurassic World
462,allstarrunner,Eh,6,6 July 2018,"I heard they were doing a reboot with Chris Pratt and I was all in - but unfortunately for me, in my mind, I had imagined that they were going to go back to a darker and grittier, more tense feel of the original Jurassic Park - clearly that was my own mistake. This was basically Jurassic Park inside the Marvel world; it felt like a marvel movie not a tense thriller like Spielberg delivered. So, I suppose, if you really like all the Marvel movies (which I do too) then you know what you're getting; however, if like me, you were hoping for a more tense thriller without comedy quips to break any tension that is ever brought up then will will also be disappointed with this film. Not to mention, the plot is very predicable. It is an entertaining enough movie, but it doesn't do anything to truly make it great.",Jurassic World
463,Alise_shenle,I'm an armchair dinosaur expert and I loved it,10,15 June 2015,"Firstly, I would like to establish my credentials. I've been to all the ancient paleozoological museums and dinosaur exhibitions in my country, and I know about the difference between dinosaurs, names ending in -suchus are reptiles and mammal-like reptiles like ischigualastia and chaliminia. I also know that most of the dinosaurs including T-Rex is in the cretaceous period and not Jurassic. And most recently, the dinosaur that appeared in the first scene in Transformers 4 is a scaphonyx, and thus, herbivorous, not eating meat as shown. 1. So we need to get aside the problem of dinosaurs not looking ""realistic"". Well, as long as there is some rational explanation, such as ""filling up the gaps of DNA"", then it's OK. So not a big problem. 2. The irritating children. As a 21 year old, I find myself getting touched by the interaction between the boys. The younger one is familiar from Insidious and Iron Man 3--he's cute. I think their sibling dynamic is realistic. I've got a really young sister and I also act like Zack, jerk and rebel. 3. There is hot chemistry between the leads. I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out who Claire was--I kept on thinking Emma Stone then I realized it's the other Gwen Stacy. Chris Pratt looked like Patrick Wilson and Jensen Ackles. They would have made a hot couple. Only problem is how did Claire survive in high heels? And why did her hair suddenly turn curly. 4. The movie is very funny. From helicopter hijinks to flirting dialogue. 5. A lot of foreshadowing. We're shown the mosasaur 3 times, I'm sure there's a reason and not just for the cool factor. It's not a deux ex machina if you're aware of it. Overall, this is an unexpected summer box office hit--don't miss it. You will not be disappointed, as long as you have a sibling, loved Guardians of the Galaxy, or dinosaurs.",Jurassic World
464,matt_hew,The Park rehashed to the World,4,14 February 2016,"So the park has opened (again) with the main star being another (bigger/nastier) T-Rex (again) with a clutch of Velociraptors in a supporting role (again). There's a couple of annoying kids (again) being chased (again) while others are trying to unsuccessfully stop the 'T-Rex' (again) whilst a splinter group are using the situation for their own financial gain (again)!This movie is just a predictable polish of the original on a grander scale. The story is weak, the casting and acting the same - polished with some extra CGI.The overused Velociraptors (again) seem to be suffering from a crisis of conscience. One minute they're supposed to be subordinate to Starlord but, 2min later they are trying to kill/eat him, to then happily going on a road trip with him 30min later, to then trying to eat him again (after a quick chat with the 'V-Rex') only to then decide they're on the side of humanity after all.

There are no philosophical questions here about nature and playing with DNA. No lesson about how not to force evolution. This is a summer blockbuster and that's about it.It contains action, comedy, mystery, a few good laughs and a few ""I wonder what is going to happen next"" moments.I haven't seen the other Jurassic Park movies (except the original and the 3D release) but if you want an enjoyable movie which is not too deep nor that revolutionary, but well executed, watch it. I just wish that in the next sequel they'll move away from the formula. It would be interesting to see how dinosaurs escape on the mainland, not on the island. For better or for worse, there isn't a lot of tension knowing that they can simply bombard the entire island and get it over with.However, again, this is no Citizen Kane.

469,Maz-hell,The best Jurassic Park sequel... which is not saying much.,7,10 February 2018,"I was a little kid when the legendary work of Steven Spielberg came into life. The dream of every child not brainwashed came into cinema: Dinosaurs coming into life from drops of blood obtained from mosquitoes. The empathy you actually feal to the characters. It is a true piece of art. Then 2 (sad goldbloom) and 3 (Alan!) came and pretty much transformed the legendary piece into garbage. Now lets check the fourth installment of the franchise (yeah, fourth. The film acknoledges this).The good part: The cinematography is angelical. Not demeaning the photography. Both aspects are fenomenal. Even when the CGI was added the fotography is angelical, even when CGI was supremely obvious. Specially in shots that should have been done with practical effects, like the dying brontosaurus one, even if it was a little forced, specially because you were at all not worried about YOUR NEPHEWS ARE ACTUALLY BEING HUNTED BY A DINOSAUR.The music is extraordinary... because most of it was actually just recompositions from the preceding films.The bad and ugly: The characters and the plot. Both of them are important if not the most important part of any film. Let's start with the characters: You feel no empathy for them. You actually couldn't give any less of a damn for them. The brothers tried to get your empathy... about the 2 hour mark. Not a good moment in a 2 hours and a quarter movie. The aunt was seriously forced on you to like her and to consider her relatable to the Chris Pratt character but... no. Impossible. There was absolutely no chemestry between them. You could have erased her, her sister and the dad out of the movie and nothing would have changed. The ""villain"" was even worse: You hate him but not because the character, but because you are actually forced to hate him, like in a cartoon: ""This are the good guys, this is the bad guy. Hate him for not discernible reason"" The bosses are idiots, the friend of Chris Pratt was actually there for 5 minutes... Actually, the only character you end empatizacing with is Chris Pratt. It is the only one you root for.The plot is painful: It's the first movie. Seriously, it is the first movie, but with a dinosaur vs dinosaurs battle at the end. Nothing else matters.To say it shortly: an enjoyable film for the images, but not for the plot. I recommend to stay with Jurassic Park.",Jurassic World

471,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Jurassic World Review,6,11 June 2015,"My Thoughts: So let us delve into the latest sequel to Jurassic Park, as the summary states this takes place twenty-two years after the first movie, and some how, they got the park up and running without any incidents so far. I would love to go to a place where dinosaurs roam, but I can just imagine the cost of a family vacation to Isla Nublar; you have to fly down to Costa Rica and then take a ferry over to the island. So not only is there no other place to stay if you want to be close to the park then whatever hotels the Park has allowed on the island, but now they have you over the barrel because there is no other choice in hotels, food, or any other amenities.But that is all just a side thought, really. So, we get introduced to Jurassic World by--yep, you guessed it--two new kids, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson), who happen to be related to the Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who seems to run the day-to-day operations of the park and nothing else. At the beginning of the movie, Claire is such a one-dimensional character that you ask yourself why she would ever be put in charge of such a grand park. She has no passion for what they are doing there; all she cares about are the numbers and making sure the park is making its money. Even the owner of the park, Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who was willed the park by Richard Hammond after his death, tells her she is too uptight. Due to Claire being so focused on her job, she entrusts the care of her nephews to her assistant who, of course, the kids ditch within a matter of minutes. Oh, and the assistant, instead of telling Claire that she lost her nephews on Dino island, disappears until the sh!t hits the fan and Claire contacts her looking for her nephews.So how does Jurassic World get to the point that we are at now with this new big, bad dinosaur about to wreck havoc on the park? Just like any park, people get bored with it after awhile unless you add a new attraction, and Jurassic World is no different. There are only so many times you can pay such a high price to go see the same dinosaurs over and over again. This hasn't been too much of a problem due to them being able to find new dinosaur DNA around the world, but that just doesn't satisfy everyone; they want a dinosaur that is big and bad and scary, and the only way they can figure out to do that is to splice together all kinds of different dinosaur and other DNA together to create Indominus Rex.So, needless to say, all of the precautions the park has taken to keep Indominus Rex safely isolated from the rest of the park do not measure up, and she escapes her confinement, and that is when all h3ll breaks loose. She isn't really trying to find a way to escape; she is trying to figure out where she fits in the hierarchy of the island, and for most of the movie, there isn't anything or anyone that is able to stop her.One of the things that had me thinking during this crisis was ""where were their procedures for handling the public during break outs like these?"" First, they knew what befell the first park as they are on the island where it all began; plus, they discuss it in the movie. So, when they call all of the park visitors back to the central area, all of the visitors are sitting in the open, unprotected. I get it that the park believes that they can handle anything that happens and that no dinosaurs will ever make it to the central area, but if I was the one designing a new park over the ashes of the original, I would have put in place an evacuation protocols as well as shelter areas that could withstand a head on dinosaur attack, but it seems the writers didn't really care that much. I get it--it adds to the action and tension when you see the public panic when, of course, the dinosaurs make it to the central area.Were there plot holes and annoyances with this movie? Yes. I, for one, think we could have done without the kids in the movie. If you cut them out, it would not have hurt the movie one bit; they did not really add any value to the movie except to show you around, which was pretty much done whilst following Indominus Rex as well as from the viewpoint of those chasing her. Bryce Dallas Howard's character seemed to find her inner family heart halfway through this when she, all of a sudden, remembers that she has two nephews on the island, and I just didn't buy any of it. I do have to say, I did enjoy Chris Pratt's character; he is one that I haven't gone into too many details about because I want people to see it and have their own opinion of him and the Raptors.However, with all that being said, Jurassic World is a summer blockbuster popcorn flick; you are not going to this movie because you want to see a great script, you are going to see majestic landscapes and dinosaurs walking the Earth again. And, of course, dinosaur fights, which this movie delivers to you in spades, especially the end battle event. Even though the end was quite predictable, I still enjoyed watching it on screen. My Recommendation: This is a fun movie to be enjoyed on a hot summer day when you want to sit in the A/C theater and watch dinosaurs on the big screen.",Jurassic World
472,CrisMovieCorner,"""It's like the perfect sequel... 22 years later""",7,13 June 2015,"So here we are 22 years after Steven Spielberg changed for that generation and every subsequent generation since, the original Jurassic Park is an all time favourite of mine and millions of others I'd imagine. So how did the latest instalment in the franchise by Colin Trevorrow hold up against the rest? Lets start off with the story, a well paced blockbuster, with some nice turns that while aren't mind-blowing, they will surely keep you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to say too much and give it away, but they also wrote in some wonderful nods to the original which the fans of the first will adore and the younger fans will love when they are told about them. There is times when the subplots do not seem to make that much sense, that could be due to longevity that the project has gone through with numerous rewrites and tweaks, notably the parents getting divorced it didn't add anything to the film and didn't change the view of the young lads. That aside the story was solid and simple but a nice ride.Another stellar cast for a Jurassic Park film, who would have thought that they could build a cast that was as enjoyable to watch as the original? I surely didn't, there was some brilliant performances some that really stood out for me were Ty Simpkins who at 13 is kick ass in the acting world, Nick Robinson, Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt who is fun in ANYTHING he does, the dude is just a joy to watch plus his and Bryce's on screen chemistry felt real. D'Onofrio serves as the human villain in the film and to be honest he really isn't as good as we are used to seeing him, it feels over the top if you will. Saying these performances stood up does not mean I found the others lacking, just not as great as these specific ones. Not the right place to say but yet again another performance from Nick Robinson that adds credence to my personal opinion that he would make a pretty good Peter Parker, thought it since I first seen him in ""Melissa & Joey"".Yet again another film in the series that had some breathtaking cinematography, which was done by the very talented Academy Award nominee John Schwartzman, some of the wide shots are beautiful. Which for the Jurassic World franchise is a big thing, I mean look at the first, it has one of the greatest all time pieces of cinematography, so this one had to have some wonderful shots too, which do not worry it does.Hard to believe this is only Colin Trevorrow's second feature film, which he did not only direct he also co-writ with his previous writing partner Derek Connolly who he worked with on ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". Which was an enjoyable film according to the people I have spoken to about it, Colin does what many directors over the past decade have worried they couldn't do, he made a film 22 years after the original and still was able to keep that wonderful charm the first had. This film is by no means better than the first, but was easily the second best in the franchise, after this I can see Colin going VERY far in the movie world.My only complaint really was the lack of practical effects, I have always been an advocate for practical effects. The use of them in the original especially when the dinosaur hatches from the egg was something that made me fall in love with the art form that is practical effects. I just feel more drawn in when it comes it practical effects, not to say the CGI was poor or anything, the film was still visually stunning, it is just a personal preference of mine to have visual effects if and when possible. If so we would still have masters like Rick Baker working in the business and not retiring. That all being said, the visuals effects were amazing to watch and I'm sure anybody would agree, they also had a wonderful use of scale on the dinosaurs to really give the audience the feeling of how big these ""monsters"" truly would be if around today.Overall this film was a thoroughly good watch, heck good it was great. I enjoyed it start to finish, it was not what I expected but it was brilliant none the less. Throughout the film there is a few misses, however the rest of the film really delivers in a big way I found. While it doesn't hit the heights of the first film it was truly a masterpiece in the blockbuster, bringing back the summer family blockbuster I really hope. Fingers crossed this gets Steven Spielberg to jump back into this world and he picks up Chris Pratt for the next Indiana Jones film. This film excelled in all categories and is a brilliant film for all to see, truly a revival of the franchise.",Jurassic World
473,pkneer,Good But Some Glaring Problems,6,8 August 2015,"This movie was good, special effects were excellent, and dinosaurs attack and kill people - everything you'd expect from a Jurassic Park film.The acting was above average - Chris Pratt did a nice job. The kids were annoying as heck.The main problems I had with the film were fairly minor. First, Pratt's character is training Raptors but definitely does not have complete control as they almost eat him when he is with them. Then the next time they are reunited, he leads them in a pack on a motorcycle? That was a huge leap - perhaps if Pratt had had a better handle on the creatures at the start... Then, if you have this really bad dinosaur that everyone is super scared of, why put a giant door in its cage that can be knocked down? The worst was when Howard goes to the T-Rex cage and waits until it is right on her and she outruns it - in heels? Please, I could hear others in the audience groan.Good action and excellent CGI. One of those movies where you should know what you're getting and it gives it to you.",Jurassic World
474,Zulfmanauthor,A Monster-sized adventure !,10,17 June 2015,"The emergence of another 'Jurassic Park' sequel after the failure of 'Jurassic Park III' was bound to open the movie to criticism as exploring the world of dinosaurs seems to have been exhausted. However 'Jurassic World' doesn't try to be anything new, in fact it goes back to the original movie and adds on a few tasty elements. The film is set twenty two years after the original park was closed down after the disastrous events, and an Indian tycoon has now invested in a bigger and better park. However events take a disastrous turn once again due to genetically created experiments that are taking place behind the scenes. The story is good but not too inventive and the action sequences are breath-taking, whereas predictably some of the characters are abit two dimensional. The film is huge and highly enjoyable whether you are a fan of 'Jurassic Park' movies or not, this is old fashioned mayhem. In fact it is much better then the highly rated 'Godzilla' movie from 2014, which never got going. Jurassic World does what a great sequel should do, which is to take what the original had and change a few things while adding on a few sub-plots.

When I watched Jurassic Park I was amazed seeing for the first time dinosaurs in the screen. The way some scenes of it were built to show the radiance of the characters with dinosaurs was perfect. I'm saying this, because in Jurassic World has these kind of scenes, but are not in a similar way. I wasn't with my teeth shaking and having goosebumps as I wanted to be.Please don't think I hated the movie, on the contrary I liked the movie, I had fun watching it, some scenes were awesome, in some I felt like I was in Jurassic Park. It is always cool to see dinosaurs in a well-made movie. About the dinosaurs specifically, the CGI and animatronics used to create them were very good, even if in some moments you can notice the use of special effects. One thing which you can definitely expect to have is some nostalgia if you watched the first movie. It's great to notice maybe just small details but which are related to the first film while watching Jurassic WorldThe characters were played very well, the performances gave the audience interesting characters, some that you hope are not eaten by the dinosaurs, some not. Chris Pratt was great and his relationship with the velociraptors, despite the fear of not working, imaging how can a person has a bond with these kind of creatures, but how it was developed during history, made this fear not happen.",Jurassic World
476,atlihafsteinsson,When perfect ceases to feel real,2,13 June 2015,"I had an enormous good time with Jurassic World. I liked the plot and the characters, the pace was very good and suspenseful, and the film culminates in an awesome way that I did not see coming.Why, then, was I not as scared as I was by the other films? I watched the first movie about a week ago in preparation for this one, and I couldn't block out one question; why does Jurassic World feel less real? The animation is too fluent. A large factor can be blamed on that. Real animals don't move every single joint with every step, like robots. We seem to have a reached a point where too fluent animation results in less connection to reality. Because the dinosaurs don't feel real, they're not as scary. Some animatronics by Stan Winston would've helped. There is even a particular, groan-inducing moment where a character bangs on a window from the outside and leaves his bloody hand imprint on it. That is a B-movie sign right there.And that's a shame, 'cause Jurassic World is not a B-movie. But the dinosaurs, the way they move and - most crucially - the way they eat people isn't as chillingly real like it felt in Jurassic Park and the unfairly maligned The Lost World.And you know what the result of that is? You don't fear the dinosaurs like you did in the first movies. The big evil dinosaur in Jurassic World causes a lot of destruction, but it doesn't scare you like the T-Rex did.In wake of 2014's Godzilla, where they brought a colossal monster to life, Jurassic World has no excuse. I wanted to love it, but it only manages to place third in rank of the four Jurassic Park movies.",Jurassic World

478,varnium,Major Flaw for an Almost Perfect Movie,6,16 June 2015,"The special effects are magnificent. The storyline is not unique and predictable. In fact, it just copied the previous Jurassic Park storyline. It resembles more like a remake than a new genre.The actors are terrible! The dialogs are NOT natural and NOT fluent. It seemed like they memorize it word by word without any intonation. They way the actors interact in some scenes is also not realistic. You can this obviously between Gray (the little boy) and Zach (his older brother). It's like their first time performing on a movie. Some dialogs between Claire and Owen also seemed out of place. This is obvious at the scene when they both visited the Indominus Rex cage. And also the cheesy romantic moment when Claire visited Owen by the lake. It's so out of place and the dialogs are just so plain without any emotions in them.There's many other scenes where the dialogs are just NOT natural and NOT fluent. Like the scene when Hoskins tried to take over command from Claire. If compared to Captain America: the Winter Soldier, at the scene when a coup occurred in Shield's organization, Jurassic World's scene is just so out of place and not worth viewing.If the producer had put more attention on the dialogs and acting, then it would have been a perfect movie. But unfortunately, the dialogs and acting ruined everything!",Jurassic World
479,regula1,"Solid summer blockbuster, solid reboot of franchise, but essentially a repeat.",7,11 June 2015,"For those of us born at a certain time in the early 1990s, ""Jurassic Park"" was THE coolest movie of that era for kids who loved dinosaurs. Its groundbreaking visual effects and life-sized animatronics made it a very believable scare fest.Fast forward 22 years, and you've got yourself something that's good, but not quite ""Jurassic Park"" good.Our story begins at essentially the same part of the first movie about half and hour in; everyone who works at the newly built, polished, and open to the public for several years now Jurassic World park believes their system to be foolproof, the eccentric head investor wants what will wow the kids regardless of wisdom, and only one man recognizes the powder keg they are on: Star Lord.That is, Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt. An ex-Navy officer who now trains Velociraptors to respond to commands, is brought in to inspect the holding pen of a newly created genetic hybrid predator. The park staff, including the park operations manager Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, believes that the new Indominus Rex to be the next big thing.However, like Ian Malcolm in the first film predicted, ""Life will find a way."" Soon enough, mayhem ensues in a not-so-surprising manner and evolves into a perfectly reasonable ""Jurassic Park"" movie.The problem is, this movie was not supposed to be just another ""Jurassic Park"" movie. After waiting over a decade for the fourth installment of the franchise, we were hoping for something truly groundbreaking, something to rival that of the first movie.Three words: not gonna happen.Don't get me wrong. This film is filled with great dialogue and well-timed humor to break up the action. Nevertheless, you can't help but be distracted by all of the none-too-subtle references to the first film, as well as the massive amounts of way-too-obvious product placement (I'm looking at you, Mercedes!)Big picture, though. If all you're expecting is a well-paced thriller with cool dinosaurs facing off against a Guardian of the Galaxy, this has it all and more. If you were hoping for the shining herald of the next generation of ""Jurassic Park"", all I can say is keep looking.",Jurassic World
480,foxhound-37781,"As far as sequels are concerned, this one is great.",8,27 August 2016,"First thing I want to say, I've been a Jurassic Park fan since I was 4 years old. So naturally I wanted to know all the details about a fourth Jurassic movie. Fans of the series will go into this knowing what to expect straight away. Dinosaurs break loose. Cause a ten ton of havoc. Main protagonists help save the day. The classic formula is there, and a lot of people will definitely have that sense of ""seen it all before"" while they're watching it, but I found Jurassic World to be a very refreshing, and enjoyable monster flick.So the plot is as follows: Set about twenty-two years after the events of the first film, The original Island (Isla Nublar) now has a fully functioning, well organized theme park that is reeling in millions of people every year, profits are up, visitor morale is up and everything that billionaire John Hammond ever dreamed of has become a reality. The only problem is, the general public don't find the existing dinosaurs that enthralling anymore and want to see something new, so the scientists create a genetically modified hybrid, naming it the Indominous Rex. We quickly learn that this new ""rex"" is significantly more dangerous than any other animal in the park, and has in fact caused numerous accidents already to the staff and handlers. It isn't long before this New addition breaks free of its captivity and starts causing all the chaos under the sun (this may come off as a spoiler but it's a Jurassic Park movie so what the hell else were you expecting?).Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are our two main protagonists who play the odd couple who had a fling together previously, They're forced to band together after Claire's nephews go missing in the park and to help try to bring the situation under control. Both of these actors play their roles surprisingly well but I just can't help but feel they weren't really suitable for the main protagonists, and same with the two kids. Ty Simpkins wasn't as impressive in this as he was in the Insidious films which I was mildly disappointed about, but seeing Vincent Donifiro and BD Wong (the only returning character from the first film) was great and they made really worthy additions to the cast. There's a lot of people expressing their disappointment about there being no Alan Grant, or no Ian Malcolm (believe me I love Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum dearly) but you really can't keep having the same characters thrown into the same situation over and over and over again. The thing I love most about Jurassic World is easily the CGI. The Dino's look as cool as ever, especially the raptors, and the couple of new animals we see do their bit to help to keep the setting fresh. One thing that bugged me throughout the film was I couldn't help but find the whole gyro-sphere ride a bit far-fetched, especially when there's other scenes in the film where tourists are being carted around on just an ordinary bus. There's also quite a few predictable moments that took a little bit of fun out of some of the action sequences, but the film is visually stunning and anyone who goes to movies like this for the special effects will have no problem enjoying it. The music is also noteworthy; the new score is awesome and does justice from start to finish.There's also a few Easter eggs to keep an eye out for that fans of the series will recognize. There's a few elements from the original that make appearances, from the old visitor center, to Tim Murphy's night vision goggles, the Jeep Wranglers and even the quirky, animated DNA character shows himself again. I believe there is even a store in the main visitor hub called ""Winston's"" which the producers threw in as a tribute to the late Stan Winston.Overall, Jurassic World is a visually stunning, highly enjoyable monster flick. It does everything it can to build on what made the first movie so fantastic. The pacing is solid enough to keep you entertained from start to finish, but just don't make the mistake of taking it too seriously. At the end of the day It's just fiction! Just sit back, chill out with some popcorn and enjoy one of the coolest and most visually impressive monster flicks the film industry has on offer.",Jurassic World
481,Parks,Great Fun - Don't Think About The Subtext...,8,26 December 2016,"I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Jurassic Park - which is practically a remake of the original in terms of storyline, but manages to re-energise the series by having likable leads and a genuinely scary monster.The plot is by-the-numbers for a monster film. Tree-hugging animal lovers talk about animals, while evil corporate types talk about assets. As a bonus, we've also got an oily Vince D'Onofrio muttering about using the beasts for military purposes. I think we know who's going to make it and who's going to end up as dino-snax.But I forgive it that, for the spectacle and the verve of the piece. I even forgive it for wasting Irrfan Khan, my favourite Bollywood actor.What's harder to stomach is the not-so-subtle message that women who don't take care of kids aren't proper women. Dudes can get away with this sort of behaviour but Bryce Dallas Howard's character (and her assistant) clearly have something wrong with them for not going all dewey and matronly when kids show up. Even the mother (Judy Greer, who seems to be making a career as put-upon mom in films lately) is shown as letting down the side by working. Hey, where's dad in all this? Funnily enough, no-one mentions how he neglects his kids by daring to have a job.It's a bit mid-1970's in terms of attitude is what I'm saying. But - sigh - I'll overlook that too. You can think too much about these things. Howard is actually pretty good in the movie, Chris Pratt is great and the raptors are just adorable. The kids aren't too annoying. I'm not fond of kids in films. I suspect if I was in a Jurassic Park film I'd get eaten in the first 10 minutes for admitting that.",Jurassic World

I won't spoil anything, but I will try to give you an idea of what to expect. The story follows the visit of Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins), two kids, who visit Isla Nublar where their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) works. After ten years of operation Jurassic World has relied on new attractions every couple years to keep the visitors coming back for more. This time they create a hybrid dinosaur from gene splicing. Owen (Chris Pratt) works with the velociraptors on the island and is brought over to check out the containment center where the hybrid is kept. This is where the story picks up. And for the majority of the film it keeps a good pace with an entertaining story and decent dialogue. Chris Pratt is the stand out in the film and continues to show that he can carry an action flick. The movie starts to dip toward the end and you are left with the feeling that the writers didn't know how to end it. The film did so good for almost the entire film, but what you're left with is a jumbled final act. That doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching, but tailor your expectations for a complete package. It will sure to impress and is well worth seeing, but as far as rankings go it deserves a 7 at best.",Jurassic World
485,snaidu422,Deja Vu World,5,17 June 2015,"Stepping into a cinema showing ""JURASSIC WORLD"" is like stepping into a carnival and waiting anxiously to get on to the ferris wheel, you have been on it before, you know what to expect, but still you would want to go in for the ride. First timers may feel the ride to be awesome, but to you it would just be something you just had to do.This is exactly the problem with the new movie in the Jurassic Series.You have seen it all, been through it all, so you are not surprised, by now you also know the different kinds of dinosaur species which exist and you also can predict what happens and how the movie gets to end.I am not saying it is a bad experience for the movie going audience, but it is not a WOW experience either. Jurassic World is a hybrid of the previous 3 Jurassic movies.Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the operations manager of Jurassic world says halfway through the film that to pique the audience's interest, new and improved attractions should be provided or else they would start losing interest in Jurassic world and that's what the filmmakers intended to do with this one, Each of the Jurassic series provided with a meaner and tougher beast then its predecessor.In this one, we have the the Indominus Rex(a hybrid of Abelisaurus,Carnotaurus,cuttlefish,Giganotosaurus,Majungasaurus,Rugo PS,tree frog,Tyrannosaurus Rex, and Velociraptor DNA), which means like the cuttlefish it can also camouflage itself and can hunt and chew its food like the T-Rex.Coming to the movie, we have two teenagers who are whisked to this Jurassic World while their parents are undergoing a nasty divorce. Zach and Gray are looking forward to meet their aunt Claire, who is the operations manager at Jurassic world. But Claire busy with the Indominus Rex hands them over to her assistant.The owner of Jurassic World Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) enlists the assistance of Owen (Chris Platt) to oversee the safety and vulnerable areas in the Indominus Rex Enclosure.The inevitable happens and The reptile breaks free and the two teenagers are trapped in the park. Claire and Gray set on a rescue mission to get the kids back, even while a team of experts is brought to hunt the reptile. Sounds familiar! It should, kids trapped, dinosaur breaking loose, killing people and rescue mission- weren't these the themes of the former 3 Jurassic movies.OK, the movie was predictable, but in its defense, it was not hammer and tongs, and The CGI was excellent, there are enough thrills to make you crush your popcorn pack.Bryce Dallas Howard is excellent as Claire, and the way she switches from a professional corporate executive thing to a worried aunt is commendable. The scene where she shows Owen that she is ready for any eventuality is hilarious and she managed to get the timing right when she flees from the Indominus Rex and ignores Owen's hand for help.Chris Pratt is no great shakes as the heroic Owen, there is something missing in his characterization that we do not even mind when Claire takes over completely from him and carries the movie on her shoulders.Irrfan Khan's role was more of an extended cameo, and he managed to steal the thunder with whatever little screen time was allotted to him. Wished there was more of him.Kevin Stitt's editing was crisp and that contributes a lot in making this predictable movie interesting.John Schwartzman's Cinematography was good and the way the opening scenes were captured was excellent.Colin Trevorrow managed to direct this one with whatever material he had on hand and using the preceding movies as a kind of bible to take things forward. Wish he collaborated with a better script writer to come up with a novel theme rather then dishing out leftovers.If you ask me to rate this one, I guess I would go in for 2.5, watch it if you have nothing else to do and if you still do want to take a ride into the Jurassic era, I recommend watching JURASSIC PARK once again.",Jurassic World

The Lost World and JP3 were good follow- ups, but nowhere near the quality of the original. Yes, I said Jurassic Park 3 was good, all you haters out there. It was not a great movie, but short, fun, and to the point. It did not deserve all the hate that it got. The fourth entry in the series ties the second and third movies, in my opinion. Better in certain aspects, worse in others. It is a fun-filled action romp, but lacks depth, character development, and plot. It far surpasses any of the first three films in terms of visual effects, as it should, I mean we are in 2015, not 1993. That, and the fact this movie cost twice as much to make as any of the others. The plot is stupid, to say the least. If you can call it a plot. A theme park is reopened after the disaster 20 years before, with the same results, just worse, with a much higher death toll. Villain Hoskins wants to use tamed raptors for the military. Workaholic hero Claire doesn't spend enough time with her family. Raptor tamer Owen is the only one who sees the storm coming when Claire announces the new hybrid dinosaur, Indominus Rex. Oh yeah, and Owen and Claire have a love-affair-sort-of thing going on. Claire's two nephews are visiting the park, and are upset about their parents divorcing, which by the way we never find anything out about in the end. That being said, this is great fun to watch. Dinosaurs stomping around causing mayhem and destruction while enjoying chasing and feasting on the 20,000 plus park visitors. The final showdown between the Indominus, the raptors and the T-rex is EPIC! I'm sure since this movie broke records already in its first week at the box office, there will be more sequels to follow. Which is fine. I'll just go into them expecting nothing more than a typical Hollywood film- carnage and mayhem, overtaking plot and characters.",Jurassic World

On the other hand, Jurassic World works relatively well as a separate movie and it does happen to add a few cool new visual elements in comparison with its predecessors and the sci-fi standards of the 1990s. The special effects are just as impressive as the scenery, even though the latter makes for another visual element that is virtually identical to what had already been seen in the original trilogy.Although the characters are not very original, the performances turn out to be pretty good for the most part of the film's running time and Jurassic World does not feel very long for a movie that runs for a full two hours, despite the fact that there do happen to be some less exciting stages in the presentation of its story.",Jurassic World

Not professional at all. 
Probably even Spielbergs grandkids making better sounds when plays with plastic dinos I guess.

Monster ends in the aquarium with giant watermonster.

Now, the park is open again for Jurassic World – but does this long- awaited sequel recapture the same magic?Not quite, although Universal Pictures and director Colin Trevorrow certainly make a valiant attempt. Wisely ignoring the events of the second and third films in the franchise, Jurassic World takes place approximately twenty years after the original. Isla Nublar is now home to a sprawling resort that has been operating successfully for years – something like a combination of Disneyland and an animal safari park, but with the giraffes and elephants replaced by lumbering herbivores like triceratops and stegosaurus. There's even a Sea World-esque attraction where visitors can watch a mosasaurus burst out of the water to devour its dinner before splashing down and soaking the first few rows of spectators.Jurassic World follows many of the same beats as the original film, but manages to never seem as though it's trying to replicate its predecessor. There are numerous homages to some of the most iconic scenes from Jurassic Park – some are clever winks to the die-hard fans, and some are very blatant references – but the near-constant fan service is a very welcome detail.Regrettably, the movies falls a bit short in some places, not the least of which is the truly awful dialogue. We got a few glimpses of this in some of the film's trailers and TV spots, and viewers hoping that the most cringe-worthy moments were already revealed in the marketing will be in for some disappointment. Chris Pratt – so charismatic and charming in last year's Guardians of the Galaxy – is saddled with some of the worst bits, spending most of the film as a walking exposition machine. But co-star Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't fare much better, and most exchanges between their two characters will have eyes rolling toward the ceiling.Another truly puzzling aspect of Jurassic World involves a bizarre subplot with an InGen employee (Vincent D'Onofrio) hoping to turn a velociraptor research study into a military training program, wherein the raptors could be conditioned to follow commands and be sent into war zones in place of ground troops. It's a completely ludicrous notion, and everything associated with this idea could easily have been excised from the film without losing anything important.And while I understand the theme park is modeled after real-world locations with real-world business arrangements, there is an absurd amount of product placement in this film. At one point, after Claire (Howard) shows off the facility's research lab to a group of corporate representatives hoping to sponsor an upcoming attraction, she muses about having ""Verizon Wireless presents"" on the marquee. There's also the opulent Samsung Innovation Center, towering above the resort's hub area much like Cinderella's Castle at Disneyland, not to mention a slew of retailers and eateries that would be much more at home in a shopping mall than a theme park.Aside from those admittedly large stumbling blocks, Jurassic World delivers pretty much everything fans could ask for. The number and variety of the dinosaurs has increased vastly over the original film, and the creatures are once again created through a combination of animatronics and CGI for a stunningly lifelike experience. And of course, there's the Indominus Rex, the park's first genetically engineered hybrid, which serves up most of Jurassic World's thrills and chills through a number of white-knuckle action scenes.Audiences expecting Trevorrow and Universal to redefine the genre should probably temper their expectations before purchasing a ticket. The film is hampered by some major script issues that should have been addressed long before the cameras began to roll, but they're not enough to keep the experience from being enjoyable, and fans of the original film – and even its terrible sequels – should find plenty to love about Jurassic World.",Jurassic World
495,elizabeth-12994,Great,8,1 July 2018,"I thought this was a great movie. It was funny and everyone played such convincing characters. The storyline was well thought out and really worked, making a superb film. Chris Pratt was phenomenal in this movie. I thought the whole Jurrasic World park was very detailed and made you believe it was a place as it wasn't like a fantasy world where you have flying cars and stuff, if you know what I mean. The story line was definitely advanced and expanded on and am glad I saw this movie. It is for everyone so if you get time, I'd watch it. I've seen it many times and is an easy film to love.",Jurassic World
496,a-little-squeek,Enough already,3,14 January 2016,"I'm hoping that this will be the final sequel in the franchise. For my taste, it has outlived it's interest level. The film plays like ""look what we can do now with CGI and the concept of genetic manipulation"". It was boring, trite, predictable and overly contrived. Story line lacked dynamic appeal. Acting sub par. The CGI was good but one would expect it to be given advancements in technology to date. Over all a disappointment and in my view, the worst installment in the series even surpassing Jurassic Park 2 for that spot. I guess that it wold be a reasonable rental for a$1.50 at Redbox if your're having trouble with insomnia or if you're looking to complete the viewing of the whole franchise. Beyond that I think it would be fair to say that this film fell far short of my expectations.",Jurassic World
497,agblum,"At times Entertaining, at times Uneven.",7,14 June 2015,"""Jurassic World"" is the 4th movie in the ""Jurassic Park"" Series, and the first, since ""Jurassic Park III"" in 2001, and it takes part 22 years after the first ""Jurassic Park"", which came out in 22 years ago – in 1993. Like the other films, this one is led by an ensemble cast. Basic Set-up: Brothers Zach Mitchell (HS Age), played by Nick Robinson, and Gray Mitchell played by Ty Simpkins (Appears to be Pre-Teen to early Teen-Harley Keener in Iron Man 3) go to visit their Aunt Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is the Operations Manager of ""Jurassic World"" a theme park of Real Dinosaurs on Isla Nublar in Costa Rica – first envisioned in the first movie by the character of John Hammond. Another main player is Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt (Peter Quill/Star-Lord of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and Andy Dwyer of TV's ""Parks and Recreation""), a Velociraptor expert and trainer. Like the previous movies, as you can imagine, things will go array with the Dinosaurs, and chaos ensues. Like the previous films, the Special Effects, particularly the Dinosaurs, are first rate. The cast, which is good mix of races, generally do a good job. The two young boys I thought were outstanding, not a surprised with Simpkins, who was I felt was also so in ""Iron Man 3"", 2 years back. While slow at the start, Bryce Dallas Howard improves as the movie goes goes on. Pratt, does admirably playing a character that is not at all a carbon copy of ""Star Lord/Peter Quill"" from ""Guardians of Galaxy"" which released last summer, heightened him to super stardom – And he got the role prior to ""Guardian's"" release. Overall, while at times the film is entertaining, it is also at times uneven, trying to do the dual stories of overall the Mitchell family aspect, involving the parent, and the dynamic of Howard character and her sister – the boys' mother, and the plot line of how things go array with the Dinosaurs in this installment. Both plot lines, particularly the family aspect, could have been developed more, and be executed more evenly. and there are a 1 or 2 moments which just didn't fit. With that said, it still entertains you a great deal of the time. It's an improvement over the last film the series, and overall I would rank it third behind the first one, and ""The Lost World – Jurassic Park"". 2 ¾ Stars out of 4 – 7 ½ out of 10 Stars.",Jurassic World
498,life-of-hapiness,Loved This,10,26 August 2018,Having never seen any of the Jurassic Park movies I thought I would take a change with Jurassic World and I am so glad I did as I loved this movie. I love that the film was already set up so that the action could take way near the film and had the chance of seeing how it would expand thorughout the park and how the dinosaur was created. A brilliant film which I am glad I watched,Jurassic World
499,pendenquejohn,"Boring, boring and boring...",2,12 September 2015,"Some technical aspects of the movie were particularly well fulfilled. The beauty of the sceneries, these drone like captions which were quite impressive and the rendering the dinosaurs is actually very well done and quite realistic. I tried to watch to movie without making reference to the past Jurassic parks and decided to handle it as an innovative product. Needless to say that I was deceived.The build up to the interesting part of the movie takes way too much time. This got me particularly bored for a good section. And when came the action scenes, I must admit that they were impressive even if you could read the story and the finale before the movie had even started. Something which brings me to the second point.I actually got also bored very quickly with the story which turned out to be particularly predictable and generic. You'll find all the classic action movie cliché. So I'll not be saying anything precise on that aspect.However, the most annoying element was the music during the different scenes like a way to force the spectator to feel or react in a certain way. I found those to be particularly tacky, invasive and annoying most of the times. Action movies should leave to the spectator a certain degree of liberty with his feelings. Most of the action scenes were already quite impressive and did not require this useless addition.I found some of the acting to be particularly bad. Anyways, as far as certain characters go. Bryce Dallas Howard was not particularly convincing in the role of a boss and neither was she convincing in the role of a ""Tomb Raider"" like adventuress and neither was she convincing in a more emotional role. In resumé, I found her to be quite useless when she was painted as the main character to lead the movie with Pratt.Add to the fact that she was running in a forest all throughout or running away from dinosaurs like Usain Bolt in high heels without them breaking ever. I mean, any woman that would realistically do that would have her feet completely bummed. That alone just does not make sense at all.Even when she tried to revolt, she just did not seem all that credible. The law and order cast was kind of surprising -- and, Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio actually played his role quite well since I was only really accustomed with him in the series. BD Wong though was probably a little less convincing. He does not seem to have a huge acting palette (though I would have to see him in other movies).Finally, Omar Sy, this was a difficult movie for him. He's a very good actor in that comic type of role and this one did not have a lot of space for him to express his talent. I found him to be particularly invisible and relegated to some sort of cheap 5th hand role when he could do and be much better than that.I really wanted to see this movie but I can't help but feel after watching it a sentiment of bore. Hence the 2/10.",Jurassic World
500,dp-17275,Meh?,6,28 February 2019,"Colin Terverrow's, 'Jurassic World' is a wasted opportunity. By all means the film isn't bad, just okay. The story feels like a retread of the first 3 movies, and hardly anything original is done in this flick. The acting is very good and the characters are extremely likable which Trevorrow is very good at, creating likable characters. Christ Pratt is a modern day Indiana Jones in this flick, he is very good and very fun. Bryce Dallas Howard is a lot of fun as well. The newcomer children actors are watchable until the 'divorce' subplot is introduced randomly. The music is excellent by Michael Giacchino, the new John Williams. The dinosaurs are fun for the first half when they are just being shown off, but become nonsensical in the films final battle. Far too many references to the original Jurassic Park, great acting, an annoying divorce subplot and a pointless military subplot, fun humor, nice visuals, a lackluster story. The die hard Jurassic Park fans will praise it, but the average movie goer can still have fun with this one. I do recommend this one",Jurassic World
501,SnowLeopardMaster,"Good, but in some ways bad",8,9 May 2018,"I have mixed feelings about Jurassic World. In some ways, it was great to see the dinosaurs again in a brand new story, with new action scenes, and new deaths.On the other hand, hybrids... I will probably never be okay with Jurassic World's inclusion of the Indominus Rex hybrid. It was a cool idea, but I don't like it. The indominus, in my opinion, was just unrealistic, and too overpowered. It has been confirmed that Giganotosaurus DNA was present in the indominus, and i think Giganotosaurus would have made a much better antagonist.Similarly, I have mixed feelings about the premise of raptors being trained. it was a cool idea, but it watered them down way to much, making them seem like guard dogs instead of the terrifying killers they were established as in the previous films. However, it was still sad to see Charlie, Echo, and Delta go. The emotion and sadness as such a prominent theme was one of my favorite parts about this movie. I also liked the Pterosaur escape scene, and my favorite creature in this movie was probably the mosasaurus. It's definitely a fun movie worth watching, but it fails to surpass the previous movies.",Jurassic World
502,pulikd,Jurassic Park IV. The T Twenty One Thousand,6,27 July 2021,"A couple of kids are going to the finally functional Dinosaur Park while their parents are about to divorce. Right from the beginning, this movie isn't afraid to be somewhat different than what came before. Unlike every previous installment in the franchise, ""Jurassic World"" doesn't open with somebody getting hurt or killed by dinosaurs. That is fresh.The kids arrive and begin enjoying the park. Only this part of the movie isn't long. The movie cannot do without yet another story of dinosaurs breaking free and wreaking havoc. Those two kids could be the basis for the whole picture. One of them is clearly not enthusiastic about the park itself, he's basically there to watch over his little brother. The plot could have focused on them and how they go from one attraction to another, exploring their relationship as brothers. The young actors weren't bad at all, and the movie could have done more with them. But it does not.Dinosaurs, apparently, are no longer interesting for crowds of people, even though the park is clearly packed with visitors. But the movie states that the popularity isn't big enough. What you see and what you are told are incompatible, they contradict each other. Regardless, the scientific division has come up with a solution. They have genetically engineered a new species of dinosaur. It is bigger than the T Rex and it has several superpowers. First, it can hide its thermal signature from the tech designed to monitor it. But the creature only uses it once. Second, it can camouflage. But the creature only uses it once throughout the whole film. Regardless, the new dinosaur breaks free and trouble is imminent.Owen, an ex-military and now an animal handler, and his ex-girlfriend Claire, who is now running the park, must find a solution to this crisis. Also, the two kids from the beginning are her nephews. Also, there are people that want to use dinosaurs in wars. The third movie had a very simple plot, too simple, perhaps. The fourth one is the other way around. It has too many elements to deal with. They do not have enough time to shine. All of this material feels like it could be two movies instead of one.So, the plot does deserve criticism. What also deserves it is how the movie handles death scenes, which is worse than ""The Lost World"". The new super carnivore is interesting. And it isn't the only addition to the carnivore arena. Herbivores are also there, and they have more screen time than in the third film. The cast and the performances were good. What was bad about them is, again, how they were handled. They simply needed more space to breathe. The movie is packed. Visual effects were good, definitely better than the last time.And finally, the franchise chooses to have most of the action take place at daytime, and totally avoid rain. The visuals, in general, were very pleasant, by the way. Only the plot is highly problematic. It wants too much and it does not avoid serious mistakes.",Jurassic World
503,john_seater,"Seen one, seen them all",2,21 June 2015,"Let's start right off with the spoiler: There is a dinosaur park on an island, the containment system breaks down, dinosaurs get out, people get eaten (including some bad guys). Wait. Didn't I just describe the original Jurassic Park and more or less all the others? Yup, sure did. There is nothing, NOTHING, original in this film except a few negligible tweaks on previous Jurassic plots.What sets this one apart is the new low in the dialog and the acting. The dialog is idiotic beyond description. Routine, silly, predictable, overdone, ... Wait. I'm giving it too much credit because I said beyond description, so let's leave it at that: beyond description. The acting ranges from nothing special to terrible. The prize for most terrible goes to Bryce Dallas Howard, who cannot act to save her life. She seems to think that routine swagger and pre-teen gestures convey character and emotion. She cannot even pronounce standard English: ""Walcome to Jurassic World,"" ""year over year ravenue continues to build,"" ""higher than aver,"" ""our DNA axcavators discover new species avery year,"" ""learned more from genatics in the past dacade than a santury of digging up bones,"" ""the Indominus rax,"" just to take examples from the first 10 minutes of her appearance on screen.Despite all its flaws, the movie provides an amusing diversion if you are tired and just want to park yourself in front of the tube or your monitor and be entertained by brainless, predictable action. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1.",Jurassic World
504,fabiolpinheiro1993,Awesome sequel that is quite an impressive spectacle.,9,11 June 2015,"So today i saw Jurassic World on IMAX 3D and... I loved it, really loved it. I wasn't expecting something as good as the first because that would be just unreasonable. I Know that everyone hates the sequels, but i am a true fan of the entire franchise not just the first, and i love Lost World, and i will never understand all the hate it has, but everyone has their opinion. So i was expecting something that had the action and thrills of the sequel and the wonder and magic of the original and... The film has a very cool opening, but it's not the usual opening sequence, and it's a very nice change, it has a very good first hour, where we meet the new characters, the park, and establish the story. Its very exciting, and i love the new...Characters: Chris Pratt doesn't shine as he could but he's a very good character, has that something that makes him very likable. But i think the real star of the show is Bryce Dallas Howard, she is great, and has a good development, the only one by the way, since only she and Nick Robinson evolve as characters. So him and Ty Simpkins are great too, i love that they are much more independent than the original kids. Vincent D'Onofrio, is a good character but nothing special, the same with Irrfan Khan. Now Jake Johnson is great, but as with almost every character i wanted to see a lot more, i would develop this characters a lot more, and make them appear more. (BD Wong of course makes a good if nothing special cameo). The Story: It has a very good premisse, since i always wanted to see the park finally open and how would that actually be. I have to say that its just magic, they created the perfect park, seeing John Hammond's dream come true is just magic, full of wonder and excitement. They were very creative and created a park that is very unique in its structures, attractions and transports. But they only show us tiny bits of a lot of things, and i think they should have explored the park a lot more, we should have seen the attractions through the visitors perspective. This would have made the film better, because if the premisse is the park being finally open, this should be much more explored. The indominus Rex is just perfect, its scary as hell, and the plot is pretty much all about her. Which gives some great thrills and chills and overall it is a great story. The raptors plot is just awesome, and i loved everything about it. It was very original and surprising. The Nods: There's tons of nods to the original film, and its just great seeing them through the entire film, i think this was what i loved more, they just paid a huge homage to the original film, but in such a great way that it feels natural and exciting. The action: Well its very good, and once the mayhem starts it never stops. But i really would love to see a lot more of the mayhem, because another great thing about the park being open is that it can have a lot more ways to create mayhem. There's many awe moments, and it is very intense. A lot of people die in such magnific ways, it's incredible. The climax is just awesome, epic. The visuals: Just awesome, i loved the cinematography, the production design, everything. The camera-work is also great, while sometimes i would make some wider shots, its very distinctive, and this just looks awesome on IMAX 3D, feels so epic. There's a lot of great scenery. As for the visual effects, they are breathtaking, but i don't think they are better than the originals, but either way, they are terrific and the raptors are the better visual effects in the film. the way they move is epic. Other technical aspects: The score is just great, and while its very much Michael G. it could very well pass as a john Williams score. It incorporates the original themes very well. The sound it's just terrific, very very good.Overall: This is a very unique, original film, that has everything to be a huge success, especially the fact that it feels so much different than everything else this summer, or the whole year, it feels fresh and distinctive. It has great visuals, some great thrills, great action, great story, great characters, a sense of wonder, but somehow i think i left the theater feeling it was missing something, i cant quite say what, but i do know that it should have something more. And the things i would change, would be to explore the characters and the park a lot more. Personally i put this sequel next to Lost world, but this is me, as to everybody i think it will be their favorite sequel. And is more that guaranteed a new sequel, and i hope many more. Also i think this is the only the second film of the year until now, that i think it deserves a second viewing in theaters. And if you can, watch it on the biggest screen possible, because it feels epic.",Jurassic World
505,avik-kumar-si,Jurassic World's real monsters lie beneath the dino-action,8,22 June 2015,"The first time you hear that soundtrack play and the expansive visuals take shape before your eyes on the big screen, you feel having broken even. Your ticket prices recovered, you tighten your seat belts for some fun. Jurassic World gives you that fun. Some of the tricks are old, some are just nods to its predecessors while some of the others are new, because theme-park visitors and movie-goers alike like new tricks - cooler, more thrilling shows. And this is where Jurassic World takes off, turning the mirror onto itself - to the world it lives in, highlighting how similar it is to the one it needs to recreate. Hidden in the foliage of the on-screen monsters, their rampaging and battling, adventures of lost siblings, teeth-gnashing villains and chase sequences lies in the tale of Jurassic World scathing observations and frank introspections on business, politics and ethics. The performances are okay, the storyline simplistic, the set-pieces a mixture of novelty and deja vu, but what rescues the sequel from being a strictly average me-too movie is its courageous take on itself. In the process, Jurassic World, by turning the metaphorical into the physical, serves as a stern warning to us, confident homo sapiens of the age of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Genetic Engineering. Wisdom and knowledge are two separate entities, advancement and progress as apart as the Jurassic Age from the Nuclear Age. Jurassic World makes the point by laying bare the gap, as eloquently as the roar of synthetic monsters in a make-believe island of a family entertainer allow. Kudos to Colin Trevorrow and team for that!",Jurassic World

507,the_horned_owl,"Better Than Jurassic Park 3, But Totally Predictable",6,10 June 2015,"**spoilers ahead.** I am a great fan of Jurassic Park. I loved it when I watched it in 90s but it was a new concept back then. It had a great story and some of the best visuals at that time. It was not completely predictable and it was fun.Fast forward 22 years and we have ""Jurassic world"". The story picks up after 22 years of Jurassic Park. I am not going into the details of the plot, but it is almost similar to the original Jurassic Park. We have a park where people can come and see the genetically modified dinosaurs. One of them escapes and goes berserk. Now Chris Pratt has to stop him from causing more destruction. So there is nothing new in terms of story.It is similar to some of the other movies that we have already seen.The CGI looks really good but these days even a low budget film has some really nice graphics work. But if you are a fan of 3D, you will have some fun as it has got some really scary scenes and the effects are amazing.It is predictable yet enjoyable. Chris Prett does a great job. In fact, he is the only person in the movie who is likable. I did not care about other characters.Now let's talk about the negatives. There are so many things that are wrong with this film. But I have made a list of the things that don't make sense. I am not going to talk about the technical things because everything is good except for the BGM. 1- Who enters a dinosaur's territory without knowing where the Dinosaur is? they could have tracked him before entering the cage, just to be sure. and Did I mention that we are talking about a genetically modified dinosaur with the IQ of Einstein?2- The character played by Judy Greer and Bryce are so annoying. Judy starts crying for a stupid reason ( because her sister didn't accompany the children, she works in Jurassic World, she has a lot of work to do.)3 - Bryce does not know what logic means. There are moments where she shows her STUPIDITY. (Like - ""screaming"" even though she knows that the dinosaur could hear her voice.)4 - The kids are the most stupid ones I have ever seen. I mean you are in Jurassic World. If there is an emergency then it must be something important. Get the hell out of there. But no, we have to see everything.5- Who the hell designed this stupid spherical vehicle that the kids used? Dinosaurs could have easily destroyed it, One swing of their tail and it would China. who wants to travel in such a vehicle?6- Chris Pratt and Bryce go out to find the children and their defense is - A GUN. What? Are you going to kill that Dinosaur with a GUN?7- Chris and Bryce see some dead or soon-to-be- dead dinosaurs so they make sure that they waste a lot of time with them albeit they have to save the children and time is running fast.8- Chris goes out to kill the dinosaur with a team, but only one of them has a Bazooka. Then they wait for the Dinosaur to have some giggles with the small dinosaurs. They could have brought 5-6 Bazookas with them and launch them at the same time. We saw what 1 Bazooka did to him. 5-6 could have easily killed him or at least crippled him.9- What the hell is the deal with those 4 dinosaurs who keep changing sides?10- I honestly could not understand what Chris Pratt's role was? He did not do anything in the whole movie except for running. He was useful at only one place - The climax. He somehow hypnotizes the small dinosaurs, but even that doesn't do anything.11- The Dues ex machina Ending. (A big Dinosaur saves the day). Maybe I am nitpicking but these are the examples of sloppy writing. You must avoid such things. Some scenes reminded me of Avatar and the climax reminded me of Godzilla.Overall it is a nice movie to pass your time but it is not a must watch. It does not get anywhere near to the level of Spielberg's original Jurassic Park. but yeah, It is a great improvement over Jurassic Park 3 which was a complete mess.",Jurassic World

It's suspenseful, funny and sometimes quite scary.22 years after the jurassic park disaster, jurassic world is running in good order but to boost revenue for investors, the park scientist begin breeding genetically enhanced monsters to spike the parks earnings creating another recipe for disaster.The real stars once again are the dinosaurs in this flick and there are excellent performances from the cast.

Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid",3,11 February 2018,"Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me.

Initially I feared the worst and for the first fifteen minutes that fear was founded. The opening sequences are to put it mildly, awful. After that however the film is a big roller coaster ride, it is not a remake, it does have respectful references to the original. Yes, it's contrived, very much so at times, but it has some exciting and well done sequences. For me it was on a par with the first two films and a vast improvement over ""Jurassic Park 3"". Very good 9/10.",Jurassic World

512,JonSnowsMother,can be easily dissected by nit-pickers but it knows its place and that is what makes it a fun action packed experience with some bite.,4,4 July 2015,"After spending over a decade stuck in development hell the long awaited Jurassic Park IV has finally made it to cinemas under the guidance of up and coming director Colin Trevorrow and re-boot specialists Legendary Pictures (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Godzilla) with the more suitable title Jurassic World. But is it worth the wait? Well it was for Universal the film stomped into theatres and looks set to break into the prestigious billion-dollar club in box office gross. Benefiting the relentless marketing campaign which included a mock and very impressive Jurassic World website highlighting the impressive attention to detail put into the park. As for the quality of the film it may not be able to match the original, but it is certainly the superior of the three sequels. The main distinction between Jurassic World and its lesser counterparts The Lost World and Jurassic Park III is that Jurassic World poses the same the same theme which was the main driving force of both the first instalment and Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, a theme best explained by Dr. Ian Malcolm's memorable quote ""You were too busy asking if you could, you never stopped to ask if you should"". The park is run by Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), an eccentric Richard Branson like billionaire and the only returning character Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) who serves as a modern day Victor Frankenstein. Both could have served as exciting representatives of the dangers of capitalism and science but instead they are pushed aside for the typical all American action hero. This could had been a problem if it wasn't taken over by the always lovable Chris Pratt who has further cemented himself as the hottest star in Hollywood.As for the other characters they are rather one dimensional and undeveloped. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the conventional stubborn businesswoman, Claire, who predictably evolves into being humane, while her sister Karen (Judy Greer) spends the majority of her limited screen time back in the United States crying and worrying over her sons (this is even before the Dinosaurs start rampaging across the island) while her two children serve as the Tim and Lex stand in's. They are in the form of Zach (Nick Robinson) who is your typical hormonal teenager constantly using conveniently labelled electronic products and his dinosaur obsessed nerdy little brother Grey (Ty Simpkins). The biggest disappointment however is the clichéd human antagonist Vic Hoskins played by the wasted Vincent D'Onofrio who plays a bad guy whose bad for the sake of being bad. Hoskins is Ingen's head of security whose plan is to weaponise the raptors trained by Pratt's character Owen, at no point is his plan a secret as it's the first subject he talks about. The character of Hoskins is paper-thin and is a character more suited to a 90's family film, a certain Brian Blessed voiced hunter springs to mind. The plot involving Hoskins is part of too many undeveloped subplots that only add to the run time as opposed to the story. The main culprit is when while on Jurassic World's monorail Grey begins to randomly cry over the likelihood of his and Zach's parents getting a divorce, this subject is never bought up again failing to capitalise on adding any depth to the brothers. These uneventful subplots are likely the consequence of too many scriptwriters working on the screenplay. Four screenwriters are credited, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, served as the original screenwriters while Trevorrow and his Safety Not Guaranteed partner Derek Connolly later stepped in for the final draft, four very talented screenwriters, but all likely to have clashed during pre-production. But as any fan of the Jurassic Park franchise should know the real stars are the dinosaurs and boy they don't disappoint. The Indominus Rex is a breath of fresh air, which was lacking in the other sequels. She serves as not just a good threat to the park and its inhabitants but also a solid representation of the dangers of science. While the other ""assets"" in Jurassic World consist of the monstrous Jaws eating Mosasaurus and the previously underused Pterodactyl's, both of whom are most welcome and give the film a sense of individuality. While the 'old school' Raptors and T-Rex make more than just fan service cameos and even become integral to the main plot, even the biggest cynics will struggle to smile when the T-Rex and raptors are on screen. Trevorrow shows that he is capable of taking on such a high profile production, Jurassic World may be lacking the personality which made his indie-sci-fi-comedy debut Safety Not Guaranteed such a delight but this is a film which despite its flaws is made by people who are clearly passionate about this franchise and it will certainly appeal to fans of the original and introduce it to younger generations.",Jurassic World

Everything was made after the typical remake recipe in it's most blatant way: bigger, louder & more. And just as well you can't camouflage that stupid attempt of a pure cash in, the plot itself makes no bones of it either: they engineered new dinos with only one perspective in mind, to make them bigger, louder & more.Even with the walnut brain of a T-Rex you immediately get a glue, what the movie is all about. And you get what you expect: machine guns & rockets against accidentally made mutant dinos. Even more than that, in an absurd He-man-ish scenery, the hero and brain mutated battle raptors are going to meet the XXL-Rex for an epic final fight. Silver helmets for the raptors with antennas would have completed this B.S. perfectly. Where are the action figures?What's next in the franchise?

515,shadowyx12,Finally! A 'Jurassic Park' movie that finally hearkens back to the original film.,6,13 June 2015,"'Jurassic World' takes place 22 years after the events of 'Jurassic Park'. In this movie, we see that a fully functional and hugely popular dinosaur-themed park has replaced Hammond's failed theme park. However, since the park is suffering from a decline in visitors, the scientists at Jurassic World are tasked to create a brand new dinosaur (Indominus Rex) to help bring up numbers. Of course, things go wrong once again - and a group of employees are forced to stop the newly created dinosaur.To me, 'Jurassic World' feels like a retread of 'Jurassic Park' - only with higher stakes. That being said, there are elements in the script (from the characters, to the plot, and even certain moments and scenes) that don't feel all that fresh. Aside from Chris Pratt's character, Owen Grady, none of the other human characters were all that memorable. I also found myself caring very little about the family conflict that the two Mitchell Brothers were going through (which the movie itself paid very little attention to). If the human characters were actual people instead of reused stereotypes, then maybe I would have cared a little more about the movie.Actually, now that I think about it... the script also contains PLENTY of plot points that the movie never bothers to mention again! Maybe they'll be addressed in the sequel?Who cares! Because...DINOSAURS! ...Which don't look all that believable when compared to what Spielberg and his team accomplished 22 years ago. Seriously, I'm not saying that the visual effects are bad (they're oftentimes quite believable), but I wish that Trevorrow didn't rely solely on CGI to bring to life the beloved beasts. Even today, the animatronic/CGI dinosaurs we see in 'Jurassic Park' still hold up! I can only imagine how much better the dinosaurs would look if the same method was applied for this movie!'Jurassic World' delivers heavily on the suspense, action, and thrills one would typically expect from a 'Jurassic Park' movie. Although there are a lot more intense fight sequences this time around (and not just between dinosaur and dinosaur), I never once got exhausted by what I was seeing. The movie is well-paced and the screenwriters knew just when to deliver the movie's WOW moments.Despite its lacklustre script, 'Jurassic World' is certainly a spectacle that demands to be seen on the big screen. The story may seem predictable and even trite at times, but if you're a fan of dinosaurs, mayhem, or giant monster fights, then check out 'Jurassic World'.",Jurassic World

517,Marthian80,Entertaining but more of the same,5,4 October 2016,"So it's 22 years after the first park failed it's test run, how does the new park hold up? We follow brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell on their visit to the park, where their aunt Claire Dearing is the park's operations manager. She leaves the boys in the hands of her assistant because she is to busy with the park latest attraction: a super predator named Indominus‍ rex. Claire asks the best ranger of the park, Owen Grady, to inspect the paddock of the Indominus rex but they find no sign of the creature. Can the new park handle this situation of a super predator on the run? And what's up with navy veteran Owen Grady who suggests to use the dinosaurs for military use? And are the brothers Mitchell safe? Jurassic world is basically the same movie as the very first one, only now the park has survived it's test runs and is open to the public. The park looks great on screen and you can imagine that this is the park that John Hammond had in mind in the first film.I liked Chris Pratt in his role as park ranger and Vincent D'Onofrio did a good job as well portraying the military involvement in the park. The brothers Mitchell were better left out of the film as there is no chemistry between them whatsoever. I had the feeling they are just there to have the Indominus rex something to chase and Chris Pratt something to rescue. And while the action scenes look great, it's just a run-of-the-mill predictable monster movie with nothing in it you haven't seen before. It also recycles a little bit to much from the first film, including being surrounded by raptors in the entrance building.To sum up: a mediocre popcorn flick that's entertaining to watch but nothing special.",Jurassic World

With some great moments made as an homage to the original, it has its light moments, its comedic moments, and its action, balanced well enough to carry an overused and predictable plot. Howard does a beautiful job as the powerful lead actress trying to control chaos and the consequent adaption required. And D'onofrio, as talented of an actor as he is, was a complete miss in character. His comically painted villainy is cheesy, cliché, and crosses the border into hilarity. It becomes so bad, it feels ironic and intentional.

I kept looking at my watch to see how much longer this movie was.Segments of the film are enjoyable,the music for the most part is moving,but the plot has much to be desired.The acting in parts is very weak aside from the younger boy whom I thought is a realistic young actor.The script was silly especially when one of the theme park tech workers is about to kiss his colleague and she says ""No,I have a boyfriend.""

Nothing new that we have not seen before. I would disagree with a lot of the reviewers that it was better than JP 3. Jurassic Park 3 still had some originality in terms of introducing the Spinosaurus to the public after the tried and tested T.rexes of the previous films, and the rather exciting entry and extended part played by the Pteranodons. Even the visuals concerning the flying beasts were quite exciting and innovative at that time. It still had some of the wild, jungle like quality and appeal of the original classic. This one seemed more like a trip to a dinosaur version of The Magic Kingdom! We deserved better in 2015 in terms of both the plot, storyline and ingenuity.

I love dinosaur movies and I loved all the old Jurassic Park movies. Although this movie (forgivably) lacks many of the elements that made the Jurassic Park movies so good, like a decent theme, a moral, and underlying character conflict, it also lacks characters that we can identify with or have any concern for. Even this might be forgivable, but at some points, the characters (portrayed rather flatly by incompetent acting/directing) act so idiotically, that I found myself actually hoping they would get what was deservedly coming to them, knowing that they probably wouldn't, and indeed they didn't. I find myself more tolerant of evil in a character, then just plain stupidity; and sadly, due to poor scripting, storyline, or directing, the main characters in this movie just came off as stupid, idiotic fools. While the CGI was fantastic, I really couldn't help but feel it didn't make up for having to suffer through 90 minutes of listening to vapid characters.",Jurassic World

It all seems like that awkward high-school prom, when everyone is trying so hard to act cool and/or natural.The continuing ""Dis"" on Costa Rica continues, with a shot at another airport masquerading as the Juan Santamaria airport in San José, and the use of the ""CR"" prefix on aircraft (which is NOT Costa Rica's prefix). In addition, the pilot is shown flying the helicopter from the left side, which is the opposite of real-life.A pretty mundane script, Although the show was still enjoyable to watch, for the action sequences.",Jurassic World
523,danielloe,"A very good movie; tension, humor, action, and good characters",8,17 June 2015,"*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Well, it's been fourteen years since the last Jurassic Park movie, but now, we finally get another one... and it was worth the wait. Look, I'm not going to act like this was better than the first one, or even as good, but this was still a good movie, and a whole lot of fun. It combined elements of all three of the previous films, and added their own ideas to the mix, and the combo really worked. This time around, we have a new dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which was pretty scary actually. It had camouflage, and wasn't fooled by lack of motion like the T-Rex was. They call out in the movie that the I- Rex is more powerful than the T-Rex, which immediately makes it feel more dangerous. We also see a fully armed attack team of soldiers take on the I-Rex, which we never saw with either the Tyrannosaurs or the Spinosaurus, which once again, makes it feel much more dangerous. If they just constantly thwart the same dinosaur, the movie loses the tension, but if you add in new dinosaurs, then it just keeps getting more and more tense. I also liked that they brought back the pterranadons (sorry if I'm spelling these names wrong) from JP 3, because I think having flying dinosaurs was a nice touch, and it gives us something smaller, that the heroes can fight back against. But now let's talk about the characters some, since without good characters, it's just watching dinosaurs run around and eat people. Again, these characters aren't quite like those from JP-1, but they're still pretty good. Chris Pratt does a good job of being Owen Grady, the raptor trainer. That was a really good dynamic, and Pratt obviously toned down his natural personality a bit, so the movie would still feel more serious, and he did that really well. He's still got the signature Pratt quips, but he's not just totally goofy. Bryce Dallas Howard also does a good job as the negligent Aunt Claire. She was also a totally new character, one more concerned with profit and attendance than nature, which was a really good twist on the typical JP characters, and they didn't make it out like she was evil just because she wasn't all about non-interference (yes, Lost World, you handled that message pretty poorly). Hoskins, the guy who wants to use the dinosaurs as military weapons, is also a good addition, if a bit clichéd. I like having a human character being featured as the side villain, so I appreciated his inclusion. The two kids gave surprising performances; their story was actually kind of touching, and they seemed to be decent actors. This is by far the most action packed JP movie to date. Soldiers with guns, pterodactyls on the loose, dinosaurs fighting each other, it was good. I liked seeing some more action, though the end fight with the T-Rex and the raptors ganging up on the I-Rex was... it was different. I'm not sure if I liked it or not, but it was a nice change of pace. There are so many character arcs and stories in this movie, I can't do them all justice, so I won't try, but they are handled well, and I appreciate that. The story itself though, that's handled very well. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It was refreshing to see a summer blockbuster that didn't have to set up for three of four sequels, and just told a story. There is one plot point that wasn't resolved, but that was a good touch, that way there is room for sequels, but there don't have to be (considering all the money this movie has made in its opening though, there will be sequels). In conclusion, Jurassic World was a very good movie; fun, tense, good action and characters, very good effects, and was a great follow up to the original classic.",Jurassic World
524,Shad_Critic,Mediocre but Great,7,12 October 2015,"There has been already four Jurassic movies. Jurassic World is my second favorite. It manage to become much much better than The Lost World and Jurassic Park III. For starters, the characters are almost memorable but likable. Except for the fat asshole that got eaten by one of the raptors. Anyway, the special effects were great, the dinosaurs looked more real with its improved CGI. I like the way it pays homage to the original Jurassic Park where Gray and Zach explores the old park. Other than that, the plot was really too tragic. I mean dinosaurs running/flying around freely on an island filled with people. Obviously a lot of people died in this movie than in the last three movies. The best part has got to be the fight between the T-rex from the first movie and the Indominus Rex. That's all for this one. In conclusion, Jurassic World is great but not as good as the original.

525,magical-kingdom,Jurassic World,3,27 June 2015,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** A predictable return to the Jurassic Park series. They should have left well enough alone. Having 200 people ferried to a remote island that's a certain death trap. For sure this is only a movie but this storyline.coupled with low grade acting felt ludicrous and bored me. True to form of every Jurassic film in the series, all hell breaks loose. However,this film introduces all new characters with nearly everyone of them giving inferior performances,even the children. In my opinion, bringing in some of the original leads to insure more interest and memory recall from the previous series would have been a wiser move. e.g. Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neil who brought dramatic tension to the films. The main character Chris Pratt was the only up to par actor but he lacked the sharp wit and intelligence of Goldblum's Ian Malcolm. Then there is the outstanding appeal of Sam Neill as Dr Alan Grant. Moreover,all the characters from Jurassic Park would have been an improvement over this cast.Dinosaur effects were okay except for Chris Pratt being an animal trainer who communicates with vicious,man-eating raptors,likened to a horse whisperer. While there were a few appealing moments it was overall disappointing,from the first film to this one.

The film also has some very irritating and boring characters, and the sometimes the plot seems to be rushed off and little bit off, and falls behind in the terms of tension, intensity and story build than the first original Jurassic Park movie, but all over the movie lives up to its expectations in some aspects and is appealing in its visual style and character performances.

529,darth_timon,Silly Fun,8,17 June 2015,"I've read a lot of reviews criticising Jurassic World's story, and yes, I dare say the plot is not the most solid (training raptors for the military, making new species of dino), but the film succeeds in what I would consider its primary mission - to entertain! This is a film about a dinosaur theme park - the very concept is heavily stretching the boundaries of disbelief - even the first film is ultimately guilty of this - yet so many people are up in arms about THIS film's plot! In terms of the actual film - well, technology has come a long way since the original 1993 film, so the dinosaurs look more impressive than ever, and the park itself is brought bang up to date, looking incredible. The scenes with the two kids were a little annoying - we're supposed to get a sense of family connections and therefore connect with their characters, but some of the scenes are a little unnecessary (such as them going off on their own, even after the order to return to the main park), and defy belief a little.Chris Pratt pretty much steals the show. He's flavour of the month right now and he certainly has charm and presence. Bryce Dallas Howard's character starts out being very much a by-the-numbers sort, not really appreciating the animals (or the park's visitors) for what they are. However, as the film progresses she becomes more likable (as she ditches her businesswoman persona to reveal a human being underneath).There are quite a few nice little nods to the first film. There's a guy wearing a Jurassic Park t-shirt, and the kids find the remains of the original park, where the new I-Rex repeats the roar that the T-Rex treated us to. The original jeeps put in an appearance as well.So all in all, the film treats us to a bit of nostalgia, it has fun, and the characters are in fact, quite likable. It won't win any Oscars and it doesn't have the most compelling plot ever made, but it's a great popcorn movie, which is what you want from a summer blockbuster!",Jurassic World

At the end of the day it is a welcome return to the summer blockbuster. The best film I have seen since Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and my favourite film alongside Zodiac this century. fast paced, great acting, super effects and monsters. No Jeff Goldblum thankfully so in my view better than all the first 3 films put together. BUT the best thing is Chris Pratt. He was great in Guardians of the Galaxy and now he carries the film manfully on his shoulders. Funny Sexy Clever Passionate and damn fine acting. It was 2 hours of thorough enjoyment. It won't win any Oscars but who cares about those films? Stop thinking about small inaccuracies and enjoy it for the thrill ride it is. ABSOLUTELY FAB!",Jurassic World
531,stereo_1999,Good acting and cgi....but storyline needed a lot of work,3,9 October 2015,"The actors and actresses did a great job with what they had which to be honest was a story with a myriad of plot holes and logic errors. First off the Indominus Rex's abilities seem to constantly change when it is convenient. One second it can sense thermal heat until the main character is under a car then it doesn't know where he is. Another time they continually mention it has a great sense of smell which Owen (Chris Pratt's character) needs to cover himself in gas to hide from it. Then once again when it isn't important to the story it can't smell them behind the jeep. Another skill that conveniently disappears is its ability to blend in to its surroundings. It was used two or three times then it never used it again. I also wonder why there wasn't there a evacuation procedure? Even if they could have perfect containment of the dinosaurs there are still times you will need to evacuate. Shoot even Disneyland has evacuation procedures and they don't have dinosaurs than can eat people in one bite. Why is so many enclosures made of glass? There were so many times I wondered why some of the carnivores (like the Mosasaurus) had only glass around it. They went under water to see the Mosasaurus and I saw nothing stopping it from getting the people except the glass. Then there is the Gyrospheres a ride where people drive these completely glass pods that let people in a area with the herbivores. Fist off how is that safe and why was there no automatic recall? Without automatic recall a person can be with the Dino's all day and would stop others from getting a chance to see the dinosaurs. Why doesn't Claire keep the gun she was using? While we are talking about Claire why would you get in a car and drive to call headquarters? Wouldn't it be best to call right away? I also didn't like the convenient bad signal when the Indominus Rex was about ready to attack. Does it have some electrical field around it that jams signals or something because I could understand once or twice but it was way overused. I also find it interesting that Clare was able to outrun a t-Rex on foot in heels when we know from the first film it could almost catch up to a car. The T-Rex also didn't eat the humans at the end which was completely baffling considering it was ready to eat. Also i wonder how they contained all the Dino's from the first films. It was never explained and yet surprisingly we find out it is the same place. I also felt no connection to most of characters so everyone that died had little impact and felt like they were added to die instead of having good character development. Ohh and the main characters decide it is a good time to kiss right in the middle of a dangerous moment where Pterodactyl are attacking people left and right. The two boys that were watching decide not to panic and ask who the guy was. I'm pretty sure most people would be looking for cover instead of nonchalantly kissing someone. There are more errors but I think this is enough. Also there is a lot of product placement in this movie that brings you out of the moment. The best thing that came from this movie is the ""How it should have ended"" youtube video.",Jurassic World
532,cosmicfish14,A Fun But Cheesy Thrill Ride,5,21 June 2015,"Well, this was a movie I kinda had to watch twice mostly because my first experience with the movie wasn't that great. So I watched it a second time and now I have slightly different opinions now.So to start with some basic opinions, I feel that Jurassic World is cheesy as hell, but it is still a lot of fun and a lot better compared to the other Jurassic Park sequels.Lets start off with the positives, the effects are pretty good. I love how some of the dinosaurs have a great presence in the scenes they are in, they feel like they are really there at times. Chris Pratt was good in the movie as well and had some good comedic scenes. But mostly the movie is just a really fun ride, its very enjoyable to watch.Now for the bad, there are a lot of kinda uninteresting characters in the movie, *cough* Obligatory child characters *cough*, and also some annoying ones as well. Another thing about the movie as a whole is that it is incredibly cheesy, cheesy to a whole new level at times, but it is kinda funny though. But the thing that annoyed me was this one character who had the great idea of wanting to militarize dinosaurs, which if it was just a joke then that would be fine, but they keep mentioning it and the character is just talking about nothing but that every time he is on screen he was just obnoxious. It was really satisfying to see him get eaten by the raptors also.So finally, Jurassic World was very fun but some of the aspects of the movie kinda make bad from a critical stand point, but it is still very enjoyable but not a good movie from a technical stand point.Final Score: 5.5/10",Jurassic World
533,PandoraProductions4,packs some punch but leaves a lot to be desired,7,14 August 2015,"Jurassic World takes us back to the beloved Jurassic Park franchise, and now the Park is open for business! People are flocking to the dinosaur theme park in droves, and now the dinos are just another tourist attraction for people to take pictures of. There is definitely room for satire here, giving this premise, but the movie abandons that early on that in favour of a more bombastic approach. Namely, a genetically engineered dinosaur escapes and kills things. The question now becomes how entertaining is all the destruction? In general, I'd say it's pretty enjoyable. There's a nice scene with a flock of bird dinos attacking the tourists (I particularly liked the older guy grabbing his drinks as he gets away). The dinosaurs look great. We know they're CGI, but it's good CGI, not like in the dreadful Jurassic Park 3. There is a fun chase scene with some raptors, and a great finale with the genetically engineered dinosaur squaring off against a T-Rex. Also, that thing in the water was awesome. In general, the scenes lack the composition and structure that made the first film in the series great, and the second film pretty good as well. There's not really any clever poetic moments that make you gasp at how good the film direction is. There's nothing that comes close to the kitchen scene in the first film. Most scenes are just: dinosaurs attacking, people run, more attack, more running, some hiding. There isn't this great sense of overall urgency to it. Perhaps this stems from the uninteresting characters. Chris Pratt is reliably good in his role, but his character lacks something, perhaps some back story. I dunno. The kids in the movie suck. Spielberg knew how to not only direct children, but also to cast ones that are compelling. These kids were boring and lacked any charisma, and whenever the movie focused on them I was cringing in my seat. Let's get back to the dinos, guys! Bryce Dallas Howard gave the best performance in the film by doing all her scenes in high-heels. I was happy to see Katie McGrath, who was great in BBC's Merlin, but was unhappy in how 1. Her role was tiny and 2. How she undeservedly got the most horrible death in the movie. If I was in charge of the film I would have made the uptight aunt (Dallas Howard) have the gruesome death, and made the British assistant (McGrath) the leading lady. Anyway, there is definitely enjoyment to be had from the film's' great visuals, though not so much from the weak characterizations and the generic scenes.",Jurassic World
534,RyanWinter100,Jurassic World--and excellent sequel,8,26 October 2017,"The Original 3 Star Wars films were super.The sequels, that were really prequels, were junk.Star Trek was great when it kept moving forward, when it started going backward in the story line it became junk too.Jurassic World--you have a good original story, and now a sequel that truly goes forward in the story time line in great style.Jurassic world is a terrific movie. It's loaded with tributes to the original film of more than 20 years ago. When you hear John William's majestic score, it paints beautiful images and moods in you. However, this story moves forward. And it does so in a tremendous production. All of the performers are excellent in their roles. Even the dinosaurs perform better. There is a human to dino sequence in this film that will bring most to tears. There are other creature to human relationships that are fascinating. And of course there are other meetings of the species that will terrify you. As with most sequels, the formula is known before the opening credits even begin. There will be monsters, screaming, death and destruction. But how it's packaged is extremely entertaining.I have seen so many films in my life that I, admittedly, am growing numb to them. But I found Jurassic World very watchable. Actually, it was so good, I've seen it quite a few times and I've enjoyed each experience.This is a good one!",Jurassic World

537,sweeeetmikey,hold on to your butts...once again,8,25 July 2015,"JURASSIC WORLD review by Mike Smith A new theme park is built on the original site of Jurassic Park. Everything is going well until the park's newest attraction, a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine, escapes containment and goes on a killing spree.I may have been one of few people who didn't want to see this movie but I'm glad I changed my mind! Just like the original film, Jurassic World is a fun ride and it has some great one liners but it's predictable.The cast is amazing; Chris Pratt is a cool bad ass in this film but in a way he plays this role like a Indiana Jones style character. He steals the show to the point where you don't care about anyone else. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire who from the start of the film you know is going to be the damsel in distress, which is a sad thing because I'd like to see a strong female character. She also is kind of a 2D character with no real personality which isn't Bryce Dallas Howard's fault. One person I would have liked to see more of was Jake Johnson, he is the comic relief but we don't see enough of him.One thing that made the original Jurassic Park groundbreaking was the practical effects. Jurassic World is over the top C.G. and uses very few practical effects which I would have liked to see more of. One more thing I loved about this film was all the homage and nods to the original film.All together Jurassic World takes after the original; it's exciting, fun, and a great time for the whole family but I found it to be forgettable.

538,MovieNinjaGuy,10 Things Jurassic World did right.,8,14 June 2015,"10 Things JW did right in my opinion:1. It didn't make women seem completely useless. Spielberg intentionally put a strong female character in JP after he made his own wife look completely useless in Temple of Doom. Bryce Dallas Howard helps towards the end (with a nice reference to Dr. Grant's actions in the first film) and isn't as useless as the woman protagonist in Godzilla for example who can't even answer a phone call.2. Having to wait a little while to see a proper Dinosaur in the film, just like JP. Instead the JP theme is effectively used to show the initial areas of the park (just like JP did with the island shots) rather than the awesomeness of a Dinosaur.3. The scale of the park is immense and much better thought out / explored than the first film. There is a hotel, areas where people can walk, merchandise areas, lines where people have to queue for rides. Ride operators who are a bit clueless because usually everything works perfectly, just like in a real park. It was very effective I thought.4. The actors seemed to be in danger during the film. Especially the kids in the gyro-sphere. This was similar to the T Rex attack at night in the original film. Compare this to useless Age of Ultron where it seemed like a play with a bunch of super heroes showing up with their awesome life styles and not having anything really to worry about even when Ironman behaves like an imbecile Dr. Frankenstein and just gets away with it. Mad Max is another great example of a recent movie where actors are in real danger and helps to make you feel more involved and not asleep like Age of Ultron did to me.5. Several dinosaur attack scenes effectively did not have any music. This worked well to create more suspense in the original T Rex attack in JP and was a great contrast when there is a lot of score used.6. The music was excellent and original themes were used well. Compare this to piece of crap Man of Steel resurrection which does not contain John Williams' leid-motif and is just utter crap, considering it is Hans Zimmer, it's really bad. Just drums and 5 piano notes. Not to mention everything else wrong with that utter horrendous film.7. Monster vs Monster fight. Kept to the point and nothing idiotic and long drawn out like in Godzilla (how did THAT director get a Star Wars gig?)8. Superb references to first film when remains of original park were shown, merchandise, tools, cars even to the exact location where Grant, Sattler, Malcolm where first overwhelmed when seeing a brachiosaurus. This time the film leads seeing a dying one because of a real monster the lab cooked up. Nice reverse of plot element I thought.9. Chris Pratt & Bryce Dallas Howard. Good leads and perfect for this film. They don't come with the baggage that some actors have. There was about as much background story to both them as there was to original leads in JP in my opinion. Only critique I have when Claire asks Owen what they should do at end of the film it would have been more fitting to have answered with ""we evolve""10. Final roar of T Rex on top of the helicopter pad before movie turns to black instantly. Great ending.",Jurassic World
539,cassidyorme,why is the writing so bad..,5,10 March 2016,"this movie has so many writers yet the dialog is terrible.. just terrible.. i get the feeling that the people who wrote this are the type of people that try to be funny but never ever ever ever ever make anyone laugh, and probably never have real conversations with people.. They really let Chris Pratt down too, his lines are weak.. not very charismatic, not very bad ass, sometimes sounding weak, ugh. if it wasn't for the dinosaurs and action this movie wouldn't even be worth your time. all the best parts are pretty much in the previews anyway except for the end. the part where the girl does up her shirt is pointless, I feel like they took out better scenes for that crap, if they had better scenes.. which i get the feeling they did.. like when Owen gives the speech about listening to him and doing what he says, and when she says what with an attitude he says just relax.. when that happened i thought that the movie skipped or a large part was cut out.. and you shouldn't feel that in a major box office movie but that isn't the only time you do.. ugh",Jurassic World

541,bbriddell,Dumb & Dumber,1,14 June 2015,"If you love 100% Hollywood films, then this is a crowning jewel.In a word the movie is Weird. After seeing it, I'm still unsure if the audience was a consideration. I'm reminded of one of the X-files episodes in which there was a ""freak"" show carnival and there were several good points about PT Barnum. All the excitement to see something and it's actually an exit door that slams behind you.What I didn't like: From the beginning the movie jumps around; which makes it hard to follow. Just because I feel sorry for crazy people doesn't mean I want to sit and listen to them for over an hour. It was the typical shot gun approach and came across as alienating the audience.This is good because we say it is. You went out of your way to see this. We have your money, now you can leave or suffer through the rest of this. Another sad remake that couldn't take the time to at least acknowledge that maybe it would not have been a bad idea to put some effort into making it good.What was good: Consistently lousy across the board; writing, directing, acting. If there was anything interesting that didn't keep my mind from wandering I'd note it; however, I cannot recall anything interesting.The effort I put into this review is more than was put into the movie.",Jurassic World
542,Simarium,Jurassic World,7,9 August 2018,"There are baad loose ends at the end. For one of them, why is Aunt Claire all fine when it was largely her fault that so many people died? Entertaining overall, but definite has some plot holes and nonsensical acting at times.",Jurassic World
543,SforSmile,"Dinosaurs Top, the Plot is a Flop.",6,18 June 2015,"After a feeble opening, the movie slowly turns into a suspenseful cat-and-mouse game (the people are the mouse in this game) until it ends with a fulminate dinosaur smack-down.When you're impatiently waiting for the disaster to happen so that finally the dinosaurs can take over the park and by that drive the plot into a basic run-for-your-life theme than it's a clear sign that all the blabbering in between is just an unexciting postponement of the inevitable carnage that follows and therefore just redundant.This sequel is so uncreative that it's actually a remake spiced with more violent horror elements and the latest 3D technology.The characters are all fulfilling stereotypical roles, there is not one really funny line, the only halfway unpredictable behavior comes from the dinosaurs, nevertheless the movie relies on the sensationalism of the audience who much like the visitors of the park are seemingly satisfied with the premise: ""It's roaring, it's big so it gotta be good!""What really intrigued me were the new dinosaur villain, the sea monster and the nasty pterosaurs which caused some thrilling incidents.4/5 pts. for action and effects. 2/5 pts. for story, inventiveness and drama/fun. total rating: 6 pts.",Jurassic World
544,trvlers-77920,5/10,5,25 June 2015,"It's silly of me, right? I have this notion that a big, splashy blockbuster should provide characters and story lines that matter, that engage us, so that there are actual stakes and not just a lot of noisy stomping. Theoretically, we should care whether or not someone is going to get eaten by a genetically engineered, 50-foot-tall dinosaur. We shouldn't be distracted by flimsy subplots, or the unlikely (and ungainly) sight of a grown woman running for her life through the jungle in high heels. And yet, this is what ""Jurassic World"" gives us, in between some admittedly spectacular visuals. I know what you're thinking: ""It's not meant to be an Oscar winner."" ""It's a popcorn movie."" ""Why can't you just shut off your brain and have a good time?"" Also: ""You suck."" All of the above are probably true. And yet, I had a hard time connecting with ""Jurassic World"" and its cardboard characters making poor choices over and over again. It simultaneously tries to cram in too much without giving us enough in the way of substance. I was a big fan of director and co-writer Colin Trevorrow's first feature, 2012's ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" an indie, sci-fi dramedy in which the time travel element actually worked. (It also made Mark Duplass surprisingly sexy for the first time.) Trevorrow is doing his best Spielberg impression here, and he creates a couple of thrilling set pieces — his pterodactyl attack, for example, is at once exciting and horrifying and a lovely little Hitchcock homage. But I'm not sure he was ready for a behemoth of a film like this just yet. Let's get to the plot real quickly, and a few thoughts, then call it a day. ""Jurassic World"" made nearly $209 million in its first weekend for the biggest domestic opening of all time. Clearly, you saw it and you know what happens. Nevertheless, let us trudge on. A bunch of people, who didn't learn from the travesties that occurred during the original ""Jurassic Park"" from 1993 and its two sequels, have developed yet another family-friendly dino playland on an island off the coast of Costa Rica under the guidance (and considerable financial support) of billionaire Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan). Among his chief employees is velociraptor wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt), who is ruggedly confident and wears leather vests with zero irony. The one truly astonishing element of ""Jurassic World"" is that it manages to make Pratt boring. He's the hottest and most charismatic star on the planet right now, and he's on a huge roll following last year's ""The Lego Movie"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Here, he certainly rises to the physical challenges but he's strangely understated, stuck as he is in a one-note role. It is an enormous bummer. Pratt is also stuck in a half-baked romantic subplot with Bryce Dallas Howard, who co-stars as Claire, an all-business operations executive. (Her sleek bob says it all.) They had one date, and now he keeps trying to flirt with her. The banter in the script — from Trevorrow, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" writer Derek Connolly and the husband-and-wife team of Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver — isn't exactly the snappiest. And — spoiler! — when Owen and Claire finally do kiss after a sequence of great panic, it feels forced and hollow. But Claire has been too busy for him, or for anything outside of work. Like a clichéd rom-com heroine, she's married to her job (for which her sister, played by Judy Greer, shames her). Claire is also busy on this particular day tending to her visiting nephews, sullen teenager Zach (Nick Robinson) and his perky moppet of a younger brother, Gray (Ty Simpkins). A subplot about the kids' parents divorcing is brought up and then dropped — as if placing them in massive peril repeatedly ostensibly weren't enough to garner our sympathy. Then there's another whole subplot featuring Vincent D'Onofrio as a private military contractor who wants to take Owen's well-trained velociraptors and turn them into a lucrative fighting force. As if the humans-are-so-arrogant theme running through the whole series weren't completely obvious yet, this really hammers it home, and it turns the formidable, versatile D'Onofrio into a swaggering, Texas stereotype. These people and thousands of others find themselves under attack when the park's latest attraction, a five-story-high dino hybrid known as the Indominus Rex, escapes after being raised in isolation for years. (This is incredibly violent for a PG-13 movie, by the way — something to think about if you're pondering bringing young kids.) But the park gets a spike in attendance every time something new is developed, and under the watch of mad scientist Henry Wu (BD Wong), this is the biggest creature yet. It's got more teeth, a brilliant mind and the ability to camouflage itself — all to ""up the 'wow' factor,"" as Claire puts it, with catastrophic consequences. So basically, ""Jurassic World"" is a big-budget indictment of corporate greed, jammed with product placement for Samsung and Mercedes-Benz and Beats by Dre and Coca-Cola. But given the record-shattering opening the movie had, I'd say everyone involved had their cake, ate it too and went back for seconds.",Jurassic World

How do you go wrong? Plot holes and errors, lots of them. You've got so much potential in an anticipated movie, and it still seems rushed, not thought through, and poorly directed (which makes no sense at all given it's literally Steven Spielberg as the producer). The action and effects are very entertaining.

To much like a King Kong or any other big monster in the city movie. Jurassic World has a couple new twists, and what exactly do fans expect when you are making another movie about dinosaurs on an island with people? Jurassic world isn't a yawn fest but it should have had better writing and directing. If Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg had been involved I think it would have been better. Bottom line it is still is better than II. So let's hope there is a V and they put more thought into it.",Jurassic World
547,yarik83,Insult to legacy of the franchise. Mediocre at best,4,19 June 2015,"I can't believe Spielberg would sign off on this movie. I honestly can't. Just for sake of transparency let's go back to year 1993. Computer animation was just taking off, animatronics was about the only viable option and naturally on location shoots and heart and soul that went into creating what we now know as classic. Skip ahead a few years and we got a sequel. On the heels of the original, this one failed to impress with same grandeur but it has done well enough for an honorable mention. And then they tried to fix all of their mistakes in movie #3. If it was not for Sam Neil dragging movie by the scruff, I think it would have been a flop. So we went from 1993, 1997 and 2001. You would have thought that after so many years (22 to be exact), they would have had the decency to produce something more than a mediocre flick. OK so animation was there... tell us something new... these days computer animation and green screen is not only the norm but people are too lazy to travel around the world making some movies entirely in the hangar of Hollywood. It would work for something like an Avatar with its Pocahontas storyline but Cameron spared no expense and crossed all t's and dotted the i's. With prevalence of CGI we were expecting a story line, which never came. Acting was absolutely atrocious and when I say that, I am actually being generous. Control room staff was beyond belief... as if they literally picked them off a starbucks line and said... ""just sit there and say this really stupid line"". Naturally the muscle of the movie with military inclination was completely unbelievable. It was not a typical macho super muscular played by some former US marine... no we got stuck with Vincent D'onforio... as if while scraping bottom of the barrel they found him sitting there with a puppy eye look just begging for a role. I don't know who's back he had to scratch but his contribution to the movie or lack of there of was evident in both his dialogue and character development. And then we have the boys... especially the older one. I honestly got tired of rolling my eyes in the movie theater. Lady Bryce was absolutely and totally out of place. Poor casting choice there. At the very least poor character story line in every single sense of the way.This movie has failed to deliver. It is an insult to the franchise. In this day and age you would expect that movie #4 that was built upon legacy of a cult classic would have given an honest effort. In reality this was barely watchable. Yeah I heard a few chuckles in the audience but those were in regards to little boy saying something funny every now and then. Audience never so much let out a peep. I think Spielberg has lost his focus. Ever since he went into being a mr fancy pants, his movies have been atrocious. Without his directing and without his vision... these directors and producers really behave like three blind mice just running around the box flinging stuff at walls hoping it would stick. Spielberg... you have lost your credibility by signing off on this movie. If you read other reviews, they will go in depth as to why this movie failed to deliver. I honestly can't find the words in me to say anything more... I am so livid.",Jurassic World
548,missmomosa,Jurassic World gets a Yes from me,7,28 July 2015,"No major spoilers here . . .I am a HUGE dinosaur fan, love it, love Jurassic films more than my son so seeing this was super exciting for me and I'm 33 years old.The cons are - storyline could have been stronger with more build up but everything isn't perfect.Another con was - where were the dinosaurs? I wanted to more dinosaurs, more of them every where and I didn't get that so that was disappointing. They spent too much time on the aunt and her relationship with the nephews which to me wasn't strong enough to carry on it's own anyway.Another con - the idea of the park was, well. . . I don't know if I liked it or if I thought it was crazy but this is exactly what the professor wanted in the original ones so it carries on his wants very well.Another con - manufactured dinosaurs? what idiot thinks this will ever be a good idea? seriously? Dinosaurs used a weapons (major side eye this way folks) And one more con - where did all the people go so fast?? Let that sink in. . .oh and no woman can do what she did in heels, that's just not realistic. I would have loved to see her dressed like she worked at a park and not a fancy schmancey club or executive office. And more of Dr. Woo would have been nice to help build onto the story.So with all of those cons I still give this movie a 7/20 because it's fun. It has dinosaurs, a story line, medaling kids, love story, the dramatics, and raptors - who doesn't love raptors? I would love to see where they go with this but they will have some major plot building to do. The main dinosaur should have been presented in far more heinous way than it was - I wanted to be scared by it but I wasn't.If you are a Jurassic fan, I say go see it.

550,OliverGbyrne,A true Sequel to Jurassic Park!,8,13 June 2015,"Watching this very entertaining blockbuster, I kept thinking that this really should have been Jurassic Park 2. I found that the Lost World was overstuffed plot wise and that JP3 lacked any tension and did not have an interesting story to tell.Now Jurassic World brought one of the main points I loved about the original film, it really is about a theme park gone wrong just like the original but in a much larger scale. The plot resolve around teenager Zach and his little brother Gray who are sent to Jurassic World by their parents who are going through a rough patch in their relationship.Here they are supposed to spend time with their Aunt Claire who manage the park but she his too busy overseeing the park newest attraction, a genetically created new type of Dinosaur.This new breed his faster, smarter and deadlier this is why she his getting assistance from Dino expert/Ex boyfriend Owen to evaluate this new creation.Of course this being a Jurassic Park film the Pooh soon enough hit the fan, the kids get lost, the new Dino go on a rampage and well all hell break loose. Acting wise you have the main four actors that are very likable and you do end up caring for them.Chris Prat is bringing the same charisma he delivered in Gardians of Galaxy.Howard his perfect has the stuck up workaholic who gets a severe wake up call and the two kids are not annoying (No gymnastic routine thank goodness) But the Dino is really what people want to see and Dinosaurs are here at plenty.You have returning favorites and I was happy that they gave some flying Dino some time to shine. Well I had a great time and I would advise people to experience this film in Imax 3d for full immersion, you won't regret it. Overall, it is not better then the first film (Considering the first one is a cult classic that has a footprint in film history that would be impossible) but it is much,much better then both the Lost World and the horrid JP3, it feels like a true Sequel with plenty of wink to the original film throughout.I give this Franchise return to form a solid 8 out of 10.",Jurassic World

I like Chris Pratt and he's decent in this, but the script is absolutely atrocious. There's no sense of purpose to anything happening or the filmmaking, other than to remind the audience of other far better movies. There are homages and nods to Spielberg's prior filmography and I picked up a little Hitchcock influence, but this film doesn't pair these allusions or inside jokes with anything marginally original. The CGI is good but with such a poor script, two dimensional characters and no real vision the film just goes nowhere and ends with a laughable conclusion.

So in that sense the movie fails. Apart from that this is a very entertaining movie.This movie was like a resurgence to the whole franchise and it does a pretty decent job in resurrecting the brand name, but then half way into the movie the director loses that grip and moves into a monster movie genre rather than sticking to the plan, which is annoying. The movie has got a lot of negatives, which makes it a mere one-time fun flick action movie The cast: OMG, what a waste, its like each character is dispensable, nobody gives you that involvement and even if they die you would rather not be surprised at all. The actors should make the audiences more involved, which is not happening at all. The brother duo chemistry was horrible, the mom/son relationship was dismal, the lead actors romantic trial made them even more unlikeable. Some of situational comedy are cartoonish, like the hero catching a fly from mid air, seriously?? you might still be giggling about it while somebody is being ripped into pieces. The actors couldn't even cry and sure as hell couldn't make the audience laugh The plot: Create something evil and it will turn evil. seriously, that's it. Why have someone train a raptor? Raptor are clever and evil as they are, the first movie addressed that very clearly and it clearly stated these are monsters will hunt everything, despite this the Hero is training them like pet dogs, no movie no! If only the movie had believed the animals for what they are and constructed some plan to get them out of the mess, i would be more than happy to call it awesome, but it clearly does not understand this and tries to make a Godzilla movie when it should have been aiming for the Predator. Honestly Jurrasic Park was hit because of the thrills: The first appearance of T-rex, the Kitchen Scene, etc. Movie makers please know the genre of movies before making them The only fact this movie is rated high is because people have seen Jurrasic Park 3 and that has made this movie stand tall and look much better.

Simply put, the movie company waited until enough time passed and a new generation is the focus of their marketing. Not only is the storyline a complete copy of the original Jurassic Park, but even with all the developments in technology since the original, they still managed to screw it up and present a mediocre offering. All I can say is that I hope the new generation go to the trouble of viewing the original Jurassic Park, so that they can see what an utter load of rubbish this so called movie actually is. It seems the buck reigns supreme in Hollywood and any attempt to improve on the original just simply does not exist. They want your money, and quality or value is not a concern. By all means watch this rubbish, but please do yourself a favour, and watch the original as well, just so you can see how little interest Hollywood has in your enjoyment.

We went into the normal 2D and expected to enjoy this movie, nothing really more. Having now seen it, I can now confidently say that this movie is the best Jurassic Park sequel and a great time in the theater. I went into this knowing that no sequel will ever match the awe and wonder of the original, so I just expected to see some great Dino mayhem, and this movie delivers extremely well.The story follows some interesting characters working on the Jurassic World resort. In this day of age, people are no longer impressed with regular dinosaurs. Because of this, InGen, the corporation in charge of running the park, called on the laboratory scientists working on the park to make a new hybrid dinosaur to be scarier, bigger, and better than all the other dinosaurs in the park. Enter the Indominus Rex, Jurassic World's answer to the unimpressed customers coming to the resort. However, as expected, not everything goes according to plan. Thus ensues a movie that is as chaotic as the trailers have promised.As for the characters themselves, Chris Pratt confirms once again that he is able to lead an action movie and is sure to see more movies like this in the future. Bryce Dallas Howard is fine as the stern corporation employee who only sees the dinosaurs as ""assets."" The rest of the characters and actors fit well into the story and add more to the tension. (And the body count)Viewing the movie from a technical standpoint, there are various flaws, but none to take away from the enjoyment of the film overall. The script is a little uneven in places and there are a few characters whose arcs could have been explored more.Overall though, Jurassic World excels in its wonderful visuals and tense action scenes. Colin Trevorrow crafted this film amazingly and has shown himself to be an up and coming director to look out for. Lastly, a compliment must be given to Michael Giacchino's wonderful score that manages to recapture the wonder from the first movie and also add to the tone of this sequel. Jurassic World is everything you can ask for from a summer blockbuster bearing the ""Jurassic"" title. ""Monster is a relative term. To a canary, a cat is a monster. We're just used to being the cat.""",Jurassic World
555,neazy,"Dull, dire, disappointing",4,18 August 2017,"This film, mainly because of Chris Pratt, makes just enough of its one- dimensional plot to be watchable, but it is a dreadful mess. The plot formula is long worn out, to the extent that any form of believability is absent. That's not to say that a film about a dinosaur theme park ought to be realistic, but the characters are so moronic, and the key story elements so ludicrous and formulaic, that there is not enough left to tie it to the real world in which it sets its fantasy, and therefore there is no reason to care. This is not helped by wooden stock characters and the utterly predictable relationships between them. This film is a monotone, generic smashy-crashy blockbuster, devoid of charm, nuance, or emotional depth. And to add insult to injury, despite over 20 years of improved technology, the CGI dinosaurs are rendered less realistically than their counterparts from the original Jurassic Park! What a disappointment.",Jurassic World

The basic plot premise is that a giant, genetically-engineered dinosaur goes postal and starts eating everybody. A small band of plucky folks have to save the day. Well, whoopie-doo.What salvages the film is that the dinosaurs are amazingly well-executed, and very frightening. There's a real sense of dread, even though we know that in a movie of this type the heroes ... well that would be a spoiler, I guess, although I'm sure everybody knew how the movie would end after the first ten minutes.All in all, a thoroughly one-dimensional movie -- long on dramatic effects, short on everything else.

It looked like the producers were like 'Hey, there was this movie in 1993, which made a lot of money. The beasties from the sequels and some we invent our own can be put in a movie. But let's just use the same old story, because we can't come up with anything original on our own'.The size of the Mosasur was tremendously exaggerated. Mosasaurs were never this big. And what did the crew think about Triceratops? Let's look at biblical fundamentalist Ken Ham's 'Creation Museum' and saddle back the triceratops? Come on already...We all know that the biggest creatures in nature like whales, elephants, rhino's, etc. have no natural enemies and don't need camouflage skills in order to hunt or survive.

558,larrymeers,A fun popcorn thriller!,7,11 March 2017,"Jurassic world is the 4th installment in the Jurassic Park franchise. It's main plot is a new open park full with man made dinosaurs and one day the company decides to make a genetic hybrid to boost the public's attention. But that of course goes horribly wrong and soon enough the hybrid is on the loose and killing people left and right. While all of this is going on, a raptor trainer Owen and the park's owner Clair must stop this monster before a monster mash goes down. First the good. Chris Pratt plays a good role and he is easily the best human character. The action is very entertaining and very pleasing to the eye. The dinosaurs are very cool as always, and the hybrid was awesome. The suspense is one of the strongest things this movie has to offer. But now time for the bad. There are a few people you do not really care about, for example there are two kids in the movie that were completely hollow and didn't have any real purpose except for escaping the dinosaurs. And sometimes this movie can come off as silly when it tries to be cool. So in the end Jurassic World is a fun, action packed, summer blockbuster that may not be as good as the original but has it memorable moments in the Jurassic Park universe. 7/10 Check it out.",Jurassic World
559,sreethered,Jurassic Park: A Fan-Fiction,6,1 July 2015,"People are criticizing this movie for not being a contender for the Spielberg classic. How can it be, when even Spielberg himself couldn't make a worthwhile sequel? Colin Trevorrow, the director of 'Safety Not Guaranteed' had a Herculean task on his hand when he was slated to direct this sequel-reboot. Setting the criticizing aside, I think the guy had made some admirable effort. Jurassic World is a fairly-entertaining movie that passes as a watchable one.Sure, in no way this film could catch up with the original. The animatronics was replaced with some sloppy CGI, it lacked interesting characters, and the whole script was flawed with bad writing. But, Trevorrow treated it as a disaster movie rather than an innovation, and when we see it that way, the end product is satisfactory. Besides, he tried to bring out the nostalgia we all wanted with occasional nods to the original. From the evergreen soundtrack to the T-Rex, most of this movie proves the directors dedication to the subject. The sequences with the raptors were thrilling in the beginning. It's a shame he couldn't develop it more interestingly.As Jurassic World established itself as a box-office success, there is a certain possibility of having a string of sequels in the future. Whether Trevorrow's dedication can hold up the franchise is a question for the future.",Jurassic World

Anything else is dumb and stereotyped. And it doesn't have the soul of the first one, which remains my favourite, but I think that was because Michael Crichton book was behind the scripts and Spielberg was directing.But if you don't care about the plot, don't get irritated by the dumbness of the characters and you like dinosaurs and actions it delivers. I would give it a 7 if the main female character wasn't so stupid and I can't tolerate anymore dumb women on screen. When Chris Pratt character criticises her attire, and in particular her shoes, as inadequate for a hike in the forest with prowling dinosaurs and she rearranges her shirt in a more casual way I remained dumbstruck: too idiotic for words.",Jurassic World

I think it first fools you into thinking it was going to be a horror flick and kind of disappoints in the lightness it goes into during the perilous scenes. After making a death defying jump you laugh it off and say ""We actually jumped"". The fear factor was so dumbed down to make the movie acceptable for kids that it became almost boring until the twist in the end. I wish it was more dark and menacing instead of light and serial like. Still, it was the sixth highest grossing films and this story worked. My justification for the nonchalant attitude was that these creatures were a part of that world for decades and everyone was used to a beast on the lose once in a while. The special effects are amazing and the sound filled my theater room better than any other film this year. I would buy this movie because like ""Frozen"" this movie will be around for a long time.",Jurassic World
562,cubsckc,Same Plot Like Every Other,3,12 June 2015,"In the end, I wasn't surprised the movie was a disaster, and to tell you what, I heard about the script years ago about genetically modified dinosaurs and Steven trying to make dinosaurs man's friend. So its, not like I was thrown a curved ball of garbage. Movie starts out excellent. Your given a world that you've never seen before. In fact its just as beautiful and new as the old movie. So yes, you are blown back. You see some of the trained dinosaurs. It wasn't totally lame, and it was somewhat unbelievable. We move to the genetically enhanced dinosaur and the roller coaster ride starts immediately. I think it was quite lazy if you ask me. Like they ran out of imagination and just started the movie way to fast. Before that, you do see some similarities to the old movie. You see the same genetic scientist from the first movie who Dr. Grant was talking to about the raptors being made on the island and Malcom was debating about life finding away. You also see that someone else took over that old dude's dream of making a park. Anyhow, you see like in every movie that there is evil people trying to control nature. It worked well in the first film, but it really fell apart after that. You'd think they'd get the point. Spielberg likes to push this idea of people not being able to control nature. But its done so many times before that its pretty dumb now. I can't believe the security on the island decided to battle the dinosaur hybrid with raptors for crying out loud. Its pretty dumb. The genetics guy gets taken off the island before the end by the remaining security and makes it possible for another Jurasic failure. Throughout the movie you are given way to many impossible scenarios so that Spielberg's message can be scene. The two major problems with the film is that one, its the same story plot as every other Jurassic film. Seriously, its kind of boring and lame, and shows lack of imagination. Secondly, the film becomes a confusing type of film. Is it a dinosaur film? Is it a science fiction freak film? The film was violent. But except for the beginning you don't feel that dinosaur aspect. You feel more of a freak/horror film science film feel afterwards. Its not a good film, but like myself, I really needed to see it for myself because I really didn't know what to expect. I think it makes you to curious. But pretty much, your getting exactly what your thinking before you go in to watch it.",Jurassic World

The original was ten times better, Chris Pratt could learn how to act if he watched the original and took notes on how good actors like Sam Neill and Geoff Goldblum perform. Not once in the film did I feel any tension or excitement, in fact I felt like falling asleep it was that boring.

Lots of action and enough of it different from the past movies to have a few surprises, and there was even a plot twist that I will not mention. The human interactions are contrived for the most part. There wouldn't be time to build characters in a movie that demands a rolling start not to lose the audience so people say things that seem out of blue in order to accomplish some establishment, however predictable that makes the outcome. The action sequences are handled competently as well as the CGI effects and ""real"" dinosaur props. There is not a moment where I was pulled out of the reality of the place. Until the end, which brings up the spoiler so skip the rest if you are going to see JW. A woman, in heels, outruns a full grown Tyrannosaur over several hundred yards with virtually no beginning lead. We had pretty well established in earlier movies that a T-Rex could easily outrun a human being.

Jurassic Park was one of those movies. When the first dinosaur was shown my eyes opened as wide as Dr. Grant's and my mouth opened wide in si ple wonerment. Unfortunately, there's none of that wonder in this film. Henry Wu genetically re-engineered for Jurassic World? He was killed by veloceraptors in the first film and he should have stayed dead. And considering how many people were munched in the first film is it possible that human greed can honestly produce such monumentally foolish and ignorant people? Well, according to Hollywood: Yes. Claire and just about everyone associated with the park is obsessed with greed and blinded by tech. It's all rather disgusting and if I may say just plain dumb. The older kid is a twerp , we have a park manager in waaay over her head, an incompetent and poorly armed security staff, personnel completely untrained for emergency, a hapless owner, a head mad scientist, and an implausible mercenary angle that falls off a cliff. The movie is sorta exciting but it's so silly that it's hard to feel sorry for anything but the poor animals. I was honestly rooting for stupid humans to be trampled or eaten, and plenty of them get munched.

568,t-hf,Makes me angry the more I think about it!!!,1,15 June 2015,"So, you're either hearing two things about the recently released Jurassic World by now: that it is a shameful cash grab or that you should just enjoy it for what it is. Well I went into the movie not as a mega-massive-super fan of Jurassic Park, but as a lover of good movies in general. I tried to enjoy it for what it is and I couldn't even enjoy it as that. I can promise you that this movie is a massive waste of time and money for anyone that loves good summer entertainment. I always try to open reviews by stating the positives, but this movie made me so angry, bored and frustrated that I couldn't think of any major positives to mention. I can sum the plot up in maybe one sentence: dinosaur gets out, dinosaur eats people, more dinosaurs get out, they eat people, Star-Lord (or Chris Pratt for you non Marvel geeks) saves the day. Now I know that it weakens the film's impact if you compare it to the first film, but if the film wants to try and wear the series' trademark, i'll treat it as such. Think about the first movie's plot and try to explain it as in depth as you can. Here's my attempt:WARNING!!! SPOILERS FOR JURASSIC PARK!!""Three scientists are invited to an island by a wealthy entrepreneur, where he has built a theme park featuring genetically cloned dinosaurs. At first the park seems to dazzle, but these three scientists have their doubts. After exploring the park briefly - the power is inadvertently shut off, the dinosaurs are out and what started as an assessment of the park's safety has become a thrilling race for survival"".Sounds riveting doesn't it? Well Jurassic World is basically a version of that plot bereft of any suspense, wonder or witty dialogue that the original film contained so much of. Seriously, there is no tangible suspense built up before dinosaurs run amok. The characters are the most predictable clichés', the plot has no clear focus and the CGI dinosaurs somehow look more fake than a movie produced in the early 90's when CGI was still catching up with filmmaker's visions. I could go on all day but i'll just tell you some things that bugged me. For one, I am sick of seeing women represented as either useless love interests or uptight control freaks, and this is coming from a dude in his early 20's ( part of the main demographic for this film). Granted, the main female character did do a few important things, but she still starts out as a sad, time obsessed freak governed by her tight schedule that needs to be saved from her lonely existence by the equally clichéd, free spirited, fun and worldly bloke (but at least he was played by Chris Pratt which is an added plus). Why can't we see the roles reversed or have more strong female characters? Why can't women be represented with more likability in movies? Another thing that bugged me was how the film had an overarching sense of action and danger, but interspersed it with moments of ""ohhh, ahhh"" and ""look, aren't dinosaurs magical?"", whereas the first movie had a sense of the latter dominating the first half, but as soon as the dinosaurs break out, the atmosphere turns deadly and the transition between these two styles is handled sublimely well. I think we'll have to accept that people just don't make movies like Jurassic Park or Close Encounters or Star Wars anymore (to name a few). Films with real magic and just enough imperfection and slight flaws to make us care. This film to me was the representation of the worst in CGI filled summer blockbusters. Films that are so tightly made and perfectly cut without any moments drawn out for suspense or awe, that we just don't care about anything that happens.I apologise for the angriness of this review, but this film has made me more angry the more I think about it. If anything, it just made me want to go back and watch the first movie again, which I did to wash the taste away that night. For a movie that is trying to kick start the franchise again, that is a very bad sign. I just have no faith in Hollywood anymore. 2014 was such a good year for movies, why can't this year be as good. Very few directors are working today with as much passion and integrity as Spielberg. The only name that really comes to mind is Christopher Nolan. Anyway, I suppose I would say go see it if you love action and monster movies, but if you love suspense, wit and a brilliantly paced story (all the good stuff), I wouldn't recommend it.",Jurassic World

571,n-middleton-117,Absolutely Awful!,3,15 June 2015,"From the moment I saw the trailer, I felt as though this movie was going to either be brilliant, and revitalise the series, or it would be horrendous. Sadly it was most certainly the latter of the two.It has done what it set out to do though, and that was to make use of a hugely popular name to make as much money off it as possible. It does so at the cost of good sense and taste though.There are too many tangential and irrelevant plot lines, that serve in no manner to further the main story. - The characters are hardly likable, and instead are a mash of cliché characteristics, which are put together so poorly that you're unable to form any kind of connection with them; and in my case, I found myself wanting many of the main characters to get eaten by the dinosaurs because of how frustratingly annoying they are. - The movie is half comprised of just a mash of scenes from the previous 3 movies. It's more like a game of guess which movie this scene is from, rather than watching anything remotely creative. - The main plot, besides being logically flawed, also never really builds to a climax. Rather it has many little moments which are supposed to create suspense or to be a twist, but fail to deliver any kind of real impact, mainly because they never developed the story or characters before jumping into the money making action scenes. - And lastly, the dinosaurs. Oh! My! God! Where do I begin? For starters, their portrayal of a lot of these dinosaurs is deplorable, not only because of unrealistic they are in design, but also in nature. There weren't any Pterodactyl species that would go hunting for human sized prey, and there certainly weren't any that had heads twice the size of their body. But perhaps even more annoyingly than that, they scripted the dinosaurs to behave almost as though they were characters in a kids show.The only saving graces of this movie, were the special effects, and the soundtrack...and let's face it, neither of those are really original. The soundtracks we love have been used throughout the franchise all along, and the special effects, whilst quite grand, are no better than they were 22 years ago for the first movie. In my opinion, I think the first movie's special effects were actually better, because they relied less heavily on CGI. It's impressive to see a whole world created digitally, but no matter how good the renderings are, it'll never be as good as real life sequences.As a whole, this movie was a monumental disappointment, although not really a surprise. It is however even more infuriating though, because the Jurassic Park series is one I have loved since I was a child, and now I'm seeing it get butchered as they chase those lucrative pay cheques. The fact they're reportedly going to be making a sequel to this is even more disheartening too; rubbing salt into the wound.It gets a measly 3/10 from me.",Jurassic World
572,RemusGrey,Jurassic World is a perfect return to Isla Nublar,8,7 August 2015,"We want a better Jurassic Park sequel. Jurassic World is a ""better sequel"". It doesn't have a story based on the book and it does feel like a remake using the same timeline, yet it is perfect return to Isla Nublar. Remember when the first Jurassic Park movie came out in 1993? The movie was a preview tour of the park. The whole park was destroyed and the T-Rex was the only dinosaur to survive the hurricane on Isla Nublar. John Hammond envisioned a fully functioned theme park on Isla Nublar. While we are at Isla Sorna (The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3), the park was probably being fixed and improved. John Hammond has passed away later on, and what he envisioned (a fully functioning dinosaur theme park) came true. 14 years later after Jurassic Park 3 (2001-2015) the movie brings us back to Isla Nublar's dino park and it is complete! It is wonderful! What John Hammond had dreamt of on the park has come true! It feels ""realistic"". Let's compare the park of Isla Nublar to a building being under construction for many years. That building was planned to be opened that year after a preview tour, but was wrecked with an earthquake. And you can never go there again. A few decades later, that building has opened again and this time has been improved and is exactly how the creator of this building dreamt of. As you were a kid, the building was ordinary, but now it has improved and is exactly how the maker wanted it be as you are now an adult. The same thing goes to Jurassic Park becoming Jurassic World. And it's a perfect return to Isla Nublar. However, the film feels like a remake to the first one. Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) feels like Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and Alan Grant (Sam Neill) again. The two kids played by Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins are just like the two kids in the first Jurassic Park movie. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is another main female character who feels like another main female character in the first movie. The characters felt like they were remade, yet we have a very different story. The story is pretty interesting. The plot, however, makes it a bit too long to be a perfect movie. We first meet two baby I-Rex's, we meet the two kids, we return to Isla Nublar, we meet a girl, we meet a raptor trainer, the I-Rex escapes, and the story goes on. It's kind of hard to understand the story. The story is about saving Claire's children from the dangerous I-Rex. We will focus on new things, then the old, then we return to the new ones, we come back to the old, and it goes on. It's not that important, but I can say that it's likable. Returning to the old things is the most memorable parts of the movie. It's not to say there is nothing else memorable. The dinosaurs are also memorable. Those raptor chase scenes, dinosaur attractions, and of course, the final dinosaur fight. Those are not really seen in the first Jurassic Park movie, but the movie still cannot be better than the first one.There are some weak dialogue in the film. It's a tiny letdown, but you would appreciate the directing and acting. Colin Trevorrow who directed the film directs just like Steven Spielberg and he does a great job in bringing a classic back to life. Michael Giacchino's score is very good and in two scenes, the score made me wish to cry as my childhood returns. He is just like John Williams right now. Chris Pratt does very well in his acting. His voice may be annoying sometimes, but he is a talented actor who follows the tone of the scene. Bryce Dallas Howard plays an annoying character. She is indeed annoying in her role because of her character. I bet she follows how her character is developed.Verdict: Jurassic World's story is pretty hard to understand. The plot is OK, but it makes the length of the movie longer, which is good. Again, even though the story is hard to understand, this is a perfect return to both the classic film and Isla Nublar. The ending, to me, is my favorite scene in the whole movie. Remember the T-Rex from the first Jurassic Park? We meet her again. We can see her wounds from the previous raptor fight in the first Jurassic Park. She is old, but still strong. Her roar at the end may have meant that she has won the T-Rex vs I-Rex fight. She won. She saves the day again! Her roar makes me want to cry because it brings back my memories from the first Jurassic Park movie. The soundtrack in that scene also make me want to cry. The ending is perfect. The movie should never beat the first Jurassic Park movie, but the whole crew of the movie did an unbelievably great job in bringing back our Jurassic Park memories. Let's hope that The Force Awakens does that too and Star Wars 8 does a perfect Lando return. Jurassic World is the best ""classic welcome back"" movie and one of the best movies of 2015. The filmmakers just doesn't do their job, they had a good idea behind all these, and it ended up perfect. No, not the movie, it's the ideas.8/10",Jurassic World
573,IanAJohnson,"This film was thrilling and enjoyable, but couldn't let go of the past.",7,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise and deals with what would happen if the dinosaur theme park eventually opened. I am a huge fan of the first two Jurassic Park movies (the third one was only okay) and their narratives on the relationship between man and nature so I was excited to see what this movie could add to that. There is a new narrative that I think actually adds quite a bit to the lore of Jurassic Park. The writing was quite good. There are quite a few scenes that focus on the creation of the dinosaurs in the park and humanities illusion of control over them. Unfortunately there are also a lot of small details that ignore major concepts from the first two movies, especially in the theme park ride designs. Not a single one of the rides shown in this film would last a day in the first two films, and some of the designs wouldn't even work in real life (like giving the customers control over the safari vehicles that allow them to move into the animals' territories instead of an automated path or tour guide). There are also many small plot points that were taken straight from the first film. Despite this, once everything begins to fall apart and the focus falls from the attractions, the film really picks up and keeps going till the end. This film is more of a disaster flick than a survival flick, but it manages to feel like a survival movie for most of the core scenes. Most of the characters are well done. They are simple, yet relatable. The only problem I have here is the two brothers. They had a small story arch that was way deeper than it needed to be and in the end went nowhere and did not resolve itself. The special effects were fantastic and while there were times where it was obvious that C.G.I. was involved, there were more times when I couldn't tell if I was watching an animatronic dinosaur or a C.G.I one. There were many great tense moments that really dragged me in and kept me there. If you were a fan of the first couple of films, you will probably enjoy this one. It isn't as good as the first two, but still excellent.",Jurassic World

I have managed to skip Jurassic mania as I sensed it was a bunch of hype but upon seeing trailer for JW2 I became interested (as Chris Pratt as Starlord is amusing as hell). Then I put the DVR on and sat back to find out what all the excitement was about as it must be good to make a sequel to a sequel and theme parks and such. I was mistaken, and I wasn't entirely sure when the feeling hit me that this is a steaming pile of raptor remains, but it was pretty close to when the bigger clueless guard gets munched in one bite, our ""heroes"" escape the plastic orb of doom or Lena Luthor (didn't catch name or her importance in the movie , kind of like the owner who had copter flying issues) being tossed about by pterodactyls (like they wouldn't just fly away) like a frisbee while our ""heroes"" stand around trying to figure out what to do next, or making out for no apparent reason. Stopped there, may not return as I figured military dude will get in a showdown trying to stop Rex and all his men will get their ass kicked till Chris Pine and high heeled partner w kids she doesn't know the heights of fashion a grenade launcher out of spare jeep parts from 20 years ago and save the day. Can't even believe anyone could mention Jurassic anything in the same sentence as The Incredibles I or II as there is no comparison. The ending credits for Incredibles is more entertaining than this POC and if we can somehow dissuade just one person from carrying on the fantasy that this franchise is worthy of anyones time or $$ then this will be worthwhile.",Jurassic World
575,YbsuhA,A new entertaining movie in the franchise.,8,26 February 2021,"Wow. I did not see another sequel coming. Or is it a sequel? Yes, it is.The original ""Jurassic Park"" from 1993 is a classic and the best dinosaur movie ever made. Then it got two sequels, one starring supporting actor Jeff Goldblum, and one starring lead actor Sam Neill for the second time. The sequels are pretty underrated, and they just stopped making more. Until 2015, a giant blockbuster I bet you didn't see coming. Yeah, what was once a park, is now a world. Jurassic World!This was a great way to start a new trilogy. This is is half a sequel, and half a reboot. It starts a new series while continuing another. And it works pretty well. Now we're able to see the diosaurs eat people in modern fashion.This is what a dinosaur movie should be. It doesn't surpass the original in any way, but does the most of the stuff perfectly well. There is for example a scene where Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson jump down a waterfall when they're escaping from a dinosaur. And I spend a lot of time thinking if I would do the same thing? I hate heights, but I'm not a big fan of being eaten alive by a dinosaur either. So I would certainly jump.Now, let's talk about the casting. I love the cast of this movie. In lead roles, you've got that guy from Parks And Rec and GotG, and that lady from Spider-Man 3 and Rocketman. In smaller roles, you've got Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3) and Nick Robinson (Love, Simon) as the nephews of Bryce Dallas Howard. They're lovely in this movie. You've also got that guy from The Office and that girl from 13 Going On 30 as their parents. Fun fact: How likely is it that Judy Greer played the same role as a family mom who's worried for her family in Ant-Man (which also came out the same year). I even had forgot that actors like Jake Johnson, Vincent D'Onofrio and Lauren Lapkus was in this movie. I recently rewatched this movie, after 5 years.But everything in this movie is a blast and fun to watch. The only thing I don't like in this movie, is the final battle between two major dinosaurs (don't remember any dinosaur's name). It feels a little bit boring, but not, like, ""boring"" as the final battle in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (which, btw, was not boring), but boring like the whole Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. It literally has one hour total destruction with two monsters fighting each other, and guess what?? I slept through the whole thing. But in Jurassic World, it only lasts for like fifteen minutes.But besides for that, this is a very fun movie to watch, and I liked it a lot. Not as good as the first one, but good enough to entertain (cause that's the whole purpose).",Jurassic World
576,hamass-mujadid,Memory Loss: I Don't Even Remember the Soundness of Prequels Anymore,4,12 June 2015,"It comes as surprising that with rigorous developments in everything related to entertainment industry, the industry itself has managed to thrust itself into poopholes—they've become lame, lethargic, greedy, and stupid. They've stuck to visuals as the only assets to financial boom. When did they start working for the IRS? If readers don't agree, they ought to follow the Jurassic Park franchise in the right order. The first piece—true Spielbergian—reflected Michael Crichton, or maybe it just didn't have Thomas Tull (f**k you!) as a producer. The second wasn't critically acclaimed, but audiences loved it, so did I. I liked even the third one; there was this kind of momentum to it—the vigor that connected the trilogy, gave it smoothness. And that was 1.5 decades ago. I guess the Jurassic aura became ""the lost world"" in this gap. Because as far as Jurassic World is concerned, it's a clichéd work similar to Gareth Edwards' twice-its-original-size dinosaur (body-building Godzilla,) and struggles to build up thrill and suspense till the very last moment but severely fails to do so.It expects audiences to have patience for the first two hours, enjoy the Disneyland of infant and herbivore dinosaurs, eat popcorn, run out of popcorn, and leave before the T-Rex comes to save the day. Even in that, a comedy of errors takes place, and T-Rex himself is saved only by the incidental intervention of Mososaur, who happens to victimize Indominus, not T-Rex, mind you! So what actually saves the day is not Owen (Chris Pratt,) not at all Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard,) not the trying-to-be-swagger Masrani (Irrfan Khan,) and not even turned-doggy velociraptors, it happened to be the shark-eating, and fortunately dino-eating water-dinosaur who knew the movie's about to end, and so he has to play a part. Yep, that's the spoiler, and that's the end. When everything dies and goes away, the freed T-Rex is not the thing to worry about—and this actually mocks the other movies (Jurassic 1 and 2 kinda bred on T-Rex no?) Back then, they had to get rid of T-Rex (and in JP-2, T-Rexes, actually,) but here it had to be Indominus. And T-Rex was kind enough to go back like a half-tamed cat without accelerating forward to cause some further chaos. Bloody lunatics, all of them. And If Steven Spielberg is the executive producer, like they said in the credits, he should probably apologize already. Loopholes don't end here. The hybrid Indominus, as revealed later on, is half-Rex and half-Raptor. There's that. Okay. And he still seems to camouflage (okay, even that was explained in a lame, unbelievable way) and knows that the park has thermal speculation everywhere, so knows how to dodge that (simply amazing, no? After all, a dino has a better sense than humans, or at least Trevorrow and Tull.) The one thing that touched the heart was John William's Jurassic Park theme, redefined in its own way by Michael Giacchino (Carl goes up, he sure does.) It's warming, and very sentimental, mostly because of its nostalgic characteristic. I wouldn't say that the soundtrack suited perfectly with the movie—where everything's modernized (I'm talking about the park and everything,) it doesn't really makes any sense to keep retaining the old version. I know it was altered, but that too was out of cohesion. I struggled to mold my emotions to the Stone Age, but just couldn't. And every once in a while, I'd try to remember Hammond's stare at his mosquito-stick, and ride back in the helicopter to get my love for Jurassic back, but nothing worked. As said earlier, it was Thomas Tull,(excellent producer for sci-fi(s), worst for dinos) to a great extent. The guy spoiled my memories of Godzilla, and has successfully spoiled my memories of this one. Jurassic World brings all dinosaurs back to life, but fails to make them lovable, for both children, parents, and fellow dinosaurs. Late in the day, came Patt's German Shepherds, but as it turned out, they weren't so loyal. But eventually when it came to his life, they were. How did that happen? From what was shown in the movie, and from I interpreted, and I know my interpretation doesn't suck, I'd say the movie sucks enormously. Gareth Edwards, oopsi, Colin Trevorrow, is trying to tell us that animal instinct flushes away in the blink of an eye? And rather than running for their own lives, the Raptors preferred risking everything to save the lead? C'mon, guys!I understand that I must not expect a lot from and action/adventure/thriller in terms of utter genius, but this wasn't genius, leave alone ""utter."" This was a crappy attempt at regaining potential Jurassic audiences to make some money. Somewhere deep, and I'll sound retarded here, I feel these Sci-fi geeks are over-obsessed with genetic modifications that's why every other movie talks about ""genetic codes"" and blah blah blah. Have a go at ordinariness; it's miles better, I'm telling you. Now, in the very last, I'll discuss the cast. The soon-to-be Temple Runner (Indiana Jones,) and obviously Steven Spielberg's favorite Chris Pratt, plays equal-to-nothing role quite marvelously. By marvelously, I mean he did what was expected, and that's about it. I loved Bryce's Claire. Her personality, unawareness of nephews' age, and don't-exactly-know-when-I-last-saw-you ambivalence, coupled with baffling stripping to get ready for some action, which almost gave a pretty arousing feeling, was beyond lovely. Her hairstyle, clothing, and cocky-but-mocky attitude made it all possible. And then there was her assistant (Katie McGrath of Labyrinth,) who cocked me up despite having a minor performance. As for others, there's nothing substantial to talk about, except to say that they carried JW to its end, without further lagging it down.JW evidences, much like Transformers: Age of Extinction, and The Hobbit trilogy, that gaps and deviances are costlier. Audiences go back with stains on their nostalgia, and critics get something to write about, in detail, and that sucks. Seriously!",Jurassic World

And also Irfan khan , some part of his role is entertaining.The park was introduced in a very modern way.There r some areas off course that need to be improved..But overall its a good movie.I'm selective about the films.But I have to say it was fun ride .. 7 out of 10.",Jurassic World
578,snarkyphilo,"Jurassic World, Needs improvement.",4,13 September 2015,"This quite simply is a generic, not even trying to be original, sci-fi film about Jurassic Park being actually finished and a part of the regular entertainments available in a world some 20 years after the events of the first movie and things expectedly go wrong when scientists, trying to create a better attraction, work shenanigans with dinosaur DNA to create a mcguffin that, also expectedly, gets loose.There are a few snicker worthy scenes, and a few pokes at some clichés, but it feels more like they are trying to distract from the one-dimensional characters and eyeball rollingly bland story.The Special effects weremeh, with a side of irksome. Nothing overly spectacular with the hybrid boss dino, the big visual catch to draw audiences in (both to the park in the movie and the movie's seats) which considering what they say it is made from (t-rex, raptor, cuttlefish(!), and some sort of chameleon) could have at least been a bit more imaginative in looks then what they provided in this monstrosity lacking albino t-rex in need of a manicure with better reach and something that looks like tumours growing out of its back. You don't really see much of the the other dinosaurs in this film (despite the fact the freakin' movie is supposed to be about a park of dinosaurs) with the holograms more believable then the actual flesh and blood were supposed to be.There were only two really noteworthy scenes in the entire movie: the flying dinosaurs terrorizing the park goers, carrying them off and dropping them, particularly the fish-eats-fish-gets-eaten-by-bigger-fish moment with the British assistant (yes that is primarily how the film defines this unvested red shirt in heels), and the boss battle between four of the deadliest dinosaurs was admittedly awesome to see, and a good climax for the action. It's also good that they kept some of the original score from the first film, and didn't fall into the popular song trap that seems to be a recurring trope with films nowadays, so it has that going for it, but it's not enough to save it from the bargain bin at Walmart in the next few years.What really slaps my melon is that they could have used the two hours that this film was running to flesh out the plot, which meanders like a bored child waiting for the show to start at the circus, which doesn't really happen until roughly the (late) latter half of the film. They also used that forced romance element that Hollywood seems to think is mandatory in many films recently (Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy being a few of those prime examples from this year) between two characters that don't have any believable chemistry and a story that didn't even need it, with said pairing only sniping at each other occasionally, an awkward bit of flirting, and a kiss scene that was uncomfortable to watch (and be a part of, judging by the expression on the red head).If you watch this, you will either be mildly amused at best or (most likely) bored and disappointed at worst.",Jurassic World
579,Amonute-Matoaka,"Do yourselves a favour, watch something else this quarantine season.",1,4 February 2021,"Yes, I'm late to this party. I didn't see this film when it premiered back in 2015. There was a ton of negative buzz online at the time and -thankfully, for me- I took note and avoided it at the theatres. Thank God, because I might have been sick right there during the screening. However, we are going through some trying times and the lockdowns wore me down enough that I ended up watching this.First of all, lets look at our protagonists: Both ""heroes"" are horrible human beings.The male character is a ""dinosaur whisper"". A quality that goes against everything Jurassic Park has taught us these past 20something years. Would I be willing to bend the rules if it was worth my time? Maybe, but the way this developed in the film wasn't ground-breaking enough for me to justify a human and his pet (partner?) raptor fist bumping like a kid and his dog in a TV movie.The female character is a cold blooded capitalist who looked at the loose beasts, and then looked at the thousands of visitors and then thought ""oh no, my profits!"". Maybe if I wasn't watching this from a 3rd lockdown that was the direct result of a government leadership incapable of controlling a pandemic, due to its initial choice to prioritise profit over human lives, I'd be more inclined to give this lady a shot at redemption? Perhaps. Let's assume I did choose to allow her to become a better person in this film. She doesn't! She doesn't learn her lesson!Her and the dinosaur dude are -literally- the reason why all these people lost their lives, and yet I'm expected to sit there and accept the film as ending happily for those 2 monsters!On a side note, there are 2 children in this film. They are annoying.Finally, lets talk about the violence. I saw the first Jurassic Park as a kid, and while it was a fairly violent film, I wasn't exactly ""scared"" by it. It was an adventure, with some goriest mishaps than one would expect, like the Brendan Fraser ""The Mummy"" franchise.Now as an adult, I'm horrified to admit that Jurassic World made me sick. Specifically, the violent death of the female assistant (Zara, the only character name I remember. Scratch that, the only character name worth remembering) is one that completely horrified me. It went on forever. It was excessive and needlessly brutal. The woman's screams have been imprinted onto my brain. I had to take a break after it, and I can't believe it happened in the middle of the film.Was I expected to watch a character be brutalised like that on screen and then sit around to watch the rest of the characters joke and get a happy ever after?Zara was a young woman who -as far as we knew- was engaged to be married, and worked as an assistant to the main female character. She was charged with looking after a couple of extremely irritating children along with the rest of her duties and -again, as far as we know- the only thing ""wrong"" about her, is that she lost said children in the crowd at some point. In our eyes as viewers, Zara didn't deserve such a graphic death. As viewers, we're not going to move forward from that easily. At least I didn't, the rest of the film flew past my eyes and I was left with an upset stomach and a brain with only half of its cells intact.Not only is this film a complete waste of time, it might traumatise you. Do yourselves a favour, watch something else this quarantine season.",Jurassic World

Wow, technology just keeps getting better and better.I don't get why all the bad reviews about it being predictable. Like what another reviewer was saying, if you're going to see a Jurassic movie, what were you expecting to happen, that they would just clean themselves in a cage? Yah, that would be totally unpredictable.I also thought the acting for this type of movie was very good, especially from the little boy. Also loved Chris Pratt in this, he was enjoyable to watch. I'm not going to read too much into a dinosaur movie, went to see it for the adventure, loved it and my kids did too. It filled the gap that Godzilla didn't, especially at the end.

Jurassic Park used CGI as a tool to help immersion, and it used it sparingly and carefully, in combination with real props and puppetry, to give it a sense of presence, and make it harder to distinguish what is real and what is not.Jurassic World is made for dumb-dums. Every character is a dumb-dumb who says and does dumb-dumb things. The so-called villain in this film is an idiot whose idiotic plans would never work in modern world.In the original, the bad guy was in it for profit. He was bought. It was realistic. In this one... he's just a complete imbecile.Same goes for everyone except Chris Pratt, who somehow manages to hold his character together despite the plot, dialogue and effects falling apart around him.This is why I gave this film 4 stars instead of 2.",Jurassic World
582,AStormOfSwords13,Thrlling and left me at the edge of my seat,10,11 June 2015,"22 years ago, Steven Spielberg brought Jurassic Park from the paper to the big screen. 2 sequels then came out in 8 years, exceeding the books, which only went on for 2 stories. But after 2001, the movies disappeared, leaving me left to wonder: was Jurassic Park III really the end of an era? Ever since I was a child, watching these movies made dinosaurs one of my biggest fears. When I found that this movie was announced, I knew 2 things. One, Jurassic Park would live on, even as children who have watched this became adults. And two, which was the more important thing, if I was going to watch this movie, I would have to get to work and face my fears.Right from the get-go, the movie does not hesitate to get itself right to the action and location as we see 2 of Claire's (Bryce Dallas Howard) nephews come to Isla Nublar, where Jurassic World has become a full-fledged theme park. Being that Isla Nublar is the location of the first movie, this movie also is not afraid to remember where it all came from. You can only guess that being a Jurassic Park movie, shït will go down for the worse at some point.Meet the Indominus Rex, a hybrid created to attract visitors. That it would be in parent's nightmares is about how I would put it. When the Indominus Rex wreaks havoc, it is a really scary sight to watch. This is a great thing because it means that it accomplished its purpose: to be terrifying. But not only that, the intelligence of the Indominus is a really astonishing aspect that makes this terrible creature a unique and worthy villain.Then you have Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), an expert at understanding animals. This makes him able to communicate with velociraptors. It also makes him into a hardened protagonist, and a very likable one at that, with his no- nonsense attitude, a brave demeanor, a calm, smart mind, alongside an easygoing personality that makes him outgoing and willing to work with anything and anyone willing to work with him.Special effects were spectacular, from the night skies to the dinosaurs. Attention to detail is well-done with the dinosaurs, which one could see just by going to a Dairy Queen while the Jurassic Smash Blizzard is still available and looking at the scales of the Indominus Rex when deciding what you want from the menu.Meanwhile, the plot does what it sets out to do: be an edge of your seat thrill ride, and believe me, I WAS on the edge of my seat with this film. I'll even go as far as to say that this may just be one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time. Like said, the Indominus was terrifying, there were gruesome deaths. However, what I also love is that it doesn't just make itself terrifying, but you get to see how dinosaurs talk to each other and even get to feel for some of the dinosaurs, from the gentle giant apatosaurus to the trained raptors to even the T- Rex!It is not for the faint of heart. But it is well worth the price of an admission ticket and does not disappoint at all. If you feel you can sit through without cowering in fear, then this is a must see.",Jurassic World
583,apstylianou,Another great great summer blockbuster that's pure popcorn enjoyment,9,21 July 2015,"I finally got a chance to see Jurassic World and I feel like the last man on Earth to watch this movie. This movie had a few plot conveniences that come whenever the director decides they should be added in and the side characters were quite underdeveloped and I take down a star for that alone. Nevertheless, this movie had everything I wanted in a action summer blockbuster movie, tension, excitement, laughter and enjoyment, and I loved it.Chris Pratt stole the show, to me, he was one of my favourite performances of the year, Bryce Dallas Howard was great too. She was a fantastic female lead in a movie. We've had so many female leads in movies this year. We've had Emilia Clarke in Terminator: Genisys, Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road, Elizabeth Olsen and Scarlett Johanson in Avengers: Age of Ultron and so many more.The side characters were a great support in the film. The Indominus Rex is by far one of the most scariest antagonists ever in movie history. What makes the Indominus Rex so scary is that you can't predict it's every move and its a highly intelligent animal that breaks free of human control and decides to kill everything in sight that it sees. Seems a bit familiar with Ultron, don't you think? No strings attached to the I- Rex either, it seems.I will say, not every movie is without a flaw, and so here are some things in the movie that made me give it a bit of a thumbs down (and I don't like being a negative nazi, but I can't help but point it out at times.I thought that the side characters, I'm talking about the two boys, Gray and his older brother, Zach. I mean, they are good supporting characters but I kinda forgot about them halfway through the movie, and they were a big part of the film and it's story, but I felt like they were very underdeveloped and not once did I fear for their lives because of that. I mean, I wanted to, but I just didn't.I also felt like there were a few plot twists in the movie that were too convenient for me to be surprised by.SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW SO BE AWARELike for instance, the Indominus Rex is suddenly half-raptor.Dinos can suddenly communicate to each other.The lab is cooking up other dinosaurs that are highly intelligent.Hoskins decides to become the bad guy for no apparent reason and he too was so underdeveloped.Even these plot twists arrive without any proper development. Its like a deus ex-machina that comes out of nowhere at the last second and there's no set-up to any of it. It just comes when the director declares it should come.Still, despite all that, I loved this movie, it was a great cinema experience for me, I had a really great time with it. I'm pretty sure I was the only one in that screen that wasn't with anyone sitting next to me. I felt lonely :(Still, I would definitely recommend this film if you like dinosaurs, exhilarating action, amazing visuals, brilliant acting, Chris Pratt and his awesome raptor friends and stunning cinematography, then this will be your ticket. And for that alone, I'm giving this film a rightfully- deserved 9/10.",Jurassic World

589,cinefreakdude,Depressingly Bad,4,14 June 2015,"There's a scene in Jurassic World where Bryce Dallas Howard's character discusses why it's necessary for the titular theme park to create bigger, better, new dinosaurs to keep customers interested, as the public has by now gotten bored with ""just"" the regular dinosaurs. Ironically, this is a perfect metaphor for the franchise itself – it takes more than just a CGI T-Rex to get a ""wow"" out of audiences now-a- days, and this fourth Jurassic installment seems to acknowledge this, even though it fails to do anything spectacular or different enough to recapture even a sliver of the original's awe factor.Jurassic Park may have been my first cinematic love, so it was only natural for me to be excited about Jurassic World when it was announced. Although skeptical about certain aspects of the film's production, I held out hope that it would be made with care enough to at least elevate it above the previous two sequels. Unfortunately, this is the first major disappointment of the summer; it's little more than a dumb, run-of-the-mill schlock machine, and has more in common with a SyFy Channel Original than a Spielbergian blockbuster.I knew from merely the first ten minutes that this was going to be a downhill ride. Incessant product placement, rushed storytelling and bad acting abounding, Jurassic World's utterly forgettable characters and cringe worthy script only remind us what a masterclass in narrative structure and suspense building the original film was. And yes, even this latest installment's visual effects fail to impress – the CGI is average and it really doesn't help that all this has simply been done before, much better.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both good actors, but the material they're given to work with is abysmal. The character models are cliché and sexist, and the romance feels no less than revoltingly shoe-horned in. After the brilliant Mad Max: Fury Road so refreshingly raised the bar and upset the balance concerning what is expected from a big budget action flick, the many sins of Jurassic World seem all the more lazy and unforgivable. Oh, and the cinematography, lighting and editing give the film the look of a commercial for the entire runtime, which it basically is anyway due to the shameless, nonstop product placement.Marginally better than Jurassic Park 3, but not even deserving association with Spielberg's original masterpiece, Jurassic World's finale of battling 'Rexes is the sole moment in the film in which I felt even remotely on-board. And even this battle is in many ways an inferior reenactment of the climax of last year's Godzilla, which was a far more successful attempt at a Spielbergian monster movie. Jurassic World is depressingly bad; I can't really recommend it on any basis.",Jurassic World

Review by Dr Deena Padayachee. WARNING: There are so many shocking scenes and heart-stopping moments in this film, that perhaps those who have Angina and ischaemic heart disease and are potential heart attack victims should skip this film. It will definitely precipitate tachycardia! As usual, I have not detailed the plot of the film as this would spoil the movie for you. One might as well get the best experience possible with a film like this one, so I took along my old 3D glasses. The lady at the entrance of the cinema told me that I needed IMAX 3D glasses. She was right. The women selling the glasses did not seem to understand me and sold me glasses costing R 8. I saw that there were three sets of glasses and explained to them which film I was going to see; then they sold me the correct set of glasses which cost R10. They made all the difference. The film is utterly graphic and larger than life. Anybody who has visited Disney world will empathise with the way in which the film rolls out, but be prepared to be terrified, absolutely terrified! This is like watching a runaway, alcoholic, Askari, irresponsible, scurrilous, mayhem-creating, rumour mongering/'prejudiced/ biased/ racist, prostitute, propaganda- 007 'academic'/ 'journalist'/ 'lawyer' in action.

When Umhlali Saw Mills and all their workers were in such monsters' sights, there was little that could be done to save the old firm (established 1942 burned down by arsonists in 1996) which had done so much good for our country, created so much employment for largely self taught artisans and built so many schools and homes without so much as having a municipal water supply or anything more than Earth roads. We were destroyed by the privileged part of the Ballito municipality in a macabre replay of that which the 'free West' did to poor countries across our planet from Vietnam to India to Burma to the Congo. It was horrific. This was like watching a greedy, devilish, family- destroying adulterous spouse and her demonic, lesbian lawyer on the money- grabbing trail, hunting for everything that they could steal and dismember. The results are horrendous. One just had to see the children weeping. The owner of the theme park is an Indian who has to recoup his gigantic investment. The conscienceless scientist who had created death and terror in Oppenheimer style (Remember the A Bomb) is Chinese. This came across to me as an anti Asian depiction. This sort of thing was quite common right through out the era of western cultural dominance, (remember the 'Indians' who were shot down by the hundred by murderous cowboys whose guns never ran out of bullets?) through the Ian Fleming 007 era and beyond. Nowadays shameless, brainwashed journalists continue the crude propaganda of the 'free West' and actually are fans of James Bond! The Indiana Jones character who fought off human eating dinosaurs is a tough American (of course) who did not appear to have invaded Vietnam lately. The overwhelmed, preoccupied theme park executive is drop-dead gorgeous. The film plays out through the lens of two youngsters whose parents are in the process of getting divorced. The older lad said something that really struck a chord. Lange style, he said, ""All my friends' parents are divorced; what's new?"" At one point a genetically manufactured, devious (in Apartheid spy-style) beast (who engineers his own release) frees a whole swarm of flying predators who swoop down on hapless humans. That was a horrific sight. They reminded me of Luftwaffe Stukas as they pounced on people, picked them up and tore them to bits. By the way, the film is replete with Mercedes vehicles. I do not think that that was an accident. I was very impressed by just how REAL the dinosaurs and other fierce shark-like creatures looked. In a larger sense, the film dramatised for me just how helpless and hapless most people are when they are picked on by the ogres of the state or large corporations. We all know bureaucrats, even health officials or call centre agents who won't do their job or will target on you. (The one predator reminded me of a technician called Mervin, the other reminded me of a Dubious Pit-her journalist scoundrel; a beast made me think of a Portia it has been my misfortune to encounter.) Think of the chaps who loot the state and then use thugs to torment those who call them to account. Our world seems to be about the GIANTS who violate the ordinary and the diminutive. We are so small, so alone and we have so little power, really. We can be picked off with the ease by the giant, sly demonic organisations which control our country and the planet. We are in the gun-sights of not only the hijackers, burglars, drug lords, rapists and savages who shoot people through toilet doors. We are in the cross-hairs of greedy, flawed 'journalists' who look for foibles in people (sometimes they even invent them) so that they can sell their newspapers; we are in the gun-sights of 'technicians' and even professionals who lie, cheat, mislead and steal. We are in the gun-sights of lawyers who will goad you to litigate (as happened with me with Pat Poovalingam) so that they can steal even more loot. We are in the gun sights of magistrates and judges who are happy to do lots of Nazi-like 'ethnic cleansing', but are soft on those whom they are delighted have been destroyed. The list is actually endless. It's the kind of stuff which barely has a look- in, in the school syllabi. Anyway, this was an amazing cinematic experience which I thought was well worth seeing.",Jurassic World

Children and simple minded teens may find Jurassic World's impressive CGI dinosaurs entertaining, but anyone expecting any complexity in the story-line or beyond-cartoonish characters/acting will be disappointed. If you just want to veg out and see a few man vs dinosaur battles this may fit the bill as well. Certainly Jurassic is watchable, and as usual it explores the possible societal relationships and methods of the dinos in an interesting way. Our involvement with the characters could easily have been improved with more character development and background. Overall though it's a fun if largely mindless romp though.",Jurassic World

594,pioneerlythere37,They Just Can't Contain the Dinosaurs,8,26 November 2015,"""Jurassic World"" is the fourth of the Jurassic film series, and the only one to not be adapted from one of Crichton's novels. And although the computer-generated-imagery is better than ever, it also carries with it a certain amount of cheesiness that the others (thankfully) lacked. What was the source of this ""cheesiness""? Two brothers, Zach and Grey, visit Jurassic World to see their Aunt Claire, but she has work to do so they have to tour Jurassic World on their own. The youngest is a highly emotional but clueless young boy, and the oldest is a high-schooler who is fascinated with girls, and while endangered on the island they form a bond. That's the part that makes the movie a tad cheesy. On the other hand, there's Chris Pratt, a raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard's Aunt Claire, both of which do a remarkable job of acting.The dinosaur escapee in this one is the Indominus Rex, who can camouflage (a characteristic he inherited from his TREE FROG DNA!!!!), and also detect thermal radiation, and teleport anywhere he wants to. Kidding on that last part, but apparently he's an insanely super-powered dinosaur, even bigger than a T-Rex. ""What have they cooked up in that lab?"" as one of the character asks. The answer? A very unappetizing reptile. Anyway, using his superpowers he inherited from Odin-osaurus, his father, he tricks the supervisors into thinking he escaped his confinement, and thus, using their naiveté as his weapon, (HUGE spoiler follows) he actually does escape. It appears they're never going to learn how to contain those dinosaurs.The action scenes are quite awe-inspiring, just not as thrilling as the previous Jurassic entries. Another foothold ""Jurassic World"" has over the other Jurassic movies is more amusing humor, from both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. Although not quite as good as the first Jurassic Park, Jurassic World is a worthy entry into the spectacular series.",Jurassic World
595,kevinthecritic,"This ""Jurassic World"" Has More Bite Then Expected, Despite Flaws",6,22 June 2018,"3 out of 5 stars (average)I will never understand Hollywood's seemingly immortal fascination with unnecessary reboots and sequels. Since 2010, reboots of popular franchises have been spewing out the back end during the summer months hoping to rekindle the spark gained from the originals. 80's classics Robocop and A Nightmare on Elm Street were given this treatment to mediocre results, both critically and financially. However, some reboots (like Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are successful because they take the franchise into the 21st century, exploring themes and ideas that the original could not.And sometimes, reboots are just fun pieces of escapism that are not meant to be analyzed, just enjoyed.Jurassic World falls into that category. While it isn't as good as the original (come on, who was really expecting that?), this film stands on its own two feet as a fun summer popcorn flick that doesn't require you to think very hard. This seems to be what makes money nowadays, and this film is set to break box office records. Despite some questionable script decisions, Jurassic World is an enjoyable popcorn movie with a great lead performance and intense action.The film follows Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of 50/50) the owner of ""Jurassic World"", a park where dinosaurs are on display for the general public. The park is a hugely popular tourist attraction made possible by Dr. Wu (BD Wong returning from the first film), a scientist who has been with the park since the beginning all those years ago.To increase tourism (because apparently LIVE DINOSAURS ALONE can't do that), the scientists have genetically engineered a dinosaur. This does not please park trainer and exhibit inspector Owen (Chris Pratt outshining everyone), who treats the dinos with the respect they deserve. It doesn't help that he has Hoskins (Vincent D'onofrio of Netflix's Daredevil) breathing down his neck about using the raptors as weapons of war, something that Owen would not allow. Unfortunately, the genetically-made dino escapes from its enclosure, sending Owen and Claire to find it. To make matters worse, Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) have come to the park to see their aunt and thus get involved on the action.This film is a lot better than I thought it would be. The action is very intense and most of the dinosaur effects are solid (most of them). Colin Trevorrow (the director of 2012's hit Safety Not Guaranteed) knows how to build tension surprisingly well given that this is his second theatrical release. I'm sad he will not be returning to direct a sequel to this film (and let's just face it, there will be one).Performance-wise, Chris Pratt proves once again why we love him: he has charm, likeability, and charisma unlike many new actors today. He uses his leading-man abilities very well here, outshining Bryce Dallas Howard and even the great D'onofrio (who was absolutely amazing on Daredevil). Howard is giving her second-best performance here, her first being 50/50. For whatever reason, Howard has yet to give a great leading performance in her career. She's not bad by any means, but I wish she would improve a bit. The child actors are surprisingly good (and not annoying), giving performances that seem realistic for the situation they are in (one is a teenager, the other a middle school aged kid). Finally, Irrfan Khan (seen briefly in the first Amazing Spider-Man) delivers a decent performance.The only problems I have with the film are minor ones. First, Claire is wearing heels throughout, running in them with unbelievable ease. I don't wear heels myself, but my sister said that it would be IMPOSSIBLE to run in them. I bring this up because there are several shots of the heels, almost as if the director wanted us to know that she was wearing them. They don't have a payoff, seeming a bit useless in the grand scheme. Also, it is briefly mentioned that the two kids' parents might get a divorce, but we don't see anything to support that. We see the mother (Judy Greer, who really needs to get larger parts) saying good bye in the first scene, and then again when she calls Claire asking about the boys. We never see her and the husband arguing, so it just seemed rushed in. Finally, I felt the opening act was a little slow, but it picks up after about 15 minutes. It's not boring, just character introductions and such.Jurassic World isn't as good as the original, but it does its job well, and that is entertaining the viewer. John Williams' great score is included here, and it's as hard to get out of your head now as it was back in 1993. There were some kids in my theater who weren't too scared by anything, but it depends on the kid. I actually jumped a couple times, but that's just me. Overall, Jurassic World is a fun action flick for the summer crowd.Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Sci-Fi Violence and Peril",Jurassic World
596,gloriahur,Entertaining but maybe a little too incoherent in story,6,13 March 2017,"Although extremely unrealistic and incoherent in the actual story line, this movie achieves its purpose to thrill and entertain the audience through high-quality visual and sound effects. No one actually expects any kind of emotive story or philosophical meaning in these kinds of movies. However, even without looking at the part about how well it delivered any kind of a message to the audience, there are flaws and inconsistency in the flow of the plot. There are also happening that really were not necessary, and some parts were just way to unrealistic that it made me lose focus and cringe at it. For example, there is no way a woman in skirts and heels can faster, or as fast as a T-Rex, even if it's a fake, man-made one. But still, the movie didn't get boring in any part unless the easily predictable story line does. For me, I didn't mind the usual old story, because I had watched it for the physical experience itself of watching the magical creatures and being scared by the way-too- loud roaring and screaming of both dinosaurs and humans.",Jurassic World
597,thealphakeno,Not your typical Jurassic Film.,9,10 June 2015,"I can tell you that this is not your typical Jurassic film like in the books or in the previous film. This movie has its realistic, bold and dark style of the story. Unlike the previous one which focus only on 'how we going to get out on this island?' thingy. This one is special; I rated it 90% for its unique flow of the story having equally handled the suspense, drama and comedy in every scenes.Lets talk about how its different from the other Jurassic film. This movie didn't focus on dinosaur at all but tackles about the effect of having a dinosaur to this era. Relationship between families and most of all the relationship of two different creatures. Animals and human relationship is hard to break and only few people experienced that, and that's what i felt between Owen (Chris Pratt) and his raptors.The characters; the siblings Gray and Zach and their brotherly relationship were a good way of remembering the Jurassic park 1 event with Tim and Alex. Claire's character was like the novel version of john Hammond. Dr. Henry Wu has a big comeback and it surprises me that he works on the dark side.The dinosaurs; although they said Baryonx, metriacanthosaurus, edmontosaurus, suchomimus and even pachycephalopsaurus are in the film. I haven't seen a glimpse of them. I was really hoping for baryonix but they failed me. Indominous Rex is the bad guy, well she really does and it's terrifying. I always jump on my seat in a pulse pounding scene. Mosasaur is the real hero together with the t-rex. I couldn't tell you more about it. The velociraptors shine in this one and they are like hero dogs in the movie.Overall it was a blast and perfect film for dinosaur lovers although for those who are not fan of Jurassic world franchise, you might get boring in some conversation due to it needs an explanation on what's really happening in the whole story. It's for your own good so better listen. I'm looking forward to the sequel and I hope there will be.",Jurassic World
598,zhdcndmr,"Felt like a lost opportunity, still good.",7,19 December 2015,"I think the best though that the writers had is, MORE BAD MORE EVIL. The movie was good in a way that most movies gets good when they are so invested in. I wasn't disappointed in that aspect. It wasn't wasted money but being a sequel to a classic I really didn't enjoy what it became. It was too similar the old one, theme parks, forests, trapped in cars. Honestly I got abit excited to the end but that was it. Nonetheless, the movie is watchable and I would recommend it but don't expect something way better then the ones before. Its just a good movie with a huge budget. You probably wont get bored but you wont be amazed with what happened either. No revolutionary evolving ideas here.",Jurassic World
599,hjbuhrkall,Family friendly and Disappointing,5,23 October 2015,"Let me initially say that before watching it, I had already heard quite a bit about this movie, so I might have been prepared for some of the letdowns it has to offer. That being said, I still ""enjoyed"" it as a simple piece of action: but please don't expect more. In the beginning of this movie we meet the two brothers Gray; a hyperactive walking encyclopedia, and Zach; an indifferent teenager with ""girl issues"", whom are sent to visit their aunt Claire. Claire happens to be a highly organized, suit and stiletto wearing, and in every sense of the words; professional manager of the theme park which is Jurassic World. Initially the kids are left with her incompetent assistant while Claire is busy entertaining investors, handling the financial situation of the park, and also greeting the visiting owner of the park, the idealistic Mr. Masrani, who has come to witness his new main attraction, ""The Indominus Rex"". ""Indominus"" was created in a lab, as a hybrid cross of a number of species, but mainly the notorious ""Tyrannosaurus Rex""; this was mainly done to secure a steady stream of visitors to the park.While inspecting the cage now containing a fully grown Indominus, Mr. Masrani feels it might be a good time to do a critical final inspection of the security measures taken to encage this huge, highly intelligent and murderous beast; Claire is therefor sent to retrieve Owen. Owen is your run of the mill, motorcycle repairing, leather west wearing, former navy seal with a big heart for living things, guy: Who also just happens happens to be an authority on breeding and training velociraptors! Second upon arriving at the new facility, Claire and Owen concludes that Indominus has escaped the cage, and everybody carelessly walks into the cage, just to be confronted by the hiding predator. Some ingenious designers decided to put a manual override button on the inside of the fence, and in no time has a panicking security guy opened the gate, and hence released this fierce monster.Besides the obvious idiotic idea of even opening a public park with 20.000+ visitors and freely roaming dinosaurs that are only restricted by an occasionally failing ""implanted chip"": we, the audience are from here on out witnessing an endless series of progressively worse ideas and even more clichéd cinematic plot turns. Let's make Mr. Masrani a novice helicopter pilot who thinks he's an Air-general! Let's have the two lead characters have a history of a really bad date, and the still end up together! Let's have a beautiful bonding moment between the two brothers after jumping from a cliff, oh and lets also try to make everybody feel bad for them because their parents are getting divorced (or well, one of the kids googled something, and now the parents are apparently divorcing each other)! Let's have a secret weapons development facility directly in the middle of a family theme park. And let the shady ""weapons researcher"" do a hostile takeover of the theme park, and turn the entire thing into a real live weapons test with 20.000+ people in the park! Also let's have none of the employees panic and raising the alarm, or in any way question the fact that some of them are sent out into the forest, with stun-guns and nets, to capture an enormous monster. Oh, and finally let's have a Tyrannosaurus Rex in a cage, which by the push of a single button opens directly into the main street of the theme park! This piece of cinematic pop culture is so filled with plot-holes, that by the end of the movie I couldn't even remember half of them anymore.There are though, still a few worthy scenes to notice: When the kids wander into the original buildings of Jurassic park, they walk past the notorious ""Velociraptor painting on the wall"": a scene I specifically enjoyed from the first movie. And also in the final minutes of the movies, during the big fight of ""Indominus VS. everybody else"" there were some quite good action sequences.All in all, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I though, perhaps a bit naively, that this movie would try to honor the legacy of the original Jurassic Park, but instead of a dark, thrilling and suspenseful movie with dangers lurking around every corner, we are presented with a somewhat cheerful, family friendly, PG13 ""Action"" movie with the occasionally cheesy one-liners.",Jurassic World
600,leoocampo,Lacking Substance,6,17 September 2018,"This franchise needs to die. When the first film came out, so many years ago, it was utterly groundbreaking in so many ways. The special effects, of course, were a milestone and a high watermark at the time. But it wasn't just that... there were good performances from the actors, and the script they were working with was itself innovative. Michael Crichton's book was itself pushing the edge. There was a lot there--meaty explorations of chaos theory, the relationship of human-kind and nature, of technology's role in evolution, and so many interesting questions. The dinosaurs were there to invoke the awe of unbounded natural force and of life.Now the dinosaurs aren't even dinosaurs. They are engineered monsters in what devolves into a simplistic creature feature. The Lost World at least had some merits in concept, though flawed in execution. But ever since JP3, it seems like they've embraced mediocrity on the precept that visual effects will get people to watch and carry the film. They may be right about the first part, but not so much the later.As much as I LOVED seeing a liopleurodon on screen in all its glory, by the time the film got to its conclusion I was burnt out. The final scene was underwhelming because of, not in spite of, its gratuity and it's following in a long line of other gratuities. Gone was the moment when slow tension would build before we could then bask in the exhilaration of finally seeing a T-Rex break free of its cage and thunder past our characters. A thunderstorm is awesome because of the unpredictable flashes of lightning. This film is just a bright light shining into your face non stop. Maybe someday they'll start refocusing on the lore, in the same way Rogue One did for Star Wars. Smaller stories that add to building the world, and where the big stuff is there, but situated to support, not drive, the story.",Jurassic World
601,mr-abarton,Monstrous Good Fun,8,28 July 2015,"Jurassic World is the fourth movie in the Jurassic series. The movie is directed by Colin Trevorrow and stars amongst others, Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins. Over twenty years have elapsed, since John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), failed in his dream, to build a theme park, housing live Dinosaurs. Now that dream has been realised, with a huge fully functioning park, known as Jurassic World, housing an whole array of prehistoric creatures operating on the very same Island.Brothers, Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) are sent to meet up with their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who happens to be the parks operations manager. However, on their arrival, they discover that Claire is far to busy trying to find backers to spend time with them and end up being escorted by her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath).Behind the scenes, lessons still need to be learned, as scientists splice the DNA of Dinosaurs, with that of present day animals, to create new, larger and more ferocious creatures. One of which, the Indominus Rex, is the parks new main attraction.Owen Grady (Pratt) trains the Velociraptors, with some quite astonishing results. Head of security, Vic Hoskins ( D'Onofrio), however, believes the Raptors true destiny lies within the US Military. A move that Owen strongly resists, which causes friction between the two.The parks owner, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), asks Owen to check over the new enclosure for the Indominus, before it's presented to the public. Owen immediately tells Clare, that the creature is dangerous, due to it only ever knowing solitude and isolation.A shock wave thunders through the park when it appears the Indominus has escaped. Clare and Owen enter the enclosure and suddenly realise that they're not alone as they come face to face with the beast.The creature makes a dash for freedom and makes it's way in to the islands interior and Masrani sends in a team to try and capture it. However, the team are slaughtered and Clare orders the immediate evacuation of the parks northern sector.Zach and Gray sneak away from Zara and ignoring the order to evacuate, continue in to a restricted zone in a gyro sphere (A strange spherical vehicle), to explore. They come under attack from the huge Indominus, but manage to distract it long enough to escape. They end up at the ruins of the old Jurassic Park visitors centre and manage to get a Jeep running and make their way back to the resort centre. The Indominus continues in it's trail of death and destruction, with all efforts to subdue the beast futile. Hoskins assumes command and comes up with a desperate plan to use the Raptors to track down the Indominus. However, things don't pan out as expected, as the Indominus has Raptor DNA and seems to have the ability to communicate with the Raptors, causing them to turn on the already terrified and powerless humans.The special effects are outstanding as are the interactions between humans and dinosaur, in this, the best of the Jurassic movies.",Jurassic World
602,LessThanPaddy,"Fun, but are all the characters THAT stupid?",6,27 March 2017,"Okay, I will TRY to not judge this film too much on it's obviously superior predecessor Jurassic Park... BUT, there will be some areas where that will be inevitable, but that is to be expected. No, I don't think this is a bad film, it's much better than the vast majority of the underwhelming CGI overkill films that are released nowadays. I would say its fun, but its not a masterpiece.Chris Pratt is fun, I don't know why but he is, and his character helps redeem this movies flaws. The idea of the park is too and so are some of the dinosaurs, but I don't see the attraction in the whole genetic manufacturing of new species, including the big bad one with that name I can't recall. What's wrong with the old dinosaurs? Honestly, they are dinosaurs, they will always be interesting so there is no need to create a pterodactyl with a T-Rex head and a Raptor's arse or whatever, there's just no need.Some of the visuals are fantastic, but they don't take away from the plot's gaping hole which for me played on my mind throughout the whole film. In the original, the workers at JP are sold out by Wayne Knight's character, yes the park had bugs but it fell apart based on betrayal. Whereas in JW, they are literally competent enough to build the theme park but alarmingly too stupid to maintain it. They have built the big bad dinosaur to have camouflage, and then get surprised when they couldn't see it in the cage? They fit with a GPS, and then don't check it BEFORE entering the cage, so they completely overreact and the creature has now outwitted them without even trying. They fitted it with camouflage and GPS and then lose their minds wondering where it is! Also, it may have been worth fitting the cage with a human sized door... pretty standard in any minor zoo, much less a prehistoric theme park. Thats where the disaster starts, but unlike the workers of JP, it is ALL their fault. Honestly, you'd think people in charge of such a big park would have a bit more common sense. There were other minor plot holes but this one got me the most.This doesn't completely destroy the film, it has it's strengths and is by no means un-watchable like other remakes. I liked Pratt's story with the raptors, although it probably could have done without using them like power rangers later in the film though... And I did appreciate the T-Rex (the original leviathan) saving the day in an albeit predictable manor. Yes, this film isn't without strengths.It is possible to love JP and still enjoy JW, I promise.",Jurassic World

The sequels paled in comparison. After walking out of Jurassic World, I am convinced I have just seen the 2nd best monster movie ever made. Just like a Godzilla movie or any other classic monster movie, after all the suspense associated with human casualties, this movie ends the way any great monster movie should, with the monsters fighting. The dinosaur battle at the end is the most impressive monster battle filmed.

605,abhisheksaha-619,Jurassic World is Not as Brilliant as Jurassic Park but still Impressive for the young generation,7,26 June 2015,"When I first watched Jurassic Park on TV, I was astonished. The dinosaurs looked so real, it blew my mind. The Genius of Steven Spielberg was the main reason behind Jurassic Park's huge success. But here in Jurassic World, We needed Spielberg as the director, not Colin Trevorrow. Jurassic World starts off with a good note with the side story of two young boys going for a trip to Jurassic World, which is managed by their aunt Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard). She looked hot and well mannered as the business woman in the white dress and stilettos.The two boys were very annoying, Ty Simpkins & Nick Robinson. Especially Nick the older one, who constantly looked disinterested in everything around him, except girls. He doesn't like dinos or any other stuff in the amusement park. So why the hell he has come for with his bro? Chris Pratt as Owen Grady looked convincing as the raptor controlling, life saving hunk. But I liked him more in Guardians of the Galaxy. I found it really hard to believe that a human can actually control raptors? Irrfan Khan was good as the owner of Jurassic World, Simon Masrani. He played an important role & a longer one unlike his ridiculous cameo in The Amazing Spider Man(that film was terrible). I loved when he was flying the chopper, but the 2nd time he did it, he died miserably(he asked for it). Bryce needs to improve her acting skills. It was very odd that how she could run with those high heels across the jungle when Indominus Rex was chasing her!Also the scene in the climax she sat in a sexy pose watching I-Rex & T-Rex fighting in front of her, so close, as if she was watching a dog fight. Really, What the Hell?Despite these flaws, I liked the movie because of its visual spectacle, not the storyline. The subtle twists with I-Rex origin, the hybrid factor, the huge Mosasaurus in the lake, I loved it. Also Pratt made it interesting in most of the parts. I loved when the archeopteryx globe broke and all the flying dino-birds went berserk.Overall, it's a fun watch with your family. But don't compare Jurassic World with Spielberg's masterpiece Jurassic Park, or else you'll be disappointed. I give it 9 out of 10, Cheers!",Jurassic World

608,jonny_keogh,Great fun but not without its flaws,8,5 July 2015,"Not really any major spoilers, but really depends on the overviews you have read about the film.Jurassic World is a movie I have been looking forward to since I found out last year it was being made. For me, I don't remember being this excited about a movie since War of the Worlds back in 2005.I knew it wouldn't be as good, or as original as the first Jurassic Park, but I did expect it to be better than the sequels. They did have 14 years between the 3rd and 4th installment so they had plenty of time to do it right.I won't go into the synopsis, as you can figure out the gist of the story from many reviews and summaries, but the story for me wasn't a great start. I thought the idea of a hybrid dinosaur was a little far-fetched (clearly a dinosaur movie isn't far-fetched enough) and it needed to show a bit more originality. But I went in to it with an open mind, and hoped the actors could deliver the same amount of charm as the originals did and I am glad to say that at least Chris Pratt did that.The rest of the movie was just a typical popcorn fun film. But it was simply a monster movie. It didn't really feel as though it was a Jurassic Park entry. Jurassic Park had the excitement but it made it suspenseful with scenes like the first meeting of the T-Rex, the electric fence, and the Raptors in the kitchen. Those three scenes for me epitomizes Jurassic Parks classic tag. This one doesn't really have anything suspenseful, apart from maybe the very first 'action'sequence with the Raptors. After this, the introduction of the new dino is a little tame, and the rest of the film is just typical dino carnage and you know when the attacks are going to come. Some of the aspects of the film were a little ridiculous too, like being able to teach the Raptors. That's the fairly negative part out of the way. The positives are that this movie is a major improvement on both sequels. I have rated it an 8 because it was just a fun movie to watch, and the effects were great. I liked that the park was fully functioning, and being a big theme park fan, I enjoyed watching all the attractions come to life like a proper theme park. The classic JP soundtrack was in there too which was great and they threw back to the original movie very nicely, and gave the original a glowing reference. Chris Pratt was a highlight of the film, as he carries the other actors through, but the biggest compliment I can give Jurassic World is that it made me feel like the Jurassic Park series was back to stay. The original is in my top 10 movies of all time, and this installment will not disappoint many fans of the series. Some will be cynical, some will just plain dismiss it because it isn't original. But it never was going to be, it was just a brilliant way to spend 2 hours, and kept me entertained right until the end credits. I would recommend to anyone who liked the previous 3 movies, or monster movies in general.",Jurassic World
609,markcasa-63624,I hate this.,6,11 June 2018,"Ok I really liked the trailer and when I first saw the movie around the time it came out I liked it a-lot. But then later as I began to watch more and more of the movie other time I began to realize I hated this movie and that it wasn't as good as people said it was. Ok for one why is it that everything goes wrong so easily. What people sometimes don't realise is that the entire film takes place in the span of around 16 hours. How does all this stuff go down in such a short amount of time. It takes just 2/3's of a day for everything to go to hell and everybody's lives being ruined forever. Then there are the two kids, while not being as bad as the first pair of kids in the first movie, I still don't really like them. Probably because in almost every scene there in, in the last 2/3's of the movie they are just magnets for the dinosaurs to attack. Also then theres there parents who as shown in one scene are getting a divorce. Now I know that in a movie that would be a good premise but in a movie with dinosaurs crawling around killing people not so much.Claire I thought was going to be your stereotypical work addicted character who was going to get killed but she gets better as the film goes on. But I liked her much better in the films sequel. Chris Pratt does a pretty good job as his character too. He's riding of the success of guardians of the galaxy and the lego movie and he plays his character well.With all that say I don't hate this movie that much but I do give this movie:6 out of 10.",Jurassic World
610,Rageypoo,A truly first impression of the movie in progress,5,15 June 2015,"This review will be typed out while watching the film, that way the very first impression isn't lost as the movie goes forward.(Beginning to 30 minutes in) ***SPOILERS*** OK, I can already feel the predictability. It's very hard to make a ""part 2"" to any series when you know what will basically happen. Since the audience knows this, it seems the directors wanted to instead focus more on the characters, which is...good and bad more or less. Already there is tension and conflict in chris pratt's character, and it seems forced and unnecessary. I hate to compare it to the first one, but that's usually easiest to do. In the first film Dr. Alan Grant is his own person, with his own goals and his own expertise that is expressed right from the get go, and is introduced in a way that, despite his expertise, this new situation makes it feel like he's completely out of his element. In Jurassic world however, I have no clue if chris pratt is a doctor or not, they just touch on the fact that he's ex navy, and go right into the drama of his position in the park, introducing problem after problem. Of course, the movie tries so hard to make every scene the magic scene, having the actors pose and look as pretty and intense as possible. I like a good glory shot, but I love the buildup more. Of course, keeping an open mind, I can hope the next parts will be better...(About 60 minutes in) So basically everything that could have just gone wrong, goes wrong, what a coincidence! At least in the first film there's a reason things go wrong, but this...It's just gross incompetence! Without checking to see if their ""thermal tracking"" might have simply malfunctioned, they go into the cage of the most aggressive dinosaur they ever engineered!? Who does that!? These camera angles to add to the drama that is already 30 minutes into the movie is just...laughable. I want to enjoy this movie, but it's down right ridiculous right now. I will say though I like how they portray the park, there are some really nice shots and the CGI isn't too tacky, It's just this plot line, the movie feels all over the place. From these drama shots to the militant park keepers, it's just as over the top as you can get. The ultramegazord hybrid just killed the typical expendable people trying to capture it, and wow the exposition is just so tacky, so unbelievably tacky, I just so bad! I can't stop shaking my head. I think enough is said for this part, lets move to the next minute marker.(Ok adding Jimmy Fallon just made all the over the top drama stomach- able, +1 that was refreshing.) Wait...did the phone seriously just spaz out for no apparent reason yet again? Are they seriously hoping their audience is gonna believe...wow OK moving on truly this time. (about 90 minutes into the movie) Cliché dinosaur barely alive fake tear/pointless connection scene, Pratt shoulders the gun, unshoulders the gun, walks a few feet, shoulders the gun, unsholders the gun, radios mess up for no reason, vehicles have sparks when broken but wouldn't do that in real life, and my god the people running the park casually talking about people dieing and what the dino is doing is just so so so so...wow! The only ones acting like anything that could happen if this was for real are the people in the park. This is by far the cheesiest thing I have seen in a very long time. They even had the dinosaur walking away from an explosion like a typical early 90's action movie! I'm speechless!! The only honest reaction to any of this are the people panicking after the pterodactyl outbreak. The best part is when Chris Pratt grabs a 2nd gun that he seems to never shoot, only to have Bryce Dallas Howard fire it and then they KISS afterwards!? Honestly this movie is SO crazy it's almost a comedy more than anything. There's really nothing more to say about this film. I hope people truly enjoy this movie, but for a typical audience I think this movie goes above and beyond to insult our intelligence in a way I didn't think was possible. I can't say it's a bad movie, it didn't make me stop watching it, but I did stop caring and that's never good. I gave it a 5 as a kindness, anyone rating this movie more is not rating the writing or directing of the movie, but the actors or perhaps even just glad to see another re-imagining.",Jurassic World
611,LenaSays,Successful reboot of an old franchise,10,16 June 2021,Very rare to see a reboot of an old franchise that's as good as this. WOW... Chris Pratt!!! Can't imagine anyone else in the Owen role. He really brought that character to life!,Jurassic World
612,nickdnk,Medicore reboot,6,10 June 2018,"It's what you'd expect really. Predictable, slightly boring, visually great (as with all modern sci-fi) but unfortunately not great entertainment. I found it to be pretty bland.",Jurassic World
613,Homersan,Jurassic Park: The Reboot,7,13 June 2015,"So, let me first say that... this is NOT a bad movie! I know, most of us were somewhat skeptical about another 4th franchise movie since **ahum** Indiana Jones **ahum** which I refuse to acknowledge exists. But anyway, I also had my reservations and was not really excited for this. But I went anyway without any expectations really.The good:Chris Pratt... I mean obviously. I'd almost watch it again just for him. He's definitely on the right track with his role choices and I hope to see more of him. Great mix of fun and action. Could be the next John Mclane or Indy if he wanted to. Jurassic Park memories. The beginning of the movie, where everything is just fine, you really get thrown back into the whole hype of dinosaurs. It's not on the same level as the actual Jurassic Park era but the soundtrack helps a lot. Still one of my faves.Special effects. OMG, it just all looks so realistic. Very impressed and not too much as would be very ease to go overboard with this.The bad: Story. Bad is not really the best word for it, it's rather safe than bad. If you haven't seen the movie yet but think about what the storyline will be, 9 out of 10 you'll be right. So nothing really out of the ordinary happens, although there are a few WTF moments for sure.Open ended... You all saw this coming right... you have to leave room for sequels if this one makes some dough. And it sickens me... but hey, chewing out sequels just for money is what Transformers are all about so. So yeah, I'm glad I saw it and it's a fun, somewhat brainless, action family movie. If you're gonna see it, do it in a cinema, just to hear the deafening roars!",Jurassic World
614,wasecan,Decent CGI dino-action. Bad everything else.,5,6 January 2016,"Pretty good use of CGI. Other than that, nothing but tired clichés, weak acting and even weaker storyline. The characters are 100% retreads of previous action films: The swashbuckling hero, the tougher-than-she-looks leading lady, the evil, profit-minded capitalists, blah blah blah, yada yada yada. Nothing here - and I mean NOTHING - is remotely original. You could actually have a reasonably good time playing the ""action-genre cliché"" drinking game (but be prepared to get smashed).In a nutshell, it's a passable CGI-fest, provided you don't expect anything resembling quality on any other front. A very forgettable, sub-par wannabe of the original.",Jurassic World
615,jvg37,IGNORE THE HATERS!!! This flick is seriously enjoyable!,9,11 June 2015,"After all of the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting to be let down. I wasn't! The special effects and 3D were spot on, the scripting was better than the last two(on par with the original), and the acting was better than some summer blockbusters. If you are capable of forgetting the last two Jurassic Park films, then this is the sequel the original deserved. The plot is plausible(for a film about dinosaurs)and I think too many people are trying to focus on the alleged social commentary instead of simply enjoying an entertaining movie. Yes, there are a couple of plot holes, but none that detracts from the caliber of the film, and the lack of believable chemistry between the two protagonists was the only real negative I can find. Go see it and be enjoyed!",Jurassic World
616,Challenger2013,Brings the Series Back to Impressive Form,8,15 June 2015,"It's been 22 years since ""Jurassic Park"" amazed and probably scared the hell out of audiences, and 14 years since the franchise last appeared on screen. Is the fourth installment worth the wait? Yes, it is. It doesn't deliver a wonderful installment like ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" did earlier this summer, but it successfully revives the franchise and nearly returns it to the glories of the first film. The film is set on the theme park after 22 years of success. With attendance at a low point, frontrunner Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) introduces Indominus Rex: a genetically- engineered dinosaur hybrid containing the DNA of a number of difference species. Obviously, things go wrong, Rex escapes, and it's up to Claire and our hero Owen (Chris Pratt) to save Claire's two nephews and the rest of the visitors of the park while trying to contain the rogue dinosaur.The film succeeds mostly because it knows that it is a big-budget summer blockbuster. It has the common clichés: the dramatic kiss amongst the violence, the lackluster script, etc. These are mostly forgivable because of the dazzling special effects and the well-done action sequences. The more unforgivable problem is with the characters. It seems as though each is constructed to follow a recognizable trope. There's the unbeatable hero, the villain who wants the dinosaurs for military weapons, the teenager who appears dopey and completely against all adults, and the manager who is overly organized and focuses too heavily on her work. This causes issues because it makes our hero the only real lovable character. This is largely because of the always-great Chris Pratt. He gives the performance the film needs and does what he can with the script he is given. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his co-star, Howard. Despite Pratt's performance, the real stars of the film are the dinosaurs, especially the Indominus Rex. They are intricately designed and beautiful to see on screen. This is why the good outweighs the bad. The focus is on the dinosaurs, as it should be. That's where the spectacle lies. ""Jurassic World"" is not a better film than ""Jurassic Park,"" but it is definitely more fun, thrilling, and even terrifying. It encapsulates what an action-themed summer blockbuster should deliver. It's the type of film where you can turn your brain off for a bit, and enjoy the exciting ride. This franchise is back, and this installment does not disappoint.",Jurassic World
617,anymouse2,The film everyone WANTS to hate,8,21 June 2015,"And I really don't know why.The Feminazis got their panties in a wad because the corporate ice queen who decided that career was more important than anything, and didn't even look at the creatures she was charged with as anything more than number on a sheet, grows a heart, shoots down flying dinosaurs, and turns into the classic ""Cowgirl"", able to stand next to her man as an equal in every way, and do it looking like a lady. Somehow this is ""sexist"". Proof you'll never shut the feminazis up, so can Hollywood finally stop trying? All the ""brilliant"" commentary about dinosaurs and what can and cant be done: Its a giant fantasy. The greatest amount of discovery has only happened in the last decade; scientists are still trying to understand it, you can bet Hollywood ain't even heard about it yet. ""Genetics has taught us more than centuries of digging in the dirt"" was the simple truth.The actors act like ACTUAL HUMANS would. Somehow that pisses everyone off. Sure, its trope-y; tropes exist mimic real life. You think the responses are unrealistic, how about we throw you onto an island where everything call you lunch and see how you react.Most of the ""flaws"" and ""plot holes"" are either blatant incomprehension on the part of the reviewer, or they didn't pay attention, as the one who considered the spheres a ""flaw"", when the film actually wasted over a minute explaining why they were supposed to be safe. Or questioning why a .44-70, a round used to kill rhino and elephants, is ""stupid"" to bring against dinosaurs. Biology is biology, put lead in the brain, heart, or lung, and it don't get back up.Now about the film: The plot is a rehash of the first film. The CGI is great. Most the acting is decent, if you're looking for human responses.Its not as good as the original, but not as bad as the sequels.",Jurassic World
618,hennyxu,A worthy sequel to Jurassic Park.,7,17 June 2015,"""Jurassic Park: An adventure 65 Million Years in the Making"" and after two less than stellar sequels and 22 years they've finally managed to make a fun and worthy sequel to the first movie. So what is this film about? In short, they've officially opened the park under the name Jurassic World and the park is doing well enough. However, to increase profit/ratings etc. they've decided to create something big and scary. This monster escapes from captivity and starts causing problems for the entire park. Resulting in our protagonists, played by Chriss Pratt (from: Guardians of the Galaxy) and Bryce Howard (from: The Village), to find a way to stop it and save the island.After watching this film I have to admit that it was more enjoyable than I had expected, while it was far from perfect it was most certainly better than movie 2 and 3. Sure there were moments that really pushed my suspense of disbelieve and it even jumped the shark 1 time, however this didn't take away the fact that it was an enjoyable film to watch. The most important thing for me is that they brought back the sense of wonder and discovery something that was just glanced over in the previous sequels and totally neglected in other movies (yeah I'm talking about you ""Jupiter Ascending""). This sense of wonder is achieved by the use of practical effects and GOOD use of CGI (this is something I would love to write about in the future). However, the most contributing thing about the movie is John Williams's score. He brought back the old theme to create a sense of nostalgia for old viewers (like me  ) and truly expanded the music creating an, for the lack of a better word, Jurassic atmosphere. Three act structure: The beginning of the movie is truly the gem. This is the part that introduces/reintroduces us to the Jurassic and from a child's perspective we are shown how wonderful dinosaurs are (at least it shows us how pretty they are to look at). The movie uses references to Jurassic Park and ups the wow factor with its music and grandness that is Jurassic World with wide camera shots and overviews of the park. We are also introduced to the protagonists and antagonists and this is all done in a likable way. I do have to admit that the introduction of the movie's plot (the monster) was regrettable since this felt like something from another movie. The middle: In my personal opinion I thought this was the weakest part of the film. Maybe with a little more build up or tension it would have been better. I would call this part the CHASE or the HUNT (depending on the perspective). The good thing is that we see our protagonists handle with real props and practical effects, which contributes to the feel of the movie. However, I think they should have used this part to better develop the antagonists since they weren't well developed at the end (IMHO).The End The movie picks up the pace and combines the best of everything that happens in the movie. Sure this is the part that you'll have to suspend your sense of disbelieve to truly enjoy it, but the pace and action well make up for it. It is a great ride to the finish. The Good: - Great Music Score by John Williams - A lot of Easter eggs for movie enthusiasts - Good beginning - Likable characters - Sense of wonder and excitement - T-RexThe Bad - 3D is not worth it. I'm sick and tired of this stupid gimmick. Yes there are movies made for 3D and they do look amazing, but most movies are just 3D filtered using computer software. If possible do not watch this in 3D. - Antagonists needs to be better developed - Movie length. I think it needs at least 10 min cut to improve the pacing a little. - Pushed the suspense of disbelief to the limit and it jumped the shark 1 time. - Some movie quibblesThe dinosaurs are back looking better than ever. It's not a perfect movie but it is a good sequel to a great movie. It is a bit long with 124min but it is a ride worth taking. Plus it has baby triceratops that has to be a plus right? I liked this movie and I'm very curious about the sequel(s).",Jurassic World
619,mhol111964-754-567942,"While it may not be the perfect follow-up, Jurassic World is a fun thrill ride.",8,10 July 2015,"This film is enjoyable for the most part. It introduces some new dinosaur hybrids which are cool as well as it features some of the classic dinosaurs that we are familiar with.The characters are likable and entertaining. I like the protagonists Owen and Claire and Claire's two nephews Zach and Gray. Our four main characters had good chemistry and you care for them when they are in dangerous situations.I think Colin Trevorrow did a good job directing. It is visually impressive and the special effects are quite well done. It has some intense moments and I absolutely loved the final scene. I like the references and connections that it had with the first film.However, I had a few problems with the film. One of them is the storyline. The story is a bit thin and too much of a repeat of the first film. Another problem that I had is the acting. While the acting is not bad, it was a bit uneven at times. Also, I think the comedic moments, while clever, could have been funnier.Overall, I enjoyed Jurassic World and would pick it any day over ""Jurassic Park III"". I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Jurassic Park and/or dinosaur in general.In the end, ""Jurassic World"" may not be the perfect follow-up to Jurassic Park and it may have needed more work in the story department, but it is a fun (and albeit nostalgic) thrill ride that should satisfy blockbuster goers.",Jurassic World
620,anish-25809,The best Jurassic Park sequel.....which really isn't saying much.,7,3 June 2016,"Jurassic World will now join the club of movies that are actually rehashes but are not ready to admit it.Just like Star Wars,this movie tries to recapture the magic of the original movie and ends up nowhere close to it.I really like Chris Pratt and I wish his character had more depth.It is filled with other one-dimensional characters.The dinosaurs are portrayed nicely with CGI but the sight of them fighting among humans is just crazy and super hard to buy into.The Indominus Rex is one wild villain and is a lot of fun to watch.But this movie just does not bring anything new.The writing is not awful but not so great either,and there are a lot of unanswered questions such as -How did the girl outrun a T Rex in high heels? Why did they give a creature which is supposed to be in public view the ability to camouflage? How did the main hero convince the raptors to fight for humans instead of their own kind? This has been seen before in the 2014 Godzilla,but that movie made way more sense.Overall,the movie fails to entertain,involve or thrill,and though it puts up a valiant effort to recapture the magic of the original,it just can't do it.",Jurassic World
621,jenjentaro,Starts off slow but finishes strong,7,10 June 2016,"My initial thoughts of the movie was meh. The kids served no greater purpose to the film other than being the subject of rescue. The beginning where the movie introduced the kids and their family problems were all very pointless and boring. The movie only became better when Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard entered the scene and became the main focal point of the movie. (Why didn't the main characters start of the film is my question).The beginning of the movie lacked direction but it gathered itself once the crisis began. Chris Pratt's character Owen is so cool. I also really like how this film has a strong female character who is smart and is equally tough. References to Jurassic Park definitely made this installment nostalgic.As a side note, the unique part of the movie promotion is that Jurassic World and Masrani have their own website as if it exists in real life. Now that's pretty cool.",Jurassic World
622,frickabee,"No plot, miscast and horribly written, directed and acted",2,11 November 2016,"This movie was so stupid, you would swear that it was directed by Michael Bay or Jar Jar Abrams, the type of Hollywood jerk who never seems to go away, even after beating franchises like Star Trek and Star Wars to death.The plot is a totally original. Somehow, yet another Jurassic Park exists with no explanation of where it came from and the main characters once again travel to the island only to find themselves running from the dinosaurs later to escape from being eaten... Brilliant.The director, Colin Trevorrow is now slated to write and direct Episode 9, no doubt ending that franchise on a low note. The characters in this movie are so vapid and one-dimensional, you will find yourself rooting for the dinosaurs, hoping they will kill lots of people in some grandiose fashion like in the previous installments. It tries to be suspenseful, but fails miserably. Chris Pratt, who was terrific in Guardians of the Galaxy looks totally out of place in this one, displaying the same idiotic expression on his face throughout the entire film that never changes. This movie is far worse than The Lost World and that's saying something.",Jurassic World
623,johngraham1964,Such a shame...,3,15 June 2015,"Apart from the plot holes which are pointed out elsewhere on IMDb this is also a tired rehashing of earlier films. Let's create a badass dinosaur which then gets loose and starts killing people. Only this time, as the badass dinosaur never actually existed, it doesn't have the same feeling of reality as, say, the T Rex or the 'Raptors. We even have the 'taking the dinosaur embryos' plot line thrown back in. And the children stranded in the park. Oh and after 22 years of storage I'd love to know how the jeep battery still had a charge in it... Of course no-one running the park has learned any of the lessons from the previous films. A couple of neat special effects does not a great movie make (See Star Wars 1, 2 and 3!!!). And why was so much of the action shot so darkly? I know it was night but in the climactic battle it was difficult to tell which was T Rex and which was genetically enhanced dinosaur....or who was winning. They say they want a sequel. Well do something different or it's just raptors and rexes again....",Jurassic World
624,rich-874-542858,"All the charm of the original, redeems the franchise from 2 and 3.",9,15 June 2015,"I was very dubious about this film. JP2 wasn't a great movie and 3 was a train wreck. Admittedly the scene in the trailer with the raptors running alongside Chris Pratt on a bike made me very sceptical, but all of that was immediately demolished.Assuming that we are prepared to believe a movie where dinosaurs are brought back from extinction and become theme park attractions, any other logical failings in the film are permissable.For me, the movie recaptured all the charm and the oomph of the first film. Yes we know the format by now, and this film had its fair share of predictable moments, but somehow this film still had an edge to it. It was like being 8 again and seeing this concept for the first time.The fact that it's set in a working theme park, which for me really reminded me of both Universal Studios and Disneyland in California, made this a more tangible concept.What I especially appreciated were the homages and nods to the original movie. I'm also pleased that they honoured Stan Winston and Richard Attenborough in the set design.I also enjoyed that the film had a more gritty edge to it than the first - still not very graphic but the gore wasn't simply implied this time round as it had been earlier.Great stuff. I hope that if there's to be a sequel it will be as good as this.",Jurassic World
625,Chris12955,Close the Gate,7,28 June 2015,"While I cannot say I disliked Jurassic World, there were many inept elements and a feeling of been there, done that. The children in distress, dinosaurs on the loose, greedy industrialists, the sensible man no one listened to, where have I seen that in this series of films? It doesn't help that while most of the dialogue is decent, we get the occasional scene of inept writing. Add to that things like, ""I'm the Alpha Raptor,"" a poorly thought out plan for the villain, and an oddly knowledgeable Superdino, and things can get dumb real fast. This isn't to say Jurassic World has nothing to offer. The film is good diversionary entertainment with solid directing. It clips along at a good pace and engages with enough fun and thrills to maintain our interest.The film picks up twenty two years after the first film. Isla Nublar is now a fully fledged amusement park that continues to see increasingly more patrons and money every year. Despite the exponential success, park supervisor Claire FEELS that the park is in financial hardship and wants to expand the ""wow factor."" A new hybrid dinosaur(the Indominus Rex) has been engineered to accommodate this desire. As a matter of course, dino chaos ensues shortly thereafter. Claire along with Raptor trainer Owen strive to save her visiting nephews and stay alive in the process.I would be remiss if I did not mention the dinosaurs. They look very good, befitting the money and time spent on the project. As always with the Jurassic Park series, the dino action is nice and a solid appeal. I would say that the herbivores got a much nicer showing here than in the previous two entries(which I appreciated.) Ultimately, while I enjoyed the film, and it is better than Jurassic Park III, I don't see a need for another journey into the park.",Jurassic World
626,geegsforu,If you loved the Park you'll Love the World.,10,19 June 2015,"I went into the cinema with an open mind. Could they really create the same magic from the original? I would say YES! Okay, there's nobody (apart from Henry Wu-from Jurassic Park and who has a bigger role to play) in this movie from the original films but the director did state that it wasn't about throwing the same people into the same scenario over and over again. Nostalgia wise there's plenty for you to sink your teeth into and you will find yourself saying ""I remember that"" which is both thrilling and comforting. The new characters are great and add a new freshness to the franchise. The CGI is actually quite impressive. I couldn't really fault it. There are a few situations in this movie where you feel that edge of seat terror (Gyrosphere scene) and also a couple of genuine funny moments. The dinosaurs are a spectacle to see and the park itself looks totally lush. The story ticks along nicely as your straight in there from the start. You of course know things are going to go awry but that's the fun of it. It certainly brought me back to my youth and my 7 year old nephew loved it as much as I did. Definitely give it a go and maybe you will feel that rich sensation of something so familiar yet something exciting and new which both combined make a genuinely mega sci-fi spectacular !!!! Basically Jurassic World ROCKED MY WORLD!!!! Go see it!",Jurassic World
627,tyelder,Nostalgia.,10,28 June 2018,"That's what made this blockbuster even more enjoyable along with the action and adventure (3/4 of the movie). Exciting twists and turns and suspenseful edge-of-your-seat moments are what make the flick one to not miss. Spielberg out did himself once again, never letting us down, as always. Bringing in familiar themes and the iconic John Williams master piece. My vote for the best remade film of the year and maybe even decade. High above the others or should I say chasing them.

628,huey2088,The same Hollywood blockbuster sequel formula plus more sexism,5,5 June 2016,"So from the first Jurassic Park movie, we know how dinosaur DNA were extracted and then manipulated by scientists in order to breed them in a theme park. Then we found out that the velociraptors were highly intelligent. Humans became their targets when they broke out of their containment. The raptors had a battle with a T-rex in a pivotal scene.With these points in mind, Jurassic World will take you back to the same thrills that made the first movie a global sensation. It's the same formula which Hollywood blockbuster sequels rely on. Sequels are purely money making films targeting the next generation. I actually thought Colin Trevorrow intended the irony when Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire explains that Jurassic World spends lots of money to create 'new' dinosaurs every few years to continually draw the crowd in. And people want dinosaurs that are bigger, scarier, louder and that can only be developed with vast amount of money. What is the starting cost these days for blockbusters? $US150m? Apart from the money motive, Jurassic World does attempt to make the characters believable and relatable. When the central human characters are not running away from dinosaurs, they are dealing with issues such as divorce, brotherly love, humans trying to control nature and good old sexism.Claire is an organised and powerful CEO running Jurassic World. But she comes across as too uptight and controlling, so in the midst of true survival mode, she shows Chris Pratt's Owen that she is a fighter by undoing her blouse to which he asked, ""What does that mean?"" She then runs around with her chest heaving in a tank top and throughout, she keeps her stilettos on while wielding guns. And if that doesn't take the credibility away, the ending will because it's a Hollywood cliché. Claire changes from an awkward estranged aunt to a clucky mother type over her nephews (Ty Simpkins & Nick Robinson). No wonder, as she is also reminded by her sister Karen (Judy Greer) that when she has her own children, she'll see they are worth it. And I might add that she'll never know if she keeps her high flying career - but wait, she messed it up big time with rogue dinosaurs. So here comes the Hollywood ending. Claire gradually becomes fond of Owen because he's the alpha (at least to the raptors he was training) and her nephews adore him for his badass skills and he is very attune to nature. In the final scene as they walk away, he says to her, 'We'd better stick together for survival.' Really? Like procreate or is that hinting at another sequel?The acting is good, Pratt is likable and Howard can cry at the drop of a hat. There are some good bits in between. One of course is when the original T- rex was brought back to fight the Indominus Rex (with the help of a raptor) which is a subtle reminder of JP as well as all the 'versus' blockbusters out there, 'Alien vs Predator' anyone? Then true to its over the top CGI style that ruined it for me when for no good reason, the mosasaurus leaps out of the tank water and eats Indominus Rex. The five stars are really for bringing back the great memorable scenes of the first movie. There is nothing new here, just like Indominus Rex - a genetically modified bit of cuttlefish, frog and a whole lot of dinosaur. But not a real one with substance.",Jurassic World
629,shanfan_14,As expected,7,14 June 2015,"Obviously, and I have to include similar assessments of Age of Ultron, there is no way to recapture the utter magic of seeing a new and astounding thing for the first time, but audience expectations often seem not to take that into consideration for subsequent installments, especially for blockbusters. The CG was effective in allowing us to suspend our disbelief and embrace the notion that the creatures were there. The occasional sequel is better than the original (Mission Impossible 4, for example), but I don't attend a movie anticipating how far short it will fall. Impressions and opinions will, of course, be formulated after the fact, but don't forget that this is fun fare, thus largely illogical. Did it have annoyances? Oh, yeah: most of the characters, but Chris Pratt was terrific. The animals were suitably scary and the action did not lag. I'm not sure, however, how any sequels are going to play out in a movie-believable way, unless the action is shifted to another locale. Also, a major question, for me and many others: what happened to the can of Barbasol Nedry dropped in the original? I completely expected that the next chapter would constitute someone finding it and picking up the reins to recreate the nightmare. Still waiting on that one. I did have some eyebrow-raising moments when the raptors and the T worked together and seemed, anthropomorphically, to acknowledge each other as they went their separate ways. Ditto the raptor moment with Owen, at the end. Also, a time-honored notion among these kinds of movies never fails to befuddle me: the use of uncontrollable, enormous carnivores--or genetically enhanced ""super soldiers""--as ""weapons"". Regardless of their size, an encounter with high-powered explosive devices would negate all else. And, let's face it, an enemy isn't going to see these building-size things coming at them and simply wait around to be hot lunches. While the I-Rex was a ""stealth"" dinosaur, camouflaged in a jungle, it would not be invisible in the open. The raptors had no such advantage so, again, the idea of such creatures as military assets has always been ridiculous. The principals in these movies proceed on the premise that these no longer extinct creatures were an attraction for theme parks and they were largely ignorant or dismissive of what they were actually unleashing. Aside from the entertainment value, the clear warning: never underestimate nature. ""Inventing"" a dinosaur for commercial purposes, well, some who were eaten--and some who should have been--got what they deserved. I also wonder, since Hammond said, at the end of TLW, that the animals should be left alone, for the safety of both sides, how his entire caveat was overlooked and others forged ahead, especially on an island which belonged to and was controlled by another government. Oops. Logic. Well, there has to SOME. Still, glad I went and enjoyed.",Jurassic World
630,captain_dimpf,No Surprises,6,23 February 2017,"Look, I enjoyed this film, OK. Dramawise everything was in place and the two kids were so unlikable, that you actually enjoyed when they were getting the scare of their lives. Of course, the plot is a tad too predictable in that it just recycles the story line of old Jurrasic flicks, i.e., greed trumps common sense and safety last. There is just one thing that doesn't make sense at all. If the marketing team of Jurassic World is in desperate need for a new Park sensation, why oh why design a Dinosaur that looks and behaves pretty much like the T Rex. I get it, they need that for the final Boss Fight, but there it becomes so blatantly obvious that the new monster is exactly like the old monster, so much as I had trouble to figure out which one was which.",Jurassic World
631,quinn-cunniff,Fun but overall bad,6,26 July 2015,"Hey guys it's quinn c from YouTube and today we take a look at what will probably be the highest selling movie ever, Jurassic world.But anyways, this film really does have a lot of problems. Because I avoided all of the Jurassic park sequels, I went straight from the original to this film. And honestly the biggest problem with the movie is how they deal with the main dinosaurs. Although the velociraptors were super cool by themselves, the idominous Rex or trex on steroids was so powerful that honestly you kind of knew how this film would play out. And you guessed it, it turned into a straight up monster movie. This film honestly was a more contained version of Godzilla from last year, so instead of Brian Cranston you get chris Pratt, and instead of the guy from kickass you get a cartoonish workaholic aunt and two kids. And besides the fact that there was some really great homages to the first Jurassic park movie, if this film didn't take place in a theme park it would literally be Godzilla.But there were just a few small things that I completely hated. Product placement is something I don't usually mind, but this film is so blatant that it actually pisses me off. Like every time they drive a car it's basically an ad for Mercedes Benz, they have a closeup shot a chris Pratt enjoyed a tall cool coke, hell a guy talks about how you can buy Jurassic world shirts online. It's just so infuriating and I know they kind of poke fun at it in the movie, but just because you make a joke about it doesn't mean you can just turn around and do it for the next two hours and expect a free pass. One other really minor minor thing. I've only ever seen this in the trailer for cloverfield, but it felt like whenever they did cgi, and they wanted to emphasize something, like a spaghetti western zoom in shot of the thing would occur. And it's OK to do it once, but it's so infuriating when they do it ever single time someone is about to die, to do this sort of cheep cgi zoom in that only occurs by the way with cgi, to just keep repeating the same style of bad stuff was just lazy and annoying.And then of course there is the fact that the one lady is running around the entire park the entire film in heels, how the one dinosaur had no thermonuclear reading which I don't think they explained and I still don't think is possible, how they repaired a car when ever possible replacement part has weathered the same as the stuff in the car itself, and I could go on its just you guys get the point.Now i hate to be a complete Debbie downer it's just I've heard so many people call it the best thing ever that I just want to get a little real with you guys. And to be fair, I did like this movie, it's just for ever cool thing, something stupid or annoying had to happen that sort of ruined the moment. Like there was a really cool sort of video cameo mid way through, the end fight was awesome, and that one dinosaur in the water was by far the most awesome thing I've ever seen. But on the flip side, when all the velociraptors start talking to each other, how one of them saves the day in the cheesiest shot of him running that I've ever seen, and the way over the top, orson wells look alike winner military guy, what I'm saying is is that this movie is a lot of fun, it's just also very stupid.Overall, I like this film, I really do. The hype is a bit much, but for what it is it's pretty fun. Go see it if you haven't already, even though inside out is way better, but overall, With a score of 6.8, it's fun just not mind blowing.Now if you guys want more in-depth reviews of films, be sure to check me out at 'Quinn C' on YouTube.

632,r_massey,Surprisingly not bad!,6,24 June 2015,"**Very mild spoilers**Just when you think Hollywood are going to butcher another franchise with some unnecessary reboot or sequel, the execution of ""Jurassic World"" actually works well enough for it be watchable and possibly exceed expectations for those who had their doubts (I certainly had mine before entering the theatre). This can mainly be pinned down to the cast, starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson, whose characters are all (eventually) likable enough to want to follow their journey, especially Pratt, who was initially criticised for appearing too 'wooden' with his role when the first trailer made its way online. ""Jurassic World"" thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously either, with a nice handful of jokes and light-hearted moments scattered throughout, mainly in the latter acts of the movie.The film is dazzling, its vibrancy making it visually appealing to large audiences and also contributing to the fact that the film is not meant to be incredibly 'serious' (by alternatively employing a dark and washed out colour palette; a trope popular with 'rebooted' movies to imply a somber, grittier re-telling of a popular story). The CGI, which is definitely something of concern when involving the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, can look incredible at times (the Mosasaurus being my favourite example) but is undeniably overdone, especially when the previous trilogy evinced that animatronics are a plausible alternative in the appropriate shots. The illusion of dinosaurs being real and tangible in this movie universe is sadly broken by the overwhelming use of CGI.As a result, one of the major aspects missing from the film is the 'wow' factor that the previous movies instilled; dinosaur reveals just aren't exciting enough, especially when ""Jurassic World"" takes too long to even reveal the dinosaurs in the first place. Also disappointing is the fact that one of the first times we hear the grand and well-recognised ""Jurassic Park"" theme, composed by John Williams, is not for the dinosaur reveals but for a shot to establish the 'updated', modern theme park, glistening with standardisation and uniformity as it looks no different to any other immaculate holiday resort that we might expect, making the audience feel more 'amazed' by this 'modernised' park than the dinosaurs themselves.However, this all ties in to the themes and comments made on society's present consumerist ways, the fact that we want 'bigger' and 'better', the whole reason for creating the hybrid dinosaurs in the first place; we have been so used to seeing the various dinosaurs in ""Park""'s trilogy that the novelty has now worn off, hence the introduction of hybrid dinosaurs, a means to reel in a bigger audience and generate more excitement (and revenue).The Indominus Rex, the result of hybrid experimentation, is an interesting concept to begin with but soon loses its novelty as the film progresses. This terrible lizard can be easily replaceable with a 'Spinosaurus' or any other large, intimidating carnivore, and subsequently produce no change in the latter half of the movie whatsoever.""Jurassic World"" makes it tempting to dose off in the first half of the film as it takes its time to introduce its attractions and dinosaurs, most of which were spoiled and revealed in the trailer anyway. After most of the plot devices and characters have been established, however, the movie finally grabs your attention and launches into the action, although more of an effort could have been made to create more suspense and tension as the stakes just never feel high enough, especially with the main characters, who hardly feel as if they're in danger.Cutting right to the bone, ""Jurassic World"" is a solid film. While it isn't the most innovative out of the whole franchise and is sadly missing the 'wow' factor from its predecessors, it is entertaining enough and not too somber to appeal to and reel in wide audiences everywhere. Fans of the original ""Jurassic Park"" will also appreciate the many nods and easter eggs found throughout. I wouldn't particularly recommend ""Jurassic World"" but at the same time, I have no reason for deterring anyone to watch it at all.",Jurassic World
633,gollumsmeagolrocks,"Plot Devices, I mean Characters, and NEW IDEAS FOR ONCE!",1,19 January 2016,"Jurassic World is the only worthy sequel to the original, as the other ones only serve as unneeded spin offs about random happenings in the fictional universe. This, however, realizes the story of Jurassic Park wasn't so much about the Dinosaurs as it was about their creation and the science behind it. The other movies just had people vaguely interacting with the Dinosaurs, not expanding upon this cloning science. This movie smartly serves as a direct sequel because it introduces the idea of splicing multiple pieces of Dinosaur DNA together to create an ideal or modified new species. It also smartly serves as a direct sequel by actually talking about the Park in question, where the sequels took place on some other island with events having no direct affect on the Park or the dinosaurs there in the end. Different people in the fictional universe unconnected to those working on the park, such as Ingen and other scientists working on something new, were plaguing the sequels but here it we know what the main players are up to after all these years.The problem I have with this movie is obviously the characterization. The story has many similar notes to the original but how those similar events are carried out in a new way make the movie watchable. The new ideas presented make it interesting but it was almost difficult on the first viewing because I genuinely did not care even a little bit about a single character in this, other than the Ingen Scientist from the original film. The characters were just there to fill the roles they were needed for, but that was it. They didn't add a new personality to go with it, they just had them carry out their roles and nothing more. Furthermore, the constant shoving down our throats that we shouldn't care about the park as Dinosaurs are old news and don't matter makes me bored because it makes the viewers think the dinosaurs are boring, making us care less about the main events. It's very difficult to ignore which would make caring about the positive part of this movie, the story, easier.",Jurassic World
634,artgutierrez,Fun to watch but very unrealistic,4,15 July 2020,"This is one of those movies where you just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride. How many times can they rehash the exact same plot where humans go into a dinosaur environment and get eaten by them? That formula got stale after the 2nd J.P. movie.

635,mjbset,Why Are We Rewarding Bad Writing?,2,4 July 2015,"So the is another entry from Spielberg that has a terrible script. Calling it bad writing would be unfair to writers who actually where giving freedom to write a compelling story and failed. This was not the case here. No, the producers wanted Dinosaur X to fight dinosaurs A, B, and C and told the writers now make it happen. So what you get is a story full of characters that are only there as excuse to get that particular camera shot of the dinosaurs. They all behaved so illogically that I cheered for he dinosaurs to eat almost every one of them. You can have good writing in blockbuster movies but when you restrict writer to creating camera shots and fight scenes you get garbage. My question is why would any writer put their name on such a garbage script? I have to admit I feel a little bit of shame for tagging along with my family to a movie that I had low expectations for. Because that 10 dollars went to reward this poor effort and goes along with millions encouraging producers not to care about good scripts. When this movie exceeded the worse of my expectations, I had to write a review. Moreover after hearing that this was the number 1 movie at the box office, I knew this travesty needed to be exposed. I even feel bad for criticizing the writers so much because I don't know what kind of deadline they were working with. But the result looked and felt like a lazy effort. The compelling characters in the whole movie were Chris Pratt's character and his 1 assistant played by Omar Sly. I would have cheered for everyone else to be eaten The characters not being consistent and behaving illogically reminds me of Prometheus (2012). I think that movie received so much flak because other movies in the series featured smart resourceful, consistent characters that drove the movie. The writing is so bad in this movie that these writers are on my ""wait for it to show up on cable"" list. Truly horrible and I wish I had a larger scale differentiate it from other bad movies that received a 4 from me.",Jurassic World

(like Tomorrowland)The ancient animals are rendered more realistically than in the 1990s documentaries, especially their movement. However, there is a terrible lack of fantasy about their colors, like mother nature made all of them grey and with no hair, no feathers, no patterns. Basically, a lot of them look like... fat plucked hens! - like those you see frozen in the supermarket. The park is managed by incredibly stupid people when it comes to security. They are totally unprepared and use toy rifles to deal with huge monsters as most of the latter have bulletproof scales. The telecoms are a mess, because probably they'd never tested that before! But the script is stupid as a whole, the story is blurry and the suspense is frequently killed by stupid out-of-place jokes. No matter how hard you try, you cannot take this film seriously.Of course, ""everything gonna be all right"" and at the end even the animals get the message and team up with humans to eliminate the big bad guy. We are close to almost see Tyrannosaurus Rex giving the thumbs up.And then there was that chick (bimbo) running on high heels in the forest :)",Jurassic World
638,jmanchak6,"A big, dumb, mindlessly entertaining monster movie. Don't expect more",7,14 June 2015,"""Jurassic Park"" is widely regarded as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest achievements, and why shouldn't it be? Groundbreaking special effects, memorable characters, and marvellous direction that interweaves moments of tension, terror, humour and pure spectacle, all within a two-hour frame. The film is given layers from great performances, solid writing, and the previously mentioned masterful direction. But underneath all of these layer, at the film's very core, it's kind of a silly monster movie.""Jurassic World"" completely embraces its silliness, and in an era where most blockbusters take themselves a bit too seriously, this is a refreshing change of pace.Ever since the first trailer dropped, the film has been receiving many premature criticisms. Right off the bat, many scoffed at the idea that anyone would actually try to create a dinosaur theme park with all of the known horrible failures that have occurred in the past. All I can say to that is that if you can't buy the premise, you shouldn't waste your time and money to watch this movie. I know it's tempting to go see a movie that looks dumb, just to have the satisfaction of complaining about it on the internet, but trust me, you'll live a happier life if you just avoid the film altogether (although judging from its historic opening weekend, I'm assuming most of the people reading this review haven't avoided it).Another concept that many had trouble grasping is the idea of Chris Pratt's trained velociraptors. Personally, I thought this was an interesting idea. Many highly intelligent and dangerous animals can be trained by humans (I'm assuming most of you have heard of SeaWorld), so I thought this was an interesting new direction for the franchise's greatest antagonists. Besides, we've seen villainous raptors in all of the previous films, so I had no problem with the filmmakers taking them in this direction. One thing I can say is that the film manages to 'have its cake and eat it too' regarding the raptors.The Indominus Rex was very silly, but worked well as the antagonist for this kind of movie. It was very ""Predator-esque"" (cloaking ability, chase scene through a jungle and down a waterfall, ""It's hunting for sport""), which, as a ""Predator"" fan, I quite enjoyed.In the best that doesn't involve dinosaurs, Henry Wu (BD Wong) and Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) have a heated discussion about the cloning process of the dinosaurs. Wu states that ""nothing in Jurassic World is natural"", and that the dinosaurs they have created are very different from what dinosaurs were really like 65 million years ago. This subtly tackles an issue that the more scientifically savvy fans of the franchise had with this installment. ""Jurassic Park"" created a massive amount of public interest in dinosaurs, so tons of research has been done since 1993. In this research, scientists have discovered that dinosaurs very likely had feathers. Not just the little mohawks they gave the raptors in ""JP3"", but full-on covered in feathers. This one simple line from BD Wong kind of cancels out that entire argument against the film.Now of course, this is no masterpiece. Obviously, this is several notches below the ranks of the original film (did anyone really expect otherwise?). There are MANY straight-up dumb moments that hurt my enjoyment of the film. Mostly stemming from the kids.These kids, man, they were annoying. Surprisingly, the younger one (Ty Simpkins) wasn't too bad. He acted the way I imagine a dinosaur- loving child would act in a theme park full of dinosaurs. But his older brother (Nick Robinson) was just a miserable character. His characteristics include being all mopey and uninterested while he's in the most unbelievably cool place on earth. And... that's pretty much it. Oh, and he's constantly gawking at girls the entire trip, but that running joke(?) ends up going nowhere. I understand that the filmmakers were going for the idea that ""people in this day and age are bored of dinosaurs"" and that Robinson's character is the embodiment of the fictional public's views on dinosaurs. That doesn't make him any less annoying. No offense to the actor, I'm sure he was doing the best with what he was given, but seriously, I really wanted him to get eaten more than any other character (that includes Vincent D'Onofrio's wonderfully slimy performance). I find it hard to root for a character who has (as established in the first scene) a girlfriend, yet is continuously drooling over every female within 100 yards. An minor thing that bothered me was how the kids CONVENIENTLY knew how to fix a jeep that hasn't run in 22 years. A line earlier in the film (rather than right before they start fixing it), establishing that they're good at fixing cars, would've been appreciated. An easy way they could've done this was by showing them get their family's van running in the opening scene. It would've been obvious from that point on that they were eventually going to fix a vehicle at some point, but at least this would've provided some much-needed set-up and payoff.Overall though, the film is a very fun, mindless way to spend two hours. It's funny, I saw a headline for an article saying something along the lines of ""Did Jurassic World get a boost from nostalgia?"". Umm, isn't that obvious. The film preys on your childhood love of the original, but it does it in a fairly classy way. Colin Trevorrow and his team are clearly fans of the original film, and show lots of love for it through various nods. Unlike Michael Bay, whose films suggest he truly hates the audience, Trevorrow was clearly aiming at making an enjoyable movie for the fanbase. And also making a bazillion dollarsCynicism takes a backseat when you're having shameless, nostalgic fun, and when the Tyrannosaurus Rex's iconic roar blasts through the auditorium, it's hard not to become riddled with joy.",Jurassic World

This movie will not illicit the same response from today's children. Spielberg (and his team) broke new ground and painstakingly created new effects that became the standard. This movie uses techniques that already exist and while these effects do look awesome, they're not awe inspiring. The ""spielbergian"" effects aren't the only thing missing, his storytelling style is sorely missed. No time is set setting up characters, situations, or (most importantly) SUSPENSE.Not only is the script, at times, cringe worthy with terrible dialouge, and plot points, but no time is spent setting up these characters. This leads us to really not care about these characters, especially since only 1 of them is even remotely likable, the rest are incredibly ""douchey"". Making matters worse is the atrocious acting from all parties involved (all of them). Pratt is a rehashed yet wooden Star Lord, Howard is her usual C-Word role, the 2 teens are annoying, and D'Onofrio is clearly there for the paycheck. It also must be noted that none of the actors have any chemistry, watching Pratt and Howard together is difficult to say the least.But let's be honest, nobody went to see this for the acting or the plot, they go to see the effects and the dinosaurs. On that front the movie is a success, however 3-D adds very very little to the film. While it doesn't break new ground with revolutionary techniques, it's still the coolest looking dinosaur movie you'll ever see. Despite the myriad of flaws I must say I was highly entertained throughout the entire film, which is really all I can ask of from a movie about a genetically engineered dinosaur theme park.Did it illicit that same childhood wonder and excitement of Jurassic Park in me? Of course not, I'm a grown up now and there's no way the movie could. But it did remind me of a time I felt that way. Will the children of today be as blown away as we were? Probably not, they have much more sophisticated technology in movies now. What we experienced was mind blowingly original, what they experience will not be. But there's nothing wrong with that. Without Spielberg there was never a chance of this topping the original but again it doesn't have to, it just has to top The Lost World and Part 3. And it easily does so, anyone who says it doesn't is probably just holding on to the way the original made them feel. Let's keep in mind that no Jurassic sequel has ever been really good just good for a dinosaur movie.",Jurassic World

A former soldier who now trains dinosaurs facing entrepreneurs who want to use the dinosaurs for military purposes. Obviously, a dinosaur escapes and everybody starts screaming and running. A somewhat empty film. It works only if you feel like disconnecting 2 hours, to hang out. Very little originality, at times looks like a remake of the first film, but it clearly is not, and is far from reaching it. Almost plagiarized scenes (I imagine as a tribute. I did not like it.

It doesn't have much of a plot line other than dinosaurs killing everyone in their path and our heroes trying to save as many people as they can and stop the bloodshed. They picked a good crew for the actors and I enjoyed the banter between them. You have to take a lot for granted in this movie. Throw away common sense before you start watching. If you start asking, ""Why did they do that""? You are doomed. It's a thrill ride, so just buckle up, sit down, and enjoy it. Unlike me, who spent the most part of the movie going, ""ok, that wouldn't happen"", ""stupid humans"", and ""who do they think they are fooling, that would never work"". I saw it first at the movie theater and had issues. My wife hadn't seen it so we rented it for my second viewing.

We went a couple weeks after the movie was released and it was possibly the greatest IMAX experience ever! I loved almost every minute and every second of Jurassic World and although it's not as good as the first Jurassic Park, I think it's equal to The Lost World which I also enjoyed. When we ere sitting in the theatre, I was already hyped when the Universal logo popped up on screen and that may tell you that I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park Franchise and I love all of the movies minus Jurassic Park III which i'm not a huge fan of, but it's ok. And I had a BLAST with Jurassic World and I think the idea of adding the new hybrid The Indominus rex is genius! The story really hooked and caught my attention, the CGI was good enough, but I really think they should've added more animatronics and that would've improved the film because in this movie you will find A LOT of CGI and a very little amount of animatronics. The actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great! They're not as great as Sam Neil or Laura Dern from the first Jurassic Park, but they still are very good actors who play as very interesting characters known as Owen and Claire and their performances are really good in this film as well as the kids who are played by Nick Robinson and Ty Sympkins. Jurassic World really surprised me! In fact, it surprised everyone in my theatre. After the movie was over and the credits were rolling, the audience was clapping and I have NEVER in my life of any movie theatre experienced that kind of feeling and I felt very happy when I left the theatre. Jurassic World is a great sequel even it does not live up to the original,I respect it for what it is and I'm proud to be a fan of this franchise and i'm gonna give Jurassic World a 9.5/10.",Jurassic World
649,iepw12,"Very disappointing, but very well made",5,15 June 2015,"I guess against the grain of consensus opinion, my initial thought leaving this film behind was ,that really was one of the silliest films I have ever seen, but I do often say to friends who want an opinion of a film... well it was complete rubbish but I loved it. Well heres the rub. This film was complete rubbish and I didn't really like it at all mainly because it didn't really entertain me. It was as many have said, utterly predictable and no where near as imaginative as it could have been, given its obvious budget and actually quite good cast, Chris Pratt in particular tried to save it several times being an excellent 'bad ass' heroic type but even he seemed restrained somehow by unimaginative .clichee ridden directing together with what has to be admitted incredible special effects/cgi or whatever we're supposed to call it now. The Dinos definitely weren't real,none were brilliant actors wearing those computer suit things like in Avatar, but there seemed to be a lot of real people in crowd scenes but then they started to be pick off by flying Dinos so I guess they weren't real in all cases. Two big problems.... The story was rather like a worst Dr Who episode rather than an epic film as promised. You could easily have seen it all in half an hour and the best bit of the original series (imo) ie John Williams theme was nearly played about three times and then disappeared after making my senses think oh, now its going to get exciting( ask yourself, what is one of the key continuity aspects of all film franchises;Bond, Star Wars, dare I say Mission Impossible.... its the thematic aspect of the music, so don't play three or four bars as a token gesture , play it all and play it loud and at least the audience can latch on to every second of excitement they've ever felt when they've heard those sounds before even if it ain't really happening before their eyes the rest of their sensibilities will imagine it is because musical memory is a very powerful influence on the emotions. To sum up I believe a successful film will entertain by making me laugh, making me cry, making me wonder whats coming next and making me gaze in wonder at the screen when I get the audio cues to remind me its not reality...... which I've left at home. Didn't get that today , shame as I had expected far more from the trailer.",Jurassic World
650,bethany-lewis,Movie of the year!,10,14 June 2015,"When I sat down in the cinema, I was expecting it to be a typically average sequel to the much-loved original. I was anticipating the odd scare and, admittedly, a lack of plot. I was very wrong. The film topped my expectations - it was a simply fantastic.Firstly, I really do not know why anyone is complaining. The only reason people are naming it ""disappointing"" is because of the first movie (which, remember, is one of the best films of all time). If Jurassic Park had never been made, there wouldn't be a single complaint.The gripping plot is full of thrills, scares, and even the odd laugh. From the very start, you fearfully anticipate what the consequences of engineering the Indominus Rex (the villainous Dino of the film) will be. In addition, although there are moments that reflect what happened in the other movies, the basic plot is original and there are a couple of surprising twists along the way. The special effects are brilliant. The dinosaurs were so convincing that I actually believed the were real, which only added to the tension I experienced from beginning to end. Although, apparently, not all the dinosaurs represent what they were actually like (the Raptors, apparently, had feathers on them - an image that would not be very scary) there is a reasonable yet non-confusing amount of science discussed in the film.The acting is also top-class. Ty Simpkins and Chris Pratt in particular give very convincing performances. During the movie, you also gain a developed understanding in the personalities of the characters, which is something most action movies lack. For people and humans alike, we get an insight into either their vicious or caring characteristics.I would highly recommend this film to anyone (although the movie may not be suitable for anyone younger than 9 or 10). And, with the greatest respect to people criticising the film, nobody should listen to them. Sadly, some people are never pleased.",Jurassic World

I thought the idea of commercialism and ethics could have and should have been explored better. A character talks about never being able to match the first part which is true.

652,reviewsbycaleb,Heavy Hands Produce Cash,5,30 June 2015,"Jurassic Park has been a box office phenom and surprise, which for me this summer has not always translate into me enjoying that film (specifically thinking of Furious 7). I am a big fan of Chris Pratt and enjoyed the original Jurassic Park when I revisited it last year. There were mixed expectations coming in with many friends telling me they really enjoyed it and many critics I know or follow being not so thrilled about the new Jurassic Park (World) reboot. What would this relatively unknown and new director (Colin Trevorrow) come up with? In the fourth installment of this prehistorically new world, it picks up 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park (1993). Jurassic World follows many characters, and two of those characters are brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell (Zach Robinson and Ty Simpkins) who get sent off to the theme park by their parents. Right after the two kids are out of hearing range, it is apparent that their is high tension between the grown ups and it is later revealed they are in the process of getting a divorce. This is my first problem with the movie, this side story line is solely their to raise the stakes for the audience in these two kids, and it is done in such a blatant and uncreative way. This is an ongoing theme throughout the film and a huge problem with the writing. On the other end of the plane is Zach and Gray's aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who runs the whole park. She is clearly a driven and work focused women who hasn't seen her nephew's in over 7 years. The boys are clearly disappointed when she is taken away on business and leaves an assistant to show the boys around the park. The business is a new attraction to revive the theme park and boost attendance. It is learned that this new ""asset"" is a genetically enhanced super dinosaur, and the billionaire owner Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) wants to make sure the dinosaur is safe enough to open up to the public. This is when the one and only Chris Pratt, playing Owen, finally comes in. I am a big fan of Chris Pratt for my favorite movie in many years The Lego Movie, and the very solid Guardians of the Galaxy.He was a moderate bright spot in this movie and was a good fit for the role, while not blowing me away as he did in the previous two films mentioned. Owen, being a Velociraptor trainer has considerable skills in this field but him and two others are tricked by the dinosaur and the other two characters pay the ultimate price and all hell is broke lose when the dinosaur escapes.In the escape of these many prehistoric animals there is a mad dash by the characters to control or eliminate the outbreak, and specifically the super dinosaur who caused it all. In this chaos Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), the head of security on the Island, wants to use the Velociraptors and his men to eliminate the problems, and him and Pratt's character clash drastically. In the first attempt to take down this creature it is CLEARLY noticed that he has camouflage capabilities when the leader of the hunt party yells out ""HE HAS CAMOUFLAGE"" before being eaten. This provides two problems for me with Jurassic World; first being the heavy handed writing and unbelievable lines delivered by characters. There is no way that character would yell that right before his ultimate demise, and we don't need to be clearly told the dinosaur has this ability because we can see that for ourselves. Second problem is my biggest problem with this movie, and it is the lack of care for the human characters deaths but a huge sentiment when one of the animals or dinosaurs is killed or hurt, it is like PETA made this movie. Can't really get into it anymore without spoilers but look for it when you see the movie, all the dramatic heft is for the hurting or deceased animals which is fine, but there is almost a disdain towards humans in this movie. I loved Marley & Me and it brought me to tears, so don't freak out that I hate animals, but when there are people dying all around and there is no care in that, but a clear dramatic focus on these genetically modified animals, we have a problem. On that note, this is a moderately violent and scary movie so young kids may be frightened. Jurassic World suffers from a heavy handed script, and an even more heavy handed animal activist agenda. There are significant thrills in this movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed, but in the end is a forgettable disappointment despite it fattening the wallets of studio executives.Check out all my reviews: https://reviewsbycaleb.com/",Jurassic World
653,monakazu,Reality,8,26 July 2016,"I don't know Jurassic park which is the first movie of this series, but I can enjoy watching it. The genre is kind of fantasy, but there are also horror elements in this movie. At first, Jurassic world give people dreams and fun. But one accident happened and situation changes from peace to dangerous dramatically. A lot of people are killed, and those scene is hard to watch for me, but I like the reality of this movie. Human dreams to control dinosaurs and get the technology to do it. However, in the last everyone realize that human and dinosaurs cannot live together. While the story is going there are friendship between human and dinosaurs, but everything is changed at the last of the movie. I think that is so real. This movie tells us the story with reality, but also tells us friendship and love, so I like this movie.",Jurassic World

655,Bobster36,Passable but not much more.,5,22 October 2015,"The usual, tired Jurassic formula of kids in jeopardy from dinosaurs and the grownups trying to save them and everyone else while some bad guy interferes. Chris Pratt is likable but one dimensional. He's the tough, fearless, no-nonsense hero throughout the film and we know little else about him. Vincent D'Onofrio, usually a very good actor, seems to be channeling Brian Dennehy as the predicable, one dimensional villain making a bad situation worse. Bryce Dallas Howard has the best part as a career company shill for JW, who never even got to know her nephews but must now risk her life to save them at the expense of the park she was so devoted to. The movie is pretty much non-stop dinosaurs fighting people and each other. With modern special effects being what they are these days, even that is becoming routine and not enough to save the stale story line. The movie can be mindless fun but nothing more.",Jurassic World
656,bsvends1,Great entertainment,7,15 June 2015,"If you like the Jurassic movies, you won't be disappointed, as long as you don't expect too much character depth or clever story line. Yes, the characters are a bit one dimensional and the story.., well, it is what it is.The animation and special effects are very good. You believe the animals are alive, and one scene in particular may even bring out a tear or two.For the very young audiences, the movie might be a bit intense, but I don't think it would serve the movie right to tone down the creature violence. If you have a flesh-eating dinosaur running after you, you'll probably going to get eaten!Despite the clichés and the fact that it can't touch the original, my friends and I had a very good time watching Jurassic World.

657,hoffaleksander,"Fun, but completely misses the point",2,3 February 2016,"Spoiler alert people! Yes, dinosaurs are finally back! However, Jurassic World completely misses the point. Why did we all love the old movies? They were mysterious, a bit scary and we knew the dinosaurs do not at any point have ""feelings"" in the same term as a human. At the end, when the giant modified dinosaur dies, the T-Rex just looks at his human companions.. as if they are friends now, and he did them a big favor. Let us now just run along and be happy we are both alive, I won't eat you. Why? The movie is supposed to be brutal, and scary, but at the same time have an adventurous feeling to it. I almost.. just almost.. think this movie was as terrible as the third one. And by the way.. bring back Jeff, at least he made the movies funny by thinking what we were all thinking... ""you idiots, why did you ever decide to create a living dinosaur that can eat you?!"". I miss the times when Steven Spielberg would direct movies like this.. at least he knew what the audience wants. The next time I will wait until at least a few weeks to see if I am even going to approach this series of movies again. The only highlight was Chris Pratt.. at least he had a nice role to play, and his acting is good.. same with that woman I completely forgot who was, her acting was good, her role sucked.",Jurassic World
658,irrelevantlife,Jurassic Comedy,3,17 June 2015,"Where to begin in describing this train wreck of a Jurassic Park movie? Let's start with the obvious, lackluster characterizations. Jurassic World reintroduces the character of Dr. Henry Wu, played by veteran actor BD Wong, and his appearance brought a smile to my face, only to be wiped off by his complete lack of conviction, the character is used for about 3 minutes and left out in favor of the rest of the cast.What we are given here are flat characters with minimal material to work with, Howard is almost completely void of conviction and looks like a robot with high heels, her supposed connection to her nephews (the two boys) is shoe horned for dramatic effect, but the performance given by Robinson and Simpkins are so mundane and heartless you are left wishing they get killed and eaten by the antagonist Indominus-Rex, so their miserable existence has a meaningful ending. At a chase the two boys are forced to jump down a waterfall to escape the I-Rex, their expression and complete lack of tension reveals the green screen they were facing at that day of filming, absolutely no emotion whatsoever is conveyed by these two. For all I care they could have been chased by a chicken, because that is the reaction they were conveying in the movie. But I must digress, as we move forward the film presents us with D'Onofrio's character, an idiot planning to use raptors as bio weapons, the absurdity in the notion alone is cringe worthy, but is topped off when this moron starts to argument for why it would work, I found myself laughing out loud in the theater as this was pure comedic gold, although not intentional, I am sure. This movie has more stupidity than all the previous 3 movies combined, to progress the incredibly shallow storyline some characters must behave as complete idiots, enter Simon Masrani (head of the park) played by Irrfan Khan who changes character when the script demands of him. Masrani is introduced as a sensible leader, who looks after the guest and dinosaurs alike, yet when faced to destroy the I-Rex he refuses to give the order due to the high costs associated with making this hybrid dinosaur, this of course at the expense of human lives who are sent in for a slaughter. But it doesn't end there, Masrani has just learned how to fly helicopters and is seen partaking in an attempt to kill the I-Rex. Let me repeat, a newly certified amateur helicopter pilot with zero experience as a combat pilot flies a helicopter full of armed guards and a mini-gun mounted, he then jokingly says to his employees ""This is like having a general fly his soldiers into battle"", the sheer nonsense at display was painful to endure. Of course, this buffoon loses control of the helicopter and crashes it into a dome releasing hundreds of flying prehistoric animals who conveniently all fly directly to the human populated area of the island.To a point the CGI is handled respectively on the main antagonist the I-Rex, the raptors on the other hand look cheap and so does the iconic T-Rex at the end of the movie, its as if they ran out of time or money to polish the rest of the prehistoric cast.And let me tell you is the final fight a bore, not because the entire movie was trash, but because Trevorrow and his team managed to destroy the iconic T-Rex once and for all. The T-Rex is portrayed horribly, the way it moves and the way it looks differs so strongly, from what we have come to expect in the Jurassic Park series that is downright insulting. This T-Rex does not even have the same appearance as the ones seen in the last three films; it looks flat, broken and its animation clunky. The final fight looked like two rubber dinosaurs where hammering each other, their necks lose as if they were dolls, the short Jurassic Park 3 battle between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus was a masterpiece compared to this. In Jurassic Comedy the T-Rex's head swung around like it was in a spasm, the flips these dinosaurs do are reserved for fighting video games, not an ounce of authenticity was portrayed during the final battle sequence. Trevorrow tries so hard to please with the T-Rex smashing through a Spinosaurus skeleton, as if it were some idiotic form of poetic justice looking back to Jurassic Park 3. There is really nothing positive I can say that could lift this movie the abyss it has fallen into. The only thing that works in the movie are the scenes with the I-Rex hunting down and killing guards, those scenes have a sense of tension and originality due to the I-Rex being a completely different beast than the rest, but when the movie tries to be a Jurassic Park movie if falls flat in almost every occasion.Not even Pratt with his playful grin and uplifting action scenes can save this pile of Dino dung from being completely inferior to the other three films in the series. The Lost World may have had very questionable morale that prioritizes dinosaurs over humans and some plot holes but it was 10x the fun and thrill of Jurassic Comedy, and Jurassic Park 3 for all its goofy moments and simple concept was still true to its roots and presented a believable adventure with characters you grew to like. This is just a Jurrasic Cash Grab with no soul it exists purely to capitalize on the name of the franchise, and it has succeeded, but its box office does not reflect the movies qualities. As I left the theater, I saw many who were gazing at the floor they knew they had just seen the rape of a once great movie franchise.",Jurassic World
659,michaelsharples96,"There's dinosaurs, people get eaten. It's a pretty good time at the cinema",4,19 June 2015,"22 years later and the park is open and is fully operational. Every time they've unveiled a new attraction attention has spiked. But for the past few years it's been slowly declining. People just aren't fascinated by dinosaurs anymore. So, they decide to make a new one. Cooler, deadlier and bigger than any dinosaur to walk this earth. Pretty much THE definition of Murphy's Law.""Corporate felt genetic modification would up the 'wow' factor.""""They're dinosaurs, 'WOW' enough.""I put that quote in there as I believe if there was ever a line within a movie that perfectly explained how idiotic and unbelievable the films plot will be. That's probably it. Now I don't l know about anyone else, but I can guarantee you I would never get bored of seeing a T- Rex. I don't believe for a single second that people would lose interest in that. There are movies I can watch over and over again and never get bored of. So I can promise you if there was a way I could see an alive and breathing T-Rex. I would see that every single day.What is Jurassic World? It's intense, it's suspenseful but above all else, it's REALLY fun. On sheer entertainment value it's one of the best I've seen so far this year. Behind Mad Max and Kingsman. Even though it's not human the Indominous Rex is one of my favorite movie characters so far this year. That thing was Super cool. She ate a ton of people, violently might I add, this movie was extremely graphic for a PG-13. She was deadly (Obviously, i mean it's a dinosaur), smart and really coolThat brings me to my second point. The I-Rex was written better than 80% of the characters in this film. You've got kind of a sub-villain who is basically a cartoon of every person in a movie who wants to take something and use it as a weapon. He basically wants to take the Raptors you see Pratt training in the trailer and use them for war. Which if you ask me is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. There is no logical scenario I can think of where that doesn't end badly for you.I wasn't a huge fan of the humour. I'm probably in the minority but I didn't like Jake Johnson's character. Like, at all. The only reason he's there is to add comedic relief. The only problem was I didn't find him at all funny. I didn't laugh at any of his lines. The all felt forced like they were just trying to lighten the mood, but failing. They were just snide comments like that one kid in school who always argues with and talks back to the teacher just to get some social recognition. He was a completely pointless additional character IMO, the movie would have played out exactly the same without him.The scene from the trailer where we see Owen slide under the truck was kind of like the kitchen scene of Jurassic Park, just not as good IMO. It was suspenseful, heart pounding and it showed the intelligence of his character, because we don't want dumb characters in a movie like this. Well, we don't want TOO many of them. Every time the I-Rex was on screen I was glued to it, you could not divert my attention if you was on fire. I was kind of worried that we see too much of her and the suspense wouldn't be there. The most memorable part of the original is that we didn't see the T-Rex until 50 minutes in, which built the tension, built the suspense. But what this movie does is utilize the characters in such a way that you feel like you're stuck in the situation with them and THAT gave us that tension. That fear. I just feel the original did it better. But then again, comparing this to the original is just inane, I mean it was Steven Spielberg.I don't know if it's just the scripts that are written for him or the kid himself, but I really don't like Ty Simpkin as an actor. I didn't like him in Insidious, I didn't like him in Iron Man 3 and I don't like him in this. He just bugs me. He's basically a packed sandwich and every character he plays is just adding an extra slice of annoyance after each movie. His character was there for no other reasons other than to be saved and add pointless subplots, same with his on screen brother. They were in the movie just to be put in danger so Pratt and Bryce would have a reason to risk there lives. Just to add a certain amount of emotion, but i didn't feel the emotion. The characters weren't written well enough.Owen (Chris Pratt) however was great, other than the dinosaurs he was my favorite part of the movie. He was the only one who really had any intelligence. If i'm completely honest, he was really the only interesting human character. I would go as far to say he was kind of a Jeff Goldblum homage. He spoke like Ian Malcolm did, he had the great charisma as Ian Malcolm did. He acknowledge how bad of an idea creating a Dinosaur is (Which to be honest. Shouldn't everyone?) just like Malcolm did. The movie is self aware of the original but I think it beats you over the head with it until you get the message.In a movie like this I don't really care if it's predictable, i don't care if it's not the most cohesive story ever written. That's not what i'm going into this movie for. I'm here to see gargantuan dinosaurs and watch people get eaten. And on that note the movie more than delivers. If you go into this expecting award winning story telling, You'll be disappointed.",Jurassic World
660,gmd4462-623-52926,Jurassic Ripoff,5,27 June 2015,"Like the dinosaurs that inspired it, this series should have stayed extinct. There's nothing new here, nothing remotely interesting, unless you just paid to see dinosaurs eating people and wrecking stuff, in which case you'll get your money's worth. It's like Spielberg is just ripping off himself now, same big brass music, same stock characters (Chris Pratt only needs a whip and a hat to make the transformation to Indiana Jones complete), the bratty yet super smart and noble kids, the driven mother figures, the megalomaniac billionaire and the usual Spielberg villain: The Military Industrial Complex. The writing team (which includes Michael Crichton, who's been dead for years) seems to have spent around 5 minutes on the script. It's a rehash of bad jokes and cornball clichés. I guess they figured their target audience (11 year olds?) could care less. Even Chris Pratt can't save this movie from itself--he barely cracks a smile. He looks as miserable I felt watching it. Nowhere is it explained that, with three previous attempts at a dinosaur theme park being unmitigated disasters, who was it who actually wanted another one with even bigger, deadlier monsters and ""more teeth?"" Are we consumers really that masochistic? If Disney World had such a high death toll, would they be building MORE parks just like it?Save your money. Stay home and watch the original. Still the best and most thrilling. Back when Spielberg thought the story was as important as the special effects.",Jurassic World
661,mcgregorrowland,Good but a few things that held it back from being amazing,7,12 June 2015,"Don't get me wrong, this movie was still really good for many reasons. The acting was awesome, the CGI was incredible, and the action and adventure of the movie was pretty awesome too. Chris Pratt communicating with the raptors was really cool. The shark dino was amazing along with many of the other dinosaurs in the movie. The plot and the conflict of the movie was very good. And Jurassic World itself in the movie was really cool to watch and you really felt like you wanted to go there when watching all the cool stuff they thought of. But there was a few things that held it back.There was some really cheesy scenes involving romance, the side story of some of the characters, and the overall emotions of some of the characters. It just felt so bad to have that in the movie.The end ""battle scene"" did not satisfy me. I don't want to tell you what happens but it just was not amazing like it should have been and it was too short to give me that awesome feeling.So overall this was a really good adventure/action movie with a couple of things that might upset you but other than that it was a great movie that you will enjoy watching.",Jurassic World

There were 3 main points that i was expecting to see:1. Bigger amount of Dinosaurs 2. Some sort of horror elements / tension building 3. ReferencesThese were the major priorities (for me) and all of them were delivered, but in the end something was missing. The first Jurassic Park had a special power, it's simple existence made it more than just another blockbuster. It was made with passion and commitment in an era where profit was not THE major priority. This movie is a good blockbuster with dinosaurs, but it isn't really worthy of the ""Jurassic"" name. If i have to sum up my thoughts about Jurassic World in one sentence, i would say : It could not grab me and drag into it's own world.Visually Jurassic World is good, but nothing more. High quality and detailed special effects became basic requirements in the 21st century (especially in a blockbuster like this). The low use of practical effects can be felt and CGI clearly dominated most of the scenes.The story from the early trailer seemed to be unimaginative and weak. However, if we examine today's demanding society and the expectations of 21st century we may see the reason and purpose behind the decision of creating a completely new dinosaur. The plot is not revolutionary, but it is still way better than the previous ones.Some sort of moral message was brought back (about the ""God complex"" scientists), but the incredibly annoying characters (exception: Chris Pratt) were not capable of engaging in an interesting discussion. Example: In the first Jurassic Park there was a ""lunch scene"" where characters had a chance to mull over and argue about the resurrection of dinosaurs. This was a perfect environment for topics like: scientists who want to play God again, what the nature sentenced to extinction should not be bothered, Is it possible for mankind to live with nature peacefully? etc. In this case, there are plenty of characters to represent each side, but most of the dialogs are weightless and pointless.The whole ""world"" title is well deserved. Many things were actually presented to the audience which helped me to feel that this facility runs effectively more than a decade and everything has an own function and a purpose. Another good point was the interactive games for kids which is an effective teaching method. The creative use of holograms added some futuristic, high-tech feeling and i really liked the idea of gyrosphere which allowed the visitors to take a closer look. By the way, it is completely nonsense if we are talking about security.There were plenty of references and thankfully they were not too direct. Horror elements appeared more than once and this added some extra value to the overall. The only small disadvantage was the lack of bad weather. Here's the thing: In the first movie the T-Rex scene worked so well because every small detail were there to build up the tension and the weather was a main element as well. Raining, thunder, lightning, all these elements visually helped the thrill to culminate.The weakest point of the movie is the characters. The only positive exception was Chris Pratt. After Guardians Of The Galaxy his career started to rise and these types of roles suit him very well. In the beginning, Claire tried to represent a strong, independent woman, but after 30 minutes she completely turned into a shaky bush. Seriously, she was trembling all the time, even in situations where she was pretty far from any danger. I guess, she tried to show the power of fear, but she didn't know how to do it genuinely. Not even mentioning the high heels... Kids were even worse. The younger brother (at least) tried to show some spark of interest, but the older one was clearly a disaster. He was staring at girls and did nothing. It happened not even once! What the hell were those moments?! Why? It was a completely unreasonable and unnecessary move. Irrfan Khan who played the owner tried to be similar to John Hammond, but he couldn't handle this job well.Retracing the footsteps of the ""big brother"" is always a huge task. We might have had too high expectations. We wanted to see something new and something similar at the same time. I can not blame Colin Trevorrow, he had a very tough mission and he really tried to meet the demands of the fans. All in all, this is a good movie to watch. Unfortunately, those who have seen the first groundbreaking movie this is just a hard-working attempt which won't be another milestone in the Jurassic Park universe.",Jurassic World
663,sgholbrook,"""For the Old and the New""",9,16 June 2015,"I have seen bits and bobs of the first few films, so this was basically a new experience for me ! I thought the film was done really well and definitely breached the 12A certificate, the kids sat in front of me were at one point sat on their dads laps ! It is kind of bloody, loud and ""scary"" for the younger audience, but for the older ones that made it even better ! The CGI looked incredible and the story included lots of different aspects of this new park along with some old references to the ones before which are nice touches for big fans of the franchise (because even I noticed them). The only problem I had was that very little was left to surprise because, as well as the trailer did at making people want to go see it, you might as well walk in in the last 20 minutes and then you'll have all the new clips you haven't seen before ! The whole hybrid creating of dinosaurs was a nice aspect revealing a whole new level of terror in the creatures of the film as you don't know what they have used to create the Idominous Rex (and are eager to find out as you see it use more and more abilities you didn't know it had) This film is a definite watch for old or new fans of the series, and definitely wasn't a let down. Go see it !",Jurassic World
664,heartmak,Watch it if Dinosaur's fascinate you...,6,12 June 2015,"When you hear the word Jurassic first things comes in mind are Dinosaur's and Steven Spielberg. Jurassic World is not the continuation of the previous movies however the concept mainly roams around the having a dinosaur into existence in todays life. In Jurassic world you will see not only the renowned Dinosaur's but also the hybrids created by humans. The movie is mostly predictable but what keeps you hooked to it is the little jokes in movie which happen in the middle of action and serious situations. The middle portion of the movie runs pretty slow but same is compensated with surprises. Actress Bryce Dallas Howard has given a very good performance in the movie, even act Irrfan khan has acted well no doubt why he has been frequently seen the Hollywood movies. Actor Chris Pratt has been as usual the naturally humorous person in the movie whereas the kicks of humour are being given actor Jake Johnson. When it comes to movie on dinosaur's T-Rex has to be in it no doubt why he was called the Alpha of Dinosaurs. Dinosaur's where extinct at once so that humans can survive, you will totally believe it if see this movie.On the whole if you have seen any of the Dinosaur's Movie and you liked it then go for it.",Jurassic World

Jurassic World is now one of my favorite movies of all time. The action sequences are intense and plentiful. The special effects are top notch. The music is wonderful(and not just John William's famous themes; Michael Giacchino's score is excellent as well.) And while the characters may not be as developed as in the original Jurassic Park, they are interesting in their own right. Chris Pratt does a great job as Owen, the raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard does excellent as Claire, the head of the park. One of my favorite ""characters"" though is the underwater dinosaur Mosasaur. (Every time it jumps out of the pool it's freaking awesome!) Even though a lot of people have called this movie predictable, it had a lot of twists and turns that were surprising, especially the ending. Without spoiling it, the ending sequence is one of the most epic endings that I can remember in any movie. The ending will give any true Jurassic Park fan chills.",Jurassic World

If your a fan of Jurassic park I guess you might still like the original one better but this film you should watch because it was amazing so fans of Jurassic park series go watch this movie buy the 3d bluray DVD and if your kid wants to watch Jurassic world I say no they can watch it when they're old enough like 11 or 10 because they can watch inside out too.",Jurassic World
667,flavia_cj,A epic adventure to entertain the whole family,10,16 May 2016,"Honestly, I don't understand the negative reviews of this film which criticize the development of character or shallow story. In a film of this genre, it's clear that we will not watch a deep and philosophycal history. Of course the characters will be more simple and one- dimensional. Jurassic World just fulfills what promised: pure entertainment with impressive special effects, great adventure with some scary moments, and a lot of badass dinosaurs. That's what I expect in a movie like this.Of course this movie not have the novelty of the first, but is a worthy sequel. It's remarkable that the story is concerned to honor several times the old island of Spielberg, through dialogues characters or moments in plot. Jurassic World maintain the essence of the first film, but with a story adapted to the new generation. While Jurassic Park is the face of the 90s, Jurassic World is the face of the present day, with a dinosaur park more advanced in technology, more large, open and with a more intimate interaction with the public. The plot is similar to the first: starting slowly introducing the characters, but then things get real bad and chaos ensues, caused by human greed once again, but this time with much larger proportions. How could it be in a movie where dinosaurs are on the loose, many people are devoured - of all deaths, however, I could not fail to mention the Zara's death, which was so impactful and memorable as were the deaths of Dennis Nedry and the guy in the toilet. And the ending of Jurassic World was a gift to any dinosaurs fan, with a epic battle of four titans, which closes the story with great dignity.It's a film for the whole family. Although the story has deaths and scary moments, there is no exaggeration of blood or explicit sexual scenes, so I think that children can watch this.",Jurassic World

The price was $15, the theater was maybe some 75% full, it was a 3:30pm showing, I chose the center isle with the walk way. The screen wasn't as big as the one on 34st, which is disappointing.The biggest sin that a movie could commit is bore me, and boy was I bored by 'Jurassic World'. Haven't we just seen monsters battle each other last year in 'Godzilla'? Ironically, right after returning home from the movies, I turned on HBO and it was on!I thought 'Jurassic World' would be a re-boot, pretending the original movies did not exist and just start all over again; but, nope, it was some yet another re-built park with better tech. Oh, yes, the movie did have some fancy gee-weez CGI, fx, graphics, tech, or whatever else you wish to call a movie that has style over substance and a plot. As for the plot, well, parents send their kids to a dino park, where as if right on cue, a dino goes nuts, escapes, and starts killing. I got a feeling that we've seen this all before many times. The bad dino in fact never existed but is a fake genetic splice, so it has long arms and some mutations. I reckon if dinos could be made for zoos and parks why not splice apes&humans to make soldiers or slave servants to do dirty work like construction?! Oh, because we'll get another 'Planet of the Apes' sequel.I could not understand a word that Arab fellow said, in fact I gave up on following any dialogue and just watched the fights. At the end the movie got lots of applause, and from me as well which is rare, not because it was really good, but because the fx were.",Jurassic World

671,Stskyshaker,"Uninspired, Underutilized and Unnecessary",5,14 June 2015,"Went to the premiere at midnight with big expectations but was summarily disappointed. Starting with the very first scene, honestly, it struck me as a movie with no ambition. Yes the visual effects were pretty good. But it was apparent that director Trevorrow was perfectly content with making something that was forgettable, mediocre yet still capable of making some good money. I think he accomplished that.The whole 2 hours were just extremely uninspired. It felt like they didn't decide to make the movie because they had an idea or a story, but because they found the money. It was scattered with clever cinematic tricks here and there but not with any coherence.Jurassic World was supported by a solid cast but their talents were hampered by uninspired storytelling. There were also too many characters for any of them really to have enough screen time to not be one-dimensional. Irrfan Khan and Omar Sy in particular had so much more to offer. So goes for the film scoring talent of Michael Giacchino. Many times I found myself wishing it simply had used the same music from the original Jurassic Park done by John Williams.Lastly, the title is very misleading. There is little about it that goes beyond the island although that seems to be what Jurassic WORLD implies. All in all an unnecessary addition to the franchise, well to the fans at least.",Jurassic World
672,n-tune1234,Best it could have been,10,14 June 2015,Now to start off I'm a massive fan of the Jurassic park franchise and have enjoyed all three instalments in the franchise.So obviously I have been waiting for this movie for a long time and the question is did it disappoint. Well no this movie was absolutely brilliant for what is was a monster movie. Now this one has lots of nods to the original so if your a fan of the first your gonna love those.However is the movie perfect...no that's because there are characters that felt a little too cartoonish to be real and the movie does have a slow introduction to Chris Pratt's character but once he comes in the movie gets quite interesting.The movie also feels as though it is remaking the first two films with some scenes that were clearly put in the movie because it worked great in the first two.All in all you come to this movie expecting dinosaurs wreaking havoc amongst the island and that's exactly what you get and it pays off as a great entry into the franchise and leaves you wanting more (sequel maybe).,Jurassic World
673,FilmFestAsh,The new generation will be just as thrilled and enraptured as original fans,9,7 August 2019,"The horrifying events on Isla Nebula have been forgotten and Jurassic Park has reopened as Jurassic World. But the public's waning interest sees the park's scientists (still headed up by BD Wong!) go to questionable lengths to keep them entertained - a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur bigger and more deadly than anything the park has handled before.It's hard to believe this is the director's second only feature length film and you can see why Steven Spielberg selected him personally. It's as though you're on a theme park ride for the full two hours, which goes by in a flash of teeth, technology and rain soaked forages through the undergrowth.Chris Pratt is intensely likeable as the rebooted Sam Neill of the piece, connecting audiences to the new story's backbone, the struggle to help the paying public (and the park's investors) understand that these once mythological creatures, now relegated to ordinary zoo attractions, are real animals in need of proper care and capable of heinous acts if they don't receive that care.Jurassic World is a 21st century big budget family action film to rival the best.
The new generation will be just as thrilled and enraptured as original fans were more than 20 years ago and us originals will appreciate the return of John Williams' theme and the raptors as the stars of the show.",Jurassic World
674,janvl0412,"Some great concepts, a nice budget, but poor execution",6,11 June 2015,"Whilst I loved the first two Jurassic Park movies and enjoyed the third, this one felt a bit lacking. We went to see this movie in the latest state of the art theater, laser 3d blabla and in my opinion (and let me put that disclaimer for everything following) they took a great franchise, copy pasted some great things, threw money at it, but forgot the soul, accelerations, thrills and storytelling so greatly mastered by Spielberg. For the positive: - The actors: great casting, I love all of those involved. - The effects: well done indeed. - The new park: breathtaking and quite original at times. - The action: one scene stood out: the one where Chris Pratt joins the raptors on a chase. Great stuff. The negative: - The director, for not utilizing his cast better. Jokes that fall flat or don't get that punchline to where it could've gone. There were some giggles, but with better direction they could've easily had us in stitches. Especially knowing the potential, again, of the cast. The rhythm is also far from as good as the first ones. Now I'm going to be a bit rude and blame a lot on the director, again, just my opinion. Each character's storyline and personality was underdeveloped despite of the aforementioned potential. Story lines are thrown out, left unresolved or lacked closure in a way that wasn't Lost on me. Just ridiculous: - First of all the advertising. I mean are you kidding me. I've just paid a(n un)fair amount on tickets (see comments below about the 3D), the way product-placement was handled here was unsubtle, to say the least. There's some commercials shamelessly woven into the movie. - Some of the action: I'll avoid spoilers, but when you'll see it, I think you'll know what I'm referring to. - Some of those flying dinosaurs. They looked like characters out of the Smurfs to me. - The whole storyline of (again avoiding spoilers) what they use raptors for. - Sound-effects on the raptors. In the end yes, they've managed to add a new scary monster, and it worked out better than anticipated. But in the process they've reduced the feared raptors to lapdogs (in more ways than one) and removed a lot of the threat of the T- rex. Now we went to see it in Laser 3D like I mentioned, but to be honest, the movie was produced in 2013, and I doubt at that time any of this technology was available, because I've seen 3D's in less equipped theaters that blew me away, e.g. the latest X-men, and this one, I really didn't find anything special about it. Also, the score is so underutilized. So if I'm so negative about this one, why did I give it a 6? Because I do want to see a next one and hope they salvage the franchise by steering firmly to the left from this one. And visually the park is great.",Jurassic World
675,mmjnr10,Best Jurassic Park Ever Made and Best 2015 Blockbuster Hands Down!!,10,23 June 2015,I'm so angry Extremely angry at those comments which undermined that great movie to the extent that after reading the reviews here I felt so much this movie will turn up to be a let down and was about to skip it!! The only reason I went to see it after reading those reviews which all pointed that its not all that also said not bad yet not great was that I had nothing else better to do that evening!! and Boy was I so wrong!!!! Seriously at least 70% of the comments out here are so damn faithful to Jurassic 1&2 to the extent they became blinded to anything that could actually be better!! And to be fair to those who dissed this movie they all pointed out that it is better than the 3rd installment which to me meant nothing much because Part 3 was a total waste of time and anything compared to it will be better!! Therefor I seriously considered waiting for it to come on DVD instead of wasting valuable time driving down to me local IMAX to watch it!! Well I went with almost zero expectations which is not good in my case because it makes me see the worst in a movie instead of being optimistic and boy that movie rocked me side way upwards downwards you name it and the strength ultimately came from the amazing extra ordinary story line and the effects combined with some amazing direction and camera work that blow me away!! I immediately went down to memory lane to remind myself how good really Jurassic Park 1&2 actually were?!!However I could not help myself thinking this story line and movie all together is actually better way better than the original Jurassic Park and the reason for this is that this movie is more serious you may say and darker than the first two with a solid captivating story line that I would expect would catch the attention of almost anyone serious about movies. I consider myself one of the world's best movie watchers and if there was an award I would surely run for it because I have seen almost every decent movie that has come out from 1965 till now with a few exceptional ones beyond those dates!! That doesn't mean that my taste in movies would appeal to everyone nor it means I know better than the rest of you may be just a little bit!!!! This movie is world class and by far the best Blockbuster of 2015 Hands both Down!! Go watch it folks and be fair when you rate a movie,Jurassic World
676,just_for_movies,"A fun movie, but has a few downfalls",7,16 July 2015,"Jurassic World is the newest addition to the Jurassic Park franchise (4th movie). To be honest, I have not seen any of the previous installments of the Jurassic Park franchise because I was never interested in dinosaurs (not even as a kid). I went and saw this movie primarily because I thought it looked more like a modern action movie and less of a dinosaur movie. That was certainly a wrong assumption on my behalf because it is wholeheartedly a dinosaur flick. I still had fun with it but not as much as I had hoped.The action is absolutely my favorite part of this movie. It's not that kind of exhilarating and intense action that one would find in Kingman: The Secret Service; rather, it is fun, dumb action that one would just enjoy while munching on some buttery popcorn. I found the action very entertaining especially in the second act. There isn't much action in the first act and I had some problems with the third act. The third act mostly focuses on the dinosaurs and there is a lot of action with just the dinosaurs. No big spoilers but at the end there is literally a dinosaur fist fight between these two huge dinosaurs. It was even choreographed like a human fist fight so it looked really odd when dinosaurs were doing it. I disliked the third act because it focused a lot on the dinosaurs combat and seeing that I'm not interested in dinosaurs, that got almost boring for me. The second act had some awesome action though which I enjoyed immensely.The story/plot in Jurassic World is decent. For the most part, it's easy to understand and there aren't too many plot holes. Yet some of the plot points are a little muggy and not fleshed out well enough. The pacing in this movie was absolutely fine and character development was generally good as well. Speaking of characters, these characters were so darn clichéd that it was laughable. Bryce Dallas Howard played the usual uptight business woman, Chris Pratt played the scruffy, stubborn adventure type guy, and Vincent D'Onofrio played the stupid military dude who wants to use everything as a weapon (like dinosaurs). All these characters were extremely clichéd which was kind of off-putting to me. Also, probably the biggest issue this film has is the dialogue. Holy moly it is cheesy! Almost every other spoken line is a one-liner cheese-fest! The cheesy-ness is cringeworthy that's how bad it is. The writers could have tried a little harder right?Finally, the acting in this movie is really good given the amount of cheesy dialogue and everyones characters being clichéd. Chris Pratt is one fine actor and he did well in his role. Bryce Dallas Howard was good in her role especially at the end. The rest of the cast was just as good and really surprised me.In the end, Jurassic World had fun action and great acting. On the downside, it had a relatively weak story/plot, unbelievably clichéd characters, and laughably bad dialogue. I had fun with this movie but many things could have been improved. Like I said before, I'm not much of a dinosaur fan but I still gave this movie a chance thinking it was not heavily oriented towards dinosaurs. I was wrong which slightly disappointed me but I still had good fun with Jurassic World.",Jurassic World
677,glennmeerten06,JP3 has been redeemed!,8,14 June 2015,"I wasn't expecting this sequel to the 2001 train wreck that was Jurassic Park 3. My expectations weren't high but they weren't low either. The movie opens in true JP style with an egg that's hatching. Right away I was back in that same 7 year old mindset back when I first watched Jurassic Park. Jurassic World is the park that John Hammond wished he got to see but never saw realized. It looks amazing, like Disney World but with dino's. Though I wasn't too happy to see little Triceratops being piggy back rided like pony's. The main characters are two brothers, one horny teenager, one 10 or 11 year old. They are pretty dull and boring. Especially the older one. He's so preoccupied with women he doesn't even pay attention to the damn dinosaurs! Pretty stupid! They get themselves into trouble by leaving the tourist route. All this while the Indominus Rex is rampaging through the park. Chris Pratt is called away from the Raptors he's been training to save the children and hunt down the Indominus. The story isn't all that but the visuals are amazing! The park looks great, the dino's are so awesome! Especially the raptors and the Indominus which fits the JP world well. The visuals are in great contrast with the characters. The kids have this stupid family issue that should never be in my JP movie! It's so dull and you won't give a damn about it! Chris Pratt is awesome in this flick but he isn't all that different from Starlord in GotG, which isn't a bad thing by any means. It would be a shame though if he were to be typecast as this kind of character from now on. Musically the flick disappoints a bit. The infamous JP theme is back but underused and when it's used, it isn't even for a big dino moment. But you can't help but get goosebumps because after all these years, the Jurassic Park theme just sounds amazing! However, sometimes when the music gets ominous and a big orchestral theme is playing, the volume is turned down so much you really notice it! Very weird...The Indominus Rex is scary! I never thought the first three JP's were scary because I loved dinosaurs so much I was just too excited to see them in action to be really scared! The Indominus however, is a dinosaur you've never seen before! It's big, scary and oh so smart! He's built up so well too! Every scene he's in, the suspense is real! He truly feels like this unstoppable force. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the worst part of JP3 has been redeemed here! The ending is just so epic! It's perfect! I was just buzzing in my seat and people around me were just shouting in excitement! This movie has just so much fan service with references to the original, little details you can just geek out about and perhaps the best introduction to the hero of the franchise since JP1! People were applauding during the end credits, something Avengers: Age of Ultron didn't manage to do...In conclusion: though I have many gripes with this movie, the fan service, action, visuals and Chris Pratt make this entry in the series so worth it! I saw it yesterday and I'm going to see it again tonight! Hope to see you there!",Jurassic World
678,Muhammad_Nd,Raptors!,10,14 July 2016,"Movies are made to entertain us, and ""World"" does a very good job. It brings back the park, enhances it with new rides, and giving us state- of-the-art special effects. Twenty years ago, the illusions were breathtaking because they were fresh, and the technological advances keep raising the bar, and like one of the protagonists in the film said it: audiences keep demanding bigger and better.There is something winning about seeing those mythical creatures come back to life and teach us the error of our ways. One shouldn't wander into their territories and expect no consequences, and we should have learned by now that playing God is a recipe for trouble. We have seen the T-Rex in action, and the devious raptors cause plenty of chaos. Why would anyone want to bring them back after all the havoc they caused in the last three films? Because we have audiences that are hungry for their adventures.Scientists have gone completely crazy now as they use genetic engineering to come up with a more terrifying looking beast that unfortunately combines many of the species used to produce its distinctive look and qualities and as a certain scientist tells us that you can't have something that looks scary without other behavioral traits.The new dinosaur is bigger, meaner, and more psychotic than its other relatives. It manages to trick the park security and before we learn how to say its name correctly, he goes on a killing rampage, having a definite taste for targeting humans. In an interesting twist, raptors are back and can be trained to work as ""security"". The idea is interesting and laughable since we have already forgotten these creatures aren't exactly docile.Here comes Chris Pratt, with his matinée idol presence, being a bit of a ""raptor charmer"", or maybe he's just a very good teacher. He has taught them well and earned somewhat their trust; he just doesn't know that these raptors might soon discover they have an unexpected alliance with some of the park's other residents, and it doesn't involve being friendly to humans.There is plenty of spectacle as children are being chased, nannies and other security personnel become dinosaur chow, and the park manager can fashionable wield an automatic weapon and run even faster than some of the other people in five-inch heels. Howard has plenty of fun playing a female Indiana Jones and is Pratt's match. She's also quite an aunt to those nephews she neglects and almost feeds to her new park attraction.Lastly, one mustn't forget this is like a park ride. There is not much to think about, just get on it and enjoy the new offerings, the thrills, the looks, and the scares. Otherwise, stay home and read a book because this is not food for thought but a thrill for the audience.",Jurassic World
679,Donnie_Quixotic,Killer cartoons kill cartoonish humans and nobody cares,4,24 June 2015,"I started looking at my watch pretty early on. I thought the point of movies like this was to give the audience the feeling of ""What if?"" -- In this case what if humans recreated dinosaurs and opened a theme park and the dinosaurs escaped their enclosure? How would you feel? How would you react? What could go wrong? The first Jurassic Park did a great job of painting how different individuals would react in that situation. Remember the genuine terror those kids felt? -- screaming and exhausted and frightened. The fear in Sam Neil's eyes. The lawyer who leaves the kids to fend for themselves. Anyway, I could go on. The point is all the characters showed a range of emotions that the audience could relate to. They are the emotions we believe we would feel in such a terrifying situation. The Lawyer represents our baser urges of wanting to flee, in spite of those we leave behind (in this case, the two kids in the care with him). Sam Neil represents the responsibility of those he's been entrusted with. Laura Dern, represents maternal instincts and emotional intelligence. Wayne Knight's character harbors feelings of ingratitude and greed. So we live vicariously for two hours through those characters because we understand the way they feel... even the baser emotions of the more despicable characters. In sharp contrast, Jurassic World treats every character like the two dimensional page it was written on. There's no genuine fear displayed. There's no feeling of ""Oh that's how I would react"". I mean when Chris Pratt is under the car when the I-Rex escapes and he just looks at that guy for a moment before the guy is eaten, I couldn't help but feel if that guy was Bryce Dallas Howard's character, then Pratt's character would have tried to distract the dinosaur, or at least do something... anything. Instead he just watches as the I-Rex finally eats him. Not much of a hero, but the character that was eaten was only a bit player, unattractive, and overweight, so his death means nothing. And that's the problem: every death in this movie means nothing. It barely acknowledges when people start being killed. You would think even one death should have some effect on Bryce Dallas Howard's character but she remains seemingly unaffected. Oh wait a second, she cries after coming across a dying dinosaur. An emotion that has no development whatsoever -- it just suddenly appears. Nice to see she can cry at the death of a dinosaur but not an ounce of evident remorse when people are being killed. We, as the audience, don't just go to observe the unraveling of the plot, we go to experience every scene vicariously through the characters. For that vicarious feeling to work we need to relate to the characters emotionally. The same way we get emotional when watching our team play a game of football or basketball or whatever sport. We're emotionally invested in our team, so it means something to us. Watching a game without our team playing doesn't have the same effect on us. On top of that we usually have a favorite player who we're even more emotionally invested in. He or she is usually the player that does the things we believe we would do if we had the opportunity and ability. We get even more emotionally invested in the player if he or she is a great person off the field -- especially if they're funny and charismatic. Again we're feeling ""I want to be like him or her"". Same goes for characters in a movie. The hero has to be a person who does the right thing, no matter what the cost. Pratt's character made no effort to save that poor guy. And the fact is he didn't even have to save him, he just had to try to save him. Anyway this is just one example. Bryce Dallas Howard's character has no redeeming qualities until near the end of the film. She's given the same aloofness that Sam Neil's character had in the first film when it comes to kids, but Sam Neil was given the opportunity early on to show that he has a heart of gold. The moping teenager was a chore to watch -- what was the point of having a moping teenager who does practically nothing in the film other than mope? Oh he fixes a car, so teenagers are useful after all was the message I guess. Is the point to have a character for each age and gender demographic? When I was a kid most of the characters I watched were in their 30s and 40s -- I didn't need a character my own age to vicariously experience the events of the movie through. Nor did I need a male representative when I was watching Ellen Ripley outsmart and slaughter aliens. I was happy to experience the film vicariously through her, despite the fact she is a woman and I'm a man. I'm not saying don't have them in the movie, I'm saying do have them in the movie, but not just as tokens to ticked off; instead represent them accurately and entertainingly. It seems, it's not about having a great story anymore; it's about trying to represent every possible demographic, but only to a point that couldn't possibly be offensive to any individual within those demographics. It's so constrained as to have the human emotional element almost completely removed. Is it at least fun? Fun is watching an entertaining movie. It's not fun feeling bored because the movie was emotionless, uninvolving and poorly written.",Jurassic World
680,jmforsyth-33291,The Definitive Jurassic Sequel,7,16 September 2021,"I just watched all the Jurassic films this week for the first time ever. I couldn't believe how subpar The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 were - it was a very real drop in quality. Then comes Jurassic World.It is by no means as awesome or innovative as the first one - I would say the special effects in 1993 are better than 2015 which is saying something. JW doesn't have terrible effects but 1993 blends practical and CGI perfectly, using practical up close and CGI in the wide shots, it is beautiful. JW has an over reliance on CGI but that is more of an industry problem than a fault this specific film should have to shoulder by itself.Jurassic World is the definitive sequel to the original blockbuster, paying homage where it needs to and trying out new ideas where it can. It really feels like a love letter to Spielberg's original and even includes some ideas he wasn't able to incorporate into his own sequel (I.e. The motorcycle scene).The film has it's flaws such as lack of tension in some areas, some poorly timed comedic relief moments, some wooden characters, predictable outcomes, etc. But it is loads of fun and has some truly epic moments of action as well, and without spoiling anything has a scene that one could argue is the best in the entire franchise.I think with the sixth film in this franchise coming down the pipeline soon it is safe to say nothing will ever top the original nor should any of them be expected to. Jurassic World does exactly what a sequel should do by adding to the fun and expanding the world in new and exciting directions and in the process does something neither of the previous sequels could.7/10.",Jurassic World

That have poor dialogue and horrible special effects. Well that's Jurassic World, with exception of the sfx.Jurassic World looks expensive, has some fantastic shots but unfortunately nobody seemed to care about writing interesting characters or story lines. And if the characters are so badly written it's not surprisingly that the actor's deliver poor work.Yes, the movie has a few funny moments but the entire cast is uninteresting, shallow and predictable. Basically just like the storyline.I had some expectations for this movie but I have to say that the 14 minutes of dino's in Jurassic Park had more impact on me than the 5 best minutes of Jurassic World. I expected this to be the best of the franchise after the original. But in the end it turned out to be almost as bad as JP 3",Jurassic World

683,LTSmash14,Joke Bait and Nostalgia,6,18 June 2015,"Starbucks Presents: Jurrasic World: A Pandora Presentstion. Spielberg has gotten a hold of Chris Pratt's ""All The Harrison Ford Roles"" reel (the Solo vest, the close calls with closing gates...)and helped some guys splice it with dinosaurs to make a movie. At least, I think it was a dinosaur movie... it might have been a movie about family... or brotherhood... or militarization... or god complexes... or hubris... or relationships... or dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. They were the villains... or maybe the villains were the military guys... or the science guys... or the humans in general... or the adonimous rex... or the raptors... I dunno, but I'm pretty sure the T Rex was the protagonist. Bold move not introducing the protag until the third act. In a film that was basically ""cinemasins"" bait, prepare for unexplained explosions and plot developments that somehow don't develop the plot (like... why did it matter about it being part raptor? Why was that a big reveal). On an island in south America, run by a middle eastern guy, everyone working and visiting will be white and American. Watch one woman shoot and kill a dino eating a man and immediately hear ""wow, your boyfriend is badass."" But don't worry, feminists, she'll outrun a T Rex in high heels later. (Yeah. Get in real tight on those high heels). Watch as Chris Pratt's ""funny bumbling dude"" persona is stripped from him and handed to Jake Johnson and replaced with a fake tan and an ability to emote using only his eyelids. Enjoy the nostalgia like the original DNA animation, the ageless scientist, and the entire park from the first movie which has just been left there to rot for some reason. Revel in fear at the ADONOMOUS REX, a dino with so many undefined powers, it even manages to change it's scale throughout the movie. Then sit and reflect that you just contributed 20 bucks to that movie's gross and notice the blatant sequel set ups. *sigh* where's Goldbloom when you need him?

More people should of died, movie looked to be more into dinosaur and human team work which I liked but could of been more of a better script. What really got my attention was when the old TREX showed up, and went one on one with new dinosaur. I think they should of included dinosaur from third film when he killed Trex.

685,tudormon,One of the most idiot movies ever - easily!,2,30 August 2015,"This is beyond bad, it's insulting. Did I mention spoilers? There, I did.People run in front of super killer dinosaurs and, when they really have to, they outrun it. The two kids run from their capsule while the dinosaur is cracking it and, after a short sprint, at the edge before the water they clearly would jump into, they have time for a little chat while the dinosaur is catching up, clearly exhausted due to their speed. Later in the movie, a corporate lady in a dress (yes, a dress) and high heel shoes (yes, high heel shoes) runs in front of a T-Rex (yes, a T- Rex) to lead him to the other killer dinosaur. Let me make this clearer - she doesn't cheat and get the jump on him, oh no no no, the lady lets the T-Rex get close and then sprints in her - wait, did I say high heels? there, I said it.The park has a super dinosaur kept in secret with very little security measures. A self destruct collar (we push the button you die, you take it out you die) would be in order. Then, although they have a tracking device on it, their system shows that from ""thermal"" point of view the cage is empty (whilst others can look at the tracking device and identify it's in the cage), so they go in. Then, it gets loose. So, they bring a helicopter squad and kill it. Oh, wait, they DON'T. They send a crew on foot to stun-gun it. Stun. Gun. IT. They had a better chance dressing up the crew commander as a clown and, assuming the dinosaur did not have a fear of clowns, entertain the thing while the rest of the crew would insert a sleeping suppository in the dinosaur's rectum. Only after the crew dies they bring the helicopter squad and kill it. Oh, wait, they DON'T. They let loose four smaller dinosaurs in order to kill it.I'm too tired to continue. See the movie for more fun. Try not to pay for it.",Jurassic World

There are kids at risk, studly good guy, flaky damsel, money-grubbing owner and the evil security mastermind. Same as the first film. The animals were very life-like and the digital artists earned their pay. But what to do with these wonderful creatures is what drags this epic down. The screen writing and story were shaky and trite. As Captain Barbosa once said: ""It does stretch credulity."" There were too many inconsistencies throughout the film to list. However, the most disturbing part of the movie was when the research doctor and all of the embryos were airlifted out - thus - ensuring a sequel or four.",Jurassic World

The character Claire that is in charge of the park gets dozens of people killed and 100s injured and the movie portrays her as a hero! Madness! If her character was a man, he would've been eaten by dinosaurs or imprisoned. Not only does her character do nothing right in the movie but somehow Chris Pratt falls in love with her. Why? Because she's so good at getting people killed? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!",Jurassic World
688,BigCinnamon,Excellent entertainment without the warmth and charm,7,16 June 2015,"If I was forced to choose one movie from my childhood to call my favourite it would be Jurassic Park. I went into this from the trailer really looking forward to it as I liked the idea that they managed to realize Hammond's dream and finally create this amazing theme park rather than it all going balls up at the research stage.Overall I thought it was really entertaining, it looked amazing, and I was never bored for a second. There was a really nice blend of referencing the past, little nods to nostalgia, and then some new really creative exhibits and activities to do at the park that made me wish something like this was real. The plot was fine, it was only ever going to go down the way everyone expects it. I found myself thinking a lot through it that it just lacks a bit of charm and warmth, that's not unique to most action movies today though. There's two major issues I had:1) Human characters - I love Chris Pratt but he was very miscast here. Not much joy or fun in his character. Bryce Dallas Howard was pretty dull unfortunately, if we were supposed to feel the attraction building between her and Pratt throughout the movie then their lack of chemistry totally threw that out the window. Older boy was so unlikeable - the whole weirdness with his girlfriend and then checking out other girls at the park went nowhere, seemed pointless, and just made him seem like a jerk. Younger boy was okay, but I never felt the urgency that he ever thought he was in danger or was terrified like the kids in the 1993 movie really gave off. Vincent D'Onofrio - I'm not sure why we needed such a super villain character, was Wilson Fisk fresh in his mind?2) So much Military and war stuff - Is the world so obsessed by super military weapons and impending war that we can't even have an innocent movie about dinosaurs without the grander picture being about creating killing machines for the Army?It was an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, the creation of the dinosaurs were fantastic, the action was edge of your seat stuff. Fans of Jurassic Park will get a kick out of the nostalgia but may be left disappointed if they try to compare the two, as with the Jurassic Park sequels that suffered in the same way.",Jurassic World

Yes, it's very heavy on the nostalgia, and yes there are moments that will bring tears to your eyes if you are a die-hard fan, also it's full of Easter eggs.Some of my friends may say that the movie is very much predictable as it goes on, I don't argue with them, Even they may say that the story line is weakest among the four, still I don't argue with them, but now if I tell about the cinematic experience (For which people go to movie hall again n again), if I tell about the Forever thrilling journey that will bound to stuck your head, if I tell the Dinosaur effects in this film are probably the best in the series so far, hope no one there in the world to oppose me.So, friends please don't go with the critics for this movie, just go and grab your childhood surprises as soon as possible.

690,cgrill8,A true sequel to a classic film,10,12 June 2015,"OK, I read the 2 novels before the original movies came out, and was hooked back in 1991/92 when the original movie came out. Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they're worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I'm still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it's Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn't a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main 'side characters' are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I'll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)Don't let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren't exactly 'tamed', barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg's personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.The island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its 'history' (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can't say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there's a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable. Please note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn't take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than ""I think this was Gennaro..."" Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don't listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here.",Jurassic World

692,Blogger66,Colin Trevorrow Got Away Lucky!,9,14 July 2016,"Once the Jurassic World released in theaters, the rating scale was quite high as expected by reason of the Jurassic Park fans viewed before others who are generally like to watch the movies. I thought the rating would eventually end up between 5.6 to 6.1, but since for one year and two months, the rating of 7.0 by the total of 1,278 users is still surprisingly high. I read several reviews in order to understand why it's received high ratings. From what I've noticed, it's mostly just because of its brand. Thanks to Steven Spielberg for accomplishing Jurassic Park as a classic film. Jurassic 2 and 3 were ultimately disappointing. The majority of users were sleepless in the process of waiting for an exciting dinosaurs movie. It's often praised for spectacular special effects and the CGI is insane. Also with 3D, the visual looks more realistic than ever. So from the users' standpoint, they were thinking... ...Holy sh*t!! Damn 3D, I felt like I was almost being bite by dinosaurs!! WHOA F*CK it's how the dinosaurs look!?!? WOW SH*T F*CK IT'S DEFINITELY A CRAZY RIDDEEEE WHOOAAA!! F*CKING JEZZ I'M GIVING IT 10 OUTT OF 10!!!! OH, THAT'S JURASSIC PARK I'M TALKING ABOUT!!...Do you think it'll receive 7.0 rating in total if it isn't part of the classic Jurassic franchise?Sounds lame, huh? Unfortunately, I couldn't give it any lower than 9 out of 10 because it blew my mind enough to be in the same category as Blackfish that won the Satellite Award for Best Documentary Film in 2014. It's about the controversy over captive killer whales for the sake of greed and profit. Because of that, Sea World's profits dropped 84% and forced them to turn in a different direction. From my standpoint, Blackfish changed my perception of Sea World and maybe Zoo like Michael Jordan for the Chicago Bulls and Jurassic World is a wonderful assistant to Blackfish like Scottie Pippen for Michael Jordan. The viewpoint during the first thirty minutes of Jurassic World is a masterpiece of far- reaching suggestion given in an indirect manner, not blunt like Blackfish. It portrayed especially the wealthy whites who could afford to attend a dinosaurs theme park on an island. I could felt the spirits there were much alike the Sea World I've gone to in San Diego and Orlando. Like the whale show, people screamed with excitement when the dinosaurs in water were giving a show. They jumped and cheered when the dinosaurs splashed water on them. All about the adventure at theme park is exactly the same as the Sea World but different animals. While watching, I didn't feel comfortable because the way they treat dinosaurs is just as the way we treat animals at Sea World, and it's just for the sake of entertaining and making money. It's not possible for the dinosaurs to enjoy their staying at theme park, just like other animals. It helped me to understand better why Tilikum, a whale or say orca, took every opportunity to kill someone when it could and it did three times at the Sea World in Orlando. Like Tilikum, the dinosaurs seized the opportunity to beat the humans. While watching, I was thinking holy sh*t I'm not any better than people there because I went to Sea World and I cheered when the whale splashed water on me. That convinced me even more to support the idea of stopping theme parks like Sea World and possibly Zoo. Other one, the D-Rex is a genetically-created hybrid dinosaur, considering the strongest and largest dinosaur for tourism purpose. Sorry to say, the D-Rex reminds me of pitbull because people from years ago breeding strongest dogs. That's how the pitbull came in picture. Like D-Rex is a ""fake dinosaur,"" pitbull is a ""fake dog."" However, the story line and acting are absolutely horrible. Colin Trevorrow got away by luck with his creativity at right time, as an ongoing controversy between animal activists and Sea World. Just really, really lucky like Pete Carroll called to throw the ball instead of running Marshawn Lynch and Colin Trevorrow made a game-saving interception that won Jurassic Franchise.",Jurassic World
693,geebeegb1,It was okay.,6,14 June 2015,"The movie is engaging and has some really great special effects. However, some of it is overdone. As a huge fan of the original (Jurassic Park), I was slightly disappointed as I was waiting for the awe that never quite happened. The story line was weak, the acting nothing special but the movie was visually stunning at times.I have little doubt Jurassic World will be a great winner for those who are not familiar with the original (Jurassic Park) and I am sure that number is massive since it has been 20+ years.

This movie is everything the trailer promised it would be : a 2-hour silly but entertaining dinosaurs-filled, action-packed adventure film! I was worried it would have too many cheesy one-liners and one-dimensional, helpless, annoying characters but it does a good job of avoiding those weaknesses : the few jokes are well timed and actually funny and I found myself caring for most of the main protagonists. It's true that it is not particularly innovative compared to the previous trilogy : there are a lot of similarities between this film and 1993's Jurassic Park; some of them are clearly intentional and meant as a homage, which was kind of a nice touch I thought. If I had to complain, I would say that the director overused the famous close-up shot of a carnivore's head approaching and sniffing its human prey.

696,jakobgf-95,"If you don't take it seriously, you will have a good time.",6,18 June 2015,"If you look at it from an objective point of view, technically, this movie is average at best. But if you manage to leave your brain turned on, given that you have one, you will have a lot of fun watching this one. Not that this film is so bad that it's good, but if you just walk into the theater expecting a fun monster movie you won't be disappointed.The fact that this movie is ironically ripping of Godzilla, might annoy a few people, but the movie is well aware of this. Things like the leader of a group of soldiers, who are basically the Tokyo military, being an Asian, that some people are wearing bullet proof wests while hunting a dinosaur or a dinosaur running in slow-motion, just to name a few, leave the impression that you are not supposed to take this seriously. Also, there are a lot of hilariously clichéd moments like the human villain and the forced family drama of our main characters which are supporting this impression even more. The downside of this though, is that the ""emotional"" scenes are almost painful to sit through because of our main characters.The Characters itself weren't that bad, but sometimes during my view i got the feeling, that the writers didn't know how to write teenagers. I mean, i know that wanting to go home to his girlfriend is the only character trait that Zach has but no one, no matter the age, would be bored watching dinosaurs. But in the middle of the film he instantly switches mood with his little brother and is ready to pick up other girls. Grays trades are also only serving as a plot point and Chris Pratts character basically never changes throughout the whole film which means that the only somewhat believable character we have is Claire who at least has something that could be called development. I know that i said that you shouldn't take this seriously, but that doesn't mean that you cant have good characters. However, i have to say that the acting is really good, even the kids are not that bad. There where only two scenes where i burst out laughing because a character spontaneously decided to cry in an instant with no reason other to have an emotional scene but it was just hilarious to me. However, i was glad that all of them are somewhat connected to each other and not some random strangers who just happen to run into each other. The action is pretty good and makes for some really cool fight scenes and the fact that you can predict everything that is going to happen doesn't make it less fun.The directing and overall cinematography wasn't anything special but it was descent enough. The only thing that i really didn't like was the the use of the score. First of all, it's not really a good soundtrack. Not bad, but also not something that i haven't heard before. My problem is that the soundtrack was way overused. Ther are a lot of scenes where the movie tries to build tension without knowing that some of them would be way more intense without any background music whatsoever. If a director doesn't allow the imagery on the screen to speak for itself and puts in a soundtrack that tells the audience that they should be afraid or something, than it kinda ruins it for the people paying attention. Not that i demand no background music at all but it could be at least a little bit more subtle because there was basically no scene where the score didn't try to tell you how you should feel. There where also a few other things like no explanation why the Park suddenly works, why they need dinosaur holograms other than to function as another cheap plot point even though there are real dinosaurs in this world or a forced death scene of some random dinosaur but those are only minor issues and didn't bother me that much during my view.Overall, i'm really glad that this film doesn't really try to be a successor to the original, but rather just having fun with the idea of dinosaurs running amok. I'm happy to say that with this one we got another good monster movie the third year in a row and i had a lot of fun watching it.",Jurassic World

It is actually made in a way so kids would love it and yeah from that point it is good, but the only thing which may disturb parents may be dinosaurs attacks.If I have to speak about music, it was epic , kind a remembered me something from Star wars, special effects were really good.The only , but one of the most important thing for me, when ever I watch a movie is story and I kind a felt that Jurassic Wold was lacking it! I found it rather flat. There were a lot of scenes which were too predictable, action parts were too predictable and of course faith for main characters were kind a known in the movie beginning, in my opinion nothing will surprise an adult, but for kid this may be really good movie!",Jurassic World
700,WinterbornTM,"Fun, but the magic is missing",6,10 September 2015,"Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow, who also directed the great indie movie Safety Not Guaranteed, and is a sequel to the Jurassic Park movies. Now, history as proved that the Jurassic Park sequels are not that good, the second one is only half as good as the first one and the third one is plain bad. Jurassic World is the best sequel to Jurassic Park, but unfortunately, that isn't saying much.The action picks up 20 years later after the first one, and now the tourist attraction known as Jurassic Park is called Jurassic World. But dinosaurs have been around for so long that the audience starts to lose it's interest in the subject so the higher-ups come with a new attraction, Indominus Rex, a genetically modified dinosaur with elements from other animals. And of course, things go wrong. As one character quips in the movie: ""These people never learn"".This is not a bad movie, but it's also not very good. It misses the great characters, the stunning visuals, the breathtaking imagery of the first one. This becomes a generic CGI-driven monster movie. It's fun, but it has no heart. A big complaint for me is the overuse of CGI for the dinosaurs. There are a lot of scenes where it simply looks fake. And you know that is not a good thing when a movie released in 1993 has better looking dinosaurs than one in 2015.As far as the actors go, this movie is lead by Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, a former marine who now trains raptors. He does the best he can, but this tough guy, bad-ass type role doesn't really work for him in contrast with his more goofy roles from Guardians of the Galaxy or Parks and Recreation. But of course, he has some funny one-liners, and, for the most part, he delivers. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the park's manager, and I'm sorry to say, but she's not doing a very good job. Vincent D'Onofrio as the head of the security does a decent job, and the two kids, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are good also, especially Ty Simpkins, who comes from his nice role in Iron Man 3.All in all, this movie is a fun summer ride, with some nice action and suspense, but doesn't come any near the magic of the first one. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.",Jurassic World
701,Bistoman,"Great Fun if You are under 12, Not much for the rest of Us.",5,19 June 2015,"After the huge plot hole at the start I lost all love for this movie. Too much time is spent on the brooding older brother looking at teenage girls ( I know I'm not the intended audience ) But it gets real stale real quick. They should have spent a lot more time developing the park, You get a hint at what the park consists of, But only get to see a few of the attractions, Big fish tanks, Roaming Dino's ( That we have already seen in JP) and the obligatory T-Rex enclosure. The very thin plot of the absent aunt and divorcing parents added nothing. The moronic park owner? I wouldn't let him in charge of a doggy corner of a pet shop. The Military and Scientists were just Dino fodder, Waisted story lines. It should have been better . I like My big blockbusters, I want to be amazed, I wasn't.5 out of 10 is being generous. And that huge plot hole at the start??? Spoiler >>>>>>>>Why in gods name did they not just look at the security Tapes of the enclosure to see how and if Gigantor (I know that's not it's name ) Got out?And how did gigantor know that it was a tracking device that was implanted in it, Now I get He/She may have remembered that something was implanted in its body, But to know that it was an electrical tracking device? Come on?",Jurassic World
702,rachel-673-19946,So dumb. So awesome.,7,12 June 2015,"If I were to tell you the dubious sequence of sheer unlikely happenstance that leads to, well, the whole plot of JURASSIC WORLD, you would shake your head in abject wonder. Wonder at the downright ballsiness of the writers who decided to make coincidence their bitch throughout proceedings. Wonder at the director who pondered the laws of random chance and decided statistical anomalies happen all the damn time, not to mention consecutively and to the very same people. And then you would stop shaking your head, and simply begin to wonder: why don't I care?After which, since I am certain you have seen the first movie, along with possibly one or both of the earlier sequels (the second being the slightly lesser of two evils, but only in the same way that Kourtney is less insufferable than Kim), you would doubtless realize why it is that all the shoddy plot-devicing, lame expositioning and cynical jump-scaring does not matter a jot. Because the first JURASSIC PARK was also full of shameless flukes and incongruous twists of fate, but you, me, we all loved it anyway. Because: DINOSAURS.And here, woah are there dinosaurs. There are dinosaurs of so many shapes, sizes and varieties that they had to make up a whole new kind of one just to keep things interesting, because people apparently suck and somehow dinosaurs being ALIVE and IN ARMS REACH can get so very dull after a while. See, the folks at InGen, the company founded by the late demented, er, lamented impresario John Hammond have somehow recovered from no less than three deadly dino-rampages across a couple of decades – not to mention the pterodactyls that remained at large in San Diego at the end of III – and have built themselves a theme park the likes of which crazy old' Hammond could only have dreamed. Twenty thousand visitors a day, we are told not infrequently, now visit this exotic CGI wonderland on the ill-fated Isla Nublar in order to be dazzled by formerly extinct life- forms both docile and dangerous -- because, yeah, obviously. There are DINOSAURS there. No one is going to worry about that one time Newman from SEINFELD got killed when you can go hang with a Stegosaurus and be all like, whatever man.Overseeing all of this marvel and majesty is Claire (the preternaturally beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard), a woman who has time to painstakingly maintain a shiny blowout in South American humidity but not to take personal charge of the nephews she hasn't seen in seven years. These nephews have been sent thither because there is Trouble at Home – of which we are told but honestly DO NOT CARE and why this is even a thing we are told WE DO NOT KNOW – but Claire is far too busy getting Verizon to sponsor an exhibit (hello, one of many product placements!) and engaging in a love-hate romance with heroic raptor trainer Owen (an even-buffer-than-GUARDIANS Chris Pratt) to escort them around the park. Too busy, that is, until a convoluted and bordering on impossible string of nonsense conspires to see the boys – the older of whom is Ryder from MELISSA AND JOEY, and no, you may not mock me for knowing that – lost in the rain-forest with, and you won't even believe this, a killer dinosaur on the loose.The killer dinosaur on the loose part is actually good news for Ryder from MELISSA AND JOEY, because it is one of the few times he notices he's on an island full of dinosaurs. See, he's a disaffected teenager with Beats by Dre headphones and an eye to the cuties, so Triceratops rides and baby dino petting zoos are kids' stuff, yo. He's all about the hardcore adventuring, like recklessly taking his dinosaur-obsessed little brother deep into a restricted zone in a personal gyroscope that I hope is a real thing, and thence almost getting killed by, and you won't even believe this, a killer dinosaur on the loose.So it is up to the sparky Claire and Owen to save the boys, and also try, and you won't even believe this, to stop that killer dinosaur on the loose from killing everyone on the damn island. All the usual suspects are present and accounted for: there's a mad scientist, a mad billionaire and a mad weapons dealer (the always excellent Vincent d'Onofrio, in a very strange choice of role). There is also a somewhat mad but lovable system tech (NEW GIRL's Jake Johnson) who is the funniest thing in the film by far, since Pratt plays his action hero lead almost entirely straight—and, somehow, with a straight face. ""THAT is no dinosaur!"" he pronounces sternly at one point. Riiight.But it is actually the dinosaurs who do most of the heavy lifting in this movie, and it is for them that you really need to see it. Because you know what the other movies in this franchise were always missing? Giant dinosaur death matches! And, much like TRANSFORMERS – giant robots vs. giant robots! – and PACIFIC RIM – giant robots vs. giant monsters! – it is this spectacle that makes all the wackiness here worthwhile.There are several reasons to see this movie. Nostalgia is definitely a factor, as is the cast, as are the stunning visual effects up to and including the kick-est-ass dinosaurs you have ever seen on screen. The only real reason not to see it is that it has so many story problems it would make a daytime soap writer working on this month's seventh amnesia plot line grimace incredulously. But really, if you like dinosaurs, and if unconscionable acts of improbable concurrence aren't a deal-breaker for you, then I'm betting you'll find JURASSIC WORLD and its killer dinosaurs on the loose so much fun you won't even believe it.",Jurassic World
703,bans_004,Entertained!,8,11 August 2015,"First, lets not compare this to its predecessors. The aboriginal Jurassic Park certainly came with its own unique thrills. The Jurassic World not only revives the franchise, but also packs some punches on its own.The most enjoyable part for me, and a lot of others I talked to, was the 3D rendition. It jerked us off our seats more than a couple of times. The dinos were impeccably animated, and all in all, it was worth the trip to the cinema! However, the movie certainly had us arching our brows a few times as well. Fair warning, this movie build up on the previous installments, so do your revision before hitting the cinemas. I was highly skeptic of the lead cast, but they did not disappoint as much as the erotic plot. Come to think it it, it felt more of a dinosaur chase in a video game than a movie.",Jurassic World
704,filmcritic3,Dinos return to glory days,10,11 June 2015,"JURASSIC WORLD I do so love when a movie series returns to its creative roots. JURASSIC PARK was an epic film, and then Spielberg and company found a way to destroy its flavor with two banal sequels. After a lengthy hiatus that included much soul-searching, and dumping Jack Horner, JURASSIC WORLD brings the franchise back to the wonderfulness of the original.I try to not watch trailers before I see a movie. Often, they are misleading. At best, the reveal too many key plot elements or scenes. Unfortunately, the trailers for JURASSIC WORLD permeated media in a major advertising campaign blitz. What I saw in the trailers alarmed me. Did I actually see Velociraptors work along side the film's protagonist Chris Pratt, as a unified force? It reminded me of ALIENS VS. PREDATOR, where viewers were force-fed the notion a petite black woman was the only human representative capable of defeating a horde of aliens by teaming with the creatures who hunt humans for sport. Please. The concept was idiotic, and though they tried to salvage the movie series with a follow-up, the initial theme essentially destroyed the franchise in the world of celluloid.The raptors, in the same frame with Pratt, are not friendly creatures. Luckily, there are no ""we are family"" moments between species. I'll test your memory here, but think back to the second film in the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON series; THE REVENGE OF THE CREATURE. In the film, John Agar, experimenting on the intelligence of the gill-man, uses an electric prod to teach the word ""stop"" to the Creature. Through Pavlovian testing, the Creature hesitates at the sound. It establishes a necessary reaction for the climatic scene. The raptors work much the same manner in JURASSIC WORLD. It is done well.Now, consider Jack Horner. After JURASSIC PARK, Horner attempted to garner his fifteen minutes of Andy Warhol fame and used rather sketchy paleontology findings to discredit the Tyrannosaurus Rex. He claimed the King of Dinosaurs was nothing but a mooching scavenger. Somehow, he convinced Spielberg to shift attention away from Rex. It was a bad move that culminated in a horrendous JURASSIC PARK 3, where a Spinosaurus, which in reality measured only 20 feet compared to T-rex's 50 feet, fights and defeats Rex. Horner's new Rex theories were dismantled by his peers and colleagues within a year. He is now in the café of scientific oblivion, sipping coffee with the two researchers who tried to convince us of global warming with a fabricated hockey stick graph model. Rex is back in full glory in JURASSIC WORLD. In fact, he received cheers and applause from the preview audience when he appeared on screen. They were louder than any reaction to superheroes.JURASSIC WORLD makes many references to the original, and basically ignores everything from the sequels. It is twenty years past John Hammond's disastrous attempt to bring dinosaurs to a theme park. In that time, technology has improved, enabling Hammond's dream to become reality. Thousands of people visit JURASSIC WORLD on a regular basis, but as with all things, dinosaurs become mundane with the public and the park must find new and exciting ways to keep ticket sales booming. Enter Indominus Rex, a genetically built dinosaur hybrid, meant to add an element of fear and terror to park visitors. BD Wong returns as Dr. Henry Wu, and is the culprit behind creation of the new Rex. He is reminiscent of Dr. Susan McCallister, played by Saffron Burrows, in DEEP BLUE SEA, who created superior sharks, but opted not to tell anyone about the enhances features.In keeping with the Spielberg tradition of constantly putting children in danger, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson star as Gray and Zach, who are visiting the park while their parents attempt to end their marital bliss. There can never be happy families anymore in films. It doesn't fit the template of a dysfunctional society, so loved by liberal Hollywood ideology. Entrusted to the care of their aunt, the boys naturally find a way to immerse themselves in park havoc, while they discover the bond that exists between brothers. Meanwhile, Auntie Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, while chasing the All American Woman Executive Dream, has the hots for Owen (Pratt), who is in this story what Robert Muldoon should have been in the first. All these subplots are secondary and just provide hurdles for a tale about a genetic freak, and the dinosaurs who hate him.Critics were able to see JURASSIC WORLD in 3D. It is worth it. The dinos, especially the raptor attacks, are superb. The dinos look great, thanks to Ed Verreaux's production design. Cinematography by John Schwartzman is excellent and provides several iconic moments sure to appear on posters and memes. Music, though featuring additional tunes by Michael Giacchino is basically variations on John Williams memorable score.All in all, JURASSIC WORLD brings the series back to where it belongs. You can watch the first one, skip the second and third, and jump straight to this one and have a better franchise. The movie is filled with dinosaurs and dinosaur action. It's worth repeated views and deserves a spot on your home video shelf. As such, it exemplifies excellence in film entertainment and captures the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2015. You'll like this one; it's a keeper.10/10",Jurassic World
705,flowertimezones,Nothing great,5,3 August 2015,"Jurassic World is nothing more than a simple action movie. If you like action, it might be your cup of tea. If you like more of a story or good characters, you won't find it here. The dinosaurs are the most interesting characters. The main hero and heroine are too silly to be taken seriously. He in his Indiana Jones outfit, she all in white, riding around trying to save to very forgettable kids. I can't even remember anyone's name in the movie. The love story is so weak, they could have done without it. I can recall all of the characters from Jurassic Park clear as day all these years later. But not one from this movie. The dinos fare better but my major complaint is that the genetically engineered dino was made to look too much like T-Rex. I could barely tell them apart. A lot of mayhem and fast scenes, but nothing more.",Jurassic World
706,swanmj,"Not quite as good as the original, but still awesome",8,27 June 2015,"I watched this in theaters this month with friends and family, and I was endlessly captivated by this movie. Even though it was not quite as ""original"" as the 1993 classic, ""Jurassic World"" still has a lot of action and suspense. I especially liked the part at the end where the Velociraptor, the T. Rex, and the Mosasaurus unite against the Indominus Rex, especially since, throughout the movie, one gets the illusion that the Indominus Rex is an unstoppable killing machine. I thought that they would have to go nuclear to kill the Indominus Rex! There are also homages to the original movies throughout the movie as well, like the animated DNA guy used in the original 1993 ""Jurassic Park"", as well as the 1992 Jeeps that are used in the movie! I highly recommend this movie for the action, suspense, and killer dinosaurs!",Jurassic World
707,Mahmood-Buttrumps,The best effort in Hollywood CGI Animation,1,17 June 2015,"Colin Trevorrow is touted to be able to do it all- count to infinity, can find corners in circles, out-Speilberged Spielberg, has played Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun and won etc. But one thing he clearly cannot do is to ensure that every film of his entertains. Jurassic World may boast of all that motion capture technology, but put side by side Bollywood exploits such as Kochadaiiyaan, it comes off as an amateurish, cartoonish effort.Pratt is virtually in every frame of the film, and as usual he oozes style and confidence. While the movie is decently paced, every scene is either some human drama or a non-dino sequence. The result of the motion capture technology is abysmal. The reason for doing motion capture is to impart real feel to animated characters. In Jurassic World, the effect is opposite- there is no real emotion in the facial shots of the dinos. Had it been a live action film, it might have looked good. But today's audience used to Avatar and its ilk, this mediocre effort simply does not cut the cake. Even Cars 2 features better animation! The whole mess is rather dreary. It maintains no consistent tone aside from rushed desperation. This is nothing like the colorful silliness the Japanese monster movies are famous for.This expensive experiment to immortalize our reptilian brethren might be good enough for die hard fans, but still cannot make up for its complete lack of connect, and its technical shortcomings. The last scene indicated a sequel and more product placements from ecco-friendly coporations- hope that is done better. 3/10",Jurassic World
708,sanwit,This Park is indeed open!!!,8,13 June 2015,"Jurassic World pays a lot of homages to Jurassic Park. So let's get that out of the way! This movie wastes no time going over other subplots but takes you directly to the Park (or is it the World now?!) You have all watched the trailers, and you all know that this kid and his brother go on a trip to Jurassic World, and turns out that they are both nephews of Claire Dennings (Bryce Dallas Howard), the Park Operations Manager. This movie takes place on Isla Nublar where Jurassic Park was staged. The old park also makes a fleeting appearance in this movie. Irrfan (Simon Masrani) is one of the richest men on the Earth and he practically owns InGen, and he is the one who still has the dream of John Hammond alive in his eyes. Well, we are greeted with lots of (Samsung) displays in (ahem!) the 'Samsung Innovation Centre', and when the camera zooms in on a kid brushing dust out of dinosaur bones, God, I miss Sam Neill & Laura Dern! Soon, we are greeted by a few people in suits and, no, while they are not lawyers, they are the PR team from Verizon who want to sponsor an animal, and (drumroll!!!) we are greeted to the Indominus Rex. People who are on Verizon, be warned, not the least due to the fact that the Park has bad reception! Anyways, with that out of the way, we are introduced to Star Lord (oops), I meant Chris Pratt, who is sort of the ringmaster for raptors, and then hell (or should I say Indominus Rex) breaks loose. The movie is a fun ride but I need to make a few observations. Kids nowadays get scared easily compared to those from '93. I mean, yeah, they are acting, but Jurassic Park had much more thrills and suspense than this one. We are reminded this is a sequel, sometimes when they turn up the original Jurassic Park theme, sometimes by familiar faces like Henry Wu. Last time, Dennis Nedry (the computer guy), had a nefarious agenda. This time also, there is a subplot, which opens the storyline to possible sequels, but does not really go anywhere in this movie. It is a lot to demand of a movie when you put it alongside a movie that you grew up loving, but Jurassic World tries, and partly succeeds, in holding its own. The kids at the plex enjoyed the movie, and I dare say I would too, if I hadn't watched Jurassic Park first. And yeah, if any of the people who worked on this movie are reading this, I do prefer the T. Rex to the Indominus. The T. Rex still rules!",Jurassic World
709,jethrotroll-30807,"A trip back to Jurassic yields more of the same: countless clichés, extreme silliness and Nostradamus-like predictability",2,30 August 2015,"Ugh. This was bad. Horrifically bad. I'm not even sure where to start, except to say it is so pathetic that this is what block busters have become nowadays. It's such a shame that most of Hollywood has absolutely no idea what a good movie is anymore, as they keep churning out this pathetic crap.There were so many clichés in this movie that I lost count. First, you had brothers that have that certain age difference that they have grown apart, only to become closer before our very eyes as they fight to survive the chaos. Their Aunt (Claire), who manages the park and is supposed to look after them, is so self-consumed in her work that she has almost no value for life and has none of her own. The only available helicopter pilot just so happens to be an inexperienced one. Owen, the Raptors' trainer and movie bad-ass, is also romantically linked to Claire. I could go and on. And unfortunately with so many clichés, the movie became just one silly and predictable hot mess.At over 2 hours in length, the movie really drags on and became sillier and sillier as time passed. There were only 4 Raptors, but they were EVERYWHERE, in every scene, all over the island. It was ridiculous. Oh, and how does one kill a Raptor/Rex hybrid named Indominus Rex? Find a T-Rex and release it so they can fight it out of course!! Makes perfect sense, doesn't it? And of course the T-Rex, after defeating the Indominus with the help of a Mesosaurus (ugh) and a few Raptors, is intelligent enough to leave everyone else alone and just walk away into the sunset. LOL Yeah, that really happened in this movie. Is that silly enough for you? My favorite part of the movie had nothing to do with dinosaurs or lead characters, and it lasted less than 30 seconds. Near the end of the movie when they started evacuating the control room, a guy 'courageously' declared that he was going to stay back because 'somebody has too'. He then went in to kiss his co-worker and right before he planted his lips, she stopped him and said she has a boyfriend! LOL Now, if only the writers could have approached this script with that kind of creativity. And don't blame me if I thought this was the movie's best scene, I'm not the one that produced this garbage.I truly don't think that Hollywood could lower the bar any further with releases like this and Mad Max. But, I guess if you lower the bar far enough, it makes the mediocre crap look good. Maybe that's their plan. Because the opposite, where they actually think this is worthwhile entertainment, would be more troubling.",Jurassic World

The hype about this movie is, thankfully, decent and doesn't give too much away so one can enjoy the movie.The acting is ambitious and definitely holds your attention. The actors know how to switch from serious to comedy without much strain and there are hardly any cringe worthy moments from the acting.The 3D effects are good - predictable but good.

One moment it's empty; the next it's full with Jurassic herbivores. As if they decided per scene whether or not to turn the simulations on. It's a lot of dinosaur fights and as the film goes on the dinosaurs that fight each other get bigger and bigger. For boys who love dinosaurs it's probably a great film. Perhaps I should have realized, that I'm not the film's target audience. And what's all this about coca cola in the big studio films nowadays. Why does the hero/ine always pause for a nice long drink of coke?!? Does Coca Cola pay the film studio for these shots? It sure seems so. And why are disaster films always themed around broken relationships getting back together again? Boring. But, then, this film is not about story. It's about dinosaurs and they're impressive.

713,onlineairsoft,Absolutely ridiculous. Complete nonsense.,1,16 June 2015,"Premise of the film is as follows. I'm not joking it's actually true....Finally they've made a successful Jurassic Park tourist attraction. However the military secretly get involved behind the scenes as ask the park to create a brand new highly intelligent invisible and bullet proof dinosaur. Yes you read that right... a highly intelligent invisible and bullet proof dinosaur.......A invisible bullet proof dinosaur....Which without ever having interacted with humans knows how they think and how to trick them.Of course the dinosaur escapes and begins to kill everything. No one ever stops to ask what other dinosaur species made up this genetic hybrid... They have to find that out the hard way, bit by bit, when a simple phone call would of helped them massively.This is all happening whilst the 2 main terribly acted kids think it's a good idea to ditch their guardian and go off track into the middle of a dinosaur infested island... alone.Mean while the park ranger teams up with the raptors to go hunt the dinosaur. But that doesn't work because... the invisible bullet proof dinosaur can speak dinosaur... so he talks to the raptors and convinces them to turn on their human leaders.Obviously the next step is to get the T-Rex to help the humans. Luckily this lady with a high heels and a flare can out run the T- Rex let it chase her.. plus the invisible dinosaur can't speak T- Rex... so her plan works.I just can't understand how films like this get made without consulting experts to see if the ideas are actually feasible.They had a HUGE budget, a HUGE fan base ready to see the film... and they churn out this rubbish.Why not consult a dinosaur expert when writing a script that revolves entirely around dinosaurs?",Jurassic World
714,confrank,"Delivers on thrills and visuals, but don't expect much more",5,24 June 2015,"Jurassic World, starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, comes approximately 14 years after the movie watching world gave up on ever getting a good Jurassic Park sequel. This time at least, we get a plotframe that is completely different from Jurssic Park 2 and 3. It's not greedy idiots sending lambs for slaughter to an island overrun by dinosaurs to be inevitably eaten. No, we actually have a functioning theme park! And people go there as a vacation now since it's ""safe"". What could possibly go wrong...?Everything is the answer you're looking for, and no thankfully I'm not talking about the quality of the overall film. When buying a ticket with ""Jurassic World"" written on it, a set of expectations and visions form in your brain of how this movie is going to take shape. Whatever you imagined, I'm almost certain you're mostly right. Like me, you will likely be neither disappointed or surprised (or rather, disappointed you weren't surprised).Whatever tales you may have heard about bad CGI are false. The park, the dinosaurs and the landscape look great. There's some minor enhancements to the dinosaur animatronix that some have complained don't look like real dinosaurs. If that's you, let me ask you this: have you ever actually seen a real dinosaur in person? Didn't think so.Then of course there's our huge ensemble of characters. Jurassic Park had a small group of intermingled characters that worked very well off each other and really felt like they were united in the conflict together. In World, we get more characters, more plots, and sadly, a much more bloated feel to it as all of these separate plots make the movie feel disconnected. Half of these plots feel like obligatory clichès, and more focus on a few characters would've likely created an atmosphere closer to the heartiness and emotional gravitas of the original.Jurassic World is primarily marketed as a kids movie, so I understood why they initially thought putting two kids as key characters may be a good idea. However, all they really contributed was an absolutely pointless family subplot, grungy and mopey child angst and about 20 minutes of the movie we didn't really need. Aside from the kids, the antagonists of the movie were essentially cartoons. Within the first 30 minutes, you were mentally pointing out which ones would die and what horrible death they would be subject to, most of the time with clairvoyant precision. I was really hoping to see some surprises here that defied the conventional blockbuster. Sadly, they didn't seem interested in showing up.The only character you can truly care about here is Chris Pratt's Owen. He's for the most part, the moral center of the story, and easily has all the best action scenes. He has a very 80's action hero feel to him and Chris Pratt's charismatic, likable cockiness feels like a return from the decade. It's no wonder this guy is being fan cast for almost every action movie reboot or video game based movie in production, as there's no doubt after his Jurassic World outing he could pull off seemingly any of them.Of course at the end of the day, the real stars are those ancient, scaly, rascals causing all the trouble. They're what get butts in the theater seats, and when they come to fight, it's a damn good time. A little more dino v. dino would've been great, but we get enough to satisfy our hunger. Still praying for a hilarious Jeff Goldblum cameo in the sequel.FINAL VERDICT: Jurassic World may suffer from bloatedness and predictability like any sequel is prone to do, but for a movie about dinosaurs wreaking havoc on a theme park, we get plenty of suspenseful thrills and exciting action scenes to satisfy our summer blockbuster craving.",Jurassic World

716,tlupejkis,Such a Waste,2,15 June 2015,"Uninteresting storyline. Poor acting..though that is mainly due to the poor dialog given to them. Characters with no substance--did not care about them at all. I normally enjoy Vincent D'Nofrio, he was unconvincing as a villain and they dressed him in work clothing from Sears that was 3 sizes too small. Bryce Dallas Howard was dimwitted and couldn't act her way out of a paper bag-- they dressed her oddly too, in the beginning of the movie- very early 90s. The younger boy makes more whiny noises than speaks.A 14 year wait and this is what they came up with? A CGI fest. Fest or test to see how much they could spend on CGI and how little on wardrobe and script writers? I would rather watch Jurassic Park 3.",Jurassic World

I need to tell you that the overall script and performances are rather OK. However, a lot more had to be done to make it excellent. Apart that a lot of scenes are taking part in darkness in the second part of the movie, the performance of kids is not convincing. And the hair of the madam'Rex is just terrible, to say the least. Maybe the hairdresser went straight from the Jurassic era? :D I could praise a bit scriptwriters for the rather fun dialogues, at least they were not annoying. Then, why the last scene of the movie the creature appears totally ""healthy""? Not even a drop of blood. So there are some thingies as credibility as well (apart from the sc-fi nature of the movie, of course!). The same goes for the rescue missions - where are tanks and heavy army machines?

719,CyclopsKnowsBest24,A New World?,7,15 June 2015,"""Jurassic World"" (2015) is a film that has been in the making for many years. Continuing and/or reinventing an iconic franchise is no easy task, and many franchises have failed at this (even Disney/Marvel has just started to loose it's touch with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"").""Jurassic World"" is a film I was both extremely excited and nervous about. Since ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001) was such a disappointment (and possibly one of the worst sequels in movie history), I had some low expectations for this new film. I can happily say, however, that ""Jurassic World"" has brought the franchise back to what made it good in the first place.The film opens up to John Hammond's park being fully realized. It is already thrilling to see this park actually be opened to the public and full of people wanting to see the dinosaurs (almost like a SeaWorld replica). Of course as any Jurassic Park fan knows, this peaceful park won't last long.""Jurassic World"" excels at recapturing the nostalgia of the first film by having the iconic film score return, lots of suspense, violence, and action, fun humor, and great special effects. The cast is fun to watch as well and they give good performances all around. It makes it clear that this was a very fun film to make.The film does have it's share of problems, however. Like most summer blockbusters, some characters have little development and/or have very poor motives. This can take the viewer away from the experience, while also helping them quickly realize what Hollywood tropes are being used again and again.To sum up, while ""Jurassic World"" is very entertaining and engaging, it doesn't break any new ground. It takes all of the good from the franchise and puts it into one solid film. If you are looking for one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, you should go watch this film immediately. If you want a movie that challenges your thinking or has complex characters, I suggest holding off on this one.""Jurassic World"" 3 out of 4 stars Movie Recommendations (If you like it): Jurassic Park (1993), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Star Wars (1977), Jaws (1975) Movie Recommendations (If you don't like it): Alien (1979), X-men (2000), Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Interstellar (2014)",Jurassic World
720,mg3331,Jurassic World surprise hit!,8,15 June 2015,"The success of this movie is a little surprising considering it is just retreading old ground from the earlier films but now that I've seen it (must be viewed in 3D to fully appreciate it) I would have to say that it does deserve to be big box office. The dinosaur effects have improved slightly since the original movie. I found the first half a little slow but once the action started it had my attention. Of course like the other Jurassic films it had to have a couple of kids in danger (not really of course)and these two did pretty well on their own without adult help. At the climax we have an epic battle between the dinosaur creatures while the main characters get a ringside seat. As for the idea of having a Jurassic theme park well, if such a place was really possible and in the light of all the disasters in the previous films you would have to wonder how many customers they would really attract. I would say however it is a quite impressive piece of entertainment.",Jurassic World

722,starry42,A fun-filled addition to a great franchise!,8,15 June 2015,"22 years after John Hammond failed to receive endorsements for his new prehistoric theme park, the gates have officially opened. We return to Isla Nublar, home to the new and improved Jurassic World. I admit that the first act of the film kind of had me board, as it was mostly people talking. Despite my boredom, it does serve the purpose of introducing us to new characters. One of these new characters is the ""Raptor Whisperer"" Owen Grady (played by the ever-so-awesome Chris Pratt). We are also introduced to a new dinosaur, the Indigenous Rex, a genetic hybrid who hunts purely for sport. I do not want to give too much away, but I will say that despite some subpar CGI on the dinos, the action scenes are thrilling, and the final battle alone is worth the price of admission. While I do not believe that ""Jurassic World"" is nearly as good as the original film, it is a tad better that ""The Lost World"" and ""Jurassic Park 3"". Like many, I was disappointed by the lack of familiar characters (i.e. Grant, Malcolm, Satler) but the new characters are welcome additions to the franchise, and if a sequel does happen, it would be pretty cool to see Owen team up with the likes of Grant and Malcolm. Check it out, as I think it's the most fun you'll have in the movies this summer.",Jurassic World
723,brucloth,This is just bad,3,21 January 2018,"My title says it all. This film is nothing more than a ton of special effects, impossible action sequences, and ridiculous writing. 
Jurassic Park succeeded because it was fresh, well written, and had an exceptional case of actors. You felt the characters' excitement and wonder, and they behaved EXACTLY as a normal human being would. That made the film enjoyable, wonderful, and suspenseful. 
This movie has exactly zero of any of that. Characters that play park employees (other than the primaries), are slovenly fools, plain and simple. You could care less if they live or die. The boys are not cute, clever, or interesting. They really add nothing to the story, and I suspect they're there to give both teen and preteen girls somebody to (the writers hoped) like in the movie. The main woman is simply a dunce. Other than her physical appearance, she offers nothing of substance to the story. The main game master is really the only believable character - and just barely. 
Shall we discuss one of my biggest problems with this sorry mess? We've learned through the first three films that in the Jurassic Worlds, Velociraptors are the most intelligent and dangerous animals ever. But In this movie, the powers that be decide it's a good idea to release a pack of these predators to, wait for it, hunt down and contain the new Supersaurus Rex. Of course, there's just no chance the raptors would choose instead to hunt easy human prey is there? Utter balderdash. 
Hollywood has either forgotten or chooses to ignore a simple truth: MAKE YOUR CHARACTERS BELIEVABLE AND LET THEM ACT LOGICALLY.

727,j-lindsay-sens,"Lacked the magic of Jurassic Park, but was still fantastic",7,11 June 2015,"Im just your average movie goer, so i don't like to nit-pick, so here we go.This movie takes place after the original series, so in the same time-line, about 20 years after Jurassic Park 3. The movie starts off with two brothers leaving the city to visit Jurassic World, a theme park with real live dinosaurs. As the audience gets introduced to this park, with all kinds of different attractions and animals, we learn that the park has problems keeping a constant flow of guests. Dinosaurs are now mainstream and the attractions are mainly for children. To combat this, the park creates a new type of dinosaur ever couple years to boost attendance. However, things go bad when they bread the perfect predator, who of course gets loose and starts killing for fun.The brothers are out in the park when the dino gets out, and Chris Pratt must rescue them, while at the same time avoiding this new dino. He must also battle other people, as Igen, a government agency, is planning on using dinosaurs for future wars and they have a special interest in this new dino.The movie itself was really good. They skipped on making the dinos new a magically and took a different route. They introduced a theme park where the average people could pet, feed, and even ride dinosaurs. I loved this idea, of actually having a park created. The story line was not too complicated and easy to follow. Sometimes too easy and too predictable, but there were other moments which, at least myself, was surprised. The acting was pretty good, Chris Pratt was of course the best actor. The female lead, Bryce Dallas Howard, did a good job in her role, despite being in high heels in the entire movie(not likely). There has been criticism for the lack of a strong female lead, but she wasn't suppose to be the tough one, she was a business women and when everyone life was on the line, had the idea that saved everyone.So overall, i recommend this movie, it was really fun, lots of action, the best dinosaur fights I've ever seen, and some comedy thrown in that was, for the most part, not forced in. The raptors were not as domesticated as the trailer and appear, and I've heard criticism again about taking away the raptors as the sneaky deadly dinos, but they were amazing. The CGI was very well done, and made the movie a joy to watch......I gave it a 8/10 because it did have flaws, the women were always crying while the men were the strong ones, the comedy felt forced once or twice, it had predictable moments, but overall, it was very fun, very funny and worth the crazy expensive ticket price...Go see it, and sit back for a good time.....and people need to stop being so nit-picky",Jurassic World
728,jaredmartin-464-711711,Jurassic World is a Pale Imitation of Jurassic Park,5,14 June 2015,"Mild spoilersIt has been 22 years since Jurassic Park was released back in 1993, and 14 years since it's last poorly received sequel, Jurassic Park 3 hit theaters in 2001. Since then another Jurassic sequel had been in, and out of development for years. Supposedly issues with the script were what was taking the project so long to get off the ground, so one would think with the release of Jurassic World, now in 2015, the issues were fixed...think again.This new Jurassic World movie can really only be enjoyed as a dumb, mindless, monster action flick, which is far from what Jurassic Park, and even it's sequel The Lost World were. In both Spielberg directed Jurassic films, the dinosaurs, even while running around chasing people, always felt like animals. The use of animatronics in close up shots really helped the audience buy into that what they were seeing, were living, breathing, dinosaurs. What sets this film, and Jurassic Park apart, is that nothing feels genuine in this, everything is bigger, and more lavish just for the sake of it, but none of it feels realistic, something the first film while fictional, tried to make the audience buy into. Jurassic World on the surface looks grand, but there isn't any real depth, to really get invested with whats shown on screen.Jurassic World is essentially a reboot/sequel of Jurassic Park for a new generation of film goers, who deserve far more than this film has to offer them. The park is now a fully functional Sea World/Disney esque tourist attraction. The premise, while convoluted by multiple subplots, is really quite simple. In fact Bryce Dallas Howard's character says it, ""Bigger, louder, more teeth"". So basically a decline in public attendance, leads to the creation of a new genetically modified hybrid creature, to help bring attendance up. As one would expect this isn't a good idea, as the hybrid (Indominus Rex) escapes, and mayhem ensues.Jurassic World may be predictable, with far fetched concepts, like a Frankenstein like dinosaur, and semi trainable (militarized) Raptors, but the worst thing about Jurassic World are the characters, both in performance, and characterization. Pretty much every character in Jurassic world is bland, and uninteresting, some even cartoony. Even Chris Pratt, who seems to be all the rage these days, doesn't really shine with his Owen character, he is at least somewhat likable, unlike everyone else. Bryce Dallas Howard isn't a bad actress, but her performance in this film is awkwardly terrible, and thats mostly down to the script. In fact this film has many actors who are known to be good in other films, but seem awful because of the hammy, clichéd dialogue. The only actors who's performances I bought into were Jake Johnson as a control room technician, who was funny without trying to be, even with the poor script. The other was B.D. Wong's character Dr. Henry Wu, the only returning character from Jurassic Park. Wu shares a scene with Marsani, (played by Irrfan Khan) where Wu tell's Marsani that the dinosaurs have never been natural, and exclaims that nothing in Jurassic World is natural, or has ever been natural, after Wu is criticized for creating the Indominus Rex. Wu also mentions how opportunities could've been taken to create more pure (feathered) dinosaurs, but say's that not what corporate wanted. This scene was probably my favorite in the entire film, as it actually had something to say about the genetics part of these dinosaurs, and the problem with mixing different species together. Sadly the film never delves into it's own ideas, and doesn't have much to say about them. While I enjoyed Jake Johnson, and B.D. Wong's characters they serve as minor characters, and have little impact in the film itself. Instead the film focuses much of it's time on two kid siblings, who are not all that interesting, and frankly not needed in the film. Perhaps that is what's most frustrating about Jurassic World, it focuses much of it's time on unneeded characters/subplots, and doesn't really explore the new ideas presented. Owen (Pratt), and his raptors represent how humans, and wild (dangerous) animals can cooperate, but in Jurassic World there's little indication as to why this bond exists. Instead of exploring it, we get Pratt saying the bond is ""based on mutual trust"", while that may be true, it doesn't feel all that interesting, which is a constant issue in this film. The new ideas presented are simply that ""ideas"", which are sidelined for dinosaur (monster) action especially near the end.Jurassic World is ultimately not brought down by the dinosaurs, but by director Colin Trevorrow, and the screenwriters. This film has next to no tension, or any real build up from scene to scene, and the underdeveloped characters are probably the film's greatest undoing. Trevorrow/writers also put way too many references from the original film into Jurassic World, for nostalgia purposes, which makes you just want to watch the far better Jurassic Park film. A film can be predictable, yet fun, but having decent characters to get behind, and follow on the film's journey is essential, and Jurassic World simply didn't have any worthwhile ones. The film also relies far too heavily on CGI, and many dinosaur shots are quite unremarkable, considering what was achieved two decades ago. Admittedly the CGI looks great in some shots, namely the Indominus Rex and a handful of others, but there are several (closeup) shots that would've looked better with animatronic dinosaurs. Jurassic World will make a considerable amount of money, but how much a money a film makes doesn't always represent quality. Basically the film is just underwhelming in virtually every way, considering the time it had to be something potentially great, but it's not the first sequel in this franchise to do so, it just does it with the least amount of finesse, and craft.",Jurassic World

But with continually trying to keep corporate investors happy and customers losing interest in many of the park's attractions; the scientists use genetic manipulation and create a new dinosaur – the Indominus Rex. Quickly enough, the dinosaur escapes its captivity and is running rampant through the park, eventually heading to the thousands of unknowing customers.The film's leads Bryce Dallas Howard (a stereotypical business manager who's always authoritative) along with Chris Pratt (a clever, courageous, humorous Velociraptor trainer) are tasked to take down the creature. This is where the film falls flat, with its characters. The actors are fine in their performances, but they are clichéd and seen many times before. Even Claire's nephews portrayed by Ty Simpkins (Iron Man 3) and Nick Robinson (Melissa & Joey) are good in their respective roles, but it wasn't groundbreaking as the kids in the original Jurassic Park. Irrfan Khan (Life of Pi) has a more prominent role as the owner of Jurassic World, although a tad eccentric makes a mark in the film.Director Colin Trevorrow maintains a steady momentum as the story unfolds and uses various camera angles and shots to add a sense of intrigue, thrill and awe throughout the film. The CGI and practical effects are cutting edge and the sequences with the dinosaurs look majestic. This works well for the plot since the Indominus Rex is a ruthless predator, a scary killing machine that will have viewers jumping in their seat. The scenes with the Raptors are fantastic and definitely charming.Jurassic World is a surefire summer blockbuster – epic, loud and a thrilling roller-coaster ride. The audience is given exactly what they paid for, a spectacle of dinosaurs that is scary as well as exciting.

734,j-w-b-concepts,Could have picked a better cast,8,12 June 2015,"I am sure anyone who is a fan of the Jurassic Park series was waiting in pure anticipation for this movie to come out. I mean we needed something to restore it back to its glory of the first 2 and make us completely forget the 3rd one ever happened right? Given the time frame between Jurassic world and the 3rd installment you would figure this would be the summers huge block buster master piece that would have everyone talking. Coming into this movie being a 90's kid who grew up loving everything related to Jurassic park I had very high expectations. Give me that bit of nostalgia and make me feel like a kid again is all I really wanted. The only thing I feared coming into this movie was the cast, and probably the extreme over use of CGI effects. The Movie itself delivered with a great story picking up 22years after the incident that happened at Jurassic Park. We saw the bad guys of Ingen return and even got a glimpse at some 1990's Jurassic park references to tie everything together, but damn this poorly picked cast. At no point to you get emotionally attached to anyone, and Chris Pratt, for the love of God why Chris Pratt! His character just seemed so forced and all I could think of was Star Lord with his cheesy one liners. I know they wanted to separate this a little from the first 3, but I would have much rather seen some old cast and crew, or at least a cast that fit the part. The only other thing that bothered me was the over use of CGI. This is Jurassic park we are talking about where they had animatronics in the 90's that looked more real than some of the special effects. Don't get me wrong the experience was great, especially in IMAX 3D, but I would have loved some old school movie magic scattered in there a little more than what they actually had.

The visuals are great and the cast is brilliant. Chris Pratt continues to outdo himself. The plot focuses on a new hybrid dinosaur revealed at Jurassic World.

740,mlunsworth,A World of Fun,7,20 June 2015,"Jurassic Park was a masterpiece. Not just because Steven Spielberg was at the heart of it, but because it re-defined the blockbuster and was the benchmark for all CGI films since. I was a huge fan of the first film, and some aspects of the second (let's not talk about the third), so for me this fourth instalment had to reflect back to its roots yet cater for today's audience, whilst still being fun and exciting at the same time. The anticipation for this was huge, a must see film of 2015, and thankfully it didn't disappoint, but it was by no means perfect.The plot is basic. Dr Hammond's (the late great Richard Attenborough) vision of a dinosaur theme park is now a reality. They make a genetically modified dinosaur. The dinosaur escapes. All hell breaks loose. Simple. Sadly the script won't win an Oscar anytime soon, but it's woven through so the narrative structure gets us right to the action and scares as soon as possible.Colin Trevorrow (fairly new at this game) directs, and pays homage to the original in a nice way with subtle references, and a rather nostalgic nod mid-way, revealing some familiar props used in the first film - it makes the 'kid' bit come right out again. And what can we say about the so called (rumoured) Indiana Jones that is Chris Pratt? Highly watchable, and just about gets through his role as the park's answer to Dr Dolittle. (Look out for Raptors with blue-tooth headsets). Even the return of the T-Rex for the film's climax will satisfy fans to the very ending shot. And not forgetting that immense soundtrack, which is dished out in all the right places, most notably, the first establishing shot of the theme park, executed very well from a hotel window. Having said all this, it's by no means original or inventive, and the characters are very clichéd and cheesy, and it does feel like all the deleted scenes from the original trilogy rolled into one film. It's entertaining, but not amazing.A reinvented thrill ride that will please all fans of the original, and once again just look in awe at those amazing special effects.

And I'm afraid I'm not inclined to thinking it was intentional.As ridiculous as the premise of the film is – fill Dino Island with people, let a number of scary ones loose, and then indulge in blood and screams and make sure the obligatory two lead kids get away in the end, where on Earth have we seen that before? – as poorly written the script is. Apparently, the first draft only took three weeks to throw together. I'm surprised it didn't happen in three hours. Loose ends are dangling all over the place like severed sinews from consumed tourists, the archetypal characters are nothing but a poor joke of the ones in the original trilogy (geeky and untidy computer nerd, lone hero scientist who understands that life doesn't follow spreadsheets, greedy business execs who want to make money from the monsters, and lo and behold, the Nasty Military Man who wants to weaponise them, et cetera ad nauseam), and when characters actually have to TELL each other to ""RUUUUUUUN!"" instead of standing still, waiting to become a quick snack, palm goes firmly on face, at least for this reviewer.You're-a-sick World indeed.

I wish it had more impact but it was still a good film. Pros: Nice well paced , Decent acting (kids aren't annoying as some people feared, they did a good job), Funny (nice small jokes not overly done), Lot of Dino's, Nostalgia feels, Visuals/beautiful scenes Cons: Slightly on the predictable side, More of an action ride than an adventure ride, some characters needed more screen time than othersRecommendation: Watch in IMAX, Don't watch the TV spots as they show most of the scenes Rating 8/10 (over all)(If JP1 was 10/10 and number 1/10 would be JP3)",Jurassic World
743,K_ash10,Welcome to the Park,10,30 November 2015,"It's been awhile I think that I have labeled a film ""a thrill ride"" but seriously though this film was a real thrill ride. It takes place about twenty years after the events of the first film. There is now a functioning theme park on the original island. They get thousands of guest and they have tons of money making attractions. But then the people who run the park get a little greedy wanting to make more money and bring in more people so they create a new attraction, one that is more dangerous and scarier then the T-Rex. This film was fantastic. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard lead this film very well almost as a good as Sam Neill and Laura Dern did in the first film. The kids as well Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins did a good job. Colin Trevorrow also was a great choice to helm this film and he did a fantastic job directing. Now yes this film was a sequel and a great one at that. It's been a long time since I have felt that a sequel is just as good as its original. This film to me is really good and just as good as the first film. The special effects were great and one of the best parts was the music. I have been a Jurassic Park fan since I was a little kid and this is actually the first of franchise that I have seen in theaters as well. So this was definitely an amazing experience for me and hearing that original score in this film literally gave me goosebumps.",Jurassic World
744,manosnb,Uninspiring at best..,5,17 February 2016,"I have many times wondered if the first Jurassic Park seemed so good to me the first time I watched because I was a kid and easily excited or because it was fundamentally good for every audience. I think that partially both reasoning are true. However, I am sure about one thing. Jurassic World would not receive a grade higher than 7 even from my child-self. Very predictable, less thrilling than the originals and the concept of genetically enhanced new species of dinosaurs ruined the original and unique touch of the first movies. If anybody wants to watch a monster movie I am sure there are more than plenty to choose. The only good thing about this film for me was the nostalgia felt in some scenes and the beautiful old soundtrack playing again. But that was pretty standard to expect, wasn't it?",Jurassic World
745,rkoch1,Unrealistic and a Horrible Mess,1,25 February 2016,"Let me just start by saying, I don't think this movie deserves a score of 1, but I had to rank it that low because currently the score is a gross misrepresentation of reality. This is not a movie which deserves to be compared with all of the great cinema masterpieces mankind has made.I just watched the semi-new Jurassic Park movie and I must say, I thought it was very, very stupid. I hate the trend in modern movies where everything bad that happens is always caused by people being stupid and doing stupid things. Like literally people making 10-20 Darwin Award ideas every movie. Literally in this movie, there is a big ""Super T-Rex"" dinosaur which is running around, and someone thinks that the proper move is to release a bunch of smaller Raptors to go hunt it down... like... what the hell...? You MUST be kidding. Raptors are PREY for T-Rex. It is a smaller predator which presents ZERO threat to the T-Rex, but MAXIMUM threat to humans. No human being who doesn't have a permanent retard helmet strapped to their head would have ever made that ""executive decision"". That's as stupid as sending a bunch of hunting dogs to go kill a Lion which is on the loose. Or a bear or something. And we are all little furry bunnies or something, so the dogs could easily just kill us for fun anyways. It is obvious that Raptors are only effective at killing small, human-sized prey... it just makes no sense. It is nothing but FRUSTRATING for the viewer, we're sitting here frowning and saying to ourselves, ""nobody would EVER do that!"".Anyways, MAJOR PLOT decision by the producing team... and it was a total disaster.. They should have gone back to the white board and came up with another plot idea.Another thing I hate are those STUPID ANNOYING scenes where everyone is running and frantically screaming in fear all around you, but the main characters are just standing there talking to each other like nothing is going on, just having a little chit-chat while there's dinosaurs running around, and people dying. Or when the two boys were running away from the T-Rex and then they got to the edge of a waterfall, but instead of jumping without hesitation like any normal person who is about to die would have done, they turn to each other and say ""Are you ready to jump? Let's do it together, OK? On the count of three, one... two... THREE, JUMP!"" Seriously, F that scene. That sh*t pisses me off so much.Stuff like that just makes a movie seem silly and stupid to me. I can't get ""drawn in"" where I feel the tension, and feel like I'm right there experiencing the adventure with the characters. Instead, I'm constantly reminded that I'm watching the product of mega-producers and corporations, who think the general population is only interested in special effects and explosions and beautiful people saying stupid lines. I remember watching the first movie, and as the final scene was closing and they were flying away from the island, I breathed a heavy sigh of relief, because I felt like I had JUST BARELY escaped the same dangers as the main characters had. I felt like I was there the whole time. But when I finished the newer, more ""modern"" JURASSIC WORLD, I felt zero emotion, absolutely nothing as the movie was ending. Instead, I just thought to myself ""Well, those were some really cool special effects, the movie sure had a large budget!"" In order for a movie to be captivating and really give the viewers a unique experience, you must mesmerize them and put them in a trance where they forget they are watching a movie. All those STUPID, HORRIBLY UNREALISTIC lines, actions, and mistakes made by the cast throughout the entire movie do nothing but slap me on the face each time it happens, only to remind me that I am, in fact, watching a movie.I would watch the first original Jurassic Park movie 10 times before I watch Jurassic World again! >:[",Jurassic World

Let's hope this is the last one in the series. I didn't even bother to check if it is because I wouldn't watch it anyway.Some scenes were awesome. Some, like when the birds escape, are moronic. The ""hero"" saves the day by shooting down a few birds. Then the kids just stand out in the open while other birds fly nearby. So stupid.

This movie counts with new species of dinosaurs and a majority of species we already know well from it's prequels. Colin Trevorrow might not have had the same attention to small details like our beloved Steven Spielberg had in the caption of all the magic there is in this amazing dinosaur park...but he did a fine job by bringing up a little of the past story in short cuts of pure nostalgic. Chris Pratt also did a great job as the main character in this movie, as a Jurassic Park fan, he knew how to pass this adventurer's aspect which reminded me a lot of what Sam Neill brought to us as Dr. Alan Grant, 22 years ago. In overall this movie deserves to be in your list of must see's before death. It contains drama, adventure, action, comedy and of course...dinosaurs, a lot of them! So what are you waiting for?

No surprises with the characters either - they are exactly what you think they'll be. Dialogue is OK - a couple of clever bits which don't go anywhere and don't seem as connected to the overall narrative as the original JP and a couple of really dumb, disjointed bits to balance it out.Dino effects - that's what everyone sees these for anyway - are good but more about wow than accuracy.

As the time passes on, the visuals get more artistic and realistic. This trilogy series never wears out it's welcome, I wonder what they will think of next Jurassic Space? I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens. The CGI gets better as the years go on and it successfully replicates and in some ways improves the behaviours of the dinosaurs when they react with humans with the dinosaurs violent behaviours sure to thrill the entire audience!",Jurassic World
753,billosaurus,"The most action-packed entry in the series, but far less intelligent.",7,6 January 2016,"OK, this movie is in the right for calling itself Jurassic world and not Jurassic park, as its tone is very different. Unlike the quiet, thoughtful, and suspense filled park series, Jurassic world is a break-neck paced action film, and the sense of wonder is also glossed over.The emotional scenes are forced, there is a rushed romance, and a shoe-horned in divorce for the mandatory children in the move.(this movie didn't really need kids in it.) It is an amazing spectacle, that has a few thrown in, rushed through 'clever' moments, and exposition, but once that's out of the way, it plunges into insane, almost cartoon-like action, with poorly rendered dinosaurs doing over-the-top-things. The effects are weird, the cgi looking real in some shots and fake in others, and the dinosaur character models look odd, as all the dinosaurs have big feet, big heads, and just look like 3-d cartoons, especially in the case of the tyrannosaurs. The only time they look real is when the brontosaurus dies as they used a robotic dinosaur. In its credit, there are some cool concepts in this movie, such as dinosaurs imprinting on people, and the new attraction, a genetically engineered hybrid created to boost popularity, has an interesting back-story, although once it breaks loose it just behaves like a generic movie monster and attacks everything in sight. It is also a nerdy nit-pick of mine, but the dinosaurs, from a scientific point of view are all hideous, deformed monstrosities, especially in the case of the small meat-eating dinosaurs which we now know possessed feathers, and had inward facing palms, not loose zombie hands.But in this movies credit, it does state the cloned dinosaurs are mixed with other animals DNA making them look different, but it would have been cooler if the park cloned purer dinosaurs resembling the real deal.But all in all, this movie is good fun, the dinosaurs have a lot of personality, are still sweet and likable, Chris Pratt is affable, Claire is basically bones from bones. The climax, which i won't give away, is amazingly over-the-top.",Jurassic World
754,supertrunks2,LOL it's not even comparable to the garbage out on your lawn,1,15 July 2016,"Literally I think I could plug in some cables into a old piece of paper that annoyingly blew its way onto your property or a dirty moldy pop can and have more fun trying to play that than endure this painful movie.I was feeling all kinds of things like leg cramps, leg dryness (hard to explain what that is, it's not a skin thing), lack of blood flow in me, dizzy feelings that tingle in the thigh when I was watching this. It's like, imagine you have a flow of energy in a circuit. If you like disrupt it, then the flow doesn't work right? We have a flow that is satisfied by the movies we watch, and when that flow SUCKS, our bodies begin to shut down because they're not working circuits. Your legs keep fidgeting because you're bored, your breathing becomes difficult, all in all it felt crap to see this. Makes me wonder if you can even hold them responsible for making such atrocious cinema, because seriously I even had stomach problems after seeing it.Or maybe that's because I see too much Jurassic Park in youth and was let down so I got like sick or something...but anyway! Know that I'm one of the biggest fans ever to exist of Jurassic Park. I had all the cool toys, everything. Charts showing the dinosaur sizes, video games, and all from the cool era back then. None of this J world filth. Real old school Lost World and JP3 stuff. So if there were anyone to have review this movie, it's me (and of course the other fans out there too).It sucked right from beginning to end, the dinosaurs are reduced to annoying playthings, like literally it's not like ""oh that raptor is scary"", it's more like ""that raptor is annoying, like that kid who keeps going number two on your lawn"". It all reeks of annoying things. It's sad, it's not even like it's disturbing like Saw or Texas Chainsaw Massacre or something, it's just annoying.Dinos are not these creatures you can turn into graphic barbie showcase things with the ugly kids riding them and ugly kids going to see them in a park. They're noble beings, full of power and majesty. LISTEN TO JOHN HAMMOND AND MALCOLM IN THE 2ND MOVIE FOR Christ SAKES, the creatures need our ABSENCE, and that includes the makers in our world that try to make (*cough* steal 1990's filmmakers ideas) stories and CG models out of them. They all look like they've been animated by selfish people, a loving CG artist makes even the cruddiest of 3D modelia shine with life. It's just a matter of a simple loving touch, that's what makes CG great (I know from some experience with CG). This movie had none of that. So sorry, the dinosaurs don't make you drool with immense urges to draw and colour them in all day, to have complex dioramas with your toys, it makes it worse than a street dog in your head. Just some ""oh look tommy, there's an annoying dino, go pet him"".Our dinos before had vicious survival based lives and they were as great as seeing your own mother and father when they came on screen. They marched in and ran the show, they were precious. The roars still fill my ears when I sleep at night.All the intro garbage crap with the kids and the dumb texting girlfriend nonsense, you put that in a kids movie? Seriously? That's when you know never to trust ANYTHING from this film company again, they're frauds. There was even a VERY big hint at a nude subject in the movie which I won't dare discuss. People are swearing left and right, like jeez you think the small words aren't swear words? You think our beloved Jurassic trilogy has language like that? You clearly don't know what a kid friendly movie is. Don't take your kids to see this, it's not worth it.The dinosaurs are all trying too hard to be cool, and YES I do treat the dinosaurs as their own creatures even through the screen because they were amazing enough to receive that treatment in the 3 movies. All the personifying of the dinos making them into more things for humans to control is annoying. Like a dinosaur movie isn't about them helping each other beat the bad dino like humans would, these makers are trying to make them like humans. These animals work alone and look like REAL animals when they think. YES, they can be friends but it has a different feel. It felt more like pixar creature love than anything.

'Jurassic World' reminded me of 'Martian' – episodes that should have had tense and thrill are dumbed down with jokes and humour. It feels like nobody is ever scared. There is not a single moment in the movie when you are actually afraid for any of the characters.It's a perfect, cheesy, Disney-style commercial movie. All relevant deaths can be counted using fingers of one hand, and thorough preparations (justifications for their deaths) have been included in the script. If somebody dies – you have been shown multiple times that this was a bad person. No good guy gets spared, basically.

761,Starbuck823,Nostalgia can't cover many plot and scripting holes,5,18 June 2015,"Personally, I am baffled as to why this has gotten such positive reviews. I never expected it to be better than the first film but I didn't think it would be so far below it.The film aims to pay homage to the first. So much so, I found myself rolling my eyes by the second half of the movie with how many shots echo the first film. In fact, by the end I was annoyed that it pretty much ripped off the whole first film and didn't have the decency to do it well. Within the first film, there was a large amount of tension. You really felt like the main characters were in danger and felt scared. But in this film I did not believe that any main characters were in danger even though they were depicted as such. For a film that has lots of 'scary moments' I really didn't feel any tension and you could tell straight away who was going to be dino chow. Yes, I am making lots of comparisons with the first film however it echos it so much you can't help but do so. There are some positives of the film - It is cool to finally see the park in action and thriving. Having the John Williams theme within the film does create the nostalgia and feeling of continuity. CGI in most parts is good though I found the CGI textures look too shinny - the first used real props which made the textures look more real.Now for some major issues of the film. Seriously, the most plausible part of this movie is actually creating the dinosaurs.The characters act in the most stereotyped way it's ridiculous. The brothers - texting teenager who checks out every girl (even though he has a girlfriend) and the younger but super smart one who is scared for their parents divorcing. The 'villian' and his motives for using the dinosaurs. His actions throughout the movie were so predictable it was laughable.The male and female leads. Possibly the worst scripting for the female lead - Laura Dern's character was smart and believable. Bryce Dallas-Howards part was so one dimensional it wasn't even plausible for her transition from uptight CEO to searching the jungle for the kids to shooting dinos. Oh and all in a white pant suit and high heels!!! Then we have Chris Pratt. Really, raptor wrangling??? Come on, the first film made them scary and gives no plausibility that human interaction would be possible beyond being their meal. Now we have Chris Pratt jumping in there being the raptor whisperer. Please!! And there are some serious plot holes that are in effect to keep the film rolling. First, we have a large resort with dangerous animals and situated in a tropical cyclone area. How is there NOT a proper evacuation protocol in place other than mustering people into the one congregated space where the dangerous animals can enjoy a buffet. Then there is the supercharged Rex. Who has these abilities that allowed her to escape her enclosure then never uses them again. Oh and this enclosure has smaller walls than she is high, so that totally makes sense. And the Gyrospheres - why would there not be an auto-recall function for safety purposes? And taking the sphere for a ride off road after an evacuation call AND through a suspiciously torn gate seems like a great idea. Eye rolling was occurring frequently after this point. Overall, I was strongly disappointed with the film. It had great potential to be equal to the first but fell far below. But since it's done so well in the box office, it seems I am in the minority of my views.",Jurassic World
762,blaskofilms,Monstrous Mistakes Make JW a Complete Disaster for JP Fans,2,12 June 2015,"What a shame, and a waste. If you loved Jurassic Park, you could skip Colin Trevorrow's mishmash sequel/reboot. In fact, you should skip it. What made the first Jurassic Park (even the two sequels, really) work so well is that Steven Spielberg clearly decided not to make a monster movie. Genetically engineered or not, the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park were living animals, skillfully brought to life with personality and gait, pace and vigor. They were neither heroes nor villains. Get in front of them and you're in trouble, get behind them and watch in awe. They, like all wild animals, were dangerous if you didn't respect or understand them, but they were also entirely capable of all the other things living creatures do: resting, rearing young, hunting, etc. The dinosaurs of Jurassic World? The film can't quite decide. Characters pay lip service to the idea that they are complex, living creatures, but on screen they're ultimately little more than toothy action figures, placed clumsily into scenes to bonk around gyrospheres, bite the bad guy or rumble against one another. They don't behave the way animals would behave, nothing they do confounds, intrigues or surprises. Instead, the little monsters snap and slash and are completely tamed by Trevorrow's limited vision, doing exactly what he and the scriptwriters want them to do -- exactly what the audience expects.And that might have even been okay, if only it had been a good script. It's not. Nostalgic touches intended to link the film thematically to the franchise only serve to remind us that a better film was made out of this material over two decades ago. The relationship between characters is wafer thin and, even from the start, stale. There is absolutely no chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, at least partially because Howard is forced into a prehistorically sexist role as corporate yes woman/damsel in distress. And yet, even when she transforms into an action hero and rescues Pratt from a flying reptile attack, her nephews ignore her completely, championing Pratt as a ""bad ass"" and their chosen hero of the film. The villain of the show, played by a husky Vincent D'onofrio, is even less interesting, chewing out his motives for a dino military force in a constant stream of GI Joe-meets-Halliburton chatter. His exit is absurdly staged, and serves as a marker for when the film is going downhill at full speed. I won't give away the ending. I don't need to -- everyone in the theater knew exactly what was coming. It's a wreck of CGI and pyrotechnics, insulting to the eye and ear. It clearly was meant to honor the titans of the original Jurassic Park, but it ends up being a poor kind of parody. I found myself wishing that all of the creatures involved could have just been put down, and met a more humane ending than the one they're left with: the prospect of more of this kind of franchise re-engineering to come.",Jurassic World

764,rockchester,Middling sequel,5,7 July 2015,"I was neither surprised nor disappointed by Jurassic World. It's very well done, no question. However, as with most sequels, it doesn't have that certain something that the original had. It does, however, have the formula that made the original so good. Therefore, the entire movie is largely predictable. We know who will be eaten, we know that the kids will end up out in the field with the dinosaurs, we know that the male and female (adult) leads will go off in to the sunset together even though there's friction in the beginning, and on and on and on...YAWN.The one thing that the movie DID have that was worthwhile, I guess, was that Owen knew how to treat the raptors with respect and bond with them. That was the overriding message and they maintained it very well. Good moral message. Let the bad guy be the decoy and get eaten while you sneak out of the room, but, treat the animals like your buds. Got it.There were some gems, of course. The final dino battle was good and had an interesting twist. I particularly liked how the T-Rex regarded the raptor as a kind of comrade in arms and then walked away. Nice touch, that. I half expected some kind of goofy love story to spring from it, and am glad that it took the high road, so to speak.All in all, it's a worthy effort with some fun twists and turns that can derail the predictability at times. Ideally, if you were a kid when the original came out and now have kids of your own, then you'll have a great time because you'll know when you can leave to go to the bathroom (yes, it's that predictable) but the kids will be mesmerized by the dinosaurs. Win-win.",Jurassic World

766,gazmar62,Back to the Jurassic world,8,11 June 2015,"I was surprised to hear this movie was coming to the big screen considering how disappointing the last outing Jurassic Park 3 was. My recommendation is that if you haven't seen any of the original 3 movies (unlikely but possible ?) don't be tempted to now, watch this and it will be all the more enjoyable, well they say ignorance is bliss ! Of course you probably have seen the original and best film from 1993 and even the still very enjoyable JP2 of 1997 which this film compares favourably to. It is leaps and bounds better than JP3 of 2001 which was inevitable because that film was scraping the barrel for ideas. The CGI has improved quite a bit and that is where the money has been spent I guess (another £100 000 000 film !) with the added bonus of 3D which I thought was really good. OK the story is obviously predictable , we aren't expecting all the dinosaurs to stay in their pens and behave themselves are we !? The newish ideas come in the form that we have trained the dinos to be more entertaining a bit like sea-world and for that extra wow factor that is of course needed we have a new chimera of a dinosaur in Indominus-rex a real badass monster who inevitably runs amok. There are some funny and romantic moments dropped in here and there and of course the baddies in the background with their own agendas for the dinosaurs. Chris Pratt shows us again how entertaining he can be as the action hero and will obviously be doing more comedy action in future. BD Wong is again the scientist from the original 1993 film, it would have been nice to see Sam Neil but you can't have everything ,maybe JP3 scared him or should I say scarred him ? Anyway ,if you want to see an action packed entertaining big blockbuster of a movie go and see Mad Max Fury Road, if you want to see an entertaining action movie about dinosaurs , Jurassic World is a good option.",Jurassic World
767,olissao-582-902688,Disappointing dino,5,15 June 2015,"I love the original Jurassic Park and I will still watch the sequels. I have been looking forward to this addition since I very first heard rumors of its arrival. I have been waiting years. All that being said, I was disappointed after such anticipation. I suppose if I had never watched the first one I might be more pleased with this one, but I doubt anything will ever make me feel like the first one did. In 1993, it was like nothing else of its time.I did appreciate some of the nods to the original, such as the DNA cartoon that the children were interacting with and the mosquito in the large amber rock that Chris Pratt hides behind in the final action scene. There were countless others, to the point that it started to seem like the old dog doing the same tricks. The kids get the hamster ball ride dropped on them after they get out of it, which was strikingly familiar to the scene in the first movie where Dr. Grant and Tim get out of the car, then it falls on them but they do not get crushed because of the open roof. They're looking up through the glass and you see the eye of the dino just like the kids did the T rex in the first movie. All that aside, the plot was weak and some of it was down right cheesy, here in no particular order:-Owen and Claire's relationship/interaction is cheesy and predictable. -The fact that Owen supposedly has these raptors trained to be loyal to him, respect him, and obey his commands is preposterous and another reason I say cheesy. -At one point the younger nephew starts blubbering about his parents getting a divorce. It was totally pointless to the rest of the movie. Nothing about the parents interactions in the beginning led anyone to believe there was turmoil or upheaval in the household. At one point I thought, OK, the parents sent the kids down to the park with her sister so they wouldn't be present during a messy divorce hearing or something. At one point the mom is talking on the phone outside of a meeting but it didn't give us enough information to let us in on if this was her job or the divorce meeting. The entire movie could have done without that information and would not have been affected. -Dr. Wu ends up being not entirely a villain, but not entirely portrayed in a positive light either and that was a major disappointment for me. It was like he sold out or something. I love BD Wong and I love his characters and it bothered me. -Claire's hair looks like a wig. -Owen's motorcycle is apparently an all terrain vehicle, which I think someone else mentioned in a review.-A lot of the stuff to do with this genetically engineered dinosaur did not add up. I will say I think the franchise has been building up to this super raptor idea for a long time. Most people always considered the T rex to be the ultimate predator, but after watching Jurassic Park, our eyes were opened to this new dinosaur, the raptor. While not as large as the T Rex, she is to be feared and respected because of her cunning and fierceness. This new monster's vision is not based on movement like the T Rex, yet on several occasions, like when Owen and Claire hid behind the jeep, they stay real still like that will make a difference. If her vision is based on thermal energy, she would have noticed them. And they did not feed the new dino live animals, which unless they freshly slaughtered the steer they drop to attract him, she wouldn't be enticed by that side of beef. The T Rex got live food because his vision is based on movement. the Idominus Rex should have been fed live food because her vision is based on warmth. Just a theory. -It was silly at the end of the movie how the raptor and the T Rex looked at each other like they had come to some understanding over eliminating the Idominus Rex. Even more so that the water dinosaur hopped out of the barrier and dealt the final blow. I know teenagers are difficult, but really. If you are in a ride that involved large unbridled prehistoric animals and they call it back and then seconds later your aunt that runs the park calls you in a panic, would you not maybe consider going back? -Hoskins insisted on using the raptors to fight the super monster, which had to happen for the sake of the movie to happen, but really? That thing was huge and was hunting them. Did they really need to use the raptors like blood hounds to find it? And the raptors were so small they were no match for that thing anyway. They could have just as reasonably dropped a missile or rocket or whatever they originally suggested just as easily and not involved the raptors at all.",Jurassic World

There is no point, this is a different movie entirely. Chris Pratt is brilliant in this film as the hero with some brilliant support from Bryce and the kids. Yes, the story is a bit weak. Yes, it's a bit cliché. Yes, it's cheesy. But it's also good fun! Plenty of adrenaline, the dinosaurs are brilliant and the effects are spot on as usual. There are plenty of heart stopping moments but some comic moments too for a bit of relief. I've always loved dinosaur movies and this is no exception. Don't watch it trying to compare it, just go along for the ride and enjoy it!",Jurassic World
769,TheLastBaronW,More ham than a Christmas dinner,3,12 June 2015,"Keeping in mind the first the Jurassic series entries, I read the reviews on IMDb before going to see this turkey and was amazed that so many people thought it was so brilliant. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio called in their performances, resulting in some of the most shallow, I- couldn't-give-a-damn characters on screen. Whether that's what Colin Trevorrow was aiming for I don't know, but considering the hokey performances from Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Judy Greer and BD Wong, one has to assume he was aiming for the lowest common denominator and the shallow end of the pool.A wholly uninspired cast sleepwalks its way through a monotonous, boring plot underscored by bombastic music more worthy of a made- for-cable production than a supposed blockbuster. The only bright note throughout the entire ordeal is a praiseworthy performance delivered by Irrfan Khan as the big boss of Jurassic World, the be all, end all of unrealistic theme parks - think Disney World on steroids with live dinosaurs instead of animatronic ones.The opening is a family scene with a desperately clutchy mother, Judy Greer, saying goodbye to her little darlings going on an unaccompanied trip to La Isla I Don't Care to go see the dinosaurs, where the big bad theme park is conveniently run by her flibbertigibbet sister, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. All the emotions throughout the film seem hackneyed and either totally over the top or so shallow that your feet wouldn't even get properly wet.Once we see Jurassic World, we are introduced in quick succession to Chris Pratt playing a character he apparently based on a combination of Crocodile Dundee, Indiana Jones and any number of other hokey jungle-style macho misogynists.The naughty brothers played by Simpkins and Robinson ditch their (naturally) British nanny, and thanks to aunty's VIP passes for them are the last on a ridiculous theme park ride just as the big bad lab-concocted supersaurus escapes and begins to eat and terrorize everyone in sight.The resulting hunt and chase scenes, complete with cheesy oeuvres by D'Onofrio playing an InGen madman wanting to use the dinosaurs as soldiers of the future for the U.S. army, are at times hilarious enough to wonder if the entire cast had a parody in mind, and at other times so stunningly poorly acted that I assume multiple retakes were necessary and everyone's collective spirit flagged to the point of ""let's just get it over with.""Another point leading to the conclusion that this was intended as parody is the fact that the theme park - oh so closely based on Disney World and targeting the same lolling tourist audiences - was completely devoid of the average profile theme park visitor - the overweight American. All the visitors to Jurassic World are beautiful people who do not at all look like the regular theme park crowd and make it more like a EuroDisney with giant lizards.The dinosaurs themselves, the CG and blue screen techniques used are noteworthy and fun at times, sometimes predictably boring and inane.There were a number of (most likely unintentional) belly laughs throughout, just as the plot was so utterly predictable as to be totally uninspiring; the phrase ""mind-numbingly mundane"" springs to mind...If you are looking for anything like Oscar-worthy performances or an unforgettable story-line, skip this film. If technology and blue screen stunts are your bag, then you'll like this film. Don't expect anything more than pretty low- grade B-Film acting, writing, direction and execution here.",Jurassic World
770,IsaacSage,3.25/5,6,8 December 2015,"Here we are again. In the year of studio attempts to re-vitalize dead sci-fi franchises, it's Jurassic Park's turn. We all know how most of these types of films turn out(Mad Max excluded.) It's rare when the fan base of a film embraces one of these. They've got greed, marketing, and goals to make it big overseas all over them. So it's up to the director and the writer to try and get around it, to get their vision worked into to something that is the closest thing to a manufactured product in the movie industry. With this film, director Colin Trevorrow(Safety Not Guaranteed) has tried to turn it into a ""meta"" joke. Constant references to how ""the old park was cooler"" or how ""these dinosaurs are becoming products"" are funny when they work, and a little painful when they don't. And that's basically the movie. When it works, it re-captures, if not Spielbergian wonder, at least early Michael Bay. When it doesn't, it feels more like late Michael Bay. In the film, Jurassic World is a national sensation, and they are trying to boost their sales by making a ""new dinosaur."" In the indominus Rex. The head of all this is a caricature of a working woman, who is super-organized, not married, and bad with kids(a worn out cliché we've seen a thousand times.) She's played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who's fine, though she's not given much. When said dinosaur escapes, she teams up with a sexy man with huge abs that's basically good at everything. This caricature of a male hero is played by Chris Pratt. He's definitely the joy of the movie. His lines are the funniest, hit the hardest, and made me wish I was watching Guardians 2. To further complicate things, Dallas Howard's two nephews are also in the park. One is really horny and the other is sad about his parents divorce. A representative from Ingen(Vincent D'Onofrio) is trying to buy velociraptors for war in the middle east. That actually happens. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is asinine, and when Dallas Howard breaks down and cries over a dead dinosaur when she's just watch 10 humans get brutally murdered, I lost all hope for a return to form for the franchise. There's also the matter of the child performances. It's safe to say that most sitcoms get better kid actors nowadays. But, on the positive side of things, the film looks great, and the action is shot well. That in itself is a revelation. When Pterodactyls fly over a screaming crowd, when a giant sea monster eats a shark, when the indominus Rex attacks, it feels like a real blockbuster. In one scene, an assistant suffers a prolonged demise at the hands of several dinosaurs. It's easily the best scene in the film. It feels like the original, when a greedy lawyer met his end in a prolonged sequence inside a bathroom stall. Like I said, a lot of the self-referential jokes actually work, and add a bit of depth to this otherwise childishly shallow affair. Honestly, ""Jurassic World"" isn't terrible, but it's certainly not good either. It's a bit of a mess, but a mess that kind of works. It's just okay, and for a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made, just okay is not good enough.",Jurassic World
771,peterchapman-76310,Not quite as good as the original but not bad,7,30 July 2015,"22 years is it really? 22 years since the first film was released. Another theme park this time filled not only with original DNA dinosaurs but now they add a new twist mixing DNA to create new ones. Including a dinosaur that is bigger, scarier and more dangerous than the T-Rex. The action is fairly predictable, I just didn't really click with the characters, but it sucked me in non the less just to see what would actually happen.If your hoping for something as good as the original, its not, but if you want a little more of the same but updated then its good enough.",Jurassic World

Jurassic World boasts a great cast with visuals and is directed by Colin Trevorrow, the director of the critically acclaimed movie, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"". This movie acts out the extremely predictable creation of magnum opus Jurassic World envisioned by John Hammond and the genetic splice of two dinosaurs named ""Indominous Rex"". The lack of emotion, drama, and care for characters are made up with spectacular visuals. This movie may not have the best plot or characterization, but it surely has enough teeth and fun to satisfy moviegoers. The outcome? The outcome is a perfect summer blockbuster movie that is ready to tear up the box office.Twenty-two years later, after the severe events of Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar is finally a fully functional theme park that attracts tons of visitors each day. But since the revival of T-Rex's and Pterenadon's are very old, the Director,(Bryce Dallas Howard) and the park's engineers decide to spice things up by making a genetically modified hybrid dino.Not having learnt anything at all from the last three Jurassic movies, the main characters still end up being part of the poorly written and pictured cat and mouse chase which is basically showcased in every Jurassic movie except the first one. As Bryce Dallas Howard struggles to get control of her truant nephews, Velociraptor trainer Chris Pratt, prevents his notorious security chief,(Vincent D' Onforio), from using the trained dinosaurs as weapons in case of emergency.Exiting the pre-development hell after 10 years, this beast of a film knits together the various pieces cooked up by Steven Spielberg himself, and many others. This disaster of a plot has a big enough hole for all the Avengers to jump right into another universe. This much troubled plot is also written by Colin Trevorrow's long lasting partners Derek Conelly and Rick Jaffa the writer of the amazing ""Planet Of the Apes"". One of the biggest holes is the concept itself. After the severe aftermath of Jurassic Park, how can Jurassic World even be made? Adding up to the weak plot, the TWO lost children, giant killing dinosaur, and the zero parent material concept has been repeated multitudinous times right from the Michael Crichton time. Even though Chris Pratt keeps the movie light at some points with his uneven comedy, the plot still struggles. Unlike every Steven Spielberg movie, this movie is just unable to make you care for the characters. Even though there is a some drama and emotion during the two hour run-time, there isn't enough chemistry between the characters. By the climax of the movie, you still wouldn't care about the welfare of any of the other characters. This movie wants to do a lot, but ends up doing very well in only a few things. The characterization part of the story is actually the weakest point of the film. Even though Jurassic World comes short in it's storytelling and characterization, watching it in theaters on an IMAX screen with a bag of popcorn isn't such a bad idea. The dinosaur menagerie definitely gives you enough popcorn thrills for you to be seated on the edge. But this movie lacks to some extent the nail-biting experience you probably had when you watched the original Jurassic Park. Colin is able to bring his whole dinosaur crew into action, despite it attempt for love is soulless. It's ambitious but ultimately lacks soul. Is it any good? Yes, it can be watched as extremely fun roller-coaster dinosaur ride. The Visuals, the IMAX, and the popcorn should be enough to sell yourself.",Jurassic World

777,brian-2266,Jurassic Fail,2,18 June 2015,"First let me say I am a HUGE fan of this franchise. I loved the first 3 films, and still watch them once a year or so.I've awarded this film 1 star for the effects, which, in all fairness, were some of the best ever made in any move I've ever seen.I've awarded this film another star for the humor, which, in all fairness, was successfully pulled of without Jeff Goldblum.Star #3 - #10 will forever go un-awarded. I'm not even sure where to begin. So I guess, let's start with plot.PLOT - The plot was almost identical to Jurassic Park. Updated for a new audience that demands more action, but the same plot nonetheless. Even cute kids. Add to that the sheer absurdity of the plot (more on that in the ABSURDITY section) which made this movie so predictable it was hard to get to the end. At some point, even the effects and action do not make up for this.EDGEOFSEATNESS - Unlike any of the other 3 films in the franchise, not once was there a scene that kept me on the edge of my seat. In Jurassic Park, the tree scene, in #2 it was the bus on the cliff scene, and in #3 it was the bird-cage scene and the airplane scene. Not a single scene in Jurassic World had me hanging like that.ABSURDITY - Of course you go to a movie like this knowing it has no bearing at all on reality, but Jurassic World took it one step further, and took the absurdity to new levels. Any movie where humans don't generally act like humans should is hard to watch, but when most of the humans do things that NO human would do...EVER...it's absurd.1. First, our co-star ran around the island in high-heels the entire time. Through jungle, rivers, mud, and even though the shoes were mentioned by our star, SHE STILL KEEPS THEM ON. And she could run fast in those heels! 2. The Pterodactyls attack of the park patrons. Had something like this really happened, it would have been horrifying, and absolutely one of the scariest things anyone could experience. People being picked up, dropped, and torn apart by birds the size of cars. But instead of showing any true terror of this event, humor was added in an attempt to make it funny. In one scene, a man is shown hording his margaritas while running from and being whisked away by a dino-bird. This did not make it funny, it made it absurd.3. This new dinosaur they created could not be killed, and was barely maimed by bullets, RPG's, and 50cal rounds, yet, T-Rex (HERE HE COMES TO SAVE THE DAY!) was able to, with some raptor help, nearly bring this super-dino to it's knees so that super-shark could do the rest. COME ON! And, who didn't see T-Rex saving the day AGAIN? 4. There was a HUGE contradiction in the film, and I'm not sure how it was not caught before release. In the beginning of the movie, the comment is made ""We've created the largest dinosaur to ever exist"" while referring to their new super-dino. But in the end, we see that's simply not true. Super-dino-shark was obviously 2 or 3 times the size. Why wasn't the goal originally just to drive super-dino to the water to begin with? Meh! In short, I found Jurassic World simply ABSURD, lacking a plot, and honestly boring in so many ways. I can't believe the current ratings this film is getting, because when I went to see it, it was a packed house. Several people left early, and the comments I was hearing after the film were primarily negative. Hopefully I'm not just getting too old and sounding like a crotchety old man, but to me, Jurassic World was truly a let-down.",Jurassic World
778,amoscow74,Not the Jurassic Park We Needed but the One We Deserved,9,26 June 2015,"Caught Jurassic World last night and had an absolute ball. Can't believe that it's been over 20 years since the original. I remember I had just finished Camp America and was doing a bit of travelling. Jurassic Park was on at a local cinema and having loved the book I couldn't wait to see how Spielberg dealt with it.If I'm honest, I was a little underwhelmed. The way he brought the world to life was awe inspiring but I didn't love the casting of Sam Neil and I felt the whole thing was a little safe. Over time, I've come to love the movie and while the sequel was OK, I also really like the third and felt that the reappearance of Neil in the lead role was a welcome return.Last night was a completely different experience. The movie completely blew me away. I've been excited about it ever since seeing that Chris Pratt was attached and then watching a recent trailer sent my excitement sky high. I knew what I was in for. It's not about plot or story. This was going to be one hell of a roller-coaster ride.It turned out to be much more than that. It was everything I'd ever wanted from a Jurassic Park movie. Thrills, spills, tension and at it's centre, Chris Pratt doing his action guy thing. Just brilliant. Loved all the little nods to the original movie. And even the 3D was worth it. Trevorrow has shot such a beautifully vivid picture with so many bright colours that the transfer never jarred.

This movie should never have been made - and the only reason to watch it is for the special effects (yes, they ARE good) - but there is no storyline that follows through other than fighting.

It actually is a pretty enjoyable film that delivers on the thrills and chills. The film itself (like it's star predator) is a terrifying chimera of various elements from previous Jurassic Park films, books, games, and media that packs a powerful punch. The movie DEFINITELY knew it's audience and delivers on mostly all the right notes. That's not to say there were some things that were either missed opportunities or made me roll my eyes, with the biggest cringe-factor being Jimmy Fallon's annoying and unnecessary cameos. I just really wished they used more practical effects and animatitronics like the past films, one factor that even Jurassic Park 3 had a leg up over this film. The pacing also seemed a little too rushed and fast in many areas, and John Williams' scores are heavily missed as well as Stan Winston's hyper-realistic creations. It is too bad this film couldn't of been made back in the 90's or early 2000's back when such things were still appreciated by film makers and studios.

We can watch that movie and ignore the fact that Hammond spares no expense in everything, but hires one man to write all the code. We ignore these things because the special effects in that film, hold up to this day. The feeling of terror during the T-Rex reveal scene, still holds up. We forgive the fact that it's not a perfect film logically, because it's still a perfect film technically and emotionally.There's no way of topping the first film. Spielberg couldn't even do it himself with The Lost World, you just can't recapture that nostalgia, and to expect that much of THIS movie is pretty asinine...the best it can do is be it's own clever film that still respects the original.That being said, the film comes pretty dang close. It's probably the most entertaining Jurassic Park sequel thus far. It's not overly stupid like the third film, and not overly preachy and emotionless like the second film. Instead it's just kind of stuck in the middle. There are MANY of good things in this film, but SO MANY missed opportunities.The actors do a good job. Chris Pratt is pretty much just playing Chris Pratt. Vincent D'onfrio is a decent dumb bad-guy. The brothers get a few good scenes and prove to be somewhat capable actors. Surprisingly the best character is Bryce Dallas Howard, she's still a stereotypical character like the others. But at least she goes through some form of an emotional arc throughout the story. She's pretty much the Alan Grant of this film, the only character that changes during the movie. The other characters are pretty much just there to help that character to survive.The big missed opportunity with the film, is the special effects. They're god-awful. Apparently they used animatronics on set, but the entire film looks fake. All the dinosaurs look like CGI cartoons. I'm guessing they ""polished"" the animatronics to make it look more realistic....it didn't. It just looks like the actors are responding to air.So the film failed to be as technologically inventive as the original, but at least the film TRIED to be as emotionally effective. It's not just a bunch of disaster scenes with dinosaurs. It does actually stop and let the characters breath. The action doesn't even start till about half and hour into the film. Everything up to that point is letting the characters explore and showing off the park. Even when the action does start, there's still a rather sad scene with Claire and Owen and a Brontosaurus. But that's not to say there isn't a ton of cool scenes with the Dinosaurs. It does actually try to show-off the coolness of the dinosaurs. The scenes with the Mosasurus is cool, the Pteranodon attack is a blast, and the climatic battle is AMAZING!!! Such a thrill!!! I walked out of the film, satisfied. The special effects are garbage compared to the original. But the actors all do a good job with their stereotypical characters (The original had it's fair share of stereotypes), one of the characters does go through an emotional arc, it's about as logical as the original was, and the film does actually stop and breath and show off the real stars of the show, the dinosaurs.It's okay.7 out of 10",Jurassic World
784,noamoskaljov,Finally a sequel as good as Jurassic Park!,8,8 January 2017,"Now, listen. Not even Spielberg knew what to do with the sequels for Jurassic Park! And this movie nailed it! The park looks just amazing! The dinosaurs are the biggest problem in my opinion. You can tell they are CGI, and the new dinosaur, the I-Rex looks bland and boring. What this movie did good is making it a direct sequel to Jurassic Park and ignoring The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. The highlight of the film is easily the fight between the T-Rex and I-Rex, and the mosasaurus and raptors jumping in the fight.9/10. Jurassic World isn't perfect, the dinosaurs look bad, but the acting is great and concept is great. This movie is amazing and I cannot wait for the sequels to come out.",Jurassic World
785,degryse-44101,Jurassic Park all over again yet different!,9,27 November 2016,"Yep, they went and made the same mistake ALL over again, in a good way ;)It's basically Jurassic Park with a healthy dose of modern reality and futurism thrown into it. I love it!!!Of course I will always prefer the first movie of this series to any other, but this is a very worthy successor. Despite being similar to Jurassic Park to the point of nostalgia, the movie has its very own feel, yet we all recognise that same ""jurassic"" feeling that runs through all of the films of this amazing series :DAt first I wasn't too sure about the characters, because only one of them was actually the ""adventurer"" type, however we must recall that in the first film there were also a couple of very non-adventure-type characters, and that was what made the mix on the social scene so very interesting. Jurassic World possibly even increases this effect, with me as a viewer beginning to wonder when all the ""jurassic action"" is going to start taking place, it just all seems so secure, the way people are living their lives and worrying about the most trivial of things, thinking themselves so important and in control... and then of course all hell breaks loose, as it always does when the dinosaurs get out of their cages ;) Illusionary bubble of control and superiority gets thrown right out the window!I like how they've also shown a glimpse of the future of theme parks, with very futuristic-style scenery that make for a very nice contrast with the wildness of the actual island :) It also involves the theme of genetic manipulation, which notably was already present in Jurassic Park but got pushed to the sidelines in the other 2 sequels, but this film just takes up that concept again and does something entirely new and even more frightening with it!I very much like how this film actually uses the velociraptors, whose intelligence actually played a much bigger part in the original novel than it did in the original film, to their full potential! Cause what's truly scary is not just anything that's big and has sharp teeth, but the intelligence of the beast is also a very important factor... That's why you've always felt a raptor is scarier than a T-rex ;)I was expecting a bit of a rip-off, but I got an original reinterpretation of the first film, using the same old stuff we loved in that first film yet doing something new and interesting with it at the same time!!! Anyone who loved Jurassic Park should definitely see this!:D And anyone who thinks dinosaur films are old fashioned, should watch this first and then reconsider ;)",Jurassic World
786,ButterJuggets666,I'm late to the review party but here's my two cents.,2,4 March 2017,"May contain Spoilers!!!! You have been warned!!!!This has to be the most obvious cash grab I have ever seen. Spielberg!? What were you thinking!!! Have you sold out!!!It does not compare to the first one, save for much of the plot elements were copied and pasted. These Jurrasic movies seem to have some fixation on two children whose parents are getting a divorce, so they send the kids to a relative who is running a dinosaur theme park where bad things happen!!! Thats how they did it in the first movie and that is how they did it in this one just with different characters. You do not need to reimagine a film for a new generation because film is a recorded media and you can just watch the older one as many times as you want. And if you are going to reimagine a film to match the current generation -- why would you put holograms in it-- last I checked the 3d hologram was still being developed shouldn't you have just smart phones and -- well I guess it is a theme park run by a gazillionaire. Was the movie supposed to be set in the not too distant future?Chris Pratt is the only good character in my opinion in the film -- his raptor training, however, has to be the most laughable things I have ever seen -- those things should only eat your face off! The gratuitous practical effect dinosaur was nothing more than the studio throwing a crumb to the people who are demanding better special effects than this particular CGI that makes the ""Land Before Time"" characters look more realistic.Sort of Spoiler: The Indominus Rex hunted for sport -- (its got human DNA in it they don't say it in the movie but that is what I think!)But what has to be the most asinine thing in this movie -- is the ending -- the actual F*#K was Trevorrow thinking!!! I laughed on purpose in mockery when that velociraptor had a ""I'm saving the day scene"" in which it teamed up on the bad guy with the T-rex and then after killing it they regarded each other and then the T-Rex turned away and pulled a Pride Rock scene ripped straight out of the ""Lion King""!!! Remember in the original film how these animals were cold blooded killers!! How the same T-Rex would just as much bite your face off as look at you!!! The raptors in this film were completely neutered --(Well I suppose the exception being when they were actually killing people but they weren't as malevolent a presence as in the first film -- and much bluer for some reason). Were they watching one of those lost cat and dog ""Homeward Bound"" coming home movies while filming this?The Indominus Rex was the dinosaur version of a Mary Sue pulling all sorts of tricks out of its a$$ just for the plot of the movie to work. Dumb Dumb Dumb movie -- watch it as a comedy. Also overly sleek in visual style very glossy -- not rough enough -- too much blue not enough red. The animation action scenes were very showy and that removes you from the film. We are not watching a Loony Toons short, though I imagine you studio people would ruin that too. Bread and Circus.Peace to anyone reading this in 2017.",Jurassic World
787,biancazlotea,Better then expect it but...,7,16 July 2018,"First of all, like many of you, I was largely influenced by the reviews which are very harsh. Before letting the reviews guide you through the decision whether your going to watch the movie or not, give it a try. It's way better then you might think but of course there could be some disappointment. After all, no movie is perfect. I'll go with the bright side first. The acting was really good and in no way overdramatized like many are saying. The script was well written but maybe a little predictable here end there. And the dinosaurs were just phenomenal. Now what disappointed me was sorta the development of the movie. The romance between Owen and Claire just didn't really make sense. They first tell us they once went on a date, and expect us out of the blues to understand like there was another movie before this. And if they want to add romance, they should expand it. Make it more obvious there's stuff going on between them. They spend half the movie like they don't know each other and then they kiss, seriously ?! I'll make a reference from the second Jurassic world, were the same thing happens. The other thing I didn't like was its very predictable and typical ending. There's a dinosaur chasing them and they have to kill it, and once they do everyone is happy. I hope they change that in the JW 3, cause its getting a little old. Overall, the movie was great, not amazing, but great. Watch it and make your own opinion.",Jurassic World
788,excavator,Guilty pleasure,7,24 February 2016,"I wasn't sure what to think about this movie when I went to the theater to see it. I really liked the 'old' movies and since this was supposed to be right up that ally, I was excited. Also a little worried though, because if the 'old' movies, especially the first one, were so good, would Jurassic World be able to live up to those standards? The answer is yes and no. The storyline is cliché, it doesn't have the same level as innovation as Jurassic Park, the cast (in my opinion) in the original trilogy were better than the cast for Jurassic World, ... But when I saw the movie it felt like a good old dinosaur movie with lots of spectacle and providing good entertainment. I would recommend this movie if you liked the original trilogy and would like to see some more, as long as you're not expecting the same kind of amazement as Jurassic Park was 22 years ago.",Jurassic World

790,sambitmesengupta,4th one is better than the 2nd & 3rd ones,8,18 August 2020,"Jurassic World, the 4th installment of the iconic franchise actually serves quite a good dish on our plates.
Better than the 2nd film and way better than the 3rd one, this movie might not feel like what Jurassic Park gave us but it still the best one after the original 1993 film, till date.
A complete rollercoaster ride, this movie goes through a lot of twists and turns and gives a lot of goosebumps now and then, which is really appreciable.
The acting might slack a little bit but the CGI and especially the major villain the Indo-Rex is pretty impressive.
Those dinosaur fights are good and the entrance of Rexy(T-Rex) from the paddock 9 was thrilling, impressive and iconic.
All in all, I will give it a 8.",Jurassic World
791,doctorcd2005,For Disneyworld goers only...,2,2 October 2015,"Judging from a lot of the reviews I have read here I think people expected a bit too much from a PG rated predictable dino Hollywood blockbuster. Object: maximize revenue. How: maximize target audience: kids, mums and dads and guardians will pay also to take them along. GI Joe meat lovers, teeny boppers, and movie watchers who like the thinking done for them, CGI and perhaps 3D appreciators.It is not a new idea to weaponise a new and useful technology, there was the essence of a good story that could had the potential to carry extreme suspense but was poorly executed despite setting itself up for a sequel. Instead of creating the drama and suspense it felt like the director created and emphasized an atmosphere of a day out in a Disney park. The character flaws have been dealt with in many other reviews and I can only add one piece of absurdity that I noticed, what was the point of the Indian CEO's bad helicopter flying ? His role adds nothing to the plot and his character set up as the buffoon to laugh at, and when his helicopter crashes in a ball of flames. Left me wondering just... what is the point ?I suggest Ridley Scott direct the next installment. And target an M or even R rated audience",Jurassic World
792,calliope25,"Sexist, offensive piece of trash",1,25 January 2016,"PLEASE NOTE: I don't consider any of these spoilers; what's below is the kind of thing you might see in a trailer. But if you want to be extra careful, I guess stop here.I almost never write movie reviews, but this film made me so angry that I have to say something. If all I do is prevent one person from wasting a penny on it, I will be happy. Why? Well, this may be one of the most misogynistic movies I have ever seen. It is so insulting to women that I am blown away it was made today and not 75 years ago. Yes, it's an adventure flick; I suppose we're just supposed to take it as it is – a silly blockbuster – and not read too much into anything. But it was so glaringly awful that I almost couldn't finish.Claire is the butt of almost every joke. She's portrayed as some kind of emotionless, control-freak ice queen and the movie is going to teach her a lesson aboutwhat? Being more nurturing and feminine I guess? Rather than going on and on, let me just give a few examples of what I mean.1. At the beginning of the movie, Claire's big boss and the owner of the park comes to visit so she's unable to spend the day with her nephews because, you know, she has to meet with her boss. One of her nephews looks like she just kicked a puppy, even though she promises to take the entire next day off and give them a backstage tour. Then her sister calls actually in tears because Claire is neglecting her nephews in what was supposed to be a family vacation. From work. She calls from work to chastise her sister for having to work, even though she and her husband didn't take time off to go with them on this so-called ""family"" vacation.2. When her nephews go missing, she turns to Big Tough-But-Sensitive Hero (BTBSH) for help. He asks how old they are, and she says one is in high school and the other is a few years younger. He's incredulous that she doesn't know her nephews' precise ages. There is a MAN-EATING MONSTER on the loose, this woman is terrified for her missing nephews, and he's criticizing her for, in a moment of panic, not knowing exactly old her nephews are?! I would think knowing one is in high school and the other is a few years younger is plenty enough information! But no. Because she is a horrible woman.3. Both BTBSH and Claire (but mostly BTBSH) save the kids on several occasions, and after one incident, they ask to stay with ""you."" Claire passionately promises she'll never leave them again, and they reply: ""No him. We want to stay with him."" Ha ha? I justI can't. I can't.I could come up with plenty more moments like this but I won't. And what makes this especially sad is that in the first Jurassic Park, way back in 1992, the main female character was this, great, strong, competent woman, who doesn't need saving any more than anyone else (unlike Claire). And the girl (there's a brother and sister in that one) is also smart and brave and even plays a major role in saving the day. This time, the only girl with a speaking role is the older boy's mooning, clingy girlfriend who begs him to send a selfie every day because she'll miss him so much. Whereupon he promptly goes off and eyes every girl he sees at the park. Boys will be boys? It makes me want to cry that there are people in this day and age who would write this kind of offensive sludge and think it's funny. I want that two hours of my life back.",Jurassic World
793,DEATHSukka4,Jurassic Park vs. Jurassic World & Why the Sequels Get It Wrong...,5,20 June 2015,"The 5th film in the franchise comes 12 years after JP3, and that's because its been in a sort of development hell. I've kept tabs on the production of this film since 2005. It was a breath of fresh air to say the least, when I first laid eyes on the official trailer 10 years after first hearing about its production purgatory.Both Lost World and JP3 happened on a different island, Isla Sorna, and revolve around different problems; While the original movie and Jurassic World take place on Isla Nublar. JW picks up the pieces left behind 22 years ago, making it a direct sequel to the original movie.The same CGI and animatronics are available today, the same budget, the same quality actors, the same writers (minus Crichton, who wrote the novels the Jurassic Park franchise is based on), and if anything Jurassic World has a 22 year leap in technology to take advantage of.So how does it stack up to the original movie? Here's the thing about Steven Spielberg, and this best explains the differences between these two films... he was experienced and established in Hollywood long before Jurassic Park.Spielberg directed Jaws at the age of 29. Since then he had blockbuster after blockbuster: E.T. the Extraterrestrial, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters, 1941, and Hook which were all massive multi-million dollar successes. Along his journey, he forged several important relationships with people that would influence his work; John Williams, Phil Tippett, Stan Winston, David Koepp, and George Lucas to name a few...In his 1980's run, he quickly became one of the most successful directors in Hollywood history... that's difficult to really appreciate, but know that if Amblin or Universal Studios has any sort of interest in a film, that project probably found itself in the hands of Spielberg at one point or another whether he's credited or not.So here you have a director that's experienced with animatronics, small scale and large scale models, practical effects, massive productions budgets, and who has a good, clear vision. Spielberg was the best director for Jurassic Park; almost as if he was conceived to direct it. Spielberg had a composer, he had a special effects guy, an animatronics guy, he had a CGI studio on tap... Jurassic Park's success was really a culmination of Spielberg's experience and relationships with the best names in the business all coming together under his direction. The timing could not have been better.Jurassic Park was a perfect blend of CGI, animatronics, and practical effects mastery. In the early 90's, animatronics were at the height of their relevancy; and since the death of Stan Winston, there really hasn't been anyone to fill his shoes. The industry has gone from clay models and stop motion animation, to animatronics, and now CGI completely dominates the industry. Obviously none of these technologies would out scale CGI. So in a way, animatronics and puppetry are kind of a lost art and irrelevant.As for CGI, I'm sure there's been many different techniques that were pioneered but ultimately the only difference between CGI today and 22 years ago is the time it takes to render a scene. Back in 1993, it would take hours just for one frame to be rendered, so Spielberg HAD to rely on practical effects, but considering his experience with them and the people he knew were masters of this craft, it was flawless executed either way.Finally, to top everything off on why Spielberg was essential for his role in Jurassic Park... he also knew how theme parks operated. He served as a creative adviser for Universal Studios Florida/Orlando and for Universal Studios Islands of Adventure. He's privy on what a theme park looks like. So in Jurassic Park, 1/3 of the film we're simply given a tour of the compound and we didn't see anything extravagant. Jurassic Park was really high-tech, but also very realistic which made it relatable to the audience. So again, Spielberg also knows the ins and outs of the theme park industry, making him valuable in the presentation of Jurassic Park - a movie about a theme park!Jurassic World comes to us from a completely different era in film which is at best trying to imitate the original but the director and the producers this time around fall short with their experience and ability. I'm sure Colin Trevorrow is a great director, but it just doesn't come across when he's plopped down in a director's chair that doesn't belong to him. He's barely qualified compared to the accolades Spielberg brought to the same director's chair for Jurassic Park.Its imitation, not real art. It's at this point a service, rather than an experience. There's no immersion, no creativity, there's no substance; JW looked uninspired.If you've seen Jurassic Park, the original movie, and Lost World, you've seen everything the franchise has to offer. Everything else is an imitation of these two movies - JP3 an imitation of LW, and Jurassic World an imitation of JP. Really, Universal Studios would be better off trying to relaunch the franchise rather than copy and paste CGI.",Jurassic World

The screenplay/writing is awful. Even for a Hollywood blockbuster it's uninspired and dull. There are also some very big logic holes. For example they use heat detection for the Indominus Rex even knowing he might be able to control his temperature. Also why should stealth be of any use for an IR ? Two kids repairing a 20 year old Jeep ... for real ? Also the music was very very bad. It was pushy and cheesy.I still give 3 stars because there were some funny moments the main characters were good and for the cgi ...,Jurassic World
795,robin-mckay80,A mixed bag,7,11 June 2015,"I was so excited for this film. I went with my dad.The film opens with two lads, prepping themselves to visit a theme park with dinosaurs. Amongst that, Owen is a worker at the park and is renowned for having a special relationship with the raptors. He also has a slightly frosty relationship with one of the women who has a role to play in the maintenance of the park.Soon, it is discovered that, to maintain people's enthusiasm for the park, that a totally new breed of dinosaur, indominus rex, has been created. Upon inspection of her paddock, it is assumed she has escaped. However, she has cleverly fooled the park personnel into believing this. In truth, she is still in her paddock and kills two of the observers and Owen narrowly escapes with his life, using his own brand of trickery to fool the indominus rex.As news of her escape spreads, It is discovered that the two boys have disappeared. They have foolishly gone off course in one of the park's mobility vehicles and been attacked by indominus. An act of bravery on their part, ensures they survive. Then, indominus' rampage gives way to other dinosaurs causing havoc and it is a race against time for the park personnel to stop indominus rex. The efforts include using trained velociraptors to attack indominus, with unexpected results and when it's realised the raptors are insufficient to stop the indominus, the tyrannosaurus is lured from its paddock, right into the midst of a duel that pairs velociraptor and t-rex against an unstoppable force. For all their efforts, the demise of the indominus comes from an unexpected source (a rather daft twist).I enjoyed the film for the most part and it is a typical summer blockbuster. Compared to the first trilogy, it isn't a patch really. The film gets to the action too quickly and moves at a pace that's uncomfortable. There isn't enough development. I didn't like the fact that Dr Wu was made out to be a villain, really, even if it was an intriguing direction for the character to go in. The other characters are mainly bland and don't have any real depth to them - the exception to this are Ty Simpkins and Chris Pratt. Some of the other portrayals were OK, if not overwhelming. The effects, though, are top drawer and I was kind of underwhelmed by the indominus, in truth. The masosaur was much more interesting, I believed. It's not given enough screen time, yet there is little it can do. The aviary sequence, I felt, was too similar to the third film and speaking of sequences, there isn't a set piece worthy of note, which was disappointing.Yet for all this, it isn't a bad film, just not the vehicle one may hope for. It's certainly an entertaining film, though,. You won't leave disappointed, in that respect, but you won't leave overwhelmed, either.",Jurassic World

That was so forced and obtuse, it warranted the whole movie having a late term abortion. The back alley kind with a rusty coat hanger.The obese security guard in the paddock deserved to die the second he started talking with food in his mouth and for assuming that was an acceptable thing to do. They got something right, but he still needed to die quicker.What's with this half reveal the antagonist deal? We've already bought the ticket or the movie, it's not like they're trying to trap us in for some Lost Season 1 smoke and mirrors shenanigans. Lens flair too.Where do they get the nerve? Show us the ******* thing already you JJ Abrams wannabe tool.I like Chris Pratt. He's kinda funny and a decent actor. That doesn't mean you get away with just casting him and not bothering with any other decent actors, a script, a director or anything else that makes a decent movie. But what's particularly crippling about Jurassic World is that Trevorrow and his three fellow co-writers populate the film with stock human characters who as much personality as the dump I took directly after watching the movie. Pratt demonstrated a winningly self-deprecating sense of humour in Her, The Lego Movie and on the TV series Parks And Recreation, and his ascension to movie star with Guardians Of The Galaxy was especially cheering, suggesting that he could become an A-lister without losing the modest humanity and sweet common touch that were his trademarks. Sadly, his Owen is a somewhat sensitive mush mouth who probably had to be held back several years and in real life would have tattoos on his neck and hands. He also seems to read of a q card: Whether he's establishing a personal connection with one of the dinosaurs or bickering with the walking nun's fanny, Claire, the character isn't much fun — nor is he compelling or swaggering enough to come across as a magnetic dramatic presence.

Going out of the movie I got what I was expecting: big dinosaurs chasing people while the fate of some island is at stake. The effects were pretty good and the chase scenes will keep you on your toes. Pretty much all the characters give decent performances for an action flick but almost all the characters have been taken from other films. The plot kind of resembles How To Train Your Dragon 2 near the end though I'm not complaining that much because it does add that ""animal food chain/social dominance"" theme created by the big dino asset.

If you want a formulaic movie that is fit for the 7-10 year old bracket this is probably the ticket. The characters couldn't be more stereotyped if they tried.I got the feeling that Mr Pratt twigged to the fact that this was based on a poor screenplay and therefore did an amazing job at underplaying his role (as much as the director did try and set him up with such clichéd scenes); my hat goes off to him (genuinely).

I am stunned that this even got close to passing concept discussions let alone released.That said, it was and I would have loved it if they included in the film the boardroom discussion that would have had to have taken place to allow this farcical park, with its farcical assets, to be funded. I think it would go something like this:""So we've brought back dinosaurs but boy have they gone stale quickly (really?).

This is one smart 'whateversaurus', impossibly smart. It also has its own instinctive language, which is even more absurd and I'm not going into. Aside from this, Chris Pratt is training the new stooges. For what? Well for the 3 Stooges reboot of course, either that or some new boy-band act. What the hell was the point of all that training? You also have Bryce Howard, who's character's only claim in this is the over publicised point that she spends the entire movie in high heels. That and the incredible chemistry her and Chris Pratt's characters share. Characterised in a nut shell by:""We use to date. Right?""""Yep.""""Cool.""Then you have my favourite character, 'The Preciousssss'. Who the hell is this guy and why is he even let past security? Or is he the guy that they spliced the 'whateversaurus' with? Every avenue of this preposterous character is so WTF, that he detracts massively from the very credibility of an already shocking film.Long story short the last 10 minutes is the funniest part of the film. Yep, I said funny. I couldn't hold it in any longer. It's so cheesy, so cheap, so Rockyesque and so far beyond the pale of huh?! that I wasn't a hundred percent sure that the T Rex wasn't going to master the power of speech and shout ""Yo Adrian, I did it"".Finally, at the very end of this 'talent aneurysm' the T Rex could have and should have adopted Sloth's voice, from the Goonies and shouted, ""HAY YOU GUYS"". It would have held the context to a far more apt degree than the roar. Can you believe these guys actually made fun of themselves in this film as if to say to the audience, ""Yeah we can do comedy"". No sh@@ Sherlock.Yep this film is bad. Bad, bad, bad. This is a pathetic premise, an abysmal storyline, a preposterous screenplay and script, followed, to a greater or lesser degree, by a poor casting of actors who I'm not sure are capable of playing anyone but themselves. Which makes me consider whether or not acting is done and that it's all in the casting, or miscasting as is possible in this case. It's hard to tell because there are no good points to give scale.Anyone, who isn't a stooge, who actually thinks this is even watchable is a symptom of the endemic cultural decay of this back-water planet. A decay which is far reaching and goes far beyond the tolerance of a crud film but the acceptance of the retardation of a planetary culture, giving way to stagnation, cattle-like mentality and eventual drone demise.",Jurassic World
800,jordanhjacobs,This... THIS could be epic!,9,24 June 2015,"I don't think they could have done much better on this effort here. The I- Rex is something we all wish could have been in the rest of the movies. It wouldn't be practical, there are too many other subplots to develop. But this dinosaur is just a hint and what could follow in the other sequels. We could see some Gorilla-Dinos soon, we might be feeding T-Rexes to the next hybrid. Also how the hell do they keep building these islands and not have proper protocol when stuff runs bad. Like their most powerful rifle couldn't take down a raptor. They should just all have RPGs at all times. One guy with a solid shot and that's the end of the movie. Also the redhead is a babe, and is more babe-a-riffic as the movie goes on...",Jurassic World
801,cadenrudolph,I love this movie! I have already seen it twice!,10,8 July 2015,I am a huge fan of this movie. I just love it I already went to go and see it on the big screen twice already it did not look fake the casting was incredible and also the way they set up Jurassic World looked so real I was just stunned and defiantly totally shocked. I loved Judy Greer as the mother of the two boys she was also in Two and A Half Men and The Big Bang Theory I loved seeing her In a bigger production or a movie I should say really! I loved How they casted Chris Pratt as Owen I loved him in The Lego Movie and Guardians of The Galaxy I also loved Aunt Clare's role I don't know the actresses name for her but she was great and both boys did an incredible just fantastic great job oh an Aunt Clare's Assistant whatever her name is did a great job acting as a girl who was hating her job just bored out of her mind.,Jurassic World
802,Cameron-Smith1996,"Predictable yes, but f****** awesome as well",8,25 August 2015,"I am a massive Jurassic park fan, the first movie is my second favourite film of all time, the second one I can enjoy and the third one...I can watch it and that's really it. Now since I am reviewing this over 2 months since I last saw it, I will be going into spoilers, so prepare. Now I want to start of with the bad so that I can totally go into a fan frenzy to finish off the review. First of I thought the characters could have been a tad bit better as could the writing, as whilst it wasn't abysmal and completely cheesy as say Pacific Rim it still could have been better. Though I will say I enjoyed the main group of Owen (Chris Pratt) Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who I was expecting to hate and actually liked so points for that. And the two kids Grey (Ty Simpkins) and Zack (Nick Robinson) who I did end up enjoying as well. Two of my biggest complaints character wise is one they try and force in the character development, like when Grey starts crying about the parents getting divorced which came out of no where, yes the film hinted and you could pretty much guess that was what was happening, but in terms of his character it felt random as he gave no indication before hand and afterwards he was all happy and smiley again. My other gripe is with 3 characters themselves which are the new park owner Simon Misrani (Afran Kahn) Chief geneticist Henry Wu (BD Wang) and head of security Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio). I felt Misrani was too cheesy and wasn't as lovable as the late Richard Attenbrough's John Hammond and turning Henry Wu into mad scientist felt strange. But my biggest complaint is Vincent D'Onofrio and his weird character portrayal of Hoskins, not to mention the stupid idea of using raptors (and other dinosaurs) as weapons. I honestly felt that either the writers, the actor of the character himself was on crack. The line delivery, the body language and just the dialogue felt awkward and weird, which is disappointing as D'Onofrio impressed me as Wilson Fisk in the Daredevil show on Netflix. And the weaponised dinosaurs subplot was stupid and I didn't like how they are setting up the sequel to feature more of that idea, it feels like a straight to DVD movie. There are other minor grips as well like starting up a 22 year old jeep and RUNNING IN HIGH HEEL, but let's get to what I loved about the movie. Now I love dinosaurs, always have since I was young (coincidently since I watched the first Jurassic Park) and I was so pleased to see them done in an awesome way again, and yes the lack of animatronics and the over use of cgi in some parts as well as the cgi not being 100% great was disappointing it was still a pleasure watching these dinosaurs on screen, like when Zack and Grey roll up to the dinosaurs in that open space, with the soundtrack that was playing, it was awesome. And the two things I was most concerned about, the trained raptors and the hybrid dinosaur, well they where easily some of the best parts about the movie, the raptors still felt cool and intimidating, I liked Owens relationship with them and enjoyed watching his interactions with them. And the indominus Rex was very cool, I liked the look, it was very subtle, there was nothing too obvious about its appearance that made you think it was a hybrid, in short it looked like something that could have existed. I like how they handled its abilities, it was intelligent without it feeling a bit too unbelievable, the scene where it came out camouflaging was awesome (and the film should have had more). And the scene where it makes the raptors turn on the humans and you cut to the control room and see the raptor cams, looking at them was pretty badass. Also the soundtrack I really liked especially when the kids where arriving to the island and the original theme started to play, well I had a massive smile on my face, speaking of which I now tell you to brace yourself for I am going to explode into a massive nerdgasm. When I was 8 years old, I watched Jurassic Park 3, and when the infamous fight between the T- Rex, my favourite dinosaur of all time, and the Spinosaurus was over, a cloud hung over my and my love of the T-Rex it felt as if my child hood was never going to be the same. Well that cloud was dispersed and that 8 year old boy had the biggest cheesiest smile on his face when the T-Rex (the original one from the first film which was even more awesome) smashed through the Spinosaurus skeleton and started to face off against the Indominos Rex. The whole thing from when Owen gets his raptors back and turn them on the indominous to the fight between the T-Rex and the I-Rex, to Blue coming along and inadvertently saving Rexie (yes I know the name of they-Rex and I am not even sorry) then Rexie and blue fighting the indominous together, which was all one shot starting from where blue jumped onto the indominous to the mosasaur jumping out and dragging the Indomious into its pool. All of that I found highly entertaining. And that sums up this movie, it's highly entertaining and really I wasn't expecting much else, all I wanted was a fun movie with some throw backs and feelings of nostalgia which I thought where done really well. It's not as magical as the original, but it was still a very good summer movie that I will happily own on blu-Ray along with the rest of my JP collection. Therefore I give Jurassic World a roaring 8/10",Jurassic World
803,Top_Cat84,"Good kids movie, not so good for adults",6,17 June 2015,"Firstly I will say that this is a good movie for kids. If you have a kid definitely let them see this movie as they will be completely enRAPTORed (sorry). I can definitely see that.As an adult you may have a different opinion. It starts like a TV movie with parents sending their kids off to the Jurrassic World errm park.One of the kids is inexplicably completely bored with the idea of seeing any dinosaurs...it's like wise up, they've only been extinct for millions of years.The CGI looks a lot better in the dark than in the light, but this is true for any current movie.The characters are all lacking the emotional depth and humour that made the first film so endearing. Chris Pratt is fine but basically just plays an obnoxious loudmouth with little likability. Bryce Dallas Howard's character is so under-developed - I swear her script probably ran for less than a page and all it said was 'Sigh' here and 'Gasp' there. The two boys are fine, if not a bit annoying.What, incredibly, is something that is completely lacking is that there are no moments of tension or anticipation AT ALL. If you think about the original when the ripples in the water gave the sense of foreboding doom and how much this added to the whole atmosphere of the film it's unbelievable there's absolutely nothing like this in this film.Some of the homages to the original are good but all in all I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be.",Jurassic World
804,Nitesh_Singh,As good as previous parts. Revisiting old memories and making new ones. A worthy addition to the series.,10,14 June 2015,"As in the movie, (spoilers) there is a scene where we are told that the audience of Jurassic World wanted bigger and more dangerous dinosaurs and in response, the owners made them without worrying about the consequences.Same is the case with people expecting so much in this movie that they don't like it. A movie cannot appease everyone. It cannot be so long to contain lengthy character development and other scripts. That way it will run 5 hours. I think with the bad reviews people are expecting stories where dinosaurs are roaming in the world and again reigning it, the same world where every species other than humans is endangered. Come on! What different story people want? They only know better.Yes it was predictable, as are disaster movies and movies made on real events, but people still like them. The movie made me revisit my childhood again. The close escapes are seat-grabbing ones. I don't remember the last time I had to grab seat for such scenes though I totally smirk and laugh at almost all horror movies. The movie takes you straight into action and character development is done during the action. I even felt for the dinosaurs, particularly the raptors. Humans exploit every being, even in the movie...haah! Everyone has acted good according to the role given to them.Overall if you watch a thrilling movie almost everyday then you can ponder upon whether to watch or not. Otherwise it is not a waste, it is a properly made and involving movie. They have even planned a sequel, so maybe the story people want is on it's way.",Jurassic World
805,dexmor18,stupid,1,31 January 2021,"Horrible piece of crap, why would dinosaurs become senseless creatures that attack humans like the plague? It makes no sense at all, Is the message of the movie: Humans Suck? if it is, I guess they nailed it. Terrible acting as well; other than maybe Jake and Chris.",Jurassic World
806,rikandum-205,"Much better than the average blockbuster, truly a masterpiece!",10,10 June 2015,"Before watching Jurassic World, I expected good things about it, but I didn't feel like it was going to be something close to the original. I kinda felt like the trailer showed a lot from the movie itself, mainly the big bad dino. Well, I was wrong. I don't like to judge a movie by the trailer, but when I watched the actual movie, I was clearly surprised.The movie starts off with very-well done character development, and you get to know what Jurassic World theme park is all about. The way it works, the main attractions, the overall park functionality are actually believable. The characters stand out for they personality and it's quite impressive the way they connect through-out the movie run- time.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is able to think like the dinos, and he raised 4 Velociraptors to obey his instructions. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is in charge of the park functionality. Zach and Gray are Claire's nephews. They get into serious trouble by running away from the park.And then, there's Indominus Rex, the genetically modified hybrid, that is able to think, hunt and make chaos like no other dinosaur. It's huge, and it's the most vicious creature ever seen in a Jurassic Park film yet. The Indominus like every other dino in the movie looks absolutely astonishing, it's wonderful to see how much the CGI advanced since the first movie.There's tons of detail in the dinos expressions and CG landscapes. But it's not all CG, like the original they also used special effects with real life props of dinos in some scenes.It's predictable in some parts, but I can assure you that it won't cease to amaze. A movie like this, is the perfect example of what a well-done sequel is, even though the movie ignores the existence of The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.This was, for me, the most anticipated movie this year, because I've been waiting for it for several years and it's finally here. I recommend to anyone who's a fan of Jurassic Park series.",Jurassic World
807,arvindsasikumar921,A gigantic letdown,6,11 June 2015,"So I went to watch Jurassic World today with my 10 year old little brother with really really high expectations. Being a huge fan of the original Jurassic Park directed by Steven Spielberg, I have since been rooting for every subsequent movie releases in the Jurassic series, but they had all turned out to be a big disappointment. When I heard that Jurassic World was gonna come out this June, I was really excited. With a good trailer and Chris Pratt as the leading actor in the movie, I was really hoping to see a spectacle. I don't know whether it was the high expectations I had for this film, but Jurassic World for sure let me down.The story is pretty straightforward. Several years after the first Jurassic Park, a new theme park with Dinosaurs have been established, called the Jurassic World. But unlike the original Jurassic Park, the Dinosaurs in Jurassic World are not born from real eggs, they are mankind's creation (from cloning, yada yada). The park has been successfully running for about 10 years, but public enthusiasm for the park has been steadily declining as Dinosaurs were no longer something you could only see in the movies - Dinosaurs were now a common place, even found in zoos around the globe. So to get back the public's enthusiasm (and thus to get more investors pouring in more money into the park), the scientists over at the Jurassic World create a hybrid Dinosaur, named Indominous Rex. As one can predict, this plan backfires, with the Dinosaur turning out to be an incredibly intelligent animal, with abilities like changing its color to camouflage with its surroundings, withholding its thermal radiation so as to not be detected by the military's thermal detectors, etc. This intelligent killing machine hunts down all other animals inside the park purely for sport, including the 20,000 plus humans trapped inside the island (the park is located on an island) with no means of quick escape. And amidst all this chaos, there are 2 kids running around, who have the same (if not more) screen time than Chris Pratt (I'm not going to get into the details of it so that I don't spoil the movie for you (though there isn't nothing much for me to reveal, the story of the movie is pretty straightforward)). And I think you all can guess what happens at the end (ya, the dinosaur dies and the park is destroyed, like always).This one is a pretty straight forward movie, with mediocre acting and mediocre visuals and mediocre sound effects. The whole movie was mediocre which is why I have given it 6/10. If I have to praise someone, I'd say Chris Pratt was good, the brothers were fine too. I didn't particularly like Bryce's acting. The script and the direction were really bad, they could have been so much better. Some visuals were good, but I expected a lot better from a Jurassic movie made in 2015 (hell, I liked the visuals in the 1993 film more). The 3D wasn't impressive either (except a couple of good moments). I don't understand why anyone has failed to make another good Jurassic Park movie? The series has lot of potential, infinite scope for innovative ideas and impressive visual effects. Instead, this series also ends up like Transformers, lots of potential, but a disastrous result.I would have given this movie a 5/10 even, but my little brother enjoyed it very much, which made me wonder if the target audience for this movie were kids. If so, then this isn't a bad movie to take a kid to. Otherwise, you may wanna skip this one.",Jurassic World
808,wjets9,No Rating is High Enough,10,13 June 2015,"This movie is absolutely amazing. I went into it with sky high expectations and walked out feeling completely satisfied.In this film, Jurassic World is a fully functioning theme park, bringing in 20,000 tourists daily. In an effort to spike attendance with a new attraction, Dr. Wu (BD Wong) creates a new kind of dinasaur, the Indominus Rex. This dinosaur is literally what nightmares are made of, a combination of intelligence and force makes it a truly terrifying thing. Needless to say, upon a safety inspection of the ""cage"" that it's held in, the creature escapes and brings havoc all over the island. I personally love the casting of this movie. Chris Pratt (for all those who still doubted his leading man capabilities) plays the trainer of the raptors, and he has clearly perfected this part. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the uptight, financially minded business woman and plays it to a tee. Vincent D'Onofrio plays Hoskins,the ""villian"", aside from the dinosaur of course. He plays this part so well that I was anticipating his death scene from the second I saw him, and when it happened I almost started cheering. The 2 kids, Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson)created child characters which I actually found to be very likable. Irrfan Khan plays Simon Masrani, John Hammond's successor and also a bit of a John Hammond-esque character. BD Wong plays Henry Wu, and I love the choice of bringing on and actor from the original. And to wrap it up, Jake Johnson, Omar Sy, Lauren Lapkus and Katie McGrath excel in their more minor roles.The visual effects in this movie are absolutely astonishing. The Indominus Rex is absolutely terrifying and the other dinos look incredible. Isla Nublar, as per the last movies, looks incredible.The violence and fighting blew my mind. The ""final battle"" had so many twists and turns with the Indominus, the raptors, T-Rex, and a short but oh so important appearance by the Mosasaur kept me on the edge of my seat because I never knew what was going to happen next.Overall I'd say that this movie gets a 15/10.",Jurassic World
809,ethanmidd,Great Example of a Popcorn Flick,6,25 June 2015,"It's obvious and safe to say that this movie is not as good as the Steven Spielberg film. Is it better than the second one? I'm going to have to say yes on that. What this movie is is a popcorn movie. You just have to go in and have a fun time and I did, I had a lot of fun with this movie.Yes it's more of a monster movie than an actual Jurassic Park movie, but that's all right. It did focus on the Jurassic theme overall. It was just that there was a dinosaur running around and a lot of people were running around.It may sound like the story isn't that interesting if you just read the last sentence. Overall it isn't a bad story. There was a subplot that involved the kids and it seemed pointless when the movie was trying to give us feelings for the kids but it didn't work. Other than that the story wasn't that bad. How was the acting? That's probably the weakest part of the movie.The only actor that really stood out was Chris Pratt. He's definitely got talent. He wasn't acting like Andy or Starlord in this movie. We got a new character who was serious most of the time, because of this, I'm okay with whatever Chris Pratt does in the future. Bryce Dallas Howard wasn't a bad actress in the movie, but her character wasn't that great. At first she was more of the exposition girl, telling all of the important things to the plot. Then she was just a girl who's uptight and really didn't add a whole lot to the movie. It's not her fault though, it's the writing. Jurassic World may be a ""monster movie"" but it still has elements of Jurassic Park, there are many times where it felt like a Jurassic Park movie. Especially the final act of the movie. Gosh that part of the movie was very fun, without spoiling anything.Jurassic World is a very fun movie that people will enjoy. Yes the subplot that involve the kids may not be the best part of the movie and the characters could have been better written except for Chris Pratt, but it's still better than the last two movies in my opinion. This movie has dinosaur action and well written comedic moments. I will probably go see this movie again in theater because I had so much fun with it.",Jurassic World
810,ayush0793,A complete letdown,3,17 June 2015,"Jurassic World was a complete show-off, making least sense. This movie is suitable for children of age 13 or below.The movie has a lot a genetically altered dinosaurs if that's what you wish for. But.. Seriously Disappointed. This is neither a sequel nor a sidetrack of Jurassic Park. The magic and thrill of JRs were missing. The story was simple-minded as well as the direction was sloppy. The cinematography was awful. Everything was wrong with the story. The world never learned from the past failures of Jurassic Parks, a state-of-the-art security system failed, a private contractor just happen o have an army waiting for his commands... The list is very long.Most of the characters were irritating (including Bryce's character) and were for the most part stupid. A 10-12 year kid was abnormally smart and knew almost everything when required to move the story along. In the chaos after the escape in the forest, they(the kids) just happen to find a well-conditioned storage/garage. The direction as well as the cinematography was awful. The story was very predictable and loose. Certain objects including cars and guns just appeared out for the hero. Chris Pratt. AAAh. Being the main lead, he was literally begging all the time to let him help people and held no authoritative power at all. His character was so humanitarian that all he could talk about was his pet dinosaurs -- mutual trust between him and dinosaurs. He was so successful in this task that the raptors( one of the fiercest dinosaurs), intentionally saved his characters life.Rest assured, if you are a JR fan you must watch this movie but don't get your hopes very high. Even with improved VFX you will not feel the chill.",Jurassic World

I just like it the way I did when I first saw the original Jurassic Park.Will definitely watch Jurassic World again.

First let's start with what I like: The acting is great. It's a high breath of life after the atrocities that were in Lost World and JPIII. Chris Pratt doesn't overact to anything like you'd might expect in a Jurassic Park sequel. Also, there is more of a story than its predecessors, and the effects actually look as if they put effort into it. However, there is one major problem I have with the movie: It tries way too hard to be a monster movie, and not a science fiction film. It's going the 1998 Godzilla route and just trying to make everything go with the 3D. So to sum up, it's not bad, but it doesn't measure up to 1993's Jurassic Park.",Jurassic World
813,randaashraf-70075,A typical Jurassic World Ride,9,4 July 2015,"Directed By: Colin TrevorrowWritten By: Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Derek Conolly, Colin TrevorrowUS Box Office: $500.4MJurassic World brought in $204 million in its opening weekend.After a decade of success Jurassic World has been declining because dinosaurs are no longer surprising or captivating the customers. So to bring in visitors the park's owner Masrani (Irrfan Khan) employs the best scientist he could find Henry Wu (B.D. Wong) to create a species like no other and that he does.His creation will defy all other dinosaurs and even technology. Genetic modification and playing God for greed is a true presentation of lust for power WU creates another selfish creature just like him but humanity cannot exist that way.Park manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) only sees margins but soon enough notices some subtle yet alarming behavior so she sees the raptor trainer Owen (Chris Pratt). Right away the sexual tension is clear which mirrors the old 'Jurassic Park' movies if not the 'Romancing the Stone' or 'Indian Jones' franchise.Then Claire's nephews (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) of course come because this movie must include a kid and a teenager if not siblings in general. The concept of the older brother letting go of any chance he gets with a girl at the park if his little brother needs him is so sweet. The nephews have their own VIP tickets thanks to their aunt so they run away from Claire's assistant who takes them on safe, boring places meant for way younger kids.Soon enough problems ensue and the games begin. It's the thrill of the chase and being where the action is what they wanted to witness but not be a part of. But the dinosaur killed for sport and had camouflage ability of lizards and disappearing ability of fish and the intelligence of God knows what else.Then there is a another selfish, greedy villain appears (Vincent Onforio) and he wants to showcase the dinosaurs to receive money and fake fame and recognition from television. This is one roller-coaster ride that is worth it despite the familiar plot line. There is comedy in there from Chris Pratt to Jake Johnson.The State of the art theme park and dinosaur design and special effects is spectacular. Definitely deserves a 9/10. This movie doesn't demonstrate much creativity so it does I truly want to see more of this franchise it is not tired it is timeless for me and hope it continues forever. However, at times is dull and repetitive with the cat and mouse passé plot.",Jurassic World
814,agsteribbe,"Mercedes World, no sorry Jurassic world",7,27 September 2015,"Mercedes World is a nice popcorn movie about an Island in the Central America region where you will find a lot of Mercedes cars running about a lush jungle. You get to see the Mercedes star up close in every 3rd scene and for the real spotters among us, there is quite some diversity in the movie.There is the G series, the 6 wheeled monster you probably have seen on top gear and of course quite a lot of Kastenwagen, or in English Vans. And the movie really opens with the new Bmw X6 coupe ripoff that Mercedes recently introduced.Plus there is a Cola sipping main character with a bike. O yes there is something going on with a few dinosaurs behind all the Mercedes action, it distracts a little from the cars.Seriously, this is a really dumb popcorn flick with dramatic music, fantastic quality CGI and AAFV or All American Family Values. So how to rate this movie ? If you look at how its made, and the creativity put into all the effects, its a 10/10. If you look at the story it's a 2 out of 10. So switch off your brain, pick up the popcorn and watch this Dinosaur Benz of a movie, just the once.",Jurassic World
815,sweper74,"Great special FX, Average movie",5,24 January 2016,"Seen the movie twice now, first time at the cinema in June, and the second time on DVD just a week ago. I wanted to wait before I reviewed this movie, to reflect about it a bit first.I had pretty high hopes for the movie to be a good one, since I liked the past episodes of JP a lot. But it really didn't get me. The positive side is the special FX, really good and well crafted cgi. My favorite scene is when the boys goes on the tour with the gyrosphere and go off-road, ending up right on the I-Rex, lurking on them. That scene is the movie highlight for me. The Mosasaur is a nice acquaintance too, though a very short one unfortunately. We didn't get to see that creature that much. A pity. The acting of Chris Pratt and the two boys are pretty good too. They do their job. The guy with the old JP t-shirt to. However Bryce Dallas Howards character (Claire) felt really unrealistic. Not meaning to criticise her as an actor, but the character she played (which is not her fault). The character was a Park operation manager that did not know a thing about dinosaurs and what was happening around her. She also seemed to feel no enthusiasm for working with the animals overall in the park. How she would ever get that job from the beginning is a total mystery for me, and makes a plot hole for the movie. Also the character Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) is a sort of a question mark for me. So eagerly convinced that the military would have a major use of raptors. To make them to some kind of superior co-soldier/weapon in future wars? Really dull if you ask me. Also in the movie the old park building from the first JP movie was left untouched..degraded... No one ever noticed it until the boys bump in to it. Wouldn't it have been made to a museum at least and not just left like that? Overall the movie was an average ride. I would have given it 4 of 10 stars first but ended up giving it 5 at least. For me the earlier Jurassic Park Movies were much greater, the first and the second movie especially. I also prefer the third one before this, though it's (for me) unfairly low reputation. That one had a lot humor in it and also a nice flow through the entire movie. A great adventure ride that JW misses to deliver, even if the CGI is top notch. But a movie cannot rely on only CGI.",Jurassic World
816,willgross,Nostalgic cash grab,5,4 July 2016,"""Jurassic World"" is the third sequel (or possibly second first sequel? I'll get to that later) to Jurassic Park, my favorite film from childhood. As a dinosaur obsessed six year old, I begged and begged my parents to take me to see that movie, until, despite media reports that the film was perhaps too frightening for its target audience (i.e., me) my parents relented and took me to see it shortly before it's VHS release.Oh what wonders! My parents fears turned out to be unfounded, because I had come as close as I ever would to seeing what my six year old self wanted to see: dinosaurs in the flesh. How could I be frightened when I was this close to seeing my hearts desire? Admittedly, it is not that difficult to impress a six year old boy.I probably watched Jurassic Park 300,000 times between the ages of six and thirteen. It was undoubtedly my favorite film from childhood. I absolutely loved that film.In 2011, many years after I had last seen Jurassic Park, a local theater had a ""classic movie night"". This is also several years before Jurassic Park was converted into 3D for an official rerelease. Rewatching it, I was shocked at how well it held up, particularly the visual effects. Although my dinosaur obsession died before I reached adulthood (you could say went extinct, har har) my love of movies carried on, and Jurassic Park is truly a great movie. It has astonishing visual effects, tense and terrifying action sequences, likable and interesting characters, great performances from the cast, a far fetched but imaginative and intriguing plot, and has (almost inarguably) not been matched in terms of quality by any ""summer blockbuster"" made by Steven Spielberg since then.But I'm supposed to be writing a review of Jurassic World, which has none of those things. A not-quite-remake, not-quite-sequel to Jurassic Park, Jurassic World (as of my writing this) quickly became the third highest grossing film of all time (and quickly dropped to fourth after the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Obviously, I wasn't the only person anticipating this one. Despite eye rolling trailers and a general sense of ""been there, ate that"", I was going to see this movie no matter what.I am going to keep this review spoiler free, although I must say that the movie's plot makes very little sense in the context of the first two sequels to Jurassic Park. Indeed, while the first movie is referenced frequently both directly and indirectly, the sequels are treated as if they never happened. Whether this means that this is a ""selective sequel"" (striking The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 from continuity), or simply that Jurassic World is lazy with its continuity, is almost besides the point. 2&3: hate em. Let's forget about them.I'd be more okay with this tact if what was made was better. Jurassic World seems to have two somewhat contradictory goals: remaking Jurassic Park, and making a sequel to it. And in the sequel department, the writers have come up with a plot that seems to throw sh!t at the wall and see what sticks.Problem is, a lot of it doesn't. The plot is loose and all over the place. The tone is wobbly. The characters wooden, the performances uneven, and the visual effects no more spectacular than anything else released in 2015. Action scenes tend to carry little emotional weight.Which isn't to say that the movie is terrible, or even outright bad. It's not. Individual scenes, moments, and plot threads work just fine. They just don't congeal into a satisfying whole.Unlike Jurassic Park, which I made the mistake of rewatching immediately after this movie, for the first time since 2011. I was amazed at how well it held up, and how much better it is than this film is. This is an unnecessary remake. It is an unnecessary sequel.But we all wanted to see it. Hence: 4th highest grossing film of all time.",Jurassic World

819,mubeen710,"T.Rex back in business, man it was an awesome ride along ‪JurassicWorld",7,12 August 2015,"Hitting the screens exactly 22 years after the original, Jurassic Park a movie still regarded as one of the most artistically inventive concepts that mankind has ever touched upon in the field of entertainment. It is so amusing to see one of the most cherished movie franchises being revoked. The visual splendor of Jurassic World presents all the whiz-bang biological appeal of dinosaurs. It highlights creative set pieces that champion the excitement of a dinosaur disaster story. Jurassic World is by far the best entry since the first. Unlike the previous installments we are finally presented a fully functional dinosaur theme park for the general public to enjoy, but how a fun trip turns into a misery because of an over-smart dinosaur makes the audience engage them right from the beginning. Leaving out the popular trio - Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, the leads from the original film & bringing in Chris Pratt as a Velociraptor expert and trainer has not failed the director's plan in any manner. Despite his top pay, he doesn't appear until 20 minutes in & only on screen for a short period until the second hour. However soon after Pratt's stable role during the second half, he does captivate our attention and exudes the charm of a movie star. On the whole Jurassic World is the promising & deserving sequel that the loyal fans had been waiting for the past 22 years.",Jurassic World
820,sampersonthing,A lot of fun,9,11 June 2015,"This film was a lot of fun and easily the best sequel to the original film.First, I'll get the bad points out of the way. There was way too much CGI, they really missed some opportunities to use animatronics in places. Some of the CGI did look a bit off, especially with the raptors. There were some comedy moments that really didn't fit, and threw off the pace of the film.Bad points aside, Jurassic World is an incredible joy to watch, bringing out the inner 10-year-old in me, which is exactly what Colin Trevorrow set out to do. The film starts out slow, but soon builds up to some really thrilling and exciting moments that'll make any fan of the series squeal with delight. The film is very much a love letter to the original film, with a load of throwbacks to it. The icing on the cake is the score, which faithfully captures the feel of the original.Overall, Jurassic World does what it set out to do in spectacular style. It's not without its flaws, but it does a fantastic job at capturing some of the magic the original film had.",Jurassic World
821,raz-boy,Awesome!,8,11 June 2015,"I loved watching this movie! ""Jurassic World"" is a constant roller coaster of action. There are several that I particularly enjoyed about this film. First of all, the world itself! What I really liked about this movie is that it actually shows you the whole amazing Jurassic World. It shows you all of the major attractions of this incredible looking park along with even more incredible various creatures inhabiting it. The dinosaurs look insane! I don't think they could get any more realistic and terrifying. Secondly, the cinematography. The film is beautifully shot; each scene is like a vibrant, dynamic and a lot of times terrifying painting. I certainly did not except this movie to be so brutal and sometimes legitimately scary, but I loved that about it. The way the shot is used to build up the suspense is very well done. Acting is fine, nothing too special. Chris Pratt is cool, but he is basically playing Star Lord from ""GOG"". Humor in the film was pretty good, sometimes a little silly, but still funny. The parts with Jake Johnson (Nick from ""New Girl"") were really funny. Overall very very fun film, definitely not for little kids!",Jurassic World
822,billylarrick,"The good, the bad, the ugly",6,15 September 2015,"Directing: Who the heck is Colin Trevorrow and how did he get this job? The most glaring flaws in this movie could have been prevented had someone with more experience directing than a few shorts and one independent film been at the helm. From the incredibly painful to watch and headache inducing close-ups to the very rushed pacing of this film (especially in the first ten minutes) Trevorrow's inexperience as a director was glaringly evident. Without holding Trevorrow to the impossible standard of Steven Spielberg who has proved himself to be one of the greatest directors of all time, there was several areas where this movie proved too momentous a task for him. No failure was greater than the overabundance of close-ups which I can only assume were an attempt at creating intimacy between the audience and the characters/dinosaurs, but instead left an audience reaching for an aspirin. Worse than the headaches, however, was the effect they had on the visual presentation of the movie, especially the dinosaurs. Part of what made the first movie great was the suspense that was built by NOT SEEING THE DINOSAURS. Most who have seen Jurassic Park probably don't realize that the actual screen time of the dinosaurs is limited to only 15 minutes. What Spielberg realized with the first film is that the moments of anticipation (the puddle of water rippling, the snapping of the wired fence, the turning of the door handle from the raptor's claw) are just as exciting as actually seeing the dinosaurs. While we saw some of the this in the new movie, such as the claw marks on the wall and the realization that the Indominus Rex was still in its cage, for the most part Jurassic World relied on close-ups visuals of dinosaurs and action scenes to entertain its audience, rather than suspense. Because the audience's attention was forcibly zoomed in on so many shots, it also meant that there was a lack of grandeur that only panoramic shots such as the first introduction of the Brachiosaurus in the first film can provide. Yes people want to see dinosaurs but part of the what makes the dinosaurs appealing isn't just their destructive capabilities but also the wonder that seeing such magnificent creatures creates. I would argue the first Brachiosaurus scene in the first film is every bit as powerful as the famed scene where the T-Rex attacks the Jeeps.While a movie is the product of a team of people, it is the director who is ultimately responsible for the feel of the film and the techniques that are used to facilitate that director's style. This director seemed like he couldn't decided between whether he was making a suspense/action/thriller or a superhero movie.Special Effects: Too many close-ups meant we got to see every minute detail of CGI created dinosaurs, meaning that unlike the first film where the raptors were hidden in the shadows or used very sparingly to hide the fact that they look fake. In Jurassic World we see just how artificial looking they are as we are constantly bombarded by green-screen animation that at times looks more like a video game than real life. I could go on about this forever, but for the most part I was begrudgingly content with how much CGI was used when I consider how this movie COULD have been (ex: Episodes 1-3 of Star Wars)Story:New dinosaur is created, it escapes and wreaks havoc, ultimately it is killed. Very predictable but still enjoyable plot. I recognize that these movies aren't meant to be riddled with plot twists and for the most part the audience should know how the movie will end before it begins. Scene where they reintroduce the old park's main room: By far my favorite scene in the movie. The old banner, staircase, test tubes, jeeps, painting on the wall of the raptor, goggles, all gave me goosebumps and reminded me of how much I love the original movie. I really appreciated this scene and thought it was a great move for the makers of Jurassic World to pay tribute to the reason we are all in the audience. They tied these elements in and incorporated them into the plot seamlessly. Gyroball tour: Also a cool part of the movie and as a sucker for the herbivore scenes I thought this was an inventive and creative twist on the jeeps from the original movie. Jimmy Fallon's cameo was also entertaining and this scene was a good way to introduce the Indominous once it had escaped its paddock. Well done. Scene of Owen and Claire kissing: NO. No. NO!! When will Hollywood ever learn that NOT EVERY MOVIE NEEDS A LOVE STORY!!! I couldn't help but think of how disgusted I would be had the first film sank to the level of having Dr. Grant and Ellie kiss. To do it here was every bit as cheesy and corny as it would have been then. It also reduced Claire's role to the helpless female which is tiresome and annoying. Please, Hollywood, spare us next time.While I did my best not to judge the film with the expectation of it being like the first movie, respect and consideration for the first film is hard to separate and somewhat owed in evaluating any sequel. I thought it met my expectations and was somewhat disappointed it could not exceed them. Too much CGI, poor and inexperienced directing, and a weak secondary cast kept this movie from being great, but ultimately it was still very entertaining just being a Jurassic Park movie and I was pleasantly surprised by the main characters and some elements of the story.Check out my full review at http://windreelandprintmoviereviews.blogspot.com/Or just search Wind Reel And Print Movie Reviews",Jurassic World
823,topeth,"Simply popcorn entertainment, not what I quite expected",5,12 August 2015,"So I get it every now and then some directors pop up and remake/ruin a movie series. I wouldn't say Jurassic World is a complete ruin but it's not up to the mark. Let's see how: Acting: Average from almost every actor/actresses. None of the characters had/showed that much of potential to focus on them. Two of them supporting actresses are the worst.Story: Since it's a Jurassic Park continuation, I'd give it 0 out of 100.CG: Good, sometimes great. It's basically the only thing that might keep viewers going to see till the end.That movie lacks editing skills and full of make up loop holes. How come after all the chase with bullets and rocket launcher shoots the female (heroin) is on the make up? She spend almost all the movie wearing high heals and running around jungles. Is it really even close to possible? Except for the dinosaurs I can't give much credit to anything else.Even when the raptor found their new alpha, they still have soft corners to the old alpha? Really?? Just because you have to give it a closure, you gotta play something like that? WOW! I'd honestly request everyone not to watch it in theaters. You'd waste your valuable time and money. Rather wait for some Bluray DVD to come up. I for one, am disappointed. My rating: 5/10",Jurassic World
824,freewebstennis,Don't miss it. Highly recommended!,10,12 June 2015,"Well some critics over here are really harsh on the film. It seems like being harsh is so cool for them. But I don't like them. Seriously, this movie is awesome. They say the dinosaurs don't have such connections with humans and so on....as if they were in Jurassic period. The truth is why can't?! also the movie is based on dinosaurs created by small changes in original DNA gaps filled with present day animals. So they could exhibit such connection with human being. Anyways some people are always dumb and you can never make them understand. So overall I say don't believe in those negative reports. Also the movie was wonderful with cool scenes. Its not like Godzilla where I had to see the monsters for just 20min in whole movie. The Jurassic World gave me more satisfaction. I never got too tired to wait for the monster to appear unlike the Godzilla where I saw it clearly at the end LOL! I don't like to compare but if people think Godzilla was good then this movie far better than it! Climax is super awesome!",Jurassic World
825,Kabor120,I was with the Navy. Not the Navajo.,10,10 March 2016,"As an Avid Jurassic Park fan except for JP3. This film hit me a well thought after movie. There were some draw backs that you read in the comments pages like how could Claire out run a T-Rex in hill and another which i do agree with is that the kids should have been eaten because they were to whiny. It hard to replace performances from the original cast who played lex and tim. As for the CG and Graphics I'm always blown away on how it keeps changing and the dinosaurs always look better. as well as adding a hybrid well, let me tell great choice of adding a raptor rex mix. As the film progressed I was hoping for more dinos in the scene such a the mosasaurus. Other than that I give this film a big thumbs up.",Jurassic World

827,arogalsky79,Jurassic World doesn't disappoint,10,5 October 2016,"For those that complain 'Jurassic World' is just another dinosaur-eating-people movie, then they should have gone to see another movie. If you go to a Jurassic movie, expect dinosaurs, people, and dinosaurs eating people. For those expecting something different should have gone to see something different then. Now that my rant is over, I can go on to rave about how good this movie is. Jurassic World takes places approximately 22 years after the events of the first Jurassic Park movie. The park, a fully functioning amusement park and resort, is everything that was envisioned in the glory days. Trying to keep the interests of the audience, the lab scientists create a hybrid dinosaur called the indominus rex, which of course wreaks havoc on the park as the creators and employees of the park try to prevent it from eating (too many) people. Chris Pratt delivers a believable and exciting performance as a Navy soldier who was hired on to help train the velociraptors. He brings humor without forcing it, but also can bring the seriousness to it at the same time, which is what makes it believable. Opposite him stars Bryce Dallas Howard, a no-nonsense career woman trying to keep the park from falling apart and also find her nephews, who came to visit and spend time and of course, get caught up in the whole dinosaur-on-the-loose shenanigan. I give this movie this rating because I got exactly what I was looking for- a dinosaur movie that is entertaining, keeps me on the edge of my seat, and not distracted with poor acting or graphics. Again, if you're expecting to go see this movie and see something different then Jurassic events, then go spend your money on something else. Jurassic World gives you exactly what's in the title, so there should not be any surprises for a dinosaur to run loose and eat people.",Jurassic World

It is definitely a kids movie so you might hear rave reviews from them.
Ms. Howard was new to me ( again, I am not an avid movie-goer) and she did well enough in a big production like this.
I wouldn't spend the time to watch again - missing the draw / signs of a superb or timeless movie.But, very watchable, high paced throughout. I am sure the effect of seeing on the big screen with huge dinosaur heads breathing at you would have its great effect.",Jurassic World

Because of that, we can't feel the tension from this movie like Jurassic Park because we know where this movie going to.the animation must be using much good and expensive utilities. Still, the plot doesn't help much to make an excellent movie. This movie take a quite long time, you'd better watch it with friends because when you get bored in this 'up and down plot' ( i mean sometimes it's scary and good but sometimes it's boring) you got a friend to look at :)For me, this is still a slightly excellent movie.

The effects were average from what I can remember, and many of the action sequences had the same damn formula as what we have seen already THREE DAMN TIMES: raptors tackle the unlucky workers and slaughter them while the bigger theropods just gobble them up. That said, I really enjoyed the dino-on-dino scenes, especially the final confrontation between the tyrannosaurus and I-rex. Oh, and the death of the I-rex with the mosasaur dragging it under water was pretty damn awesome as well!The story was basic, and the characters were nothing special either save for Chris Pratt's character who was a total badass, not to mention that one scene where Claire started undressing on the waterfall, which in-short got pretty much every guy in the theater going (yep... That includes me!). The suspense, however, was pretty well-done, especially during the scenes lacking non-human creatures altogether.One last thing that I would like to say is that the humor in this was actually pretty damn funny. It didn't seem forced as in the MCU movies, and felt very naturally-occurring. In particular, there was the one scene involving the boys' British babysitter getting taken by the pterosaurs that could not get me to stop laughing! And of course there was the moment where that guy got friendzoned BAD.Overall, somewhere between 7-8.5/10. Decent movie, but not terrific.

832,rs9017720,A worthy but not perfect successor.,7,2 September 2015,"By now just about everyone who wanted to see Jurassic World, the fourth installment in the inconsistent Jurassic Park saga has seen it. It's a huge success financially, but was it a success in my eyes? For the most part, yes! This is an action-horror movie at it's roots, much like the original, and has some new additions to the lore of Jurassic Park. While the previous two sequels felt like retreads, for the most part Jurassic World is a step in the right direction and feels fresh. The leads do a fairly good job, (even if sometimes the writing isn't great) and the effects are solid. I was extremely excited to return to Isla Nublar once more to see a fully functioning dinosaur theme park. However, as stated previously, there are some corny lines and the characters feel underdeveloped for the most part, but the spectacle of the park and feeling of adventure and tension overcome these flaws. There is also at least one touching scene featuring an animatronic similar to those made by the late Stan Winston that is very effective. The finale is a love letter to fans of the series, and I could not contain my excitement during the film's final act. In the end Jurassic World is not a perfect follow up to one of my personal favorite movies of all time, but I never expected it to be as good as the original, so I was fully satisfied. 7.5/10",Jurassic World

Christ Pratt is awesome of course, and fits into his role very well. He has a lot of funny moments with Bryce Dallas Howard, which are pretty fun to see. The plot however, is one that is flawed. Other than the dinosaurs and Christ Pratt, this movie is just another Hollywood popcorn money movie.

I went to see this in theaters with my friend and we both agreed it was fun to watch but wasn't anything spectacular like it could've been. Once again though, this isn't a bad film.It is about these kids who go and visit their aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is the director of the park which is now open and functioning. She decides that the park is losing money because dinosaurs no longer mean anything, so they make a new hybrid dinosaur. Now of course there is a problem and it turns into an action adventure.The acting is actually surprisingly good from most of the actors and they do a pretty well job of reacting correctly in the scenarios they are thrown into. However, unlike the first one, I feel like there isn't as much wonder in this one. That may however be though to reinforce the idea that dinosaurs are now just a regular thing.The CGI is very detailed and intricate with the dinosaurs but honestly looks very fake and easy to tell that they aren't really there.

Chris Pratt's ""hero"" when faced with a new hybrid that he has never seen before, goes rushing into the dinosaur's enclosure (taking some other workers with him) and leaves the door open. He chooses not to wait for the info from the implant that would soon tell him exactly where the new beast is. . . when carnage ensues he then spends the rest of the movie blaming everyone else for the many deaths, etc that occur. This reminded me of Prometheus when the scientists almost immediately take off their helmets upon landing on the new planet, and then two of them stalk off and get LOST when Ridley has spent time and special effect $ on showing us the flying red balls that are mapping everything. Dumb actions from major characters = writers not working hard enough or not having enough time to iron these bugs out. Jurassic World could have been an absolute classic.

Bad acting also plays an important part in sinking this movie to mediocrity. Most characters are one-sided and behave either totally predictable or unbearable. Summary: good CGI; lots of dinosaurs; stupid plot; bad acting --> 6/10. Don't try to relate it to the original Steven Spielberg's movies, you'll be disappointed. Just enjoy it as a flashy monster fighting move which happen to feature dinosaurs.",Jurassic World
845,tone_lord,By-the-numbers blockbuster which delivers exactly as expected,7,19 June 2015,"Well, essentially my review is the title of my review, but to be a bit more verbose: The movie delivers absolutely everything you expect it to and not one iota more. It successfully evokes a hint of the wonder we felt back in the day when ""real"" dinosaurs on screen were a decided novelty. Who can forget the first appearance of the T Rex in Jurassic Park? Spine tingling, awesome, and terrifying all at once. This is a more jaded age, and we have seen dinosaurs in many guises since then, so it's not easy to WOW us in that way. Yet, in spite of that, Jurassic World does create some awe, tension, and excitement. As with Jurassic Park, the dinosaurs are the best part--the people not so much. But, at least there is no character in this film quite as annoying as Dr. Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park, and some of the characters are actually quite likable. It's worth seeing, but not more than once.",Jurassic World
846,magic_eight_ball737,Jurassic Money-Grab,7,14 June 2015,"I'll keep this review short and sweet.Jurassic World differs from its respective classic in that it aims to offer the audience some (albeit relatively uninspired) visual spectacles whilst delivering a plot that is somewhat reminiscent of the original Jurassic Park film. However, it fails to execute quite a few favourable ideas that, were they tackled by a filmmaker dazzled not by visual effects or money but by story and character, may have proved Oscar-worthy. Should you see this film? I'll list some pros and cons to help further your decision:Pros: Thrills and excitement typical of the average Hollywood blockbuster. Nostalgia that most Jurassic Park fans might embrace. Satisfactory storyline with satisfactory characters to fulfill it. Visually stunning locations that introduce a sense of wonderCons: Repetitive. Recycled characters who experience recycled story lines. Laughable and/or questionable dialogue that might raise some eyebrows. Intellectual threshold exceeds the film's grasp. Some neglect of Chekhov's gun, in which the film introduces many promising variables that in the end prove to have no meaning.In the end, any film is just a product that some consumers like and some consumers hate. Likewise, the only fair way to critique a film is to see it for yourself.",Jurassic World
847,midnighttheater,Decent but more a pale imitation of Jurassic Park and The Lost World than anything original or fresh.,5,18 August 2015,"Semi decent sequel picks up the story back at the original island 22 years later with a fully functional "" Jurassic Park"" that needs a new attraction to bring in new crowds of customers. Unfortunately, the newly created dinosaur has an agenda of it's own and breaks out of captivity in order to prove once again that man should not mess with nature. The movie is OK, with some decent jump moments and great set pieces, unfortunately we have seen all of this before with the first two films of the series (The first Jurassic Park and The Lost World) and those  were done much better and much scarier as well.  Not to mention the fact that the characters of those films were much more compelling and more fleshed out and had better original stories to work with. Chris Pratt tries his best with a flat headed character and brings some gravitas to the movie but he's lacks a compelling cast of characters to work with and the script is riddled with one cliché after another.   Bruce Dallas Howard is stuck with a cliché of a women's role and agree with the opinion that it's sexist and very badly written. The rest of the cast of characters are really not worth mentioning because they really did not add much to the film at all other than canon fodder for the rampaging dinosaurs at the park. The movie is a good afternoon movie to sit through and thank heavens better than the weak and disposable Jurassic Park 3 but it pales considerably against the first two Steven Spielberg directed films, The Original Jurassic Park and Spielberg's own sequel The Lost World. If there shall be another film, let's hope it at least finds some Interesting characters and a better premise that at least tries to be original and not a pale remake of what came before.",Jurassic World

Brother's affection is beautifully depicted in this movie. Visual effects are nor overdosed, it certainly adds lot of flavor to this 2hr movie. Excepting for the first 10 minutes, there is never a lag in this movie. Director Collin Treverrow has done an exceptional work.. Each and everyone in the star complement themselves well. Hero ""Chris Patt"" aka Owen does well in this movie, he certainly resembles Brendon Mccullum. Music is good, although some portion do has shades of BGM used in ""Lincoln the Vampire Hunter"".

Nothing like the T-Rex escape or memorable kills.The characters are so generic and cliché, there are so many one-line jokes, so many advertisement, so many running to nowhere that make me puke. The whole movie is so bright and colorful, there is no drama or excitement. No death scenes just blood on the wall, Asylum studio ultramonster kills just because it can, and friendly raptors and T-Rex fight among humans what just make me mad! I don't care about the kids' parents marriage or the non-existing relationship between the main characters.There's no logic in it, there's no goal, no good or bad outcomes.

There were at least for or five moments during the movie when I wanted to get up and leave this atrocious show. I just can't decide which aspect of the movie was worse than the other, the plot, the dinosaur design, the cast, the acting. The first Jurassic park story way back in 1993. was light years better in every aspect. It's really a terrible shame this one was such a disappointment. The only positive side of this movie was provided by damn good and realistic animal animation. To me any future Jurassic park movie sequel is a big ""No, No, No""!!!",Jurassic World
851,dashoost,5 Reasons to Avoid Jurassic World...A Massive Fail,1,14 June 2015,"Here are 5 of the main reasons why this movie was a massive fail...there are others of course, but I won't bother getting into those. 1. The red head chick (the ambiguously homosexual aunt) - Her stupid reactions caused the death of many people, but we are supposed to still be rooting on her side. The scene when she rolls up her sleeves to look all cute for Chris Pratt is the exact moment the filmmakers and scriptwriters literally gave up on this garbage sequel. 2. The two teenage brothers (Teen Beat magazines next up and comers) They are presented as a couple of soft, Jonas brother types from the moment their mommy has to ship them off, un-chaperoned, to her lesbian sister. The cringe worthy scene takes place when they jump off the edge of a waterfall into the abyss, escaping the evil dino, and they reach the shore and have a weird bromance moment instead of being in complete shock at what sheer terror they have just seemingly escaped. 3. The new ""Bad Guy"" (AKA Vince D'Onofrio) This guy wants to weaponize velociraptors for the military! He comes up with the idea that the raptors will hunt and kill a giant dinosaur for us humans, yet no one calls him out on his obvious addiction to crack cocaine. Nice job Vince! the beautiful way you mailed this one in, i'm sure the USPS has a spot for you when you decide to give up your acting career. Hopefully immediately, if not sooner. 4. The new ""Dr. Hammond"" (AKA Irfan Khan) This eccentric billionaire is so jaded he decides he needs to go on a heroic mission and jumps behind the controls of a helicopter, even though he is the least qualified person to pilot it, and eventually kills himself and a several other idiots that went along for the ride. 5. The T-REX (or lack thereof) Yes folks, if you saw the movie, you probably asked yourself WHY? Why is it that if anyone there knew they still had a T-Rex in captivity on the island, why didn't anyone think of freeing the original villain from Jurassic park in order to battle the new I-REX villain until the very last 10 minutes of the movie. Sacrificing countless lives and millions of dollars in damage along the way. -Finally, to anyone who stood up and cheered when the movie ended, you are all sheep. Its time to wake up folks. -Bottom line: THIS MOVIE WAS A MASSIVE FAIL!",Jurassic World
852,mr_mega_drive,One of the worst films ever made!,1,15 June 2015,"I'm really starting to despair for the human race, the fact millions of people around the world can go to see this film and walk away thinking that its in any way good is beyond me.This is the WORST Jurassic Park film by a long long way.Firstly there is zero character development and I mean zero. For all you morons out there who don't know what that is, it's understanding the characters back ground, beliefs and motivation. This helps you empathize with the characters and care about them making what happens to them effect you emotionally. You care about none of the characters in this film even Chris Pratt is wooden, its truly one of the most lazy pieces of writing I've ever come across.The plot is laughable there are more plot holes than nearly any film I've ever seen. Characters who do things no sentient being would ever consider let alone put into action. I wont list them as I'd be here till the insects take over.AND THE ENDING!!!! MY GOD!!! I got up and walked out the cinema shouting CR*P!!!! I honestly thought the T-REX and the Raptor where going to get it on. Then the Raptor walks away like Clint Eastwood!!!! please!!!! Seriously people please for the love of god ask yourself is this the best they could of come up with? I was eight when JP came out and knew even at that age it was a landmark film, the CGI in JP still beats this rubbish and you even care about the characters. Even Lost World and JP3 and vaguely believable story lines. This one is taking the p***!!!! Honestly if you think this film is good I feel sorry for you as I do the millions of kids who are going to see this thinking its good.It just makes me appreciate the first film so much more and realize how lucky I was to have seen such a wonderful film at that age.",Jurassic World
853,mlgayler69,So bad we were shouting at the screen,1,17 February 2018,"Where to start?
 Nobody, just nobody, could actually be as bad as these characters are at their jobs and actually keep them, no matter how useless some people actually are. So any believability has gone by five minutes in.
 Cardboard characterisation and a dreadful script - seriously, the 'We've got to keep the park open no matter how many people get eaten' and 'We can't kill the expensive dinosaur that is eating everyone' lines are not only infuriatingly fatuous but out of date since Jaws. The main female character is patronising, stupid, screechy, argumentative, arrogant and incompetent, but I have a horrible feeling we are supposed to admire her. Most of the male leads are either brash idiots or speak in cliches. The only likeable one gets killed in a helicopter crash. The children contribute nothing to the film and the parent divorce theme is clearly there to try and make us care about them, which it doesn't. 
It tries to make up for this by shoving dinosaur attacks in every few minutes - but they're all the same so after a while we were just laughing. It was soooo predictable. My son started keeping a body count.
Apparently raptors are now trainable. When the plot requires it, of course, they're not. But then they are again. Just like that. So there goes that bit of tension from the first film.
The end fight has no suspense but by then we didn't care - making dinosaurs bigger does not make them more interesting. 
'Well, where do we go now?' says the female lead at the end, whose deliberate and wilful stupidity as the person in charge of the park led to 37 people being eaten, hundreds injured, and millions of pounds of damage. You long to hear the male lead tell her 'Well, prosecution and a long jail sentence for you,' but he doesn't. They walk off into the light.
It was embarrassing to see what the fantastic vision of the first film has been reduced to. This one gives the impression of being made by numbers and from a cynical concern for focus groups rather than any desire to tell a story.",Jurassic World
854,KunalDevmane,The Amusement Mastermind,8,29 June 2015,"Took some time before writing this review because I heard lot of mixed reactions about the movie and most were neutral. But, we were extremely enthusiastic to watch Jurassic World, as we had admired the Theatrical Trailer released on YouTube, a year ago.Being a huge fan of Dinosaurs / Pterosaurs / Plesiosaurs and Steven Spielberg's concepts, this movie was an antibiotic for a long time sick person like me. I am absolutely sure that team at Amblin Entertainment have researched well on the future of Amusement Parks and the entertainment that it may provide to masses. This movie takes us to a new World ruled by creatures which were never a part of this planet as the base of the movie is fiction. But who cares about the facts, we come to theatres to get entertained and that's what the movie did.The story is awesomely sequenced. The casts are perfectly selected. Hats off! Animation and Graphic team. And i think this is, by far, the biggest assignment for Colin Trevorrow. Under his direction we have the biggest Dinosaur movie of all time and it is garnished with excellent amusement adventure of two kids (one teenager).Surprisingly, the Oscar man of India, Irrfan Khan had a long camera time, but it was actually worth it. I think that Colin purposely killed him, in the movie, as he was performing lead throughout.For overall satisfying our expectation, I will give it 8/10 at IMDb. I have not given the rest two marks as we believe the movie could have been lengthier.Thanking entire crew for an excellent adventure. Looking forward for more doses like this in near future.",Jurassic World
855,rmsccbm,Predictable but entertaining enough,6,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World is a visual spectacle that offers tasteless and non charismatic characters that are barely held together by some fantastic CGI. The characters were slightly bleak and boring like Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard who have the responsibility of holding the movie when the Dino action isn't in play. Speaking of which, the dinosaurs themselves are among the most fantastic characters in the film, as they provide a lot of emotion despite being make believe. The first 30 or so minutes were nostalgic heart tugging establishing shots of the new park which in itself is a debatable topic. Who goes back to a park that saw people get killed? The movie never really explains why and it was a bothering moment I was constantly waiting to be resolved. The final act of this movie were like classic Jurassic park, with great monster action and some great acting too, however the dependence on the Raptors to provide getaways and scares became all to irritating. In conclusion, this film was predictable and at times ridiculously loaded with cheese. But it's still an enjoyable experience that will entertain like it is supposed to. ----- C+",Jurassic World

There are two people who get together in the end, there are the kids who get lost in the park, and then there's a bad guy. When the kids are in the bubble, it's the same situation and the same shot as when the kids are in the car with the dinosaur in the first movie. Not to mention how cheesy the ending was. They were all safe and Dallas Bryce Howard and Chris Pratt literally walked off into a light. It was the perfect Hollywood ending. It's a modernized version of the first three. The improved dinosaurs are the only reason to watch this movie. Also, the 3D was pretty scary in some scenes.",Jurassic World
858,DoctorJackal,A Breath of Fresh Air,8,12 June 2015,"Making a sequel is never easy. Viewers are bound to draw comparisons to the original and make it hard for them to be critiqued in their own right. First entries cast a shadow that a sequel can never escape. Especially when it comes to summer blockbusters.Jurassic Park was one of the most groundbreaking films to ever hit the big screen. From the breathtaking visual effects, to the memorable characters, to the iconic score, it was an instant classic that made a fortune. But with every smash hit movie, a sequel will surely follow. Although the next two installments of the series had their moments, we were relatively underwhelmed by a lack of inventiveness. The main reason the first movie was such a success was due to how new and exciting it all was. Without likable characters or an interesting script, all we're left with is dazzling visuals. Which work, but quickly get repetitive. So where does Jurassic World fit in? Well, if you ask me, Jurassic World is the sequel that Jurassic Park always deserved. Although it stumbles a bit along the way with a few plot holes and character issues, the film is simple and satisfying. Essentially what this movie does is resurrect the setting and a few themes of the first. Hammond's vision for the park has been scaled up and finally built, allowing us to get closer to the dinosaurs than ever before. If stellar visuals and comforting simplicity aren't enough, there is something else this film has to offer that none of the sequels ever gave us: heart. The attachment we feel to the dinosaurs themselves reaches a whole new level that even the first film can't match. Seeing Pratt interact with the raptors was spectacular and wasn't like anything we've seen before. The other sequels felt redundant as they often attempted to recapture the magic of the original. But Jurassic World gives us a well-rounded perspective of what these creatures are. It's refreshing, and brings new life to these movies. Viewers can actually look into the eyes of the animals and begin to feel emotionally attached. Whether they be breathing their last breathe, or simply staring intently at potential human prey, there's a charming personal touch. I think it worked splendidly.While I was very fond of the movie as a whole and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good summer fun, I can't overlook a few problems it has. Unfortunately some of the acting felt wooden at times, particularly from Irrfan Khan who seemed really out of place throughout the entire movie. There are also the plot holes such as cell phone usage to call for help, potential pterodactyl migration, and the lack of an evacuation plan to get visitors off the island safely. The kid characters were also a problem.The kids in the movie really didn't add much to the story. They seemed to be there mainly for dramatic effect. Not only were they unnecessary in my eyes (the best moments are with Pratt and Howard), but also pretty flat and uninteresting. They have story arcs that don't connect to the plot and I didn't feel very invested in them. While they did make for some great sequences, I think those moments could've been written without them. All in all, Jurassic World is a very good movie and a breath of fresh air for the series. The last half hour alone makes seeing it well beyond the value of a ticket. I had a blast, and even if it doesn't live up to the spectacle of Jurassic Park, I got a true taste of 90s nostalgia. With tons of mesmerizing visuals, heartfelt moments, and pulse- pounding action, fans and general audience members have a lot to enjoy. Kids will love it, and adults will too. Go see it!",Jurassic World
859,Samuel_Gilbert,Summer Fun!,7,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World is the 4th instalment in the very popular Jurassic Park franchise. Following the almost perfect Jurassic Park(1993), the good ­ The lost World: Jurassic park(1997) and the alright but worst of the series Jurassic Park III(2001). Right off the bat, this movie is great! This is the definition of summer fun. I think that if you view this movie as a monster movie, you will have an immense fun with it. All from the world building of this movie to the great performance given by Chris Pratt I think that hands down the best sequel we have gotten since the original Jurassic Park. It's also a great family movie that everyone will enjoy. Definitely check this movie out, you will not regret it! The park is finally opened! Have fun!",Jurassic World

I have been hearing a lot of people comparing this movie with the previous titles surrounding Jurassic Park. This one's bit different in all aspects. The story feels quite dull as it unfolds. A lack of action leaves you worrying about the money you have spent on this movie. The story is just OK but doesn't turn out to be sensible at a few places. Jurassic World hardly managed to entertain me. However, actors / actresses have done a pretty good job. So yes, it's entertaining. Good for one-time watch.

862,pnguin-22162,Good and Cheesy...but a little crusty around the edges...,5,12 June 2015,"Watched ""Jurassic World"" Last night and though it was entertaining as most Spielberg associated movies are... it was truly riddled with the errors and issues of a one-off director, just like the Godzilla Reboot was. When is Hollywood going to learn to stick with proved Directors for Major Blockbusters... quit getting your Directors on the cheap...First, lets get into character development... or the serious lack thereof... All the main characters were so one dimensional that once the meat (pun intended) of the movie gets started (waaaaay too early in the movie for my taste), you can't really cheer for any of them except for the dinosaurs.Most Notably horrible are the kids ""Zach and Gray""... oh, why do they cast untalented kids like Ty Simpkins? Just because he got lucky in ""Iron Man 3""???? Well, I think he sunk his rising star with his performance in this movie... from one scene to the next you can't tell if he is lightly autistic, suffering from Asperger's...or just a spoiled little pain in the ass... my vote is with the last choice because *possible spoiler of poor background building* how can a kid go from complaining and crying about if his parents might get a divorce, to serious inquisitive looking out the window in 10 seconds flat??? Had they just eliminated this background story and the kid and just left the older kid ""Zach"" and given him a plot line of saving the two girls he ogled from the ferry boat forward (btw, you never see the two girls again, so you never know what happens to them after they get in their gyrosphere, wtf?!?!) The most likable character is ""Lowery""(Jake Johnson). He is the *spoiler* ""Anti-Nedry"", and one scene will break your heart when you are totally rooting for him, but he manages to pull it together for a humorous outcome...*Spoiler* The person that ends up being the most hated is the one you would least suspect... Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong)... which actually comes as a bit of a surprise that they had his character take on such a calloused persona considering he is the ONLY character brought back from the original movies, and in JP1 he was the most ""naïve"" in his enthusiasm for what he was creating...The rest of the characters are inconsequential one-dimensional plot drivers...On to the actual plot and movie itself... when in interviews, they hinted at nods to the other movies...* spoiler*...I think they were actually saying, ""We got nothing new so we're just gonna take big chunks from the first three and run with it""...because that's exactly what they did...* spoilers* There are remakes of Grant and Malcolm's flare and T-Rex, Nedry's stealing samples (except not so stealthily), entering a dilapidated building (JP2 & 3), and Dr. Sadler's famous ""RUN!"" line. It was nice to tip a hat to one of the original Jeeps in JP1...but there is no way in heck the kids could have gotten it started with (at least) 13 year old gas in its' tank... but now I am just getting persnickety...Overall, its a great way to pass 2 hours of your life and not feel completely taken advantage of... The pace is slow at times (sometimes too slow), and *spoiler* throughout the chase, you will ask yourself, why they never thought to use the neurotoxin used in JP2 (Oh wait, that's right... they decided to act like JP2 & JP3 never happened)... but still if you want to stop a HUGE animal effectively and as efficiently... wouldn't that be your logical choice of weapon against it? *Last Spoiler* How the movie ended, I don't see how they can pull another sequel out of this bag... Maybe they DO bring back Dr. Ian Malcolm and Dr. Grant to... well maybe I should write my own screenplay instead of give them ideas...",Jurassic World
863,alicjaljohnson,Jurassic World,8,19 June 2015,"It's been twenty-two years since the events of Jurassic Park occurred, and the park has reopened – now called ""Jurassic World."" Zach and Gray are going to visit their Aunt Claire, the operations manager of the park. Gray (Ty Simpkins) seems to be a dinosaur fanatic, running to every attraction with his enthusiasm growing each time. It's made clear that Zach (Nick Robinson), the older brother, is unimpressed by the amazing dinosaurs and museum exhibits. He's much more interested in every single teenage girl at the park.Instead of spending time with her nephews, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) prepares for the park's newest attraction/dinosaur that was created by a team of scientists: Indominus Rex. Claire brings in the velociraptor trainer Owen (Chris Pratt) to inspect the creature's paddock for safety clearance before the attraction opens to visitors. Owen and Claire notice scratch marks on the walls of the paddock, making it appear as though Indominus has escaped. This prompts Owen to go inside the paddock for further examination, where he realizes that the creature has just camouflaged herself to trick the humans. Narrowly escaping a gruesome death, Owen is able to flee the paddock. But so does the dinosaur, who proves to be a ruthless machine, killing everything that moves.If you haven't seen the previews for Jurassic World or lack the common sense to figure out that this creation will become trouble, the name gives it away. In Latin, ""indominus Rex"" literally means ""untamable king"". The Indominus proves to live up to her name. Not only is she dangerous in her nature, she is also dangerously intelligent which proves her to be a formidable foe for the visitors and workers at Jurassic World.Jurassic World is the only film I've seen directed by Colin Trevorrow, and I think that he did a good job with it. He creates a perfect balance of action, suspense, and comedy. The film's plot is engaging and fast-paced, with the viewer being hooked in right away. Trevorrow ventures many themes with this film and begs many difficult questions, one of which being: How far will corporations go for monetary profit? The creation of a killing machine to keep profits up at a theme park provides the chilling response: too far.Chris Pratt won my favor as the hero in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, and my adoration of him has only grown after seen him as the bad-ass, smart- mouthed but kind-hearted alpha raptor. Pratt was well cast for this role. As for Howard, I'm not sure whether I didn't like her acting or just didn't like her character. There was something about the fact that she was running around a forest in a pair of stilettos and a white ensemble that turned me off about her. I was surprised to see Jake Johnson in the cast, playing an operator at the park. Johnson does a great performance, providing a conscience for the characters in the film.Michael Giacchino's score deserves a mention; it's spot on. The music seamlessly adds to the wonders of the setting, doubles the horror where appropriate, and reminds one of Williams's score for Jurassic Park.Jurassic Park is a phenomenal movie. I never saw the second and third installments, but I've been told that I'm not missing out. Jurassic World, however, is a worthy addition to the franchise that can be appreciated by all ages.",Jurassic World
864,jkl_football,Welcome To Jurassic World,6,20 June 2015,"This is a good addition to the movie series! I give it a six out of ten because you can tell that this whole movie was filmed with green screens and ALL C.G.I. I understand special effects are needed but in the original 3 films there were robot puppets as the dinosaurs. I will say this though if you are a fan of the movie series you will enjoy yourself. There are only a few parts that will make you get chills or make you clap. You can never compare the original to the sequels but the new dinosaur is not very impressive I'm referring to the original when we first met the T-Rex it was the most awesome thing ever! You can predict almost everything that will happen. The way they used the T-Rex was a total disgrace to what Spielberg created it to be. Along with the raptors great idea don't get me wrong but they did not improve on it as good as they could have. Overall if Jurassic Park wasn't your favorite movie as a kid you probably won't take much interest, but it is very intense and at times pretty bloody I was shocked by that. If you love Jurassic Park you'll like this movie but if not don't expect too much.",Jurassic World
865,sakurakitsune,Terribly predictable.,4,21 June 2015,"Let me clear the air on this. When I first heard about a new Jurassic Park movie (back in 2006), We already had heard word it was going to be called ""Jurassic World"" But we didn't know about it and plans for the movie were still in the beginning phases, it didn't help that 2 years later Micheal Crichton died and all word about another Jurassic Park movie went silent. Now (2015) several months before the release, I heard word again about Jurassic World. It brought back thoughts I had in 2006 that it would be another flop like ""Jurassic Park III"" After finding the first teaser trailer and seeing the Jurassic World website and going so far to create a few more fictional websites to really dig in and build up the internal universe of the movie I thought ""Ok maybe this will be good after all"" since they were going the extra mile to bring more of the fiction to reality.I went in with high hopes since they were trying to make this feel as real as possible and I pushed aside the thoughts I had years and months back, So I went into the theater with expectations up rather high, yet I came out saddened, it wasn't good at all. I over-hyped myself hoping it would be good. Yet it didn't deliver. Maybe I'm jaded by the original Jurassic Park and the Micheal Crichton Novels. But there was seriously no magic to this film.The first Jurassic Park was magical since it was one of the first films to display dinosaurs in a way we had never seen before. Before Jurassic Park, all we had was Claymation. Jurassic Park was one of the first films to display dinosaurs realistically. Today it is dated, but it still holds that magic every time you see it. It was a rather magical thrill ride.The second film ""The Lost World"" while it wasn't as good as the first one, it wanted to continue the story of International Genetics (Ingen) and wanting to bring John Hammond's Dream to life except this time in California at an abandoned Jurassic Park Amphitheater. And it had some of the magic but it was very much a fast paced action adventure ride that was hanging on the coat tails of the first film.The Third one cut out the ingen storyline, but continued the idea that man should not try to play god with genetic engineering. It left itself down to being a fast paced action ride instead. Which is really the beginning of the end of the Jurassic Park franchise.The new one tries way to hard to capture the magic of the first one and try to pretty much retell the story of Jurassic Park again except with an opened theme park, and even bring back Ingen as a security/military division of the Masrani Company that acquired it some years back (based on the fictional details from the Jurassic World website and the tie in fictional Masrani company website.)And seems they automatically went back to square one with Ingen. Instead of having learned the lessons of John Hammond and his nephew from the second film, they are back and intend to do more than just help the Masrani company with there Jurassic World theme park, they have other intentions that involve certain modified Dinosaur Embryo's.And just like with the last film they have to introduce an even bigger bad ass dinosaur that can outclass the T-Rex. Except... This new one isn't an actual dinosaur with fossil records, this one is a 100% engineered dinosaur based on several creatures rather than that a dinosaur that has a bit of frog DNA to help recreate it. And I'm not spoiling anything by saying this. This is stuff that can be found on the Jurassic World website. Stuff you could pick up before the films release.The story is the biggest problem I have with it. It's utterly predictable, with what seems to be a bunch of idiots that seem to have failed to understand WHY the original Jurassic Park failed. Not only are they so over confident and seem to have no humility at the fact at a possibility the park COULD fail. Especially with the genetic engineering of there animals (remember the first film?)... But that the filmmakers had to sneak a hint in early on in the film to blatantly state ""Murphy's Law is about to happen people,"" I mean I kinda had expected the film would be a little predictable and follow the formula of the last 3 films, I didn't expect the film to shove it in my face about 10 minutes into the film to tell me it's going to be predictable.And from there it's just the same old formula. Boys go to park, Wowed by attractions, Park owners over confident and inept, Something happens, People get killed, Dinosaurs on lose, all hell breaks lose, boys get lost, boys found and get back to park, park is being rampaged by dinosaurs, They somehow escape the island, Not a single one of the main characters your suppose to care about die at the end, literally the end.If you think I spoiled anything there. I honestly didn't. The movie is THAT PREDICTABLE! It's as predictable as any of the teen slasher movies like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Halloween"", even ""Scream"".Do yourself a favor and save your money, wait till this thing is out at Redbox or even Netflix and then make your decision on whether you like it or not.Because it is not worth seeing in theaters.",Jurassic World
866,quick_connor,Very entertaining fun movie that does the Jurassic films justice!,8,8 July 2015,"Jurassic World is a very cool, fresh, and fun movie for new, and old fans of all the films. Jurassic World gives us cool nods and references from the first film. Watching it you cannot help but smile from hearing John Williams original score, and then with new good stuff from Michael Giacchino! Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt are the two leads of the movie and fit into it well! But the thing that separates this from the other films is how action packed it is. Now is this a bad thing....hard to say, for this movie in particular not at all, but I'm curious on the direction of the future...no spoilers....but back to other points, the Indominous Rex is used cleverly as the monster of the movie, and the climax at the end is worth the watch in theaters! overall I hope everyone enjoys the ride that is Jurassic World! I gave it a 8/10 and in my opinion is the 2nd best of all Jurassic films as the original never the less still captivates best! Hope this helps, and enjoy the show!!",Jurassic World
867,carsonhuelle,The 4th Highest-Grossing Film Ever,4,16 January 2018,"Jurassic World, the sequel we all wanted? My response to this question would be no. This movie does remind us of one thing for sure though, Spielberg knew how to not rely on CGI, and still have an entertaining story and well-rounded characters. That is the biggest issue that I have with this movie. Jurassic World's director, Colin Trevorrow thrives in one of those categories and lacks in the others. Our lead actors Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) are perfectly fine, but it seems that there is something holding them back. Maybe it is the four writers this movie had? Or maybe it is the constant product placement that is used. This problem continues throughout the movie with some of the supporting actors as well. We get a bland underdeveloped teen (Zach) that is focused on his phone and girls, and his little brother (Gray) who is fine but predictable. At times, the movie had me entertained though. I think there is something about dinosaurs that amazes us all, considering this is the 4th installment of a ""Jurassic Park"" movie. Audiences want to see these huge creatures tear people up, and I am with those people. The CGI is nice, and we get to see new dinosaurs like the Mosasaurus who refreshing and is good for marketing the movie. I can respect the fun that this movie is, but is hard to take seriously when you can see through the whole marketing gimmick that this movie is. I guess the gimmick worked though, $1.6 billion dollars later. If you want a brainless movie that doesn't provide much thought process, go for Jurassic World. I would just recommend re-watching it's predecessor, ""Jurassic Park"" to remind yourself the genius of Spielberg and not Trevorrow.",Jurassic World

I was just hoping this film would keep me awake, luckily within the first 15 mins of this film I was already attached to the characters and as the film carried on you could start to tell what suddenly was going to happen for the two characters Zach and Gray. At this point I was literally yelling at the screen telling the characters to either 'watch out', 'run' or 'move out of the way'. I'm pretty sure I ended up waking the guy next to me up, but I didn't really care at that point I was too busy watching this movie to really notice. As soon as I finished this movie I was shouting at my brother on a different row to watch this film because it was one of the best I had ever seen, I was literally in love!!!",Jurassic World
869,elouvennachar-14934,Jurassic World,8,27 February 2016,"Jurassic World isn't a movie with a lot of depth into it, before watching it you should consider it as a typical summer blockbuster and not a psychological film with a deep moral behind it. That being said, Jurassic World will deliver a two hours thrill ride.Jurassic World is a luxury resort or a theme park containing dinosaurs in Isla Nublar. The action takes place 22 years after the incident that happened in the original movie ( Jurassic Park ). The owner is Simon Masrani and his goal was to complete John Hammond's dream ( create a fully functioning dinosaur theme park ). And he did, but people started to see dinosaurs as something that is completely normal with time, and so InGen decided to create a new attraction ( bigger, louder, more teeth ). The beast was made and managed to escape its cage later by using its incredible intelligence. Turns out it was all planned out by Vic Hoskins and Dr.Wu and the idea behind it was to test dinosaur as military units.The characters in the movie are not really likable at first but by the end of the movie you'll have some kind of affection towards them. It is probably due to the lack of character development, even though Owen Grady is a really interesting one. The acting was good, not great but good. It was acceptable and didn't really affect the enjoyment you get out of this movie. Now visual effects were great, I hear a lot of people have been complaining about the CGI but I found it to be flawless and barely could find the difference between it and animatronics. To summarize what I've just said, this movie is totally worth it, at least for dinosaur fans and really brings back awesome memories. Watching it for the first time in theaters was an unforgettable experience ! Don't let some of the negative reviews bring you down, give it a try ! Final verdict : A solid 9/10",Jurassic World
870,jnsftsdj,"A well made film, with some blunders.",7,27 April 2021,"This as I said its a very well made film, incredible atmosphere, realistic dinosaurs, surprisingly a bit of violence, I thought it will be zero violent family film, this films technique is well matched to not be too violent, that's a plus to me because it still is family friendly, it is a bit scary, very smart jumpscares, small scary -exciting parts, but I cannot ignore that a big production and a well-made film like this, has silly scenes like the company's about to be ruined and people getting killed and they are talking like it's a simple problem, or the main actress she is talking to her nephews, crying but calmly in the middle of chaos, people were running around for their life's, you can even see Chris Patt looking at them behind, so calm, the bad guys had like no safety plan, with dangerous dinosaurs everywhere, the bad guy was talking again calmly about his plan , next minute he gets eaten,inside the laboratory ,also the fact that Patt had a great relationship with the little dinosaurs but when they died for him they didn't even show an appreciation emotional scene.",Jurassic World

The plot is thin at best, the acting is just so, so horrible, the jokes didn't work, bar one. The cgi wasn't all that bad, however it was not an improvement on the first films. Even Vincent (d'onofrio) couldn't save this movie and it was predictable beyond belief. (Spoilers start here) The relationship between the two sisters is so badly done, also, the love between the smaller brother and the big brother didn't take effect.

The plot pays homage to the original 'Jurassic Park' series and it did it well. The jokes in this film were great, and the plot is great also. The acting in this film was good, and the score was just amazing. The only thing(s) that I didn't like about the film is when some of the characters just acted dumb.
The CGI in this film was great and...... yeah, I really can't say more about it. Its just great. I give this a 8/10. If I could, I would consider watching it in theater again.",Jurassic World

I can't believe that this is the film with the highest gross at opening, first one to get to a $1-billion in ticket revenue the fastest, etc. It is a dog. The acting is atrocious or, to be fair, the writing is plain bad: ""I'm not a Navajo, I'm Navy,"" says the protagonist when asked by the supposed expert on the park (who instantly turns from business shark into a giggling girl idiot), if he could 'smell' the dinosaur laying waste to the park.

With enhanced tech, the grandeur of Isla Nublar looks greener and spectacular. A solid build up that leads to many edge of the seat moments is done to great effect here. Cameras work to enhance 3D in every possible way. Effortless direction that makes it a near most rewrite of the franchise while paying due homage to past films is the highlight of the film. Today, when the CGI laden, similarly executed superhero films are becoming an overkill, Jurassic World is an absolute delight to watch! Talking about performances, its Dino power this time. Clichéd script, cheesy dialogues and C line of actors? Who cares! There are enough teeth this time...literally! Climax proves it with a bang!

Now, I'm not a huge fan of the first three films, but, in all honesty, Jurassic World kicks butt; it sports all the necessary elements for a very re-watchable piece of entertainment: it's bigger, faster and louder and contains some powerful cheering moments.
This could have suffered the same fate as Jurassic Park: The Lost World but thanks to the heady approach of sequel/reboot, Jurassic World feels fresh and stands its own, you don't have to have seen the previous installments and you won't have to watch the next.
This is what I called the perfect pop-corn film: wholly enjoyable, re-watchable and leaves wanting you more.

Chris Pratt is great in his role(like his humour and charisma), Bryce Dallas Howard character is unlikable at Ist but as movie progress,the character totally fits into it.I like the connection b/w Raptors and Chris Pratt character. Its good to see an Indian ""Irrfan Khan"" in significant role in this big budget Hollywood movie. Despite some flows, i have a good time in watching this movie and last half-n-hour-n-so is great and teaches us if you play with nature, nature will play with u at Ist but will rescue form it(a every disaster,monster movie does).

879,HaggieMonster,So glad that I illegally downloaded this crapfest,3,29 June 2015,"If I had paid money to see this, I would have been furious. The plot wavers back and forth between non-existent and idiotic. The characters are so generic and predictable that you know what each of them is going to do within 10 seconds of seeing them on screen. By 10-15 minutes into the movie, you are actually rooting for the dinosaurs to eat EVERYONE including the producers, writers, and studio executives who signed off on this crapfest. When I saw the opening weekend box office numbers, I was appalled. It does not say much about American intellect that a movie this horrible can set box office records. This movie was a scam. How little do we have to do to fleece the audience out of a half billion dollars in one weekend?Are we, as a nation, this stupid?",Jurassic World
880,shaun_sat,Fun film but fails to give us the wonder the original film did,8,11 June 2015,"This movie is supposed to be a sequel to the original Jurassic Park, but it seems to be more of a reboot. Its core message remains the same, don't mess with nature. In the original, we were treated to not only great CGI and special effects, but very memorable characters and great acting. This time around, the acting is the worst part of the movie. I was disappointed with Chris Pratt's performance as the Velociraptor trainer was very wooden, a bad mix of trying to be seen as a fierce hunter and a source of some funny one-liners. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are supposed to play brothers, but do a terrible job of it, making it seem like they just met that very day. But the worst performance of the film would be Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing, the park operations manager. I could not tell what her character's role in the film was other than to look shocked at the events of the film. And she had no chemistry with Pratt's character, their romance seemed forced, and quite unnecessary. There are also a few misplaced scenes in the movie. In one of them, the younger Mitchell brother confides to his elder of his worry that his parents might divorce and his brother comforts him. The scene is completely redundant. It does not add to the characters' personalities nor does it have any bearing on the rest of the movie, as his parents' have very little screen time anyway. With all these flaws, why do I give this movie 8 stars? It is because the effects and action in this movie are so incredible that they eclipse the bad acting and corny attempts at touching our emotions. Really, the dinosaurs look so real, and the way the action scenes are directed, you feel as they might just burst out of the screen any second. Watch out for one particular scene with the mosasaur(the big water dinosaur) and pteranodons(the flying ones). After all, if you're planning to watch this movie, you're going to be more concerned whether the dinosaurs kick ass more than anything else. I have no regrets watching this in the cinema, it's a good summer blockbuster. But will it have the same cultural impact Jurassic Park had? No. In a few months, everyone will forget about Jurassic World and go back to watching Spielberg's original.",Jurassic World

The main character is pretty amazing and is a really cool guy and overall great acting from him (Chris Pratt) and it does have nostalgic feelings from the original Jurassic Park however I have rated it 4/10 because 3 of the 4 raptors died and that is very sad and disheartening and to be honest in a few days that other raptor would of probably been hunted down by some government and killed anyway, not only that he was on his own too. My ending to the movie would of been the 4 raptors distract the Rex long enough for the annoying kids and bad aunt to get into a safer place while Chris Pratt finds an ingenious way to lure the Rex over to the water and let the Mosasaurus deal with it instead and the raptors walk away free and run off into the wild and then just before the credits roll it an announcement saying that Jurassic World will be left alone to the dinosaurs and creatures inhabiting it however the work Ingen and the genetics lab done would be completely abolished and Jurassic World will be left as a reminder that dinosaurs were dead for a reason. That is my alternate ending that I have come up with to keep the raptors alive. My version 9/10, Raptor Slaughter version 4/10",Jurassic World

I sincerely hope it does.So, if you can shut off THAT part of your brain, you will probably enjoy it.

I had a lot fun watching this movie and I wasn't bored once. It's also the first time I ever saw a Jurassic Park film on the big screen. I loved the Easter eggs to the original Jurassic Park (1993) and the way they used the theme song. I got goosebumps when I heard the theme rushing through my ears. I have one big nitpick. And that is I was let down by the effects. The effects looked amazing but I was let down that they didn't really use practical effects like in the original and The Lost World And there was no Jeff Goldblum cameo! Anyway, the movie isn't perfect. Far from being perfect to say the least. But we go to the movies to have fun and great time. Jurassic World did that for me.",Jurassic World

Call me a sell-out for nostalgia, but when that ol' music comes on and were getting ready to enter the park, I was having a moment with my 6 yr old self.

I KNOW many other viewers had to feel at least some of that, esp the folks from my generation.I don't want to give details away, but TRUST me, they haven't given away every exciting moment and set-piece in the trailers as is so often the case nowadays. There's quite a few interesting surprises and callbacks that had me giddy. At 28 yrs old I don't often have reason to be giddy, but this movie had me from beginning to end. The 3D was worth it, very well done. Bet it was even cooler in IMAX, but where I live the only IMAX theater in the state is almost 3 hrs away unfortunately..Is this movie on par with the first film?

888,kryzhan,Don't discount the fantastic and fantasy because unrealistic,9,13 June 2015,"I wouldn't exactly expect a Velociraptor to learn to react or trust a human similar to lets say a dog but dispensing with this disbelief Jurassic Park World is everything the others could not be, primarily due to the advance in capability with CGI. But so many are detracting due to the ability of the raptor / human relationship let's examine that a little further. It is unfair to say that raptors are dumb or smart, how do we truly know. All Jurassic film's have all capitalized on the notion that they can coordinate their attacks, like pack animals, life wolves. Raptors lean more towards being Edison in the films; they ain't exactly Dan Quayle. Back to reality, raptors would have acted mainly through ""instinct"". Whether or not in reality if raptors could be perceptive of their environment, I don't think science or paleontology will ever know. To parlay into today's world, not Jurassic World, a lot of snakekeepers say when they go to their rattlesnakes, the snakes act calm and normal. But when other people try to approach them, they rattle vigorously and take defensive poses. Although it's nice to think that snakes have emotions (like joy, anger, and affection), scientific studies show that snakes just don't have the cerebral capacity for them. However, snakes do have ""primitive"" feelings like aggression, fear, and pleasure. Snakes are able to learn simple things such as tolerating handling, eating an unnatural food item, and of course, adapting to captivity. But to teach a snake to learn things like to ""fetch"" (like a dog can), or ""sit-stay"" is not relevant to snakes. So the jump in disbelief is when just that proffered with raptors in Jurassic World. Get beyond that and the movie is a rip roaring affair. Lining up the 4 Jurassic film this one stands heads above the others as far as wow factor from a pure dinosaur perspective. Not to discount the first three films. This one had humor, solid acting and a Mosasaur. That Mosasaur almost steals the show and plays a few key scenes in the film and is satisfying in a sort of mixed feeling way. Same mixed feeling for the raptors and T-Rex. Do you root for Godzilla when a common foe appears? Enjoy the film for what it brings, unapologizing freaky experience with the largest creatures known to have walked this planet. You could say, could happen, could happen, could happen, probably couldn't happen, could happen and walk away laughing at some poignant human interaction that makes fun of clichés and a rousing, blood pumping reptilian romp through Isla Nublar, this scary and wondrous tropical island isolated somewhere in a Central American locale.",Jurassic World
889,CraftMuch,"Better effects, better movie?",6,14 June 2015,"It's clear to see when a film is a cash grab; big cast, big effects and an already established name always helps. It seems like the ""Jurassic"" franchise worked its way onto this bus a while back and never stepped off. It's a shame to say that even by today's movie standards ""Jurassic World"" wasn't the end of the road for the series, even today's CGI couldn't save it (Might have even been what killed it?).This film is a stellar example as to why rehashing and rebooting movies doesn't work when you don't change anything... Now actually, that's not fair really, I mean this film did change things, for starts it removed nearly all the practical effects we cherished in the original, it also featured a lot more running (Because why not), it aimed to make dinosaurs more human and more relatable (Clearly because the first movie shamed them so much) and I almost forgot (Probably because it's so insignificant) the films called ""Jurassic World"" not ""Jurassic Park"".To be honest though I knew what to expect, I think most people knew this franchise had been going nowhere since they went to the pictures in 1997. So I can't rate it really badly because that would assume that I expected this film to be great and I didn't. It was actually a great average film, nothing more nothing less, well maybe a bit less.Conclusion: What you see is what you get, you don't like it, well...",Jurassic World

I was very excited for this movie as it looked like it would be fun to see and I really liked the first ""Jurassic Park"", the other two weren't the best. This movies CGI looked great and it just seemed like it was real entertainment. And I was right!! The movie was really enjoyable and it wasn't my favorite movie, mainly because it has already been done before, but it was a great time in the theater. The movie was a lot like the first mainly because you can't really do much with the story if you're making another movie with the same idea. This movie I couldn't really see being done better, because I don't really think that they should make too many more of these movies as they'll get old fast. I can relate it to the Transformers franchise, it started out fun and enjoyable, but as the years went on the more movies they were making the worse they got. The movie was everything I hoped it would be. I know it sounds like I'm really contradicting myself, because I said it was good not great, but that's what I thought it would be, and that's what it was. I think there are many movies that I've seen that are very good movies, but they aren't very enjoyable like ""Jurassic World"". ""Jurassic World"" was a movie that has a very high replay value as it is a movie that I would want to watch over and over unlike many movies that I've seen that I thought were very good. ""Jurassic World"" was a fun movie and really helped people understand why they say movies are entertainment. It's not a movie that just tries to teach you something for two hours, it's a movie that is purely for enjoyment and it did a good job in that aspect.",Jurassic World
892,doggett-clint,More Focus on Animatronics Would Have Made it Better,9,27 June 2015,"I am kinda surprised to see all the negative reviews here. All things considered for a 4th installment, it was highly entertaining and it held true to the original franchise. I wasn't sure what to expect going in but I came out so satisfied! First off, they did pay homage to the original animatronics in some scenes. The original animatronic artist didn't return, but some new guy did a pretty good job. When it comes to movie making I believe in traditional means-- having REAL THINGS ON CAMERA. It allows the actors to actually react to something instead of pretending in front of a green screen. It also lets the audience buy into the story. Although, I was disappointed because I know they could have used it more, so shame on them. They didn't totally sellout into CG like Peter Jackson, but they could have done better. After watching the 4th, I went back and watched the original Jurassic Park and the animatronics still look SO GOOD. I just wish the Jurassic World crew would have taken advantage of the opportunity. Next, the raptors. Always man, always with the raptors haha. This movie kept the original respect for the raptors in good taste (because they were allegedly so smart, even though we really have no scientific idea haha). Anyhow, the raptors were more of actual characters than just monsters in this one. I admired the twist. The raptor movement has improved substantially since the original, it was less jerky and awkward looking. But that is also because they were using CG.Now, Chris Pratt was a swell fit for the comedic relief; there is one character in every movie for that. I did miss Dr. Malcolm though. But they were able to take the idea of a Jurassic Park a step further and ACTUALLY HAVE A FUNCTIONAL PARK haha. So it allows you to see a side of the plot that never existed in the first three.As far as the plot goes, obviously its just a bunch of people running from dinosaurs, but they still captured the original terror of it all, ya know? I mean Jurassic Park was frightening as a kid, and this movie kinda threw me back into my childhood of imaginative horror. I used to be afraid that freaking T-Rex was gonna tear threw my wall and eat my family. If you are, or ever were a fan of Jurassic Park, this is a must see. If not, it is still worth the sheer entertainment of Man vs Beast. Nature finds a way...PS I can't wait for a Jurassic movie in 4D, where they let people onto Isla Nubar and see if they can survive for 2 hours. :)",Jurassic World
893,AdielMayuni,"Loved the beginning, hated the end",6,14 July 2015,"I hate it when animals die in movies. I especially hate it when no one cares about it. Owen (Chris Pratt) seemed to care for his raptors all the movie, but in the end when all four died he couldn't care less? No tear, not even a word. Isn't it inconsistency? I didn't recognize Bryce Dallas Howard at all, I thought it was Kristen Bell? I liked Nick Robinson's acting, it was on point. Couldn't stand Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio). Couldn't wait for for him to be bitten by a dinosaur. In terms of CGI and special effects, they we're on point too. The textures looked real, same with the animals movement and so on. The movie isn't bad, but it is a waste of time. Kinda like Into The Woods. Both have a weird ending. I defiantly didn't get my desired ending.",Jurassic World
894,KeithNg,ROARRRR! Finally a worthy follow to the original Jurassic park.,8,11 June 2015,"Lets start of by saying this movie is thoroughly enjoyable. Who can resist to watch the followup of the 1993 classic? If you didn't happen to like the lost world and jurassic part 3, then it should relief you that the events in those two followups have been ignored in jurassic world. Was this a good movie? Yes, definitely. But did it have the magic of the original JP? Sort of... but it did have its flaws. \Lets start of with the good. This movie made many Jurassic park references. Thats why i can't help but compare the two. (which is an honour for this movie) Touching the dying dinosaur, seeing the raptor image on the wall, raptors fighting the big Rex... At points, the references really brought back memories that tears were brought to my eyes. Moving on from the references, the movie was fast paced. At least after the first 30mins. There was LOTS of action. Furthermore, I liked the concept of having a relationship with the dinosaurs. Yes, it sounds cheesy, but the scene where a raptor was running in slow motion, coming to the rescue is just irresistible. If you're a dinosaur fan like me, this movie would be so easy to fall in love with. Even if you're not, its easy to get caught up in the excitement of it. Of course throughout the movie there were a few moments of comedic relief too. I also have to give credits to the cgi. It was great. The scene whereby the indominous rex camouflaged among the trees blew me away. Now for the bad parts, the human roles were so standard. A macho male lead, two children in distress... Your standard cast. I know the movie is about the dinosaurs but it wouldn't hurt to have some great humans. Its not like they can steal the limelight or focus from the dino's anyway. Speaking of focus, there were some sub plots like the children family that shouldn't have been there. The director probably wanted to show how this event bonded family but still, the sub plot felt so disconnected from the movie. Also, when they first played the jurassic park theme, I was expecting to see some grand dinosaurs. Instead, I saw buildings. ZZZNow here comes the in between part. The parts where I can't decide whether its good or bad. First, despite liking dins and humans having a relationship, it still seems a little convenient that the raptors have the brain to choose to befriend and help the humans. There one of the smartest dinosaurs but even so, they're supposed to be stupider than the average animal. Even the T rex felt kind of convenient. After taking down the indominous rex, it just left. Didn't attack the humans. And on to the indominous rex. Its more of a monster than a dinosaur. It kills for sport! Not to eat. The ending too may be seen as assail by some. The sudden attack of the mosasaurus ending the fight in two seconds. The masseurs shouldn't even be that big. Like it can even grasp the indominous Rex in its jaws and drag it into the water??!! If thats the case, it can have its own movie with it as the antogonists. It can be the new jaws.With all that being said, this is still a great movie. If you do not compare this to the first and understand that all movie has flaws, the movie would be more than decent. There conflicts when the script was made so I can understand why the movie might not have flowed so smoothly. Other than that, dinosaur fans are in for a blast! There are more dino on dino action here:)",Jurassic World
895,katelynmanning,Best in The series,6,13 June 2015,"This is by far,THE best movie in this entire series (so far anyway), and is a must see for anyone who is into any type of movie.Seriously.Any type.At first I was like ""this is just going to be another typical Jurrassic Park movie where the big guy with the big muscles (Chris Pratt in this case) does all the work and the girl just screams and gets in the way."" I was wrong. Instead of the usually ,slightly sexist portrayal of a scared woman who gets in the way.This was a portrayal of a scared woman who kicks serious ass!!This movie is visually stunning and a will leave you feeling disappointed that you weren't attacked on the way home by a T-Rex. I highly recommend this movie an the only reason I'm not giving it a nine ,is that it was quite slow to get into it. But trust me.When it gets going it's great.",Jurassic World
896,hailhydra86,As bad as one of those Dinocroc vs. Supergator type movies,4,2 July 2015,"I see a lot of people (rightly so) asking about the two unmentioned movies in the franchise in this sequel for anyone that wants clarification heres my gist of it. Jurassic Park happens The Lost World happens Jurassic Park 3 happens Jurassic World happens Jurassic World is ""the sequel"" to Jurassic Park. But, it is not ignoring The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. While neither sequel is referenced in the film, their events have been referenced in the film's promotional materials and viral marketing. For example, the San Diego incident is mentioned, John Hammond died shortly after the events of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. In real life, Richard Attenborough died of natural causes on 24 August 2014, aged 90. There is a Hammond's memorial statue in the Innovation Center in this film, in a feature introducing the character Vic Hoskins, it's revealed his team did work involving flying dinosaurs, referring the Pteranadons that escaped at the end of Jurassic Park III. The bones of a Spinosaurus can be seen in the main plaza of the park. T-Rex is even shown to smash through them during the final fight. As a way to show that the T-Rex is still the king of the dinosaurs. In a likely reference to the fan complaints that the T-Rex was killed by the Spinosaurus in Jurassic Park III. Read and digest that how ever you like, all it was and is, is an article that came out saying that the director said it is the sequel to Jurassic Park.. you don't say. It feels and resembles lots to do with Jurassic Park... wow really? D'oh. The island in which the events of Jurassic Park happened, happened on Island Nublar in which Jurassic World happens. This means you do not need anything to do with The Lost World: Jurassic Park or Jurassic Park III because they happened on Isla Sorna/Site B. The sequel to Jurassic World will most likely revisit this island, as well as mention, what probably is happening on the island in Jurassic World.. its not that hard to just suspend your disbelief for a bit until you get your answers. Oh and the books are different to the movies. Savvy? Groovy. Glad I could help. Thank you for your cooperation. Jurassic World were like a SyFy film. We have dinosaurs used for war. Really? I were expecting the rap tors to say ""Alan"" at one point or riding a bike. Literally as bad as one of those Dinocroc vs. Supergator type movies. Bad CGI. Bad acting. A complete embarrassment to all involved. It's only saving grace is that it's occasionally so bad that it's kind of funny. And the Jurassic Park theme. The music still moves me to this day. They should not use it for nostalgia. John Williams has not written a hummable tune since Jurassic Park! I want to hear a new Jurassic Park theme! They are just trying to make the stuff that is already been done, to be groovy.",Jurassic World
897,Dana_Sibilsky,It's alright,5,2 September 2015,"Before getting into this review, let's take a take a step or two back in time to the first and 2nd films in the 90's. Considering it was a movie about jurassic beasts thirsty for blood, they did an excellent job making the dead people...well, dead. In other words, It was very graphic. I remember in the 2nd movie, a man gets ripped apart between two T-Rex's and you do see intestines. So for the realism of those movie, I give it two thumbs up!Moving on to Jurassic World, I watched this movie expecting a lot of people to die in gruesome ways because of the realistic theme the last two movies carried on. If you're a fan of realism, bloodshed and dismemberment, I'm sorry to say you don't get that in this movie. The Pros: Great acting, interesting story twist of a new hybrid dinosaur, danger, dinosaur fights, chaos, breath-holding suspense. excellent effects and CGI.The Cons: Scary scenes not fit for young ones (duh), not as graphic/bloody (personal preference).In conclusion, it's a great watch, but I don't believe it fits into the scary, suspenseful theme the past Jurassic Park movies created.",Jurassic World

900,pozahedi,No authenticity,6,14 July 2018,"As a pure dino's fan I was upset by many aspect of the film. First of all, the main attraction is based on a dinosaure that has never existed. This kind of movie should bring to the audiance some knowledge in science and not creating hybrid monster to make the movie scarier.Secondly I can't support when they try to put some emotions in the eyes of a T- Rex or a velociraptor. Those are lizards...they remain reptils, not mammals. The emotion should be brought by the actors which didn't make a good job. A super hero navy seal and a bimbo are not appropriate to be the main character of this movie. Laura Dern and Sam Neil were more authentic and didn't try to be funny when it wasn't necessary.Finally slow motion in a dinosaur fight is completely useless and make the scene less intense. In conclusion apart from all these criticisms, that's a quite good action film (with some excinting moment I must admit) which will delight those who are not dino connoisseurs",Jurassic World
901,bonekeep,Could have a been a disaster... turned out pretty decent.,7,19 June 2015,"A franchise that hit rock bottom with Jurassic Park 3, writers that don't include a Crichton, and a relatively unknown director that's decidedly not a Spielberg... this film had all the markings of a huge disaster. That said, it was actually an enjoyable summer blockbuster. The plot is poor and completely predictable, pretty much a rehashing of Jurassic Park 1 & 2 without the character development or the moralizing, but the acting and the direction were more than passable, certainly far better than the third installment. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were decent with pretty hollow characters to work with. But lets be real, this movie is about the graphics... ferocious dinosaurs on the hunt and that's where this flick makes up for it's shortcomings. Flawless CGI shows off what two decades of technology can do for you. Not that the original doesn't hold up because it does quite well, but its amazing what is possible now. I was hesitant to catch JW in 3D, but ultimately opted for IMAX and glad I did, if only for the scenes with the top down view of the Mosasauraus leaping out of the water to snag its meal. This shot is shown in the trailer but seeing it in 3D is alone worth the price of admission. If you're looking for well made cinema, this film is definitely not for you... but if you're looking for a fun monster flick with eye-popping visuals, Jurassic World will definitely do.",Jurassic World
902,bromomentomemento,The definition of an average movie,5,16 April 2021,"How can you criticize commercialism while advertizing actual brands? At least have the integrity to use fake brands like they did in The Truman Show. Besides this immense oversight, you could sum this movie up with two particular segments where the recognizable soundtrack comes in: in the original, those themes are used to introduce a helicopter descending down an immense waterfall and the characters seeing a miracle (real living dinosaurs) for the first time, here they are used to introduce a helicopter landing in front of a regular building and the characters seeing the mesosaurus tank (without the mesosaurus) for the first time. It's a hollow product capitalizing on its predecessor's success, lacking most of what made the original a classic, but entertaining nonetheless.",Jurassic World

Hard to explain why, though, but to me, the atmosphere of the previous movies was left away. Let alone the fact that to my mind the director(s?) did a shitty job. In my opinion, we, as viewers, see too much of the creatures. At least, the former movies kept our breath for long minutes before actually seeing a dinosaur. Yeah, I think that's what lead me to rate that movie 1/10 on IMDb. Cause we see too much, too early i the movie, and that absolutely nothing makes sense. I remember sometime they refer to the RIP actor John Hammond. So much needed to be explained, ad CERTAINLY NOT SHOWN I THE 25 FIRST MINUTES, for that movie to reach success.

904,jfoldeak,I'm sure you work too hard for your money to have it wasted on this movie.,1,20 June 2015,"I loved Jurassic Park. I remember being moved by the original. I was left with a sense of wonder, and left the theater checking over my shoulder for dinosaurs. All the things that made Jurassic Park great are missing from this. What we are left with is a rehashed plot, awful writing, poor acting, and bad CGI (how is it possible this movie looks worse than the 20 year old original?) Summer popcorn movies may not be meant to be Oscar-worthy, but we should expect more of them than this. While I understand, I am genuinely depressed that this movie is making the money it is. I wanted to see Jurassic Park reopened bigger and better. In the end, I find myself thinking how right Jeff Goldblum's character was in the original. The filmmakers got so caught up in whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think whether or not they should.

At any time, the main dinosaur is never shown clearly in any shot - perhaps at night / behind the trees / etc. Despite the crisis around, people seem to be unbelievably cool, relaxed, in their senses, and cracking jokes?! The story line is cheesy...there is nothing new in it. Direction is faulty at many places - why is the female actor running in high heals? Who asked the Dude to take binoculars in hand to monitor the bad guy? When does the bad dino become good? Why are the two kids so okay with the killing around? Why are their faces and clothes clean and tugged in? Whats with the dude who is in in dire need of a girl friend? I expected this movie to remind me of Jurassic Park - I. It failed to do so.

906,JeffBatHome,"""Jurassic World"" is a serious candidate for the ""Honest Trailers"" website",5,4 July 2015,"Full of spoilers. Read this only if you have already seen the movie or you can't remember stuff.""Jurassic World"" is completely satisfying. It must be; it's made 3x the $$ which ""San Andreas"" made and did so in half the time in theaters. (As of The 4th.) Best scene: the asshole character gets eaten. AND we just KNOW there is going to be a sequel because the bad-guy scientist escapes with the GMO Überdino genes. (It's a combination of tyrannosaur and velociraptor with greater-than-human intelligence, the ability to change colors for disguise, and suppress its infrared signature so it cannot be tracked with heat sensors, and it somehow knows that the thing implanted in its back is a tracking device.) So you had better go see ""Jurassic World"" so you know how things stand when the sequel comes around.They still don't get the dinos right. Their velociraptors are about the size of achillobators and none of them have feathers in the movie. ( I have to admit that I do not like dinosaurs with feathers even tho recent finds suggest that many later dinosaurs had feathers. I WANT SCALES, not feathers, and ""Jurassic World"" delivers! )Regardless of the overly large size of the movie velociraptors, our hero in the movie becomes an alpha velociraptor and uses his position in the pack to take them hunting for the Überdino. The Überdino had gotten out of his cage by scratching the wall as if he climbed it, shutting off his thermal signature and changing his color to blend in with the plants. Then he waits for people to foolishly enter the cage, eats a couple of them, then crashes the gate which, of course, does not close in time. The Überdino then goes on a killing spree because he was raised alone (or was it a she?) and has no dinosaur manners or social skills. (I kid you not. That is the reason given in the movie.) Überdino is therefore the tallest, heaviest, toothiest psychopath ever created by Hollywood ! The hero in ""Jurassic World"" of course has a failed relationship with the female boss of the Jurassic World theme park. (Very failed; they went on ONE date. It boggles the mind why one of them is not in jail.) She in turn has invited her two nephews to the park where she is too busy to spend time with them. The little cretins therefore go off on their own at just about the time Überdino has started slashing sauropods. These kids think it's OK to go through a huge gate which has been ripped to shreds. (These kids are so dumb that Überdino would have done our gene pool a favor had he managed to eat them.) So we go through all kinds of chase and escape scenes and hunt-the-Überdino scenes. Überdino manages to escape the helicopter shooting at him with a M134 Minigun (100 bullets per second) by knocking a hole in the ""bird cage"". The pterodactyls escaping from it obligingly attack and bring down the helicopter which in turn falls through the roof of the ""bird cage"" releasing all of the pterodactyls which in their turn swoop down on 20,000 fleeing theme park patrons causing general mayhem. All very satisfying for Hollywood escapism.Of course in the end our hero saves the boss lady and her brain-dead nephews. Curiously it is the younger of the latter who states that the way to solve the problem is to have ""more teeth"", so boss lady orders the release of T-rex and she leads it to Überdino running with a flare as if dinosaurs are attracted to heat. She somehow outruns T-rex in her bare feet and tosses the flare at Überdino thus marking it as the proper target for T-rex. But T-rex has a hard time with Überdino even tho a friendly velociraptor pitches in to help.I won't tell you the mildly surprising T-rex + velociraptor vs. Überdino result in case you want to go see the movie. This movie is a serious candidate for the ""Honest Trailers"" website too! I'd have rated this movie higher if the plot holes were not big enough to sink the Titanic in. It was fun anyway.",Jurassic World
907,migz0621,A beautiful nostalgic film that kept me in the edge of my seat,10,10 June 2015,"At first I was afraid that it might suck since JP3 did, they even killed the T Rex in that one too. But I believe Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly might make it work given that they had written a critically acclaimed movie ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", and I thought, maybe they can... AND THEY DID! It brought a tear to my eye as some scenes reminded me of the first, oh the NOSTALGIA! There were a lot of nods to the original, most notably two kids getting lost and facing the evil Dino, some scenes copied the first but suddenly went in a different direction before you could say, ""They copied it from the first film!""And OH MY GOD JOSH GAD(Frozen's Olaf) WAS RIGHT! THE LAST 20 MINS OF THE FILM WAS PURE BLISS! IT WAS AMAZING! It had me at the edge of my seat.Although I may have to agree that the plot was too predictable but it was amazing, a great improvement over the third and an epic revival to the franchise!",Jurassic World
908,food-movies-sleep,Is it a reboot or a sequel?,5,14 June 2015,"The whole movie seemed like a scene by scene reboot of Jurassic Park. 2 kids, 2 adults, a park with attractions and jeep rides among dinos, a big dino escaping, kids stuck in a vehicle which the big dino pushes around, people's arms being chewed off, all four humans trapped between dinos in a room at the climax and then the climactic dino on dino fight to death! And to think that Jurassic park released 20 years ago and even after 20 years of animation development, this movie pales in comparison to the original. The only couple of good scenes are the raptor training scenes with Chris Pratt (and these are covered in the trailers) and the final multi dinosaur fight! That one scene was a money-shot. I thought Irfan Khan's character(Masrani) should have been given more dept because he was philosophical and later had a moment of conflict between what was philosophical and what was practical. And if the big-bad-dino(Indominous Rex? Really???) could communicate with one set of Dinos who shares some Dna why couldn't it do the same with the other dino in the climax? Too much inconsistency. And seems like all the free roaming dinos have been captured and there is sight of the teeny-tiny chicken like dinos who wrecked havoc in The Lost World. And the Cris Pratt-Velociraptor bonding seemed totally fake and too rushed. Was in fact ""laughable""!! If you were to watch the movie, my advice would be to skip to the very end fight scene. Or instead just watch Spielberg's original.",Jurassic World
909,itsjustmyopinion,Irony at its best,4,21 June 2015,"There they were. In a hanger full of injured. The two main stars rush to the aid of the emergency services asking how they could help. No time for makeup or future planning, their one thought was to act selflessly.And that's not what happened. This film is wonderfully ironic. The people who put commerce before caring and attention to detail are villains. The film makers would never cut corners and had objectives beyond profit making surely. It's a children's film so it has themes adults believe children relate to; recycling is good so the script is recycled (from most films but particularly from Jurassic genre films), the photographic techniques are borrowed (from titanic), the music is recycled, the ending is recycled, the moralising is recycled.The character stereotypes are predictable; ignored computer geek, hapless women, kids who would rather listen to music than help fight, commerce led baddie, reckless and poorly organised guys with guns, main characters who have film editors and script writers to gift them extreme luck and immunity from everything except bad acting.The hypocrisy follows the industries norm. As is expected, people are shaken, eaten and trampled on but its OK as collateral damage is expected in the fight against, well, anything. Dinosaurs are misunderstood and nurtured but if they misbehave, shot. And there's no doubt a gun shop in the foyer as, the NRA preach, having the means to shoot someone is a constitutional right greater than the sanctity of life.There are the usual attempts at casting diversity for the lesser roles but they play second fiddle to everything, particularly the CGI. The film is admirable as a bunch of images and is watchable but contains nothing memorable. It is another wasted opportunity to make something really worthwhile rather than a scheme to make lots of money. Perhaps that's the real message.",Jurassic World
910,oceanofblue,Return to the park.,8,17 June 2015,"Let me explain my rating of 8. I'm not giving any points to the story as it obviously follows the basic rules and doesn't bend in any unexpected way. Before I went into the theater I made a prediction of how the movie would go: the park is open and everyone's happy, suddenly a dinosaur or dinosaurs goes on the rampage in a killing frenzy, some visitors are in a forbidden zone when the park goes in shutdown, few people get killed, probably some ""ingen-villains"" have some mischief up their sleeves but in the end everyone escapes and live happily ever after. In a way I wasn't so far off the plot.I can not rate the story as you've probably noticed by now it's kind of predictable. And the dialogs weren't so surprising either as you could've easily muted the actors and still you know what was going on.So, why my 8? Basically because the effects were indeed well done and the attention for detail is superb. There are times however the movie takes a run with itself and you don't know it is intended or not. Eg: the dinosaur petting zoo where children can ride a baby- triceratops or hug a baby Diplodocus. I was sure in the next scene Fred and Wilma Flintstone would show up chasing Dino. Still a nice gimmick though. But overall the dinosaurs were well crafted, attention for detail and by times you would actually believe that those were real live animals.Another reason why I'm giving an 8 is because, despite of the gimmicks, they remain true to the original and you will notice a lot of original elements from the first movie. Nostalgia at it's best. You could easily pick out a lot of things that were in the original Jurassic park. Even Dr. Wu is back. And they put in the slightest detail basically everywhere. Who can forget the Tyrannosaur in the first Jurassic park howling in the main building after defeating the raptors. They recreated the scene on the very same spot in the very same pose.I only have 2 problems with this movie. However there were enough dinosaurs and I believe even more than the first movie, I have the feeling like I haven't seen enough dinosaurs. For some reason, the movie seems to have less of them than his ancestors. And second: Not enough dinosaur-action, by which I mean dinosaur on dinosaur. No battles or at least exciting ones. It's almost like: let's make a movie about dinosaurs, but in a way forget to let them play the main role. This time I felt like all attention was on Zach and Gray and Claire and Owen.In overall, a very well done homage to the original movie, well done CGI (some times to noticeable) and exciting enough to make it worth seeing it.",Jurassic World
911,SlickWellington,"Maybe not a triumph, but it does feature a Triumph",8,5 September 2015,"Man, people are really tearing this movie apart. Yeah, it's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but it was a heck of a lot of fun. Seeing the amazing new park in action was brilliant -- for me, it brought back the thrill from 1993 or whatever when I first looked up at the big screen and watched that sweeping shot of brontosauruses and other dinosaurs grazing leaves and wading in the river -- back when good CGI still packed that ""wow"" factor. Sadly, we hardly get to see all of the new park's amazing features and the attractions it offers (aside from the nifty gyro-ball-vehicles) before it all goes haywire. I know audiences want to get to the action, but it was all so stunning, another five minutes wouldn't have killed anyone ... literally.I thought the creation of the new species of dinosaur seemed logical from a capitalism standpoint, and were it handled differently it could have been a profound statement on the dangers of exploratory genetic engineering and efforts to create ""designer pets"" by tinkering with nature. The whole scenario took me back to something Ian Malcolm said in Crichton's original novel about Hammond not producing ""real"" dinosaurs but facsimiles of dinosaurs -- illusions of dinosaurs or something to that effect. Too bad Malcolm wasn't in this movie to deliver that dialogue, but it would have felt heavy-handed to bring him or any of the other characters from previous films back ... although a William H. Macy-getting-eaten cameo would have made me laugh out loud.Some people didn't like the appearance of gear from the original film in Jurassic World, but to me it served to show the passage of time and in a way filled in the blanks about what had happened. It was a nice bit of showing and not telling.I thought the female lead was rather poorly done, at least the way she failed to keep track of her sister's children. She had good chemistry with Pratt though, but yeah ... she should have been raptor chow.And speaking of Chris Pratt ... by the end of the movie my girlfriend wanted to make out with him, and I would have let him and then stood in line to give him a high-five, ha! What a bad ass! This ain't your daddy's Robert Muldoon who didn't even have his weapon ready while hunting raptors, this was a guy who stood toe-to-toe with them and bossed them around with hand signals -- sort of like a dinosaur Peyton Manning. Bonus points for Pratt delivering arguably the best line in a film for the past five years: ""Who's the alpha?"" ""I am."" I actually said ""YES!"" when I heard that ... it's a little cheesy, but come on! It's supposed to be fun. A good monster movie needs a hero that can hold his own, and Pratt's character brought together a little Alan Grant with his bond with and compassion for the animals and a little Muldoon with his ability to kick some butt at a moment's notice.Finally, my dad has a 1963 Triumph Scrambler out in the barn at home ... so seeing that Triumph tear through the jungle leading a pack of raptors after the mutant-o-saurus ... whoa, that was awesome! Realistically, Pratt should have gone over the handlebars sometime in the first 20 seconds of that chase and also been Raptor Chow, but it was an awesome image and a bit of escapism.I gave it high marks because honestly, this is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long, long time. I'm sort of ignoring its minor flaws because as a whole it really delivers on what a good summer popcorn movie should be.",Jurassic World
912,air-terjun-chibi,Bad Box Reviews: Jurassic World,7,14 June 2015,"First, sorry for my weird English. *SPOILER ALEEERT!!!*If you come to the theater hoping an intelligent, visual effect revolving thriller like the first Jurassic Park you'll be disappointed. However, if you hoping a good popcorn entertainment with great effects and action sequences, well you'll be satisfied. The film sets 22 years after the first film. Now, Isla Nubar is a functional dinosaurs theme park which is obviously bigger and more amusing than Jurassic Park with real life dinosaurs (geez, haven't those people learned anything from the first, second and that retarded third film?). However, to attract more visitors (and cash), the park developers decide to make a new dinosaur named Indominus Rex, a T-Rex Hybrid. However, one day, Indominus Rex manages to escape (mostly because its laughable cage design) and terrorize the park, bringing the site into a total chaos. And, our hero here (played by that guy from Guardians of Galaxy) has to save the day by stopping the hybrid while taking care of his ex gf and her nephews and keeping an eye on people from Ingen (that company still exist??) with different agenda. Without further ado, let's see the good and the bad from this film. The Good: 1. The dinos are the coolest among the series, especially that hybrid and the aquatic babe (I forget the name). 2. The visual effects are really well made. The Jurassic World are also beautifully designed. And it was really cool to see it on 3D. 3. The action sequences are brilliantly crafted. The director really did a good job here! I could feel thrilled whenever the dinos were on the screen, killing dumb humans or fellow dinos. 4. The acting from the main casts is pretty great, especially Chris Pratt. 5. There're actually some smart writings there. Many dialogs are genuinely funny and make the film looks fresh. 6. It's really entertaining to watch, really!The Bad: 1. Unintelligent plot. Really, most of the events on this film can occur because the park's Holy B%$@hslap security system. If I were the owner of the park, I would fire the park's security designer on the first day! 2. There are many 'failed' dramatic scenes that look a little bit ridiculous. 3. The hero and the raptors' relationship is a little bit silly. 4. The climax battle is very-very silly. -. The humans are saved by the raptors (who get pwned really fast by that hybrid) -. One human lures a T-Rex to the battle site (amazingly, she has a same speed with that Dino. It's either T-Rex sucks at marathon or the woman is actually an Usain Bolt in disguise.) -. The T-Rex decides to save the human by fighting the hybrid instead of... you know, eating them! -. When the T-Rex is about to lose, raptor EX-Machina. -. Aquatic Babe EX-Machina. -. The End! 5. Furthermore, it's really predictable. However, I still recommend this film to anyone because it's really worth your time and money if you're looking for pure entertainment. I actually had a really great time watching this, and that's good. Because the main purpose of a film is to entertain the audiences right? And this film undeniably succeeded in doing so. One more note: Don't compare this to the first film please! It's not even close! (Well, who wants to compete with Mr. Spielberg anyway?)Final score: 80",Jurassic World
913,cypressoury,Favotire Film of 2015,10,11 June 2015,"This post contains no spoilers. I'll post a more in-depth (spoilerific) review later:Overall, I love the heck out of the film. I felt that the dialogue, characters, dinos, and plot were all really cool and amazing. I had fun watching the film. I felt that it lead into a possible sequel very well and very unintentionally. The designs of everything in the film were top notch. I haven't seen a better film than this in a long while (definitely since before 2015). I think Colin did right in having the film delayed. The story was better than it could've been if it had been lie that Jonlo leak from last year. I was so amazed that I was stuck in my chair until the end of the end credits. If you get the chance, go see it in 3D/ This film really made my day. I can't wait for Jurassic World II. 10/10 rating.",Jurassic World
914,TheSpartanGr,Jurassic World is pure action!,8,20 June 2015,"With all the hype I expected a superb movie, even better than the classic ""Jurassic Park"". This movie wasn't better than the original, but it wasn't awful either...What I liked: I liked that we saw Jurassic Park (here renamed Jurassic World) being open to the people. I loved Chris Pratt's acting in this movie, he was a bad-ass and also funny without being stupid. I loved all the action scenes, not all of them were original (they reminded me of the previous movies) but I liked them! I like that we saw Dr. Henry Wu, someone that brought a ""Jurassic Park"" aura, its good seeing familiar faces! I loved we saw the old visitor centre from JP1 and also the Wrangler jeep those kids used, is supposed to be the same one that John Hammond used to drive Dr. Grant and Dr. Satler to see the Brachiosaur. I found it amazing those kids found the famous banner ""When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth"" that fell in the finale of the first movie while T-Rex roared! Also I liked the scene where Bryce Dallas Howard opens the door for T-Rex and leads her towards indominus Rex. I liked the battle between Indominus Rex, T-Rex and MosasaurWhat I did not like: in the first three JP movies (yes even the third one) the whole theme is about the morality of using extinct animals for money. in Jurassic World they tried hard to show us a bit of morality issued but they did not get it, they managed to make me feel sorry for the Brachiosaur (or Brontosaur) that was killed from Indominus Rex, but thats just it. Also their next try to show us morality was when Vincent D'Onofrio wanted to take those raptors to war, and Chris Pratt objects! I did not liked that Dr. Henry Wu suddenly became a mad scientist who wants to make money out of the embryos. I found Mr Masrani's character trying to imitate Hammonds optimistic rich-guy look and style, but to me he seemed just arrogant. I did not liked that the famous killer,intelligent,vicious velociraptors are somehow used as pets here, I don't care if there is a reasonable explanation, for me that was bad. You cannot spend three previous JP movies, teaching us that Velociraptors are untamed animals that will kill you, and then using them as pussycats. I find perfectly reasonable Mr. Trevorrow's explanation of why they didn't brought original cast members back, but I still would like to see someone. Also Indominus Rex might be a hybrid but that doesn't explain her irrational behaviour, she kills for sport? really? that was stupid! No animal, hybrid or not would kill for sport, only humans do that! Also why did Indominus Rex waited to escaped first so it would remove the tracking device, that was extremely human of her! I mean its another thing to be intelligent and another to be human-like! Pteranosaurs escaped, and instead of going everywhere, they deliberately go straight to the park where all people are. Pteranosaurs were fish eating animals, so chasing humans was so not rational...it seemed like someone ordered them to attack people! Also I did not liked at all that Steven Spielberg decided to be part of this but he did not do the directing! Not to insult Mr. Trevorrow but man if you are gonna be part of this movie, then direct it as you did with the original, don't just be a producer! The movie is full of action, if you don't care about some flaws in dinosaurs behaviour then you will love it, I gave it 8/10 because it wasn't that bad, I liked it, and it was way better than the JP3! *Friendly request to Universal: Please DO NOT make a sequel, we have seen everything in JP and JW movies, a sequel would be a disaster.",Jurassic World
915,lumpacidshadow,A Fun Movie That Gets Worse the More you Think About it,5,18 June 2015,"Jurassic World has pretty much everything a summer blockbuster should have to merit watching it purely for the enjoyment of the movie-going experience. The effects are great, there are some tense action scenes, and the movie manages to recapture some of that JP magic, if only for a few brief moments. It's unfortunate, then, that Jurassic World has so many problems, most notably with its script.The primary incident, for instance, is entirely borne of our idiotic cast, who time and time again fumble and end up squarely in the jaws of the dinosaurs. Any logical approach to the crisis is ignored or magically deflected, and plot threads vanish mysteriously, never to return.The movie will have you asking questions like: Why did Claire decide to send people into the dino pen when they didn't know where the dino was, and they had a tracking beacon? Why would you send a team of people after a 50ft long dinosaur with little more than cattle prods? Why did Owen and Claire decide to spend five minutes easing a dinosaur to its death when the two kids they're supposed to be looking for are in certain peril? Why didn't the helicopter's minigun have any effect on the escaped dinosaur after it was riddled with bullets? Why, when the strike team had it cornered with the raptors near the end, did nobody decide ""yeah now's the time to fire all of our rockets""? Why does Owen use such an impractical weapon that he spends more time reloading in the one scene where it gets significant use? Where did the pterodactyls that were released from the glass dome go after wreaking havoc on everything? How did Claire outrun a T-Rex in heels? Where did the Asian head scientist go after hell broke loose in the labs? All these questions and more you'll be asking yourself, and it makes it hard to see the movie in a good light. It's definitely a movie to watch in 3D, on the largest possible screen, but unfortunately not one to think too hard on, lest you become frustrated.",Jurassic World
916,majnus-493-843216,Absolute garbage,2,13 July 2015,"When I first saw the trailer I was hyped. I knew this is the movie I am definitely going to see, Because I LOVED the original one 18 years ago. So I did go ahead and watch it. And I regret it. The movie has nothing original in it. Nothing. It's almost exact same screenplay. I mean it. 2x kids visiting the jurassic park - CHECK Intelligent and dangerous dinosaur escapes his cage - CHECK While he escapes his cage, the 2x kids are in the vehicle somewhere in the park - CHECK Dinosaur catches up with nobody else but them - CHECK Destroys their vehicle and they manage to escape and run away - CHECK A badass man and a woman are going after them to save them - CHECK Badass couple found the destroyed vehicle, thought the kids are dead, but then found the footprints on the mud and learned the kids survived - CHECK One bad guy trying to make money on a bad situation - CHECK Bad guy gets killed by a dinosaur - CHECK Main characters get surrounded by raptors, and then t-rex comes along, and they fight - CHECKLast scene - t-rex in the park roaring at everything that's destroyed - CHECKThe clichés, the EXACT same things from the original JP, the very, very poor acting by the kids, just a tip of the iceberg. Original Jurassic Park from 1993 was unbelievably amazing, original, great actors, superb dinosaur CGIs. Jurassic World is a poor copy that's disappointing in every way and predictable. Would not recommend. Just do yourself a favour and skip this one.",Jurassic World
917,sgordon2011,I Hate This Movie,2,27 December 2020,"Firstly, let's establish that the entire reason this movie currently exists is for Spielberg to continue making gobs of money.Secondly, let's also establish that the director is waaay out of his depth on this one. Having helmed ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (which is a solid little indie romcom that I enjoy) it's clear that promoting him so drastically in budget, scale, and material is not something that should have been green lit. But here we are.This movie relies almost entirely on the nostalgic goodwill of the audience. I'm sure many of the adults watching grew up adoring Jurassic Park and are eager to share that thrill and enjoyment with their own kids with the new franchise. However, so much of the heart and soul of Jurassic Park lies in Spielberg's deft balance of action sequences and emotion. Jurassic World has absolutely none of that as it handles each new sequence with a ham fist. There are glimmers, of course, like the slaughtering of the brachiosaurus at the hands of the new mutant dinosaur, but just as quickly as it appears, it's gone again.I will admit, I was taken in at moments, my mind drifting into excitement at the discovery of the original park, the revving of those original Jeep engines, the concept of having a raptor as a really intense, really cool dog... I found these moments enjoyable, but none of it has anything to do with the reason the original story took place in the first place-that man should not play God. Clearly no one listened because Spielberg and Co continue to beat a dead horse because ""dinosaurs are cool"" and apparently that's all anyone expects from this franchise.The original is first and foremost science fiction, with the happy opportunity of being directed by the godfather of the summer blockbuster; It falls into the pleasant position of being excellent at both. However, Jurassic World is just a Frankenstein's Monster dressed in a vintage Jurassic Park t-shirt asking you to love it as it's slowly strangling you to death.",Jurassic World
918,mohak79,A Sci-Fi and action packed movie that features dinosaurs : AWESOME,6,18 June 2015,"It has been almost 14 years since the last Jurassic park movie, this movie was expected to be much greater. Now the question is was it that good?When all the previous Jurassic Park movies had almost the same theme and story line this movie gave the theme a new touch. Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (screenplay writers) succeed in intelligently surprising the audience at many scenes.I am here giving you a briefing about the plot (for the viewers who have not watched the previous movies): 22 years after failure of the first dinosaur theme park by John Hammond now the park was rebuild and is well functioning until a new attraction gets out of control and becomes a threat.Apart from the story the roles portrayed by all the cast members was appreciable. But this movie was mostly about the 3-D effects and the more than awesome animation. The story also was well connected and makes the viewer involved for the whole 124 minutes.The only disappointment that I had was it didn't create a lot of thrill that was being expected from the movie or the thrill that could be experienced in the previous movies.So if you are expecting it to be scary and lot thrilling please lower your hopes because this is action packed adventurous film that features dinosaurs.I would say this is a really enjoyable movie with a lot of surprises. Go and watch it.",Jurassic World
919,ddoyle2017,What I Expected,6,14 June 2015,"""Jurassic World"" was a very good movie. I liked the new and improved park (Now that it's finally open). The action scenes were really cool. When the hybrid dinosaur was fighting the T-Rex, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. It's amazing how far that technology has come since the first installment in the franchise. One of the things I didn't like was how unrealistic it was. I know you guys are probably wondering, ""It's a movie about dinosaurs on an island with a theme park on it."" I understand that it's a far fetched plot, but what I liked about the first, second, and third ""Jurassic Park."" At least in those movies the dinosaurs were just chasing the humans because they wanted a nice snack. In this new movie, velociraptors are jumping onto T-Rexs to take down a hybrid dinosaur. That kind of thing wouldn't happen if dinosaurs were still living. Also, what are the odds that the water dinosaur thing would be waiting at the edge of the pool at just the right moment to kill the GMO. Did any of you guys think it was weird that Owen could control the raptors. In all of the other films, they made the raptors out to be vicious beasts, but now, they are house pets that can be told commands. This could've been a better movie if the plot was a little better. I was disappointed by the character build up. They just put 2 kids on a plane and suddenly they were the main characters, and all they tell us about Owen is that he was an ex-marine that happened to date the aunt of the two kids that happen to be in trouble. What are the odds? I loved the design of the park itself. It looks like a dinosaur Disney world in a way, just on an island. I wish so bad that this park was real. Finally, I liked the throw backs to the old movies. First of all, there was the DNA cartoon character. They also showed the dinosaur in the first movie that looked like he had a mane. The old jeep was really cool as well. That was a major throwback. I gave this movie a 6 because I liked the action, but I thought that the character build up was bad and it didn't have a good storyline. I still hope they make a 5th one.",Jurassic World
920,joelbrown137,Pointless and Predictable,4,24 January 2016,"Where do I begin with this film? Well I found this film very boring and very pointless. This is a film that is bad with some good aspects, the good aspects include the directing is okay and the audience sees okay character development that shows us that these characters can be related to and understood. The other good aspect about this film would be that it doesn't use shaky cam. However this film has a lot of problems and the first of which in my opinion is the special effects, they are not very special the CGI used has made the dinosaurs look fake, they looked better in the original film. The second thing I didn't like is that this film is not well paced the script is not written that well because the action does not take place until the second hour of this film. The other thing that annoys me is that some of the characters on screen do stupid things and nothing ever happens to them. Overall this is film does not live up to the original at all, I think that some people will like this very much but I didn't because this film was just a cash grab and was pointless and very predictable which made it less entertaining.",Jurassic World
921,grayremnant1,"Smart Dinosaur, Dumb Writers",6,12 June 2015,"Overall, this wasn't a dull film. It was full of action and very absorbing. It just wasn't a very intelligent film. The writers took shortcuts to move the plot in the direction they wanted, and most of the characters fluctuate from utter moron to complete genius throughout the film.The acting was relatively dull, with the exception of Chris Pratt who played a character he's played over and over again. Most everyone else was uttering cringe-worthy dialogue throughout the film.The story is cliché, uninteresting, and full of moronic plot holes. The idea to turn the raptors into tamable teddy-bear creatures was a terrible decision that turned potentially horrific moments into a waste of time. Couple that with a worse deus ex machina moment than the first film, and you have a veritable mess on your hands.The most damning part of this film was the fact that the writers spent 14 years developing a story with a dinosaur written to be smarter than the writers themselves. Indominus possesses all the wit and clever thinking that could have been used to write a terrific screenplay. Next time, write a smarter story with a dumber dinosaur.",Jurassic World
922,alesci-andrea-m,The (weak) awakening of dinosaurs,5,5 August 2015,"We can really feel the astonishment on Gray's face (Ty Simpkins) in front of the Jurassic World and it looks like an emotional flip back in time to 1993 while resounds John Williams's theme (embodied in Michael Giacchino's new soundtrack). That's atmosphere relives and it seems to us to have never left Isla Nublar.The sign Steven Spielberg impressed on Jurassic Park twenty-two years ago lingers indelibly on who saw it and it comes back in this 4th chapter of the saga (after The Lost World and Jurassic Park III) under a new guise: A work by the debuting director Colin Trevorrow, who is clever in using that Spielbergian echoes as a mouthpiece. Above all the ear leads us in this known-tasting journey inside a brand new fun-machine that orbits around dinosaurs. Voiced sensations (music, rustles, calls) and a good use of the 3D enthrall us, so we can discover a park in which kids can ride little herbivorous dinosaurs, holograms bewitch skeptic too and fences of great predators drag us jauntily in the Jurassic Era.It is exactly inside the Velociraptors' cage we get familiar with the instructor Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) after we have seen the most terrible attraction: the Indominus Rex, a genetic hybrid created by InGen once ruled by John Hammond and now by Simon Marfani (Irrfan Khan), owner of a dreamy park whose direction he have committed to the beautiful Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard).As it happened in 1993 with Jurassic Park, it's always the most dreadful creature to remember us how much we are tiny compared to the sublime Nature: at the time it was the T-Rex to create the fracture between dream and tragic events, now it's the genetic patchwork Indominus Rex to spread violence and blood. And its astute escape begins to show us all the cracks of a movie able to bring a twinkle to our eyes but actually to shrivel up like men and things under dinosaurs' brutality (too much flaunted indeed).So the experiment Jurassic World is crushed by the mammoth weight of a creature out of control and it hesitates on building a plot which pieces are often disconnected each other and whose characters are flat and easily forgettable. So we find ourselves wandering within a story that has two young brothers as protagonists on the run from the Indominus, while their aunt Claire and the muscular Owen try to save them implementing the (ruinous) plan of warlike Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) that concerns pounce on the Indominus the Raptors as an operational military test.In the meantime the whole island has fallen in the chaos: Thousands of tourists become preys to pterodactyls escaped from their aviary and only Trevorrow's cliffhangers that quote Spielberg can pick up us out of the hustle: The shark the gigantic Masosaurus devours as per the 1975 cult movie Jaws; Gray and Zach that repair the same Jeep Wrangler John Hammond drove in Jurassic Park; The pursuit of the Raptors like that one of the T-Rex in The Lost World; at the end the T-Rex that comes to save all from the Indominus (in 1993 the Raptors did it). Homages and quotes that aid us spreading out like sails boat over Isla Nublar and conclude the dream of an impossible return in the same way everything began: With the proud roar of the T-Rex.",Jurassic World
923,brandoncarlk,A hybrid of numerous intentions,7,8 August 2015,"This is one of the most divisive movies that I've seen in a while. It's one of those ""Love it or hate it"" where everybody has such intense feelings for it. I think that's because there are two main ideas of what a Jurassic Park movie should be. Is it a cerebral franchise that illustrates the hubris of humanity's attempts to control nature or is it just a fun monster movie romp with thrills and chills? I guess that's up to the audience so I won't tell you how you should judge the movie on those standards. I'm just going to judge it from your basic movie going perspective.Let me just say that all the dinosaur fights were fun, I almost always laughed at the comic relief, the story was easy to follow with generally believable character motives, and it moved at a nice pace. Some of the acting was pretty good. Chris Pratt was a fun character, and probably the best thing going for this movie. I do have complaints though: Vincent D'Onofrio's character was entirely one-dimensional, the CGI just isn't always convincing, and there are a lot of moments throughout the film that just strain your credulity. I realize it's a movie with dinosaurs come to life but it was a bit much at times. It even has a number of monster movie clichés that make the movie a bit predictable.I enjoyed my time with the movie, but it wasn't always as tense as it could have been. I guess if you judge it as a monster movie, it's fine. In all honesty, the plot felt like a Syfy original monster movie, only with a sizable budget and bankable actors - that's not entirely as bad as that sounds. If you're looking for something intellectually stimulating that forces you to think about the human condition, you might have a little meat, but you're going to be left hungry. Your enjoyment boils down to what you expect from the franchise.",Jurassic World
924,mikesmithspeed,"Awesome Again ""Jurassic World""",8,30 June 2015,"Let me start by saying that I love dinosaurs. I want to say about ""Jurassic World"" its very good cinematography. As far as the plot goes, I found several elements of the movie extremely over the top. Especially the over the Dinosaur wrestling brawls.I was never bored. The movie was good, very good, and it has some mesmerizing very well-made sequences, the best & amazing action, although the Jurassic franchise has been considered to a certain degree a family movie.I found Jurassic World a bit on the gorier level, its not for little kids. I found that very exaggerated the character was also one that didn't make it in the film. But to watch a character that wasn't really antagonistic get brutally murdered, I felt it was pointless. The all characters were played very well and the performances gave the audience interesting characters, some that you hope are not eaten by the dinosaurs, some not.

925,zarapaola,Worse than Sharknado,1,28 June 2015,"After the excellent third installment of Jurassic Park back in 2001, it took many years for a fourth installment of the franchise to finally be produced. But who could imagine that it would be in the form of a nonsensical, predictable and poorly structured TV movie for the big screen worth of the worst Syfy spoofs. Yes, you see dinosaurs. Yes, the special effects are good. But the acting is so bad (a completely expressionless Bryce Dallas Howard walks though the events in an immaculate white dress and in high heels) and the story so utterly absurd and obvious (a genetically modified and seemingly very smart breed of tyrannosaur to accommodate the corporate requirements to keep up attendance at a theme park) that halfway through it one begins to wonder if it is actually all made on purpose. Perhaps I got it completely wrong, and this WAS meant to be a cinematic equivalent to Sharknado (which I enjoyed much more, by the way). Some moments are absolutely unforgettable (such as when, after re-emerging from swimming in a river, one of the two brothers starts a fire using the matches he had in his pocket and drive a jeep abandoned for more than twenty years) and they would probably make sense in a John Landis movie, but from a Steven Spielberg franchise one would expect more than just (already seen) special effects to justify bringing back such a powerful franchise. I wish I could give this less than one star.",Jurassic World
926,drewthedude,A Mostly excellent revival to the Jurassic series,8,3 July 2015,"I really liked the original Jurassic Park movie, but I was never crazy about it like some people were. I can understand why it blew so many minds back in the day since it was one of the first movies to feature photo-realistic CGI. But since I didn't see that film until a bit later in my childhood and after already seeing a bunch of other films with modern CGI, I never got that since of awe so many other people got when they saw that film back in the early 90's. After Jurassic Park came two sequels which were both given a lot more mixed reception when compared to the original. Now comes a fourth film, Jurassic World, which aims to reboot the series but still acknowledge the first three film's existence. Was Jurassic World a worthy revival to series, or does it also have that ""been there, done that"" feeling that the second and third film had? Here's my thoughts on the new film.First off, I'm happy to say that this film does do a great job of giving us impressive dinosaur action, especially in the second half of this film. As you've seen from the trailers, There is this new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex and it is definitely a fierce dinosaur that you wouldn't want to mess around with. This dinosaur is strong, smart and even a bit scary at times, I was impressed. Even though this film is trying to keep its distance from the original JP, there is also plenty of nods to the original sprinkled throughout the film so keep your eyes pealed when you go see this film. As for the human characters, I really liked Chris Pratt's character, Owen Grady. He may have had a few cheesy one-liners but I still thought he had a good role in the film. I liked that he had his own ""army"" of Raptors by his side. Also, I got to commend Michael Giacchino for his score in the film. It was great to not only hear the iconic Jurassic Park theme make a return, but there was also a new short theme he composed that I'll admit sent some chills down my spine because it was that epic.Now this film still has a few problems, however. For while I did like Chris Pratt's character I found most of the other characters to be not so great. Like the two kids in this film are really not that interesting, the filmmakers try to add some family issue elements to the film and they were not at all necessary! There was also Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, who was luckily more interesting in the second half of this film, but was a bit underwhelming during the first half. Overall, the first act is not quite as entertaining as the second half.Overall, Jurassic World is an entertaining film with good dinosaur action but a bit of an underwhelming beginning to it. If you like dinosaur action and Chris Pratt, then you will probably enjoy this film. It still doesn't quite capture that amazing feeling the original had, but it's definitely better than JP2 and JP3. Just be warned that this film may not be for every Jurassic Park fan out there.",Jurassic World

My personal favorite of the trilogy is Jurassic Park 2. When i started watching Jurassic World i never thought that there would be annoying kid characters and silly looking mix-breed dinosaurs. Instead of focusing on real species they decided to make something original , intelligent enough to outsmart humans , but IMO the creature needed a bunch of laser beams and a machine gun. The plot was very predictable, they focused on very few dinosaurs too , i felt like i was waiting many years for nothing.

929,ryanbates-39030,Jurassic World 2015,6,31 January 2016,"As a die hard fan of Jurassic Park I have to be honest and say I was disappointed with this movie. Although this movie depicts dinosaurs and a futuristic theme park/zoo which will make great viewing for kids, as an adult i cannot feel anything except sadness. As in all of the Jurassic Park franchise's there is often moments of unrealistic events but this one just takes the biscuit. The park is just too futuristic, the Indominus rex is just far too intelligent and the dramatic events are just too far fetched. None of the dramatic scenes were ever intense or fearful as the origionals were therefore making me believe that this movie is aimed at younger audiences on the hope of meeting the marketing demands. Personally my biggest disappointment was the fact that the mighty T-rex would have probably lost the battle with the Indominus rex as it was clearly suffering a beating and had to be bailed out by the Mosasaurus maximus. For me the T-rex symbolizes the Jurassic Park franchise and after seeing one killed by the Spinosaurus in Jurassic Park 3 i was extremely disappointed with the T-rex's attempt at a mighty comeback in this movie which in my opinion was poor writing. I also believe that the training and possible domestication of the Velociraptor is utter craziness. It takes hundreds of years to tame and domesticate animals even the domestic cat and dog so it is too unrealistic that a guy manages to train and tame the earhts most intelligent and deadliest, non human predator ever to grace its lands. Frankly I was disappointed and have never felt like watching it again.",Jurassic World

Come on. The whole movie is full of logical mistakes and I am not talking about the dinosaurs, I am talking about the plot itself. The big problem that is possible to see in almost all Hollywood movies in the last 10 years. That is why I prefer European Art Cinema. I mean, I normally can take it when the mistakes are small, but in this one, oh boy no way. I can not stand it. I just can not. Two main problems, Idiotic plot and unnecessary details. I would say the only good thing about this movie is Mr. Pratt's acting. But again, the way characters interact, the following of the plot, it is just, so amateur, this kind of stuff happened in 90's or early 2000's. Come on it is fricking 2015. I believe CGI and some good acting and roots of this movie got it a 7.0 on IMDb. But it should not have. This is 5.0 even when you try to be very optimistic about it.",Jurassic World

Minor spoilers really ...I wasn't really hyped when I first saw the trailer, but when i went to the cinemas during summer, it was the first movie I saw. And i can tell you, IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. The first scene where you see a giant foot hitting the ground, but it was actually a camera zooming on a bird's foot was amazing ! It gave me a sense of nostalgia. Everybody laughed in the theaters. Acting was good but cheesy at some times making the movie not as dark as previous titles. Excellent cinematography and CGI. The soundtrack was awesome as well. The movie got me on the edge of my seat FOR 2 HOURS, didn't get bored at all. And like I said, i remember every bit. And the movie had an epic conclusion to top it off. People trust me ...

They always try to go bigger and better, first they added a 2nd T-Rex in Part 2, then I think they added a fin to its back in Part 3(?), Now we got this version... what's next?

933,leomingo,A low-intelligent movie with absolutely no sense,3,23 February 2017,"Bad actings, bad scripts, no real-life sense, this movie just tells the audience what the word fictional means, that is, totally fake with absolutely no intelligence in it.I have never watched old Jurassic Park movies, this is the first time I watch a movie labeled Jurassic Park, and from the time on that I finished watching the movie, the name will only make me think of the word stupidity whenever I will see the name again.The plot is simply horrible. The character I have the biggest problem with is Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard). Seriously literally I have never seen any fictional character in any movie or book that is just so narcissistic, selfish, immature, stupid as a protagonist who was supposed to be on the good side, she was just so... b-itchy.So in the movie, with a genetically modified Dinosaur-lizard hybrid monster killing machine that was created by Claire as a background preset , she wouldn't listen to advice to evacuate Jurassic Park tourists when they had a chance, shouting to people telling her to call off a mission that would kill all the men involved in, being in a jungle searching for kids by shouting out loud their names and when being hushed she would shout back ""Hey you are not my boss!!"", and then after being a b-itch all along, suddenly shot a dinosaur saved the male protagonist(Chris Pratt) and the male stood up and said, ""Hey, the kids and dinosaurs and those running mates are watching, let's give it a kiss"". ""Oh how romantic"", the genius director thought himself when he was filming this scene while eating popcorn rubbing his toes gap then gave hischick a kiss. And Zach(Nick Robinson) and his little brother, were alone in a glass ball vehicle, while the broadcast was warning all tourists to head back and all entries would be closed soon, Zach said suck it I ain't head back let's head on for more fun, then accelerated, his brother was worried and begged him to go back, he said, ""Yo bro don't be shy, this is all for yr happiness, see there's a sign read 'restricted area', come on lemme drive yo in"", and then murmured, ""otherwise how ma supposed to let those adults to save myass, I can't think of a better way to let this super awesome CGI movie go on"". Both of these characters had no apologies to whom they should apologize to at all,And then here comes the bad guy who wants to make raptors be militarized weapons so he can get some money because he was sure military will have to buy them so they can save more soldiers life on battlegrounds, our good guys were so pissedoff, especially Claire -- ""You lair! I only made the monster and I only was responsible for all the dead out there and I am a bad aunt, and how dare you lied to us all and try to make money out of dinosaurs, F U"", And while our four good guys and the bad guy were arguing in a circle in a lab, suddenly a raptor rushed in and the bad guy was like ""oh, gosh, run, the good guys run to that corner I should go to the opposite"" , and then got eaten alive, bad guys always die huh. And then our heroes were running away from raptors, ""oh so close, but you can't catch me because I'm the good guy, lalalalalala~""And finally we meet our hybrid monster again, as they were near the edge of being torn by its claws, the kid thought of a genius plan, how about us releasing other dinosaurs and let them kill that moster?Claire then padded on his little niece's head, ""Good boy"", then ran to open the gate released a T-rex(hehe, genius indeed) then led it to the monster and the T-rex like a meow-meow cat following his master closely but wouldn't even scratch her cloth, and together with his friend raptor and his sea buddy mosasaur, he killed the outcast hybrid who was killed for being too intelligent because he could camouflage and kill people. After eliminating the bad guy, our hero dinosaurs looked at each other's eyes giving eye contact and brotherhood love, then walked in different ways peacefully, they just killed an animal for being too intelligent because it could camouflage, and time to take a break.At the end our T-rex hero after being released killing a hybrid monster for being too intelligent and violent, without hurting anybody any animal along the road, walked to the edge of the cliff, in the early morning sunshine, and roaring his glory out to draw the movie's end, what a splendid scene! ""It's Jurassic Park dinosaurs, suuuuckers!"" Roared the T-rex, right in front of the audience sitting behind that big fat screen.",Jurassic World
934,be_kwa,"Dull, Uninspired Sequel",5,21 July 2015,"Because of its massive box-office and overall hype, I decided to catch it on the big screen. After 20 years since the original Jurassic Park, the technology at use in Jurassic World was impressively more advanced. However the film-making technology was a major letdown. Maybe it was just me but the dinosaurs looked more realistic and lifelike in Jurassic Park. And that was 20 years ago!I looked forward to the use of the signature Jurassic Park theme song but was so disappointed at the poor usage of the theme song and the overall weak music score. The opening sequence to the actual park felt like a whimper instead of a majestic roar.All of the main characters were dull and frankly forgettable. Honestly I could not care less about any of the humans and in the end was only interested in the fate of the raptors. It's ironical that the other summer blockbuster Age of Ultron managed to humanize super-heroes and yet here the humans are de-humanized.Most disappointingly, this film had none of the artistry, attentiveness to detail and passion evident in Jurassic Park. Somehow it felt like a cash-grab effort.The only plus to me was the cool technology at Jurassic World. Give me a gyrosphere ride anytime.",Jurassic World
935,fullycyborged,They're prostituting the Jurassic Park franchise,4,9 July 2018,"Im glad i waited 3 years to watch this, i didnt miss a thing. it basically confirmed what i feared, its a monster movie with nonstop action and little to no story. oh and the dopey genetically engineered hybrid indomimus or whatever it was called killed it for me. i know this is supposed to be sc-fi/action but that was a little overly goofy, i kinda tuned out and just laughed at the goofiness of whoever approved this script. 
acting was horrendous as well. particularly the two young boys - whos names i dont even remember cause they were so forgettable, also the 'claire' character was a robot. there was a scene where the boy claimed to have failed his driving test yet he proceeds to haul ass in a manual transmission jeep. lmao. this movie is a joke in more ways than one! these actors had to be... they had to be robots? please tell me they were animatrons or cgi or something? no human being can be this bland lol. with the exception of owen, he was ok.
do these characters return for fallen kingdom? if so i will flat out never watch that movie lol. furthermore, seems like these movies regurgitate what the original jurassic park did; ill give the lost world some credit they did add a different perspective when they placed dinosaurs in our own backyards. i loved the scenes of the t-rex running in the middle of the street and roaming in peoples backyards, that was different that was cool. but these JW movies are so dopey and predictable and an obvious cash grab.this is why the original jurassic park and lost world will always be the best installments in the franchise (change my mind). they told a good story and it was at the forefront of it all, they injected action into the mix just perfect and exactly where it was needed, they didnt just cram action scenes and cgi into every single scene.",Jurassic World

938,Valorum,Horrible but worth one watch for JP fans just for the visuals.,1,18 October 2015,"The reasons why this movie is a huge disappointment has been thoroughly covered in other reviews. The film is a huge missed opportunity as the envisioned park is stunning. So my 1 star is for the set designers and CGI people. The only weak point I find in this area would be the set of the I.Rex holding pen. No electrified fences on top, no extra security, no armed guards, no observation cameras, just a single (very low) and clearly rather weak concrete wall. The movie leaves you with a total feeling of emptiness at its conclusion. Even J.W's epic ""There it is"" arrival to the island theme is clumsily thrown in at a point where it makes no sense. No tension, no build up, just a pretty facade of a movie with random action sequences thrown in. More thought was put into creating the fake park website then the script and on conceiving an at least borderline believable plot.",Jurassic World

I just had to laugh at the stupidity of it all. Other parts are certainly a good mix of scariness and campiness, but otherwise it is just unforgivable because, unlike Sharknado, the movie wasn't in on the joke of how dumb it was being.Chris Pratt does a great job with his character - very likable and probably the least dumb one. Everyone else is okay but suffers more from the bad writing.Overall, it's a fun movie.

942,bbuskoop,So many unrealistic human reactions/choices..,3,18 May 2020,"Three stars because the acting of Chris Pratt was great (and his character is the only character who uses his brain cells), the last few scenes are good and because, well, they're dinosaurs. For the rest it really sucks and otherwise one star. And don't even get me started on (the ending of) Fallen Kingdom...They shouldn't have made the connection with the original series. Now it just seems like nobody learned anything from what happened last time. If you would state it as a new movie in another dimension, that would make more sense. Besides, who would have thought 'normal' dinosaurs would get boring so the needed to create their own creations?First, it seems that besides the dinosaurs, the reactions/choices of most actors aren't from today's world either. Countless reactions that neither you or me would ever be realistic considering the circumstances in the movie. So, the huge dinosaur, nobody knows what it consists of, escapes. Just shy of 12 people are sent to this mega-dinosaur with non-lethal weapons. Who would have thought that wouldn't work and they would die?Second, the director of the park and that woman (with the pony and bad acting) should long have been in prison for the actions leading to the death of many people. The guy creating the monsters used all the genes from different animals, but nobody thinks of that when designing the defense mechanisms (the thermal-incident)?Third, so when the two kids see a gate to a restricted area which is completely torn apart, they must have turned off their brains. What on Earth made them think 'let's go in here, we'll see some different things!' Unless you have a death wish, no human would go in there. And who would even stay in the field when you're ordered to come back to the station?! That's like staying on a vulcano when you (a) know it might erupt and (b) are ordered to get off the volcano right away. And then you're like 'Nah, I'll just keep going up'.Fourth, going back to the beginning, nobody seems to correct all of the very illogical arguments the guy who wants to make the raptors into weapons makes. Like the wolf he saved and slept in his room, which worked because he had a 'good relationship with'. Soo, you're comparing a cute little wolf to a deathly raptor?Back to the two kids, who escaped the dinosaur. They are in the restricted area, just saw the deathliest monster ever. They enter a door and thought it would be cool to look around. Again the throw-back to the old movies, but how the hell are you acting like it's just a fun walk through memory lane?!'They follow orders'. Maybe this is the most stupid sentence of the movie. In order to hunt down the big dinosaur, the military guy wants to use the reports (that they can control...) to kill the beast. He was JUST at the raptors, seeing that they are not to be controlled quickly - even Chris Pratt spent two years with them. Again, nobody seemed to think it through for a second. Do they accept orders, or do they do as told to get food because they're inprisoned - and if not in prison they would make up their own mind?So, I can name so many more things which show the lack of the ability to use brain cells to think. Like the chopper staying where it is after the dino broke into the deadly birds house (instead of getting out of there asap), the inability to evacuate the island immediately (instead of having a good, fast-working evacuation plan) or that nobody thought to tell (to Pratt or anyone else that could use that information) what the big dino is made off, even after the many deaths he already caused.So, to close of my part of the story, two minutes into the encounter of the raptors with the big dino, they learn the raptors can attack humans after all. VERY SURPRISING TWIST!One of the few interesting parts are in the very beginning when Pratt is with the raptors and at the end where Blue defends Pratt against the mega dino. And who would have thought; the sea dino is the hero in the end, eating the big modified T-Rexraptor.",Jurassic World
943,jafdip,The worst,1,19 March 2017,"This movie is notable for being by far the worst of the series. The miscasting of the central characters is hilarious, and the screenplay is pretty much a lesson in how not to write a script. Bryce Dallas Howard is utterly wasted as Claire Dearing, a wickedly self indulgent and criminally irresponsible character who aroused such a sense of revulsion in me that I spent the rest of the movie hoping something scaly would chew her head off. It was not to be - but more than that, she triumphs, the lesson being that psychopathic bad behavior carries no consequences. There is also a farcical attempt to make her the love interest, again utterly at odds with her character. And as the for the rest, occasionally some good action sequences, too many people who looked like they just time warped out of the 70's, and generally a sour feeling at the end that I just wasted a couple of hours out of my life that will never be reclaimed. See it, but understand it for what it is - second rate garbage.",Jurassic World

945,isabelleholthaus-18311,Jurassic World review- Hunt for a modified killer dinosaur in a jurassic amusement park,10,8 March 2021,"This science-fiction film by the director Colin Trevorrow and the executive producer
Steven Spielberg introduces a new Jurassic park trilogy with new dinosaurs in a new
Jurassic park on the same old Island. The film contains a lot of new characters like Chris
Patt as Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing and Vincent D'Onfrio as Vik
Hoskins. Some characters from the original Jurassic park trilogy are present too like the
chief geneticist Dr. Henry Wu who is played again by B.D.Wong.Jurassic World is about Zach Mitchell, played by Nick Robinson, and Gray Mitchell, played
by Ty Simpkins, visiting their aunt Claire, who is a senior executive in the amusement park
Jurassic World. The dangerous genetically modified Indominus Rex breaks out and the
two children are lost in the forests on the island. Claire and the raptor trainer Owen Grady
go on search for the two and for the dinosaur while Vik Hoskins tries to turn some dinosaurs
into dangerous weapons, including Owen's raptors.The film has an interesting plot that underlines the Jurassic park theme with many new aspects
like the huge number of visitors who are in the park during this time. The plot forms in my opinion
a good basis for the two sequels of the Jurassic World-trilogy. With a new soundtrack that is very
similar to the original one by John Williams, the Jurassic-park-feeling is given back to me. The special
effects deserve a recognition because the dinosaurs look and move very natural to me.All in all, Jurassic World is an excellent film with great special effects and an interesting plot that combines old and new and is recommended for a wide audience.",Jurassic World
946,forrestly7,"Entertaining enough despite the limp script, lack of humor and dreadful acting",6,15 June 2015,"As with its predecessors, the real reason to watch a Jurassic Park movie is for the dinosaurs, in this case, Pterodactyls, a giant prehistoric whale/alligator thing, Raptors and the mega-menacing hybrid protagonist. My reoccurring question throughout this film was who told Chris Pratt he could act?? It's literally one of the most lazy, dreary performances I have yet to see in a Summer blockbuster. Bryce Dallas Howard, on the contrary, can act but she is fed dialogue from an uneven script with many awkward attempts at...well... humor?... I'm guessing? The one refreshing role in this film is the one played by Irrfan Khan, yet here again he suffers from a lame script and a one-trick pony of a running joke about him not flying a helicopter well. Despite watching these one-dimensional characters through 3-D glasses, ""Jurassic World"" is still a semi-fun flick to kick off the Summer. Hopefully it's far from the best of the 2015 Summer blockbusters, however.",Jurassic World
947,grahambrown26,Unexpectedly bad - American Hokum Dressed Up As Entertainment,1,25 June 2015,"I could hardly wait to see this sequel having been a fan of the franchise since the original Jurassic Park was released. Despite the hype and anticipation, after just half an hour of this drivel, I wanted to leave. I wonder which studio official decided this disgraceful insult to the term 'Jurassic' should be distributed in its present form. It seems the first draft of the script outline, with all its plot holes, lack of dramatic tension and predictability was enough to convince them it would be a money spinner and further development was unnecessary before filming started. Conceptually, this is proof, if proof were needed, that the US film-making fraternity are convinced that a movie not full of guns, rockets and helicopters can't be exciting. We have an improbable hunky hero who remains unsweaty, groomed and clean after several days battling dinos in a steamy jungle, a woman (supposed to be a good actress but in this film it is hard to believe) whose idea of jungle attire is designer corporate wear with her sleeves rolled up and high heels. And then there are the kids; both of them have minimal screen presence and their main role contribution is to whimper and be even more stupid than you'd expect. What a polar difference to the pair in Jurassic Park. Spielberg has an expert eye for top notch child acting talent and should at least have been consulted on these two.Apparently there was no upper limit on the budget for special effects and they are superb but the plot is dire in the extreme and so full of holes it can make a true fan cry. Cloying and shameful references to its prequels abounded but they seem inappropriate in a movie that has moved so far from a great concept and cinematography to low-grade video game garbage.Probably the most disappointing movie I have seen in decades.",Jurassic World
948,mochamac,History is Bound to Repeat Itself!,8,10 June 2015,"The events of Jurassic Park were nightmarishly thrilling, and are etched into many a mind along with only the best of the best cinematic moments of years gone by. The events don't, however, seem to be etched well enough into the minds of those running Jurassic World, the massive dinosaur theme park that would leave original visionary, John Hammond, beaming with delight. Set twenty-two years after those fateful events, the fully functioning theme park that now occupies Isle Nublar faces dwindling crowds, as visitors grow weary of familiar attractions. In a bid to draw back the masses, a corporate mandate oversees the creation of a new attraction in the form of a hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus rex. Happily for us, the fun merely begins here; although I am sure the island's occupants would strongly disagree. Effects well advanced for their time were what made the original films stand out, and if the effects were good then, they are phenomenal now. The dinosaurs are so realistic; every twitch on their face as they breathe draws you further into the frantic chaos that unravels. Jurassic World certainly ups the 'wow' factor, leaving you awestruck in childlike wonder. There is no comparison to experiencing the might of some of earth's most fearsome predators, with which humans could most definitely not share the planet. The narrative world grows infinitely vaster as new habitats are explored and new exhibits revealed. As Hammond would insist no expense be spared on the park, it seems no expense was spared on creating the films environments, which are truly a spectacular sight.An early released scene, featuring Chris Pratt's Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing debating the park's new addition, received a brutal assessment from Avengers helmer, Joss Whedon. The apt description is unfortunately not limited to that scene, as the ""70's era sexist"" theme seeps further into the plot than could have been intended. Apart from some dodgy dialogue and an incredibly ill timed love story, the leads pull off their roles well. Owen embodies the essence of an alpha male, quite literally when leading a pack of Velociraptors, and Claire, despite her stickler tendencies, proves that she can hold her own, even if it is in heels throughout.Jurassic World explores an interesting human condition: our tendency to bore easily. In a world where tech grows more refined by the day, and scientific leaps are becoming more regular, there is little left that truly amazes us. So when dinosaurs on display have become the norm, people will naturally want more. This in turn invites scientists to push the limits of what is possible; too far in this case. The park's geneticists experiment with an ancient, extinct species, in an attempt to create bigger and better, without full knowledge and understanding of the potential consequences.While the geneticists play 'design-osaurus', an enclosure is created that proves completely unsuited to the formidable creature it is intended to contain. Far more intelligent and subsequently more dangerous than they could possibly have imagined, the Indominus rex renders the park's resources and infrastructure largely inadequate. In an attempt to swiftly clear up a potential financial and reputational disaster, poor planning and lack of preparedness only exacerbate the situation. Jurassic World's shiny new addition is quickly figuring out where it belongs in the food chain, and what they don't want it to realise is that it holds the top spot.You would think a genetically modified dinosaur would ring instant 'bad idea' alarm bells, but failure to see the magnificent creatures for anything other than assets on a spreadsheet means that history is bound to repeat itself to an epic extent. The action certainly doesn't hold back; these creatures are built to kill and the film shows their immense power with chilling consequence. To top it all off, references to the original films, mostly due to Lowery's (Jake Johnson) fondness for collectibles, serve as delightful treats to fans. Jurassic World is not perfect, but will no doubt be a colossal crowd pleaser.https://lilmac4.wordpress.com",Jurassic World
949,ghoshi-kol,"When Dinosaurs Ruled and They Still Rule: Nostalgia, Bigger, Not the Biggest, Brighter,Not the brightest, The Best Sequel to the 1993 film",7,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World doesn't come closer to the first film but Spielberg's JP will definitely look at Jurassic World with pride. It is indeed the most fitting sequel. It's clear that the corporate sector and humans in general haven't learned from their mistakes. They have created a new hybrid to increase the visitor count to the park. In the process, they have compromised human safety and thoughts of how devastating the consequences would be. That's what JW uses as the primal theme revealing the consequences of the violation of the natural order. The Indominius Rex, a product of human intelligence and progress turns back on it's creators and anything that crosses it's path. Now, it's up to Owen Grady and Claire to contain and restrain the 'killing machine'.Acting: Chris Pratt fits into the skin of Owen Grady. He gives a serious and intense performance. He doesn't make the scenes involving him training the Velociraptors cheesy.Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress. She prove it in ""The Help"" and she has done it again. She is convincing as the serious corporate woman struggling to keep her foot firmly on the floor and her evolution into an action heroine is entertaining.Though Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are fine but Tim and Lex were far better. The latter two had the best scene in the franchise involving the raptors in the kitchen.Direction: Trevorrow goes close to Spielberg in his direction of the film. He took up a linear plot and gave it a fine execution. Hats off to him for providing Jurassic Park with the most fitting sequel.Story: Though the story was far better in the first film, yet the script in JW shines and entertains. It rests firmly on the screenplay that succeeds in entertaining the audiences. The second half was epic and the climax was grand and applause worthy (best in the franchise). Definitely worth the wait, the hype and the money spent.Technical Aspects: The background score is effective as always and carries a feeling of nostalgia with it. The CGI and the animatronics have been well blended. The editing was tight. The only complaint the running time could have been at least 15 minutes longer.Acting: 6.5/10 Direction: 7/10 Story and Screenplay: 6/10+ 8/10= 7/10 Music: 10/10 Technique: 9.5/10",Jurassic World

It tricks the handlers into thinking it left its cage by lowering it's heat signature. I fast forwarded the last 1/3 of the movie because curiosity got the better of me. I had to see how the script writers were going to dig themselves out of this one. Flying dinosaurs are loosed but the story ends without resolving this little fact.

But after a fairly average beginning, the intensity and thrills gradually increase, with some fantastic effects making it all so very watchable.If you go into this film with expectations above what the film is trying to be, then you will no doubt be disappointed.

955,dlpchandra,Sensationalism over sense,3,20 June 2015,"Gone are the days when the Jurassic was an enchanting world of majestic creatures. These are just dumb brutes, the characters even more so. The characters are all a waste of screen time, except that the dinos need some fodder to chase and munch on. If you're a fan or have even seen the original JP1, and JP2, don't watch this. It'll leave you with remorse, regrets and a bad after taste. It is more comparable to JP3 in the lack of either a suspense thriller plot or a grip on story telling.However, if you're in it only for the action, VFX, and some beast on beast action, you may get your fill, because that's where all the money (a lot, I heard) seems to have been spent. Don't forget to switch off your common sense and self respect though, for yet another mindless action 'block buster'. This may officially be r.i.p for the franchisee as it once was.",Jurassic World
956,kinglyostrich,Formulaic money making product.,5,14 June 2015,"In Jurassic World flat characters predictably run from a ridiculous reptile while the film pretends to be self aware... brought to you by Mercedes Benz, Coca-Cola, Beats, Samsung and many more great companies. Let's start by admitting that none of the Jurassic Park movies were ever more than just big summer blockbusters, Jurassic Park wasn't a flawless movie and it doesn't contribute much artistically. That being said I still thoroughly enjoy the original and think it's very well put together. Jurassic World on the other hand is a bit of a jumbled up confused mess with hints of fun. SPOILERSAs the movie starts we are introduced to the two kids we will follow throughout the film: excited young boy and moody teenager who likes girls. While we are on the subject of characters, every single one is terrible. Bryce Dallas Howard plays woman whose job is important, Judy Greer and Andy Buckley play parents who are getting a divorce and despite everyone's praises for Chris Pratt he simply plays cool guy.Once arriving on the island the movie pretends to give characterization but in reality just shows the characters as flatter than pancakes by showing them act in one exact way, never changing. This is when the movie gets unbearably cheesy by making fun of its self in its advertising and that dinosaurs apparently aren't enough anymore but is so shameless that it doesn't try to fix the issues. Chris Pratt saves someone and talks back to a corporate boss to emphasize that he's really cool and we discover he is the alpha of a group of velociraptors, because he feeds them? Never mind that now the genetically modified lizard turns out to have superpowers and has escaped it's enclosure. Plot conveniences are not sprinkled throughout, Trevorrow just grabbed a bag of them and called it a movie. ""We need to get out of here but this car is busted."" ""Remember when we fixed up grandpa's truck?"" Genius writing. Someone wants to weaponize the creature and then he dies in what would be ironic if it wasn't already so obvious.Some more stuff happened with terrible camera-work and CGI that is over stylized leading up to the grand finale that was practically announced at the start of the picture. The spectacle is gone and cramming more things onto the screen doesn't make a movie better. The simpleness of the original is why it still holds up today. Movies need to be grounded in a bit of reality or they fall apart and become less grandjeur and more of just a bore. The movie has such an overwhelming anti corporate mantra but it spits into the wind as people line up and give the film, scratch that, Samsung, hundreds of millions. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I yawned but wasn't terribly disappointed overall. 58/100",Jurassic World
957,ASreeram,Very enjoyable yet a little predictable...,8,19 June 2015,"Jurassic World is definitely the 2nd best movie in the franchise so far, right behind the first Jurassic Park. J.W.'s mix of humor, action, adventure, horror, and suspense makes it a great movie for anyone to enjoy. The movie is about Jurassic World, a theme park dedicated to dinosaur-themed attractions. Every time a new attraction is released, attendance spikes. One of the park's high officials, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), talks about a genetically modified hybrid, something no one has ever seen before, to be the next big attraction. It is known as the Indominus Rex. The movie features Chris Pratt as Owen, a man who has a lot of experience dealing with dinosaurs and proves to be very useful. As you've probably already predicted, things go awfully wrong in this movie. Some of these things are very unrealistic and would never happen in real life. At that point in the movie, I wanted to give it an 8 or 7. As I advanced further, the witty remarks, brilliant acting, and stunning visual effects made me forget the minor plot holes and such and made me truly love this movie. The movie is mostly rated PG-13 for its bloody scenes, which there are a few of, and its frightening jump scares, which are relatively frequent. All in all, Jurassic World is a great movie for the family, although younger viewers might get scared at some parts. If its story wasn't predictable at times, it would easily be the best Jurassic Park movie ever made.",Jurassic World

959,carlyrist,Solid Fun,7,25 July 2015,"I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. I've only seen the original, which I thoroughly enjoy, but I had heard that the sequels were terrible. Because of that, I did not expect this one to deliver anything special in terms of plot or character. With a dinosaur movie, there's only so much you can do and, as this was intended to give the franchise new life, it is unsurprising that they would ignore plot and character in favor of really cool dinosaurs. And after seeing the movie, I was totally okay that they did. Yes, we had seen the stock characters before, but they were likable enough and didn't detract from the movie at all. In fact, I really liked Chris Pratt's Owen and his deep care for the animals he worked with and his paternal nature. I also really enjoyed the genetic modification aspect of it because it did ring true to our society where we are so easily bored and demand more without thinking about consequences. Apart from that, I liked the dinosaurs. It was a fun run away from the monster movie that delivered on the action. While there was nowhere near as much suspense as in the first movie, that did not make it unenjoyable. In particular, seeing the film in IMAX, the final showdown did not disappoint. All in all, if you're looking for an unique plot or great character development, this is not the movie to watch. However, it did succeed in being a fun summer blockbuster, which is exactly what it should have been.",Jurassic World
960,scaredsblood,Not as horrible as some of the past sequels / prequels,6,22 June 2015,"It's a decent Jurassic Park movie that uses a similar formula from the first Jurassic Park. The problem that this movie suffers from that the originally didn't, is that we have seen this type of movie already and not just from Dinosaurs anymore but also from Alien-Machines that turn into Cars, Mutants and let's not forget about every disaster movie that has happened since the first Jurassic Park up until the time of this Jurassic World sequel. Is it bad? No, it's not a ""bad"" movie, he has the same feel and pacing as the first and it doesn't try to be innovative at all really but as it stands people (us) are just not entertained by this genre of man vs. nature anymore and because of that the overall feel of this movie will not be as ""awe-inspiring"". It's still that franchise that can entertain the family though and does it without having to go complete Disney/Pixar. This is the type of movie that a family with kids that have outgrown the cheesy overdone Pixar stuff but a more adult type of feel to it.",Jurassic World
961,abiramone,Trevorrow Brought 'em Back From Extinction,8,10 June 2015,"Even I already aware of the danger of over-expectations towards summer movies, Jurassic World is one of few movies that I already grew hopes in. I followed its news since its first announcement. Thats because I grew up as a 90's boy who watch Jurassic Park as one of reference to pop culture. I watched this movie on its premiere with big hype. No doubt. The purpose of this movie is to make something bigger, louder, and more 'teeth' than its predecessors. They decide to make 'super soldier' dinosaur due to its hybrid genetics to make more money from the park. Goosebumps that I had in every scene that shown nostalgic reference from Jurassic Park is a real fairytale ride. Lot of new dinosaurs appeared, but in some scenes the CGI is not 'that' good. I would still prise the realism of Jurassic Park with its level of graphic even if it has 22 years of margin. The actors did their best for their roles. its not their fault if the depth of the characters is a bit shallow. Chris Pratt did pretty good job as raptor's alpha Owen Grady to be 'something tougher' than Sam Neill's Alan Grant or Jeff Goldblum's Malcolm. And for the red- headed- Bryce Dallas Howard, somehow the writers made something excellent for her to beautify the whole show. And for the rest of the casts, like I told you before, they made their point.But, again, some holes in the movie will make you raise your eyebrows. First, if the authority already know what's the consequences to organize one hell of a dinosaur park (they should know what the hell happened to the first park, don't they?), why wouldn't they put armed security around the dino's containments? A super- genetically hybrid- Indominus Rex is out of her cage and you're not even that 'alert'? You put this fat, slow and sleepy worker to watch her? Second, ehm, the raptor cage. How tall is it? It is reported that an adult raptor can jump approx. 12 ft. high. But that cage doesn't look like it is that high. if its true, With only one or two jumps, Owen and the rest of the crew would be a perfect lunch for the raptor boyband because they comfortably stand on the top of it. Seems with no electrical fence or something safe to be the additional security on the top of it. They are g***amn raptors, folks! You wouldn't want to mess with them. Third, again, they didn't learn the mistakes Jurassic Park made. Howard's character is shown made a phone call to her 'puberty hit' teenager nephew and couldn't make it thru due to bad signal. Why didn't they even put a single communication device on the ball- vehicle thing? a 300 dollar satellite phone on it wouldn't hurt anybody.In my opinion, this movie generally still wouldn't surpass the original Jurassic Park, but its definitely better then the second and the third one.Overall, still, as a summer movie, Jurassic World put it together. But not just a summer movie. We're talking about a movie that already started the hype 22 years ago. A nostalgic hell of a ride with bigger, louder and more 'teeth'. Indeed.",Jurassic World
962,zt12345,John Hammonds Flea Circus,1,12 June 2015,"Sorry that it is unprofessional and hammy, but - rant is what I need, rant is what I do- mutiny, anarchy- lets go.Ah. Where do I begin? That I have lost faith in humanity? Michael Crichton is spinning in his grave, grieving. Critics praise this Reboot... To be ""suitable for new generation"" I feel sorry for that new generation. 1993 Jurassic Park is an all time classic. This is a very poor B-class movie. Like Ouija or Age of Extinction - or any other CGI heavy summer flick that will trend for a week, then is sold in Pound Shops. But I waited for it. Since 2001. 1993 is an all time classic, it had great characters, it was based and explored science- genetic engineering in time when it was just a myth- the effects were groundbreaking, moral suitable, humour dry and dark but indirect- it was classic. This is a poor parody that tries to be funny (it isn't). CGI is apparent to such extent, if JP1 was out now, it would've beaten it by mile. I laughed a lot- because of the bleakness of the story (If this was on TV, when Pratt and dinosaurs ""talk"", in first 10 minutes, I would've considered switching it off). My little paleontological heart broke in million pieces, but, at least they have subtly mentioned bird evolution, but rest- caricatures- flying reptiles rampaging, eating people (fish eaters, sorry), dinosaurs talking to em that hybrid thing (bleak design)(ignore), by the end two dinosaurs and a marine reptile ""team up"" to defeat the ""baddie"" dinosaur, yeah, that's the plot. I would've said it is for three year old audience, but then, there was a five year old sitting close to me and she fell asleep. Gah, these dinosaurs really didn't have anything to eat. This movie underlines world dinosaur and associates them with blood thirsty, giant scaly monsters. While in fact, majority of dinosaurs were size of a pony, many of carnivores possibly scavengers, and chunk of sauropods covered in feathers. This creates wrong image for entire field, 1992 movie inspired generation of palaeontologists; while this may trend as an app buy-in-game trend for five year old, and be forgotten as soon as identical new thing emerges. John William tune was underused, and anyway, something of such superiority should not be used in this thing. There was no ""ahh! Lovely"" Scene which is so trademark to the trilogy. (and The William theme should play in that scene.) I would've given it points if it was there. Because the theme on its own made my eyes wet. My favorite aspects were the call backs to the first movie, such as John Hammond sculpture, visit of the old visitor area, the blurred copy of Ian Malcolm book, Dr Henry Wo, that talkative DNA double helix. But it was in form of Easter eggs, not enough. There was a lot of repetitive dull humour, which was both corny and in all ways funny-not (actually it was funny, because of its badness?). The actors are terrible, but that may be fault of the poor paced, Cartoon script- (Lego Movie had more realistic characters.) Chris Pratt was better as Emmet, than this Owen guy (you named him after a palaeontologist? You sly things) who was an oh ah Raptor whisperer. Gah, this hurts. Other interesting points -Cuttlefishes make a re-appearance as nightmare inducing monsters (first one being in the Avengers movie), I actually think they are cute, always look happy -Remember PS1 game JP: Warpath? I want to play it again -Jimmy Fallon cameo... That made me happy. -If there is going to be a cinema-sin counter, this movie would require two twenty minute videos to count all the ridicules -But imagine this billionaire guy being played by Robert D. Jr. Imagine. ""World is shredding to pieces. But don't look at me like it is my fault."" ""People are dying, but, hey, look DINOSAURS"" -Product Placements -Beats make a reappearance -Much of this movie felt like Mercedes Benz expo -I would've preferred to be on that expo -Steven Spielberg, I am loosing faith in you buddy, stop ""producing"" stuff like this -Amblin logo had a nice make over This one- they, they put JP banner on fire, that's a great metaphor for entire movie. Recently I have broken my star system because Birdman was ""too great to fit into the category"". This movie broke my system again because I want to give it a negative numbers. It is a 20/100 movie, but, personal damage slices it to -10/100. Congratulations Hollywood.And don't riposte with: ""You don't know what fun means"", ""Treat it as a stand alone movie"", ""It is just a summer flick"". Because this movie is an original follow up to the original much more thought provoking movie, and it should at least try and live up to its intellectual standard.

968,lupitag-11852,Best since the original with some great scenes.,8,12 June 2015,"Granted, it isn't that hard to top the previous two installments in this franchise, but Jurassic World is the closest thing to experiencing the cinematic thrill of the original that we're most likely ever going to get. The formula is practically summer audience fool-proof: show us a fully-functioning dinosaur theme park John Hammond envisioned in the original film, throw in a dangerous new hybrid created to be the new star attraction, set star attraction loose on unsuspecting park, and let the fun begin. Simple setup, great execution.What made the original so great to me was the sense of awe we felt at seeing dinosaurs depicted so realistically on screen coupled with the film's fantastic action set pieces. This is 2015, so clearly the park's native attractions are CGI and seeing a photo-realistic dinosaur on screen lost its ""wow"" factor some time ago, but what this film does recreate well are the fantastic set pieces reminiscent of classic scenes from the original such as the Jeep attack. You'll be whooping with delight during a certain sequence involving a gyrosphere ride, and let's just say the park's other patrons will NOT be having a good day. It all sets the scene for massive panic on a grand scale, which is something the original could never accomplish with its characters fighting for survival in a non-functioning theme park. Yes, this time around, we see many a tourist in danger (a certain scene involving pterodactyls ranks as a highlight of the movie), and there is no shortage of action once things get rolling.Those worried they'll stepping into a Michael Bay-esque action-a-thon need not fret: there's plenty of establishment of the primary characters and a slow (for this day and age) buildup to the action which really kicks in once the new hybrid decides she wants to finally see what's outside of her paddock...The characters are all likable and we have the requisite human villains to even it out some (let's just say you'll be rooting for the dinosaurs in some scenes) and the new hybrid is an imposing and credible new dinosaur villain that is worthy of taking the reigns from the T-Rex and the Raptors from previous films.What's more, the final 15 minutes are the best of any film in the franchise thus far--I was thoroughly impressed with the scope and scale of the finale and easily consider it the highlight of the movie, by far. You will be in action/adventure heaven just witnessing it.Dinosaurs attacking tourists, great action set pieces like the original, humor, characters just likable enough to root for, and a terrific finale: what more could you want from a summer blockbuster? Go see Jurassic World and enjoy yourself. Yes, it's not the answer to life as we know it, and there might not be much beneath the surface, but the movie is pure spectacle and sometimes that's all we need.",Jurassic World

This sequel to the 1993 classic Jurassic Park almost stands as tall as the original. Chris Pratt was more of the same as in Guardians of the Galaxy, but that isn't a bad thing at all. In fact his humor, strong line delivery, and charisma make him the best lead in a Jurassic film to date. That is quite the feat in my opinion as Sam Neil was excellent in Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3. While Chris Pratt is the stand out of the sequel, Bryce Dallas Howard also makes for a fun romp by providing funny and serious acting at its best.The story centers around a new breed of dinosaur created in a lab. Things ultimately go very wrong for the park. And while this may sound generic it was executed in excellent fashion. Colin Trevorrow's big budget debut was one if not the most impressive in the last 10 years. While there is a lot of action and humor in this film there is also a lot of nostalgia. Especially when we finally get a action packed sequence involving the T-Rex.To end my review, if your a fan of any of the original 3, this one is by far the best since the first. To some it may be even as great or perhaps better. This franchise has truly been brought back to life.8/10.",Jurassic World
971,Makarios55,A voyage back in time,6,27 July 2015,"Flashback: About 22 years ago, i sat at home with my aunt to play some card games. The reason behind it: my parents were out to watch a new movie: Jurassic Park. I, myself, didn't know anything about it. But that did change soon when the VHS came out (yeah, VHS...nowadays nearly as extinct as the dinosaurs...). I watched it over and over again. Dr. Alan Grant was my new hero, i wanted to become an archaeologist (which i didn't)and collect all kind of dinosaurs (which i kinda did back then).Fast forward to now. When i first heard that another JP-movie would come out, i was excited. The premiere came, i read some informations, some reviews and so on, but it took until now for me to watch it. And now, i'm really unsure what to think about it. I expected a popcorn-summer-movie-blockbuster and kinda got it. There were plenty of well done and impressive effects, dinosaurs looked amazing (even if i personally prefer the ones from the first movie, but that's just personal taste) and the whole park with the big gate and all gave me nostalgic feel, reminding me of the first time i heard that marvellous theme accompanied by the breathtaking pictures of majestic dinosaurs so many years ago. But what was the old JP really about? Humanity crossing the borders of science, reaching territory it shouldn't reach. People taking money over reason, playing god and getting their comeuppance, from nature and from themselves. And unwilling, mostly innocent persons like Grant or the kids getting caught up with this and being tossed in a habitat they aren't used to, struggling for survival. Jurassic World reused this theme, which is not bad at all, but it was much more shallow. Scientist created a new killer dinosaur and it gets out. That's all. No Dennis Nedry who gets greedy and endangers all around him. It just gets out because standard security protocol is apparently ""oh, there is a dinosaur bred to kill in the paddock, but i can't see it right now...well, before we try to use the implanted tracking device to find out where it is, let's send some people in there to look around"" And when the I-Rex is out he goes around killing everything, more like a slasher villain than the dinosaurs hunting for food we were used to. And the human villain: I really like Vincent D'Onofrio. He is a good actor, especially when he's playing villains. But this time: A cliché-military man who wants to use the dinos as a weapon. I honestly didn't think i would see something like this outside of a cheap b-movie... Apart from this: why use dinosaurs as a weapon? In a real war, couldn't you just shoot theme like everything else? And wouldn't they be more expensive than a tank or a bomber or jet? But enough of that. What i really missed where the more peaceful scenes of the first few movies. In all three, after the action started, there were a few scenes that were much calmer to build up the story before there was action again. This time, after the i-Rex-breakout, every calmer scene is just a quick build-up for the next action sequence. Maybe new movies are like that, but i don't like it. Just a few scenes with Crichton-like dialogue to give a meaning to everything else or scenes with herbivores, to remind us that it is really nature and its balance everything is about, not an all-around war where everything kills everybody all the time. Another point is the pacing. Everything happens really fast. Nothing like the famous T-Rex-breakout from the first one with its masterfully done build-up from ripples in the water to shadows moving in the rain and so on. As a result there is much action, but little suspense. No subtle thrills, just blockbuster-action which is just not as memorable.As for the actors: The stars are the dinosaurs. The human actors are much less important without any depth or anything you could call character development. First of all there is Chris Pratt as the motorcycle-driving, raptor-training hero. As cool as that sounds, it just doesn't feel like a person. I generally like Chris Pratt when he plays kinda goofy characters like in Guardians of the Galaxy, who are still heroes, despite some flaws. This time it feels more like an unkillable hero of an 80s action movie, but no one you could in any way relate to. Bryce Dallas Howard was...OK....you either like her or not. Or you don't really care, like me. At least she can act, even if the role itself is a little inconsistent in detail. Still better than most other characters in this one. The boys...well, many people don't like child-actors and those two really don't make it better. The older one is a cliché-teenager who is really pushing the limits of taking dumb decisions (oh, if Hollywood-conventions would allow to kill off kids...)And the younger one... is just forgettable. The only reason for them to be in this movie is for Claire to take the whole thing personally. And because there were always kids in JP-movies. Most of all, i don't really care for them and their story at all. Everyone else i supporting cast we know almost nothing about, maybe apart from Masrani...Now, if anyone could tell me why he had to pilot that helicopter and die trying? All in all, it is a action-packed blockbuster movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Pure CGI-entertainment without any real depth or meaning or , god forbid, logic. It's OK to watch if you are looking for exactly this. But it lacks the memorability of the first two movies. It is still better than JP3, but I highly doubt that it will reach the legendary status the first two have reached, high-crossing or not.",Jurassic World
972,ethangaines,..........Pretty Bad.,4,30 August 2015,"Extremely disappointing. I was thinking about hitting the ""spoiler alert"" button but this movie was so recycled and dry that there was no need. Let me first address the acting. Pretty bad. Ty Simpkins (Insidious) gave the best performances and even outshined Chris Pratt, who is usually outstanding, but he was mildly amusing and too badass for a Chris Pratt like character. The film was lazy, poorly executed and it was one of the few films where I wanted it to be over. Save for some good but not great CGI and special effects, the movie was not stunning nor extraordinary like a Jurassic movie should be. They didn't even bother explaining anything, they simply dove right into the action that people distinguish as ""a good movie"". However, I am a huge fan of Chris Pratt and I always enjoy seeing him even if he's not his usual self. He's not that great of an actor, he can play one character, the goofy, lovable, mildly stupid hero, but he still somehow delivered to me even through his mediocre performance.

Here goes a movie about the actual park with dinosaurs as it's opened to the public. Everything's wonderful until the biggest, baddest dinosaur escapes! The movie stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, along with some kids that were hilarious! They had me in tears when the dinosaur was chasing them. Wait, I wasn't supposed to be laughing? Oh. But seriously, the acting is fine for what it has to be. For me it's a hard movie to review because I'm pretty neutral on it. Everything was just fine. Nothing was spectacular, everything was pretty bland. Well let's at least start somewhere. Is there any characterization? Well, it's about as one dimensional as you can get but at least their not card board cut outs. Chris Pratt plays Owen, and he's reminiscent of a young, one note Han Solo. The only part I actually felt myself enjoying thoroughly was the end action scene, and that's just because it was mind numbing action that I could turn my brain off for. If you pay attention to detail, you can nitpick just about every little plot point to pieces, which is a huge problem, not just with this movie, but with many movies today. It just shows that there was barely any effort put into it. They mostly likely wrote a quick script, slapped the Jurassic Park name onto it and released it. I've been hearing a lot of ""It was good compared to the other blockbusters we get"", ""It was better than the sequels"", which brings up the question: Is that the bar? Is the bar so low for movies that when we get a mediocre one we have to force ourselves to enjoy it and say that it's the best we're gonna get? No. We should be demanding better films and more effort but the average movie goer doesn't care enough. We shouldn't be accepting decent films because they're better than other ones that come out. The bar needs to be higher. All in all though, Jurassic World isn't terrible. It's fine. It's whatever. It's a movie. Don't go into this expecting a great action thrill ride. You'll merely get some enjoyment. The end action scene is fun but other than that the movie is pretty bland. 6/10.",Jurassic World

Jeezus Christ, there is so many product placements in this movie. Let's see there is a samsung, coco cola, Mercedes, and tons more product placement. It is SO out of place and cringe worthy. Seriously get your act together. OK I'm done ranting about the ads in the movie. The characters are so ONE DIMENSIONAL and forgetful. The cgi is TERRIBLE compared to the old ones which used real animotronic dinosaurs. Instead of this computer generated crap. This flick is absolutely Mediocre. The original Jurrasic park by Spielberg was a testament of time and included fresh new cinematic scenes. But this abomination is absolutely ATROCIOUS. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, i slept through this movie half way through.PLEASE IF YOU ARE A JURRASIC PARK FAN, avoid this prehistoric extinct mess.Just ''Run'' away from this movie. no pun intended.",Jurassic World
975,mariya-mustafaeva,What is happening when the previous experience doesn't teach you at all!,7,23 October 2015,"""Jurassic World"" is the continuation of the greatest story of all time about dinosaurs ""Jurassic Park"". I had so much expectations regarding this movie, but unfortunately it turned out to be not so satisfactory as i expected.The plot is most stolen from the Jurassic Park. A lot of episodes resemble the first part, but without the same spirit of suspense, tension and soul. ""Jurassic Park"" is the movie of my childhood, i remember my feelings after first watching it. It was something inexplicable, i desired to become a paleontologist and to create something like Jurassic Park. While the new one is just a blockbuster, well-done for sure, but without the proper atmosphere. But, at the same time, i can't say that it is extremely bad. As a separate movie it is much fascinating, but without any meaning. I like they added a lot of funny situations, but it was needless to create the new individuum. T-rex is a perfect prehistoric murderer and to invent something between T-Rex and Raptors is the foolish thing ever. I understand they were trying to invent a bike, but it doesn't work. The scene with Chris Patt trains a Raptors is great and entertaining and maybe it would be possible to implement if the people had been lived with dinosaurs. Raptors are the most intelligent prehistoric dinosaurs, hypotetically it could be. The 3d effect, the scenery and the movie in general is well-done, but not in comparison with the first one. As an entertaining movie it is worth watching.",Jurassic World
976,jpeterseni,Top Review is Shill Nonsense,3,4 December 2017,This is NOT a good movie.IMO this is the worst of all of them. The plot is nonsense. The CGI is over the top and takes you out of any kind of immersion.The ending is predictable. The characters are bland. There isn't much you can redeem from this movie. I guess some of the ties to the original location is alright. Jake Johnson is cool,Jurassic World

Did we watch something different?This movie contains almost no character development. I seriously can't even remember their names by this point. Also, the cliches with the stories were plentiful. The CGI was overdone and the entire movie leaves the audience feeling detached from reality.Seriously, give this one a pass. By far the wort Jurassic movie.",Jurassic World
978,millenniumfalcon-33591,Running in high heels... Unbelievable!,7,14 December 2015,"No doubt Jurassic World is better than the mess called ""Jurassic Park 3"" but sadly, it's nowhere near the gems that were the first and second movies. I mean, who actually places a lady like Bryce Dallas Howard to look pretty and, believe it or not, run from a snarling, angry dinosaur in HIGH HEELS?Furthermore, while our friend the T-Rex was the main dinosaur for the previous movies, he seems to have become a sideshow this time round. It would have been nice to see the T-Rex come up earlier and get involved in a big fight with that Indominous Rex (together with the Raptors), rather than just at the end. And as for that Indominous fellow, why use a genetically engineered dinosaur? They should have taken one of several newly-discovered creatures instead, as a means of both introducing a new villain and showcasing such a brand new species to the world!Speaking of the Raptors, doesn't it seem rather ill-conceived that Chris Pratt's character actually has that Alpha bond with the four ""members"" of the Raptor Squad? Sure, all four of them helped to fight the Indominous but they were definitely outmatched throughout, which is why it would have been better for T-Rex to do the job instead!Of course the movie does have its good points, especially the part where the Pteranodons attacked the people after being set free by I-Rex (including that one unfortunate girl carried high into the air) and when the big water dinosaur jumped out of his pool to both eat the shark as well as I-Rex later. The part where the four Raptors accompanied Chris Pratt on his motorbike while looking for the I-Rex is also a memorable scene, one that also became some sort of meme in the end!Anyway, while not exactly the best dinosaur movie, ""Jurassic World"" is still a good movie to catch on a boring Saturday night at home. It's just not exactly awards-worthy, unfortunately! XD",Jurassic World

So was excited to hear there was a new one.It was good. But it just didn't have the same suspense that first one did. After the first we all consider how we would escape if we came face to face with a raptor! I thought they could have done more with Claire. She didn't know her nephews because obviously successful women cant have a personal life. When things were going south, she should have disappeared for a few minutes and re appeared in combats with a ready for action attitude. We all like the fantasy of being rescued by a strong man like Owen, but thought for 2015 Claire was a bit cliché, helpless woman.They could have done more. But overall I enjoyed it.

982,shailakumbhare-83719,An easy way to make a buck off of people (like me) who love dinosaurs so much they'll watch no matter what,4,11 July 2018,"The creative geniuses over at Hollywood have concocted yet another sequel to unnecessarily reprise a series. Jurasic World is full of cliches and scenes stolen straight from the original. Bryce is your stereotypical privileged city-girl who thinks she knows best because she is in a high powered career. But, at the end of the day she's just a woman and needs Pratt, the equally stereotypical, brawny, cowboy to swoop in and save her with his wilderness skills and masculineness. The brothers that are lost in the park are so generic I can't remember what they look like or anything that they did throughout the whole thing- and I just watched it. The main villain is a genetically altered dinosaur that's supposed to be new and exciting to tourists- but it pretty much just looks like a bigger T-Rex. It has a hodge-podge of powers like camouflage and heat detection, which it rarely uses and has super intelligence. Sure, its a hybrid of many types of dinosaurs but none of the dinosaurs that it was created from would be intelligent enough to create a sophisticated ruse in order to escape or know what a tracking device is. Then, it goes on a sadistic killing-spree for absolutely no reason except plot. Animals don't do this! Not even the really smart ones! Another thing that doesn't make sense: despite super dino roaming the island, determined to exterminate all life Bryce still refuses to evacuate because it may lose money for the park. This just makes her character feel false. She wouldn't be this cold, no way. 
All that being said, watching dinosaurs run around is just fun. No matter how senseless and forced the plot is dinosaurs are awesome and seeing them on screen will always be entertaining. I love dinosaurs so much I'll give it a whole 4 stars.",Jurassic World

984,dcipledude,A refreshing sequel to Jurassic Park 1,10,19 June 2015,"No movie should ever get a 10 but I gave it a 10 because it delivered the best Jurassic sequel possible. Don't read the negative reviews by some who argue that the main characters do stupid, illogical things, that the story is predictable, blah blah. Walking into the theater, 22 years after I saw the first Jurassic Park in 1993 as a teenager, I had the following expectations: a full working Jurassic Park with lots of visitors and exciting attractions built on the foundations laid out by Jurassic Park 1, kids getting into trouble, a male (or female) lead who do ballsy things and cool dinosaurs whose realism should surpass the previous 3 Jurassic movies. And that is exactly what Colin Trevorrow delivered. The dinosaurs look bad ass ; the hybrid dinosaur is believable and the velociraptors rule the movie. The pace is fast, the actors well cast and lots of people die. I won't spoil it any further so you just have to know that you can feel throughout the movie that it was directed by a new generation of directors who understand better than the old masters (Spielberg) how to combine humour, cgi, action and a tight direction. Humour you say ? Yes, Trevorrow manages to put in lots of funny bits even at tense moments and watch very closely to the dozens of winks to the first Jurassic Park movie he put in. The movie's score is somewhat in the background and makes full use of the original score by John Williams which was a smart move by composer Michael Giacchino, he knew not to try and do better than Williams. At certain scenes it was so quiet in the theater you could hear a pin drop so a bombastic score would simply have ruined it. Oh and the last 15 minutes .. pure epic dinosaur magic.",Jurassic World

986,s-01154,How I would rewrite Jurassic world,1,8 November 2019,"This was the most disappointing film of all time in my opinion. Jurassic fans like myself have waiting for the perfect fourth installment of the Jurassic franchise to come after Jurassic Park 3. And when it was announced in 2012 that the fourth installment was titled Jurassic World, we all lost our minds. And some people genuinely enjoyed this film, and viewed this as an enjoyable and a popcorn movie, and an action packed film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. In Other words, it was a fast and furious film with dinosaurs in the middle of it. While others like my self saw this as an utter disappointment to the franchise. My head was hung way too low after I saw this film. And this is this is how I would chose to rewrite the film:The story follows a fully functional park in the distant but near future, as a strange man who works for Bio Sin, Ingen's rival (Ingen is the company that runs Jurassic park and Jurassic world) shuts down all systems in the park, leaving it with no power, no electricity, complete darkness, loose dinosaurs, a completely shut down Jurassic World. This would leave quite a scary, dark, and horrific setting for the characters to face.Make this film the first rated r film of the franchise. A PG 13 film could be released alongside for kids to watch. But the real movie is rated r. Meaning full on gore and blood and violence. So decapitated heads, limbs, bloody carcase, etc. There are also some Horror elements implemented too. Many stunning horror scenes could be shot especially with the raptors. This will be the first movie where children characters in this film die.One horror scene would include an Ingen Soldier in a dark hallway, he lights a flare to see where to go. But as he walks he hears a suttle snarl or growl if you will. And as he looks around to see what's going on, he looks up slowly and and sees a velociraptor up on a vent in the ceiling. The soldier pulls out a pistol, aims for the raptor, and shoots. He misses and raptor roars and jumps on him. As the raptor claws his back, the soldier tries to crawl his way out if the hallway, and this is where the gore comes into play. As he drags himself across the floor, he leaves a trail if blood smeared across. The raptor then snaps the soldier's neck with his mouth, and feeds on his intestines.Keep the previous dinosaur designs from the previous films of the franchise. One of the most disappointing things about the whole film was its cartoony and fake dinosaur designs. The completely changed Rexy's appearance, the raptors look disgusting and outlandish, the pteranodons look like pigeons with crests, and the stegosaurs look like they got ripped from the pages of a dinosaur book in the 1960s. Rexy's design should stay true to how she looked in Jurassic Park. The Velociraptors should keep their Jurassic Park 3 designs, but change they're colours to differentiate between the Jurassic World and Jurassic Park designs, and the Male Raptors should have more feathers. The pteranodons should keep they're Lost World or Jurassic Park 3 designs, although I prefer the Jurassic Park 3 designs as they look more menacing but The Lost World designs look good too. And finally the stegos should keep The Lost World designs exactly the same unchanged.The visual effects should be delt with the same way they were delt with in the original Jurassic Park. Jurassic World had one of the most cartoony and fake CGI ever in my opinion. The original Jurassic Park that came out in 1993 had one of the most stunning CGI shots in all of cinema history. We live in an era of technology, this should not happen. This Jurassic World should be done the same way Jurassic Park was. Stan Winston animatronics and puppets for close ups, and CGI for wide shots.Characters include Owen Grady but not a raptor trainer (we are not going the military dinosaur route at all) Tim Murphay, Lex Murphay, Tim's children and Lex's children, Simon Hammond whi is John Hammond's son (John hammond created the first Jurassic Park) Ian Malcom and Ellie Satler and Alan Grabt although they won't be on Isla Nublar.The Park will include a large futuristic Visitor's Center, not like the one in Jurassic World, a pachycephalosurus fighting arena, two separate Rex enclosures, one that includes Rexy, and another that includes a feathered T-Rex, a Raptor family pen, and aviary with Pteranodons and Ramphyrincus, a carnotaurus forest, a dilophosaurus pen showcasing hunting shows of them hunting down cows and goats, Baryonix and Suchomimus River, a large herbivore valley which includes Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, Pachyrinosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Diplodocus, Iguanadon, Stegosaurs, Kentrosaurus, and many more. Other enclosures include Spinosaurs Lake, the aquarium which includes creatures like Leoplorodon, plesiosaurus, elasmosaurus, etc. Transports around the park include advanced Jeeps for the rangers, a much larger monorail, a submarine ride around the aquarium with non carnivorous creatures, and ranger car tours around the herbivore valley, and a large transport in the gallimimus herd.This is how I would rewrite Jurassic World. In my opinion this would make for a more compelling and stunning story. I believe the audience would be at the edge of their seats, and frightened when watching this.",Jurassic World

But the worst part of Jurassic World is the painfully bad and cliché acting. You will like this movie if enjoy wooden performances, kids struggling to cry about their parent's divorce, and forced Summer Blockbuster love interests. You will also like this movie if you enjoy watching whiny kids roll around in a glass ball complaining about their parents' divorce.

989,Arm-Lizard,"The Park Is Awesome, Yet...",5,10 June 2015,"It was cool and fun to watch Jurassic World, yet it didn't deliver what I was expecting. I don't want to jump to hasty conclusions, the movie was good, above good, and it has some mesmerizing very well-made sequences and amazing action, but it lacked something... a spirit maybe.Yes, its very heavy on the nostalgia, and yes there are moments that will bring tears to your eyes if you are a die-hard fan, also it's full of Easter eggs, but the awe and wonder were not enough. Some said that Jurassic World is the best sequel since the original, maybe it tops ""The Lost world"" at some parts, but The Lost World has more strength points over it. If you are expecting it to be more then a generic creature film, I think then it is not the one for you.I actually don't know how to feel, and the funny thing is that all the issues I worried about, turned out to be the best stuff in the movie. The I. rex, the semi-friendly raptors, the Apatasaurus head. They even threw a line that explains the scientific inaccuracies in the dinosaurs, now everything is acceptable within the universe. On the other hand, the story had its corny parts, and It lacked depth, there wasn't any kind of scientific debate as to the first 2 movies, nothing at all.The CGI was beyond awesome, settle down all your fears, It's perfect, and works very well on the big screen. Only a couple of moments you may feel that it's a little off. The T. rex, oddly and unfortunately, she was the least impressive CGI in the movie, along with the Ankylosaurus.The animatronic shot was brilliant, I wonder why they didn't use more animatronics, as from what I've seen they seem to have improved vastly over the years. There were many close-ups here, especially for the Raptors, that animatronics would have worked perfectly for, but they didn't go with that option.It will take more than one viewing to really see everything in this imagined little world they have created. The park is open, and yes, the park is awesome, but I think it will take some consideration to fully endorse it.Maybe the long wait raised my expectations up to the sky, maybe this is why I'm a little disappointed... but the one thing I'm sure of, It's that Jurassic World doesn't get anywhere near to the level of Spielberg's original... long live Jurassic Park.",Jurassic World

The modern special effects and over-use of the original movie's soundtrack are the only things that even remotely appealed to me (and probably anyone else who actually tried to make any sense of the script) -and even those aspects of the movie are lacking. I'd throw it in the same pile as Jurrasic Park III.

991,dehickey,Dinosaur Eye Candy and not much else.,6,16 June 2015,"I won't go into my love for Jurassic Park, my hatred of Jurassic Park 2 or my brainless enjoyment of Jurassic Park 3.Basically Jurassic World gives us a lot of dinosaur fun but seems to forget what made the original so special- character.The fact that I saw the movie last night and the only ""character"" name I remember is ""Blue"" is very telling. Basically, you have ""The Chick"", ""The Dude"", ""The Creepy Older Kid"" and ""The Creepy Younger Kid"" as characters in the film.The Dude and The Chick are the classic cliché of a couple that hates each other to start and ends up liking each other at the end. No surprises, and not a whole lot of interesting development there although there is still more romance in the relationship between the two than in the whole of the Twilight series.As for the kids- man I don't know what the director was thinking with the older kid and all the creepy brooding and starting he was doing. We fail to understand why this teenager A) has a cute blond girlfriend who apparently loves him to begin with and B)if he was so sad about leaving her, why was he creeping on EVERY teenage girl that came into his eye-line? There are no character developing moments, no character at all really to be determined from the two kids, and we don't really care about them other than the fact that they do stupid things that move the ""plot"" along. The younger kid is apparently ""special""? I don't know if it is a savant-type thing or what and it's never explained. He cries once speculating that their parents- who we don't care about- are getting divorced. The older kid has one speech on brotherly love that doesn't really make sense and by that point we could care less about either of them. Lex and Tim they are NOT.The funniest moments in the movie are the simply honest ones: once where Control Room Geek #1 goes to kiss Control Room Geek #2 and she tells him she has a boyfriend and that she didn't talk about him because, you know, WORK.The second honest moment comes at the end with a moment of mutual ""ok, I'm too tired to get into a pissing contest with you so... peace?"" between T-Rex and our favorite Raptor, Blue. Respect yo.Gomer Pyle plays the evil ""lets weaponize these animals, nothing could go wrong!"" guy with about as much energy as old Vinnie looks like he can muster these days with that serious spare tire around his waist.No, the most developed relationship in the movie is between The Dude (and I just looked it up, Pratt's character's name is Owen evidently) and the four raptors: Charlie, Echo, Delta and Blue. It's not chummy as the raptors would just as soon eat Owen as look at him, but it's a relationship built out of respect. Kind of like a trainer and a tiger I suppose. He never once forgets or does not respect how dangerous these creatures are.So yeah, things go to pot and dinosaurs eat people, yada yada yada. Next time, find a director that can actually make his characters a little more fleshed out and these movies can always be a fun ride.",Jurassic World

The action sequences are nice and keep you at the edge of your seat!But, and this is a big one. The movie also tries to be character driven one. And I have to say that the children were way sub par. They have long scenes, blank stairs, and no coherence. The movie builds up over and over again, but whenever the two kids are on screen, it falls short, and takes you out of the hole experience. Very bad acting :(. If the studio would have gone the direction of not so famous kids, that could actually act I think it could have been a great movie.",Jurassic World

The CGI dinosaur is thrilling and some scenes are downright scary when it appears on screen. The narrative builds up pretty well to set the dinosaur up as the ""villain out on rampage"".

Less focus on other species of dinosaurs. The park needed new thing every year as said in movie so as this movie also needed new things than other parts.

The trailer looked quite cool, though. The lack of proper acting and writing is astonishing. You do not expect Hamlet performance from the actors, but at least some level of involvement and the feeling that you care for the characters. If it was up to me, I would have let dinos to tear them apart piece by piece because of their acting. You know what is going to happen most of the time, so no surprises there. There are some scenes that make you want to punch somebody - when the lead actress in high heels! is running away from good old T-Rex..and she succeeded! The boys are terrible and the whole idea of broken family-put together again-by defeating the dinosaurs is just silly. Pros of the movie are FX which are very good and if you are seeing the movie in Imax or something similar the visual experience makes up for the weak points. If you like your eyes and visual center of the brain to be raped by dinosaurs rampaging through the theme park and you enjoy this on the big screen with bunch of other people, go see this movie.

Owen played by Chris has his four trained dinosaur and is called upon Jurassic to examine a new genetically modified dinosaur.The movie follows a simple plot and the acting was rather less impressive. Over the whole course of the movie I ended feeling very little for the characters portrayed. Good part, starting with graphics which are in abundance and the sound quality.

999,thefoxxx,Jurassic World review (spoilers),9,21 June 2015,"Being a huge fan of Jurassic Park and the novels, I was excited and had high hopes for this movie. Did it exceed my expectations? Yes, it did. Jurassic World is probably the better, if not best sequel to Jurassic Park than The Lost World or Jurassic Park 3 is. Picking up 22 years after the first film, Jurassic World brings John Hammond's dream to life with a fully functioning dinosaur theme park open to the public since 2005. The plot of the film is that a hybrid dinosaur called Indominous Rex is created in order to bring the park ratings back up. The I-rex gets loose and starts killing everything for sport. It is basically the same plot as the first film, but with a new story and characters. I liked that, I liked how original and faithful they stayed to the first film. Yes, there are references to the first film. There is a scene where these two kids end up in the old visitors center from the first movie. And yes, the original T-rex is back. The raptors are back also, but not as an enemy this time. Anyone who hasn't seen this should go see it. Don't go into it thinking that it's going to be better than the first, because it's not. Nothing will top the first movie, but this is an excellent sequel and a great time.",Jurassic World

Check. Bad guys looking to exploit dinosaur research? Check. Obvious plot as to how dinosaurs are more intelligent than expected? Check. OTT action that is beyond the scope of physical possibility? Check. Actors always being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but able to ""somehow"" get through it? Check.This was terrible. Shyte in fact. This says far too much about the state of the audience than I'd care to speculate on if they're enjoying this.

Everything from a horrible script to a complete retread of a music - everything is awful. For Hollywood this defines the cronyism and the current lack of creativity.

And somewhat positive critical reviews? have they all been bought? The movie is a non-stop orgy of clichés.

With all the cutting edge effects, teams of VFX & SFX gurus's, somehow JW just doesn't manage to muster a single set piece that incites fear, panic & sweat like the original. To watch this, is to really understand what a director like Spielberg truly commands. A single cohesive vision. I could complain about the characters, the plot, the poorly textured dinosaurs, but it would be completely fruitless. You'll all watch it anyway. The film discerning public will all leave with a taste of 'meh' in their mouths.

I was not so fond of 'Jurassic Park III' because I simply think the animation was poor. But now it is 14 years ago, so the animation has indeed improved since thenThe plot of the film is very simple, one Indominus Rex breaks out of its enclosure and are now at lose in Jurassic World, where there are about 20,000 guests. The dinosaur must be stopped before it eats all the guests and the rest of the dinosaurs in Jurassic World.I was VERY skeptical about especially one element in the film. The whole raptors-has- been-""trained""-by-man thing. One thing was communicating with the raptors in 'Jurassic Park III' through a model of a bone that is in the raptors skull as Dr. Alan Grant took advantage of. I had it a little mixed with, but you can train them to follow orders and do ""tricks"" that is another story. It was not as it appeared in the trailer, which I am incredibly relieved.The animation was really nice and I had several times during the film this wauw sense of how magnificent it all was and how exciting it was. They had used the original soundtrack from the first film, which of course gave great sense of nostalgia, and in addition there are small hints to the previous film here and there. There was more action scenes where there was Dino-fight and tension.If I have to describe the film in one word, it's a huge WAUW, I was mega entertained and maybe I'm a little biased since I have a serious obsession with dinosaurs, but the whole experience gave me just want to clap my small handsIt is not often that I just think I-want-to-go-and-watch-it-in-the-cinema-again"", but I feel that way with 'Jurassic World'5 stars should 'Jurassic World' garden when I really got grown my Dino obsession and the film is an incredibly successful for the 4th movie in the 'Jurassic Park' series",Jurassic World
1007,archaon_91,Jurassic Park > Jurassic World > The Lost World > JP3,7,11 June 2015,"In my opinion this movie neither sucks or can be praised as a blockbuster. It's just there and the joy of the movie is in the eye of the beholder. Let me explain: As a monster movie (comparing to King Kong, Godzilla,...) this movie actually looks great and is well worth your time. The action's there, the chemistry between the characters is there, you got a nasty looking Frankenstein of a dinosaur, the scenery is breathtaking and Chris Pratt does more than a decent acting job.However, if you're looking for a good story that makes sense and equals the magic of the original film, them i am afraid that this movie won't float your boat. There are just too many flaws in the story plot and many ridiculous script choices, like for example turning the Velociraptor into pets. And yes it does sound as silly as ""Alien: Resurrecttion"" where they want to turn one of the most feared monsters in human history into a trained pet that obeys commands like a good dog... No matter how they explain it in the movie (with mutual respect for each other), it's still a silly plot choice in the script. Not to mention a genetically modified dinosaur that hunts for sport instead of food, Predator flash-back anyone? My advice: don't put up your expectations too high and just watch it as the first class monster movie that this is, instead of failing to find the magic of the original film in it.",Jurassic World
1008,fruitsaverer,"Manages to somewhat return the Jurassic Park series to it's former glory, but its still a few notches below Spielberg's first two entries in the series.",6,4 June 2015,"Modernized and polished entry to the Jurassic Park series picks up 22 years after the original Steven Spielberg SyFy thriller with a fully functional prehistoric amusement park that is trying to pick up their attendance numbers by splicing the DNA of their animals in order to create a new attraction to bring in more customers. With this, they manage to create a dinosaur that is much bigger that the signature T-Rex but also much more aggressive, much smarter and much more territorial as well. So of course it does not take much time for this thing to break out of it's habitat to cause death and destruction in it's wake. It's then up to park consultant Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and company to stop this mega dinosaur from killing everyone on the island.While the set up is predictable as well as it's outcome, the movie still provides a fun two hours of distraction. The problem is however is that outside of Chris Pratt, whose playing an intelligent variation of his swagger character from "" Guardians"" No one in this movie is very interesting or likable with the slight exception of Vincent D'Onofrio, who can read a phone book and make it interesting. The script is cringe worthy in a lot of places and while technology has come very far from the original, good storytelling is far and few between. ""Jurassic World"" still does manage to offer a lot of scary moments of sheer terror and does provide some comic relief, which is a huge step up from the last movie of the series(Jurassic Park 3)but does not have the genuine spectacle and heart that drove Steven Spielberg's first two movies in the series (The original Jurassic Park and The Lost World : Jurassic Park).All and all, it's a decent ride that somewhat redeems the Jurassic Park series but they need shoot higher next time other than just be a decent follow up.",Jurassic World
1009,RogueKnite,"Jurassic World ""Rant-View:"" Or How ""Blue the Velociraptor"" is the love interest Christ Pratt deserves",3,16 September 2017,"When talking to friends and family about this film I always referred to it as Jurassic Park, because it always looked like a facsimile of the 1993 film. It seemed like they took every touch point from the 1993 film & copied it over to Jurassic World. One of the first shots in JW is that of a complete flyover of the park from the famous Jurassic Park gates, accompanied by the legendary John Williams' theme swelling in the background. In the 1993 film, this was a stirring moment, we were entering the park for the first time, we had no clue as to what was behind those gates, or the chaos those gates were holding back. The gates symbolizing the latch on Pandora's Box. In JW, we get the EXACT SHOT with identical musical cues. Yet the scene has no more than 1/10 of the impact it did in 1993. We know what's going to happen in JW, the awe is gone.The only facet of JW that improves on JP is the special effects. The visual effects and sets are impressive. The dinosaurs & the actual Jurassic World park look spectacular! At this point, you're probably wondering ""What else matters?!"" Well a lot actually. Especially when all of your human characters are less fleshed out than the dinosaurs. One of the many elements that made JP such a classic was its human characters. Each character was developed & felt like a three dimensional person. Even side characters, Samuel Jackson's technician & Wayne Knight's two-bit villain all have character motivations that make their character choices understandable.In JW not one human character is developed in any meaningful way. Our main hero, Pratt's Owen, is a former Navy Seal & a now dinosaur trainer (these scenes would be ""side-splitting"" hilarious if it weren't for the dialogue), period. That's it. We know nothing else about him. Other than him & our heroine, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), went on an ill-fated first date. When all hell breaks loose in Jurassic World, Claire goes to Owen to save her nephews solely because he's been designated ""hero man"" by the film's script.Let's now segue into JW's child characters, Zach & Gray. Zach & Gray are Claire's nephews. Zach is generic teenager #3 & Grey is generic kid who loves dinosaurs. These two serve no purpose other than being a reason for Owen and Claire to venture into Jurassic World. Every scene these two characters share makes absolutely no sense. They're there to be our virgin eyes into Jurassic World, showing us the park for the first time. Except we've been here before. Jurassic Park already explored the splendors of the dinosaur theme park. It's the equivalent of a friend telling you about the first season of your favorite TV show, which you've watched all 10 seasons of and know the dialogue inside & out. You're essentially being forced to consume something you've already digested.To say the script is garbage would be generous. The most worthy belongs to Vincent D'Onofrio's Vic wanting to use the Velociraptors as modern infantry. Claiming Velociraptors can't be bartered, hacked, or deterred in their pursuit of their prey. Hence, they are the perfect soldier. Pratt's Owen argues with Vic numerous times over this until the story calls for the (in)famous ""Pratt riding a motorcycle with a pack of Velociraptors"" shot, then Pratt's character does a complete 180° on the issue, which ultimately fails. I'd go into more detail, but that's spoiler territory.The best characters of JW are the dinosaurs. Not only because you have empathy for them, but because they are the only characters that are fun. Pratt's four Velociraptors are fun because they each have a name & distinct character traits. ""Blue,"" the leader, & the others follow her lead. Blue plays a critical role in the whole film, especially the climax. Pratt & Blue have more chemistry than any other two character in the film. It can be argued Blue is Pratt's true love interest, in lieu of Claire.But what are our heroes, unless they have a worthy foe? The ""big bad"" of JW is Indominus Rex, the first intentionally homicidal animal in a modern blockbuster. You could look at Indominus as the dinosaur version of Jason Voorhees. Indominus kills anything in its path simply because it's ""bad."" Another baffling decision made by the script. Indominus is eventually taken down by Pratt & his gang of misfits. The climax (one of the few bright spots of the film) is so over-the-top, it will be nearly impossible for the inevitable sequel to top.To call this film flawed is kind. I love cheesy movies. I love bad movies. There's a charm to something that goes so hilariously ""off-the-rails."" Yet Jurassic World is not an example of this. Halfway through Jurassic World's 124 minute runtime, I was pretty sure I lost my mind. At numerous points, I could not believe what I was watching was actually greenlit by a multi-billion dollar corporation. Never mind the record breaking box office and audience acclaim it's garnering. If you're still reading this (bless you!) I implore you not to see this movie. I don't even mean at the movie theater, but in general. Go watch Jurassic Park if you're inclined to see Jurassic World. Seen Jurassic Park already? Watch it again! There's nothing Jurassic World can give you that an umpteenth viewing of Jurassic Park can't.",Jurassic World

I have read several of the reviews here and most of the negative ones express disappointment. I would like to hear what they think would make Jurassic World the kind of movie they would love. There are only so many ways to peel a grape. I waited until the movie came out on video; Had I paid the high price of a movie ticket, that would have raised expectations beyond what the movie should be, namely entertainment. That's all movies like this are-- entertainment--and to poke at the plot and the characters as if they are calling on their best Siskel & Ebert is a joke. Some of the highest grossing movies got mediocre reviews. No wonder, because their job is to view movies as art. Having said all this, I enjoyed Jurassic World for what it was.

The theater was sold out, I was by myself, and I viewed the movie in its entirety. As a fan of the Science Fiction Genre, Dinosaurs (both science and mystery of the extinct creatures), and the ""Jurassic Park"" Franchise, I was happy to see another addition to the series. I enjoy movies in 3D and Large Format screens too. I would like to have viewed the movie in an IMAX 3D setting; although, this is a review of ""Jurassic World"" I feel it is important to me to view highly anticipated, new release films in these type of formats. I have no doubt that it is worth the extra fee and part of the modern era movie experience as these films are intended to be viewed in these formats as well. ""Jurassic World"" is mostly awe inspiring but violent. It is not grotesque it is not sickening, if gore is a motive... I do not enjoy gore. There is a lot of blood, bloody meat, flesh eating and flesh tearing. Dinosaurs do have sharp claws and teeth, they also eat other creatures. If you would like to see dinosaurs but do not like to see violence of this nature, my mother still closes her eyes when she is scared or looks away if she feels the moment is too much for her. Most Americans are de-sensitized to violence, children were present and they didn't seem fazed. The plot worked, I'm not sure how much thought was put into it but I liked it. I felt like a tourist with VIP access into the events. The actors executed the script well, I liked the characters. The effects were flawless, CGI was flawless (dinosaurs were beautiful), set and environment... flawless. ""Jurassic World"" delivered. I am a fan, I do not pretend to be an expert reviewer. I enjoy action/adventure and Sci-Fi films. Some people don't enjoy movies in which they did not write, direct, or star. Some people have qualms with violence, main-stream media, Hollywood, capitalism, all things free and fun.

1014,garalogias,Dinosaurs Rule the World,9,25 August 2015,"I am a hardcore fan of this saga. Enough said on that.So a fan always expects something mind-blowing and before I saw this movie everyone was complaining about the genetic modify hybrid dinosaur and why Collin dare not make the dinos important to the film?As in every movie that impacts audience - As Jurassic Park did back in the day -, news like this burns Troy to the ground.But really. What do the audience expect for a sci-fi movie of genetic modify animals that where long gone?I think today, we, as moviegoers, live in a nostalgic era. Where ""how you dare do this?! You have no right!"" are the mantra and ""you need to do this in order to work. Got it?"".It's true that moviegoers had influence the producers in order to change somethings for the sake of a good flick, whatever that is. But moviegoers are not producers and the majority of them doesn't know nothing of making a movie and storytelling. They just want more of the same, mostly for nostalgic reasons. Nothing more.And that's exactly what this movie talks about.It touches nostalgic strings but at the same time, it gives them what they want: more rampage, more kills, more, more more...And whats more of that? A dino that has it all! And while we are dealing whit sci-fi genetics. Why not make an intelligent hybrid dinosaur with different parts of animals (dinos and actual living creatures)?Few people know that Jurassic Park was believe to be a big flop. No one gave a penny for its success, not to mention the Dino-Mania that followed.But this is no the first time that JP touches a genetic modify dinosaur. In The Lost World book it has something of that. So no crime there, is just... something new in the theater.But the movie is not perfect, is cheesy at times, with clichè characters and predictable outcomes.But is not the clichè that bother me. Is the acting. the way each actor developed their character. Because - and this is just to make a point - in the original film each character are clichè versions of other versions. Just felt new at the time for a plot that had never being treat it like that before and because the script made very good job in introducing the audience to this world.But... What kind of characters this kind of movie needs?. Well everyone is entitled of their opinion, but the truth is in an adventure movie of this sort the characters that we saw in this film are the same ones we saw in Indiana Jones, Back to the Future. Perhaps better acted than in this one. But the same structure non the less.For me the worst performance in this film is the brother of Gray (Ty Simpkins), Zach (Nick Robinson). This is a character (and actor) that need it to be as much pain in the ass as possible. As in the-worst-brother/human being ever. He feels like a soap opera actor.Now, Is it really this movie that predictable? We already know that something will go wrong, we bought the idea that that's who it's going to turn out. We our not going to see this intricate subversive plot about why life needs to find a way to show us that life cannot be contained.It touches those themes in the same way as the original, but that's what bothers many people. They compare this movie with the original. They're not. And that's how it supposed to be.True this movie could've being more nostalgic than it is - or tries to be (I don't think is the case) - it points out a new point of view. The way on who humans deals with nature now a days and that's a new take on this saga.The movie take us in to the idea that people think they're just creatures but in reality they feel and scent. And that's why the insanity of the I Rex shines with all his glory. Is no just a monster movie just to be that. It has arguments to sustain that.In regards of the SFX, true they don't like the original dinos in JP, the look more... CGI-ish, and there's almost no practical effects. Is it?I've seen really talented guys that somehow their talent shined while the making of this film, and others that didn't but talented non the less; and I'm sure that their gifts could've made this movie more good looking in regards of the SFX than it is.It' really is that bad?I don't thinks so.True some times doesn't look as realistic as their predecessors (in most cases), but they're decent enough to buy that they're living breathing creatures.The Score is excellent but the editing of this movie felt as if this to departments (music and editing) never met, while there're good moments between this two, there're bad ones, like in the very end of the movie, when we see the island and the we see the Rex climbing through the helicopter tower to reclaim her throne. That transition (from the island and the heli-tower felt abrupt in such a manner that made me think the music was cut with no regards of the impact.As a sci-fi adventure movie, sure thing you will have a fun time and a nice ride and I guarantee it you will see it again.As a hardcore fan, well... depends on how you define ""fan"", if you don't take this too seriously, then you will love it.",Jurassic World
1015,prathikg2002,Excellent Cinematic work but fails to make a point - warning spoilers included,7,12 June 2015,"So here's my review for IMDb. warning spoilers included....... First off, hats off to the movie makers , found extreme cinematic action overall in all parts of the movie , isn't easy to make a movie of magnitude, undoubtedly the most epic movie of this age. What audience look at in a movie series is that one special character or something evidently new which this movie has fulfilled, could have been more intense with some rain and darkness and some visual thrills and more twists, but none the less like the part one this one -also has got its attention. Doesn't give the audience any thrill, we wanted it !!except for one scene where the Dino comes running towards the cam to eat up the person in front. The Indian role almost seems non existent or lacks the aura of a special character . Could be his dialogs or the tone of dialog delivery either way fails to make a point . Parts where Dino is playing hide and seek all the time when the humans are hiding gets boring after sometime -looks like a scene repeat .. I was amazed at the life like quality of the visual effects and the concept of biological modification on dinosaurs. Make you think they are all the more powerful and you don't know what's next. No loose ends and less crap make this movie a complete hit . I would rate this 7 out of 10 for the excellent cinematic work.",Jurassic World

I Can totally see a confident team who is already waiting to cash their success since their 'cool' CGI are sorted, futuristic sets, and sharp haircut for the main lead.Its like audience is trying to hard to like the movie, for their love of franchise, but these jokers are still holding on to their CGI trance and think its 'enough'. Lame bad timed puns, hardly scared blank faced kids, doing small talk while a huge monster is chasing them, standard 'bad boy' military angle , a know-it-all muscle hero and check box ticking -forced romanceThe collapse of this plot is so poorly planned and actors have done a horrible job to make us feel the terror and take this 'fiction' even remotely serious apart from 'convenient science for all ' feel of an i-phone looking lab.

I personally found the dinosaurs had far more personality than any of the characters. Why can't Hollywood spend just a little more on hiring decent writers who can build believable, rounded characters and original scenarios? The actors did a fair job with the material they'd been dumped with but none of them could raise their characters above cliché.Once the monsters get going it's a good romp with great special effects and that is the saving grace of an otherwise very badly written movie.",Jurassic World

Very Disappointed. **Spoiler Alert**,2,1 July 2015,"**Just a warning that this will completely ruin and spoil the movie if you haven't seen it yet**I don't even know where to begin. Overall, I felt nothing lined up right or made much sense. For example the scene when Gray and Zach were on the train, Gray starts crying because he found out their parents are getting divorced. Ummmm what does that have to do with anything?! Completely unnecessary waste of time and adds nothing to the main idea of the movie. Throughout the entire film, I felt nothing but frustration and disappointment. Every character, except for Owen, was a complete moron, especially Claire who took forever to gain a sense of morality to take proper action against the Indomnius Rex. All she had was a selfish profit oriented mindset of wanting to save it rather than protecting the people. So what do they do!? They run at it like a bunch of morons with lousy TASERS. Are you serious!? If I recall correctly, they took down the T-Rex's in Jurassic Park 3 with a single tranquilizer dart. Why didn't they do that here?! Idk maybe it would have been too easy that way.Then finally nearing the end of the movie when all else fails, they bring out the T-Rex. I'm thinking ""YES!!! I didn't even think about that. This is going to be awesome!!! A little redemption for the T-Rex after losing a 1v1 against the Spinosaurus in Jurassic Park 3."" and it kinda was cool, but only to be disappointed again with complete randomness of the Mosasaur jumping out of the water to finish the job, grabbing the Indomnius. Really!? You're just gonna end it like that huh? No pride or dominance for the T-Rex? No victorious roar or anything like that? Such a disappointment....These are just a few example of what I'm talking about. I could list more, but you get my point. And while I didn't like this movie, I could easily see the younger audience loving this movie. Big dinosaurs, lots of loud action filled scenes, I can see this being cool for the younger kids, but it takes more than just action and suspense filled scenes to do it for me. It needs to make sense.I'd also like to ask, how did Claire manage to wear those high heels throughout the entire movie? lol that had to suck",Jurassic World
1020,joe-garwood,One Damn Corny Waste of my Time,4,14 June 2015,"So the park is open. The only problem is, in the first 10 minutes of this film i already wanted the park to close. Jurassic World is a film that i knew was pretty bad as soon as it began. The opening scene is cheesy enough to put you off the rest and make you want to leave the cinema. However, I stayed and decided to watch the rest of it. By about half of the way through the movie, I came to the conclusion that there were a lot of problems with it, but there was one main problem that really brought the movie down. The performances. There was no chemistry between any of these characters. Every conversation felt forced and bland. There was only one performance in the movie that i felt redeemed the movies acting credits, and that was the performance of Jake Johnson, but his character was far too small to make a large affect on the movie. Another problem with Jurassic World was the vast amount of useless, pointless plot points that did nothing to the movie. For example, there is a scene where Gray, the youngest of the two main brothers in the film, starts to get upset and we find out that his parents are getting divorced. This is the only time the divorce and struggling marriage of the parents is mentioned and does absolutely nothing to the plot. This film was far too predictable. Every time you met a new character, you could tell whether they were going to survive or not. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this movie was Chris Pratt. I went into the movie thinking that Chris Pratt was going to be the saviour in average movie, but his performance just made a poor movie even poorer with terribly delivered lines and failing to convince us that he was the guy we all wanted to be. Having said that, Jurassic World wasn't bad enough to make me want to kill myself. The graphic effects were fairly impressive and there were a few genuine thrills, but they were all seen in either the trailer or featurettes and clips, so didn't shock or thrill a lot of viewers as much as they could have. All in all, I went into Jurassic World expecting an OK, but entertaining action flick, but i got a cliché 21st century action movie with poor performances and a extreme amount of predictability. 5.4/10",Jurassic World
1021,amypjs2,"It's a movie about dinosaurs, what else would you expect??",9,15 June 2015,"Everyone is saying that this movie is totally predictable and I'm just sitting here like well duh, it's a movie about dinosaurs. But what else do you need? Flying saucers and Cowboys? No. Chris Pratt made an excellent raptor trainer dude and I'm excited to see him in more of the Jurassic World series. Jurassic world brought back a nostalgia factor that I wasn't expecting and it was such a great experience.Sit back, have some popcorn and stop being so picky about movies. They're here for entertainment purposes and nothing else. If you weren't entertained by this movie then i think you should go take a chill pill. I 10/10 recommend seeing this movie if you enjoyed the previous Jurassic park movies and if you like dinosaurs in general...oh and obviously watching people get eaten by dinosaurs is also fun am I right?",Jurassic World
1022,darth-godwin,Predictable,1,22 November 2015,"I watched this on an airline flight. After 30 minutes I fell asleep. On the return flight I forced myself to watch the rest. Within 40 minutes of the start of the film I knew who was going to die and who wasn't, how the story was going to resolve (if you can call it that) and the fact that I didn't care about ANY of the characters. I also couldn't name a single one of them. There was more character development in the Flintstones. People did the same stupid things that NO ONE would actually do in real life (yelling when there's a big killer dinosaur looking for them, standing up on high ground etc.) The story was so thin it was probably written on a cocktail napkin. Special effects guys did the usual amazing job, and Pratt tried REALLY hard, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I was grateful when the turbulence hit my plane and the pilot interrupted it. I cannot believe that this utter pile of garbage took in a billion dollars. Please...no more sequels, take the billion and use it for some good, instead of torturing people.",Jurassic World

If this is your fist movie in the series then you will be confused and amazed in the same time. The CGI in the movie is beautiful, it gives life to dinosaurs...I don't say that animatronics aren't good, I just response to the haters of CGI. Im just a little disappointed from the species part, I mean that I was waiting to see the dinosaurs that are rendered to site. It was a good chance to expand the park. Anyway, I respect and support the hybrid idea, it is good to bring new stuff in these movies like the aquatic dinos",Jurassic World
1025,tristan6252,A Good Film - But Small Improvements Were Needed!,8,10 July 2015,"Jurassic World was great at some parts, but some were just not needed whatsoever. For a start the story completely ignores Lost World and Jurassic Park 3, which is good, every film deserves a change in ideas, but in my opinion it would of been great to stick to the third and Lost World, but that being said in my opinion Jurassic World is a big improvement and is a lot better than any other Jurassic Park movie. So here is one downside in the movie, they kept forcing family issues and romance that is not needed whatsoever in a Jurassic type film, it's all about the dinosaurs, that's what people came to see. That being said the film was very cleverly done, with big improvements in special effects and the personalities of the characters as well compared to Jurassic Park 3, at least. The acting was very well done as well, and most characters had good stories behind them and their emotions in the film was perfect. One last thing to add is Chris Pratt did an amazing job in the film, and probably one of the main reasons to see the movie in the first place.Overall: The Film was good, and I believe it's worth seeing, enjoy the film :)",Jurassic World
1026,theresistancerises,A film that recaptures the magic of the original and brings us back to the park,9,9 June 2015,"The park is finally open. Ever since ""Jurassic Park III"" was released in 2001, rumors of a fourth film have been circulating the Internet for years and we've been waiting for a long time to see a continuation of this beloved franchise. And now, with the help of director Colin Trevorrow, we finally get to go back to Isla Nublar to see living, breathing dinosaurs again. I can say with full confidence that ""Jurassic World"" is the first true sequel to ""Jurassic Park"". This is, by far, the best sequel in the franchise and is worthy of being a continuation of the ""Jurassic Park"" story. Everything you want from a ""Jurassic Park"" film is here: a sense of awe and wonder, suspense and terror, likable characters, an infectious score, and jaw-dropping dinosaur action""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star Chris Pratt continues to be an extremely charming and charismatic leading man, giving the audience a character that we can easily relate to. While Sam Neill was a great leading man for the first ""Jurassic Park"" films, Chris Pratt brings something different to the table with Owen Grady and is, for once, directly involved in the action. Unlike most other ""Jurassic Park"" leads, he is able to fight with or against the dinosaurs roaming in the park. While the other characters in the previous films did fight back at times, they were simply survivors and not heroes. We now finally have a hero in the ""Jurassic Park"" series and it was a very interesting change of pace as Pratt's portrayal of Grady mixes the best elements of action heroes into one collective body: charming and witty, intelligent, and, most of all, heroic.But if there was one actor people will be talking about after seeing this film, it would probably be Bryce Dallas Howard. The energy she brings to Claire Dearing was just great, making what could have been a one-note character into a more fleshed out human being. What Trevorrow intended for these characters, especially for Howard's, was to deconstruct and change these archetypes that we see so often in other films of the same genre. Dearing's evolution and progression in the film was handled smoothly with clever writing and direction. Besides Dr. Ellie Sattler in the first ""Jurassic Park"" film, there were not many interesting female characters in the franchise and now I'm very happy to see Bryce Dallas Howard showing off what she could bring to the series. Her beauty is infectious charming and her strength as a character makes us cheer. Howard, you were great and I hope you get some more recognition from this film (and hopefully people will stop confusing you for Jessica Chastain).If you think the trailers for ""Jurassic World"" spoiled all the best bits for you, trust me, it doesn't. There are so many more jaw-dropping, cheer worthy moments in the film that I just cannot spoil for you here. The action is relentless. Like the first ""Jurassic Park"" film, it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time and is shot with confidence and respect. In an age where quick cuts and shaky cam is popular, ""Jurassic World"" feels like an explosion, hearkening back to what Spielberg did in the 90's. The dino-action is handled beautifully and the last third of this film is one glorious, giant action set piece. The new dinosaur, the Indominus rex, is simply a badass. The promotional footage spoils almost nothing about the creature's badassery. It's something that you truly have to experience in the theater. But not only is the action beautifully executed and thrilling to watch, it is also evenly paced. It never feels too long or too tiring. The action is spliced into the story without sacrificing characters and plot.Now, my one and only complaint I have with ""Jurassic World"" would definitely be the reliance on CGI effects seen in the film. The tradition of merging animatronics and state-of- the-art computer generated dinosaurs has been kept throughout the ""Jurassic Park"" series and ""Jurassic World"" is no different, however there definitely isn't enough practical effects present in the film. This doesn't hurt the film per say, but aesthetically it would've been more realistic and more convincing if they used mechanical puppets for the close-ups of the dinosaurs. There is one scene where an animatronic puppet is used to great effect and I wished more of the film was like that. But, with that in mind, the CG on these dinosaurs is pretty great. It's not as good as ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", but it is definitely convincing enough. This is a mostly personal preference, but this nitpick is in no way distracting or jarring. I do understand why the creators opted to use CGI, but I would've liked to see more puppeteering in the film.Overall, ""Jurassic World"" is an extremely entertaining, suspenseful, dinosaur filled adventure ride that needs to be experienced in the theater. It is a visually beautiful looking film and recaptures the magic that Spielberg brought to use over 20 years ago. ""Jurassic Park"" is one of the most important films of my life and seeing this new film put tears to my eyes. This film was like a collection of my dreams put together into one amazing entity. Ever since I was a child, I've always loved dinosaurs and I still do. So these films fill me with so much joy and inspiration. It's just astounding. This is definitely a biased review but I gotta give it a 9.5 out of 10. I was definitely the only person in the theater crying but I couldn't help it. It was beautiful.",Jurassic World
1027,jdhatefi,A Faithful Blast of the Past!!,8,14 June 2015,"One of my most anticipated films in quite some time, Colin Trevorrow's Jurassic World is finally out in theaters for mankind to embrace and boy is it a thrill ride. Starring Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Vincent D'Onofrio, Jurassic World revolves around an amusement park 22 years after the incidences of the first Jurassic Park. After sales start declining, the park decides to create a hybrid dinosaur to keep attendance soaring. But catastrophe strikes once they underestimate how intelligent it is. Chriss Pratt was a great pick for the lead but I felt as though I was watching an underdeveloped super hero as opposed to a more relatable character like Dr. Alan Grant. Whether the alpha little emotions sounds appealing or not, there's no doubt he's bad***.Even with the splendid cast, the main attraction, obviously, are the dinosaurs. As ironic but somewhat predictable as it may sound, I felt that the old animatronics looked better than the special effects seen in the newest rendition. However, the vast visual spectacles exceed the original in pretty much every other aspect.Jurassic World is marvelous but not phenomenal. It successfully satisfies the brain but not quite the heart. Nevertheless, this movie purposely aims for the chaos; not the emotion behind it. It is, in short, some seriously stupid mindless fun.",Jurassic World

Period. Let's go! Chris Pratt is great within his role. Again, he will not win an Oscar, but he delivers a performance that makes the audience care about the character and his intentions.Bryce Dallas Howard, BD Wong and Vincent D'Anafrio play predictable characters, but ones that are needed to make the story work and make it more entertaining.There are several meta references to the first film which makes Jurassic World feel self aware about it's place in cinematic and franchise history.While this movie is technically a sequel to Jurassic Park, it is better when viewed as a stand alone entry that focuses on the results a dinosaur theme park could have on the world, and not just a park.The movie promises to be fun and exciting while delivering action scenes featuring dinosaurs and peril.It succeeds.",Jurassic World
1029,pokeyallred,"an overall good film, but not as good as the first one",6,20 June 2015,"Jurassic World is by no means the best movie out of the Jurassic Park series, but it is still a mighty fine film when viewed by itself. of course Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard would never be able to do better than Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum in the original, but it is still better than it's predecessor Jurassic Park III, which takes place several decades after this one does.By no means is this a 10 star movie, mainly due to the fact that some of the things that they did in the movie were completely unbelievable at parts. Like when there are a bunch of flying dinosaurs coming and picking the people off, Owen and Claire decide to kiss. or at the climax of the film when the T-Rex is battling it out with the genetically modified dinosaur, and the character Claire is just watching, then begins to crawl away. why on earth would you not run away from these two giant monsters battling it out, why would anybody ever decide too just stand there, then start crawling? Prehaps the real mystery in the Jurassic Park universe is if there are literally four movies dedicated too how bad bringing people to an island filled with dinosaurs can be, so at what point do people finally decide to stop bringing their children to these islands?",Jurassic World

Cinematography - no, no, no. C'mon guys, you can do better? I was expecting great camera work, good views and angles, brighter colors. More scenes with crowd and more fights, blood. There was just one moment in the whole movie which made me say WOW. And I watched it on Imax.. Movie was long (2 hours), but it felt longer (3 hours). I could know what will happen in the middle or end already after watching first few minutes of the movie.

Overall each scene is predictable and you can almost foretell which all characters will make it through. I could even predict the climax before the first half of the movie!! There is a desperate attempt to garner nostalgia from old fans by bringing in characters from the Jurassic park movie(eg. T-Rex), i felt that the movie is a patch work of different Hollywood movies. If you watch closely you can clearly see the climax scene of 'how to train your dragon 2' and some parts from expendables franchise(just replace the actors with the dinosaurs, old action heroes returning in cameo), you will also get a feel of 'deep blue sea'. The tag team fight between the dinos in the last scene almost made me cry!! terrible.. even little kids in the theatre didn't feel the horror..",Jurassic World

The younger brother undergoes a sudden change in character that is confusing, and the subplot of the parents' divorce was not well developed. Also, the villain of the movie was a a bit too one-sided. As an audience member, I felt a bit insulted at the lack of subtlety of his character. Also, the aunt and general manager of the park had a sudden shift of her feeling toward her nephews. One moment, she is completely indifferent about their existence, and the next minute, she is willing to brave a jungle with a blood-thirsty dinosaur in order to save them.

I never would have thought that they would be making a Fourth one and when I heard they were making a new one I was ecstatic. It brought back all the memories of the first 3 films. When the day came for Jurassic World to open it had to go see it on opening day and I did. The movie gave us the same feeling Jurassic Park 1 did ""Welcome to Jurassic World"". The new park looked amazing showing that John Hammond'so dream finally came true. The music was more amazing than ever, the original Jurassic Park theme was re-prised to show how much thing had changed in 14 years. The main attraction of this movie was the Indominus Rex and hybrid of T-Rex, Raptor, cuddle fish, and Tree frog and terrifying intelligence.

Only the visual effects people seem to be doing a good job.Colin Trevorrow does not seem to be a very good director when it comes to directing actors, almost as bad as George Lucas. I think he's a hack. I didn't like his direction and his editorial choices in Safety Not Guaranteed either, huge chunks of that film should have been removed.The musical score of JW is very average and frequently lays on the syrup. I think it's partially a consequence of the very poor direction. The job of music is to score the actual emotion in the scene, due to the sub-par direction there is very little emotion in scenes, hence why the music is so jarring.And even the production design itself was a underwhelming. It did not feel like a significant place to visit.It seems to me that the most talented people these days are working in American TV, while cinema has the dregs and the ""former greats"" going through the motions for a big payday.",Jurassic World

It is a superficial movie which don't satisfy serious audiences. 2. Long introduction. You should wait a long time for the main story to start. 3. Lack of rationality. It doesn't seem rational that a center which has such a high technology to create hybrid dinosaurs, has nothing to face with this critical problem but a number of man and some automatic guns!

1041,zarinchowdhury,Adventures and Actions!,8,1 January 2018,"Jurassic World is American science fiction adventure film which was directed by Colin Trevorrow. This movie located in Costa Rica, the Jurassic World resort provides a habitat for a variety type of dinosaurs, including the very dangerous and intelligent hybrid dinosaur named Indominus Rex. In the movie, the hybrid dinosaur escapes from its cage which causes the other dinosaurs to avoid and create a violent disruption in the resort. It was up to the former military and animal expert Chris Pratt to use his unique skills to save the two young brothers and the rest of the tourists in the resort. I like how the movie has extreme close up looks and loud sounds which makes the film more fun to watch. For example- when the militaries went to the jungle to look for that Indominus Rex, they couldn't find that dinosaur at first because they didn't know that dinosaur can camouflage. When the Indominus Rex appeared in front of them, the camera was extremely close to that dinosaur's face. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The director Colin Trevorrow did an excellent job to create this film. He provided a unique plot, angles, sound, shots, lighting, etc. The actors did an outstanding job with their roles and contribution. Also, the director was successful to help the actors act their parts better. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy adventures and actions.",Jurassic World

1043,genebathurst,The franchise has had a lobotomy,4,30 March 2019,"Dinosaurs. Amusement Park. Tourists. Disaster.Jurassic World has them all.Naturally, I had to see it.The beginning holds much promise, and it gets your hopes up for the disaster to come. When it does, there are some great action sequences, especially ones with the glass ball containing the soft, chewy child centre.Unfortunately the final act unravels into outright farce.Chris Pratt is great as the affable yet bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's got an easy going charisma that could easily carry an iconic character like Indiana Jones.Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire Dearing, the uptight park manager, who initially clashes with the laid back Owen. Of course you know where the tension goes.The film tries to flesh out Claire's character by throwing in her two nephews (someone and another kid), who do double duty as McGuffins.Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as Hoskins, a villainous representative of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery chewing, so obviously evil he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it well but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.The director, Colin Trevorrow, said in interviews that he wanted the dinosaurs to act like real animals, not cartoon monsters. Quelle surprise! I had no idea, as he has well-fed winged dinos (or near enough to dinos) go on a crazed orgy of violence against hapless tourists. Why? Because cool action sequence!One poor soul is even treated to the most outlandishly elongated death sequence I've ever seen, all to no end. It didn't justify anything, paid nothing back, offered no comeuppance. It was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic torture of a minor character. It was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.Which brings us to the final act: turn off your brain before it begins.The first movie proved you could have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same movie. After that, the IQ of the series dropped with each outing. The first one had chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.What does this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a clunky plot, and characters so smart they run from T-Rex's in high heels.The franchise has had a lobotomy.",Jurassic World

Not only he has placed ""more teeth"" in the most aesthetic way, he has also kept the pace at an optimum level not to turn this into a chaos cinema, that has been ruling the screens for some time. You can't deny the influence of Steven Spielberg throughout, and there are references to ""Jaws"" and ""Indiana Jones"" as well, and of course to Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" post the aviary destruction sequence. There's nothing that can compare to ""Jurassic Park,"" but ""Jurassic World"" at least tries to match the heart and soul of the original. A lot of ""Jurassic World"" is just fine as there is some great dinosaur action (Velociraptors, T-Rex, Mosasaurus and Indominus Rex), and a spotlight on Bryce Dallas Howard's role as a strong feminine protagonist who spends most of the movie kicking ass without relying on men for help. Chris Pratt also does a great job of pulling the Sam Neill role, playing a bold new hero for the new direction the series takes. Jurassic World is as meticulously crafted as the strange, clean, efficient theme park that is the real central character of the movie, with a great 3D experience for the audience. And it is great to see our own Irrfan Khan performing like in such a sharp manner with all the powerful co-actors. Special mention is B.D Wong, the only actor retained from the original film. It is not easy to match up to the work of a team which consisted of Spielberg, Michael Crichton, Janusz Kaminski, Michael Kahn, Stan Winston, John Williams, David Koepp and others but the contemporary production team has done their best and Trevorrow delivers a great thrill ride.",Jurassic World
1045,praysnow2,Honest review by a regular moviegoer,10,12 June 2015,"I actually spent a lot of my time reading through many of the reviews for this movie after I saw it yesterday. Honestly, I am not sure if some people even know what they want in a movie anymore.Look, everyone has their own taste. But if you are a fan of the genre, a fan of the first three movies, or just a dinosaur fan at all, you will absolutely love this movie. Forget about all these reviewers that thumb their nose due to a ""lack of character development"" or that they needed more ""story"". Those lines are so overused and rarely ever applied correctly. Sometimes I read reviews and I'm not sure if I actually saw the same movie.I refuse to give away any of the movie. You should stop reading about Jurassic World and just go see it. The less you know the better it is.What I can tell you is that this movie is a bit more intense, more so than any of the other three. It is leaps and bounds better than JP3, much better than JP2, and in some ways, even better than the original (better special effects, much more action).The original will always hold a special place as it introduced us to the story, the genre, and set the bar for movie special effects. But I am telling you, this one beats it in some of those categories.10 out of 10. It does not get any better than this for dino lovers.",Jurassic World
1046,JDheart,Its a Jurassic World after all.,7,2 June 2015,"The 4th film in the Jurassic Park series and the second sequel that Steven Spielberg did not direct starts off well enough with enough call backs to the first film of the series but quickly turns into a monster movie with a run away super killer dinosaur that was spliced by the DNA of other prehistoric creatures for the sake of selling extra tickets. If my description of the plot Is pretty simplistic,it's because the story is that simple. So forget the dangers of science morality tales that both ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" gave to it's stories and just accept that the series has become a standard creature feature that just swaps out it's main monster for every new installment. The last film in the series ""Jurassic Park 3"" pretty much threw away the whole plot lines of the first two films just to give us a chase film with a dinosaur that was never even seen in ""The Lost World"" and that film was set on the same island. While ""Jurassic Park 3"" just went on a painful 90 minutes long montage of talking raptors, horrible scenes of family bonding and an visible annoyed Sam Neill looking like he's about to go postal on the people working on the film set, Jurassic World manages to be a hell of a lot more enjoyable experience for the viewer in terms of just trying to inject a sense of plot and continuity to this other wise creature feature.As a standard creature feature, the movie works well and gives you your money's worth of dinosaurs doing collateral damage to property and personnel with the occasional park visitor being killed for good measure. Throw in your slack jaw good guy ( Chris Pratt) who feels that the creatures are misunderstood and works with good guy dinosaurs(I Kidd you not) to help stop the super killer dinosaur. Throw in an human adversary for our hero to fight with ( Vincent D""Onofrio) who would blow the whole island up to get this monster and add an human element like two lost children who are related to a employee at this crazy theme park who by the way has the hots for our hero and you have the entire story right there.It's hard enough to keep a franchise going, especially when you're dealing with dinosaurs walking the earth. You will eventually hit a wall in terms of storytelling if your primary goal is to keep turning these films out with out any care what so ever. We saw that with ""Jurassic Park 3"" where all the plot points from the previous two films were abandon for a B Movie creature feature. ""Jurassic World"" tries hard to correct that by having the movie be about something a little more and try to connect itself to the first film of the series. And Its much better film for it but it still ends up a creature feature all the same.",Jurassic World
1047,suzanne-219,Enjoyable but don't think too hard,8,7 August 2016,"This was a very enjoyable movie that I watched at home, not in the theater. I saw the original ""Jurassic Park"" years ago in the movie theater when it came out. I don't really remember too much of it and haven't seen any of the sequels.The movie was a good horror/thrill ride. The first part has you waiting for the terrible things to happen, and it builds a lot of good suspense by slowly introducing all of the characters, and the dinosaurs, and it has plenty of foreshadowing as well.I thought they picked really great actors, especially Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio. Chris Pratt is always great, especially as the hero like he is here. The actors playing the kids and the other roles were also very good. It was fabulous to see BD Wong as well, playing another mad scientist like he does on ""Gotham."" They don't do a fantastic job building the characters, though, or giving us their motivation. I thought that Hoskins was particularly bad and hard to understand. It didn't make sense that he wanted to use the dinosaurs to fight, yet he didn't seem to understand how dangerous they were and seemed to think that he could control them as well as Owen. It made him seem like an idiot. A villain is much better if he's not stupid.All of the special effects were good, and the dinos seemed real. They had great action and chase scenes.I was really surprised when the T Rex showed up at the end out of nowhere. Did they mention it somewhere in the movie before that and I somehow missed it? I don't know. Maybe they just assume you saw the previous movies so you would suspect he was lurking around somewhere. To me it just seemed ridiculous that all of a sudden, Claire almost literally pulled this T Rex out of her back pocket and pointed it at the I Rex, and the T Rex just did what they wanted and then sauntered off without killing anyone or anything else. At least with the raptors attacking it, that made sense since they had a previous relationship with Owen.So the ending was a bit of a Deux Ex Machine. Unpredictable, sure, but laughable.When the monsters were fighting at the end, I was reminded of the old Godzilla movies I used to watch as a kid. I lived in an inner city, and the local rec center showed a lot of free movies during the summer. They showed us all of the old Godzilla movies, and I loved them. So, that was a highlight of this movie for me - the nostalgia.Seeing T Rex, though, I couldn't help but wonder how he could so easily beat up the other monster, with his tiny little Donald Trump-like hands. And T Rex is a meat eater, so why didn't it just eat the other monster dinosaur? Or was that too gruesome? I really liked the raptors and was upset when they were hurt or killed as well as the ankylosaurus.Another dumb thing was when the kids started the jeep on their own and drove off. I'm no car expert, but that seemed ridiculous. However, that whole scene where they find the whole Jurassic Park area was really cool, and I'm sure all fans loved that part as well as the many mentions of the older movies and their characters.I was a bit surprised that in the end, they never explained what would happen to the island or its dinosaurs. What happened to all of those winged dinosaurs (Pterodactyls or whatever)? Did they fly off to other parts of the world? Anyway, I enjoyed it, and I'm glad I watched it. I probably would have enjoyed it in the theater as well. It was worth my time.",Jurassic World

1049,deno111,Did Steven Spielberg loose his Mojo??,7,5 December 2015,"I watched this movie, and it doesn't hold a candle to Jurassic park (1993). Jurassic park was a magical experience, this is just another money making movie. And that's what bothers me the most. Why did Steven Spielberg settle for this kind of script anyway? Or he just doesn't care anymore. Sexy redhead running in high heels, afraid of the hybrid dinosaur, but not so much of T-rex, Velociraptors communicate with human So many absurdities are in this movie, that make it less plausible. Watching Spielbergs early movies, I see how much love and effort was invested to make movies real, from actors to effects. When the script is good, when the actors really do their best and with good special effects, you get a classic picture, that will stand the test of time. In this move only effects were good, acting was mediocre, and the script was poorly written. All in all the movie wasn't all that bad, but I expected a little more from Spielberg, especially when Jurassic park sequels weren't accepted as good as the first movie.",Jurassic World

Let's make a Jurassic Park sequel.. what do we need?... well the original was pretty good so lets just copy that but make it bigger and badder with more people and more dinosaurs..We need, some one that looks like Jeff Goldblum... hmmm... this Indian guy will do..We need a couple of kids.. yep, these two will do..We need a villain, yep the bad guy from Daredevil will do..etc etc...OK, now let's use the Jurassic park theme music...""OK.. OK.. CUT.. CUT!!!!!!!What the hell is going on here?!!Watch this movie in the right frame of mind, as it seems these days most people will swallow any load of crap..The music is so badly placed it feels cliché... the dialogue seems like it was written for the most dramatic effect and to get the ball rolling but felt really fake, everything that happened seemed predictable.. I come to no other conclusion other that this movie was made to rake in the cash.. nothing really original here.. no soul, another Hollywood piece of garbage..I'm sorry but if you really liked this movie then you need to get out more..It's such a shame that when making a movie that MUST be a blockbuster, everything that would make it a good movie is then stripped away.. Seems to be the same with most sequels these days.. I'm hopeful for the new Star Wars movie, but this, like so many others is naff..",Jurassic World
1051,Fordifyed,Painful. Had to pause it 10 times to recover from the cringe.,1,16 December 2016,"If you like clichés then you'll love this film. Or If you can also switch of all critical thought and logic then you might also enjoy this film.The dino graphics are average. The acting is average. The shreds of a plot are strung together with duct tape. Characters are two dimensional with literally no backstory. clichés everywhere. The plot is catered specifically for young kids it seems, especially considering the very G-rated death scenes. There is not a single original idea in the entire film. Minority races fill up every side role apart from our heroes who are all Caucasians. The film felt almost like a dino version of Spy Kids.The whole film is a sellout. I can just imagine the producers' meeting prior to filming: ""Guys, this film literally sells itself. All we have to do is take no risks and fill it with a winning formula and we'll make a billion dollars.""",Jurassic World

This is an exciting, awe inspiring and most of all a FUN film. I thought it was the closest film to the first in terms of exhilaration. It actually reminded me of the original a few times, which is a great honour. Finally, if there was one thing that annoyed me it was the product placement. I saw so many obvious plants that it started to be an overt ad for coke, mercedes, verizon, samsung and others. But then it made me think about what was going on in the park in the film. They too were having trouble with corporate sponsors. So maybe the product placement was a cute way of implying that all art or science is inevitably valued only by its monetary worth.",Jurassic World
1053,Skotsuyama,"My favorite Jurrasic Movie so far. Even better than the original, IMO.",9,9 June 2015,"I live in Taiwan, and for some reason, movie's always open a few days before the rest of the world.My wife and I just watched this movie in the theater, and it blew us away! Granted, we weren't really expecting that much in the first place. I was thinking it'd be along the lines of Jurassic Park 3, a non-sense, BS cash grab movie. But not at all! It clearly explained, why Jurassic World exists even after all the terrible mistakes of Jurassic Park. After 22 years, the public has pretty much forgotten everything, and they just want to be shocked and awed at HUGE dinosaurs.I don't want to explain the plot, because the trailers pretty much sum everything up. But I'll address my concerns going into the movie: 1) The boys.. The parents that just tell the boys at the airport, ""If anything chases you, just run!"" sarcastically. - They weren't nearly as bad as any of the previous children's characters in Jurassic Park movies. I was worried it was going to be a whole bunch of crying and screaming and near death experiences with dinos, only to be saved by some freak accident at the last possible second... And it's not nearly as bad as that. They served a purpose in the movie, and never left me shaking my head in disbelief.2) Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's on screen chemistry. There was one trailer that shows a clip of them talking by Chris Pratt's Bungalow. And in that clip, they seemed stiff and unnatural. - For whatever reason, in the actual movie, their chemistry was great! Even that scene played out super naturally.. So I don't know.. Maybe it was weird cut in the trailer, or taken too much out of context.. But yeah, they were both great in the movie! Chris Pratt is badass the entire movie. He killed it.The 2nd half of this movie, my jaw dropped, and stayed open. Even though you probably have a pretty good idea what's going to happen from the trailer, watching the ending was still a super shocker and surprise for me. So badass..Alright, I'm a terrible reviewer. Just wanted to say, if you're on the fence about this movie, go see it! It's totally worth your money!",Jurassic World
1054,MattTheNoble,"Good, Not Great (small spoilers)",7,14 June 2015,"Well, it's here, perhaps the summer's most anticipated sequel (the box office will tell us if Avengers should worry as estimates for this weekend continue to grow), Jurassic World. Picking up from Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, newcomer director Colin Trevorrow creates a new film and hopes to re-invigorate young and old alike on the dream that science can bring back the dinosaurs. Trevorrow has what can only be described as a dream story, going from the small, low budget, endearing flick Safety Not Guaranteed to a huge Spielberg production after doing very well at Sundance. Jurassic World is truly an achievement for such a quick turn around for someone with so little experience. The film itself feels like a work of someone with far more blockbuster know-how, and in that way, it's similar to any other corporate production. But there are little things that stick out in Jurassic World to make it work and set it apart from other big budget flicks. That said, it's not the best film this summer (not by a long shot) and it still cannot touch the magic of the original, Jurassic Park.What the film does right: (some small spoilers)First things first, Trevorrow makes the right call by ignoring the horrible mistakes of Jurassic Parks 2 and 3. It explains that yes, the incidents that took place in Jurassic Park were horrifying, but ultimately could not prevent the inevitability of a Universal Studios like theme park on the island of living fossils. Money talks right? Even little jokes about corporate sponsors buying naming rights to the dinosaurs allude to the fact that Jurassic World exists in a real world run by real executives dying to have product placement. This makes the movie feel fairly grounded in reality. The characters are not all dumb. That may not sound like a vote of confidence, but if you look back to Jurassic Park, you'll realize that most of the characters are really frustrating or ultra dumb. Some of that carries over to Jurassic World, but not as much as it could have. Chris Pratt is fun and believable, as usual, the child actors are decent, and other side characters help boost believability. Animatronics, although not very prevalent, do make an appearance and support the extensive use of CG well. My biggest concern was that the digital creatures would appear weightless and fake. Like they didn't belong alongside their human counterparts. But the digital creatures looked pretty good, and the few uses of animatronics helped ground the digital animals as well. The world felt real and tangible. What the film struggled to do well:I love Bryce Dallas Howard and respect her acting chops a great deal. Unfortunately her character is a struggle for me in this film. First, she is a very young executive. I think it hurts plausible deniability to have a character who looks like she could pass for a person in her late twenties direct the world's most expensive resort. Her character goes from intense and business-like, to frantic and helpless and then back again multiple times.The human villains are stupid. Their plans are stupid. Their execution of their plans is stupid. And when confronted by a raptor, they act stupid. Training raptors is already silly training them to be military weapons is just disrespectful to the audience. Deus ex machina: The final climax scene of the movie is just plain absurd and works out perfectly for all the humans. After all the dinos go crazy and kill virtually everything and everyone for over an hour, they just happen to be sensible enough to not attack each other or the humans in this final moment, choosing instead to walk away into the night. I'm trying not to spoil the end here, but it really was annoying that after all this carnage we are supposed to believe that now everyone leaves in peace. How convenient and, unfortunately, expected.Jurassic World was enjoyable, but it could have been better, and it could have even been great. I am excited for Trevorrow to go back to something a bit smaller, more artistic, and story driven. He himself has said he feels like he skipped many projects going from Sundance to this in a matter of two years I want him to make those ""in-between"" movies now.",Jurassic World

What's so stupid about the movie? I'd say Everything, except Irrfan Khan and Jake Johnson.. Irrfan Khan was the new owner of the park with a funny and a leader-type personality with a lot of faith in his crew. Anyways, the movie ruins the image of Dinosaurs. Chris Pratt taming Velociraptors was worse than the little acrobatic black girl from the second movie. The people who run the park don't know what the new cooked hybrid is made up of and they start stupid missions without the knowledge of it. Making the carnivorous Dinosaurs look like monsters and herbivores like poor creatures was also quite stupid. Very few easter eggs, just the bad-ass car from the first movie, which is started by a 16yr old brat after 20 years, the car also breaks the door of one of the compartments inside the park, keeping us wondering how the Dinosaurs stayed inside with such weak doors.

Having them go to where the old Jurassic park used to be was great considering I loved the other 3 and then bringing in the T-Rex at the end to show that he is the king of dinosaurs was great, throughly enjoyed it and would go see it again 100 times over.However there were some stale points within the film for example when the brothers were talking but it gave more connection with the audience around the idea of family.Definitely recommend it!",Jurassic World

Chris Pratt shows why he has escalated from TV star to An A list actor, playing a more serious role than last years (Guardians of the Galaxy) and shining as the films hero. Jurassic World just scored the biggest opening weekend in history because it took adults, who were children when the 1993 original was released, and brought a nostalgia feel to them and appealed to little kids who love dinosaurs. The story is pretty simple the people who opened the park created a new dinosaur who escapes and heads to where all the tourists are to eat them and they must find a way to stop the dinosaur.The climax was a little much, but ends really well.

Chris Pratt has so much charisma and the guy is so likable, that he reminds me some Erroll Flynn attributes. In San Andreas, the British kids did a terrific job, so as Ty Simpkins did it in Jurassic World, you buy every emotion that he delivers, the kid is a great actor.

In particular, I want to mention the character played by Bryce Dallas Howard (Claire). Either she was acting very poorly or her character is so badly written and annoying that it is hard to watch her despite good look.The whole script is one big cliché. Everything is predictable. The movie is worse than most B-movies I've ever seen, because not only what happens is stupid, but is also absolutely predictable (while in many B-movies some stupid things are at least surprising, some kind of improvisation) - so it was badly, without talent planned from the start and badly, without talent implemented.

This film goes the extra mile! Chris Pratt is very cool and charming as the raptor trainer 'Owen' who in my opinion is Hollywood's next action star.

What bothers me most is that the whole backstory of the parents' separation could have been removed from the film entirely without changing a thing. It was only added in there to make the film longer and to further perpetuate the clichés. Oh, and who would have guessed? The parents settle their differences in the end and decide to get back together. Whoopee.Aside from the pleasing CGI of the dinosaurs, Jurassic World was incredibly uninteresting and boring. The whole film is just people being chased to nowhere by randomly placed dinosaurs. There really seems to be no aim or reason to this, it's just kind of there. It leaves the viewer with the feeling that what they have just watched was nothing more than a waste of time. It doesn't accomplish anything.There is not a single scene in the entire film that I would deem memorable. The whole thing is as forgettable as a passing thought. You know when you watch a great film and think back to that one particular scene that tied the whole movie together and made it fantastic? This doesn't have that.

I really don't understand the whole sexist thing some people have talked about. The character Claire was awesome. The Dino action is absolutely fantastic. I felt like a kid again. Jurassic World really is a great time. Nobody is a bigger Jurassic Park fan than me and I don't understand the negative reviews some gave it. It really is awesome. Better than any of those superhero movies and makes last years Godzilla look even worse. Jurassic World is why you go to the theater. Its fun, intense, thrilling, and a wonderful sequel to the classic Jurassic Park. the characters, the way the park looks, the tributes to the old film, and the Dino action is just WOW. You guys will love how it ends. It's so awesome. Last time I was this happy I was skydiving.",Jurassic World
1073,fabfour1391,Great Movie!,8,18 June 2015,"I really don't understand a lot of people who are reviewing this movie as nothing more as an OK action flick. I honestly thought that Jurassic World was the best movie of 2015 so far. Even better than Avengers: Age of Ultron! I think most people are getting too caught up in comparing this movie to the original Jurassic Park. It is not Jurassic Park and that is not a slice on the film but credit that they actually went to something different and it worked. Jurassic World is almost more of a reboot than a sequel. There is much more action and the pace is much faster than the original. Even though I would still say that Jurassic Park had a better story and characters than Jurassic World by a little, Jurassic World was far and away better with action. But I do know story is the most important part of a film so in the end I am rating this movie a 9 out of 10. The same rating I have for Jurassic Park. And to compare with the middle 2 films, The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3, I rated these a 7 and a 6 out of 10 respectfully. I thought Jurassic World was a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend watching it if your a dinosaur lover or just a movie fan in general.",Jurassic World
1074,ocheremnykh,Jurassic Park for Dummies,1,16 June 2015,"This is not a sequel. This is a remake of the original Jurassic Park - but for total dummies. No plot to speak of - with dozens of holes; cardboard, one-dimensional characters, amateurish cast that simply can not act, meaningless lines... A Sy-Fy movie that somehow found its way to the big screen. Don't waste your time - and money - on this garbage. Looks like this project had only one objective in mind - dupe the fans of the original masterpiece into parting with their money. Judging by opening results - a very successful project. This B-movie is not about art at all - it is about marketing - and a deceptive one at that. A perfect example of how to sell total trash under a well-established successful and attractive brand. Horrible, awful, amateurish, terrible, disgusting, boring.... I would have given it 1/2 out of 10 if I could.",Jurassic World
1075,verwoert-mike,"Great action and nostalgia, but don't think too much..",8,29 June 2015,"When I read years ago that the plot for the new Jurassic Park film would include riding on dinosaurs and using them for military and covert operations I really, really wished that idea would go somewhere dark and die. What we got now with Jurassic world is a film that takes those ideas and dials them way back. This results in raptors being trained, a new dinosaur being created and bad guy (Vincent D'Onofrio's character) wanting to exploit these creatures/creations for same reason that were in that rubbish script years ago. The film wraps these pretty extreme and somewhat ridiculous elements into a nice package of dinosaur goodness in a fully functional Jurassic World with lots of nostalgic nods to the first film. That's where I think the film is at it's best. That sense of wonder and exploration is what hooked people into the first film along with the dinosaurs obviously breaking out. I just had wished this film was more about the dinosaurs instead of only the monster that is Indominus Rex and trying to take him down.The characters in the film aren't very good to say the least. There's Claire who I only found to be dumb (and slowly realizing that herself) and annoying in her journey of reconnecting with here family/nephews. The nephews themselves I didn't much care for because it was all just too obvious like most of the plot. Chris Pratt's character is the one the audience will root for, but it seems he was a little under-used and didn't get a whole lot of material aside from being the Raptor-trainer. The ending of the film is pretty damn spectacular, though, if you ask me. This, and some of the other action scenes, almost make you forget that you need great plot and characters. Rexy gets her moment to shine (I was wondering if she was going to show up) just like at the end of the first film and that final roar at the end gave me chills.Great action and nostalgia, but don't think too much..",Jurassic World
1076,car_due99,The best sequel of Jurassic Park,10,25 July 2015,"Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies, and i was really excited to see the new one. The Lost World was OK and Jurassic park 3 was awful, but Jurassic World was really good. The cast is terrific. Chris Pratt did an awesome job in this movie also as Bryce Dallas Howard. The park finally is open and working, but they decide to create a new dinosaur, that was bigger and scarier. They combined DNA of many animals and dinosaurs which it made a bigger and smarter beast. Of course there will have bad consequences. The dinosaur manages to escape and began a total chaos. Also Claire, with Owen's help, tries to rescue her nephews that are lost in the park.What i liked of this movie is the connection that Owen have with the raptors, as he can control them. Also the dinosaur was great, because of being a combination of t-rex and raptor. They made a good movie with and awesome ending, bringing the t-rex back.The movie is better than The Lost World and far more than JP3, making it a very good sequel that is totally worth watching it.",Jurassic World
1077,jaybhoy07,Action packed and thoroughly enjoyable!! Welcome back!,8,13 June 2015,"Im a massive fan of Jurassic Park franchise and i only really count the first 2 , given the shambolic third instalment but this movie not only exceeded my expectations, but it sets a new tone and a great foundation for a new set of films in the future, while paying homage to its epic original. There are some flaws with it, plot holes and unwanted story lines that are completely cheesy and unnecessary, but having said that, its a great movie, Chris Pratt excels once more as his stock rises ever more! Bryce Dallas Howard and his relationship kept me enthralled throughout, and some of the scenes were truly spectacular in this movie! Visually its stunning and the CGI is used to absolute perfection! 2 hours of sheer enjoyment! welcome back!!!",Jurassic World
1078,ramirezsamuel791,Jurrasic World 👍👍👍👍👍K,9,12 June 2015,"Hi there Guys, well lets begin with how this movie starts! All of my expectations for this film were majorly exceeded except for a few flaws that the movie starts out with, and other little things that could have been left out and other things that could have been added! Lets begin! I really like how the movie starts out it has kinda the same start as the first film with its eary kinda scary sounding jungle pipe flute, and makes you feel like your going back in time all the way to 1993 when the original came out which for me was really really great, and made me feel like this movie was not going to be whack! Also once the title appears on the screen thats when I was like YES!!! After the title appears on the screen we see eggs trying to hatch and we see our main Dino villain being born, a direct reference to the first film! Then the scene cuts to our first two main characters, Zach and Gray, these two boys are forcibly being send off to isla nublar because there parents are gonna get divorced something we don't see mentioned to later on in the movie! I personally didn't think this was necessary for the film but once we digged a little more into the film it started to make sense how there story played out and I was like okay I'll let it slide! Bryce Dallas Howards Character in this film is really great not to mention that she is the aunt of the two boys her character kinda reminded me of a mix between Julliane Moore in The Lost World and Laura Dern in Jurrasic Park! Now lets talk about Chris Pratts character, I loved how he brought the character of Owen to life, its like seeing a young Alan Grant that doesn't hate kids though! He is tenacious and wont stop at nothing to do whats right!! His acting sent chills up my spine really liked how he made the character believable! There's a scene where he has to run away from the Indomonous Rex or ( Diablous Rex ) and hides under a jeep, he sees that one of the crews gets eaten and he cuts one of the wires and showers himself in Gasoline in order to take the human smell off of him, now tell me thats not some great survival instinct! THE DINOSAURS: All the Dino's in this film are all CGI'd yes this also one of the flaws that I also let slide in the film, because there was a few scenes where we see still raptors with there mouths trapped so they wont open them and you can tell that its an animatronic, also where they get close to a brontosaurus that is dying and Chris Pratt gets close to it! The rest of the dinosaurs seem to be pretty much CGI! Not to say the least though they looked amazing and they are worth the watch! The main Dinosaur villain is way different than an actual T- Rex and I liked it because its ferocious character gave it a scary look to it and that made me happy for this film! Its Violent unmerciful, and will kill anything thats alive and walking! Its a smart and can camouflage in order to hide from others and will rip its enemy to shreds!! Now through out this whole film I did feel a sense of suspense and thrill, I really loved that, and every other second that past I was being surprised, what surprised me the most though is that (i wont go into detail) there is a scene where the two boys stumble upon the old Jurrasic Park, museum entrance, that really surprised me! One thing out of this whole film is that we don't see a T- Rex, we see a glimpse of it at the beginning, but not the entire thing! I was telling myself through out the whole film, If we don't see a T- Rex I'm going to be disappointed! But don't be alarmed we do get to see a T- Rex in action and I'm Happy to say that this T- Rex Kicks some good dinosaur ass! I definitely recommend this film, you will not be disappointed! Take your friends and family its a fun and exiting movie! Thanks for reading this review and have an awesome day!",Jurassic World
1079,cmyers87,"Not the best in the series, but the best shot in the arm",9,17 June 2015,"I'll try to keep this as vague as possible, while still highlighting the finer points. I think of this as a great shot in the arm for the series, not entirely different from how the most recent Star Trek movies have helped that franchise.For me, the best part of this Jurassic World is that you only really need to know anything about the first movie to have a grasp on this one. So if you haven't seen the second and third installments, you're not lost. In fact, in some ways, it may even help. Let's face it, Jurassic Park 3 wasn't a great addition to the franchise, so without it you may have a more appreciative view of the series.The highlights of the movie, for me, are the constant reminders of the original park, the first movie, and the spirit of what Hammond wanted to make for the world.I'm giving the movie a pretty high overall rating, and it wouldn't add up if I decided to rank different portions of the movie separately, so I'll just explain myself with the whole 9/10 thing; it really drives home the idea of the franchise, and it has everything you'd want in a summer blockbuster.Sure there are plenty of parts that are predictable, and yeah there are some things that make you want to laugh a little, but you aren't supposed to. For example (without spoiler) there's a scene that effectively calls back to every war movie ever where an integral character gets left behind somewhere and reappears later. You kind of forget about this character until that shining moment they come running back in triumphantly. This happens, but it was almost comical for me.Despite the predictive nature of the film, despite a few things I could poke holes through in certain scenes, Jurassic World delivers what you'd expect it to. It brings back a franchise that needed a shot in the arm without remaking it completely. There's plenty of options at the end for a sequel without making it required to tie up the loose ends. There's action, blood, carnage and mayhem of the dinosaur variety. This isn't a walk through the park ... but when have any of them been?",Jurassic World
1080,k-b-ego,"Sure, this movie has flaws, but i loved it",8,16 June 2015,"I'll start this review by saying that Jurassic Park is BY FAR my favourite film of all time so perhaps I am a little biased but I feel Colin Trevorrow did an outstanding job bringing back the magic I felt when I was a kid seeing Jurassic Park for the first time, especially considering he went from making a film with a budget of $750,000 to making a film with a budget upwards of $150,000,000. I don't know for a fact but that's gotta be quite the thing to get used too. For a blockbuster debut effort it was awesome, I can't help but feel like his work is only going to get better from here.I guess this film does have it's ""flaws"", the dialogue (like so many have pointed out) is fairly weak in some places but let's face it, did you really go see this movie expecting mind blowing dialogue? it's a dinosaur movie people. I found they could have used the original John Williams score at more opportune times but even that was still done quite well I felt. Some of the characters and their story lines didn't need to be in the movie at all, at some points it seemed like it was all kind of jammed in there, felt a little crowded at times. Those are all the issues I had with this movie and I can't stress enough that they DID NOT stop me from enjoying the hell out of this movie.Now for the positives folks, I'll start by saying they vastly outweigh the negatives. The new dinosaur.. wow, that thing is amazing, I was worried they were going to overdo it by making it crazy colours or covering it with spikes and horns all over the place but they didn't, they kept it simple and terrifying. The visuals in this movie were incredible, very Spielberg-esque shots and I'm not going to give anything away but if you are a massive fan of Jurassic Park such as I am there are some locations you're definitely going to recognize. This movie was made by a Jurassic Park nerd FOR the Jurassic Park nerd.If Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't convince you that Chris Pratt is a force to be reckoned with than this film will, that guy is outstanding. Bryce Dallas Howard has gone overlooked in this film for no justified reason at all, she was terrific, I've heard that some people thought the character arc was awful but to be honest I would relate it very closely to the Alan Grant character arc. I've been hearing a lot of negativity towards the two brothers in the movie and I can honestly say yeah, maybe it wasn't a great example of perfect character development but I thought both the kids did a great job, at no point did I wish they weren't in the film. Every character in this movie was portrayed very well I felt.In conclusion, I loved Jurassic World, Colin Trevorrow did a fantastic job taking me back to my childhood and for that I thank him, I can't wait to see his future work. Do me a favour folks and go into this movie trying to feel like you did before you became a critic and had your childhood and imagination intact, don't over think it, get a big greasy bag of popcorn, sit down and enjoy, I think you'll be happy you did.",Jurassic World
1081,olivercation,Its time to go back to the island,8,17 June 2015,"Colin Trevorrow helms the newest installment of the prehistoric thrillride started with Jurassic Park in 1993 as we are introduced to a theme park fully functioning on Isla Nublar with reanimated dinosaurs, corporate sponsorship and golf courses. After the comparative disappointment of the previous sequels there may be some trepidation with Jurassic World, but the formula presented is more than effective and really propels the canon rather than pushing it towards extinction. Jurassic World has been open for a decade, the initial failure of Jurassic Park has been forgotten as a wealthy investor Simon Mansari takes over the vision of John Hammond and now has dozens of dinosaurs living in harmony with petting zoos, Sea World style aquatic displays and a very special aviary. But in the face of audience apathy, a new hybrid dinosaur is in development while we see some military interest also threatening to derail the happy harmony of the island theme park. There for the ride are some young brothers on holidays. The overworked operations manager of the island facing declining numbers and balancing ethics with excitement. And finally Owen Grady, a trainer at the park living close with the dinosaurs and concerned about the direction management is looking to take. We already know what's going to go down but ill let that unfold on the screen for you in a very satisfying way.Trevorrow with Spielberg's notes and assistance has created the film that most Jurassic Park fans always envisioned, the successful realization of the theme park that was intended in the original. The detail is incredible. From a Margaritaville and Samsung sponsorship (and product placement) to the laconic employees and administrative back alleys, the creative team have obviously spent a lot of time in theme parks and put to film a world i had to remind myself did not actually exist a few times. Further than that we get shot recreations from the first film, but this time teeming with tourists and then later in the movie some scaring imagery. Jurassic World is a visual smorgasboard and a film worth watching on the largest screen possible. The characterization of the leads in Chris Pratt's Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire are spot on, we are given enough chemistry to keep the plot rolling, their gender balance is constantly at play (with the talk surrounding Mad Max it is likely to be a talking point) as Pratt and Howard take turns supporting each other and while Pratt is held as a compassionate warrior, there is no doubt Howard can do what is required. The only gender stereotype upheld is the oft used trope of a successful business woman in her mid 30's being pressured into a traditional family role by overbearing family or societal concerns. I noticed nobody suggested Pratt needed to settle down, but i digress to a minor cinematic familiarity at this point. The supporting cast is competent, Vincent D'Onofrio is a two dimensional villain, his motives clear from his appearance alone. Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus as tech heads play off each other well and BD Wong, Judy Greer and others round out the numbers as needed. The child stars of the film Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson are just passable in their co lead performances. For the first two acts of the film, their wooden acting is a distraction and it is only in the third act where their interplay comes to the fore and are enjoyable. Obviously the youth is used to add tension and a wide eyed wonder to the world, but at some point kids in peril need to be able to act for me to not want them eaten at the first sight of danger. The dinosaurs are the stars of the show here as always. With the expanded theme park we are given glimpses of a wide variety of beast as well as the returning favorites in the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and more. We are shown baby domesticated Apatosaurus being ridden in a petting zoo, a gargantuan Plesiosaur jumping for sharks like a dolphin at Seaworld and more which would lead us to believe domestication after a decade is the goal. Obviously this isn't the case and even Owen's attempted to coerce the Velociraptor are seen as him still at their mercy despite their bond. The Carnivores are again the villainous focus of the piece, the brutal hybrid Indominus Rex the most savage dinosaur in the franchise yet, cunning and modified to suit its surroundings. The fate of the island is largely uncertain as the movie goes on and this is due to the Indominus Rex's seeming invincibility and cunning. As more dinosaurs are introduced they run the risk of emasculating the image of some for the benefit of others, but a nice balance was played here as each dinosaurs defining skill was broadcast. It is interesting to see if potential future franchise films will be able to top this offering or will have to offer vastly new creations and settings. Jurassic World is an amazingly fun film, I was captivated for the entirely and it was able to provide fear, anticipation, laughs and jaw dropping imagery throughout. I wish Jurassic World was a real thing, as I would enjoy interacting with some Herbivores, but alas, we see the perils of caging such large beasts. Trying to recreate the park wasn't a great idea for the poor tourists who ventured there but making a movie and continuing this monster movie defining franchise was a very good idea indeed. If Godzilla left you underwhelmed and films like Sharknado are just too lowbrow, this is the perfect mid ground of story and visual spectacle that will have you churning through popcorn. A true blockbuster.",Jurassic World
1082,HermanGomez95,"Jurassic World: A somewhat disappointing, but overall entertaining fan service.",8,12 June 2015,"Consensus: While not able to match the original's smart script, intricate design, and general impact, Jurassic World is still a very entertaining summer blockbuster bound to satisfy the die-hard fans of the franchise. To say I'm disappointed wouldn't be false. There were several instances where I was thinking man, this could be a lot better. However, to say that the movie didn't kick me in the ass with nostalgia and stellar action sequences wouldn't be false either. Jurassic World plays out exactly as one would expect partly because it's set up is nearly identical to the first. Besides plot similarities, Jurassic World is, essentially, a fan service. Giving us dinosaur lovers everything we missed about the series. In that regard, the film is aces. There's so much action unfolding across the screen that breath breaks come at the cost of missing a raptor jump into a moving car to hack at it's driver. (Real Scene BTW). The movie also pays good homage to it's predecessor: showing us old venues, naming the control center after it's original creator John Hammond, and having composer Michael Giacchino reuse John William's iconic theme during the film. So, in regard to giving the fans what we want, the movie is golden. However, one must also address the problems in the script. Firstly, the character development is borderline atrocious. The characters are barely two-dimensional. Secondly, the dialogue is nowhere near as fast, witty, and memorable as Park's. And, lastly, the film is at times silly. Other than the script, the film fails at feeling ""Spielbergian"". While I'm one for directors implanting their mark on their films, in the realm of a franchise, it's good to reproduce similar tones of the originals. This was also a big problem in Jurassic Park III. There are also problems in the films general pace. The action starts far too early. The beauty of the original was that the first half of the film utilized simple awe to build the wonder of the park. In this film, at only 20 minutes in, the Rex is already loose and wreaking havoc. With these and a few more flaws, Jurassic World does fail at being smart. But, despite it's problems I can't find it in me to hate this movie. Why? Because it's Jurassic Park. Being one of the most instrumental movies of my childhood, my first reaction to the movie was to turn off my brain and just let the dinos run across my field of vision. However, when it came time to writing this review, the brain had to come back on. Jurassic World might not be as smart as I might've hoped, but that doesn't mean it's not miles ahead of the third one and possibly ahead of the second in recreating the feel of the original. With another blockbuster performance from Chris Pratt and a surprisingly effective Bryce Dallas Howard, Jurassic World manages to embrace it's silliness, make fun of it, and still provide a very intense and satisfying payoff. And before I end this review, I think it's important to address one thing: THIS ONE DIDN'T KILL OFF THE EFFING T-REX that alone makes it far more superior to the audacious third film. Overall, I'd have to say if you're looking for the same smarts of the first, you better let your guard down but if you want a good popcorn summer blockbuster that reminds you how awesome dinosaurs are by all means, see this movie.",Jurassic World

And that's exactly what I saw, a visual spectacle that reminded me of the first film. Jurassic World is pretty much a monster movie, which you can say the same for the other movies. Sure it's script isn't the best, and it is understandable (unlike what some people say). Chris Pratt is great, didn't expect anything less from him. Bryce Dallas Howard was great, I don't think I had seen her in anything before but she was a surprise. And the rest of the cast, some were good some were bad. The film itself did something different, creating a genetically spliced dinosaur. It was thrilling, visually great and payed homage to the first film in multiple ways. This movie was very nostalgic and revitalised the series. Overall I'll give it 10/10, it wasn't the best in terms of the script, but because it didn't set out to make some deep, down to earth drama, I'll let it slide. The rest is just utterly amazing.",Jurassic World
1085,kgajic,Wish I liked it more.,6,11 June 2015,"I didn't like it. It didn't live up to the hype for me.Like many others I was expecting a return to the roots of the franchise, but instead what I got was a decent nod to Spielberg's classics.Don't get me wrong the movie uses CGI incredibly well, it is really very polished and suited for the big screen. What it lacks is the artistic direction that Spielberg offered, adding more to the story than just its CGI aspect.The dialogue is clunky and distracting at times, a lot of humor is written in with many 'zingers', they seemed to hit fairly well but took away from the plot itself. Character development was fairly weak and parts of the back story were included solely for dramatic affect, such as the parents divorce (We only see the father twice and he speaks a couple lines).The structure didn't feel very solid and some scenes would have been better omitted. The water creature is shown thrice and whilst cool, the second is it eating the park directors assistant (It accounts for half of her screen time (??)).There's a couple of issues I had with it. Mostly I think it didn't live up to my expectations and that's why I'm disappointed, but there definitely was redeeming qualities. I just wish they'd made it less flashy with more substance, seems like a kids movie.",Jurassic World
1086,rush92287-189-46164,Jurassic World Spoiler-Free Review,8,10 June 2015,"The summer of 1993 was a memorable one for many moviegoers, as it revealed to the world the cinematic marvel that was Jurassic Park. Loved and cherished by an entire generation, its majesty still roars in the minds and hearts of the terrified child in all of us. So when Universal Studios asked freshly-proved director Colin Trevorrow to re-instate the franchise 2 years ago, many began echoing Dr. Grant's famed words, ""How can we have the slightest idea what to expect?"" Quite simply, a masterpiece is hard to live up to. Yet Trevorrow, who himself loved the original film as a teenager, was up for the challenge. And after 2 years of writing and a 22-year long wait, his audience can finally see for itself how 65 million years of animalistic charisma matches to man's own.Jurassic World establishes itself very clearly in the beginning, and gets a good joggers pace going with introducing its characters. It actually goes a little fast at first, as Trevorrow not only has to introduce the main characters and many supporting ones, but establish what their relation is to the park and each other. We are introduced to characters who work in the park, others who are on vacation there, some who manage it, etc. The good thing is that these introductions are not helter-skelter, but are meaningful and also progress the plot. The first act is a great re-entry into the world of Jurassic Park and lets us see Hammond's dream come to life. Ty Simpkin's Grey is the embodiment of our initial wonder of the original movie, as he drags his reluctant and girl-obsessed older brother (played by Nick Robinson) along. The two eventually hit some nice emotional scenes in their own relationship as they discover the parks untamed side.The second and third acts of this movie are where the rubber really hits the road for both action and emotional tension. The beauty of this movie is that while the outer conflict is fairly straightforward (a dino escapes and it needs to be captured), the subtle inner conflict amongst the primary characters is what really complicates things - as different motivations are revealed and characters discover personal growth in the midst of chaos. This goes not only for the humans, but dinosaurs as well. This subtlety and nonverbal acting is exactly what makes an otherwise apparent story much more intricate and riveting. The final act offers some nice twists and turns with both dinos and humans doing things you wouldn't expect them to do. Some relationships are soured, others forged, and some you didn't even know existed or could exist. There are both definite human heroes and dinosaur heroes in the final act, but it isn't who you think it is. No, not that one either, though it's what everyone is thinking. I'll just say, the finale surprised me with some great action that I REALLY didn't anticipate but ended up loving.The finale definitely lets you know when the movie is over, but not the story, and for the better. There isn't a real solid conclusion (which is disappointing if you are looking for closure for some characters), but the film is resolved in a very interesting way that may set up for some interesting sequels if there will be any (there likely will). There are some unresolved questions that can potentially take the plot into an entirely new direction, which is rare for a 'closed' franchise like Jurassic Park ('closed' meaning each sequel tends to stand on its own). This goes for the dinosaurs, humans, and the entire Jurassic World corporation. The final scene Director Trevorrow is very clearly a Jurassic Park fan, for throughout the movie are MANY references to the original. From practical props and effects, to settings, to characters' relationships, or even to subtle camera angles and pans, you'd be hard pressed to find even bobble-heads who make fewer nods. Fans of the original are sure to be tickled and pleased, even if it costs the film a little originality at times.The original Jurassic Park didn't have the now-stereotypical 'summer blockbuster movie' feel, but was rather timeless in the way that the story slowed down when it needed to and was fast when it had to be. Consequently, the movie can still be enjoyed to this day as a universal classic. Jurassic World has a bit more of the 'summer blockbuster' feel to it, and doesn't have the slow and steady pacing of the original, but it does make up for it with genuine emotional moments that drive the plot and characters forward well. The dinosaurs admittedly don't look totally realistic (most are CGI and only a few animatronics), but interestingly their acting seems genuine enough to make you emotionally invest in them when needed.Overall, this film comes highly recommended as a nice summer treat. Old Jurassic Park fans will enjoy it; they may or may not love it as it does have a different feel to it than the original, but they will enjoy it. Similar to how a 2015 Ford Mustang is not the same as a 1993 Mustang; they are both the 'same' car but have a different 'flavor' due to the year they were built. Jurassic World is very much a 2015 movie, and it lets you know it, but pays due homage to its 1990s roots. If you're only expecting the original majesty and nostalgia of Jurassic Park, this movie doesn't deliver all the way, but comes to a pretty good standard nonetheless. Take your older kids and teens with you, they'll enjoy it.",Jurassic World
1087,EmirPalomo7,"Same story, but with excellent digital production and much more adventure.",7,19 July 2015,"Jurassic World I can define it as a fantastic visual experience, the design of the park, attractions and dinosaurs everything was wonderful, it's just like all dream to be. I really felt tense moments during the movie, and I shuddered with Indominus rex. But I think there were situations unrealistic and impossible. And if the effects were great but being so sophisticated even dinosaurs looked fake. In the cast, Chris Pratt was awesome and Bryce Dallas Howard I liked his performance. On the negative side. Much of the time the movie was predictable, the characters are clichés of cinema, and certainly unnecessary was the scene of parental divorce, really? Overall it was a good movie, lower than the first, but it worked quite well and reflects the wonder of modern productions. 7.4/10",Jurassic World
1088,rubymccauley,Not as magical but still a spectacle.,8,16 June 2015,"*probable spoilers*I went to view this with my brother, and admittedly I have dipped in and out of the Dino movies ever since I first saw Jurassic Park. I appreciated them, but was never part of any cult fandom etc. It was apparent pretty quickly that this film didn't have the initial magic of the first film. It almost felt a bit too polished and clinical at times - but i guess this was hammering the corporate image and its subsequent ethical dilemmas home. The product placement would have looked ridiculous in the 90s but I wonder how many people even noticed it these days. I liked the references to the old park as well, for nostalgia.The twists with the iRex were very clever, but I was almost heartbroken at the valley scene with the wounded dinosaurs. Honestly, kill whoever you want but leave the damn animals, you *insert profanity here* dinosaur. Yes, i'm the kind of person who cries when animals die way more than I do humans.The final Dino battle was epic, as soon as they said ""more teeth"" i knew exactly what was happening and it was amazing, in a nostalgic way. Definite flashbacks to JP's T-Rex.Characters were good, nice mix of people in there. Chris Pratt was total alpha male material and as for Bryce Dallas Howard...I need her heels, any nude heels that can survive a Dino rampage more than warrant a place in my wardrobe. Liked the story arc with the kids, even if it was cliché. Overall, it would be a fitting end to the franchise, IMO. I wouldn't know where they could take a sequel in terms of plot, so I hope they leave it at that. I defy anyone not to get a lump in their throat from the final scene before the credits.",Jurassic World

But I got so Disappointed. ...Disappointed.  They made a Successful Jurrasic Park WITHOUT SAFETY MEASURES or even a  Procedure for evacuation plan or how to make the Tourists Safe. They  just made it too easy for the dinosaur to escape. Why not put the  Dinosaurs in Training or being ""developed"" Dangerous ones in another  islandand those dinosaurs that are Social and a bit Tame in another  island for the Tourists? It would be safer and still be spectacular.  Real DUMB Engineers and designers considering the PARK was ""state of  the art"".  Looks like this project had only one objective in mind - dupe the fans  of the original masterpiece into parting with their money.  From the beginning the movie jumps around; which makes it hard to  follow. Just because I feel sorry for crazy people doesn't mean I want  to sit and listen to them for over an hour. It was the typical shot gun  approach and came across as alienating the audience.   And then at the end. A Big Dino REX helps humans , then simply walks  away?? What the F ! The only good thing here was Owen the trainer, and  his character. being able to somehow communicate to his pack of  velociraptors.  Hahaha.. Not recommend to watch this.

1090,mneely-49598,Effective as a monster movie but not much deeper than that,7,22 June 2015,"There is a moment in the original Jurassic Park - probably my favourite moment in the entire movie - when Dr Grant and Dr Satler first arrive on the island and see the dinosaurs for the very first time (along with us as the viewers). It is a moment of wonder and awe at the sight of dinosaurs on film. We in the audience can relate to what the characters are seeing for the first time. There are no moments like this in Jurassic World but I am not sure that there can be such moments at the sight of dinosaurs on film any longer. Jurassic World seems to acknowledge this - in the film the visitors to the park are becoming tired of the same old dinosaurs, which prompts the scientists to create a new dinosaur. It's as if the producers felt the same way about their audience. Indeed there does seem to be something self-referential about this movie. And I did quite enjoy the moment when one character points out that they can charge $7 for a soda pop...kinda made me look down at my drink at that moment. It is hard to decide if a line of dialogue like ""Verizon presents Indominus Rex"" is a satire of product placement or product placement disguised as a satire of product placement. i am leaning towards the latter and since I remember the line I guess I have to admit it was effective. I enjoyed a lot of this movie - the climactic dinosaur fight scene between the T Rex and the I Rex with the raptors was a lot of fun. And I loved the new Mosasaurus. The acting was believable and I thought that Bryce Dallas Howard was a particular standout. Some of the dialogue made me cringe at times but it's all in the fun of a monster movie. A lot of the special effects are impressive too, though I found the CG lacking on occasion, especially with the non-predators. I think they were saving their CG budget for the big bad dinosaurs. So as a fun monster movie this succeeds. As a comment on our society, I'm not sure it works as well as it would like. And as a successor to the first movie, I am missing the sense of wonder. But maybe this movie is right - maybe that is not something I can get again 3 sequels later.",Jurassic World
1091,mrstagerlicious,Good cast. Fun story. Fun film.,9,12 June 2015,"This is the film we have been waiting for to take us back into the world of Jurassic Park, along with actually enjoying the experience. Just saw the movie, and I highly enjoyed it. My hopes were high, and the movie was more than I expected. It was an action packed Jurassic Park film that we would expect, along with some suspense and comedic relief. We got that serious side of Chris Pratt that I was hoping for, and a movie where i was on the edge of my seat at quite a few moments. A few characters were poorly written, with some choppy dialogue, but it is easy to forget after seeing some of the special effects. The first movie was phenomenal, and I had it at a 7.5/10. I put Jurassic World at a 8.5/10 (Rating may change after I see the movie for a second time). Overall, Solid cast. Fun Story. Fun Movie. Strongly suggest you see it in IMAX 3D for full experience.",Jurassic World
1092,lichtenstein-16338,"Fun to watch, but poorly written",6,14 June 2015,"Just found out this movie had a 2nd highest-grossing opening EVER. This troubles me, because the machinery of Hollywood supports movies that are properly marketed. And this is being perpetuated by such a smashing financial success. I was yet another person who paid $17 to see this the night before it ""opened"". The most satisfying part of the experience was the fancy unique 3-D glasses that I received. I can use them to watch all 3-D movies in the future. SCRIPT and DIALOGUE take a backseat these days... to MARKETING. As long as it makes money, who cares if the story is weak? This is the tragic rationale behind almost all new movies. And yet I can easily think of so many little tweaks that would have made the execution of the story far more satisfying. ***********SPOILERS AHEAD***********The main villain in the movie is apparently the Indominus Rex, but it should be really be a human: Hoskins.In an anticlimactic moment, Hoskins surprises the protagonists in the lab with the typical ""hahaha I am evil and this was my plan all along"" confession. Then a raptor shows up and kills him. Well, he bites his arm and we don't see the rest. Then we never hear from Hoskins again.I was expecting Hoskins to show up riding on the back of the Indominus with an amputated arm/or maybe has a way to remotely control it, or any reversal that displays Hoskins as the ultimate villain. Instead we got a boringly derivative ending that was painfully similar to Jurassic Park & Jurassic Park III.Even with this ending, it is further ruined by the fact that the sea dinosaur that jumps out of the water to deliver the killing blow was already given away when it swallowed up the flying dinosaur and the British girl. Then it shows up AGAIN to eat the Indominus, so it doesn't come across as an effective surprise (compared to the T. Rex which saves the day at the end of Jurassic Park... a reversal done correctly). There are fundamental issues with exposition and reversals that should have no place in a movie this huge. This is script writing 101 and I am stunned that it is of no importance for such high-budget movies.The only reversal that works -- when the raptors betray Pratt and turn on the humans -- is made completely meaningless because at the end, when the movie blatantly copies Jurassic Park with raptors closing in on the protagonists... he SWEET TALKS the raptor into turning back on the Indominus. May as well be a cartoon on Nickelodeon at this point because that's written for 5-year olds. I mean this is Power Rangers-quality writing. They could have simply skipped this moment. Instead, have Claire scream ""run away"" and let the dinosaurs duke it out. Meanwhile, she releases the T. Rex all the same, the slow-motion running on heels is classic, I loved that part. But she doesn't do it as a heroic effort to save the kids and Pratt but as the only way to defeat Indominus. It would be even better if she sacrifices herself at this juncture. Maybe a little harsh, but she was portrayed as a rather stringent and corrupt character who is ultimately responsible for all these deaths (along with Hoskins). To me, a far more satisfying end than some cheesy, forced romance with Pratt. The romance only makes sense if Claire ends up dying.I also would have enjoyed more gore & dinosaurs-killing-tourists terror to give this movie an R rating and a horror element which would contrast beautifully with the shiny amusement park feel that is so finely conveyed at the start of the movie. But that may be a matter of personal taste.",Jurassic World
1093,larspett,Better than expected?,7,22 March 2016,"Despite low expectations going into this, and finding plenty of things I could nitpick at along the way, Jurassic World was for the most part an enjoyable watch.That is, if you're really in the mood for dinosaurs, and willing to cut actual writing a big slack. Because if you aren't, you can easily take notes during this film and post an essay afterwards arguing how it is the worst movie ever.Me, I personally got triggered a bit by the incredibly out of place 'Disney' family drama the first 15 minutes of the movie tries to set up, then forgets all about. However that is not what's important here. The key to enjoying Jurassic World lies in waiting for those dinosaurs chasing humans scenes. Those are great. There's also a three way battle later on, but that is spoilery and frankly, hard to swallow.",Jurassic World

Huff! Cant write more about this movie. But seriously, with the kind of money and time they have taken they could have bought better minds on the table. That would have worked out a better movie. But I guess some guys only know to make poor things. None of the guys in this movie can be called creative, as the movie shows no cinematic excellence. It's a pure flat and dull show there..

This is nothing more than a 'final destination' type film. It has no chemistry, no story and worse, did they not realize that music is a character in the film? As for the kids in the film, I kept hoping the dinosaurs would eat them almost from the beginning just to spare me from their acting.You can always tell when Steven Spielberg isn't directly involved in the making of a film.I would suggest staying away.

But well, it feels like a big intro which doesn't deliver. Almost no action at all, visuals are great! The park is really beautiful but well, it feels like we just walk trough it and in the last minutes there is a bit of action with a few dinosaurs.

1098,argarachraf,"Not nearly as bad as some critics think it is, this was a fun and entertaining movie.",8,7 September 2015,"I waited a year for this movie, I'm a huge fan of the Jurassic Park saga and the dinosaurs in general. And when I entered the theaters for the first time to see it, I liked it, it was good but not great. Then I saw it again: good but not great. I saw it a third time and... good but not great. Let's talk about the things I didn't liked. While the CGI looks fine, there's an over-reliance on it. When looking at the first film, the CGI and animatronics looks stunning, even when compared with most modern films, it holds up really well. Here, they only used 1 animatronic for the apatosaurus head and that's it. They had head models for the raptors, but they put CGI over them and they looked not as real as they could have been.The story, while consistent, has some issues. The divorce subplot feels unnecessary, the movie could have done without it and it would have worked fine. The movie could have spent more time showing the park, because they went out of their way to make it believable, they made it really well. The military subplot also is not needed. About the characters, I have to say: I would have liked more from some of them. Wu needed more depth as well as Hoskins. Now the good things, and there's plenty. Chris Pratt is AWESOME. He was a great character that doesn't disappoint. Great in the action scenes and in the dialogue. Brice Dallas Howard was really good on the role, she delivered a good performance. The kids aren't annoying at all and they acted well. This is a well acted movie in general. The relationship between Owen and the pack of raptors was very well handled. They knew there was a fine line between respectful and stupid and they were respectful all the time. These raptors are portrayed as wild creatures and in more than one occasion they try to kill Owen. The indominus rex, the knew dino-hybrid was cool, she was really cool. It had a good reason to be like she was and it had some truly unexpected abilities, like camouflage and temperature changing. All the action scenes with dinosaurs are great. The ending with t rex vs Blue the raptor vs I rex vs mosasaurus is spectacular and awesome. The score by Michael Giachino is really good, delivering the best interpretation of ""welcome to Jurassic Park"" out of Willims, and also introduces really good scores. So overall, is a very decent film, not even close to the perfect masterpiece of the first one, but is much better than the third one and at least as good as the second one. Is action packed, fun blockbuster entertainment. Check it out if you have the chance, just stay away from the Hasbro Jurassic world toy line, because it sucks.7.5/10.",Jurassic World

The park was actually opened to the public, which I think every Jurassic Park fan was wishing there would come a day. Even though it all went horribly wrong of course, you got to see what it would actually be like had no genetic dinosaur out smarted the staff of Jurassic World. The nostalgia of when the original theme song played through out the movie, and that end show down between the Indominous Rex, Raptors, and T- Rex....goosebumps!! Chris Pratt was a great choice for the lead role, being the obvious funny guy in other roles and now being able to play the alpha hero.

To this day, the special effects are still amazing!! And the characters are unforgettable, the sequel was highly underrated but still couldn't live up to the first. I personally haven't seen part 3 in a while so I won't comment on it. But Jurassic world on the other hand...to sum it up, I think it was forgettable and blended in with everything else Hollywood is giving us today. I especially think it's sad that most of this generation loves and has seen this movie without even seeing the first! And when you type up Jurassic on Google, Jurassic world automatically comes up first! Not the original?! It's Also funny how this movie has cgi that is so obviously computer generated, and the actors aren't interacting with anything organic; when in the original, yes there was cgi but there was also A LOT of puppets and animatronics that the actors can interact with. Overall this movie isn't special, or anything new. It's just forgettable.",Jurassic World
1104,rafabedran,"Lacks the craft, subtleness and originality that made the first one a classic",2,13 June 2015,"I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan. The first one stayed with me dearly ever since I first saw it as a child and the two first sequels, although inferior, still brought some terrific fun moments and that delectable hint of nostalgia. The biggest issue with this new instalment comes from the fact it overdoes everything (especially the nostalgia factor) and ends up lacking the heart, the excitement and wonder of the original despite throwing everything ten times bigger at our faces.Jurassic World has its clever moments (the pigeon on the opening scene comes to mind and the great ""The Bird"" reference as the pterodactyls tear everything and everyone apart) and good sentimental sequences (the kid seeing the park for the first time even brought tears to my eyes - as did the dying apatosaurus), however the overall feeling of the whole experience is too shiny, glossy and, well, fake. What specially shocked me was how inferior the special effects were when compared to Jurassic Park, almost 25 years ago. The thing is: Spielberg did use a lot of special effects, but they served as tools to tell a story, to create an atmosphere, they were wisely and carefully placed, that's not the case here.The director, Colin Trevorrow, is no Spielberg when it comes to building tension either (the action happens in grand scale but it doesn't evolve or really thrill) and the climax is overdone and cheap looking, it reminded me of a video game. The lack of animatronics was felt, the dinosaurs didn't feel palpable like they did in the previous films (something about their design and movement was off too). The third act felt specially silly (and almost disrespectful to the franchise) as it turned the animals into human-like characters and somewhat heroes to the point one of them almost talks.In Jurassic Park we felt the dinosaurs were real animals. Even if the whole idea was absurd, Spielberg never made the audience feel that, he did the opposite and made everything as intense and wonderful as possible without stepping into the ridiculous. Jurassic World doesn't have any worries in that sense, it carries its predictableness and abrasiveness in full force and it starts becoming a bit tedious after a while. Despite having a good premise, everything about it feels artificial - the scenarios, the dinosaurs, the dialogue, the situations...and that creates a distance between the audience and the film, while in the first one you could almost feel the T-Rex breath.The main characters in Jurassic World (even though played by usually likable actors) were cartoonish in a way you didn't care for them (and a rehash of every other JP series character). The relationship established between them was so obviously contrived you can't help but dismiss it. Remember when Tim and Lex, in the first film, have finally a break from being chased and start eating jello and just look at each other smiling (before the scary raptors appear)? Well, that scene alone says much more about their feelings and relationship than I got from all the corny dialogue in Jurassic World. Spielberg knew the power of subtlety, both in the grand action scenes as in the smaller human parts. Remember the raptors in the kitchen or the T-Rex first appearance? These scenes are examples of a craft being mastered, they made me happy and terrified in equal measures, you just wanted to watch them again and again. The much hated Jurassic Park 3 actually felt more faithful to the original's atmosphere than Jurassic World despite the nonstop references.The bottom line is: Jurassic World just didn't feel part of the franchise to me (even if it revers it to the point of exhaustion), it felt weird (as if it wasn't its own film) and sometimes too silly, cheesy and absurd in all of its CGI extravaganza, all things Spielberg skillfully avoided in the first film.",Jurassic World

The pacing is a mess , characters are not fleshed out and have no personality, the humor falls flat, and there is a lack of suspense throughout.The script seems to try and throw in ever possible idea for a sequel, weaponized Dinos, engineering Dinos etc. I also found the direction to be very generic. Spielberg took special care to make sure that shots were kept from the human perspective to make the Dino's larger and more majestic, JW just uses generic CGI shots with out any creative camera placements.Overall given the talent involved everything just seemed lazy.

Duh. It's a movie about humans recreating (or rebreeding? Rehatching?) dinosaurs in a laboratory. There's sort of minimal differences to make, and expecting realism in a movie about breeding dinosaurs is asking a little much, in my opinion.It's a decent movie. It's got its funny moments, its eye candy for everybody, the plot isn't awful, the dinosaurs look pretty cool, and we even get to see Mr. Rex from the first movie pop up again.It wasn't meant to be some great big thriller; it wasn't meant to keep you wondering what was going to happen.

1108,metallianprod,"Delivers where last year's Godzilla, failed.",10,13 June 2015,"Spoilers - To be honest, I had low expectations going into this film. The lack of returning ""Stars"" from the other three films was sort of a let down but I have to say, Jurassic World blew me away. Even though I was hoping for some familiar faces, I was really going to see this film for one reason. Dinosaurs. And this film delivered all kinds of dinosaurs, both old and new. Sure, there's some plot holes and you really need to have a suspension of disbelief at some moments but that was the case with the original and it's sequels. I don't go to see Star Wars, Godzilla or Indiana Jones and pick it apart for it's realism or lack of, either. It's a fantasy ride and that's how one should approach it. I am also a huge fan of the other 3 JP films including JP3 which I see some folks bashing in their reviews here. I've also noticed a lot of people bashing Peter Jackson's Kong on that particular page. I'm not sure what their tastes are but I'm a huge fan of old monster films like Universal Monsters, King Kong, Godzilla, Jaws and Dino films like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Valley of Gwangi and One Million Years BC. I thought Jackson nailed it with his version of KK as he's a huge fan and made a film he wanted to see and I feel the filmmakers behind Jurassic World nailed it as they realized what was most important...tons of DINO ACTION. Unlike last year's Godzilla, JW gives a majority of screen time to dino carnage. This is probably the scariest of the 4 Jurassic films and the ending was the grandest of all the films. Great ending. The T-Rex is supposedly the same T-Rex from the original. I loved the little cameos by Jeff Goldblum in the background on the cover of books, etc. I loved the homages to the original film by revisiting the original complex and using the original jeeps. The homage to Jaws. I thought Chris Pratt did a great job. All in all, it was a huge success in my eyes. I can't wait for the Blu-ray and I hope they continue with more sequels.",Jurassic World
1109,vinteron666,Not a new direction - more of a Jurassic Park re-hash.,5,3 August 2015,"I was a big fan of the first movie. To be honest, I thought it was the last TRUE summer blockbuster. I read the Michael Chrichton novels and enjoyed them they way a diabetic enjoys an ice cream cone; truly a guilty pleasure. Giving in to the suspension of disbelief, I had a blast seeing the first film, an okay time with The Lost World and a slightly better time with Jurassic Park III. The two sequels drew a lot of the story plots from the two Jurassic Park books, which was great, since Michael Chrichton had a wonderful imagination and was a talented story teller.Herein lies my issues with the re-boot, Jurassic World. It's simply a re-hash of the original films. There was a lot of scene-for-scene copying going on. Two kids being looked after by an aunt (instead of an uncle)? Check! A dinosaur expert to save the day? Check! A woman who screams, ""RUN!""? Check! T-Rex roaring at the end of the film? Check! The only thing missing was Newman, but at least they got his jeep to make a cameo. Seeing as Newman got eaten in the first movie, I suppose that's excusable.I think I should have seen this movie in 3D to get the full movie-ride experience out of it. Unfortunately, I waited around and missed my opportunity and saw it 2D at a (fairly packed) theater. The noise was all there, the chase scenes using a motorcycle and ORVs was there, Jeff Goldblum's photograph was there, which makes me think he's going to be in the Jurassic World sequel. What was missing? Well, Michael Chrichton's imagination for starters.The writers grabbed all of Chrichton's (RIP) original ideas and made them unoriginal. Directing was poor; the only character development worth mentioning was what they did with the genetically modified alpha beast. To be honest, there was almost too much happening on-screen and at times, it seemed like the CGI rendering couldn't keep up with the processing speed of the computers they were using to build the animation. In 3D, you probably wouldn't notice, but in 2D, the poor flicker rate was enough to give me a headache that lasted for the rest of the day.Overall, the movie was a fun summertime romp.

1112,geozel,Thank you for bringing back my childhood memories,10,12 June 2015,"I remember sitting in the movie in the first row watching Jurassic Park back in 1993. I was 9 years old and this movie touched my soul. Since then I'm a dinosaur and Spielberg fan. I saw that movie at least 20 times but tell you the truth the second and the third entry in the series didn't met my expectations. I only saw those 2 times. I was very happy when I heard that they started the production of Jurassic World but I had concerns as well. 22 years have passed and I grew up. When someone becomes adult it is much harder to bring his inner child to the surface and to enjoy a movie without criticizing small things and searching embarrassing goofs.I decided to go to the cinema without any expectations and try to spend the next 2 hours focusing on the fun factor.Friends, this was 2 hours well spent. I enjoyed every single second of this movie. The dinosaurs and CGI is unbelievable, the story is cool, the park is awesome and the characters are likable. The conversations are solid and there is lot of things to smile and laugh at. I almost forgot to mention the atmosphere: It's scary but also believable. The whole movie is just working.I got exactly what I had gotten 22 years ago and what else I could wish for?Thanks to everyone who were involved in the development. You brought back my childhood for 2 long hours. I hope this journey will continue soon.",Jurassic World

What a mistake... it is all down hill from the original and I am not enthusiastic about checking out the sequel to this one.This is just another watered-down HOLLYWOOD cash grab. Sure, there are some good effects and some neat ideas, but all in all, we've seen this movie three times before!... Once was enough.If you're still not sure, take a good look at the poster!

1115,bjumisen,"Beautiful scenery, bad story, lame characters",3,22 June 2015,"This is a really bad movie! Of course, this being the 3rd sequel I wasn't expecting that much. Kind of like when I went to see Jurassic Park 3. Only then I was positively surprised. In contrast to most other reviews, I must say JP3 was much better than this Identity-struggling, standing-on-shoulders-of-giants disaster. No suspense, no build-up, no identity, bad, ridiculous previsible story.There won't be need for a parody of this movie, because it handles that part very well on its own. Of course most people can tell the story without watching it: Dinosaurs get loose and hunt/eat people. That was the case even in the first Jurassic Park. But then there was an eerie feeling, a building up of the scenario and a perfect atmosphere where the grandeur of John Hammond's top-of-the line theme park vision, the struggles of humans trying to control nature, and the chaos theory that Ian Malcom explained so well. Here, we meet a bunch of bland characters, setting the stage for an obvious story development. The genetical modification of dinosaurs that this movie revolves around feels like something the writers just came up with, in order to be able to bring something new - a dinosaur we've never seen or heard about before, to the table. Then there is the pseudo-shady military bio-weapons scheme that is also attached. This part is very similar to many other sci-fi movie plots, and one that has worked well before. In JW, however, this aspect, as well as all others - the suppressed romance between Owen and Claire , the family problems of Zach and Gray, the adventure of a dinosaur theme park, the disaster movie scenario with thousands of people in danger, never get to develop and give the movie some sort of identity. It's like the movie tries to be all these genres, and becomes neither. Throw in dinosaurs, problematic kids, a silly billionaire who flies a helicopter, a nerdy computer guy, a poorly constructed bio-weapons plot, a romance between the rugged animal trainer and the high-heeled business woman. Then show small parts of all this without any connection to each other while trying to keep all these events unfolding in a somewhat logical way time-wise and you got Jurassic World. There is never any suspense, and the ending is so ridiculous it is on par with 2014 Godzilla.However, there are some things I do like about this movie. The scenery is beautiful, and the look of the park with all it's details - petting zoo with small dinos, souvenirs, amazing tours in trains, gyrospheres, boulevards with restaurants etc. really manages to build off of the very clever product placement of movie merchandise in the first Jurassic Park, while also modernizing the dinosaur theme park concept. It all looks quite realistic in terms of how I imagine a Dino park would look and present itself. There are also some nice easter eggs, hints and memorabilia from the original movie, which makes you smile a bit, but you also can't help but feel they were thrown in there in the same, almost haphazardly way as the previously mentioned movie stereotypes. The park, as it looks during the introductory 20-30 minutes of the movie looks quite welcoming and like a place that would be a fantastic experience was it real. However, I could have settled for 30 minutes of just watching the park and the concepts in it, without having to suffer through the intellect-raping attempt at a story. Recommended instead: a couple of episodes of Walking with Dinosaurs.",Jurassic World

1119,Hornby4092,Not a brilliant film but a lot of fun,7,12 June 2015,"Went to see this last night with the missus, so here's my review.The film opens and quickly establishes the main characters. It was difficult to become endeared to the characters, although by the last 40 minutes they grow on you quite a bit. The action picks up fairly early on but peaks just after the gyroscope scene, in which the film hits a bit of a slump for about 30 minutes.After the gyroscope scene the film becomes a much more by the numbers action movie, but as previously mentioned, by this point the characters are much improved, even though the relationship between Owen and Claire reeks of misogyny.Obviously the main thing you're going to watch this for is the dinosaurs. The Indominous Rex is the star of the show, and the Raptor's are pretty damn good as well even though the sub-plot involving them and Owen is extremely cheesy. Plus there's an appearance from a familiar face who everyone will be cheering for.To summarise, whilst the film fails to emulate the standard of the first film in terms of plot and acting, there is a lot to enjoy here, and the plentiful action scenes are a lot of fun, albeit a little short in duration, but this is understandable as the film pushes the boundaries for it's 12A/PG-13 rating.Overall I would give this film a 7/10.",Jurassic World

1121,attoexa,Wanted to love the movie - but HATED it instead!,1,23 June 2015,"Attention! Spoilers ahead!First I would like to say that I'm not an English native speaker. So please excuse any mistake I might make. Also, this is the first review I write here on IMDb, and I hate that it has to be a bad one!I really wanted to love this movie, because I'm a big fan of the franchise, and I simply loved Chris Pratt's performance (as, I guess, many of us did) in ""Guardians of the Galaxy""! In that movie he played such a refreshingly natural, witty and self-ironic character! But even he couldn't compensate for the extremely bad writing and characterization of THIS movie!The original Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies of all times. And I think John Williams wrote one of his best scores (and he has written so many fantastic scores) for that particular movie (and its two successors)!So, as my expectations were understandably high, my disappointment with this movie was, as I'm very sad to say, almost absolute! There are only VERY few movies, during which I was even tempted to leave the theater... THIS was one of them! I barely made it through the ending! As soon as the movie ended, I left the theater (which I almost NEVER do!), and the moment I got back in my car, I started to rant. I STILL cannot believe how bad this film was! So here is why:First of all, the characters. With the only exception of Chris Pratt's character, there was NOT A SINGLE ONE in this movie that I found to be even remotely likable! And, dare I say, there are quite a few of them. And that's already part of the problem! WHAT'S THE FRICKIN' POINT OF THE STORY??? I guess, there just isn't any...Unfortunately this one of the ever growing number of films that just don't HAVE a point to them, aside from the aim of making lots and lots of money at the box office! Jurassic World is exactly like its ""villain"" dinosaur - the stupidly named ""Indominus Rex"" - in that it's been ""engineered"" to appeal to the masses. That's all there is to it. But at least for me that's not what I'm looking for when I buy a movie ticket!I must also say that I find it VERY peculiar when I see all those 10/10 reviews from people stating in the first paragraph of their review, or even in its title(!), that they found the movie to be ""predictable"". One of them even wrote that he or she ""knew from the get-go that the movie would not be as good as the '1993 masterpiece"". So why, I ask, do these people still give the movie a 10/10 rating??? I just don't get it.When I pay good money to watch a movie, the last thing I want is ""predictability"", ""flawed logic"" or ""poor characterization"", all of which this film features in abundance!The characters in this movie are, all and sundry, UNBELIEVABLE (in the worst sense of the word). And I have to add that that is also true for Chris Pratt's character. I mean, please: An ex-Navy soldier... training velociraptors? FOR REAL?? How, may I ask, is he even qualified for that job?? Was he a paleontologist or an animal trainer before he joined the Navy?? Okay, I get it... Navy = tough guy with lots of guts. Great writing, I must say! Who could have thought of THAT! That's brilliant...! NOT!!! It's absolutely stupid!! Why should an ex-Navy seal know the first thing about taming dinosaurs (assuming they COULD be tamed)!And, to be honest, and as much as it pains me to say this, but Chris Pratt is an absolute miscast for this role! He just isn't the type, neither for an ex-Navy soldier nor for a wild animal tamer! I just didn't buy it. Sorry! He is simply far too ""cute"" for that, too much ""nice guy"".And what about that stupid ""love story"" between him and that ""doll"" in the white dress and that grotesque hair-do?? Who is to believe that THOSE TWO would EVER have something going between them? Well, I for one didn't.And those two boys... *sigh* They are not even cute or funny... only annoying. Their sole purpose in the movie seems to be to ""get in trouble"" so that their ""aunt"" has something to scream about.I could go on and on and on... The plot is an absolute mess. There is no real story (at least none I could discern). Instead it's one mere ""stringing together"" of scenes that are only there to give the makers of the movie an opportunity to put in more CGI, more brainless action, another chase, another explosion, another violent death of some more or less unknown or completely nameless character, and so on and so forth... *yawn*But the most annoying fact for me was that the ""evil scientist"" who created the whole mess gets away in the end. To me that's a sure-fire sign that there is going to be another sequel... But I will definitely NOT waste a single dime to watch that one! That's a promise!Shame on those mercenary moneybags in Hollywood for tainting yet another ""hallowed"" movie franchise!! As if all those completely unnecessary and unbearably bad ""pseudo-prequels"" of the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises hadn't already be more than enough!! Instead of developing new ideas and creating new and innovative movie franchises, all that modern Hollywood seems to be able to come up with is taking what's already there (and very hard to improve upon!) and then fiddling around with it in such an uncaring and disrespectful manner! I find that incredibly contemptible!My advice: If you loved the original Jurassic Park movies: Save your money and do not go see this movie! I DO NOT recommend it at all!",Jurassic World

1123,OliverGinger,Dumb fun,7,21 June 2015,"Let's start by saying that, it's not a Jurassic Park film. A terrible cliché, but a series/sequel will always be compared to its predecessor(s), whether consciously or subconsciously. So let's get that out of the way first. The reputation of the first film is so positive, this film will always have had mixed reaction. However, relating to this issue, the main response from people seems to be this; it doesn't matter.People I spoke to tried to go in to a screening without having any expectations, and this is obviously the best way to treat the film. What you get is a popcorn movie with big dinosaurs, but wasn't that what the first film was? Well, let's come back to that in a bit. The main dinosaur antagonist in Jurassic World is well designed, and suitable scary and loud. The initial carnage scenes in which it makes itself known (the dinosaur) are well paced, violent, and probably some of the most gripping scenes, setting the tone for the rest of the film. However, that tone hardly changes, and when it does, it gets more ridiculous than scary or tense, something that the first film excelled at (Though, it's strange to say the Jurassic Park 'excels' at things, because, you know, Steven Spielberg and all).The action sequences are, expectedly, the film's strengths. Some of the individual sequences are very good, including the one mentioned in the previous paragraph, and one involving the main protagonist, played by Chris Pratt, zooming into the deep forest on a motorcycle, surrounded by a team of raptors (as seen on the trailer). However, others are absolutely ridiculous, in a kind of, ""this is absolutely ridiculous"" way. The finale is laughable, though still somewhat entertaining.There's not much point in speaking about the plot, as it's sort of irrelevant (and incredibly hole-y), and the characters, well, there aren't any (the best 'characters' are easily Pratt's gang of raptors, led by the more-charismatic-than-anyone-on-screen, 'Blue'). As we know, Pratt is an entertaining performer, but here, it feels that his talents have been wasted. I would have personally liked to have seen more 'cheekiness' and more one-liners from him, but he can only work with what he's given. In relation to this, some of the dialogue scenes so corny and ridiculous (there's that word again), that you just wish it was Jurassic Park....OK, so I guess it is difficult to talk about Jurassic World without frequently relating it to the first film. And it's this reason as to why I was slightly disappointed by it. It's fun, sure, it's loud, it's big, it's great to look at (most of the time), it's fast. But it's not (as) scary (as the first), and, unlike the first, it's not smart. It's dumb. Dumb fun, but dumb nonetheless. Going back to what I said about it being a popcorn movie, which was also the idea for the creation of the first film, is where the problem lies. The first film has a reputation as one of the greatest popcorn movies, but it's smart. It has a minimalist, yet classic adventure plot. It has characters; it has people you care about. I know it's difficult to come out with such gold as Spielberg and crew did, because, you know, it's Spielberg and all, but why couldn't it be smart as well as fun? Why couldn't we have a great time as well as caring about the characters? There's plenty of proof out there that films can be all these things.Yeah, I know, they shouldn't replicate any of the previous films, and they should make it their own. But simply by dumbing it down? Is that the main thing that summer blockbusters should be nowadays, as opposed to the days of the first film? But maybe I'm out of touch.",Jurassic World
1124,hyper_man_zach,Very good movie has everything the first had and more could almost say this reinvents the series,9,14 June 2015,"I found this film quite enjoyable, it had everything that made the first film great including Spoiler The original T Rex from the first film. Where in the end of Jurassic Park you have the T Rex and Raptors fighting, at the end of Jurassic world they become mutual friends for the greater good. Now the main characters in the movie are every way enjoyable as the characters in the first movie. Pratt's leading male role is spot on and a fresh take at trying to make the dinosaurs seem higher evolved than just killing machines which branches out on the premise from the first film when the Raptors were attacking the fences for weaknesses and remembering. Dallas Bryce while being a stickler for work found a way to save the day and save her nephews just Like Hammond did for his grand kids by getting all the electricity in the park back up in the first film.So to recap we have. 1. Dinosaurs, just like in JP. 2. Setting was in a theme park just like JP. 3. Enjoyable lead male and female characters that were bad asses like in JP. 4. T Rex saving the day in the end like JP. 5. Kids lost in the park during the dinosaur attack just like JP. 6. T Rex looking BA and roaring showing his dominance JP. 7. All the main characters survive and are happy at the end of the film they all made it JP. So really Jurassic world and Jurassic park are basically the same movie with Jurassic world taking place with the park actually opened. While not better than the first it spring boards over the 2nd and 3rd ones.All in all the movie is a great way to bring back the franchise to its former glory and capture a bit of what made the original so great. People are naturally going to hate it because there are those that think a movie should never have a sequel and leave the original alone and are going hate the movie regardless so don't listen to them people just go and see Dinosaurs on the big screen wreaking havoc and showing their dominance.

1125,turnsfire,"Ridiculous product placement, childish plot",1,12 June 2015,"I'm over the ubiquitous advertising that is going on in movies these days. I counted no less than 10 global brands in the first 10 minutes of the film, from Verizon Wireless (called out by name), to Pepsi and Tostitos, Coca Cola and Dasani, Mercedes, Samsung... I went to see a movie about dinosaurs to ESCAPE the real world, not be reminded of it. It's been a long time since I saw a movie in theaters, and after this, I feel used - I don't think I'll be returning any time soon.After all the real-world advertising right out of the gate, it was hard for me to take the rest of the movie seriously. The plot seemed like it was written for a 2 year old. Incredibly childish dinosaur battles made a total mockery of the intelligence and respect Michael Crichton and the original JP showed for these creatures. The most fierce creatures from the originals have now been tamed, and are supposedly working with humans. The ""climax"" of the movie was embarrassing. The tension from the original movie was nowhere to be found, no sense of fear, no danger - the whole thing seemed like a tame amusement park ride.

1136,GibboAssassin,Interesting If Not Predictable.,9,17 October 2015,"As someone who grew up watching the Jurassic Park films (and still doesn't care in the 3 one was a bit bad), I have to say I was excited when I first heard this was becoming a thing. The trailer excited me and awoke a childish nature in me I haven't felt in years. I was stoked for this film and what I was was... interesting.I will say this, the story was predictable. I liked some elements of the plot but I wish that the creators had taken a slightly different route with it all. I loved the I.Rex and how it worked, it was the first genuine smart animal that we encountered that wasn't meant to be smart. I liked some of the characters however the acting was a bit wooden at times (I don't mean to bash the actors in any way). I feel like the script writers went too 'cliché' with this film and didn't realise it until after it had released (if they realised it at all).There was still something magical about this film. It wasn't really as gritty or hard paced as the previous three but a lot of time had passed since them and we came to expect things from people who wanted to change some stuff. What you have to remember is it's been 22 years since the first Jurassic Park was released, things have to change otherwise we'll be repeating the same story over and over again, just with different technology involved.All in all, I liked it. Some parts were disappointing but I got the Jurassic Park vibe that the other films managed to beat into us. When I first watched Jurassic Park (the first film) I was one years old, nearly two and it was at Christmas. I sat on my Dad's chest and was captivated even at such a young age. Jurassic World may be cliché and the acting may be a bit off at times but I'm extremely impressed with it all. The ending has become one of my favourite sequences in film history and it probably will be for years to come.In short, take your kids to go see it. To the people who watched the originals, it's not awful but it's not the 10/10 movie we were expecting but it still stands up for itself.",Jurassic World

Maybe this is because I've only watched one trailer and avoid all other promotional material (I always do this because I find these days just too much is given away). To me this is had the same awe and spectacle as seeing the original when I was 12, yes it's hard to live up to a classic film 20 years later, you can't instantly pin down a classic, but I believe this was a really good sequel, much better than all the other Jurassic Park sequels and many other 2nd films in franchises.It's hard to wow an audience these days but I believe that this film managed to bring back that summer blockbuster feel of the 90s. It was easy to gloss over some of the more negative elements for me, the product placement at the beginning was excessive and obvious, especially as the film was taking about the commercialisation of everything. It almost felt like a commercial for Mercedes at one point. But to get into the details without spoiling, basically Chris Pratt was great as Peter Quill Dinosaur hunter, we can gloss over that too, because he came across as totally bad-ass and believable, and Bryce Dallas Howard who had the most in the way of character development didn't feel stereotyped or forced, quite identifiable actually, and her chemistry with Pratt was superb. Yes the plot was quite obvious, but they did say this was a mix of remake and sequel, so some elements are going to be reused. For one I didn't actually find the kids irritating, even less so than the whiny brats in the original film. They actually had a point being there and were even able to show resilience, being able to look after themselves, they were not just there to be saved. The deaths seemed to hit home more, although we instantly knew who was going to get eaten, this didn't distract from the fun of watching it happen. There was enough twisting and turning of the plot to keep us on our toes and plenty of scares, I don't think I've jumped so much for years! There were loads of geeky nods to the original film which make us very happy and the supporting cast were all good and believable without being stereotyped, (which happens so often in sci-fi movies,) especially BD Wong, now that's a villain for the 21st century.I wont go further into the plot, I just think you need to go see this film. It's action packed, CGI madness, but deserves a lot higher praise, especially after the disappointment this year of Avengers 2. I can easily see this spurring on more films and with this level of quality I can't wait to see what comes next as it was a brilliant addition to the Jurassic Park world!",Jurassic World
1138,Lloyd-edgar,That is one big pile of s**t.,6,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World was a Jurassic failure in my personal opinion. I knew this by the opening shot: A small dinosaur hatches from an egg. The funny part about this was that 20 years ago the original Jurassic Park did the exact same shot and a lot better. Practical effects are replaced with unbelievable amounts of CGI in this cash-grab reboot.I was so pumped for this film when it was announced. I love Jurassic Park, so much that I wrote my own fourth instalment when I was only seven years old. It may come across that I'm being overly critical of the film but the fact of the matter is: Jurassic Park is one of my favourite films and to see this reboot wear the same title frankly sickens me.This film has none of the imagination or creativity of the original, the characters are bland, clichéd stereotypes that aren't likable. Apart from Chris Pratt's character Owen, I just wanted everyone to die so the film would end quicker.A big middle finger to the audience is the inconsistent rules of the main dinosaur. It's called the indominus Rex and it can apparently sense heat patterns, but of course only when the plot demands it. In the very scene that simple concept is introduced Chris Pratt hides from the Dino under a car. Yep, the plot forgot it's own rules, because the dinosaur stands and just walks on.Now I have to give the film credit where it's due, and that is in the fight scenes. The spectacle of a T-Rex and a velociraptor tag-teaming against the main enemy dinosaur is ridiculously funny. Now while this is well choreographed and feels quite exciting, I can't help but remember this is a Jurassic Park movie.If this film was called something other than Jurassic Park, I'd probably have had a lot more fun with it. It's just the sad fact that it pails in comparison to the brilliant original.Another problem I found with the movie was that the characters. Of course you have the up-tight manager character who plans everything, the angsty teen and the know it all little brother. This is a clichéd and predictable script not worthy of the Syfy channel.The only saving grace of the film is Chris Pratt's character: Owen. He's funny and likable, and is easily the most unique character of the film. He's a lovable rogue not unlike Han Solo from the Star Wars trilogy.I guess the bottom line is that this film is a crap Jurassic Park movie, but an okay monster flick. If you're going for dinosaurs killing people, have fun because that's really where the film shines. But if you're going to relive the magic of the original, you may as well keep your £6.",Jurassic World

1140,Gareth-UK,I don't understand the rave reviews,5,7 July 2015,"If you have seen the original Jurassic Park then this film follows a very similar plot line. I got very bored about 20 minutes in as it was all so very predictable - including the ending. I appreciate it is very hard for film ""franchises"" to do something surprising in the sequels (Alien, Jaws, Star Wars, etc etc) but this film was so transparent it spoiled the viewing. I also found the gender stereotypes quite annoying and even insulting. At best this was something to do on a cold and wet July evening and at worst was a waste of money. I get the feeling that the financial backers want a safe formula so as to make a profit. Seldom do I see an idea that I think is bigger than the film these days - and when will the financial backers and directors ever learn that CGI cannot make up for a powerful story? We the viewing public are being robbed of a true cinematic experience to give safer financial returns...This was an awful film. 5 is being very generous.",Jurassic World
1141,trailbyfire,Nostalgic? Brings back your childhood? The sequel that Jurassic Park deserves? Whose press agent is writing this?,5,14 June 2015,"I'm a bit baffle at some of the reviews that praise this film. Yes, it's better than Jurassic Park 3 and its really dumb fun but some of the praise seem bit robotic, like they are going through talking points given by a press agent. Nostalgic? Because this movie takes place on the same island as the first Jurassic Park? Honestly, this does not look like the same island but whatever. Bring back your childhood? Was your childhood memory of Jurassic Park filled with cardboard cut outs as human characters, sexism, bad acting and an over indulgence of CGI? Seems so. The sequel that Jurassic Park deserves? From what I remember from Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, it had smart characters dealing with a moral dilemma about messing with the natural order of things and dealing with the consequences of their actions. The only sequel in the Jurassic Park series that carried over the themes of the original Jurassic Park was Steven Spielberg's follow up, The Lost World. While The Lost World was not as good as the original Jurassic Park, it still manages to be a strong sequel that at respects and accomplishes what the original sets out to do. Jurassic World only really has dumb characters running away from a monster bend on killing everyone in a amusement park. Again, Jurassic World is for a fact a much better film than the horrendous Jurassic Park 3 but that's because it's dumb fun, not the second coming of the original Jurassic Park.Chris Pratt is playing his usual roguish frat boy self and it does gives the movie one of it's few likable characters but he can't hold this movie by himself with with bad card board cuts outs as characters, some very bad acting and out of place sexist stereotypes of women. Not to mention a script that is pretty flimsy with pretty bad dialogue. With what was once a science fiction thriller with the first two Jurassic Park films went off the rails with Jurassic Park 3 when it became a sad family film with dinosaurs. Jurassic World tries to bring back the thrills somewhat with some dumb B movie fun with a monster on the loose film but its hurt by the hint of the bad family drama and unlikable characters of Jurassic Park 3 with two boys trying to get their aunts attention. Because of that, none of it works very well off each other and while Chris Pratt is likable hero, he's not given the tools necessary thanks to the bad script and so so directing to hold back the tidal wave of cheese that was thrown on the audience once the film was done.So yes, it's better than Jurassic Park 3 but no,it's not nostalgic and its not the sequel that Jurassic Park deserves. If this bring you back to your childhood, you really do have issues you need to deal with. In reality, Its a semi decent B movie entry to the series that manages to entertain despite its many problems. If you go in believing the hype from talking points from publicist trying to sell this film to you as the second coming of the original Jurassic Park, you will be very disappointed. Go in with realistic expectations and you will be rewarded.",Jurassic World

I can't say enough good things about this film. It is definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Seriously, don't miss the chance to see this while it's on the big screen. I would say IMAX 3D is definitely the way to go. Thank you to all who were involved in this film. I haven't enjoyed watching a movie this much for a very long time.

1143,davidhj-paisley,Accept it for what it is.,5,2 August 2015,"To create a film after the first 3 successful movies needed an angle and I have to say the one they created was plausible - well in terms of the far-fetched context we already accept the rebirth of dinosaurs in. What wasn't so was the ridiculous bond between Chris Pratt's character and the raptors, which has his buddy saving the day at the end by intervening when the Ty Rex was about to be dealt the killer bite. If you accept the film for what it is, an adventure romp written for teenagers thirsty for highly improbable action and minimal story cluttering the watch then it is enjoyable. However if you seek a grown up film or perhaps enough wit and story to sustain a parents interest whilst watching with the kids then you probably won't. Reading other reviews I have to say that I agree with those who hanker for the Jeff Goldbloom character whose sarcastic insight stitches the first two films together beautifully. I was, on the whole, left craving a story at the end and would even have enjoyed seeing all the characters gobbled up!",Jurassic World
1144,ledoyan,"If I had children, I wouldn't want them to see this",2,10 July 2015,"There is a scene in this where bad-ass soldiers sit in a heli, when a dino-bird flies by and one of the soldiers instantly shoots it down, then smiles with pride. I was 15 when Jurassic Park came out and one thing that it did for me (and probably millions others), among entertaining and exciting, was to teach me a lot about how and why to respect nature and life in general. This movie does almost the opposite. I don't think John Hammond started the whole thing to make money, like a little boy he was dreaming about traveling back 65 million years and share that with the world. It was the lawyer who got greedy and he was the first (and only) one who got eaten by the T-rex, here the greedy bastard is the last one getting killed. Whoever wrote this, has clearly no idea about animal behavior and uses animals/dinos only as plot devices to create tension or empathy or fear or simply excitement, so this film does to the essence of Jurassic Park what its characters do to dinos: turning it into an empty capitalistic attraction. I can only hope that kids watching this crap have seen Jurassic Park before, because Jurassic Park ended with a scene where a group of birds fly over the ocean and the heli flies along with them... a beautiful picture this movie has nothing to do with and certainly didn't understand.",Jurassic World
1145,glenmacleod,"Awesome film, not the originals, and rightfully so. On par with the first.",8,14 June 2015,"**MINOR SPOILERS THROUGHOUT, MAJOR SPOILERS START WHERE MARKED** REMEMBER this is Jurassic World, not Jurassic Park. Although this is in a way ""Jurassic Park 4"", I feel like they're trying to make it ""Jurassic World 1"", instead. They've left it open for another film. I expect the next film will be called ""Jurassic World 2"", not Jurassic Park 5. I don't mind the idea that there's a hybrid dinosaur, I mean, let's be honest, it's all genetically modified anyway, and they've got a nice back story as to how and why they made this new dinosaur. People within the film even laugh at the name it was given, saying its ""terrible"", so don't be put off by that. To me this was a solid film. Started off slowly, and not feeling ""Jurassic Park-y"" much, but then started to pick up, and JP feeling started to kick in. A lot of people have said there's a bad script, but all in all, I wouldn't say so. I never noticed a point where I thought ""the script there was terrible"", and I tend to do that quite a lot in films, even when nobody else sees a problem. The downside to me, is the raptors. **MAJOR SPOILERS START HERE**I was fine with the raptors being ""tame"" in the beginning, I knew something would happen, and obviously in the forest it did. I felt like they were intelligent enough to trick Chris Pratt into believing he could trust them to let them out, and I was quite excited when the raptors turned on them, as what's a JP film without raptor killing? However, the raptors then ""protected"" them at the end, which I didn't like. They could've found another way to do the ""final battle"", because friendly raptors, are not the way it should have been done. To me, 2 reasons made this only ""on par"" with number 1, and not better. 1. the raptors. 2. It's not Jurassic Park 1, never will be, and never should be. Jurassic park is a classic, and this film doesn't have the same classic feel as the first film, as it shouldn't. Wouldn't this film feeling like its the same as the first film taint them both? It's a sequel, not a remake. The feel of it was good. Not the same, and rightly so. I will be able to watch the old films with the same childhood feeling within me, knowing that it's a classic. This film brought out my childhood, but not in the same way. I didn't want it to give me a different feeling when watching the older films, and make them feel less special, and it won't. I'm happy with the film, asides from the raptors. Its rightful place is not to feel like the originals. It needs to feel 'modern' and 'new', otherwise, doesn't it remove some prestige from the older films? Some nice touches with reference to the old park. Go watch the film. You won't regret it.",Jurassic World
1146,liabilityman,Does not deserve the hype it gets,1,31 August 2015,"I am giving this title a 1 in an attempt to bring down the score that it does not currently deserve.This movie had its cool moments, but mostly just dumb.Way too many special effects and just unrealistic scenarios. e.g. At one point a woman in high heels is outrunning a T-rex. Remember in the original Jurrasic park the T-Rex was chasing down a Jeep at top speed!No spoilers but the ending is terrible and cheesy.Chris Pratt is pretty much just an extra in his own movie.It's a shame that it got so much hype that they are already planning the sequel.

1147,migukteacher,Not even Chris Pratt could save this garbage,3,5 July 2015,"It's like they're not even hiring or involving writers at all to make movies these days. They're in such a hurry to tell this story that the dinosaurs begin to go haywire before the viewers can decide whether they care if anyone besides Chris Pratt dies. Turns out we don't.It's almost as if they just hurried through this one because it was just a way to lay the ground work for future JP movies that are equally ill-considered. I hope the Jurassic World ride and theme park at Disney World is a little more subtle about taunting attendees the way they did movie-goes ""Aren't the lower classes hebetudinous dullards, Chauncy? I daresay they will jam their corpulent behinds in dirty theater seat over and over to drool on one another and stare at it!!! Mwa hahaha!!!"" There is nothing remotely clever, surprising, or even funny that happens in this plot line whatsoever. A person who had never seen this movie could tell you what it was about by guessing randomly at the title...which is apparently how the screenwriter did it...or at the very least the suits that overrode every last decent idea the writers had and superimposed their own idiotic vision instead.I'm sure all the flat-earth mouth-breathers who don't even believe dinosaurs existed will be gratified to see science mocked by the cinematic equivalent of hurling feces at people meant to represent the academics they mock with Intelligent Design Museums. Would people run randomly in the streets and not into the building while pterodactyls flew overhead snatching people up and eating them? Would a brief appearance by Jimmy Buffet (didn't notice) distract from all the bad writing and stupid characters? Tons of Jurassic herbivores...no Jurassic plant life. The female lead is thoroughly unlikable in ever way and doesn't die. And her hair is so awful...a better stylist would have covered all of that face. Hey I wonder if the dumb rich guy is gonna die in a helicopter crash after they've dropped a dozen damn hints about how bad he is at flying? Oh...he's dead two minutes after he takes off. Heli crash. The walls are all woefully short. Real animals can jump like kangaroos on WW2 surplus crank...but a four-meter hybrid predator should be okay in an enclosure with no roof...right? Pretty much NO ONE can outrun a damn lizard of any size...except maybe a chameleon. The main dino can change colors but they didn't use the word ""chromatophores"" a word every ten year old knows? Nope, the entire premise of this movie is that either the producers are really stupid or this is how stupid they think most people are. To say this is like John Wick with dinosaurs is giving the writers and producers credit for having spent any time on anything other than the broad concepts of the movie and the title...which they didn't. Hollywood is actively trying to insult Americans' intelligence and most people don't even have enough brains to be insulted...shame shame shame.",Jurassic World
1148,theslightestidea,Sorry to disappoint but it isn't good. The script is terrible and predictable from beginning to the end.,3,5 June 2015,"I saw the film last night at an advanced screening in New York City for the press. I'd be surprised if this gets a fresh critic score on rotten tomatoes.You know the feeling of awe you get when you watch Jurassic Park? You get that because when you watch it Spielberg made you believe this place could actually become a reality. Jurassic World doesn't come close to achieving this, and because of that it failed. Every sequel since the first film has thought the reason why people loved Jurassic Park was just because of the dinosaurs. That is a big reason why it was so successful, but that is only a piece of why the movie is so great. The rest is great characters, great acting, great direction, great score and a great script. Jurassic World has none of those. Without those elements how can you sweep me up into believing that Jurassic World could actually exist? You can't and because of that there isn't a cool moment in this movie that really matters or stands out. There are only 2 or 3 surprises in the movie that aren't in the trailer, and the ""surprises"" are so predictable. There were so many moments where it recycled Spielberg's work. It sounds like that would be cool, but when you see it its so tasteless. Let's have a Jaws moment, let's have the Trex running after the car moment. Does this have anything new to bring to the table? Not that much I'm afraid.I had low expectations for this film going in. I'm the biggest Jurassic Park fan you can meet. I really hoped it would bring me back to the place I loved in any small way it could but it didn't. This movie doesn't take its time showing you the wonders of the Park, it rushes through it like it rushes through everything else.Even Jurassic Park 3 understood how to create suspense. This has none. No sense of how big these animals are either. Remember the famous water rippling in the glass? The feeling this huge thing was coming to get everyone? Nope. Hey cinematographer, ever heard of shadows? You can use them to create fear? Anything? I guess I'm asking for too much.They threw in some nostalgic moments in there but literally stomped all over them. Great, thanks.The only good parts are the CGI and the use of one animatronic dinosaur, glad they figured out that would be effective. The ending is alright but predictable.

That would've been perfect. But, it was a cash cow, and an excellent movie. So, here we are again excited by another Jurassic Park sequel we're crossing our fingers won't suck as much as 2, and then 3 did. This movie left me shaking my head in disappointment several times. At least the bad acting by the dinosaurs is excusable, since they're not real and it's not their fault. But Vincent D'Onofrio, why man, why? Is it money? Is that how you get roped into crap like this? With that terrible ending of the T Rex and Raptor basically head nodding each other, we should've flashed back to JP3 and the Raptor should've just verbally asked the T Rex ""We cool, bro?"".",Jurassic World
1150,joaco1010,Way better than most sequels these days,6,18 June 2015,"Even though I was born in the 90s, I never had any interest in the Jurassic Park films until recently. I don't know if it was the hype for this new film or the constant showings of the previous films on TV that got me to watch the first films. While the first two sequels weren't the best, at all, I really liked the first one. As sequels usually work lately, I wasn't expecting this one to be as good as the one from 1993. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I liked Chris Pratt's character, Owen Grady. He was not the lovable antihero he was in Guardians of the Galaxy, for example. This time there were almost no jokes in his lines, yet how he feels about his raptors is what captivates you since you meet him. He was willing to go inside the cage to save the other staff member, which not only shows how much of a hero he is but also how much he trusts his friends. Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing was a pleasant surprise. I didn't like her at all as Gwen Stacy in Spider-Man 3 (that role was meant for Emma Stone, for sure) and the promotional material didn't make her look like an appealing character. In spite of that, she is the one who gets more developed throughout the film, showing real emotion not only for her family but also for the dinosaurs (the scene with the brachiosaurus was cut short, in my opinion. The sudden change of atmosphere killed the mood). Vincent D'Onofrio is that kind of actor who can get you to HATE the villain he is playing, like it happened with his take on Kingpin in Netflix's Daredevil. I think that shows an incredible skill as an actor, despite the weak script he was given to work with. Vic Hoskin's obsession with turning the raptors into weapons is unclear and his death seemed a little rushed in my opinion. The kids... Well, Ty Simpkins shows again what a charismatic child actor he is. He was lovable as the witty Harley in Iron Man 3, and is now lovable again as Gray Mitchell, an incredibly smart but introverted kid. My real problem is with Nick Robinson's character, Zach Mitchell. It was clear he had a girlfriend, but at the time of saying goodbye he ignored her ""I love you""... Well, he basically ignored everything until his life was in danger. Even though he was taken, he constantly checked every girl in the Park out. He also was ""mean"" to his little brother (quoting his own mom) and broke every rule just to ""seem cool"", which got him and Gray in danger. If this is what the film tried to deliver, both the script and the actor succeeded, as I felt no sympathy whatsoever towards him. The Indomitus Rex was absolutely terrifying and Owen's raptors were surprisingly charming, but who really stole the spotlight in terms of dinosaurs was Rexy. the same T-Rex from the first film. She made clear again who is the real deal in the park. Other notable mention is the vast amount of Easter Eggs referencing the first film. While it's not necessary to watch the first film to understand this one, the film feels entirely different if you catch these Easter Eggs. I left the theater humming John Williams' Jurassic Park theme song, and I am surprised to give this film an even higher rating that the first one because it was the one who got me interested in the franchise. 9/10",Jurassic World
1151,JerryMizner,Jurassic World is decent popcorn entertainment but ultimately feels like wasted potential,6,17 June 2015,"Upon leaving the theater, my reaction to Jurassic World was ""eh it was good enough"". A few days later as I think back to the movie, I remember the action packed finale and some of the great visuals but ultimately there was something lacking from the film, a soul, an identity.Newcomer director Colin Trevorrow proves that he has the ability to to shoot involving action scenes, despite having just one small indie film on his resume. Despite this, sometimes his direction can feel flat, especially in dialogue heavy scenes where he struggles to create dynamism in the interactions of his characters. This leaves the audience uninvested in the intricacies of the story (which is highly straightforward) and simply eager to get to the next dino' showdown.The dinosaur scenes in this film are overall fantastic, and elevate the movie to new heights. I felt like there could have been a greater variety of dinosaurs on offer here, but the ones that are in the film (especially the Mosasaur and I-Rex) deliver the goods.Unlike the original Jurassic Park and to a certain extent The Lost World, Jurassic World presents shallow characters and tries to flesh them out in a cliché manner. For example, the divorce subplot involving the two boys that is brought up once early on in the film, and then never resolved or mentioned following that scene. Another example is the main female character Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is portrayed in a negative and highly stereotypical manner for 3/4 of the movie.Some people have criticized Irfan Khan's character but I thought his small character arc was brilliant. However the military subplot was both unneeded and implausible and should have been scrapped. Chris Pratt was decent as always but wasn't given much to work with here. Ultimately, the movie somewhat succeeds in creating a plausible and believable world, however it would have benefited from some more confident direction and a greater focus on story and characterization over visuals. I don't really have a pressing desire to delve back into the world of the film because it ultimately felt too soulless, especially in comparison to Spielberg's original.The movie has been marketed as an action/thriller film and it achieves this at the expense of the more subtle tension present in previous installments in the series. That said, if you are looking for thrilling popcorn entertainment you will have a good time with this one, just don't expect a classic.6/10",Jurassic World
1152,sapphiremoon09,A visually thrilling cinematic adventure lacking depth and plot.,4,21 June 2015,"First, let me start by saying that this review contains spoilers so Jurassic World virgins, beware.This is the perfect movie to see on a boring afternoon or evening. It is fast paced and thrilling almost from the beginning and it doesn't let up until the very end. However, if you are looking for a movie that will challenge you intellectually and create within you a sense of empathy for the characters this is not the movie for you. The Jurassic Park movies were excellent (excluding, of course, Jurassic Park 3) not only because of the sheer awesomeness of the cinematography and effects, but also because of the superb character development especially in the first and second Jurassic Park movies. The characters were either lovable or hateable and held the viewer's attention even during the slower dialogue scenes. Jurassic World, however, cannot boast the same emotional investment of characters as the other movies can. I know that many people are Chris Pratt fans, which is understandable, but I do not feel that this role suited him well. Yes, he did do a decent job at acting in this film, however, there was something lacking about the way he portrayed his character. I also feel that the romance and overall interactions between Chris and Bryce were forced and unbelievable. Their overall chemistry left much to be desired.Beyond Chris and Bryce, there were other main characters that did not quite catch my attention either, specifically the two boys. I'm not sure whether it was the actors who portrayed the two boys or the characters that they were to portray that got on my nerves. Either way, I sincerely disliked those two characters. The younger brother, perhaps, was reasonably palatable, however, his older brother was obnoxious,immature, disinterested, and a basic know it all, loud mouth, troublemaking teenager. I believe you were supposed to feel scared for as well as sorry for them, but all I felt for them was annoyance.On the plus side, the CGI in this movie is excellent. While I felt that the effects in all of the other Jurassic Park movies were top notch, of course, this movie out shines the effects in the first three. There were scenes where I swear I was gasping from shock and white knuckling my theatre chair, so that says something, right? The dinosaurs, effects, and overall cinematography of this film are captivating and will hold your attention even if the plot does not. As the title for this review suggests, this movie is entertaining and will demand your attention for the duration of the film as long as you do not put too much thought into the lack of plot as well as the poor character development and attempted creation of empathy for said characters. This movie is entertaining while viewing it, but is easily forgotten upon leaving the theater. Amazing CGI, but is overshadowed by the sheer lack of other critical film elements.",Jurassic World

I hope they make another because ill go and see it after this just hope they don't change the director again because he has done a great job with this he hasn't recked it like the third one did.

I was so disappointed to see such fantastic actors do such a poor job, but then again, their characters and the script gave so little to work with. Chris Pratt's potential was absolutely wasted and the love story between Owen and Claire was so unbelievable and forced they literally couldn't find a way to wrap that up without being super awkward.

I can't believe the bond between Owen and them that was developed for a full 15 minutes is broken. In conclusion, generic as they come. Don't waste your time. It's not even close to the originals.",Jurassic World
1156,simon-higgins2,When Dinosaurs Ruled the Box Office!!,8,26 June 2015,"First of all, it needs to be stated that I am a huge fan of all things Dinosaur, ever since i was bought a toy T Rex by my old man at the age of 3. Now 27, I still hold that same fascination, meaning the Jurassic Park franchise is something i have always held dear. My old headmaster always used to say ""Finish Strong"", so before going into detail about the positives about Jurassic World, I want to thrash out a few of the main issues I had with the film. My main negative was the characters themselves were not done anywhere near as much justice as they should. Chris Pratt, though excellent throughout, didn't really have a real story arc to his character. Bryce Dallas-Howards character did have this arc, however it felt very forced and un-natural. The supporting cast should have been given more air-time and fleshed out more, and the less said about the children and their storyline the better...Other irritations include the CGI, at times used well however others it was very patchy and no-where near the ground-breaking levels of the original. There were numerous plot holes, and certain elements that were just plain irritating (the much talked about ""high heeled sprinting"" a major factor). There were also parts to the storyline, such as the ""Raptors for Weapons"" arc, which didn't feel properly fulfilled.Luckily, however, these negatives can be (mostly) swept away by the main reason this film was so enjoyable - the Dinosaurs themselves! The I-Rex was brought to life excellently, and stole every scene she was part of. The Velociraptors were, apart from some questionable CGI at times, great to watch. Supporting Dinosaurs were also very well done, with any dino on dino interaction excellently put together. The nostalgia factor was ever-present throughout the film - some of the moments that hark back to the first film are sublime, and will have you glued to the screen trying to get a peek of what Isla Nublar has become 22 years on from Jurassic Park. To top the film off, the finale was absolutely breathtaking - it packed action, heart and drama into a scene that, being a Dinosaur nut, goes down as one of my favourite movie moments for a long time.For those who are worried that this film is another Jurassic Park 3, your fears are eased. It is not perfect, however I thoroughly enjoyed my hour ride through Jurassic World, and barring this islands existence in real life, cannot wait to revisit again for Jurassic World 2. A message to Spielberg and anyone else involved in this inevitable sequel - please focus on a fewer main, well fleshed out characters, and allow us all more time in the company of these prehistoric beasts!!",Jurassic World

Jurassic World was hopelessly derivative (not because it was based upon the first movies, but because it did nothing original with it's plot or characters). It was contrived, requiring people (most of whom were trained professionals) to do stupid things in order to move the plot along. And worst of all, it was boring. The first two faults might be forgivable-- that last fault is inexcusable and fatal.Please don't waste your time on Jurassic World. It's just not that good.",Jurassic World

Four people contributed to this script and not one noticed the huge hole of which the I. Rex escaped? So the thermal detectors didn't ""see"" the I. Rex because it was cold blooded (which they probably would have discovered when it was born) and it took the time for the girl to get in the car and drive to the facility to realize, ""Oh, we have a tracking system let's see where it is."" To me, that would be the VERY NEXT thing they do when the thermal systems can't ""see"" it!! A better alternative would be for the I. Rex to ""play sick."" Know that the last time it was sick they opened the doors and people came in to treat it. So it ""plays sick,"" they open the doors, and ""Just kidding!"" Then there is the boy who was sad to leave his girlfriend only to be hitting on other women, etc. But those others are just nitpicking.Pay someone a few hundred dollars to fix the ""obvious"" seems like an ""obvious"" thing the studios should invest into, but that's just me.",Jurassic World

Next time, I want the raptors and all the 'baddie' dinosaurs to chomp, stomp and outsmart the stupid humans. Maybe I should have simply turned it off instead of waiting for the Bryce Dallas Howard character (whose name I don't even care to remember) to rub her sore feet and complain about all the pain blisters and the injured calves! That and the idea that somehow it would be reported more people were injured, maimed or killed because of the human stampede.

1160,tomperry9192,Better than expected,8,14 June 2015,"As a Jurassic Park film fan, I was worried that this movie would be another flop like JP3 but it is in fact a very good movie. There are plenty of scares, laughs and the plot isn't too bad either. It will of course never beat JP1 but it certainly rivals JP2. The ranking order for me is now JP1, JP4, JP2 and JP3 are the very bottom. For all those JP fans out there it is well worth the watch. I remember watching JP1 back in 1993 as a child and the film does use a few references to the original. This movie brought back some great nostalgic moments. The acting from the lead role of Owen who is played by Chris Pratt was very good. The CGI is also not too over the top.",Jurassic World

The theme park where the it shows that the future is now, can actually be real and looks like a work in progress. Chris Pratt and Byrce has amazing chemistry to be honest. Although very few scope of romance, but they still clicked it within there trilling adventure fighting for survival from the dinosaurs. the last scene was inevitable as was suggested in the movie poster, but nonetheless was breathtaking. The fight between the hybrid T-rex and the actual one was truly gripping and a blast from the past.",Jurassic World
1162,focus1753,What have they done?,6,13 October 2015,"What was it that made the original two Jurassic Park Movies so good? For me it was the winning combination of memorable characters, amazing special effects and a darker tone than most family movies as especially shown in the second movie which is personally my preferred of the two. The one of these qualities that Jurassic World can claim is the special effects which aren't particularly great if that's all a film can offer. But I'll try and be objective for a moment so you can understand why I didn't like this film. The first thing that put me off about Jurassic world is how the main characters are a 14 year old boy and his 20 year old brother. I assume this has been done in order to try and appeal to the family audience more and as a result the entire tone of the film is brightened. Now as I said before the dark tone of the original two Jurassic park films were a huge part of why they were successful and the same goes for the original book so when I saw that these two children were going to be the main characters I was rather annoyed. My annoyance was well deserved as well as a lot of time in the film is devoted to exploring the brotherly relationship which is neither new or interesting which is also a good way to sum up the two brothers as they are as stereotypical as it gets for a family adventure movie. Talking of non-interesting characters this film suffers a severe lack of truly amazing characters that film did so well. Instead we are stuck with a movie of stereotypes with the two annoying kids, a workaholic family member and a no-nonsense Chris Pratt, all of which are utterly uninspiring. I was especially disappointed by Chris Pratt who I thought I could rely on after his performances in Parks and Recreation and Guardians of the Galaxy but his character was maybe even the most boring being a slightly funnier version of Muldoon from the first film with equal cynicism and less death. The only actually interesting character was Masrani (the new parks owner) played by Irrfan Khan who provides a fresh, comedic and interesting character who I really loved compared to the rest of the boring cast. However, he is so underused in the film appearing for very little of the run time and therefore not making enough impact on the movie. The plots boring as well with the whole story being Chris Pratt and the children's Auntie trying to find them after a dinosaur breaks out. Tis film is everything that's bad about Hollywood its unoriginal, boring and not worthy of the Jurassic name.",Jurassic World
1163,Biologistud2,For about 20 minutes I felt like a 12-year old kid again,9,11 July 2015,"I saw Jurassic Park on my 12th birthday 22 years ago, and it was one of the best cinema experiences of my entire life. As a kid who loves dinosaurs, that was the perfect movie for me. To this date I still love that movie, and always will.For the first 20 minutes, I actually felt like I was that same 12-year old kid, just marveling at the grandeur and awesomeness of this film. I felt the old magic, not as a repeat of the old movie, but as nostalgic bliss. But then it sort of faded away as the plot began. The movie was surprisingly good. I thought it would just be CGI hell, with wooden acting and sloppy pacing, but the movie succeeded in pulling me in over and over. I felt excited and on edge all the time.To be true, the plot is rather lame, and very predictable, but I was able to tune all the inconsistencies out and let myself be carried along. It is a beautiful and fast-paced action-adventure, not an epic love drama. It's dinosaurs! Big ass dinosaurs, and that's why this movie is great.",Jurassic World
1164,xtcrefugee,"All spectacle no substance, watch this for the CGI or not at all",3,13 June 2015,"With the exception of the CGI action sequences (which I'll admit were pretty great), there were failings across the board here. From the paper thin 'plot' (pretty much a rehash of the original movie, although the morality part has been diluted to the point of irrelevance) to the total lack of suspense, and thoroughly wooden acting to boot, this looked like a bad B movie that the studio decided to throw money at because of its name alone. It was almost like a parody of the original, but without any of the charm or intelligence. You can pretty much see the point just over half way through where the director threw in the towel and stopped caring whether there was any internal logical consistency, from that point on the characters seemingly teleport around the island in order to justify the various action scenes.I'll admit I had fallen for the hype a bit and was expecting something at least on par with The Lost World (which is underrated IMHO), but with the exception of my friend's 11 year old every one of us who went to see this came away disappointed.",Jurassic World

In my opinion, that number is way too high for this movie.Second, I was actually excited for this movie and I was hoping for the best. I saw Jurassic Park in theaters when it was first released. I was so amazed that I viewed that film 16 times in just the theater alone. I was younger yes but even watching it now, it still amazes me and even my young children. I will admit that Jurassic World was more entertaining than Jurassic Park 3 but thats really not saying much. Jurassic World was a nice attempt but I just don't understand why Hollywood needs to keep making these movies. Jurassic World was completely unnecessary. No one asked for another Jurassic movie. It was just an attempt to make money on a new generation of children that never had the opportunity to see the original on the big screen. No offense but I would have to assume that children from the ages 16 and younger are the only reason why this movie has more than 7 stars.",Jurassic World
1166,pagan_gal666,IMDb needs a higher rating than 10/10,10,17 June 2015,What to say about this film except this film was amazing. It definitely has the wow factor. Even after all this time you can't help be fascinated over the idea of a dinosaur theme park with real dinosaurs. The special effects actually look like they have brought dinosaurs back just to make this work. The film is fast paced as well as really funny in places. The little nods to the original are fantastic. Can't rate this high enough. It made me and my fiancé jump in places just like the original. Even the kids were better in this one. They actually did stuff. You have to go watch this film. Plus it shows that girls can do anything in high heels! The last main action scene was the pinnacle of the film and worth sitting through just to see the epic fight. Also who doesn't want to see Chris Pratt herding a group of Raptors??,Jurassic World
1167,alexander-rumpf,A nod to the original and even more,9,12 June 2015,"As a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the greatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their names (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting themselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my excitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by the idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the events in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author of the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic is lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its original release, at least it's hidden very deep in the plot. The scientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces of DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain survival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the dinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a reboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the first movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic Park shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1 several times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated original buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van that they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John Hammond told him on his death bed to ""spare no expense"", which was one of the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn't want to commercialize the park too much. That's where the movie starts being perfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt) jokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred species after companies, ""so how about Pepsi-Saurus""? The movie indeed is full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos that are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of the movie? Mainly, I guess, it's meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date experience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by the Parts II&III. It's exciting, contains a little love story, it's got wit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that 22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist and women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most (other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire: man and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That's probably why I'd give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park movie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass will probably never be outperformed. Résumé: Director Colin Trevorrow manages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the original which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of its role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur universe that we, the fans, truly deserved.",Jurassic World
1168,dionkov,The whole movie is based on one dumb moment,4,14 July 2018,"To be clear, I love the franchise, especially the original Jurassic Park. This movie is also great and entertaining but my issue with it is that it is based one very dumb moment. The ""expert"" Owen Grady is taken to check the paddock of the Indominus. The very intelligent dinosaur ""expects"" this and hides its thermal signature. This is all fine. Owen finds the markings on the wall and deducts the asset has escaped. At this point in time logic seems to abandon everybody. Claire drives to the control center while calling them to check the location of the dinosaur, as if that could not have been done from the paddock. Owen decides to enter the paddock with two guards without any confirmation of where the Indominus is. This leads to the escape of the dinosaur as if the cage was made of cheese. Then all sorts of illogical situations pile up one after another. The tracking device seems to have been placed in the one location the Indominus would have been able to claw it out. The team sent to retrieve the asset is sent with toy guns. The boys decide to go on a wild ride among the dinosaurs after receiving the alert that all rides are closed. With all the connected technology, mobile phone coverage seems to be like back in the early 90s. But then when Claire contacts the control center from the original Jurassic Park building right in the middle of nowhere the connectivity is amazing. Claire decides that showing more skin will make her better equipped to handle predators. There are many more facepalm situations but the point is that if Claire had contacted the control center from the paddock as logic dictates, then we would not have had a movie at all.",Jurassic World
1169,xzandria-nicole,"Not Thrilling or Ground Breaking, Yet Still Fun",7,16 June 2015,"If you expect the thrill of the first movie, you'll be disappointed. If you expect ground-breaking CGI, look elsewhere. As has been repeatedly stated, some of the special effects felt low-budget. There were some recycled scenes that paid homage to the other movies in the series, but since they have been done before they lacked the original suspense that caused so many of us to grip our seats in fear and anticipation. Most of the deaths were so outrageous that they were laughable. A lot of the subplots were dropped halfway through or in the middle of the movie. Characters who started off playing a somewhat central role seemed to disappear without us knowing if they survived or not.Overall, the acting wasn't awful. Chris Pratt does a surprisingly excellent job of breaking away from his usual comedic roll into an action star. Bryce Dallas Howard and Infan Khan also play their roles quite well. Everyone else is Meh. But that seems to fit with the sometimes good and sometimes meh script and special effects. So why 7 stars?Because despite how implausible and cheap some of it was, overall it was still a FUN movie that everyone should see once in the theaters. Don't see it expecting to be wowed, see it expecting to be entertained. Then, and only then, you won't be disappointed.",Jurassic World

But they kept getting better and better until I finally thought to myself, ""this might be a good one."" Believe it or not, I was right. The main characters of Claire and Owen, the music by Michael Giacchino, and the concept of an open Dinosaur park really drove the story to its potential as a good sequel. Every movie has their problems, and this one did have a few but not enough to say that I was mislead. The audience and critics may be all over the place with this movie but hey, Haters gonna hate.

1171,kjfkuipers,"Entertaining, brainless action/adventure flick. Pour Jurassic Park movie",6,8 July 2015,"Last evening I finally got to go at the cinema to watch this movie. As a child I was always interested in dinosaurs. I bought dinosaur books, bought dinosaur figures and watched every available cartoon and movie.In 1993 Jurassic Park was released. At first I was a bit reticent to watch the movie as I thought the whole idea of cloning dinosaurs was stupid. But once I saw the movie I was instantly hooked. It made me buy both books Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. While the first movie was great, I found the book even better. I also found The Lost World a great book and had great expectations about the second movie. Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a bit dull. It had some elements it didn't need, and even elements that totally screwed the credibility of the movie, as the gymnastics scene with Kelly and the raptors. In contrast to most people, I fount Jurassic Park 3 even a better movie.However, Jurassic World suffers from the same incredible flaws. At first there is all the high tech stuff in the park itself. As the events are supposed to take place nowadays, why did they have to cram it with high tech monorails, touch screen panels that are prone to failure, holograms and those gyroscopic balls? Speaking of those balls: would a park really let teens roll around freely around animals that weigh tons?Besides that, the original Jurassic Park was kept secret and therefore could be real. Jurassic World instead already had thousands of visitors over the past few year, even needed to come up with a new dinosaur to keep the visitors coming, but no one ever heard of the park.I know this all sounds like nitpicking, but it's these elements that gave Jurassic Park a certain credibility that Jurassic World lacks. Also the ending is way over the top and wouldn't look out of place in a Michael Bay movie, although I have to admit I don't mind watching a Michael Bay movie. The problem is I watch a Michael Bay movie to see some brainless action scenes with spectacular SFX that don't need a intriguing story. I watch a Jurassic Park movie because of the suspense, clever story and feeling this could all be real. This is what Jurassic World is lacking.Finally I have a problem with the characters. Most of them just can't be taken seriously. Masrani (Irrfan Khan) is funny, but seems completely incompetent to run a billions business. And did he really have to fly the chopper himself to hunt down the Indominus Rex because of his instructor suddenly having evacuated the island, without the chopper?I also found Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) trying too hard to play 'the aunt that's too busy to look after her nephews'.Also I can imagine the movie needed a bad guy, but Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Henry Wu (BD Wong) made it sound as if the Indominus Rex escaped on purpose to take control of the park. Instead the movie showed the escape was series of unfortunate events that are very unlikely to happen on purpose.In the end I think Jurassic World was an entertaining blockbuster. I didn't get bored as it was fast paced, like most Hollywood movies nowadays, but I feel like this pace is used to conceal the lacking story. The original Jurassic Park didn't need that pace. It used quiet moments to build up tension and to get to know the characters and care about them.All in all Jurassic World is a decent action/adventure movie with nice FSX, but as a Jurassic Park movie it just isn't that great.Rated as a action/adventure movie I would give it 9 stars. Rated as a Jurassic Park movie I would give it 3 stars.",Jurassic World
1172,c-whitehead97,The Jurassic Park Sequel We Deserve,10,13 June 2015,"This film made be feel like a kid again.

1173,kg-arjun,"Fantastic World, High Intensity",9,11 July 2015,"I'd prefer to look at this movie independent of all the others in the franchise. Yes, it may have been predictable and there may have been logical inaccuracies but hell, I felt so good at the end of the movie and that's all I look for in any movie. First of all, the graphics - just outstanding. When I watched that theme park the only thing I wanted was for it to be real and for my life ambition to go visit that park. It was just surreal. The landscape, the rides, the technology and finally of course, the dinosaurs. It was so sad to see it come crashing down as it inevitably had to. I'd simply watch a movie where the kids just explore the park and go back home safely without incident. But this being Jurassic Park, a dinosaur had to break out and cause chaos. Oh well. Chris Pratt and Bryce do a wonderful job portraying their characters. Pratt playing the logical, cautious, dinosaur tamer and Bryce playing the park's operations manager, very pragmatic yet inexperienced and unaware of the consequences of a dinosaur break- out, hesitating to exterminate the million dollar project but soon deciding to follow Pratt completely when she sees with her own eyes what those beasts are capable of. Overall, I loved them both. Bryce's little moments with Pratt are also very enjoyable to watch. I wasn't too fond of the kids. The younger one typically being the excited, innocent and likable character and the older one being a jackass. The older brother's character was questionable. He seemed so uninterested in the whole thing and yet he wanted to lead himself and his brother into a suicidal mission beyond the boundaries of safety. It almost seemed like he had an ulterior motive but all that proved to be inconsequential towards the end. I loved how dinosaurs were ultimately not the enemy but a monster humanity had created. Recreating nature was not the issue but creating a genetically crazy monster was. Nice way of putting not to mess too much with nature. I also loved how Pratt regains the trust of the raptors and how they fight as a team. Humans and dinosaurs against the genetic beast - it's always heartening to see animals fighting on your side. Yet it was not so illogical that they actual fought for the humans, but just happened to protect them coincidentally. The best part of the movie for me was the entrance of the T-Rex. What's a dinosaur movie without a T-Rex? It was a typical scene of the hero entering in the last moment and saving the day. I love those scenes; they make me feel so alive. Kudos to that water beast too. My god that was one phenomenally big creature.The human villain was a let down but I preferred it this way. It would've been stupid to have him wreak more havoc when lives were already in danger. This movie did not have the chill that the first movie had. The ripple in the glass of water and the missing goat were unbeatable but I'd still rate this higher than the original for the feel good factor at the end. So all in all, this movie is going to let you down if you're someone who focuses too much on story and logic and don't like clichés, but you'll love it if you're someone who just sits back and dives into the show.",Jurassic World

Jurassic World fails miserably. The whole deal is predicated on idiocy and over relies on cheap attempts at recreating scenes from the original, as if going with the same score makes up how dimwitted it is and will in and of itself inspire the same wonder. The effects are garbage, nothing ever actually looks like it's happening in the same space. The characters are fairly cardboard and most conversations feel like they're happening in separate spaces. They wait three quarters of the movie to reveal a detail about the Big Bad New Dinosaur that was obvious from the first time they talked about the thing.

1176,romainbourdon,brought tears to my eyes,9,12 June 2015,"It is true that when the park was shown in its entirety, I had tears in my eyes by how amazing it was (I am aware that this is sad but that's the way I felt). And so it kicked off slowly but after the first 20 minutes have passed, it was getting good and was not a disappointment (for me anyway) the Indominus Rex was terrifying every time you hear the foot steps. A few things I didn't agree with as it went on but still enjoyed it very much. Now for more in depth analysis.***SPOILER WARNING***The music of John Williams is beautiful and is used very well especially in the scene of the reveal of the park showing John Hammonds dream come true. The characters were not as 1 dimensional as everybody claims in my opinion and especially Chris Pratt's character. He is very witty but at the same time quite serious when he needs to be. Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job and the way she played the character felt like a realistic person. Overall the acting was good and I liked the characters in it. Vincent D'onofrio's character is however fairly 1 dimensional and could have used more screen time The plot seemed very simple and an average monster movie at first glance but it is more than that, it has a few unsuspecting twists to it of which I did not suspect. The twist that got me the most is the purpose of the Indominus Rex and how ingen are involved which most haters gloss over as they are too busy hating. The plot of ingen and the Indominus goes like this: Dr.Wu is working under the table for Ingen, so when Simon Misrani comes to him to make a new genetic hybrid for the park, Ingen use this to make an animal that can be used as a living weapon that they can sell to the government, so they create the Indominus that can camouflage to avoid being spotted, be able to modulate its infrared output so it can go undetected by thermal technology, also be able to see thermal radiation to see behind walls and glass and finally be smart so that it can communicate with other Indominus's and raptors. But first they need the green light for the raptors first hence why Chris Pratt's character is hired to train the raptors, so their project for weaponizing dinosaurs is halted for 2 years before the events of Jurassic world. when the Indominus Rex breaks lose, Ingen use this to their advantage and try application to have the raptors kill the Indominus to prove their point, which back fires. Then ingen take Dr.Wu and some embryos to a secure location for him to make more hybrids or animals. I love that plot and you can see this in the movie, hints are sprinkled throughout the movie and it is revealed at the lab scene at the end which shows that ingen was behind the creation of Indominus. I thought the CGI was amazing but I did suspect that there would not be a lot of animatronics sadly. Granted, I couldn't find many scenes were they could have used animatronics. Jurassic world does not show all the dinosaurs that have been displayed on the Jurassic world website which is slightly disappointing but not that important. The indominus Rex is one of the best things in this movie, it is terrifying. Every time I heard the foot stomp, I was getting tense and waiting for it to attack. The whole serial killer animal is a real thing as it was explained by the director that a tiger which was kept in similar conditions as the I.Rex, and so the tiger went on a killing rampage like the I.Rex. Dan Murrell from Screen junkies has called it a plotasaurus but as I have mentioned before it is far from it.The much worried ""tamed"" velociraptors are so amazing and worked well in the context of the movie. I love that in this film they combine elements from what the third JP movie did and combined that with the first JP film Velociraptors. So you should throw those worries away they are not justified.Overall the film was amazing but needed a few adjustments. Take what harsh critics/haters have to say about Jurassic world with a grain of salt because the only thing I see that is justified in their arguments is the 1 dimensional villain. This a must see and a good sequel to Jurassic park. 9/10",Jurassic World
1177,minaluka29,Brilliant,8,7 June 2015,"I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, it's my favorite franchise, my life revolves around it and dinosaurs. I was very nervous for Jurassic World, because it had been so so long since we've seen them back on Isla Nublar (22 years to be exact). This made me go into the film as a mainstream film fan, so I could really tell if this was a good film or not, without being bias. I was amazed by how much this film makes you feel like a kid again, it has the exact amount of nostalgia to please the fans of the franchise and enough new material to appeal to a younger audience who maybe haven't seen the first three films.First of all, the cast which this film possess is used to great effect, with the most notable being Chris Pratt, his character Owen Grady is the perfect blend of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, making him likable and very quirky in how he behaves around his Velociraptors and people in general. Bryce Dallas Howard's character breaks the conventions of a female character in a film of this genre, she takes control of situations and you feel that she isn't a girl to run away from danger...apart from running away from the Indominous Rex, which I don't blame anyone for doing so. The supporting characters in the film also help it to come alive and make you think this is a real park with real lives at risk, especially Vincent D'Onfario in his role, he plays it magnificently and you can feel his tension yourself and finally Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the kids in peril aren't as annoying as Kelly in the lost world, so that's an improvement to take note for.When the first trailer for Jurassic World was released, way back at the end of November 2014, people were starting to get very worried about the effects in this film and how they will improve from the first film, the same with the use of animatronics in this film. Well my friends and fellow fans, the CGI in this film are brilliant to look at, even though some scenes you can tell it is from a computer scene, the rest you couldn't tell the difference, they used the animatronics in scenes where they were necessary which has a lot of sentimental value for the film which was a nice touch. Most people thought in this film the Tyrannosaurus would play a minor role like it did in Jurassic Park 3, but the way they utilize the old girl is brilliant, she is amazing to look at and she even has the scars form the fight with the raptors from the first film, you cannot make the T-Rex have a small role in this film, especially when she's the poster girl for this magnificent franchise. It will be hard to make Jurassic World 2 better than this one, but here is to hoping!",Jurassic World
1178,jacobi_21,Great continuation of the series- looking forward to the next!,9,11 June 2015,"HAving seen all the films and read the books- i was after all the hype expected to be a tad disappointed. I wasn't, I was surprised. They introduced a new Dinosaur much better than the third film, while DBH was good I actually found Chris Pratt better in this film than GOTG. The security lead character was a tad shallow in character, not enough explained about his role and I was confused when InGen came back into the picture as i though Masrani was heading this theme park? Couldn't follow the intro of Ingen really.im sure it was in one of the books a camouflage dinosaur and think this was a great addition to the story.I hope they find a way to carry it on, although the only exit they left to open another film limited a potential future films synopsis/storyline.What I liked- CGI getting much better, clearly some things are obvious. New characters Park was visually amazing New dinosaur was great Made me think i was 11 again seeing the first film at the cinema Music was awesome and never any Dark bits you couldn't see or struggled with.What I didn't like- needs a bit more scary- but i understand was more targeted at kids needed to chain the previous films together to establish itself- while not a continuation and being a separate film to stand on its own- should have established this more? Maybe a trilogy or spent more time on story. The fact that a multi million dollar company like Masarani didn't have adequate response teams for ""assents out of containment"" was a bit of a weak point.(but it is Hollywood) repeat of the kids (nephews) being involved- kind of mirrored the first film storyline a bit and juts swapped the T rex for I-Rex???? Final Battle was epic- communication thing seemed to come from the 3rd film which established the Raptors had a keen sense of communication- i think it went a bit over the top but i did like how the splice of the I rex came into play with this so it had its good points and bad.",Jurassic World
1179,MiscEtc,Engaging Without A Plot,7,15 June 2015,"It was an exhilarating and heart pumping, the movie engages you so much that your eyes are peeled to the screen. There were reenactments that made it seem so familiar. Yet at the same time, there is something amiss. The storyline was lacking, it felt more like a remake than the continuation of the story that was left.I would not say that this movie was a letdown. The graphics were on point, and the actors were engaged. But this movie just let its audience through, without any much of an effort for a plot twist. Everything was too expected that ""I knew it!"" were used more than woah-s and wow-s.",Jurassic World
1180,brianahuggins7,The entire film is worth it just for the finale alone.,8,25 July 2016,"I'll be honest. At the time this movie came out, I'd been waiting for it for fourteen years. These films were an obsession for me growing up, and the moment this film was announced, that obsession returned full force. My excitement was not dissimilar to the excitement that you'd see in your average four year old over- well, whatever it is that four year olds get wildly excited about. I've read the books, I own all the movies, I have an embarrassing number of Jurassic Park toys for a 22 year old. I bought my midnight premiere ticket the moment they were available. I asked off from work to see this months and months in advance; indeed, the moment I was hired for that job.Seeing this movie was wildly important to me.I have no problem seeing that a lot of how people feel about their favorite movies rests distinctly in the arms of nostalgia. I know this is often the case for me, and I can see it most clearly when I rewatch films I love and they don't quite make me feel the way they used to. I still love Jurassic Park. I love The Lost World, and, unlike many, I love Jurassic Park 3. They still, in many ways, make me feel the way I did when I was a child. In other ways, they've lost some of the magic. I think I've just gotten to know them too well to still feel small when watching.Enter Jurassic World.I know that its been some time since the film was released, but its taken me some time to work out my feelings. The very first trailer that was released, I was so excited that I cried, honest to God tears. When the first real clips of the Indominus Rex came to light, I cried again.Because it excited me. Because it made me feel so very small, the way the originals did.The night of the movie, I went with two friends who had never seen any of the Jurassic Park films. All they knew about the movie, they knew from me.I never had any doubts about how good this movie would be, and it lived up to all of my expectations, and more.There were many things I didn't like. I can't say I was wildly fond of the older brother. I can't say that I liked that Claire ended up with Owen by the end of the film. I don't like that the majority of the cast/characters are straight and white. There could have been more female characters. My complaints end there. While the CGI on the velociraptors is subpar, the Indominus is just as well done as the raptors are lacking, and there were very few moments where I was put off by the CGI. Practical is better, yes, but just not always do- able. The originals are a miracle in and of themselves, and this movie shouldn't be wholly judged to their standards.My feelings about this movie can best be summed up with a quote from the film itself, and a quote I felt very strongly about the moment I heard it, because it so aptly described the feeling I'd had about this franchise for years. ""Jurassic World exists to remind us how very small we are."" Watching this movie, I felt like a kid again, overwhelmed and afraid and loving every single second of it. Yes, some of the plot elements are absolutely wild, one hundred percent out there, ""how did they get the okay for this"" madness, but I love it. It's part of what makes it so fun. Within the film itself, it works. Whatever failings the characters have, this movie did, for me, the thing that was most important. It made me feel like a kid again. It made me feel wildly, incredibly small. I realized, from things I knew and from scenes in the trailers, just what was going to happen in the finale moments before it did, and I knew it was going to be absolutely absurd, and I started squealing in my seat and honestly crying because I was so excited. That finale alone was worth the entire film, and Claire is still one of my favorite characters. Her character progression and growth was a pleasant surprise, and my love for her increased tremendously in the buildup to the finale.I went back again the very next day to see this again, and it was just as much fun the second time around.This is not a perfect film. There's no such thing as a perfect film. But it did what a good Jurassic Park entry SHOULD do, and I don't think it was as lesson-less and shallow as many have made it out to be. I knew, going in, almost the entire plot just from guessing, and I'm almost certain that I have the next two films guessed, too, but it's a good movie. If you've still been holding off on seeing this, give it a chance. Let yourself be a kid again. Let Jurassic World remind you just how small we all are.",Jurassic World
1181,EvilDedHed,FINALLY! An extremely worthy successor to the amazing original,9,13 June 2015,"I went into this movie after reading the the reviews on this site (that at the time of reading this mostly seemed to be 4-6 star reviews). The movie's overall rating currently stands at a 7.8/10 which seemed a little on the low side to me. I don't tend to write movie reviews, but it seemed like this movies reviews were all from people that thought that this movie was okay, and probably half appeared to have been written weeks before the movie came out. Let me just say that this movie was an extremely pleasant surprise! I grew up being a huge fan of both of Michael Crichton's genius books, Jurassic Park, and The Lost World. The first movie stuck to the first book pretty well, and like all movies based on the book, the movie was excellent, however did not quite live up to the book. However, for a 2 hour movie, it did do a fantastic job of keeping the tone of the first book. I can not even come close to saying that about the first 2 sequels to Jurassic Park. Both sequels included several elements from the second book, (the third movie included the most subject matter of the second book) it was just a terrible (understatement) execution. I am saddened that Michael Crichton passed before having had a chance to view this movie, because it took a few of the elements from the second book, and created it's very own very different story line. It succeeded in taking some elements of Michael Crichton's genius ideas, and expanded on that creating their very own story line, and they did that WELL. It was an excellent attempt at retaining the tone of the first movie, and successfully paid homage to that movie several times. Without giving away any spoilers, I am seriously happy that they used cool elements from the Lost World book and incorporated them into the main dinosaur in this movie. The CGI was beyond awesome, the story was way better than any movie Michael Bay has ever written, the pacing was excellent, the music was great, the setting/atmosphere was extremely beautiful, and I loved the fact that the dinosaurs were in 3D! The only thing that they possibly could have done a little bit better was character development. As for the actors, I thought the stand out performances were delivered by first and foremost, Chris Pratt as he was amazing (did not expect anything less), Vincent D'Onofrio played a believable antagonist, and Bryce Dallas Howard did well with her role, and was extremely pleasing to look at also. The fact that there was even a bit of comic relief made this movie all the better, as the laughs had were not belly laughs by any stretch, but they also were not cheap or forced. I will say that there was a bit of unexpected on screen chemistry that took place between two of the actors (nothing too substantial) and it did not detract from my enjoyment of the movie. And, if this had been a 3 or 4 hour long movie with uneven pacing, I do believe that they may have been able to do better with character development, however I believe that this would have been at the expense of making a significantly less exciting movie. I will say, especially for a summer blockbuster, I thought that this was an absolutely amazing sequel. I would go and see it again if the opportunity presented itself! All in all, this movie had a little bit of something for everyone, and of course if you have a 7-12 year old child that loves dinosaurs, they will absolutely adore this movie. There is a bit if blood that is shown, and people do get eaten, but the director does a fine job of hiding the super gory stuff by placing objects in the scenes that shielded most of the gore from being shown. To sum up: Storyline/Plot: 8/10 Acting: 8/10 Special Effects: 10/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Photography/Location: 9/10 Overall Rating: 8.6/10 Highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the original Jurassic Park movie.",Jurassic World

1183,was121193,Best I've ever seen,10,14 June 2015,"While it has it's flaws, Jurassic World was defiantly a step forward in the series, possibly being better than the original. It's atmosphere was very emotional, ranging from nostalgic (the music and the Park itself) to sad (the Apatosaurus death and what's left of the Visitor center) and back to nostalgic (the return of Rexy and the ending). The fight in which Rexy, Blue, the Mosasaurus team up against the Indominus Rex was defiantly the highlight for the film, but possibly the best scene in the movie was the ending in which the T. rex surveys the destruction caused by the Indominus and roars to the sun with the Pteranodons flying, symbolizing that the T-Rex is the king of the Dinosaurs. It was almost tear dropping if you think about it. Possibly the most emotional of the movies.",Jurassic World
1184,nhs2007,It defies logic..Sometmes straight foolish but its an action packed mindless fun!!,7,11 June 2015,"‪#‎JurassicWorld‬It's not an adventure like The Lost World JP. A suspense thriller like the Original and neither a survival story like the third film. Jurassic World is an out an out action movie.while there's little character development and lesser logic, It gains high points in milking the ""Nostalgia factor"" and sheer action.The Good bit...Its a fun action movie If you like non-stop action, you will love it! Then there's lots of stupid, illogical but COOL stuff for you to rest your brain. Then there's bits of situational humour here and there which is a nice comic relief.Wonderful musicTaking lots of cues from the Masterpiece of John Williams, Michael Giacchino puts out an exciting score that is different yet familiar and works just right for the film.HomagesThere are lots of little homages to the original which makes it click for the old fans.Disappointing bit...Flat charactersNo highly charismatic ""chao""tician, Cowardly Lawyer, Wise archaeologist or a curious botanist here. Just a one man Army of Chris Pratt and a Resident Evil's Jill Valentine rip-off heroine!! Irrfan Khan has done his part well...but in vein. The two boys didn't get much chance to display anything beyond fear.Unimpressive CGIFor a franchise that defined the CGI Industry, Jurassic World really fails to impress with it's dated CGI. The Dinosaurs actually look worse than they did in the older films. few of the scenes are impressive but others are equally awful.Poor use of animatronicsThere are scenes which could have worked a lot better had they used actual robots instead of just animation. The seam-less blend of CGI and animatronics is what made the dinos in Jurassic park look and act like real animals.Animals...yes. These are animals and they should behave like animals!! (Remember T-REX Biting the car's tyres/Signal post and Raptor going after the refection in the steel?) Well now the dinos have ""evolved"". Raptors are the new dogs! And T-REX doesn't go after the food.Final thoughts...If you're not a particular fan of the series, Or haven't seen the older films. You will love it. But if you're a fan of the series, going in with certain expectations then its a mixed-bag.Watch it in IMAX 3D. (4DX is not needed, nuisance)Rating 7/10",Jurassic World
1185,kitty_897,I really loved this movie,10,17 June 2015,"First off I was around when the first movie hit theaters and I loved it. I however absolute loved this new Jurassic adventure almost as much as the original. Jurassic Park was unique for its time by showing us the most realistic Dinosaurs we had ever seen on screen. The problems people are reporting having with the new Jurassic World are in a way ironically addressed in the movie's plot, ""people aren't impressed by typical dinosaurs anymore; they need something bigger, louder, scarier, and with a lot more teeth."" The film is no longer primarily focused on a select few quirky guest who set out to test an accident waiting to happen called Jurassic Park. This movie is more action, dinosaur oriented and that's what I love about it. While watching the original, more than a few times, I've wished there was just more to the story, more dinosaur interaction but the plot line always seems a bit short to me when talking in terms of event A making it to event B. The original villain/code monkey/douchebag was overly cartoonish and I hated him in all the wrong ways.I can see what they were trying to do with this movie. First off I'm a big fan of animatronics over CGI any day of the week but to get these animals to move at a proper realistic speed it just had to be all done with computers this time around. The CGI was well done in my opinion so I had no real complaints about the dinosaurs being done on a computer. People are complaining there are way too many product placements, well that's because the movie is trying to depict an overly commercialized theme park that really has no care about man or beast as long as the earnings at the end of the day are big enough. So ya I'm not saying it wasn't a strategic money making decision to get a bunch of sponsors but it does make sense to a degree to have all these well know products in a movie were everyone is only concerned about the newest and latest thing.Another complaint was the acting and character development was lacking, yep your right. Many times the characters bordered being too cliché or stereotypes, and more than a few times Owen looked like he was hamming up that ""I'm a bad ass who likes to get dirty in more ways than one and that's why I'm so sexy,"" walk of his, plus the brooding went a bit too far. In the end I ended up feeling for most every person in the movie. So they may not be super deep characters but they are not cardboard either, plus I really enjoyed the relationship between the raptors and Owen (Chris Pratt). Oh, as for Bryce Howard or Clair running the whole movie with high heels on, yep that was a little out there but there were more than a few long distant shots of the actress really having to run with the same high heels on and never missing a beat alongside her sensible shoe wearing costars. That was enough for me to look over that plot hole. Lets all face it this movie was made one for the money/ merchandise, two to bring the concept of Jurassic Park to a new generation (one that values visuals over plot and character development), and three to expand the Jurassic world for the fans who loved the first one and wish it were a real park. I felt like a kid while watching this movie. The way I felt during this movie is the way I would imaging feeling if this were a real park that I was visiting for the first time. It was very entertaining and for me who has seen it all that's saying a lot about this movie. I hope people can give it some slack and except that it's a different take on an old beloved movie from our childhood.",Jurassic World
1186,Big_CIA_Guy,Absolutely sexist and disgusting,1,9 September 2015,"This flick is nothing but a power fantasy for straight, white males to jerk it to. This film repeatedly portrays women as shrewd idiots, all the while placing its white male protagonist in the spotlight. The protagonist is a Gary Stu character who can do no wrong, because that's what white males think about themselves. Rather than go a route where they could've been progressive by including a black or woman hero, they choose to perpetuate the idea that white men are saviors, while women are useless damsels.On top of that, it's obvious that the filmmakers love watching females suffer. Why else would they include the graphic death of a shrewd woman getting her ""comeuppance""? And not only that, why is it played for laughs? It's because the sexist filmmakers seem to have it in their heads that shrewd woman deserve to die.Truly just a disgusting, sexist propaganda piece.",Jurassic World
1187,thealehz0,One word - amazing.,8,13 June 2015,"One word - amazing.This year is very attractive to all, both senior and junior movie- lovers. One movie that brought a lot of attention was the Jurassic World. 14 year after the Jurassic Park III, we got something worth of remembering.First of all, I would like to point out the visual effects. Back in 1993, group of people set a homework for every future movie visual effect. It was incredible to see dinosaurs walking and eating on the big screen, but they did it. And they amazed me again. One thing I was worried about was the original soundtrack, it was there. Acting was nice, Star Lord really did a great job. One thing that I liked the most was the sense of time. I loved how they managed to show a little bit of the original Jurassic Park and the time that passed since then. Henry Wu was there too. I can really feel the spirit of the original movie, but still get something new. For me, that's all that matters. I hope this is the end of the series. The end with the message that no life can be and shouldn't be controlled. 8/10 - Really great movie. Passing on the soul of the original Jurassic Park, one of the best films ever made.",Jurassic World
1188,ratchet123,A Lot Better Than Expected,8,15 July 2015,"I have to admit, when I first seen the trailer for this film, I groaned and rolled my eyes uncontrollably at almost every single moment (the clip of the ""trained"" raptors especially) just like I do with many of what I personally see as pointless reboots, cash cows and unnecessary sequels that seem to have taken over Hollywood in the past few years. Maybe I'm just a boring sceptic or maybe I just expect more from Hollywood and wish it would get back it's golden days (the 90s in my opinion) sooner rather than later. But last night, I thought I'd give this one a shot (mainly because I had a nostalgic craving for man eating dinosaurs feasting on stupid people) and I have to say it was worth it because I left the cinema feeling pleasantly surprised which to be honest, is all I really wanted from this movie.As the movie began with the introduction of the clichéd, vomit inducing suburban family, I feared the worst but after the first ten minutes when that awe inspiring theme tune started up as the camera pans over this all new ultra modern but inevitably doomed park, I couldn't help myself but feel like a little kid again watching the scene from the first movie when you first see the island in all it's mysterious glory. For the next two hours, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The dinosaurs look fantastic, the clichéd characters grew on me, (even the kids, but I mean, what's a Jurassic Park movie without annoying children?) the plot was predictable yet satisfactory even if some scenes did make me roll my eyes and left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth (is it just me or did anyone else almost expect the T-Rex and the raptor to shake hands after tag teaming the Indominus Rex?) and most of all, the battles between the dinosaurs were incredibly well choreographed and were definitely the highlight for me mainly because they returned everyone's favourite man eating monster to it's former glory after it was disgracefully humiliated in that god awful JP3.So all in all, aside from the forced romances, cheesy scenes, too many one liners, half assed character development and lack of Jeff Goldblum, I think it was a great way to spend two hours, particularly if you watch it without comparing it too much to the first two movies. I give it a solid 7/10.",Jurassic World
1189,roman-arbisi,"Thrilling, engaging, intense and violent, Jurassic World delivers on all cylinders",8,13 June 2015,"DINO-SAURS! 'Jurassic World' starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard is everything I hoped it would be and then some. As a massive fan of the original 'Jurassic Park' directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, I was hoping that 'Jurassic World' would pay great homage to the original while still being it's own type of movie, and it did. Director Colin Trevorrow managed to make an awesome monster movie that isn't as great as the original but an awesome monster movie that is sure to be one of this summer's best offers. 'Jurassic World' is full of awesome moments, lots of violence, a surprising amount of blood spilled, loads of intense action and thrills, a terrifying monster that imposes a huge threat, and a badass dinosaur fight that we've been waiting YEARS to see. Although this film has a ton of positives, there are a few minor flaws and problems I had early on in the film that grew on me throughout. Bryce Dallas Howard's performance as Aunt Claire early on bored me to tears, she was lifeless and I felt NO attachment to her character early on, BUT things change. The first 30 minutes of this film do a great job of setting up future events but it all kind of bores me, BUT things change. During the beginning stages of 'Jurassic World' I started preparing myself for a let down, but right at that half hour mark, I was sucked in and I couldn't leave. Howard got better, the movie got better, the dialogue got better, the movie got intense and scary, and 'Jurassic World' kept me on the edge of my seat for an entire hour and a half, not a single dull moment from then on. Basically, the film starts shaky but it revs up quick and then it's all great from then on. One major complaint I keep seeing is that Pratt never feels like the lead, but does he need to? When you re-watch 'Jurassic Park' is Alan Grant really the lead? I don't think so. It's the ensemble that brought JP together and it's the ensemble in JW that reminded me that much of the original. No one needs to be a lead in this type of movie, it doesn't require one and frankly if it did have one MAJOR lead I'd have to say that the film would fall flat right on it's face. Because then you get one main focus and we only see small portions of a ginormous park. Having an ensemble allows us to see the park almost in an entirety without following the same character we've been with for the past half hour. *semi-rant over*Let's talk the Indominus Rex real quick. Terrifying, scary, badass, smart, and threatening to thousands. The I-Rex BLEW ME AWAY! Every scene that includes the I-Rex had me clenching my fists until my knuckles turned white. What has made the I-Rex standout from any other typical monster or dino, is that it is smart and it knows what it's doing and how it's going to do it. The elements included in the I-Rex and how it came to be was genius storytelling and it makes sense. The thing is a beast, and a worthy ""villain"". I kind of wish the reveal of the dino would've been on the T-Rex level from JP, but that's a nitpick, the first sequence with the I- Rex was VERY well done. In conclusion, 'Jurassic World' is everything that I was hoping it would be and then some. The movie is exciting, badass, action packed, hilarious, fun, blood spattering, dinosaur roaring, tension filled, and a damn good time at the movies this summer. If you're expecting this movie to be better than the original, please don't, it'll ruin your experience. If you're expecting this move to be Oscar-worthy, please don't, it'll ruin your experience. Have fun with it, enjoy dinosaurs, enjoy the tension, and enjoy the visit to the park that was once envisioned by Dr. Hammond.",Jurassic World
1190,jehuty107,Average,6,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World reminds me of Godzilla 2014, a movie where we want to see the title non human character but instead the focus is shifted to the humans for the majority of the movie. I disliked that a good chunk of time it focused entirety on the the back story of the 2 children before we ever get to see the park and dinosaurs. These children become the largest point in the movie and I couldn't help myself in wishing they did get eaten by the I-Rex. They are the personification of Hamon's 2 grandchildren, except with more back story, from the 1st movie and it shows with the events that happen throughout the movie. The movie itself is better than Jurassic Park 3 but it is a modern telling of the original Jurassic Park. With just a couple new concepts thrown in, any viewer that has seen the original can see the resemblance. The ending is almost a copy of Jurassic Park's ending and it could have been so much more but it failed at being original, relying on what worked on Jurassic Park and trying to redo it but failing.TLDR: This movie is just Jurassic Park with modern concepts and jump scares. This movie could have been much more but the script went with what has worked in the past and had little innovation.",Jurassic World

1192,ingridnya-169-851414,Movie can't decide if it wants to be funny or serious,3,19 May 2018,"Claire is one of those too stupid to live heroine who runs a forest park in high heels and ridiculous white outfits. I don't care what you say, you can't run in high heels for one hour like she spends her time doing in the movie. Not only that, she runs as fast as Owen Grady, ex-navy outfitted in boots. She seems to be in charge of the park, but faced with a monster threatening 20 000 people she leaves everything to go and rescue 2 people (She doesn't have ANY survival skills... And Nonooo... why would she think to take one second to put on boots or get any weapon)A park of that size without proper evacuation procedures wouldn't be allowed to exist. And that in the direst situations the genetist who created the monster still doesn't want to say what's in that dinosaur so that people can assess what it can do and take the necessary measures is just plain ridiculous. Given the size of the massacre, for me the overall tone of the movie was not appropriate at all. And for the person in charge to get out scots free is... not right.3 stars is for Chris Pratt and Omar Sy (I am just biased I like the french actor), and for the monster dinosaur who was the real star of the movie.",Jurassic World
1193,FunnyFruits,This is a review on Jurassic World by a recent viewer,7,12 June 2015,I have just seen the newly released Jurassic World on Friday 12th June 2015 and I must say that I am quite surprised. My original thoughts before I had seen the movie where to write it off as the worst in the Jurassic Park series. I was going to get through the first hour and see how it was and then make up my mind leave in disgust or stay and watch the dribble because I paid for it. If it was awful I would have come home rated it a 2/10 and written it off using all the curses I could think of. However I was hugely surprised by the movie it was not like I had thought. I admit it was not the best movie I have seen nor the worst. The movie had it's up downs and wronged scenes and facts but it was still enjoyable. There was some problems with the actual dinosaurs displayed which got the slight paleontology side of me annoyed but I looked past those minor problems. Due to this being my first review I am not sure how long these can go on for however I shall admit I am not the best when it comes to this. So I shall keep it short and try and cover some important factors and some of my own personal factors. All of the Jurassic Park movies made where great some not being as good as the previous and others being the best of them all. In my personal view the best Jurassic Park movie and perhaps the dinosaur movie ever made was Jurassic Park 1993 Steven Spielberg. Them it went to the Lost World and then Jurassic Park 3. All the Jurassic park movies after the first try to be as good as the first or even better sadly no of them came close. However this does not mean they are bad they were all good in their own ways. This new Jurassic world tried to keep up with the first and best dinosaur movie but everyone I knew and myself new it would not. The movie itself was not like the of Jurassic parks as I found there too be too much violence and the odd bit of romance. It did not ruin the movie but made it less enjoyable. Jurassic World in my opinion ranks at the same level of Jurassic park 3 making it not the best Jurassic park film but it is not the worst. For this misspelling and grammatically wrong reviewer I can say that if anyone who is like me and said that this new movie will be awful before viewing it I would recommend you give it a go. It may not be like the Jurassic park you know and love but it is different and still keeps some of the old traits. Jurassic world is good for the fourth installment dinosaurs but if a fifth where to be made I will be hard to like. The movie ended not in the best ways for a Jurassic park movie but it made out that the dinosaurs will live on in a free island. Like the current Jurassic park movies I have seen on other reviews that after the first it goes downhill so I hope that Jurassic World does not follow the old steps. If so it would be fun to watch and rate again. Too close this short review would like to say well done director on making and enjoyable movie. It has been a pleasure to view the movie and I say that if you haven't seen the movie it would be a fun trip to see. Thank if you were able to read this with no problems,Jurassic World
1194,owlman22,Like Wow!,9,17 June 2015,"I did not know what to expect out of this movie. Sequels are so often disappointing. That was not the case for this movie. It was riveting for the entire 2 hours of the movie, and the special effects were flawless to my eyes. It was exciting, but still had sufficient emotional pathos to really get you involved. I didn't care initially for the cool, collected manager of the park, but she definitely grew on me as the movie progressed. Chris Pratt was excellent in his role. This is the first time I've really seen him in a role, and I think we will be seeing a lot more of him. The nephews were cast beautifully too. Great movie and worthy of the Spielberg franchise!",Jurassic World
1195,devinpierce32,Jurassic world!!!,7,9 July 2015,"Jurassic world was way better than I expected it to be. I'm not sure if it lives up to the Jurassic park but it defiantly was better than Jurassic park 2 and 3. Jurassic world visual effects were just amazing to watch. The action sequences were really good. I think Own (Chris Pratt) acted very well for the leading actor, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) did OK but she was not like wow she did a great job, the kids, gray (Ty Simpkins) and zach (Nick Robinson) actually were some what entertaining to watch, there were parts that the acting was not always the greatest but it really did not bother me. I feel like Jurassic Park was just an original movie and everything about it was really good, the acting, the visual effects, the storyline, Steven Spielberg as the director did a great job, but for this new installment Jurassic world, had decent acting, amazing cgi visual effects, the storyline to me wasn't really to bad but people can argue otherwise, and I think the new director Colin Trevorrow did a great job and everything came together good. The ending to me was awesome, I honestly did not expect that the ending would be like that but it was awesome, I like the fact that they actually killed some people off. Maybe a rated R version of this movie would have been better but i recommend going to see this movie, it was defiantly worth it.",Jurassic World
1196,iloveyou-trejo,Amazing,10,14 June 2015,"I loved it. It was incredible, at first I was like thinking it was way to hyped up but honestly worth watching. by the way, not talking about the movie at all, I just came from Chris Pratt.No, but still, I'm not a fan of movies like thess but it was really good. It was a thriller the whole ride, personally didn't think it was boring at any point, the plot was consistent, I love the emotional bond between blue and Owen as well, I thought it made the movie better on a whole another level. It was really good, I would totally recommended.Came for Chris Pratt, left with something more.11/10 in my opinion, If you're a person like me who's skeptical about it, just give it a shot. I assure you won't regret it/",Jurassic World
1197,Blakemore-jb,The film series has returned with a bang!,10,12 June 2015,"I don't do many reviews on here from the amount of movies I watch, simply because not many films have impressed me that much but I will get to that soon.Basic Storyline-Two boys (Zach and Gray) get an exciting vacation to the new Jurassic World located at Isla Nublar, 22 Years after Jurassic Park, there Aunt Claire works at Jurassic World and was supposed to stay with the boys for there vacation, the boys go round the park and see all the rides and attractions meanwhile Owen (Chris Pratt), is training four Raptors so they could be prepared for being a new attraction in the park, also in another part of the park, there is newly designed dinosaur which is mixed species of a T-Rex and something else I shall not say, something occurs during the movie which causes this dinosaur to escape and cause havoc around the Island, the rest I will leave to you guys to watch as I do not want to spoil a thing.What I Thought-Well, I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park Series and I have to be honest, I did not expect a great amount from this movie as I thought it could not follow the previous movie, especially the first Jurassic Park. I was very wrong... this film held a great amount of action and surprises, I could not even blink during this film in case I missed something, it has to be the most exciting and thrilling film I have ever seen and people will disagree with me when I say I think it is better than Jurassic Park, it felt like we really saw the sights of the island in much more detail and the story was absolutely brilliant. I do think they should end it there for the Jurassic Series as this film makes an excellent end to an excellent series. Well Done to Colin Trevorrow for directing such an excellent film. Cannot wait until this is on Blu Ray because I just want to watch it again!10/10, Stunning Movie.",Jurassic World
1198,laurisalminen,"Blockbuster material, could have been better",7,30 June 2015,"Second best Jurassic Park movie.The movie looked a bit too plastic for my taste. They used some practical effects also which was nice touch. The lead characters handled the script well and gave good performances. Dinos were lifelike and created with great care and detail. Sound effects were effective and the chair in cinema rumbled accordingly :-) Now the bad. Too many dinosaurs! The scene with those flying dinos was something I did not like. Too long and distracting scene. Also the end fight with Indominus, T-Rex And Raptors was a bit too much popcorn for my taste. I also felt the movie was bit too long.For me it is enough to see this movie once. Is was good entertainment but I do not need to view it again so its not a classic in my books. I saw T5 a day before and liked it better but hey, thats my opinion.",Jurassic World
1199,ebony_rose_byrne,Very fun to watch 10/10 recommend to see.,10,13 June 2015,"Loved it. I thought the movie was entertaining and thrilling. Stuck to the original recipe that made the first Jurassic Park movie so good, though they spiced it up with new features. E.I the Raptor's and the new park toys etc. Chris Pratt was amazing in this. Their choice of actor was perfect and it makes me very enthused to see any new movies he will be apart of. The children cast was also incredible. Vincent Denofrio, once again the creep but of course is excellent at it. His character was a little one dimensional though. All-in-all I enjoyed the jump scares and the tense atmosphere the movie held and the fun vibrant feel throughout the movie. Very fun to watch 10/10 recommend to see.",Jurassic World
1200,azguys,I Cannot believe how much money this nightmare mess made!,2,1 July 2015,"Wow where do i begin with this over hyped ridiculous overdone and overrated piece of predictable computer enhanced garbage? The only decent one was the first one. The others were just for the money. First off the plot was laughable. Second the acting was so so. Still hungry for an old fashion fun dinosaur type movie. This wasn't even close. The constant idiot plots as well made you wonder who would do that in even a film situation? I give kudos to the advertising and hype firms to get this garbage sold opening weekend! Great job on that! What a horrible terrible recycled mess that took up a few hours of our life that we can never get back! Who can i sue to get our money back? Not even a fun movie. Just a bunch of over kill plot and special effects that looked as fake as the acting did! If you have not seen this mess,please save your hard earned money and go out to dinner instead or see anything instead of this mess!",Jurassic World
1201,mhjilani,Entertaining but too predictable:,6,5 December 2015,"This is a good popcorn, blockbuster flick along the same vein as the Michael Bay Transformers movies, but don't expect a great plot. In fact, if you've seen the original 1994 Jurassic Park (and who hasn't), then you by and large know what's going to happen already - park opens, everything is going fine, something goes wrong, kids get stuck in a 'vehicle', they get rescued, and then the dinosaurs take care of business at the end while the good guys escape off the island. And of course, someone part of the system (in this case, the actor who plays Kingpin from Daredevil) is self-serving and messes everything up by going off of protocol.The CGI is excellent and I thought Chris Pratt did a good job as lead - he was definitely a bad ass. I thought the aunt who was supposed to take care of the kids was annoying as hell though. She was uptight and finally loosened up as the movie went on.A couple of parts were kind of ridiculous, especially the Pterodactyls attacking the mass of park-goers stuck in the main area and some PDA at inopportune moments when their main concern should have been getting the hell out of there.Overall it was pretty entertaining, but they really overdid playing the same scenes from the first movie (down to the pacing and position of the dinosaurs themselves). I don't see why this is rated as high as it is or why it's the 3rd highest grossing movie of all time, but it is what it is. Bottom line is grab your popcorn, watch some cool dinosaurs fight each other, and enjoy the movie but don't expect a good story - way too predictable.",Jurassic World
1202,ricky_lowry,It's the 21st century after all.,5,16 June 2015,"I was just 3 years old when Jurassic Park was released and Jurassic park is still my favorite film. Although, I came into the theater with a open mind. However it's inevitable that films today just aren't made with the same quality. Films today are marketed purely for profit and they prey on those enjoy who enjoy loud mindless action. With that being said, it's time to review the film. I was impressed with how the park was presented, the island was beyond beautiful. The raptors in my opinion were the stars of the film. They looked awesome and were very realistic. The acting however was below average and the characters just felt empty, and left no lasting impression on you. The cgi in this film was very good, but several scenes were noticeably computer generated. The first film was so great because they blended cgi and robotics so smoothly. Jurassic World was full blown computer dinosaurs. Overall Jurassic World did incorporate some very similar shots that brought you back to the first film. For example Owen guarding Claire, Zach and Gray when the raptors were surrounding them, much like Dr. Grant was guarding Ellie, Tim and Lex in the first film. There were several other shots very familiar to the first film. In my opinion the ending was rushed and thrown together,in fact the whole film felt rushed. With eleven years in between films, I believe they COULD have made a truly awe inspiring original film to revamp the series. To conclude, I wasn't greatly impressed, but then again we are talking about the 21st century, a time when MOST films are based on profit rather than the love of film making.",Jurassic World
1203,bartspain,Business as usual,2,27 February 2016,"Instead of spending so much money on special effects (that after all are only effects nothing else) spend more time and money in writing a good and descent screenplay. It is just another fast-food movie without any flavor. Some TV shows are far more better. How can the excellent actor Vincent D'Onofrio step in such a trap. I used to enjoy his role in Law & Order. But here he was probably blinded with a nice pay-check, I don't blame him for that. I only hope to see him back in really good movies or TV shows with better stories. In the mean time, check documentaries about Jurassic eras and so on, they are probably much more involving then this bland non-inspiring story.",Jurassic World
1204,wernB,An OK movie with no intentions whatsoever,7,15 June 2015,"Contains Spoilers and bad English.I love the original Film, was turned off by the following two, then I guess you can say time heal wounds and was eagerly awaiting the new one. Especially as I heard that they learned from their mistakes and don't just shoot it to purely make money (of course they want to make money.. no problem with that) as there was enough time for concept, obviously. But quite the contrary is the case.The movie presents itself as a capitalistic warning sign. The park is running and business is good, yet future is uncertain, as quoted quite often, and so they already planned the next excitement: bigger, scarier, more teeth: the Indominus Rex, a genetic carpet of mixed up species. This dinosaur is of course fatal to the parks existence. Unreflected, unethical marketing took its toll and destroyed the company. That's the base line of philosophy in the film.Problem is, the filmmakers applied the same concept of marketing the movie to us: we see a giant fish-dinosaur in the trailer.. a new"" dinosaur is mentioned etc As if we constantly needed something bigger to go and see the movie. This schizophrenic approach, criticizing one thing and on the other hand doing it, is like a red line throughout the movie. The main woman is constantly being laughed at, for her high heels, for her outfit, for her stupidity and yet it is the screen writers who wrote that. Why don't you just come up with a cool character and role for the leading woman? She is absolutely useless until the very last moment. Product placement is staged to be clearly seen, as a critical side kick to the industry but surely as hell they got a ton of money from those brands. It feels like the movie wants everyone to be pleased but is in reality just scurrying from one hot topic to another by hoping that no one noticed its fake nature.Jurassic Park, and I mean all of the previous three films were never made to be funny movies. Well, I don't want to say Jurassic World is a comedy, I mean rather the line of taking itself not serious enough is crossed way too often. they got 20k people on that island, and there is an insane smart ass killing machine on the run. What you gotto do? Of course: you send a bunch of dudes with electro sticks to melee fight it. They want to have it alive, I get that, but even in the the second movie (I guess?) there was a hunter who single handedly took out an tyrannosaurus. These decisions accompanied with superior"" equipment, I mean.. it's 22 years after the first park, you could think they had planned things and events that might happen more thoroughly.. these decisions make the whole scenario appear completely unrealistic.I don't really felt the Jurassic Park spirit. You see resemblances en mass.. and I mean really en mass.. the gadgets of the first movie, the two kids in the car scene, familiar line of texts, familiar shots etc. but in the end, it's just the sum of its parts and not more :(",Jurassic World

1206,The_Pale_Emperor,Dinosaurs are real again.,8,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World Rating: Must see. Let me start off by giving some perspective, Jurassic Park was the film that made me go ""I want to make movies"" that film took me to a place I never thought could be witnessed by anyone. Dinosaurs were real, flesh and blood. Tooth and jaw. It was glorious and that film is the sole reason I want to be a film maker. Skip to Jurassic Park 3, I'm sitting in the cinema not expecting much but being hopeful nonetheless because this franchise is close to my heart. The opening of that film set the tone for the film and that tone was....Excrement. Anyways lets get to Jurassic World, this film I went in with even lower expectations in fact I was almost certain I was going to hate this film because each sequel after the first film never justified themselves for being a sequel. But my opinion slowly changed. For one the film was sold out. I have never been to a sold out film ever. Not only that but the line wrapped around the inside of the Cinema towards the ticket booth. I was flabbergasted. Once me and my friends got our seats we just were completely taken away with the whole situation. I couldn't believe this many people were here wanting to see this film. Once it began all my reservations were gone. I became 6 years old again and I lost my composure.This film is the first film I can say that is worthy of being called a sequel. It goes places that are familiar but new at the same time and it respects its heritage, whereas JP3 shat on the heritage completely. I don't want to give away anything at all but I will say this. If you loved the ending sequence of Jurassic Park you're gonna love this one even more. It blows that scene out of the water...literally. Anyways go see it.",Jurassic World
1207,josh-69687,Second Best In Series,10,14 June 2015,"We all knew Jurassic World wouldn't compare to the very first and very best Jurassic Park, but that doesn't take away the fact that this installment is amazing.Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World is a re-imagined version of the original resort. The visitor rates are declining, and the only option to increase them is to design their own dinosaur; the Indominus Rex, a decision that the InGen team would soon regret. The side-plot is fairly suitable to the movie, as a worker at the resort secretly hatches a plot to turn the inhabitants into living bio-weapons, but takes away a sense of realism.The movie itself takes a seemingly long time for the main plot line to develop, but when it does, you are in for a roller-coaster ride of action. I will not go into further detail as it will reveal the events, but for a movie this fantastic, it was very hard not to.CGI however is relied on heavily when it comes to the dinosaurs. When you compare them to the original, they all look much more realistic due to the use of mechanical devices. However, there are moments when you forget the Dino's are computer animated, and they truly do look realistic.One last note to the people wishing to see this movie, please take into account that there are some moments that younger children may find disturbing, as there are plenty of bloody moments.To conclude, Jurassic World is perhaps one of the films of the year, but I wouldn't expect it to win many academy awards, however I would truly recommend this to fans of the original.",Jurassic World
1208,adventuremaster,Better than the first,10,17 June 2015,"I loved this movie, I saw it opening night. First of the characters are good. Chris Pratt and everyone else did a wonderful job. The dinosaurs look awesome, in fact they look better at the end, you can tell they wanted to put a lot more effort in the 2nd half of this movie and that's not a bad thing. They make it very emotional. That seen with the dinosaur dying made me tear up. The ending is the best ending to any movie ever. When the Tyrannosaurus Rex came out I was so happy and when Blue saved him that also made me happy. When the giant sea monster killed the bad dinosaur, I started clapping and everyone in the theater did too. So now I have a poster on my wall, the entire soundtrack on my computer(my the way, the score's awesome) and have seen it twice already and am hopefully going to see this masterpiece again.",Jurassic World

But this movie. By god. It was amazing. I just saw it and I had to write a review and I even had to look up movie that came out this year for my list of things I've seen. Jurassic World will just make you completely forget all the movies you saw including the OK-good ones like avengers and mocking jay. This movie completely makes all the other movies look like sh*t honestly. It was the best movie I've seen since probably the last Harry Potter, Inception, or the dark knight.

1210,martinharveyspam,extinct,5,12 June 2015,"Another over-hyped film with good trailers that make you want to go and pay your hard earned cash to watch. Until the 'action' starts this is painfully dull filling in the back story of what's happened since the first movie, introducing the new stars including the obligatory couple of slightly annoying children. When the action does start, it's pretty much as you'd expect, a couple of different dinosaurs to the usual suspects, but other than that, you know exactly what you're getting and where you're going. Chris Pratt is his usual slightly goofy self and is easy to watch and there are a couple of humorous moments, and some nice nods to the original. Surely now this must be the end of the line, and evolution will deem this to be extinct......",Jurassic World
1211,cvamsikrishnac,excellent..........that is excellent..,10,12 June 2015,"The movie was really beautiful..........the main role played by chris pratt was wonderful.......ending was really perfect.........that two brothers are really superb.........overall awesome movie...compared to beginning ,the ending scenes were more awesome........owen played a major role in this movie. Now we have part 4, which is called ""Jurassic World"" and while it's a major league improvement over the dismal ""Jurassic Park 3"", its still can't live up to the quality of what Spielberg achieved with the work he did with the first two Jurassic Park films ( The original and it's sequel ""The Lost World"".) This film takes place 22 years after the original and Jurassic World is fully operational but the mystic of dinosaurs has worn off and the resort needs a new attraction to bring in new customers. So they create a new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex, a leaner, meaner animal that is made to bring in and wow the crowds. At this point of the film for me when they introduce this monster, I can hear what Jurassic Park's mainstay Ian Malcolm would have said during this moment and it would not have been kind. If you remember the character of Ian Malcolm (played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum) he's pretty much the best character in the Jurassic Park films. The reason being is the fact that he not only represented what the audience was thinking during the films ( Well, the first two movies, not the god awful 3rd one) but was the voice of sarcastic reason and reality to John Hammond's flights of fancy. Too bad he's not around in this movie because he would be pretty much putting down almost every character in this film for their ignorance and stupidity, which was the audience's reaction in my theater through out this entire duration of the film. Chris Pratt plays pretty much the only likable character in the entire film and pretty much the only character with some brains in his head. That's a good thing considering that we would have no one to root for to at least survive the massacre that comes when the Indominus Rex finally and predictably goes on it's killing rampage. Bryce Dallas Howard really does not have much to do other than be surprised by her character's stupidity, which is a shame cause she really is a good actress and Vincent D""Onofrio is given a one note role which is a crime cause he's a damn fine actor. Throw in two of the most annoying kids ever to be stranded on a dinosaur resort ( (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) and you have a cast of characters who almost deserves to be dino chow. Despite the dumb characters and the leaps in logic and common sense, the movie does work as a entertaining time waster. There are some pockets of excitement to be had and the climax really does deliver the goods but this is all this film is about. It's really a monster movie, not a Jurassic Park film and while Chris Pratt gives us the only character in the film to root for, not even he can cover up the film's huge mistakes in story, logic and characterization.",Jurassic World
1212,mobey-99377,"More ""monster"" than ""Jurassic""",8,14 June 2015,"Thought I'd be brave and watch this one in 3D and even though I had a dizzy spell for a while afterwards, it was ""jurassic world"" so why complain? The 3D looked good (even better if I could focus) and the film was also good but more of a monster feature than a true ""jurassic park"" sequel. Like the character of Ian Malcom said in ""the lost world"";You're making all new mistakesI think that this sums up the movie somewhat as it is more or less the same ""tried and tested"" story of the prequels but don't be fooled into thinking that it is a bad movie...quite the opposite actually. It is a good watch and the excellent CGI effects do not distract from the movie. There are no return appearances of the original cast members (with the exception of BD Wong who appears for brief moments) which is a shame as I was expecting surprise appearances. Although this is a very predictable film it is a great deal better than the third film in the series. All in all as a standard creature feature this movie works really well but as a ""jurassic"" sequel...not so good. It will however give you your money's worth if you are looking for dinosaurs, collateral damage and the occasional person being killed for good measure. If you enjoyed the previous films in the trilogy then this is a no brainer for you but my advise is that go see it as a creature feature and you might enjoy it that much more.",Jurassic World
1213,robingoossens,How to tame your raptor,10,15 June 2015,"I just recently watched the movie Jurassic World and needless to say, it was EXCELLENT...From the beginning to the end, there was enough action, and surprisingly, a lot of humor to find in between the action scenes. There is some gore to be found in the movie (It is a horror genre with Dino's, after all...) but there wasn't all too much graphic scenes. You could easily take your children to the movie without having to worry about blood or other gruesome things for your kids to see (WARNING: You will see some people got eaten, but as I just mentioned, NO BLOOD)The story takes place on isla Nublar, in Costa Rica. None of the previous characters are involved in this film seeing as how John Hammond has passed away and the previous characters have nothing to do with this movie. However, the new introductions bring a few fresh faces to the genre and the story divides screen time evenly between the main characters so the movie isn't focused on 1 specific character.If you are a fan from Jurassic Park or any Dino-themed movie, this is definitely for you.",Jurassic World

I wanted more dinosaur, more fighting, more eating people. Spoiler? Don't know if it would be or not. Why is the lady dressed in all white in heels running around a jungle. She turns from a wimp into a butt kicking wanna be hero. I kept thinking King Kong, big monster trying to get the lady he liked or disliked in this case.

1215,youmedead,People say this is bad? That it is 'better' than Jurassic Park III?,8,16 June 2015,"I will say this once, and only once... This movie was great, and it was not just another attempt to make money.I just saw it and I didn't know what to expect. Mostly because almost everyone said it was a terrible movie. I disagree.It was better than Jurassic Park III, but when I do, I am not criticizing that movie. It was great as well. My thoughts are that everyone thinks that if it is not as good as the first film, it is not worthy of a decent rating. Also that if not perfect, it is a bad movie. Again, I disagree. Of course it has problems. How many movies are there that are spot on perfect. No, it is NOT perfect. That doesn't mean you give it a terrible review and rating. If the raptors changing sides so quickly is your problem with the movie, you are right. That doesn't make sense. Don't act like this ruined the movie.If you think they could have picked better actors, I don't see your problem with the actors they already had. They were fine. No, they didn't put Samuel L. Jackson or Morgan Freeman in this movie. Who cares?Another thing I see is that the script was fine. I saw nothing in it to make this a bad movie. No, it wasn't perfect. Nothing is.The movie wasn't as good as the first Jurassic Park, but it was better than Jurassic Park III, and phenomenally better than the second installment, The Lost World.",Jurassic World
1216,ilearnall,Nowhere near as good...,3,16 June 2015,"While Chris Pratt is very nice arm candy for a lady. His acting is not so sweet, he can't act, that is. No surprises, certainly not any of the tension that the original movie had or even the second installment. Didn't really care about the actors, not invested in them. One of the two best parts was the music and I won't reveal the other as it would be a spoiler. Please leave the 90's movies in the 90's! The background was neat too. I didn't understand why so many parents were bringing their little children to this movie. I mean you can do what you want but at least I won't have to listen to screaming in the middle of the night when the kids wake up from a nightmare. Take care guys!",Jurassic World
1217,cathmontague,FAIL as worst Movie Ever .. that is Worst Jurassic Movie,1,17 June 2015,"This movie is a complete FAIL. The worst Jurassic movie made out of them all, this film has no real movie stars in it to capture your attention, no serious and logical plot, on all levels, unbelievable characters etc.. Where do I start, firstly the opening scenes made no sense what so ever, the two nephews created a disconnect the whole movie, including their strange, bad and unrealistic choices in the film. The fact that there were over 20,000 people (mainly tourists) on the island, there was no real 'owner/CEO' of the park, no clear protagonist worthy of this title, the hunky male lead, well who is he? He is generic looking, all I could think of was they plucked him from a Vegas strippers show for the role. His training antics! Please! There was no Business Contingency Plan when the park had dinosaur issues, the fact that no scientist monitored the clones dinosaurs they created! Finally... don't get me started on that White suit and high heals... with the addition of Red hair, the whole movie it made me think of that crazy witch Julia Gillard, the worst Australian Prime Minister ever, and how she stuffed up Australian Politics. Strange but true.",Jurassic World
1218,josephhowarth,Just Not Very Good,4,6 July 2015,"Like most of the reviews I really wanted to enjoy this film, I wanted to be taken back to being a small child and watching Jurassic Park for the first time, I wasn't. Some of the special effects were very good, but for me that's all this film had going for it. Even Chris Pratt who I loved in Parks and recreation didn't really bring anything to this film. As far as the story line, I was expecting much more, I was expecting something completely different from the first three films and it was just a tired re-hash with fresh idea's in terms of dinosaurs but the human element of the film was boring. I would suggest waiting for it to come out on a generic movie channel and watching it then.",Jurassic World
1219,smc_dap,Great for the younger generation... Bad for die hard Jurassic Park Fans.,2,18 June 2015,"Before I bash this movie, let me explain.(spoiler alert)The entire Jurassic Park movies have all had a special place in my heart. I had it on VHS growing up and it was the greatest thing for me and my sisters, it truly was. All the movies portrayed great suspense, amazing location and graphics, a great story, and all the characters had great roles. So when years passed and I found out that this movie was coming out, I was very excited but worried at the same time. I mean, lately the movies that come out with sequel baggage have not been impressive at all, so yes I was worried about this one. Then when I found out that it wasn't even directed my Stephen Spielberg, that shocked me even more! So when I first saw the trailer I thought to myself that it looked interesting but with the young actors and actresses, the movie would fail to portray a story in relevance to the other Jurassic Park movies that all of us die-hard Jurassic Park Fans love so dearly. I instantly had the impression that this movie was a target for a younger generation who knew nothing about the previous Jurassic Park movies. Nothing at all. There was one scene actually, several really, but this one caught my attention the most. The scene where the the main characters mom's assistant, Zara was killed in the most cruelest way among any of the characters of the entire film. This baffled me and showed me a great deal that this movie was indeed made to show off it's effects along with pretty actors/actresses. There really was little interest or effort put down towards a decent story line.Most scenes had nothing original to offer as you would expect, but like I said good sequels are hard to come across these days and it's a shame this one didn't live up to the hype. The end was fairly typical too; big dino against big dino.Honestly, this movie was more of a love story than anything Jurassic Park itself ever has laid down before which is why I mentioned its target for the younger crowd would would do little complaining and gulp up all the candy-coated action. Not to mention all of the obvious advertisements in the movie! Such a joke!After years of not having a Jurassic Park Movie step up, I was really hoping I'd come to like this movie. Unfortunately though, I didn't. For now though, I will just stick with my Jurassic Park movie collection and call it a night.",Jurassic World
1220,emmatanur,"Movie about a dinosaur theme park with huge, amazing attractions. Two boys visit their aunt but then get lost in the theme park when a dangerous dinosaur is loose.",10,20 June 2015,"This movie is better than the first. The first Jurassic Park was the best.. until this one came out. Watching it in 3D was thrilling. It wasn't too long but didn't feel rushed at all. The graphics were awesome and the movie was extremely intense (but not in the annoying way). You should go watch it. If someone says that it ""sucks"" or was ""lame,"" see for yourself because I guarantee that it is neither lame or suckish (I know.. that's not a word). I've watched a lot of comedies, thrillers, and action movies, but still this movie has become my favorite. I'm not an easy critic, however this movie had exceeded my expectations. If you are looking for a Jurassic movie that is as good as the first, then go to the theater right now. It's a great thriller and it brings the viewer into the park itself. The characters are great, the action is awesome, the dinosaurs are huge, and the music is fantastic.",Jurassic World
1221,jtkopczynski,really good,10,21 June 2015,"definitely watch it; it's a rehashed version of the original Jurassic park while paying homage to the past Jurassic park films. i personally enjoyed the idea of having Zach and Grey as the main characters over the scientists (malcolm, grant, sattler) and everything ties in quite well. the indominus Rex is amazing once you get to see her. the suspense and build up for the indominus Rex (twice) are both incredible. the film may seem long (it's about 2 hours and 30 minutes) but you'll be entertained from the very beginning to the very end. this movie is a great edition to the Jurassic park series and it's definitely better than Jurassic park 2 and 3, almost as good as the original. the movie is more action packed and doesn't weight in story as much but certain attributes to the characters (spoiler: like Owen and the raptors) becomes relevant in the end. spoiler by the way, the t-Rex makes an appearance and the ending containing the t-Rex is the best thing ever.",Jurassic World
1222,kmgalahad,Steven Spielberg delivers again.,9,21 June 2015,"Reading through some of these reviews, it seems that people nitpick way too much, it's almost as if they have some sort of personal grudge with these new releases. Like honestly, when was the last time any of you saw a movie you were satisfied with? Moving on to the review, Jurassic World delivers every bit of action, suspense, and awe- inspiring dino moments as the original Jurassic Park, but with a more modern twist. The CGI is done well but not overdone, and the story is written well, and the acting is brilliant by Pratt and Howard. Overall, the film has a lot of rewatchability, and is a worthy sequel to Spielberg's 1993 phenomenon. A brilliant movie, I recommend every to go watch it.",Jurassic World
1223,juditbalint,good movie,8,4 March 2017,"I loved this movie. I don't understand negative ratings here. There's plenty of action. There are strong characters, huge dinosaurs, amazing special effects. Add a star because it's scary without being gruesome. Go see it. Definitely one to see on the big screen. It's got a huge box office for a reason. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie where that happened.",Jurassic World
1224,bauron-43001,Giant Advertisement,1,27 June 2015,"This movie is mostly garbage. It is mainly a giant advertisement for various companies. As I have only seen it once, I cannot list everyone of them. You might as well watch a Football game instead of this movie (without skipping the ads). The chief perpetrator is Mercedes, followed closely by the US army apparatus, Starbucks, Samsung and Pepsi. The main actor, Chris Pratt, is the only reason the movie does not descend into a CBS news special. Dude is real as it comes. Bryce is a smidgen shy off campy and, even less shy of being in an episode of icarly. The Indian actor Irfan Khan tries his best, but still looks like he saying ""I can't believe how douchy Hollywood really is."" Vincent is convincing as a red neck. He is even touching himself in his first scene with Irfan, just as most hicks do when interacting with minorities. The dialog is barely there, and often unnecessary, especially during the action. The monosyllables gutturally uttered snap you out of the scene. The story line is unresolved. What happens to the Pterodactyls after they are done briefly mauling the crowd? Why is the crane mentioned while feeding the GM Dino, but never used in the story? How are the four Velociraptors hurt so often and come back for the climax, but only one leaves the scene? The one time they might have gotten hurt in the confusion of the climatic fight is when they were killed. The possible solution to the conundrum of the GM Dino is another GM dino who is not mentioned in the entire movie until the conclusion. Total Cop out. How does the fight move from central plaza of the very expensive theme park to the edge of the water containment of the Whale Dino, when most of the scenes have Bryce lying between the Dino's feet? Why pay homage to the first series at all - is Hollywood running out of money for what it can and cannot do and has to use an old set ?Call me Crusty. But this is beyond bad.",Jurassic World
1225,rajamshanks-75033,Most disappointed,1,28 June 2015,"Extremely disappointed. Nothing stands out. Poor screen play, direction, acting, music. This is a cheap attempted imitation of the original Jurassic park 1. Even the sequences are sad repetition of the best opener movie. One of the most sad part is either the cast is bad as they don't know how to act or have no scope. For example Bryse Howard was awful with blank face, no expression even in a most crisis situation. Really Ron' daughter? Not sure why the star cast like Irfan Khan with absolutely no scope of acting was cast in this movie. Please don't do this again. Leave us to enjoy Spielberg's original magic. If needed re-release the original.",Jurassic World
1226,hotmalias,Loved it,10,28 June 2015,"I loved this movie. I don't understand some of the negative ratings here. This is not a Fellini movie we're reviewing. It's dinosaurs. And plenty of them. I think this is every bit as good as JPI and way better than the other two. There's plenty of action. There are strong characters, big dinosaurs, spectacular special effects. Add a star because it's scary without being gruesome. The plot is plausible in a movie that's based on a totally fantastical platform to start with. Go see it. Definitely one to see on the big screen. It's got a huge box office for a reason. People spontaneously clapped at the start of the ending credits.

1227,cookscc,Acting what acting?,3,30 June 2015,"Overall the CGI was awesome. The level at which they can accomplish this is amazing. However, the acting was beyond terrible. Really I have not seen such bad acting in a blockbuster such as this.The kids were better actors than the lead characters. Chris Pratt needs to work on his acting as I thought it was lame enough in Guardians of the Galaxy but this work is way beyond bad.I think I am becoming jaded with all these special effects now. I am old school and believe you still need good actors. Get some decent actors!",Jurassic World
1228,Heraklion,Poorly-Written,6,3 July 2015,"When I heard about Jurassic World's box office records, I was intrigued. I thought, ""Surely Jurassic World offers something valuable enough to garner that much attention"". I expected a movie with great visuals, action, and an exciting premise. I was satisfied in that regard. The visuals were fine, and I never felt bored. The premise was passable, and the action was fun. Although the CGI was poorly-rendered and overused, it was forgivable.What disappointed me the most, however, was the writing.A lot of the dialogue was atrocious. It seemed as if nobody had reviewed the script, or that the script writer had never bothered to write a second draft. Often, the characters say things which don't belong given the context. When characters should express terror or horror, they act sentimental. Another horrid aspect of Jurassic World's writing was the forced character development. Terribly, terribly forced character development! There was nothing subtle or convincing about the changes in each character. It was as if the script writers had heard that character development was important, but had no idea how to properly incorporate it into a movie. On several occasions the characters deliver lines out of context, in order to drive some character development into the film. Here are two examples of horribly-written character changes:-- The growing bond between the younger boy and the teenager. -- The manager, Claire, and her viewpoint regarding the dinosaurs.On one occasion the teenager changed dramatically all of a sudden, without explanation. He began to pay more attention to his younger brother, acting softer and kinder, consoling him. Wait... what? Just a moment ago, the teenager was ignoring him and being a sultry jerk! Again, it's as if nobody reviewed the script. The character changes were jerky and jarring.Finally, the script contained many poorly-fleshed out subplots which didn't seem to belong at all. They added a whole ""family issue"" subplot, with the divorce of the parents of the two child characters. They mentioned it once in the beginning, once in the middle, and once in the end, with no proper resolution. Are we supposed to care?The romance between Claire and Owen (Chris Pratt) was passable, but I wish that it was more three-dimensional. The only conflict that took place between them was petty banter used as a form of comic relief. It was just a generic Hollywood romance that nobody asked for. The writing did have its moments of excellence, though. The comic relief was well-executed, to the point that I wished that there was more of it. Some of the most enjoyable moments in that film were jokes.In conclusion, the film was fun but poorly-written. 6/10.",Jurassic World

The advertising was so aggressive it reminded me of Wayne's World. I spent 2 hours hoping for the annoying, smart-aleck kid to get killed - knowing it will never happen. It was the phantom menace all over again. Chris Pratts acting is so unreal, I first thought he was a CGI character too. There is no thrill when all characters are 100% cliché, and you know from the first second the only people that are able to get hurt are villains or extras.",Jurassic World
1231,everymanonearth,Awful,1,14 July 2015,"What a terrible spin on the story.The acting was good, but the story was just terrible, it was so much of the same old same old that it just ruined the entire movie. In fact, I was expecting to see Jeff Goldblum appear sooner or later, I suspect that he was too professional to even consider an appearance. And as for Jimmy Falon, oh dear, the ludicrous swept smartly into the ridiculous.It is a shame that what was really pretty good acting performances, and by the way I am a fan of Vincent D'Onofrio, was marred by the senseless repetitive story. Sorry I keep going on about how dreadful the story was, did I mention that the story gave the impression that two buddies spent a Saturday getting hammered and decided to steal something from here and there and see how it worked?I will give credit for the special effects, they were pretty good but again, sadly in this day and age it wasn't anything spectacular, if you want that then watch the Matrix.So, all in all; been there, seen it, done it and ironically (if you watch the movie you will see what I mean) - got the t-shirt, is the best way I can describe this. What really saddens me is that IMDb has probably been paid a small fortune by this movies makers to have not only the dedicated page, but also keep the 'less than praising' reviews away from the users. I guess I will see if this appears. In the meantime I will add it publicly to my FaceBook page and see if anyone reads it!",Jurassic World
1232,kristydindorf,There were dinosaurs. And they were awesome.,8,6 March 2016,"So some stuff happened and then there was some screaming and there was some plot or something and then THERE WERE DINOSAURS AND THEY WERE AWESOME. End of review. Okay, okay, fine, that's not an actual movie review. I know. But it basically sums up the entire zeitgeist of the film. It's a madcap romp (stomp? Trample? Whatever the dinosaurs do) through the entire island-turned-theme-park, letting in surprisingly astute glimmers of what an actual dinosaur theme park would be like in the 21st century. The director was fully aware of the fact that he'd been handed a film that was the equivalent of being asked to raise a baby raptor with dollar signs tattooed to its torso. Thus the first moments of the film are slow and pondering – a languorous long take of that baby raptor poking its nose (beak? Snout? Body part with all the teeth?) out of its egg. Pure. Innocent. A meditative moment on birth and life (however unnatural), as Ian Malcolm put so elegantly in the first movie, finding its way. The juxtaposition between this slow moment and the next two hours is significant and jarring. The next few scenes depict two children departing for the fully opened theme park where the T-Rex can be sponsored by Verizon and product placement is both blatant and seamlessly integrated into the teeming corporate mass organism that is the modern American theme park. People are getting comfortable around these prehistoric monsters. By the time we see that baby raptor again, she's fully grown and fully commercialized as a potential army tool, with Chris Pratt as her beleaguered Alpha trainer (as Indiana-Jones esque Owen Grady with slightly less humour and charm. Much as it pains me to say, they really wasted the opportunity to fully utilize a lead who could be both the All-American square jawed hero AND a witty self-aware comedian with the great timing Pratt has shown on other mediums such as Parks and Recreation). Commercialization of nature and science, and the aftershocks thereof, are best personified in the character of Claire (played convincingly by Bryce Dallas Howard). The secret star of the film, her character undergoes the largest arch – from uptight corporate clone to fully fleshed out human being who realizes a) nature is mightier than the geneticist, b) her sexuality, c) her relationship with her family, d) that she can indeed be brave and get a T-REX to intentionally chase her in the name of self-sacrifice for the people she had little to no interest in at the start of the film (namely Grady and her nephews). Naturally at the end, Claire and Owen walk off together into the sunset (literally. They literally walk into the sunset. I did not say this movie was very subtle.), and the dinosaurs once more have free reign over Isla Nublar, setting up the next sequel. Yet, none of this feels overly contrived. Because the movie simply embraces what it is, which is an enthusiastic romp with the prehistoric creatures humans have always been fascinated by, with occasional drips of snarky self-aware commercialization and capitalism questions, there is no part of the film that feels like it wants to do more than earnestly entertain you and maybe sprinkle in some information if you want it, Mr. DNA style. And entertain it does. Favourite moments? When Claire pets a brontosaurus and realizes the full living majesty of dinosaurs. When Indominous Rex communicates in raptor-speak to her raptor cousins. Any moment where the Mosasaur is on screen. Any moment where the T-Rex is on screen, heroically saving the day by fighting its genetically modified rival for human attention. Any moment where any dinosaur is on screen ever. Dinosaurs are inherently amazing reminders that humanity has not always been the dominant species and that once this planet was Planet of the (terrifying prehistoric) Birds. They are large and loud and beautifully rendered for our imaginations here on screen. Basically, there were dinosaurs. And they were awesome. End of review. TL,DR: Dinosaurs.",Jurassic World

Stunning effects made this compelling to watch, but the film lacked any real story telling and in the main was very predictable. The boys are sitting in a round vehicle, SHOCK! The bad dinosaur plays football with it. Figured who was going to die right at the beginning of the film. I did find the whole concept a bit far fetched. After all of the disasters in the first films with the dinosaurs in the first films, people still want to go and see these things? You'd have to be stupid, and probably deserve to get chomped on by a T. Rex. The Mercedes Benz product placement was a little to obvious too.

Here, I'll answer that because I'm feeling so nice - NO!The only good thing about the movie was the music. Congrats Michael and John. You saved this review from getting a 1.That and Chris Pratt's gorgeous face were the only things keeping me from walking out of the cinema right there and then. And the knowledge that I paid fifteen whole dollars to get in.I could've bought a book with that money...Oh, you want me to tell you what's wrong with it? Hah, I can't even remember anymore, that movie stayed for one angry day in my memory and then it was gone. The garbage truck came and carried it away. But let me try and recall a few Number one of things that annoyed me: the graphics. The film makers forgot that we're living in the twenty-first century. Obviously. It was so bad that, instead of gaping in awe at the non-existent, breath-catching graphics, I spent the whole time wondering which dinosaurs were made of plastic and which ones were little men in green suits. I couldn't stop imagining two dudes sitting on top of each other making raptor sounds. Still brings tears of laughter to my eyes.Number two of what-the-heck-was-this-garbage: the characters. Did the writers not put any effort into their background? Their personalities? Their wants and goals? Wait, I can answer that - NO. Cliché family with cliché problems, cliché older, obnoxious brother, cliché, faraway relative that the kids are shipped off to who, cliché, is totally into their work and doesn't look after them.Guess what type of character Chris Pratt played.SPOILER!! He was cliché. Big surprise there. That one dude who's all rogue and sexy, spends his whole time trying to kiss the unemotional, uncaring, uninteresting girl.SPOILER!! They get together in the end.Okay, there's one scene that I can't get out of my head - even the trash man couldn't take it out - because it's just so bloody annoying. The kids go missing - duh - and the uninteresting, workaholic girl and sexy-rogue Chris Pratt go on a daring mission to find them. (Let me just point out that she was in a white dress and high heels the whole time). Anyway, they come across this field of dead Brachiosaurus (I had to look that up on google. The movie didn't even teach me that), and there's one lying on the ground twitching its very plastic head up and down. I had to laugh it looked so robotic. Again, all I could think about was some dude hiding behind it, like, moving it around.So they kneel down next to it and START STROKING ITS HEAD. What. The. Heck. YOUR NEPHEWS ARE OUT THERE IN THE PARK ALONE AND PROBABLY RIGHT NOW GETTING EATEN AND YOU'RE CRYING OVER SOME DINO?! Take into account that she is uncaring, unemotional and completely unsympathetic.But - you might say - that's character development! No. No that is not. That is the writers creating such shallow and unsustainable characters that they forgot the only trait that stupid woman had in the first place.If I listed everything that I hated about this movie I'd have to describe every second. Now, at this point, I'd say - well, how 'bout I write about the things I actually did like.Chris Pratt. The music.That's it.So, when do you think Jurassic Park 6 is coming out? I've already got a title – Jurassic Universe. Can't wait to write the review for that",Jurassic World
1235,willrussellreviews,Visually-dazzling and undeniably entertaining thriller is relatively tame.,7,2 August 2015,"Now, in no way does Jurassic World match or surpass the original, however, Chris Pratt conveys a certain element of wit and charm that was definitely missing from the third installment of the insanely-popular franchise. Flaws with the plot or the film's believability can be entirely overlooked because its intense create violence and peril never lets up. However, due to the movie's PG-13 rating, besides the extensive and slightly bloody dinosaur fight sequences, most of the violent and gruesome deaths occur off-screen. The swearing is limited to infrequent uses of ""s--t,"" and parents can expect a few suggestive remarks sprinkled throughout the movie's 124-minute runtime. Altogether, this is one heart- quickening and superbly-paced action thrill-ride that you definitely won't want to miss. Score: 70% Age Recommendation: 10+",Jurassic World

This time , as people ratings were dropping , the scientists made a very clever Indominious rex who is stronger than the T-rex and much more cleverer than any dianosaur.

I didn't feel like any of them we're very nice and the main human villain got a much nicer death than he deserved. Especially since the only innocent character players by Katie Mcgrath got the most horrific and torturously painful death. However I did enjoy watching this movie and the visual effects were stunning. If you go in expecting to watch an Oscar worth movie with a deep message you'll be very disappointed.

1239,emily-79945,"""Hold onto your butts"" Jurassic Park is back",8,24 April 2016,"The hideous roar of a Tyrannosaurus rex and is stand over its prey is back.The dreams of a fully functioning dinosaur park finally come true in 2015's Jurassic World or does it? 20 years ago when the idea was first tried out, things didn't go so well. Alright, more like a total meltdown disaster. But, InGen corporation has figured out how to smooth out the bumps of the earlier park. John would have defiantly been proud of what it has become or would he? Did we learn to keep these dangerous animal in or do we once again get to hear the roaring screeches of these magnificent animals as we run for our lives in the opposite direction.Not only has InGen cloned and made extinct creatures, they have been able to fully incorporate this place into an incredible petting zoo with 5 star hotel and for the ladies shopping area's. The park is running so smoothly that they decided to up their game. The investors wanted something bigger,faster and scarier to add to the attractions and bring more people to the park. So the lab whipped up a genetically super beast made up of a T.Rex and a bunch of other top-secret animals that are being kept on the down low. They call it Indominus Rex. A new enormous attraction .Which gives the park administrator, Claire a lot more work on her plate. Who is frantically putting things together to get ready to show to the public. A hectic job yes, but she knows what she's doing and knows the business very well.She is a no nonsense kind of person, that's why when she has to work with Owen, and ex navy seal. Who was brought in to care for the raptors and learn how to control them. Owen was difficult to convince about the Indominus Rex, he had questions about safety, and how smart it was to genetically cross species to create a monster we know nothing about. Claire thinking he was just a silly boy who knew nothing about the business aspects of making the Indominus Rex. But, then disaster hit, again. As the Indominus starts doing things no one could have predicted it could do. Claire does have a little bit more to worry about however. Her nephews Zach and Gray were sent to the resort over Christmas break while their mother and father work through some marital problems at home. They are more of a problem for Claire because she had not connected with her family in a while she only had one thing on her mind, becoming the best business women she could be.Even though with the dinosaur on the loose, this becomes a good thing for the boys as the band together and bond like never have. Both Claire and Own risk their lives and save each other numerous of time while look for these lost nephews and try to capture the Indominus Rex.There is no sexual content inappropriate for children, the violence however is a little bit of a different story. There are a few moments of animals getting torn apart, things that is dripping with blood or it spattered on the wall and a few flesh ripping scenes from the dinosaurs. A lot of raptor attacks where a raptor does rip off a human's arms. Raptors attack and rip soldiers apart in a forest. Pterodactyls swooping in on large groups of people using their large scary talons to throw people around like a rag doll. A woman is grabbed and pulled back and forth back and forth by two dinosaurs flying in the air then reach up and grabbed then swallowed whole. Many gun scenes with bullets blazing. And the worst of all Owen punches Hoskins in the face. Okay, that not true.Not too much crude or profane language. Only a few drug and alcohol content where we see a guy picking up two margaritas at the resort, and only one joke about the craziness of a diet that does not include tequila but, nothing your child will pick up on.We see that a park for dinosaurs is just not a great idea it didn't work 20 years ago why would it work now? Those investors have got to stop investing in these things. You enjoy the great acting put on by the entire cast you will feel a few cheesy parts, but what movie doesn't have little cheese? You'll witness a scary, thrilling, exhilarating ride through these giant reptilian CGI that captures the dinosaur in a very lifelike way. You'll not be disappointed.

1240,emilien-42508,My favourite movie.,9,29 March 2016,"Jurassic World is a really good action, adventure and science fiction movie who take place in a new dinosaur park. This movie was release the 10 June 2015 and is directed by Colin Trevorrow. The film is the 4th film of the Jurassic Park series.The movie is the story of two people, Gray Mitchell and Zach Mitchell, who go to the new Jurassic Park. Claire Dearing, the aunt of the two boys and the headmistress of the park, and all the team of Jurasic World will create a new species of dinosaur. But this creature will just be a genetically modified giant stealth killing machine. Owen Grady will train 4 velociraptor to fight the dinosaur. But the velociraptor will turn against them.The cast is really good. It include Chris Pratt (Owen), Bryce Dallas Howard (Claire), Irrfan Khan (Masrani), Vincent D'Onofrio (Hoskins) and a loot more.

1241,tdsundberg,It's Back,10,27 March 2016,Jurassic World is the Jurassic Park of this generation. It returns us to the island where it began for an amazing feature presentation with live dinosaurs and one not so real one. Overall the movie was visually stunning and really stood out from movies of this generation. It gives you a chance to see what a true dinosaur theme park would look like. The cast was well cat and both worked off of the chemistry from each other. The dinosaurs were so realistic and it was truly terrifying.? The movie also had a good story to follow. It was able to keep me in my seat for the entire time and demanding more. The dinosaur blockbuster also earned over 1.6 billion in the global box office. People still aren't done with dinosaurs and neither should you. I'd give this movie a shot. You will not regret it.,Jurassic World

This is a complete remake of Jurassic Park: family goes to park, creature escapes, chaos ensues, and add a subplot of sneaky corporate double dealings. The only redeeming quality this has over JP is that Jeff Goldbloom isn't in it. The decision NOT to evacuate the island is an indefensible plot failing. The final battle scene had me calling BS. I'm more than willing to suspend belief...to a point. The decisions in the writing of the plot are dubious at best.Don't give this unoriginal ""film"" any money or time. Quite disappointed in the ratings here. Maybe they are from youngsters who didn't see the original, sycophants of the franchise, or corporate shills trying to beef up the reputation.

At some point Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard) revealed to Owen(Chris Pratt) that the corporate felt genetic modification would up the 'wow' factor. Well Colin Trevorrow, you are trying too hard to make a blockbuster instead of something memorable.In my opinion Owen and Simon(Irrfan Khan) played convincingly well, and lifted the movie, despite the plot being very predictable, not to mention the coerced family bonding field trip moments. The super intelligent multilingual hybrid dinosaur with thermal and cryptic camouflage is just too much. It even sports its own long range thermal sense. However, I would not say the movie sucks, it has many good qualities and much of the same atmosphere that we found in the original movie. It is certainly entertaining with awesome CGI, massive dinosaurs roaming vast grassy fields(which should at least inspire some awe in most people), decent acting, and not too many plot holes. The latter part of the movie has plenty fast paced action.. with a notable exception for Claire on high heels outrunning a T-Rex... facepalm.",Jurassic World

In my opinion, i think it was a good movie.This place in the movie was on an island called Isla nublar. I think that they did it on an island because they did not want any of the dinos to escape from the park. This movie took place in Costa Rica and came out in the united states.I liked this movie because it kind of gives you a picture in your mind the only part that I didn't like is when they thought that the dino escaped. The lesson that I learned doesn't make something that you don't know what it will do. I think that others will learn not to do something stupid.I know that paleontologist will like this movie because it includes dinosaurs and paleontologists study dinosaurs.

To often we expect films to have a strong moral or social message but why does this always have to be the case. It was first and foremost a film about a dinosaur theme park and I feel that needs to be kept in focus.

1256,HawkeyePierce4077,A Worthy Entry Into The Series (Contains Spoilers),8,17 June 2015,"Let me start by saying I was 6 years old when the first Jurassic Park came out; and I remember being scared shitless the first time I saw the T-Rex. When I first heard they were making a new movie without any of the original cast (I would only later learn that Dr. Wu would make an appearance), I was cautious about the movie. I wanted it to be good; but I didn't want to get my hopes up and have them shattered like they'd been for JP3.When I heard the movie had made $500 million in 3 days; I knew my worries about it were unfounded. I couldn't wait to see it and bought a 3D ticket at my local theater. I'll admit that there were parts of the movie I didn't care for; like the brothers discussing a possible divorce on the monorail only for it to never be mentioned again.I enjoyed the many easter eggs regarding the original movies; seeing the Jurassic Park visitor center and the ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"" banner. I got a chuckle when I saw the goggles similar to the ones Tim used in the original movie.The last 15-20 minutes of the movie, in my opinion made up for any of the films shortcomings. Seeing Rexy (the T-Rex from the original movie) initially having the upper hand in the fight against the I-Rex, only to be overpowered...I'll admit I thought she was going to die. Until Blue returned and distracted the I-Rex. I cheered, as did many in the theater, as Rexy and Blue tagged teamed the I-Rex until it could be eaten by the Mososaur.On an end note, Michael Giachinno did an amazing job with the score; especially revisiting the classic theme from the original movie.",Jurassic World

1260,jglonek,"Great movie, great fun",9,12 June 2015,"My wife and I loved the movie. I'm not sure what others wanted out of it, but we were looking for a movie where dinosaurs run amok in a theme park, and we were not disappointed. I daresay I enjoyed it more than Age of Ultron. This is definitely a movie you shouldn't take too seriously and just have fun with it (for instance, why are you all arguing about the heels? Sure it's silly and she should have tossed them off ASAP and gotten some boots, but it by no means should negatively effect your viewing experience.)I have to wonder if people who really enjoy theme parks (or better yet, work(ed) in them) will get more out of this movie than those who do not. I am very familiar with behind the scenes of theme parks, and how they look from an employee perspective, and this movie nailed that. I loved the opening reveal of the park through the hotel room. I loved all the hotels on site. I loved the Universal Citywalk-esque main plaza. All the sponsorships (""Indominus Rex, sponsored by Verizon Wireless""), everyone on their cell phones during the mosasaurus, the bored employees, the visitors staring at an employee telling them the ride is closed because they are angry and/or don't speak English. The fact that they didn't want to kill the iRex originally because it was a ""$26 million dollar investment"" (basically a walking roller- coaster). Good stuff.And my wife works in animal care and absolutely loved the raptor scenes. She was playfully nitpicking everything Chris Pratt did wrong (""he needs to work on the timing of his bridges!""). And the petting zoo (especially where the kid had his hands around the dino's neck), ""This is what I deal with every day"". I expect her and her work colleagues who saw the movie to have some good laughs today over it. I also enjoyed how they didn't get sentimental with Pratt when his raptors started going after the humans. He came off as someone who knew he was working with wild animals, and that this would happen. Disappointment, sure. Sadness at their deaths, sure. But he wasn't caught off guard. His ""Watch your six - the raptors have a new alpha"" was a perfect line.As for the dinosaurs themselves, great, great. I can't complain that they were almost entirely CG, it was fine. The only poor point of the movie I think was InGen's militarization and wanting to use dinosaurs in warfare. I just.. we have plenty of dangerous, wild animals now that we don't use in warfare, because it's not practical/possible. I'm not sure why someone would think you could with dinosaurs? And they had the whole raptor ""field test"" recorded, which ended very poorly, so I can't see someone using that as a case study for use of dinosaurs to fight wars. But even after that Hoskins was acting like it was a good idea, and getting the embryos off the island?Oh, and for anyone still concerned about the look of the dinosaurs in this movie, Dr. Wu specifically states (paraphrasing here) that the dinosaurs are not accurate, they never have been accurate, and he could make them accurate. But InGen wanted monsters, so he gave them monsters. Sure, that might be a bit of retconning, but it's good enough for me.Oh, and finally, I want to give props to the marketing department for this movie. They did a great job setting up the Jurassic World website as if it was a real theme park, and it has a lot of information on it. And if you haven't visited it again yet, it has been updated to reflect the events in the movie (technical difficulty message on the main page, webcams with guests running), as if this is actually happening at a real theme park right now.

1267,kimberlyjaress,Jurassic World: Is it Worth it?,10,5 October 2021,"In the movie, Jurassic World directed by Colin Trevorrow, it brings a new spin to the classics of Jurassic Park, the trilogy. It was supposed to be new, improved, and most importantly safe. That all went south when the staff tried to do God's work and genetically mix one of the two most vicious dinosaurs out there, the t-rex and velociraptor. Many people drift away from remakes of original movies claiming,"" It won't be the same"" and never giving it a chance. This movie may surprise you and make you rethink your assumptions on future remakes. Throughout the movie there are loads of adventures, love interests, and relationships. Your attention will not be lost.The movie presents the audience with many connections, grasping their attention. The film can intrigue anyone who is into romance, comedy, or action having diverse viewers. Relationships such as the two brothers, Owen and Claire, and primarily with Owen and a velociraptor named Blue. They have a bond like no other and it proves that it is possible to have that trust with a dinosaur. Their ""relationship"" is put to the test multiple times throughout the film and even ends with Blue saving Owen and his friends. They are very protective of each other and it shows the love created between man and dinosaur. In one part of the film the velociraptors are being ordered by the genetically modified dinosaur to attack the soldiers who got in their way. Owen happened to be there and Blue was almost going to follow his instincts and attack, but she realized who it was. She runs away, saving Owen. The audience will create an attachment to these characters and follow their relationship throughout the film.People that see the original series of movies, shows, etc tend to steer away from remakes or add-ons thinking they won't be as enjoyable, but if you gave them a chance it could surprise you. For example, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, etc came out continuing the series from 1977-2005. Many die-hard fans were reluctant about seeing the new releases, but after watching, they were proven wrong. This was because there were many reviews liking the film such as Rotten tomatoes, IMDB, and Common Sense Media, showing that Jurassic World did a good job of proving that remakes and spin-offs can be just as good as the ""classics"". The movie even included a snippet talking about Jurassic park and the tragedy it reflected, creating a sort of reminiscing moment for the fans of the original trilogy. This film can help rethink your choice on trying out spin off films because you may like them just as much or even more! The audience of all ages would enjoy this action packed, love/hate relationship filled movie.Jurassic World is an adventure-lover's dream come true. It is action packed and will keep you on your toes of what's going to happen next. It is unpredictable what anyone will do, especially pertaining to the dinosaurs. Even if someone hasn't seen the originals, they will truly understand what's going on and thoroughly enjoy it.Works CitedJurassic World. Directed by Colin Trevorrow, 2015.",Jurassic World

1269,PymParticle,Disappointing,4,12 June 2015,"I wanted so much to like this movie. Jurassic Park is my favorite movie to date, and I'd hoped based on the premise that this film would reinvigorate the same themes (with regard to harnessing nature and taking advantage of scientific advancement) but was sorely disappointed. For a start, the acting and the script are terrible. The only character with whom I identify and sympathize is the T-Rex, and that's mainly because she's the same rex that appeared in the first film and I feel some kind of kinship with her. The movie focuses primarily on two kids, neither of whom are relatable (and the older one, honestly, is kind of a dick), Chris Pratt's character (who has minimal depth), and the lady scientist (who is a walking, talking stereotype of the female Ice Queen). You don't feel saddened by the fact that any of these characters might die. The 'raptors are severely mollified, the ""new"" dinosaur is inexplicably genius while simultaneously devoid of character (unlike the 'raptors in Jurassic Park), and it seems like ever other scene is a direct knockoff of the original.I have to imagine that someone somewhere was placating themselves with the knowledge that these scenes were an homage to the original, but they weren't. They were a knockoff. The writers looked back at the previous movies and cobbled together some hybrid formula, with facets that mostly didn't work for Lost World or Jurassic Park III, and called it a day. There were several scenes that actually sent the entire audience into fits of laughter - unintentionally. The exposition is awkward, the characters are unlikeable, and the action is laughably fake. As I said, I really wanted to like this movie...but it was just as bad as a SyFy original. Absolutely no depth, just lots of CGI (and one laughably brief shot of an animatronic dinosaur).",Jurassic World
1270,TheHutch89,Jurassic World bring new life to series,8,8 October 2015,"As someone who grew up in the 90's I was elated to find out Jurassic Park was coming back with the fourth installment to the series with this summer's biggest blockbuster, Jurassic World. Jurassic Park was by far the best and most memorable film of the original trilogy. The sequels were still extremely profitable but were unpopular among fans and critics. So after 14 years the series is back, and maybe the long hiatus was the shot in the arm the series needed. Jurassic World roared into theaters this summer and was not only a financial success but also a great story that gives viewers the opportunity to finally see the park open to the public. The film follows a dinosaur trainer who must use his knowledge and bravery to help stop a genetically engineered dinosaur that is even more powerful and smarter than the T-Rex we had nightmares about after seeing the original film.We quickly learn that Jurassic World has been open for over a decade and that park management feels it must do whatever it takes to ensure people are coming to Jurassic World in droves. A T-Rex is no longer enough to wow their guest so they make a dinosaur that does. Using the DNA from both a T-Rex and a raptor to create a bigger, faster, stronger, smarter, and aggressive dinosaur. This would have very likely been a huge financial success for the park if they were able to contain this billion dollar experiment but they apparently ran out of funding to build a proper encasement. There should be no excuse for a dinosaur escaping but the movie requires some action so no one should analyze that scene to harshly.The characters in this movie are stereotypical clichés that one might expect from a big summer blockbuster. They each fulfill a role even if their character development is extremely predictable. Despite having an above average cast I thought many of the actors had a hard time delivering some of their lines and making it believable to the audience. I attribute that to a poorly written script at least as far as dialogue is concerned. The script is probably the one thing I would call for a change on. I understand that the dialogue must be somewhat simplistic because of the vast number of audiences this film appeals to but I truly believe there were better writers who could have helped the actors become more believable.Despite the dinosaur breakout, Chris Pratt's character was able to limit the damage and become the action hero every great summer movie needs. I think the overall message of the film is that we need to stop messing with nature and playing god before we extinct ourselves. It seems evident that the follow up to their years film will focus on the idea of using dinosaurs as weapons in war. I can only imagine what can go wrong next. Jurassic World is by no means a perfect movie. But it is the perfect summer blockbuster. Sure it might be corny at times but it is one of those films where you are never bored. This movie answers the question of what would it be like if the park ever opened? The modern day visual effects and the bright vivid colors make this a visual stunning film. This was a great rebirth of an incredibly popular franchise. Jurassic World proved that audiences are not sick of dinosaurs.",Jurassic World
1271,rrichmond-2,"Lots of fun, some great action moments",9,14 June 2015,"I think reviewers are trying too hard to find a reason not to like this movie. I had high hopes for this film and they were exceeded. I went to enjoy a movie with good action sequences and lots of dinosaurs and you get that in bunches.The thing that's lacking when comparing it to the original is the sense of awe, but how are you going to recapture that? In fact, that's part of the plot: people are already bored with dinosaurs. But the dinosaur action and the sense of terror and excitement are there.Is it Oscar worthy? Of course not. But I would assume most people know what to expect when they go see a summer action blockbuster movie and this movie delivers on that. Let your brain disengage, try not to over-think it, and have some fun.My biggest criticism is not the script (okay) or the acting (good), but that all of the ""background"" dinosaurs (not the stars) are the same dull grays and browns. Would have loved to have seen a little time taken in the CGI to make the supporting cast of dinosaurs (triceratops, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, parasaurolophus, ankylosaurus) more colorful.Hoping that this film does what the original did: create a whole new generation of dinosaur scientists.",Jurassic World
1272,trisha_white,HOW did they manage to screw this up?,4,12 June 2015,"As a big fan of the franchise, I squealed with delight at the trailer and was there for the first show on the first day, filled with anticipation - but left the theater crestfallen. Yes, JW delivers the toothy gotcha scenes and a witty commentary on jaded, demanding consumerism, but it's the weakest Jurassic in the litter. JW is scattered. There are at least 4 plots - any ONE of which would have made a swell movie, if they had hired a writer. Long, boring patches between action, aborted story lines and character traits everywhere. JW is lazy. Where Jurassic 1 and 2 had strong, multi-dimensional male and female characters, JW characters are flat, undeveloped, tired stereotypes. And you'll want all of them to get eaten just so you won't have to hear the nauseating dialogue. Deus ex machina gets characters out of huge scrapes in one scene and then -- oops! -- cell phones don't work in the next. At the closing line, ""So what should we do now?"" I blurted out ""HIRE A WRITER!""",Jurassic World
1273,cameronjstewart,Hopefully a sequel will complete the half-baked elements of a greater narrative,6,10 August 2015,"Admittedly a fanatic of the original JP story created by Michael Crichton and the first feature film, I held a lot of pent-up nostalgia before seeing this film and my first viewing was mostly a ""sit-back-and- take-it-all-in"" kind of experience. After digesting the story and events, and viewing the film a few more times, I think I'm getting closer to understanding why Jurassic World did enough to please the palette of JP fans who anxiously awaited the next installment of this epic franchise, but not enough to capitalize on a very promising opportunity. Several scenes in this film are executed very well and create real moments of suspense like you would hope for in the scientific survival- horror genre. Michael Giacchino's inventive score plays a big part in this, paying just enough homage to keep within the original universe while accomplishing a modern tone to create a stark and somber atmosphere as well as the more joyful and playful moments that are common with Spielberg matinée-action films. I highly recommend, if nothing else, to give a listen to the soundtrack and immerse yourself in the wonder, adventure, and genuine thrills that exist on a island where humans rank a few spots down the food chain if not secured by their propensity to control nature and the environment (as Ian Malcolm eloquently monologues)But back to the original point, many scenes are filmed and directed very well on their own, primarily the dino-scenes, but the dinos should only be a subsidiary of a greater human narrative, as was on display in Crichton's original novel and the 1993 film.The story arc seems to be on a train track that's continually shifting the rails. As a ""passenger,"" you know the destination and have a sense of what's to unfold - and in many ways the characters and events are too predictable - but upon arrival you'll be left thinking, ""that was an unusual route to get to where we wanted to go."" I sit back and think about the characters of this film and just envision so many different interactions that could've taken place in order to help the viewer absorb the universe and feel the gravity of everything at-stake rather than being relegated to a mere observer of chaos and destruction.The film had charismatic elements, for sure: - Chris Pratt delivers his character very well, even with an at-times limited and underwhelming dialogue. - Irfan Khan is a natural as the eccentric president and owner of the park (his accent can be thick, but I appreciated the sincere disposition he carried as a caring owner and leader) - The intelligence and impressive capabilities of the I-Rex and Henry Wu's engineering are fun thoughts to toss around in theory, but don't necessarily play out to their full potential on-screen - The immense level of detail put into the park is truly astounding upon close inspection - And once again, Michael GiacchinoHowever, many elements will leave many underwhelmed: - Bryce Dallas Howard, though her acting is fine - even great at times, her character just didn't command enough charisma or engaging traits to be the film's leading presence. Perhaps it's because she switches too much between a dictating administrator, panicked/less thoughtful reactor to chaotic events, and simultaneously dismissive yet empathetic family member and lover. Her character arc, while identifiable, is like the overall story and prone to confusing turns - Hoskins, the InGen leader, has valid reasoning for his motives (even if far-fetched, DNA modification through gene-splicing as a mode of creating bio-weapons deserves to play out on film, and what's more fun than using extinct animals as the base genome) but the character is treated too often as a wily cartoon-villain too busy twiddling his mustache to present a convincing case for his ideas. - The forced love component between the two leads, and ""forced"" really is the best word because, while everything seems to be positioned for a survival situation to bring two people closer together, the audience doesn't really get the opportunity to 'feel' the bond being created. We're given a backstory and both Pratt and Howard possess charm, but the on-screen relationship that unfolds feels too much like a product of movie-making and doesn't possess enough humanity. At one point, Howard's character even goes so far to dismisses her borderline negligence on a ""technical malfunction"" that nearly resulted in Pratt's death - so where exactly is the caring and affection, I ask?On the whole, I still enjoy watching this film for the cinematography and direction during action sequences, but I wish the script and story- board would have been tweaked some more. It feels like some early ideas were stubbornly implanted into a film that tried to break free and become something transcendent but ultimately settled into something more comfortable.",Jurassic World
1274,arijit-chaudhuri,One of the most disappointing movies ever,1,16 June 2015,"The sequences were mostly borrowed from previous movies and were predictable. The same ideas of children caught out in the open, use of flares etc. Script was not fleshed out. Acting was mediocre. Special effects were fine. Action sequences were predictable and not gripping.Jurassic Park 3 was possibly better, which in itself is a big statement. The producers seem to have one objective, how to keep costs down (actors, scriptwriters ...) and maximize profits on a dependable brand. They will make money but grind the movie dinosaurs into oblivion too.Hopefully someone else will come up with a new take and revive the xsauruses.",Jurassic World

WORST MOMENT: after the 2 brothers jump off the cliff into the waterfall and crawl onto shore they stumble onto the old Jurassic Park (remember where 100's died, three times before) and the older kid asks his brother, ""You still got those matches?"" and the drenched lil' bro pulls a box of dry matches out of his wet pants.

But along with spectacular special effects we have in this movie comes a real responsibility of the director to insure the actors are aimed in the correct focal point and reaction emotions that bring interest not only to the main characters, in this case the dinosaurs, but to their characters as well.With credit being given to the terrific human actors showing for up to do this film we have to remind ourselves they are reacting to a green screen and imaginary set-ups to build hopefully enough suspense to bring the people they portray to hold the audience.

And I love how the woman ends up taking literally all of the blame for the people who die. Because the real world there would really be ONE person in charge of everything. Where was the board? And the parents really sent them off to a park with dinosaurs by themselves? Really, they couldn't have planned to take off work like normal people? No. Just no. Chris Pratt and the redhead did well. Beautiful people, great actors. But there was a fundamental breakdown in the script/directing. It wasn't doing it for me.

1278,itscaco,The reason theaters were made.,9,13 June 2015,"I don't go to many movies in theaters, mainly because there is not many movies out there that are interesting enough to watch. I usually tend to just wait for things to come out on disc if it appeals to me at all. However, with the recent come back of Godzilla in 2014, and now Jurassic World, I've had two reasons to come to the theaters two years in a row.These kind of movies are without a doubt, the reason you go see films in an actual theater. Big dinosaurs on a big screen, loud roars and thudding footsteps from a booming sound system, action packed, thrilling scenes along with something in it for the whole family to enjoy. You literally almost can't go wrong with a movie as long as you have some ferocious dinosaurs on the screen. Specifically Jurassic World itself, along with the rest of the older installments, have always made their dinos look amazing. Scientific evidence aside, these dinos look believable and very life like. The plot for this movie is solid, and goes back to Jurassic Parks original roots. A dinosaur theme park gone wrong. A dinosaur theme park, realistically, if it were to ever happen, would be INCREDIBLE. That in itself, is a reason why this is such a great movie to bring that to life. For this installment of the series though, the theme park looked phenomenal. It really makes you want to be right down there with everyone else inside of the park, exploring all the neat new things all about dinosaurs. Simply seeing the new park they have built for this movie in itself is ALSO another great reason to watch this. (and some cool throwbacks to the older JP as well)Jurassic World is a solid entry into the Jurassic Park collection, exceeding all of it's prequels and is on par, if not better than the original Jurassic Park. The movie is not perfect, however. It has some minor flaws and cheese moments with corny attempts at humor throughout. It's almost as if they were trying to ruin the intensity of the action/thriller scenes. I didn't want any of that thrill to be watered down or be broken up with humor attempts, I wanted to be at the edge of my seat the whole time. I know Jurassic Park movies have always thrown in a few jokes here and there before the action started to go down. However, I feel the original movies placed humor into the films a bit better without breaking the intensity. I literally almost cringed when Jimmy Fallon appeared in the movie, and as soon as he was on screen, everyone in the theater laughed. He didn't even do anything yet. He simply showed on screen, and everyone instantly laughed... why? But that was more of an audience of my own experience thing, and not the films fault. I couldn't laugh at the material anyway, because I was too focused on what was going to happen.Overall though, if you liked any of the Jurassic Park movies, go see it. If you want a good movie to go see with the family, go see it! If you just like movies with great action sequences and dinosaurs running rampant with some spectacular sequences and set pieces, I highly recommend this to go see in theaters. I know I personally will be anticipating the blu-ray release, as well as more Jurassic movies!",Jurassic World
1279,mionemobp,"Not as good as the first, but still amazing",8,11 June 2015,"It's not as good as the first one, obviously, because the first one is what set the bar. The way it was put together with the music of John Williams made it one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, as long as you go in with that knowledge, I think you will enjoy it. It's similar to the premise of the original - people go into park, dinosaur gets loose, people die, and the audience gets a thrill. It's similar in that respect. However, Jurassic World was a larger scale of that. There are more people in the park, the dinosaur that escapes is bigger and more vicious, and there are pterodactyls that escape. Add that with the larger crowds in the park, and you have complete and total chaos. Which is something that Jurassic Park had, but not on this scale. However, some scenes that refer to the original Jurassic Park (the main building, T-Rex smashing through the skeleton, and the T-Rex having the last roar in the film), remind us that while it is not just the same story, it is a continuation of the original. The thing that really disappoints me is that John Williams didn't compose for this film. However, Michael Giacchino follows him, and does it in such a way that you still feel connected in that aspect. Which why I only deducted 2 from here, instead of 5.",Jurassic World

This is definitely the only movie that belongs in the series with the original. With how disappointing both 2 and 3 were, I was worried going into this one but there was really nothing to complain about. Not once did I have the thought, ""why would you do that?"" That happens so often in the other two sequels and slightly in the original. The action sequences are fantastic and very clear. The acting is done well and so is the directing. My really only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. A little was cut out of the middle. But if the only complaint about a movie is that a little over 2 hours isn't long enough then you probably have a darn good movie. I also don't watch very movies in 3 but did with this and it was definitely worth it. It's a very pretty movie.

I just felt that some of the beats were maybe unearned occasionally.

It's a little sad that the franchise lost its seriousness to fall for the common-too-jocular strategy to gain the common viewer. Don't get me wrong, I love it when the script has jokes on it, it's playfully good experience. But it needs to have a good timing. It can't fall on the cliché to the mass, to the Transformers viewers' pleasure. There must be coherence and in-movie ""likelihood"" (because outside to inside likelihood, hmm, not so much applicable in sci-fi). There can't be a kiss whilst a bunch of people are being eaten right next to you by flying dinos. And while you have a huge chance of being eaten too. I mean, priorities, right? There can't be an anti-climax scene that breaks T-Rex's spotlight (OK, OK, she was stronger, but Mosasaurus was not even part of the fight). To be honest, the most thrilling parts were the ones that showed the functional park. I died a little every time I saw the attractions and thought to myself that I could watch a whole movie with no plot but to show a theoretical prehistoric park. God. Don't get me wrong, the movie is awesome. I love its purely good entertainment factor, but there's a but. It could have been the best of the franchise. It could have been my favorite action sci-fi. It could have. It isn't.",Jurassic World

A worthy sequel",8,3 April 2016,"I was more excited to watch the long awaited 3rd sequel to my favourite film ever, Jurassic Park, than i had been for any movie in years. Being a little obsessed with dinosaurs from a young age, and the franchise as it swept the world in 1993, this movie was a big deal to me.The movie has a different feel to the first three. It's obviously not Spielberg, but that's not a slight against it. I didn't find it as ""dark"". There is plenty of action, great characters and dialogue, and a lot of humour. I laughed a significant amount throughout. As with JP2 and JP3, unused plot was used from the two books, especially a big play on a plot line from the second book (carnotaurus camouflage).I think the buildup to the deaths weren't as suspenseful as JP. The *spoilers* guy shooting and running into the indominus's mouth was darkly hilarious. There were more than a few homages to the original, obvious and subtle.I loved every second of it. The score is not as pronounced, but is certainly there. The dinosaurs look ridiculously amazing. It is a Hollywood blockbuster, and so has certain predictable elements (more so if you know the films and books in depth).If you loved Jurassic Park, go see Jurassic World.

1286,theladywithbrains,Very good but more a remake of the first two movies than a sequel to the series.,7,3 June 2015,"Like it's dinosaur Frankenstein creation, Jurassic World is itself a  hybrid of sorts. A bright and vibrant opening that reminds the viewer  of the first time they saw the original Jurassic Park, with a voice  over by the late Richard Attenborough in introducing the park visitors  and the audience of the wonders of the first dinosaur amusement park.  Sort of a tribute to what the first movie was about and the realization  of it coming true. Then the mayhem begins and the viewer will remember  the words of Professor Ian Malcolm from the first sequel ""The Lost  World"": ""Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later  there's running and um, screaming."" That's what happens after the slow  introduction of the characters and story points of ""Jurassic World"".  What good about this film that it's a slow burn, like the first  Jurassic movie, then it kicks like a mule with the scares and adrenalin  of ""The Lost World"" when the park's new attraction starts eating the  tourist and it's fellow attractions. While having both Steven  Spielberg's original two films as inspiration is a good way to create a  Jurassic sequel, it's not original. Don't get me wrong, its very good  for what it was and Chris Pratt earns his stripes as a leading man but  takes too much from both ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" and just  regurgitating scenes here and there to be taken seriously as a sequel.  Plus it goes into overdrive with the scary,intelligent predator hybrid  dinosaur, which comes across more like ""Predator"" than a Jurassic Park  movie. This dinosaur hybrid kills for sport, not hunger or necessary  and that pushes the boundaries of what the Jurassic Park series was  about. Yes, they are wild animals but this film plays them up as good  guys and bad guys then the out of its time species that did not belong  into human society. With all of that out of my system, i will admit  that i did have a good time watching ""Jurassic World"" and jumped quite  a few times during a few scenes. A few inconsistencies a side, i  enjoying it as what it was. While there are obvious links to ""Jurassic  Park"" not to mention the fact that they are back to the original place  of the first film, i just did not feel like it was sequel to the  Jurassic Park series.

There was a general overall loss of color in the film with a washed out palette of color that I found very disturbing. Nor was the camera-work particularly good with scenes with objects obstructing the view. There was little originality in the film making, the director using a very hackneyed visual sense.Nor was the acting up to par of the earlier films. There was a general feeling of the actors not having rehearsed their parts sufficiently or the director not getting the best from them. Considering the film budget, I don't know why he didn't get better actors who knew their trade better.On the positive side, the character development made the story. Never mind the special effects of the reptiles killing, but the changes in personality were always the overlooked strong points of the Jurassic series. From the very first film in which the loquacious youngster matures into a more thoughtful, quiet person to this one in which the corporate hussy becomes a real person and the youngster changes from an impressionable tyke we see a steady progression of character change.As for the very last shot, the director's tribute to the T-Rex's return to lord of the jungle is a fitting commentary to the world they once ruled.",Jurassic World

My favorite childhood franchise is ruined, thank you Howard and Trevorrow . If jurassic par 3 is 5.9 rating on IMDb, this movie must be rated 0, stupid unfunny family action, with no suspense, no thrilling, no logic, with white mutant dinosaur who symbolized - new CGI Hollywood era, who is killing old Animatronic dinosaurs ( scene with dying Diplodocus). Studios used our favorite characters for making stupid 12+ movies for big box office like the main human antagonist of this picture.

1294,sleepinghoward,"Dear mother of god, Where is Jeff Goldblum when you really need him?",4,11 June 2015,"Before I get to sink my claws in what I think is very wrong with this film, I have to say upfront that it's an hell of a lot better film than ""Jurassic Park 3"" just for the glaring fact that ""Jurassic Park 3"" was that bad of a movie. So much so that poor Sam Neill can't live it down for the way the screenwriters ruined his character and the credibility of the series as a whole.Now we have part 4, which is called ""Jurassic World"" and while it's a major league improvement over the dismal ""Jurassic Park 3"", its still can't live up to the quality of what Spielberg achieved with the work he did with the first two Jurassic Park films ( The original and it's sequel ""The Lost World"".) This film takes place 22 years after the original and Jurassic World is fully operational but the mystic of dinosaurs has worn off and the resort needs a new attraction to bring in new customers. So they create a new dinosaur called the Indominus Rex, a leaner, meaner animal that is made to bring in and wow the crowds. At this point of the film for me when they introduce this monster, I can hear what Jurassic Park's mainstay Ian Malcolm would have said during this moment and it would not have been kind. If you remember the character of Ian Malcolm (played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum) he's pretty much the best character in the Jurassic Park films. The reason being is the fact that he not only represented what the audience was thinking during the films ( Well, the first two movies, not the god awful 3rd one) but was the voice of sarcastic reason and reality to John Hammond's flights of fancy. Too bad he's not around in this movie because he would be pretty much putting down almost every character in this film for their ignorance and stupidity, which was the audience's reaction in my theater through out this entire duration of the film. Chris Pratt plays pretty much the only likable character in the entire film and pretty much the only character with some brains in his head. That's a good thing considering that we would have no one to root for to at least survive the massacre that comes when the Indominus Rex finally and predictably goes on it's killing rampage. Bryce Dallas Howard really does not have much to do other than be surprised by her character's stupidity, which is a shame cause she really is a good actress and Vincent D""Onofrio is given a one note role which is a crime cause he's a damn fine actor. Throw in two of the most annoying kids ever to be stranded on a dinosaur resort ( (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) and you have a cast of characters who almost deserves to be dino chow. Despite the dumb characters and the leaps in logic and common sense, the movie does work as a entertaining time waster. There are some pockets of excitement to be had and the climax really does deliver the goods but this is all this film is about. It's really a monster movie, not a Jurassic Park film and while Chris Pratt gives us the only character in the film to root for, not even he can cover up the film's huge mistakes in story, logic and characterization.As the character of Ian Malcolm said to John Hammond in ""The Lost World"".John Hammond: ""Don't worry, I'm not making the same mistakes again."" Dr. Ian Malcolm: ""No, you're making all new ones.""This pretty much sums up Jurassic World as a whole.",Jurassic World
1295,kyle-ager,A nice surprise,7,26 October 2015,"This movie was somewhat surprising in that I went in having very low expectations. Is it as good as the original? Definitely not; however, it will send you on a nostalgia trip and put a smile on your face. Full of great action sequences and a ton of dinosaurs, both new and old, I'd highly recommend this film! The one con or slight downfall, if you consider it a downfall at all, is the lack of practical effects. Being young and very reminiscent of the original I just felt it lacked something. Although I must say a lot of the computer graphics were used great and helped create this fantasy world, it seemed to lack something and just wasn't the same as having something physically in front of the camera interacting with the actors. This is a small ""fanboy"" gripe if you want to call it that, and for younger audiences CGI has become the norm so overall I will finish by saying definitely check this one out!",Jurassic World
1296,akshay-ziller,"A Jurassic movie , with much of dialogs.. and less action !",6,13 June 2015,"Expectations from this movie were high. The tag name Jurassic was enough to attract audience, but the theatrical experience wasn't attractive at all. Movie was too predictive, just 20 minutes into the movie and you will know what is going to be in the end. The biggest turn off was, the time consumed in lengthy dialogs. At points I felt like Director is trying to make base line for future parts of the movie, rather than doing much for this one. There are few logical errors which any one would notice. Overall 'the movie was nice' statement could be made the final statement keeping in regard the VFX and 3D effects. But still, Jurassic World u could have done better. !",Jurassic World

This time however I already had my expectations set by all the heavy advertising and merchandising and trailers and word of mouth and so on and so on! It's very difficulty for movie makers these days to surprise - its not 'always' necessary but, every film should at least entertain and, or inform. Thankfully this sequel does entertain, more so than 2 of its 3 predecessors; Yes, I was pleasantly surprised too!! Thanks mainly to the underplayed acting ability of Mr Chris Pratt, the visual beauty, and acting of Ms Bryce Dallas Howard and the brilliant, still stunning, special effects. OK, so the impact isn't as awe inspiring as it was all those years ago, I would suggest the last 20 years of cinema magic has raised the bar a smidgen! As you'd expect plot-wise there isn't much to concern yourself with, the fear factor is minimal for a 'disaster/action' movie but it does have its moments. There is far less patronising dialogue than you may have been used to over the years, for this sort of film and the action scenes do come thick and fast, eventually, and none of it could be accused of being boring! Overall, if you leave your brain at the door and just hunker down for good old fashion 'adventure', you will probably end up seeing the 'attraction'.",Jurassic World

Did you have a long time black-out? How on earth did you manage to shoot such an deplorable movie? I am really shocked. This cannot be your aim to shoot such a bad movie without any wit or humor. Twenty years I have been waiting for something in the spirit of Sam Neill's humor. In this movie no humor whatsoever can be found. There is no story. There is no plot. Everything is incredible. Please give me one reason, why I should like this movie. This is no fun, it is a torture. It is the opposite of what I expected it to be: a cunning continual of the previous trilogy",Jurassic World

The movie in itself felt like a bad remake (even though it's a sequel) of the other movies. The synopsis is really similar to the other movies and it made me think that this movie is just a way to profit from a popular series. Nothing more. It will not give a lasting impression on me, and if it does, its a disappointing one. After I heard that Chris Pratt was gonna lead this, I felt excited. Not I just feel sad for seeing an actor I hold dearly do something so bad.**spoilers**The mistakes in the film made the whole experience so unsatisfying. There is so much unexplained, forgotten and weird small things in this movie that I do not know where to begin? There is a lot of emphasis on a super dino in the first part of the film, although in the second half - the dino possesses zero abilities. The walls keeping the dino secure is 12 m in hight. The dino itself is told to be up to 15. Whut? The motorcycles can drive all terrain, even terrain where the velociraptors have a hard time running through. Ugh... The movie might act like a nostalgic for some people. Hopefully, this is the end of money grabbing for this series. Let the Jurassic Park rest, or give it the wake up it needs.",Jurassic World

They're pretty forgettable and they don't deliver that much in terms of feel and personality, a few times they're funny, but yet, boring. The story is predictable of course, but in an excusable way, there are other new stuff about it that is great, it was a great opportunity to use the idea of having the park functioning and have customers visiting it for the first time ever, which added the level of entertainment on it, something that the previous films missed out on, and it gives us some new dinosaurs that are pretty cool like the main villain, the D Rex, and the water dinosaur.Hope this very first review of mine was helpful.",Jurassic World
1302,Aslinn,"Good movie, not as good as original (what a surprise)",9,7 July 2015,"Jurassic World is a satisfying addition to the franchise, and is definitely the second best in the 4 movies (Jurassic Park is still the best). It is great to see an the island of dinosaurs again, and the action is great. I also loved the nods throughout the movie to the original film, including the original building from the first film, as well as the jeeps. It's definitely worth watching if you were a fan of the first film like I was, and it is a bit of trip down nostalgia avenue watching a film like this again. Overall, the action, pacing and characters (minus the children) is all pretty good making it definitely worth watching.SPOILERS SECTION: Some of the aspects I didn't like though was the fact that they went the ""mad science"" route by creating a new dinosaur, which...I'm sorry to say would never fly in any scientific community/field etc. But in terms of the overall story it's fine, I mean, there are dinosaurs running around so I can forgive that part. It was much better seeing the raptors or t-rex again though. I also felt that some of the deaths seem unnecessarily cruel or gruesome considering the film rating. I was scared by just seeing the damn T- Rex as a kid, how the hell did other kids sit through some of this stuff? Even they made me feel uncomfortable, and I have watch my share of blood and gore movies. The main thing I didn't like was the subplot of ""weaponising"" dinosaurs, which felt so tired and forced. So many modern movies now have some kind of obvious villain trying to weaponise something. It's always supposed to be a shock as well, when it was not, at all. You mean, they guy talking about war and combat and wanting to use raptors in combat was behind the creation of the other dinosaur because they wanted to weaponise a dinosaur?! No! I am shocked!",Jurassic World
1303,TollingBells,You get what you expect.,3,14 June 2015,"A CGI infested stupid fest that fails to become anything of value. For some reason, Chris Pratt portrays his character like a cowboy, staring down dinosaurs. Apparently, velociraptors are just big and a little bit dangerous cattle whom the cowboy can easily control and train. Heat sensors can be deceived by a dinosaur and we can engineer then using genetic material from a buffet line that contains cuttle fish for some weird reason. Bryce Dallas Howard plays a whole bunch of stereotypes. The audience are treated to am insanely slow striptease and she pulls a Scarlett Johansson when she poses (tits and ass thrust out) with a flare, of all things. Not to be outdone the dumb/evil private security contractor is killed promptly after he assumes control of the park. The overall impression is of an African safari gone horribly wrong, filled with stereotypes, misogyny and one dimensional characters. The only thing missing is any sense of originality or well constructed drama.",Jurassic World
1304,faraz_mib,Best Blockbuster movie of Summer 2015!,9,12 June 2015,"I went into the theater expecting a half baked effort at yet another remake; some studio trying to rekindle the fire on an old classic. I left the theater on a high not experienced since watching Avatar. The makers of Jurassic World have done something truly inspiring by balancing the new with the old. They show us a theme park not much different than Universal Studios or Harry Potter; with this they show what the world has come to expect and give a sense of realism to the movie. They put in real life characters that show how 20 years have changed society. Smart phones, 2 second attention spans, big corporations after money and others looking to exploit science to build weapons. For the die hard fans, there's plenty of easter eggs and nods to the classic Jurassic Park. Those moments, when the theme song plays and a familiar tid bit appears on screen will make you fall in love all over again with the Jurassic Park universe. In my opinion, this is what really grounds Jurassic Park World (JPW). The plot is interesting and littered with humorous moments for the entire family to enjoy. I'm not exaggerating when I say there is not a single boring moment in JPW!A strong cast with good actors chosen for even type-cast roles made JPW's script believable and enjoyable. I felt each character was invested in his/her role. Standout performances from Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt and the young and energetic Ty Simpkins add so much energy and realism to the movie. Not to mention, Jake Johnson with his trademark wit and sense of humor delivers arguably the best lines in the movie which are nods to the classic JP and jibes at some of the evils in today's world.The ending was beautiful, chaotic and ever so enchanting. Jurassic Park World deserves to take the mantle from the original JP as THE dinosaur movie for the 21st century! I hope it inspires the same feelings of joy, humanity and humbleness in today's kids the way it did in me 20 years ago.",Jurassic World
1305,szilwike,"Great visuals, terrible storyline",1,4 July 2016,"The whole story seems very unlikely and lacks basic logic, from the beginning. I mean, why would someone create a huge invincible predator with a+ camouflage skills for entertaining purposes? I could understand that people would lose interest in ""regular"" dinosaurs after a certain amount of time, but no man in their right mind would come up with this solution in the real world. The army angle was textbook cliché, nothing new there, but the end scene, where the girl races the T-Rex in high heels really got me... just wow. I remember people laughing harder at this scene, than at any jokes in the movie. The love interest between the two protagonists seemed a bit awkward and forced. The same could be said about some of the dialogues. The visual effects on the other hand were flawless throughout the whole movie, but that's to be expected from a big studio picture. All in all, it looked great, but it didn't make me >feel< anything. I probably would't watch it again. Maybe without sound. With a cutout moustache taped to the screen. For fun.",Jurassic World
1306,joeywylder,Best sequel of the series,8,22 June 2015,"I say this is the best sequel out of the Jurrasic park series. With the original Jurrasic park, it sets the tone for its darkness, terror, fun and sheer volume of the task of bringing dinosaurs back to life, and also makes a great film experience in the process. Then we had The lost World, another movie that had the same elements and tone but lacked in story and development, and we could live with that, as we did. Then there was Jurrasic Park 3, the movie that we thought put the final nail in the coffin of the Jurrasic Park franchise. The movie, having nothing to do with its predecessors and essentially becoming a chaser movie between people and dinosaurs along with a ridiculous plot, was unnecessary in the franchise. Anyway that's what we had, and then came Jurrasic World. Jurrasic World was one of the most anticipated films of 2015 and it completely deliveres as a true Jurrasic park sequel. The movie takes elements from the first movie that we all love and adds new and fresh material that we can all understand. Altering genetics and having the park actually open and seeing how it operates is a new look into the world, but also having the love for the dinosaurs and sense of adventure is still all there. At first glance at the premise: people working along side velociraptors and other dinosaurs to take down a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, it all sounded a little ridiculous at first. In the end it was all justified by the massive scale and well thought out details of the evolution from the original movie of humans trying to control dinosaurs and failing in a new way. The awareness of the ties to the original Jurrasic Park failure and actuall ties to the park in the movie were a great addition to the already visually stunning movie. With a great cast and well acting, And a excellent rendition of the original score, it makes this a must see movie in theaters.",Jurassic World

Negative points: Everything else.The movie has bad acting, bad script, bad direction, bad lines. It's REALLY non-sense.Maybe if you're a fan of the original, you're going to give this one some credit, but this is a bad movie.The story doesn't stand. The characters don't react properly to deaths... they are just joking and laughing 2 minutes after people get killed shredded popping blood everywhere.... The movie has a good ambiance.. the CGI is decent.. but the lines, the acting and the way the storyline develops are terrible and ruins the movie.Wouldn't recommend even to my enemies.",Jurassic World
1308,Tony_Sylar,Nice visuals. Terrible characters/story.,5,15 April 2018,"Jurassic World is shockingly rewatchable. Before I started watching it I was dreading the thought of it, since I didn't thought much of the film the 1st time I saw it. But as soon as it started, it wasn't that bad.I still don't think the film is good. It's certainly terrible when it comes to story and characters, but it's pretty well put together in the technical departments. Like the sets, the locations. The park in Jurassic World feels like a real park. Something that exists and it's physically possible for me to visit.
And that's such a breath of fresh air, especially when you start thinking about all those Marvel and DC films. Take Black Panther for instance. Comparing Wakanda or even the scenes in South Korea with anything from Jurassic World, and Black Panther comes out losing, because it's scenery looks fake as sh**. While here, everything looks nice, clean and authentic.Jurassic World as great production value. Something that's important if you want your film to look good. Now, where the film fails where others might succeed is: in the direction, the characters, the tone and the plot.Wanting to use Raptors in a real like war scenario and believing that Raptors would be better than modern technology is stupid. It makes no sense. If you were talking about dropping a few Raptors in an enemy camp in order to create chaos, then yes. That makes sense. But wanting Raptors to team up with soldiers and thinking this is better than using some piece of technology... Its just stupid.For some reason everyone treats this new dinosaur has some kind of Godzilla type threat. Something that's impossible to destroy even with nuclear weapons. And when you see her getting easily wounded when a missile barely hits her... You start realizing that maybe the problem isn't the fact that this dinosaur is smarter than the others. Maybe the problem is that the people in charge of the park are really bad at their jobs. Like, they are the most incompetent idiots you could ever have hired.And the tone is all over the place. Between the nostalgic soundtrack and the park, which is meant to make you remember that feeling you had when you saw the original. You have forced humour that reminds you of Disney films. Violent animal attacks that are presented in this visceral, gritty realistic way. Something that just doesn't mix with the childish characters and stupid one-liners. It just becomes awkward. The film becomes a giant, bloody mess of different ideas, each one executed in a different way.Giving it a 5/10.",Jurassic World

The attention to detail is much cooler than Jurassic Park admittedly, however, the charm of Jurassic Park is that we get so immersed in the story line that we forget the slightly poorer animations. The movie was epic and managed to play on several ideas like taming the raptors and using dinosaurs as part of the military. The higher tech also widens the imagination on the possibilities of the future.Now here comes the bad part. There was lesser enthusiasm felt and the people less fear-stricken. Was it just me or were the dinosaurs smaller than in Jurassic Park? For the sake of young or old audiences, perhaps the sound was toned down. However, the deafening roar of the t-rex was what made the movie seem so much more realistic.Some after movie thought, it is likely that the t-rex, Mosasaurus, and raptors might go extinct as there were only one of each left behind after the end of the show. Hopefully they do not create a sequel like Jurassic Park did.This movie is definitely better in cinemas so I highly recommend people to view it in Imax 3d.

1315,JGrayDingler,Mess of mashed up scripts drags down what would have been otherwise a fairly average summer blockbuster.,2,18 June 2015,"Jurassic World marks the triumphant return of the Jurassic Park series to the big screen after following a fourteen year absence, and mostly it just reminded me of why I haven't really been yearning for another Jurassic Park sequel in that time. Seeing the commercials I expected a big, dumb, fun movie. The dumb was plentiful, the big felt lacking, and the fun sparse. Sadly, watching Jurassic World seemed to disapprove the presumption I based my ticket purchase on, which was it must be a marked improvement over the previous two Jurassic Park movies.Ignoring the many script problems, Jurassic World's biggest failing is it just didn't pack much wow factor for me. There's little craft in introducing the audience to what's both the film's and park's main attractions. With dinosaurs simply being there with no attempts to build tension and characters in the film constantly repeating how they're no longer exciting, which feels less like a joke and more like an admission of failure as even after everything inevitably goes wrong, there's still not much to get excited about.Even the trailer's much hyped super beast, the Indominus rex, appears to us clearly in broad daylight with little fanfare as just a T-Rex with raptor arms painted a dull gray and devoid of any of the charm or personality of either dinosaur it's loosely based on. And even the reintroduction of those classic carnivores pales in comparison to their original reveals. There's no real build up like the famous slow unveil of the T-Rex from the original film, or the tension the Velociraptors created from quickly and methodically tracking its prey.Other dinos fair no better as they're largely just window dressing in the background, beneath introductions or any significant screen time outside of generic hazards, such as the flying dinosaurs who escape the aviary, only to randomly attack and breaks things for a while before simply disappearing from the film. I'm not a fan of The Lost World or JP III, but the former did have an effective top down shot of the hapless humans being surrounded by raptors as they crept silently through the tall grass to their clueless prey, and the later featured a fairly memorable unveiling of the pteranodon as it sulked out of the fog while walking on its wing tips, giving it an oddly alien look.The lone exception and one of Jurassic World's few saving graces is the mighty mosasaur, who even in the context of the film, inspires awe from the otherwise jaded older brother character, and whose incredible scope was featured prominently on one of the movie's posters. The mosasaur steals all three scenes it's in, ultimately upstaging the film's cast, human or otherwise, in its final appearance, and all with probably only a combined minute of screen time. By contrast, the Indominus rex never rises above something akin to an unmemorable boss from a video game, and whose intelligence and abilities amount to little more than it simply shrugging off attacks.Weighing down the fairly unremarkable novelty factor is the story, which suffers from an overabundance of undeveloped ideas as well an unneeded focus on the script's weakest elements. There's some interesting potential in possible parallels between the park and Sea World or a crazy military character wanting to use dinosaurs to win wars. But a large portion of the first thirty minutes, as well more scenes in the later acts, are devoted to the park's business workings, establishing the little brother likes dinosaurs while the older one doesn't care, and how Bryce Dallas Howard's character doesn't pay enough attention to her nephews.Howard's character in particular has an absurd amount of scenes focused on her subplot involving her sister's kids. With the boys' mother calling her at one point to literally cry about her neglect of them just in time for said boys to be stranded somewhere in the park so she can race to them in her pristine Mercedes and repeatedly stress to Chris Pratt just how hard she's going to rescue them. It's very reminiscent of the previous sequels insistence on using cheap family melodrama to pad for time, and fails to achieve the first film's more subdued approach, where Dr. Grant's dislike of children is covered in a few amusing scenes and is resolved by showing him tenderly holding Lex and Tim after the three had to endure hell together all movie.A lot of plot points and characters are dropped or even completely forgotten, and sometimes even contradict each other. One plot ""twist"" is that the Indominus can communicate with raptors comes long after a scene where Chris Pratt tells the audience that animals raised in isolation don't develop social skills and can't communicate because they have nothing at all to communicate with or learn from. Then Pratt's commanding officer insists dinosaurs are the future of military missions, after attempting to use them in this fashion backfired hilariously and resulted in almost everything dead, except the one thing they were trying to kill.Surprisingly the whole dinosaur whisperer thing is actually handled relatively well. The movie depicts him realistically as a trainer of dangerous animals, who develops a relationship and trust with the animals, but doesn't command them. Sadly, the only pay off for this is for the finale where the raptors' loyalty to Pratt turns them back to the human side of the force just in time for the big dumb dinosaur fight that makes up the climax.It's not worth nitpicking Jurassic World to death though, because ultimately it's not a terrible film, just sub-par, which sadly puts it in the same place as The Lost World and Jurassic Park III for me. Unlike those movies, Jurassic World did have some fresh ideas mixed in, but it never seemed to realize how to exploit them and ultimately is just an inoffensive but forgettable summer popcorn flick.",Jurassic World
1316,moarora24,"Jurassic World has its blockbuster moments, but not impactful as Jurassic Park",7,12 June 2015,"Assets being fed, Assets being controlled, Assets in containment, Assets out of containment. Calling dinosaurs as ""assets"" is such an understatement. As Dr. Alan Grant in the '93 original said, ""Can't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct."", the same holds true even today. John Hammond has passed on the baton of the park to Mr. Masarani, very well portrayed by Irrfan. The park now is bigger and better two decades later. Instead of the tour cars, we have tour gyrospheres; there is dolphin show style dinosaur show (of course sans the dance), there are interactive screens and elephant-like dinosaur rides for kids and the control room is much more technologically advanced. And well, the dinosaur too is meaner and hence the name : Indominous Rex. Because people want something with more teeth and something ""bigger, better and louder"".The makers fully achieve what they wanted to achieve in terms of the visual appeal. The park, the facilities, the array of creatures all look sublime. Some of the moments in the Spielberg version like the one where T-Rex crushes the car with kids trapped inside them have been recreated as per the latest setup which do bring back the nostalgia. There are enough blockbuster moments involving the I-Rex, Raptors and other dinosaurs to keep you at the edge of the seat. Claire's assistant being thrown around by dinos and the climax sequence are two such which need special mention. And Indominous Rex is one bad ass dino with capabilities of couple of other creatures (including T-Rex) all rolled into one. Yeah, take that T-Rex!Chris Pratt is a stud. He doesn't look one bit the researcher he portrays esp when he is riding that bike, but carries off his character with a charm and wit at times. Irrfan as Mr. Masarni is a cool customer. He is an upright park owner and a cool pilot. Though his chopper passengers are afraid when he is the pilot but he has always ""got it"" :)Since its a reboot, comparisons with the Spielberg version are inevitable. Claire realises it quite early in the movie that ""No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore"". Jurassic Park had a big first player advantage. And with Spielberg at its helm, it fully played to its advantage thereby creating some scenes which are etched into our memory to date. Jurassic World on the other hand fails to create that big an impact. And it has its fare share of plot holes like missing an effective evacuation plan for a park this big, and the park owner approving certain things without his knowledge. Further, the first half doesn't really create those wow moments which the '93 version did. And I totally failed to understand why Irrfan's character has been given that puffy-eyed, unshaven and tired look. Being an owner, he could have been presented in a much better way.However, its the second one hour and especially the last half an hour which really lifts the whole movie. I watched it in 2D but I think 3D could be better given the scenes involving dinos are not chaotic. Plus one might enjoy the scale of the park better in 3D.In a nutshell, Jurassic World can be watched for its blockbuster moments despite the fact that it doesn't leave the same impact as Jurassic Park did.P.S. : Don't watch it with your 5 year (or less) old kids , the I-Rex and the Raptors can be very scary to them :)*Spoiler Alert* T-Rex and the Raptors have their Godzilla moment in the climax which leads to another recreated scene in the end from the '93 saga :)",Jurassic World

However, it has a lot of ""new"" to choose from; a functioning park, the Mosasaur is neat (we'll get to that bit at the end later) and the I. Rex, for what its worth, is a unique, dangerous 'villain' dinosaur. The tamed raptors—which I'll get to— were a bold move, & World puts the series in ""new"" genre On the note of characters: I think we all view JP with Rose tinted glasses; it is my favorite movie, and while I enjoyed Lost World and don't have half the vitriol for JP III as some, I fully admit that the series has been on a definitive retrograde in quality. However, World's characters are not far off the norm. The child characters, in my opinion, are less like helpless baggage to weigh down the adults as in JP, and their sibling dynamic is just as good, if not better, than Lex and Tims; they felt like actual brothers, as opposed to child actors reading lines. They manage to mostly take care of themselves for a large portion of their story (the only good part of Eric Kirby's character from III), and actually have a good reason for being there (The Lost World and III.) In their final fight against raptors they survived using wit & available resources; not once did they use gymnastics to kill a velociraptor. Onto the Velociraptors. I was of two minds about their domesticated nature going into it; on the one hand, they were the calculating, ruthless villains of the first two movies. They even set sadistic traps in III, but that's where they were also shown to have sophisticated group dynamics and care for their unborn young, as animals would have. This, coupled with the imprinting scene in JP, foreshadows tamed velociraptors. It's not quite as ludicrous as disgruntled viewers would suggest; we've not only tamed a species of highly intelligent pack hunters before, but we did it so well that some of their descendants are now called Chihuahuas. The idea that a group of raptors could be tamed, and only barely so (remember, they were going to eat the new worker in their first scene, almost ate Owen, and killed several mercenaries later), by an expert is actually an entirely feasible possibility. In the novels, rival firm BioSyn intended on making miniaturized pet versions. This is a universe where we can clone dinosaurs; the equivalent of a tamed tiger isn't out of the question, and sets up excellent dinosaur action. Speaking of dinosaur action; this movie does what none of the others did: Really good dinosaur fights. We finally get a herbivore battle; the I. Rex fighting an anklyosaurid, and while it's not the iconic T-Rex vs Triceratops fight I've been waiting for since I was four, it was actually quite good. The scene with the dead/dying ""long necks"" was surprisingly emotional for me, I'm not the sentimental type with movies. The Pteranodons attack was good if CGI heavy; and showcased one of the only things that World did better than the other films: Humans with guns are not helpless; Pteranodons did a lot of damage to the extras, and killed off the British assistant in spectacular fashion, but were quickly put down by trained persons with weapons. The raptor-vs-I.Rex fight at the climax was another callback to the original, but reversed; an echo I enjoyed. The sudden turnaround of the raptors didn't bother me either; they are pack animals, a new alpha showed up, and they changed allegiance. This lead to a callback to the ""long grass"" scene from Lost World. However, as Owen himself points out, the raptors and he have a relationship; they are loyal to him. The raptor that gets killed via rocket launcher stopped its rampage because it wasn't targeting him. Their change of heart and fight with the I. Rex isn't cheesy, it's a Vader-kills- the-Emperor moment. It's foreshadowed and allows for, again, that mirror of the JP Finale. And then: ""We have a T-Rex."" Bringing out the big gun to take on the I. Rex not only doubly referenced JP, with the T-Rex acting as the anti-hero, but it allowed for the series to redeem itself from the Spinosaurus victory in JPIII (which, in an aside, would have ended as soon as the T-Rex got its jaws onto the Spinosaurus' neck). The raptor-Rex tag team, while a little over the top, was the fun kind of over the top, and also not beyond reason. JPIII showed that the Rex was very territorial; it did not like another apex predator in its territory; the I. Rex was near to its paddock; and as such it would fight. The Raptor was fighting for Owen, and because it was justifiably angry at being swatted by the I. Rex and for the I. Rex killing its siblings. The T-Rex wasn't working with the raptor; it was just fighting its real enemy. The Raptor was coordinating its attacks (pack hunter, smarter than dolphins and primates). It was a great conclusion, save for its slightly goofy Mosasaur finale (also foreshadowed.) My main criticism is it lacking the depth and scientific ideas, but even then they finally lampshade why the dinosaurs aren't scientifically accurate; something even JP didn't do. In all, World was a good sequel; familiar but new, with plenty of callbacks to the original and what was best about the sequels, but in its own way. It wasn't the cerebral thriller of the original, or attempting to recreate formula like the other sequels; it was an action movie. And that's okay.",Jurassic World
1318,coen_dutz,"Best Jurassic Park sequels ever, period",10,10 June 2015,"JURASSIC WORLD (Spoiler-Free review) *still cant contain my excitement even after i left the cinema few hours ago*So the film begins similar to the original Jurassic Park movie, scary and awesome. Introducing us to the movie's main villain like the first movie. The movie slowed down a bit from there, showing family drama that i don't really care at first but grow significantly throughout the movie. The main character is not Owen, contrary to public's belief, its Claire. This shows claire evolution from a whiny corporate drone to a strong, fast thinking, and bad ass woman.. Zach and Gray in my opinion, was twice better than lex and tim, their relationship really shows here, how the older brother treat his younger brother, and conflict between them and how they are really different but united through the film. Owen also do a lot to the plot, and his interaction and relationship with raptor are complicated, OWen really loves them, but they are animal, unpredicted. The human cast are wonderful, even the stereotypical villain like hoskin who eventually shows his true colour. They are all well acted, stereotypical at some, but well acted.And the dinosaurs are good too,the effects,the scenery, and they are well ""acted"" too so to speak.. THey behave like real animal, move like them, and sorry, die like real animal. This movie will make you hate indominus,not because of the dino itself but her personalities, she is a jerk and a buly. Boy i hate her so much.And GOD the trailer are awful compare to the movie. It plays with emotion and nostalgia. Some momment really make me tearing up, some are funny, and most of them are intense and scary as hell. Its not non- stop like Transformers, but beautifully directed and the action are logical and soo natural, the dino moves so smoothly and the cgi is... wow, almost cat tell the difference between animatronics and CG, not almost, i really cant tell the difference. BEAUTIFUL movie!! I know all you guys will ask me ""how the final battle? is it epic?"" Guys, washed your brain from the awful dino fight from JP 3, the fight is brutal, gory but natural and very smooth..Just like seeing 2 lions fighting for dominance, and there is a pleasant surprise in the end of the movie.. This is definitely one of the best summer movies of 2015 ever!! AND BETTER THAN THE OTHER SEQUEL!! WOrds of advice, watch it in 2D or normal 4D because the 3D will make the movie a bit darker, but still beautiful nonetheless..JURASSSIC WORLD IS...Awesometacular!!9.2/10!",Jurassic World
1319,chris47601,Could have been worse...definitely better than 3,6,12 June 2015,"First, I am the biggest Michael Crichton fan. I have read nearly everything he has ever written. So, the bad comes first - 1. Some of the characters (dinos included) did not fit the mold for his writing. While I found them likable, I also found them detestable as a ""Crichton snob.""2. I felt like there was too much in the way of homages. A few subtle nods would have been sufficient, imo. Other minor things like overall story development, and a few other directorial issues aren't worth dwelling on in light of a 2 hour and 10 minutes run time.The good - 1. Chris Pratt was excellent. I'm quickly becoming a fan, and hope he can develop his skills a bit more for future roles. As my wife pointed out, he'd make a great fit for an indiana Jones reboot if the time comes.2. The dinos were awesome. Even the new ones, as far-fetched as they seem. In this regard, the writing was right in line with Crichton. He loved to stretch the science to the very edge of being illogical, if not impossible.3. Did I mention ALL of the homages? Many casual viewers will miss most of them. My 11 year old got a bunch but not all of them. From that standpoint, I like being able to see some of the more subtle connections, and rides down memory lane are generally enjoyable.Conclusion - Overall, I felt like it was worth the matinée admission of 7.50. I wouldn't have wanted to pay 10, but others may disagree. Solid action film....3.5 stars.",Jurassic World
1320,khan-abhinandan,An appropriate sequel to the class that is Jurassic Park,10,24 June 2015,"Jurassic Park was the first movie that I watched in the theatre (or otherwise) at the age of 4. I was so scared that I could not finish the entire film. However, with time it became one of my favourites. Now, 22 years after, I went to see Jurassic World today in 3D! I loved it and enjoyed it thoroughly. I am not an expert on CGI and similar stuff. However, the landscape looked beautiful and detailed. The dinos were better than JP2 and JP3. Decent storyline and acting, nothing mindblowing but thoroughly entertaining. One thing noticeable is the characterisation of the creatures themselves as sort of antiheroes and villains of the movie, a theme highlighted in last year's Godzilla reboot also! Anyways, I found it more enjoyable than Avengers AOU. There were a few set pieces that drew a huge cheer from the nearly full house audience (especially the scene before the interval and the climax). Deducted two ratings because it is not the original 1993 film, and the T-rex only has a special appearance. Other than that an overall very good dino movie and is worth the money spent!!",Jurassic World
1321,emailbrijesh,Way below expectation,5,14 June 2015,Watched this movie in 3D despite warned by friend that the movie is not so good.The story was very dull and predictable. No surprising special effects.Nothing special on acting front.Can be considered as family movie or movie for Kids. Earlier movies were way better.Felt like wasted my time and money on this movie.

1322,Remus-Lupus,Just what i expected!,8,11 June 2015,"I saw it yesterday and i must say it fulfilled my expectations. An spectacular specie of remake/tribute/sequel of the original JP.You can tell the vision of the director and also how much of a fun time he must have had while filming the movie. It has also a pretty 90s feeling to it (a la Mad Max Fury Road), a lot clichés and exaggerated situations that seems to go back a few decades ago but done in such self-aware way and in such a cool one also that the final product ends up being top notch. The movie is also full of all kind of references to the first movie.Bryce Dallas Howard is a goddess and Chris Pratt a really charismatic guy. Also Michael Giacchino makes epical use of the old classical themes of the saga as well as introducing a new one that even though is not as good as the old ones it fits really well (but it is strangely pretty similar to one of the main musical pieces of the Italian movie ""Life is Beautiful"").In any case the movie is not free from some problems with it script but luckily those problems are not strong enough to be able to make the return of the park an entertaining as hell ride in its entire dimension.",Jurassic World
1323,garret619,Nostalgia? Indominus Rex is a metaphor,1,19 June 2015,"In Greek, nostalgia literary means ""A pain from an old wound"". And that is exactly what I feel after watching this movie.Indominus Rex is a metaphor, if you didn't know. The roid-rage dinosaur represents the money hungry studios that make blockbuster bullshit and love regurgitating it all over our back sides, only to be bending us over at the same time and taking it from behind, reassuring us that our money was well spent. We should be ashamed as the viewers and movie patrons to allow such a mockery of THE great classics. Quick, let me bite into a raw meat patty to get this bad taste of movie out of my mouth. TOP 5 - CLUES, REASONS & COMMON SENSE TO WHY THIS MOVIE SUCKS.1. NOBODY FROM THE PAST MOVIES WERE IN THE FILM?!? Sorry BD Wong, you should stick to Mulan & Seven Years In Tibet. Really Sam Neil???Joseph Mazzello?? REALLY??2.CGI. Way to much CGI. The guy who made the real life robotic dinosaurs died after the 2nd installment of the franchise. Simple solution: Find the someone who can make the dinosaurs or don't make the film. Also, if you couldn't tell this movie was sponsored by Mercedes. And a fraction of Starbucks....Thank you product placement.3. Chris Pratt....More like Burt Macklin to save the day and the dinos!! Don't get me started on the fake ass Jeff Goldblum protégé played by Jake Johnson....4. Steven Spielberg isn't directing! Huh? Shouldn't that be a sign right there? I guess after the 3rd installment went extinct after opening weekend just wasn't the answer. Why would you ever think this would be good if he, STEVEN SPIELBERG, isn't directing it?? To much of a good thing is bad people, stop rebooting and start being creative & original.5. There are TWO things that are free when it comes to making movies on any scale. GREAT WRITING & GREAT ACTING. Something which everyone who made this film possible forgot to do. Stop hunting for the dollar sign AND hunt for the originality that lies in within.ALL IN ALL, INSTEAD OF ENGINEERING A NEW DINOSAUR, HOW ABOUT ENGINEERING A BETTER MOVIE.",Jurassic World
1324,thece1992,Great movie,9,26 July 2015,"This was a great movie. I recommend it for older viewers. There are parts that can scare younger kids, so if you have younger kids might not be the best movie to watch with them. Other then that it had lots of action, lots of dinosaurs, and some mystery in the movie. The plot was pretty good with the old dinosaurs and some newer dinosaurs. I really enjoyed this movie and think that people that liked the Jurassic park movies should give this movie a try. This movie is definitely worth going to see in the theater. I hope that they make more movies in this series. I like the addition of the fact that they added some newer dinosaurs to this movie. I helps to make the movie more of a fresh movie. I also like that the raptors actually help out the humans that live on the island. Some of the newer attractions and transportation also help to make the movie a more modern feeling. I would recommend this to all my friends and family with old enough kids or if they liked Jurassic park.",Jurassic World
1325,tsoiyanpui,ridiculous!,3,19 May 2020,"Action and adventure movies like this one is always fun to watch.
But this one is so ridiculous in many ways, like kids missing but no one thought of calling them on their cell phone, breaking cell phones signals all the time, broadcast only comes on and creating panic the last second before all the flying dinosaurs are coming in to hurt people, the boys knowing they are in a park with certain level of danger but would happily head into the restricted area...
but one of the worst parts is Bryce Howard is on her heels the whole time during all the chase and all the running around! REALLY?! ARE YOU SERIOUS? At least have her changing into a pair of sneakers whenever she has the chance right?!",Jurassic World
1326,rlittle-576-506659,A Great Addition to the Franchise,9,15 June 2015,"I went into this movie with high expectations which is surprising, as I wasn't convinced that Chris Pratt had the Star Power to pull it off. Yes I realized that he was the lead in Guardians of the Galaxy, but he was kind of goofy in that, and I still know him mostly from Parks and Rec. and I just didn't see Andy as the leader of a pack of Velociraptors. (We saw that in the Trailers so most would agree that it is not a spoiler)Anyway my concerns aside, I was a big fan of the original Jurassic movies, and I couldn't wait to see this one.Boy am I glad I did. The movie was great. I'm not sure how those not familiar with the original will feel about this one, but how many people of movie going age are not? It's been available on Video for like 15 years, so if you are old enough to get into this one, the chances are you at least saw it at a friends house.The movie was beautiful, generally well acted, and most importantly gave us the chance to have the question of ""what might have happened if they had been able to actually open the park?""The answer of course was given to us in Lost World in the form of a quote from Ian Malcolm. ""Oh, yeah. Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and um, screaming.""Andy, I mean Starlord, I mean Chris Pratt did just fine. They left the door wide open for the sequel, and I'm sure that I will see that one on opening weekend as well.",Jurassic World
1327,Thor_Rose,Dinosaur Island 4: Rise of the Superdino,3,21 September 2015,"Starring: Gracious harmless long-necks, ominous mega-dolphin, ravenous flock of flying raptors, and the velocidogs. Featuring: 2 dimensional characters, surrealistic circumstances, every cliché in the book, and a condescending script. Directed by the monopoly guy. Here are the characters: Jaded teenage boy, enthusiastic nerd kid, crying mom, cynical dad, do-no-wrong hero, high-heels, fat warmonger who gets eaten by poetic justice, mysterious mad-scientist, eccentric billionaire and token black guy. Location: Ludicrous dinosaur theme-park with no evacuation plans, labor union, or government regulation. This movie will warn you about the forthcoming dangers every step of the way, and the frankly insulting lack of originality doesn't leave you surprised at anything. (Except for the mega-dolphin joining the T-Rex/superdino/velocidog fight... That was so dumb I actually didn't see it coming.)The film also features the new blockbuster trend where the dialogue is barely audible, while the sound effects and theme music is blasted at you with a rocket-fueled cannon. Probably to disguise the fact that the dialogue sucks. Speaking of theme music, I don't believe I have seen it so arbitrarily and inappropriately used since 007 checked into his hotel room in ""From Russia with Love"". No character development, except high-heels cries once, kisses the hero and is perfectly happy the day after hundreds of people died thanks to their naivety.3/10 stars. 1 star for the good cinematography. 1 for the stunning special effects and animation. 1 for the actors who tried their best.

1328,happycheese53,"If you're looking to sit on the edge of your seat for two hours, welcome!",10,14 September 2015,"First of all I think people need to understand that film is a lot like music, you can't listen to a new Justin Bieber song and complain because it's not a Mozart masterpiece. And you definitely can't watch Jurassic World expecting a mind-boggling, emotional Inception type film. I would put Jurassic World in the same category as most Michael Bay films, the story line won't make you think, the characters won't go through any psychological changes but you will be thoroughly entertained by the special effects. I think it's fairly obvious throughout the original trilogy and this film that we are the visitors to the attractions, Steven Spielberg gave the parallel Earth a new unimaginable attraction, one which surprised the audience so much, it's rated as one of the best films ever. Period. Fast forward twenty two years past the films of Interstellar, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, we as a human race have seen a lot of original, unique things, a plain old dinosaur film will not bring us the same thrills as it did in 1993. Therefore we are once again, the visitors to the attraction. We will never feel the same buzz as first seeing that T-Rex crashing the gates over, or the same chill down the neck when first hearing that Raptor shriek. However, we can still be entertained. Which is what happens throughout the film. The characters are fairly bland, there are only a couple likable ones, but they all seem to grow on you near the end, the bloodbath that is left by the new Dino is quite emotional and gives you a side to pick fairly easily, the surprises throughout the film keep it exciting and the special effects, well we are in 2015 and they did have a lot of money to spend so lets just say they are incredible as expected. If you're looking to be on the edge of your seat for two hours and trust the film to not bore you, then you have nothing to worry about, the line graph representing excitement just climbs up and up, if you're expecting another Shawshank Redemption, well please don't slate the film when it doesn't satisfy your needs. I think that films should have two ratings, one for overall, and another for it's main sub-category, for example as an overall film I'd give it a 7.5-8, it's sub-category of excitement I'd give a solid 10, a comparison to the first Transformers which I'd give an 8 for excitement and a 5 overall. Therefore I really do recommend this film for anyone who like me, enjoys special effects, good excitement and two hours to just sit on the edge of my seat and thoroughly enjoy my time. I can only say I can't wait for the second one and I'm sure you will too after you watch it.",Jurassic World
1329,curveball323-619-382634,Sub Par Film of the Jurassic Park Series,5,25 June 2015,First of all this film doesn't follow much of the story from the first Jurassic Park and the Sequel The Lost World. That's Fine i'm open to new ideas and stories. But my one major major complaint about this film is it lacks drama and suspense. For an example in the first Jurassic Park you never got to see the T-Rex at first. it never showed up to feed on the goat then the storm moved in and the power was cut right when they were passing the fence of the T-Rex on the way back. It was raining and Dark and each cable to the fence snapped one by one and still you never got to see the T-Rex. then finally BAMMM he emerges the girls trying to compose herself shaking and gasping for breath while trying not to get eaten. That is DRAMA and SUSPENSE. Jurassic World has no Drama nor suspense. just a dinosaur that can cloak himself from thermal imaging and camouflage himself which he uses ONE TIME during the ENTIRE MOVIE!!! They don't mask his appearance with a storm or with anything really he just appears and starts killing people. happens during the day and no one is really scared they all have blank emotionless responses to seeing him. The film lacks critical suspense due to the fact that you won't feel scared because the actors aren't scared. The story is decent it's much much better than Jurassic Park III but lacks everything that even The Lost world brought to us. I was more frightened in the Lost world then I ever was in this movie in fact it almost seems more of a comedy than a action thriller. Don't take my word for it go see it yourself. one last thing the training of the raptors in my opinion is just bull crap you really think that a raptor is going to respect and obey a human... come on!!!,Jurassic World
1330,ManBagBlog,The franchise is lucky this movie didn't come out first,6,14 June 2015,"I went to Jurassic World with high expectations, but was underwhelmed.I recently had the pleasure of seeing Jurassic Park again on television. Scenes such as the T-Rex in the wing mirror, the car 'chasing' the child down the tree, rapidly alternating between humour and suspense as Sam Neil leads the children over the electric fence; this was Spielberg at his very best from start to finish. Sadly, all that directorial guile has been thrown out the window in Jurassic World in favour of relentless action and great special effects, and the movie is worse for it.It's not a terrible movie, but it says something about the acting and direction that I wound up caring more about the dinosaurs than I did about the principle characters. If Jurassic World had come first with 1990's sfx, I doubt the franchise would have anything like the popularity it now does.",Jurassic World
1331,faisal_bmw,Do not go in expecting it to be like the original 3,7,14 June 2015,"(MINOR SPOILERS)So I'll start by saying that I should have taken some advice and should have gone in with lower expectations because when I walked out I was disappointed, but that is only because I was trying to compare it to the original 3 movies which I should have known better because I knew going in it wouldn't be anything alike. Usually I tell myself to wait till the next day to rate it because normally it is higher when I sleep on it. The movie was very predictable I knew what was going to happen before it happened, although a plus would be that I loved all the references they had from the previous movies, but again I was never ""wowed"". Till the first half of the movie my rating barely hit 5/10, it had a dull start; also there were many other flaws that could have been fixed but again it's a movie. Things that got on my nerves: (spoiler alert) - how can that 8 year old kid get that original Jurassic Park jeep working after sitting idle for 22 years? Also, the raptors being trained (though shown in the trailer). Meh. I prefer it to be dinosaurs vs humans not dinosaurs and humans vs dinosaurs. Also those kids had a hundred chances to run instead they just stare at the big dinosaurs. And what was the deal with the older brother? Why was he so grumpy the entire time? The action however was superb and because of that the movie got a passing grade, otherwise it would have hovered at the 5-6/10 mark. The acting was average at best, some did above average and some below average. Overall, it was exciting (second half) action packed movie. Still - nothing compared to the original. Min grade: 6.0/10 Max grade: 7.0/10 My current grade: 6.5/10",Jurassic World
1332,theamazingsammyman,As good as the original.,9,10 June 2015,"I went into Jurassic World as a dinosaur lover and was so hyped up about the film. After countless of TV spots, 3 or 4 trailers and a handful of clips I couldn't be more excited. I went into the cinema and it started off good and hit me straight in the nostalgia factor with the scene where they enter the gate and the music that started playing when Grey opened the curtain of his hotel room. The Film has very good action scenes and some scene's where you want to cry your eyes out. When the one raptor looks up to Owen and is happy to see him but then InGen blows the raptor up. The fight scenes between dinosaurs were amazing! The I-Rex vs the T-Rex and Blue was amazing and it was not really a surprise that the Mosasaur would be back for a final scene as well. When the raptors went kinda crazy it was a cool little bit of action. Same with the anky/I-Rex fight and the Aviary escape. For the characters now. In my opinion Simon Masrani was kind of a John Hammond character. He didn't care all that much about money he cared mostly about the animals and the customers satisfaction. All the characters are very good and Claire was great. I loved her character. While I couldn't stand Zach at the start he really grows on you. Ty Simpkins as Grey is just lovable! And of course there is Chris Pratt one of the highlights of this movie. Vincent as Hoskins was kind of meh. His reasoning behind what he did is never fully explained. While the story seems to be all over the place at some points it's easily forgiven by all the action, lovable characters and the film will have you at the edge of your seat for a solid 2 hours. It's as good if not better as the original Jurassic Park. Collin Treverrow should be proud of this masterpiece. It's better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park and of course Jurassic Park 3. Once again it's a beautiful movie and everyone will find enjoyment in it. Especially the final fight. Although I'll say the raptors didn't have to die. They were so cute! I give this a solid 9/10! Didn't give it a 10 because of the story being all over the place at times. 'Life uh, Finds a way.'",Jurassic World

The orchestration by Michael Giacchino was VERY well done as opposed to John Williams, and the actors and actresses fit their roles very well too. Now, I constantly go to Movie's, and in MY opinion, this was one of the best I have seen in the last 5 years, due to the storyline and the incredibly well done CGI. If you love Dinosaurs, you're going to enjoy this movie, regardless of what you think about the rest of the movie. Trust me. If you love action, this one is pretty action packed, so you'll have a great time too.HOWEVER, if you read the rest of the reviews, you'll most likely see title's following the words, ""This Movie Sucked"" or ""I'm gonna go on a rant here"". DO NOT READ THEMLook, everyone has their own opinions, likes and dislikes. My opinion is 10 out of 10 across the board easily. Yours might be different, but before you judge this movie because of all the reviews you've just read, I strongly suggest seeing it first. You're not going to regret it, even if you don't like the entire thing, because this movie is full of likable scenes.My rating is 10 out of 10, and I hope to see people take my advice and see it themselves before they decide what they're going to think about it.",Jurassic World

The story really was well thought out, but the random details ignored and the corny comments and unbelievably stupid behavior by the characters really just ruined it for me.

The trailer summarizes all the bad parts of the movie, which results in the movie actually being a pleasing experience. Unlike most movies, where the trailer displays all the best parts (Ironman 3) and the movie is a total let down, Jurassic World manages, even with a stupidly predictable plot, to create an entertaining movie. It isn't anywhere near as good as the first but it beats all the other Jurassic movies in my opinion. It is surely worth going to the movies for.The acting is credible and Chris Patt excels. The two kids are all right but not at all necessary nor contribute to the plot in any way. Their only purpose seems to be to allow their own relationship, as well as another to develop. The CGI, despite my impression from the trailer, is great and believable. Really the best CGI I have seen in a long time. The 3D is okay. The director makes it work but it could be improved.All in all, given the type of movie it is and after the underestimation caused by the trailer, it is a solid 8/10.",Jurassic World

This made me go into the film as a mainstream film fan, so I could really tell if this was a good film or not, without being bias. I was amazed by how much this film makes you feel like a kid again, it has the exact amount of nostalgia to please the fans of the franchise and enough new material to appeal to a younger audience who maybe haven't seen the first three films.First of all, the cast which this film possess is used to great effect, with the most notable being Chris Pratt, his character Owen Grady is the perfect blend of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, making him likable and very quirky in how he behaves around his Velociraptors and people in general. Bryce Dallas Howard's character breaks the conventions of a female character in a film of this genre, she takes control of situations and you feel that she isn't a girl to run away from danger...apart from running away from the Indominous Rex, which I don't blame anyone for doing so. The supporting characters in the film also help it to come alive and make you think this is a real park with real lives at risk, especially Vincent D'Onfario in his role, he plays it magnificently and you can feel his tension yourself and finally Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the kids in peril aren't as annoying as Kelly in the lost world, so that's an improvement to take note for.When the first trailer for Jurassic World was released, way back at the end of November 2014, people were starting to get very worried about the effects in this film and how they will improve from the first film, the same with the use of animatronics in this film. Well my friends and fellow fans, the CGI in this film are brilliant to look at, even though some scenes you can tell it is from a computer scene, the rest you couldn't tell the difference, they used the animatronics in scenes where they were necessary which has a lot of sentimental value for the film which was a nice touch. Most people thought in this film the Tyrannosaurus would play a minor role like it did in Jurassic Park 3, but the way they utilize the old girl is brilliant, she is amazing to look at and she even has the scars form the fight with the raptors from the first film, you cannot make the T-Rex have a small role in this film, especially when she's the poster girl for this magnificent franchise. It will be hard to make Jurassic World 2 better than this one, but here is to hoping!",Jurassic World
1337,janwillem-carpentier,An average movie at best,5,22 June 2015,"It is hard trying not to sound too negative when talking about Jurassic World. Like the majority of people who will go see this, I very much enjoyed the first Jurassic Park. The movie was ahead of its time and brought the books to life in an interesting way.The sequels Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 were entertaining, but most will agree they did not live up to the name of the original.Jurassic World could only get made because of the time span between the last installment and the present. Unfortunately the movie is a cash grab, riding on the success of the franchise and little else.Story - instead of choosing the angle ""imagine this technology existed"" to boggle the minds of the audience as they did in the original, Jurassic World glosses over this pretty quickly. Statements made in the movie like ""kids are used to seeing dinosaurs"" are bizarre, given that the park has only opened for a few years max. Even if we could clone eg. mammoths in real life (there are some still preserved in ice), humanity would be ""wowed"" for decades to come.The movie chooses the route of a generic predictable action movie: we have our heroes, who we know are immortal in the story, our cliché love interest, our witty one-liners after or during traumatizing events, and one or more villains who - of course - die at the end. The story follows the typical rules so the audience is not disturbed, such as not to kill off any innocent characters that we have a connection with. People that die are either annoying or evil, or are just never introduced to us properly.The main purpose of the plot is to show a range of different dinosaurs in different scenarios, without a real connection between the scenes. The human interaction in the movie is kept to a minimum, and has little importance. This could be OK, but the story as it stands is too disconnected and lacks a sense of direction. Personally it felt like a story that two children or stoned people made up: ""and then they try to shoot the dino with a machine gun from a helicopter"" ""Yeah but let's make them miss their target and crash. How though?"" ""oh i know! the big dino runs into an aviary full of flying dinos!"" ...etceteraTo sum up: the story just isn't believable. The franchise has so much more potential.Presentation - Being a big budget movie, the stress was on special effects. There are some very cool shots and actions scenes, but others fail. The CGI is not as convincing as I had hoped (for example the too bright eyes of the velociraptors, it made them look fake). It is like the dino's had a certain shiny look over them. Even some of the models in the first movie looked better.Also the movie overused the shaky action cam - resulting in several blurry action scenes. And it was obvious this movie was created with 3D in mind, which makes it feel more like a ride in a theme park than an actual movie to re-watch at home on your TV.Sound & Music - I'd say this is the best part of the movie. The roars sounded good and the score added to the atmosphere. Excellent.Conclusion: The movie is perfectly average. You will want to have seen it just once, to be able to say you have seen it, but you will have little desire to ever watch it again. It just has no depth at all.If you are into action flicks- then this will be more up your ally. If you care for well-thought-out stories (like me), you will be disappointed.",Jurassic World
1338,anthonyburkert,Theme park commercial,8,12 June 2015,"Just saw Jurassic World and this is what I think of it. I'll start by saying, Comcast stock will be going up. Comcast, the owner of Universal, is definitely taking its cues from the Disney Company. When Disney feels they need to boost the desire of one of their attractions, they simply make a movie of it. This would explain the Eddie Murphy career decliner, The Haunted Mansion. Pre Muppets reboot, the Muppet attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios, was a virtual wasteland, only bringing in parents dragging their kids to see something from their own childhoods. Pirates of the Caribbean was the most famous and successful of these ride reboots, leading to the revamping of the ride itself to keep up with the success of the film franchise. Now apply this tactic to Universal and Jurassic World, and you have a 90 or so minute movie that makes you want to go to the Jurassic Park section of Universal's Islands of Adventure in Orlando. If you've been there, then much of the first few glimpses of Jurassic World will seem somewhat familiar. Aside from it feeling a bit like a plea to visit Universal Studios, it was actually a hold-on-to-your-butts thrill ride. The story follows much like the very first film. Sibling bonding, too cool older one, smart kid brother. Only the younger smart kid in this one, doesn't come off as nerdy, and is more.. Hmm.. Aspergersy. Sometimes the wealth of knowledge the kid has comes off as cheesy. When half the audience groans at one of the kid's happen-to-know factoids, you know they went too far. There's also the character that's hell bent on using military tactics. There is the John Hammond replacement, who is, basically John Hammond. There are a few times in this movie where they just push a concept too far. For instance, they introduced some 3d cinematography that I've never seen before. The use of reflections as revealing shot, in 3d is the first to come to mind. While seeing the characters, you also see reflection on the glass surrounding them. The effect is the reflection way in the foreground. It's a really neat effect.. Until you tire of seeing it, and then they use it for compelling moment, and you yawn. For this movie to not have been directed by Spielberg, it reeks of his auteurship. The main antagonist in the film is a serial killing GMO dinosaur. In the fashion of Jaws, the ""monster,"" is slowly revealed, careful not to show it in its entirety until a pivotal moment in the movie. I sound like I hated it, but I didn't at all. It was visually stunning to point that the plot didn't matter. Of course Chris Pratt is amazing, though he's basically Starlord meets Caesar Millan. He's the raptor whisperer. There were a lot of throwbacks to the original, while still maintaining itself as its own entity. The female lead, slowly removed her clothing throughout the movie, almost following Laura Dern's loss of layers from the first movie to a T. There were some amazing cameos as well. Look out for Jimmy Fallon making a comical appearance, and old friends from the original showing up here and there. Lastly, what Jurassic franchise movie would be complete without a knock down drag out fight between your favorite dinos from all the series. In the climax of the movie, everything definitely come together, and much like the ending of the first film, we find ourselves cheering for dinosaurs. That was what was great about the first movie. We spent almost 2 hours being scared to death by dinosaurs, only to cheer for them at the end when T-Rex saved the day. This film in its own surprising way, allows for the same. I definitely left the theater cheering for the dinosaurs.",Jurassic World
1339,diaznash,Its like Godzilla but on a lighter note,7,20 June 2015,"After all the anticipation, I couldn't wait to watch this movie. I was a little skeptical of how good it truly is considering Avengers somehow left me a little disappointed/or wanting more. I cant decide between the two. I also had the though the movie will just be another Godzilla movie, which was good but again not like I expected & so today I finally managed to go watch it & ill agree Jurassic World does leave to its hype & it deserves all the glory for beating Avengers in its opening week. The visuals are stunning, it has more humor & isn't as dark as Godzilla. This maybe can be because Jurassic movies tend to target a normal movie goer who doesn't want to think of the complex universe of Marvel or DC with their superheroes. This makes it easy for any one to follow up on the story with a clear mind unlike how we keep creating alternate scenes in our heads when watching something like Avengers (or its just me). In short, You can take your 4 year old kid or even your 99 year old Grandma & they will love it.",Jurassic World
1340,seallymorgan,The good news: It's vast improvement over Jurassic Park 3. The bad news: it's the most predictable entry in the series,6,2 June 2015,"Fine but predictable return to form for the Jurassic Park series finds John Hammond's dream for a ""Jurassic Park"" becoming a reality. However, in a way to have more people come back to the island, scientist's create a hybrid dinosaur as a new attraction. But, like every Jurassic Park film in the series, things don't go off as planed and all hell breaks loose in it's aftermath. Unlike the last 3 movies however, this film is made up of mostly new characters to hold off the Dinosaurs with the exception of a small side character from the Original Jurassic Park film played by BD Wong, who to be quite honest is only there to somehow fulfill continuity from The first film to the new one. It would have made more sense to bring in some of the original leads to bridge the whole series together but that seems to be asking too much. The new characters starting with lead Chris Pratt are fine but underwritten and cliché. Pratt's character and performance is really the only bright spot of the new cast of characters but he lacks the cool sarcastic wit and intelligence of Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm and The everyman appeal of Sam Neill's Dr Alan Grant. Pratt however brings his own warm, comic sensibility that does make him endearing in his own right but unlike Goldblum and Neill who brought dramatic tension to the films, Pratt gets overshadowed by the dinosaurs once the bloody carnage begins. Bryce Dallas Howard is decent but unremarkable in the uptight corporate woman with no life role and Vincent D'Onofrio is OK as the resident head of security of the park. Of course, there are two kids who plays the nephews of Howard's character who are put in the middle of the action one it begins, leading to a predictable climax that while is full of thrills, could have been seen a mile a away.The Dinosaur effects in this film are probably the best in the series so far and while there are moments of Obvious CGI, it really does not distract from how far effects have come over the years from the first film to this one. In terms of dino carnage, this film comes in a little behind The Lost World in that department but not by much. The body count is higher here than in any of the other films in the series but lacks the tension and showmanship that Jurassic Park and The Lost World had in spades. It's however head shoulders above what Jurassic Park 3 had in those departments. Not to mention the fact that while the script for Jurassic World is fairly predictable, it does not overstay it's welcome. Unlike the underwritten Jurassic Park 3 with its very unlikeable characters.Jurassic World is a fine addition to the Jurassic Park series. While its pretty predicable and not as good or as tension filled as the first two films of the series, it's a vast improvement over the disappointing 3rd film. However, if there should be a fifth film, they need to go beyond the new monster of the week and come up with a better script to justify this series continuing for another film.",Jurassic World
1341,lgao-892-416008,Appreciate it for what it is,9,26 July 2015,"Jurassic world differs from all other installments of the jurassic park franchise, it feels more like a family movie compared to a thriller. In this movie, there are more comic relief moments, more content regarding family, and we also know for a fact that none of the major characters won't die. A lot of people say that this movie is predictable, that there is just one big monster and it's powerful, it does a lot of damage and then it gets defeated. But I feel that this generalization of the plot is kinda bs, because every detail of this movie is very enjoyable. You got the cool new dino, you got great chase scenes, you got dino fights, you got a sense of an apocalyptic event, you got good music, and you also got T-rex. I feel like people are judging this movie too much, comparing it to jurassic park and lost world. But we should realize that this is something different, and it is enjoyable, that's all that matters.",Jurassic World
1342,sharpk28,"Great CGI, poor directing.",5,22 June 2015,"I never even post reviews for anything but I figured I had to shed some light on this one. Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't terrible and there were some good parts. Even some great parts. But overall, the director botched this one. The dinosaurs were awesome. Every scene with them in it was phenomenal. However, the movie turned out extremely cheesy. The kids could be taken out of the movie and it would have been ten times better. Me and my girlfriend laughed every time those two came on the screen because there was always something extremely cheesy and lovey to be said. It seemed like the director was just trying to force a story here. The kids did not belong in this movie. They honestly made me want to get up and leave the theater... that being said the rest of the movie was great. The CGI was wonderful and all of the dinosaurs were realistic. In my opinion I think many other directors could have made this movie one hundred times better. So I went in the middle and gave it a 5. It's actually really disappointing to me because this movie could have been one of the best of the decade. It's too bad they had to try to force a feel good, brotherly love story into a movie that involves dinosaurs tearing apart humans.",Jurassic World

1344,OpalOrchid,Best movie I have seen in a while.,8,14 June 2015,"In it's entirety, Jurassic World was a fantastic movie filled with action, suspense, and plenty of laughter. However, the comedic ties back to some comedy of our time and a few cheesy romance scenes could have been left out in my opinion. In the original three movies, there are no ties to the year the movies were produced, besides the technology used, which makes them timeless. This movie, although incredibly fantastic, was lacking in the timeless factor. The other three movies (especially the first one) are my favorite movies and I watch them whenever they're on TV and I own all three. Despite my dislike of the timeless factor, it was a great movie and a definite must-see! Especially the ending, that was INCREDIBLE. You won't be disappointed.",Jurassic World
1345,epjessup,Predicable,3,18 June 2015,"While the JPTwo and JPThree plots were different (good or bad), this seems to be a return to the original Jurassic Park concept. Unfortunately, it lacks the charm and scientific nuances of the original. To me, this was a Sci-Fy Channel original movie with a big budget and better special effects. The characters are stereotyped and one dimensional and the plot is predicable. Plus there are annoying ""are you kidding me"" moments:22 years after JP we find original items like night vision binoculars that still work and a Jeep that restarts with one try with a 22 year old battery; our heroine keeps her high heels on despite slogging through the jungle; our hero's motorcycle rides smoothly over a jungle floor; our hero's assistant is in a hollow log deep in the jungle in one scene and suddenly appears in a facility minutes later.I was very disappointed with this film and was hoping it would end after the first hour.",Jurassic World
1346,congil1,"Great, Mindless Movie",8,21 June 2015,"I personally believe that movies, especially these days, are made for two reasons: To get you to think, or to allow you to ease your mind and entertain you. Some of the most successful movies do both, but having only one element does not mean the movie is poor. Jurassic World is the perfect example of this.With Chris Pratt as the lead, Jurassic World is one of the most entertaining and visually stunning movies that I've seen in theaters in a long time. No, the plot is not overly complicated with twists and turns that leave you thinking. No, character development is not the primary focus for this movie (I actually only enjoyed Chris Pratt and Vincent D'Onofrio's characters, could care less about everyone else). Simply put, what you get is exactly what you think, an entertaining movie about dinosaurs recking havoc, eating people, and destroying stuff. This movie definitely sets the standard for the summer movie season.P.S - The velociraptor scene in the trailer where they are set loose, and Chris Pratt is riding with them, is even more bad ass in the movie.",Jurassic World
1347,Sit_and_Watch,Jurassic World acquires nostalgia to cover its actual rating.,4,28 June 2015,"It's been fourteen years since the last Jurassic Park film and over twenty years since the first one. I say this because I feel as if people are letting nostalgia mask the actual quality of this film. While not being a horrible film it is still a flawed story with sub par acting, cliché dialogue, some shameless product placement, scenes that serve no progression for the story other then stuffing for the time limit and inconsistent quality of the special effects.While those traits listed above make it sound as if this would be no more than an extensive waste of time. This is not the case however as there are a scant amount of scenes that are entertaining enough to hold this film up to standards. The ending being culpable for the most enticing part of the whole film (unfortunately only lasting no more than fifteen minutes).This feature still disappoints me as while first film was more focused on the characters interactions with one another and their thoughts on the park Hammond wanted to show the world (something real that people could touch as explained in his flea circus speech), this sequel mainly focused on the Indominus Rex with its stereotyped characters interrupting the flow of his story.Would this be a film to see in the theaters? If you're a fan of Jurassic park I would recommend that you give it a chance but to also judge it as a standalone piece and not on references to the first Jurassic Park. If you are one who takes films with more judgement than its best too skip and wait for a DVD release or Netflix stream.",Jurassic World
1348,karenirani82,Was a pleasurable blockbuster but the original was classic.,6,13 June 2015,"All in all, I believe it was a good entertaining movie, but predictable. I felt that it didn't offer up anything new that we already didn't know or have already seen. The movie offered a nice homage to the 90's Jurassic Park movie with all the cinematography images reminiscent of the original movie. But I left wanting a little more-maybe more dinosaur scenes? Chris Pratt is always amazing to watch with his subtle comedic one liners (he was amazing in Guardians of the Galaxy). Nice that they didn't make the chemistry between the two main stars of the movie the focus of the movie or too obvious for that matter-it was subtle and just right. Id say that the trailer didn't give away too much of the major edge of your seat scenes and thank god for that because it was nice to be surprised watching those scenes in the movie theater, ie when Bryce's feet shown running in slow motion (what the heck is she running from?). The directors did a good job portraying a ""theme park"" feel to the movie with the busy central hub/communal entrance of the park, the touring attraction with the gyrosphere (neat idea), the marine dinosaur show, the long wait lines typical of attractions, and one predator cage that obviously seemed a comparison to the highlight attraction like that of a lion in a zoo. As always, the raptors are the stars of the show but in that respect too it felt like they were trained pit bulls. I was a little put off at the fact that there was a scene where it seemed like few of them were actually ""growling"" like dogs when provoked. On a minor note, the two young stars of the movie were fine but I think it was slightly overkill portraying the older kid as an hormonal, pubescent, indifferent teenage boy. Again, nothing compares to the kids from the original movie. I usually judge how well I liked a movie based on whether I would return to watch it again. I felt like this was a one time deal. I wasn't awestruck.",Jurassic World
1349,pauldavidmarkov,Should have stayed extinct !,6,11 June 2015,"I really really wanted to like it being a huge fan of the original story and film Jurassic Park but it was missing that Spielberg magic. Some really cool effects but overall disappointing attempt to restart the franchise. Never understand why they can't try something original but have to resort to borrowing from the previous films. Even Spielberg had trouble with his sequels, with the third film in the franchise being particularly bad. Would have liked to have seen some improvements in the actual dinosaurs to reflect current thinking but they decided to stick with the same versions from 17 year ago. I think that this one Jurassic World will end being seen as better than the third film but inferior to one and even two. Direction story and acting were below par with way too many inconsistencies gets a pass from me for at least trying...probably better to save your pennies for the next summer blockbuster or you could always go and watch Max be Mad again.",Jurassic World

1351,tobias-schachinger,"A nice blockbuster, but nothing new.",6,20 June 2015,"As I'd just recently watched Jurassic Park and heard what a huge success Jurassic World was, I thought I'd have to watch it. I went in there expecting a classic modern summer blockbuster with impressive visuals but not too much of a great story. I figured, as Steven Spielberg, the director of the original Jurassic Park, was Executive Producer on this, it couldn't be too bad (I loved Jurassic Park). But then again, Chris Pratt being lead actor made me fear I was going to see a cliché action movie. But enough of my expectations, let's get into it:Story: 22 years after John Hammond wanted to open a dinosaur theme park called Jurassic Park and failed, his dream has now become reality in the form of ""Jurassic World"" - same basic idea, just bigger. But as the audience wants to see more impressive attractions every year, a genetic hybrid has been created - based on the DNA of a T-Rex, but with lots of other elements. The problem is: The hybrid got bigger, stronger and more intelligent than expected.As I'd thought, there is nothing revolutionary in the story. I was afraid it was going to be just Jurassic Park all over again - that's partly true, but there are some new elements in there. In addition to genetic manipulation and capitalism, the movie also tries to criticize military and war through the character of Hoskins, portrayed by Vincent D'Onofrio. I really liked that and it brought in something new, but it could have been done a lot better, it felt like the character was literally just there for setting the movie apart from the original a little bit.Acting: The acting was fine all in all - no outstanding performances, but no failures either. Especially Lowery, the character played by Jake Johnson, makes for a few nice humorous moments. But, as I was afraid, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard make for some terrible cliché moments. That's more of a writing than an acting problem though.Setting, Costumes, Props: Everything looks really good and seems to fit perfectly into the movie. Jurassic World looks exactly like what it's supposed to look like: a huge zoo with fantastic beasts. Only the control room seems a little cliché. And, of course, the lead actress has to get rid of more and more of her clothes and look more and more badass as the story progresses.Visuals and Action Sequences: The CGI looks very realistic, and especially at the beginning of the movie, everything seems very big and impressive. But towards the end, the hybrid looks less gigantic than I expected. On the other hand, it's a good thing that nothing is completely exaggerated. The action sequences are not as terrible as they could be, but a lot of things are pretty predictable and there is no real suspense like in Jurassic Park.Miscellaneous: Especially during the first half an hour or so, there is a lot of really annoying product placement. But it gets better. Or maybe I just didn't notice it any more. In a few nostalgic moments, the movie actually manages to revive the old spirit of the original Jurassic Park.Summary: All in all, Jurassic World is a really good-looking action movie with a few funny moments and nice references to the original, and as a 22-years-later summer blockbuster sequel, it doesn't do much wrong (at least it didn't ruin the franchise for me). But, as in most action blockbusters, there is no real suspense, no really touching emotion, and a lot of clichés.",Jurassic World

One of the worst scripts ever, atrocious direction, overly stupid, cliché-ridden, ridiculous over and under acting, even the dinosaur design was meh (my son, who loves the original, was amazed that the raptors in the movie looked lame even compared to the original, which was made more than TWENTY YEARS AGO). Only actors to save face were Pratt and D'Onofrio. Pratt's part was so underwritten it could have been played by pretty much any actor (at least he seems like a decent person in real life). The part called for being stoic. That's it. Not even any Bruce Willis- type ""Die Hard"" lines. Terrible, terrible dialogue - embarrassingly so. Bryce Dallas Howard's part was so poorly written and clichéd (the writer seemed to be pretty misogynistic in light of how every woman in the movie was portrayed) and she obviously was directed to ham it WAY up. I wouldn't be surprised if this killed her career (I hope not, she's done terrific work in so many other films - but, in this one, she truly was awful). Spielberg should be ashamed at producing or having any involvement with this garbage - as bad if not worse than any piece of trash I have seen from Michael Bay.

1358,jaden_trader,"Enjoyable, but only that",6,12 June 2015,"If you're looking for a fun summer block-buster to go take all your friends to, this movie is definitely for you. ""Jurassic World"" offers plenty of awesome dinosaur fights and chases, good special- effects, and a story that will entertain you in the way that summer action movies do- but that is pretty much all that you are getting here.I believe this movie is the kind of movie you watch when you're home, on the couch, maybe on your laptop or smart-phone, and you have the TV on. The movie tried to make you care and invest in characters that almost seem copy and pasted over from the first installment of the series, except it doesn't really work. I felt very uninterested in pretty much all the characters besides Chris Pratt, because he was the only one that was they took time in developing. One could argue that others were enjoyable, and I would agree if they weren't just killed off or if they took a bit more time developing their interests and motivations.Throughout the film we are exposed to beautiful scenery and landscapes that were very pleasing to the eye.The dinosaurs looked good, but are almost entirely CGI and not enough practical effects. What made the dinosaurs look so realistic in the first and second installments of the series were the life-like animotronics used in the close up scenes, which is absent for most of this film. Don't get me wrong- the dinosaurs still looked great, just not as good as they could have been.Chris Pratt's character was my favorite, and he really ground this movie. Unlike his other role in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", he plays a down to Earth, stoic raptor trainer. He's the guy who cares about the actual people in the park, his raptors, other characters, actually understands the danger of the dinosaurs, and did not wait to act. Though, I don't find it appropriate that the weight of this movie is on Pratt's character's shoulders, when it could have included other meaningful characters like park-workers and tourists that could have made this film live up to it's name. But hey, the dude trains friggin' velociraptors for a living, and you will grow to love this character.There were a lot of times that this movie rides the line of scientific accuracy, like certain dino-fights and executions, but that doesn't take away from the movie at all. In fact, when I saw the many abilities of the hybrid dinosaur in action, that were then explained in awestruck and furious dialogue and monologue, I was at the edge of my seat for the duration of the scene. The only problem I had with the hybrid dinosaur was that it wasn't as built up as it could have been to get that emotional punch or some kind of moment where I cover my face so I don't see the monster of my nightmares prowling around on screen. When it is not on screen, it almost feels as if it isn't in the movie.""Jurassic World"" was an enjoyable movie that I will turn to when it comes on cable, but my experience with this movie did not lead me to believe it was a great work of film.",Jurassic World
1359,DeltaCharliePapa,"An action packed, nostalgic blockbuster with a bit of cheesy dialogue",7,10 June 2015,"If you're a nit picker and an overall negative critic, you will find plenty of things wrong with this movie, you won't recommend it, and you will remain butt hurt until the next installment.However, if you're a dedicated, optimistic and hopeful fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, you're going to enjoy this movie.I have been looking forward to this release from the moment it was announced, and not a day has gone by where I haven't tried to find out everything I can about it. So going into this I felt there was a lot of pressure in terms of my own self preservation, for this movie to be good.And it definitely was.The nostalgia theme throughout this is excellent, they do a fantastic job of tapping into your younger self and making you feel like a kid again. Confidently playing the old JP score without any apologies, and it works!The action is almost non-stop and very well paced, never feeling like there was too much nor too little. The CGI is fantastic, and of course it would've been nice to see more Anamatronics but this is a new age of movie making that we have to adapt to.They do an excellent job of portraying the I-Rex as a creepy, mastermind villain but also as an animal that you overall feel sorry for as it didn't ask to be thrown into the world like it is.The rest of the Dinosaurs have the perfect amount of screen time, and the Raptors are definitely my favourite and I found myself more connected with them than I did with most of the human characters characters.Chris Pratt plays his role fantastically. He was cool, calm, collected but not invincible. And I felt both him and BDH did the best they could with the script they were given. Cheesy dialogue is rampant throughout and very clichéd, however, if you go into this movie being prepared for that I can guarantee it won't be a deal breaker.This movie had an enormous amount of pressure on it. It has dealt with so much criticism over trailers, CGI usage, actor selection, too name a few. Yet it has delivered everything we hoped for as true JP fans and I don't see any of the cheesy dialogue and clichés ruining this movie.I ultimately would've preferred a bit more progression into a darker theme as the story went on, and honestly, although the child actors did a good job, I really didn't care about their back story. It almost seemed tacked on to provide some kind of ad-hoc character development, but was completely redundant.JW is a great movie, not a perfect movie, but delivers on so many levels that only the true harsh critics and general trolls will think its awful.I loved it and I left the cinema feeling very satisfied after months of waiting.A solid 7/10.",Jurassic World
1360,theweirdgerman,On the right track again,8,11 June 2015,"I didn't really expect anything good (after Jurassic Park 3), but I had a lot of fun watching this movie. It is a very fast movie, which makes you disregard the obvious plot deficits. One of the best franchises in movie history might be saved. What I like about this movie: - It never mentions the second and third Jurassic Park installments and it just focuses on the first film. - There are tons of references and easter eggs regarding the 1993 movie. It is impossible to spot everything in one viewing. - The dinosaurs look amazing and the CGI is almost perfect which makes the experience even better. - I even like the idea that Chris Pratt trained the raptors. We are talking about smart animals and humans would try to teach them something. - While we are on the subject of raptors. They were the main predator in the first 3 movies. I really wished for them to turn around hunting humans. Which they did (At least for 2 minutes) - The theme park is very beautifully built and up to date. Every dinosaur fan would want to go there. The first takes (while everything is still in order) are stunning and should be experienced in a cinema. - The dinosaurs have their own mentality. This might be a small thing, but for me it was very important to be able to see the dino's feelings and emotions. What I don't like about this movie: - The plot is quite common and predictable. There are many scenes in which you know what happens next. - There is no real tension generated. Even if you are face-to-face with the predator you don't really feel anything, because everything happens too fast. The dino just appears within seconds or leaves within seconds, which makes it very hard to create tension. Of course, there are many great jump scares, but tension is way more effective than simple scares. - The movie-ending brawl takes many points away from my scoreboard. It is the most predictable scene in the whole movie. Everybody knew that T-Rex and the water dino needed to make another appearance. - Too many shots and camera angles are taken from the first movies. They are not homages anymore if they happen in every second scene. All in all I can say that I enjoyed watching the movie and I hope there will be another sequel some day.",Jurassic World
1361,shannon-hart-63-640137,Improvement over the last!,8,18 June 2015,"(May contain spoilers!) It is what it is. I didn't go in expecting Oscar worthy characters or a complex plot. It is similar to the original Jurassic Park, similar themes and characters, but they've updated it and made it more modern. The genetic dinosaur they've created is intriguing, and I think a much better idea than their original (to make human/dinosaur hybrids). Chris Pratt's character is the only one at the beginning who sees the danger of having dinosaurs, and is one of the few likable characters. He plays the role well and gives the audience a new view on how we treat animals, especially those in zoos. His character shows an actual connection with the dinosaurs and he is the only one throughout who sees the dinosaurs as living beings rather than ""Assets"" who bring in money. Bryce Dallas Howard's character starts off as the ""all business"" type character who is more focused on profits than actually caring for the animals, but turns out to be one of the first characters in the series to learn from her mistakes, and end up definitely kicking ass. I know a lot of people were underwhelmed, but it was what I expected. It shows the audience the dangers of scientific advances without questioning why the advances are important (to quote Ian Malcolm, ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."", shows our treatment of animals in zoos and how we allow corporations to do pretty much what they want with little consequences to their actions. Is it the best Jurassic Park movie ever? No, but it's enjoyable; it's a good mix of humour, action, and some good characters.",Jurassic World

And don't think, ""Oh, it doesn't show anything! Its just off-screen!"" Well, its not. It shows everything. And not 10 minutes after, the Acid Containment Units go after the Indominus, it shows a man in its claws literally being crushed. And you hear the bones cracking. And you hear the screaming.

The acting of the kids were okay but Nick Robinson could have put a bit more if he could but no complains there. Chris Patt was good but not Ty Simpkins acting was pretty darn good! The plot has a twist which the viewers must see themselves and judge but as far as it goes in reality wise, its not that much into how these animals would work in real world. Bryce Dallas acting was not as expected, she did now suit the role, however, Irfan Khan was absolutely amazing in this character as he wanted to portray!Overall the movie did not fair well in all expectations, could have been better but it is OK as far as the element of surprise does.",Jurassic World

I really enjoyed the film, the cast and crew is amazing. The raptors are just magnificent. What you should expect from this movie is an interesting story about the Dinosaurs park and how do the humans manage to abuse from these incredible animals and their profit. It was amazing for me to see this plot in which a lot of corruption is exposed. It was amazing, really, all the kind of dinosaurs were just perfect.

1365,nadiiaevans,"Don't listen to critics, make your own judgment!",10,15 June 2015,"I'm going to start this review by saying that I loved the film. I had read quite a fair share of reviews slating the film for being predictable, no character development and/or no likable characters with bad plot. Now, I get everyone is subjective and a movie one person loves someone else hates; sure the film had its flaws but come on! As a fan of the series I went in full knowing what was going to happen (park is successful, everything is dandy until disaster breaks loose and dinosaurs eat people) And that is exactly what I wanted to see. As for characters I thought each actor/actress portrayed their character well; plus its the dinosaurs I was more interested in not the people. As a summertime blockbuster it certainly delivered, It's not a film made for critical analysis, it's made for uncomplicated enjoyment. Additionally nobody seems to know what they want in movies anymore; movies made simply to take audiences out of reality for some non complicated amusement are bashed for not being smart enough. Not only that but the film was beautifully made, gorgeous cinematography, great CGI and good pacing. Overall it was truly a well made film. But this again is just my opinion, as individuals everyone is entitled to their opinion which is why I say go see it for yourself and make your own judgment. Just don't go around saying it's the worst thing ever or that it shouldn't have been made when it has actually given a lot of other people and enjoyable experience; proving it deserves to exist.",Jurassic World

First thing bad about it is that Chris Pratt has no emotions what so ever. After watching the movie you would think that Chris Pratt's character would be sad at least once. Second thing is that the rest of the cast are not good. You would think that with such a great cast that the acting would be good but its not. Third there is almost no character development at all, its like they don't even care that any of what happened.

1367,ron-alexander-128-307529,Excellent! Very Close to the Original,10,12 June 2015,One of my sons is a huge fan of dinosaurs and JP and has been since he was a baby. He is now 15 and has multiple copies of all the movies and collected almost every JP dinosaur toy that was ever made (plus many other dinosaurs). He has been waiting for this movie since it was originally supposed to come out in 2005. A couple of years ago when it was finally solidified as actual movie it renewed his interest. Since then he has followed every detail available with the making and release of the film. Needless to say we saw the movie last night at the first possible showing. The movie did not disappoint and delivered on being one of the best installments to the franchise since the original. We both felt in a lot of ways it was better than the original! What shocked me today was a lot of reviews posted here. Many complain about a weak story or lack of character development. Seems to me that most of them completely missed the idea behind Jurassic Park/World in the first place. The characters and story in all of these movies are the dinosaurs and not the live actors. Jurassic World was actually the first of the franchise that focused more on the story of the dinosaurs and their character development and not the actors. Make no mistake here folks the star of this movie is Indominus Rex and not Chris Pratt. In fact this movie had many less annoying human characters than the three other movies. Think of the two kids in the original -annoying. I wanted them to be eaten. The next two movies only increased the number of annoying human characters. Jurassic World gave us human characters in the right amount and none of them stole the show from the dinosaurs. My son and I thought it was a great installment to the franchise. Go see Jurassic World you won't be disappointed.,Jurassic World

It had a lot of references to the first movie and that was really funny and it not only brought me joy but the whole audience liked the vibes it brought. Great reboot for the serious although I thought they could have used animatronics more and less cgi. Being a film maker the cgi really distracted me cause it wasen't selling it for me. Great ending, Chris Pratt was a great idea and I always knew that.

1373,fakekmykzy,What to expect when watching this movie from my personal opinion,5,12 September 2015,"When going into this film (on blu-ray or a streaming service if you haven't seen it in IMAX or normal cinema already) you should be expecting:-overall story/plot: 4.5/10 (same old same old... corporations make everything bad and nature punishes humanity for it's impudence)-writing: 2.5/10 (this is not a smart movie so don't expect too much out of this part, if you have some basic logic, you won't be able to relate to the characters, you could argue that their decisions are part of their personality quirks, but giving quirks to every single one of them and making almost all of them make constant life threatening mistakes, throughout the film, that could be avoided with some child-level reasoning makes everything really cringe- worthy and un-relatable)-dinosaurs: 9/10 (it's really nice seeing dinosaurs animated with a high budget and modern technology)-action, suspense: 8.5/10 -drama 3.5/10 (too much cliché drama in a movie that should have little of it)-references to original 6/10 (it's good that they thought of it but... if they made such a big deal out of it then the current events should not be occurring, if not for this dissonance the score would be considerably higher if they only occasionally hinted at the original ,the new generations that did not see the old movie wouldn't care about this and the old generation is inundated with waaaay too many of them)All in all, I'm glad they made this film but at the end, it still left a bitter aftertaste because of the low intelligence characters and decision-making, lowering their capacities just to create the danger and conflict isn't enjoyable at all.

The movie lacks the type of excitement from the previous Jurassic movies which is the authenticity of being in a place with dinosaurs. This is because of the blunt character expression of the kids (main actors) being chased by a humongous dinosaur and also the overall character feel of the actors playing their roles. Chris Patt did well tho portraying his role. Even with the interesting idea of mixing genes, they failed to showcase a lot of that feature. Not much of dinosaur facts exposure, some were just mentioned without visual representation. It would have been more interesting if there were new species discovered and introduced. I lost the realistic feeling when the 2 boys were able to start a car that has been abandoned for 20yrs and a few other scenes. Overall the script could have been improved and better Actor selection for key roles. I like Chris Patt and Bryce Dallas and few others but some were not just cut out to play their own.

Still an amazing movie with great graphics and drama. I watched in 3D and would recommend that. Good movie! Even a little scary at times with some pop out scenes. But I saw it with 10 year old boys and they weren't too scared, so it was still rated G appropriate! I would also love to say that this movie brings back memories. It does not seem to be the same island as previous movies, and things are a bit different. But I would say that is just updating with the times that we have today.

1377,nlaughlin21,Why 'Jurassic World' was a disappointment,5,22 July 2015,"Because I'm and avid supporter of cinema, and attempt making films myself, I'm not quick to judge the work of any filmmaker. To me, anyone who's out there creating, making films and the like for everyone to enjoy and share emotion, has my support behind them. But that doesn't mean I still don't have an opinion about what I watch.I love all kinds of movies/films. I'm not as easy to disappoint, due to having no expectations when I walk into a theater. From that, it gives me an optimistic attitude when I watch films. And ordinarily, I don't review movies/films. I just enjoy them. But in this case, I'd like to share my viewpoint.I was very much looking forward to Jurassic World. The original will always be one of my favorites, and even the Lost World. Jurassic 3 will even hold a special place in my heart, because I was such a fan of the series as a kid. And I really wanted the same for part 4. But I was less than satisfied.What baffles me is not the fact that part 4 pales in comparison to the original, or the cartoon-ish characters of the story, the undeniably un-Jurassic execution, or even the story. But it's the fact that the 4th installment of Jurassic Park is considered one of the best movies of the summer of 2015. It makes me sad to see all of these wonderful films that have come out, just this year alone even, that don't do nearly as well. Child 44, Black Sea, Chappie, Blackhat, Kingsman, Insidious 3, and even Terminator Genisys were among those to do poorly in comparison to Jurassic World. Even Mad Max: Fury Road, aside from overwhelmingly positive reception, barely made a standard profit. Terminator 5 was a much better film in almost every way, and yet was overrun with negative critique. It's just sad to see such wonderful underrated films get thrown under the bus, especially compared to such an overrated monster movie.I don't see Jurassic World as part of the series. It just doesn't mix well at all. With the cheesy one liners, incredibly campy and expendable characters, overused comic relief that spoils almost every dramatic scene, and the execution that doesn't capture any of the emotion that at least both previous sequels could partly achieve, it's a wonder how a movie like Terminator Genisys would end up under pressure, especially after Salvation. I'm not a Terminator Genisys groupie, and it's definitely not my favorite movie that's come out lately, but it's the perfect example of how the critical reception of both Jurassic World and Genisys should have been the other way around.In the end, Jurassic World isn't a bad film. It's enjoyable. But it's a disappointment to the Jurassic series, which has had a rough ride after part 1. Even though they don't compare to part one, The Lost World still had fun characters that behaved like actual human beings, it captured the Jurassic emotion, and it had heart. Part 3 was less than appealing compared to part 2, but it has its moments.Jurassic World is an over-rated, cliché, unoriginal, and cheesy monster flick that might as well star the Expendables. But I will say it is enjoyable, but not as part of the Jurassic series.Rant over!",Jurassic World

1379,ryanmassey-76238,Oh man...that was awful...,1,20 June 2015,"SpoilersSpoilersSpoilers The only good things about this movie were some cool special effects and the underlying message that greed leads to foolish decisions and humans shouldn't tamper too much with nature because nature will win in the end, which are great points, but poorly executed. The way events unfold in this film it insults your intelligence. I can sum it up in 4 sentences-Scientists created the I-Rex , a monster that is a mix of a T-Rex, raptor, clown fish, and a species of frog whose name is escaping me, to increase attendance and profits of the park; -I-Rex gets loose through incredible stupidity of the park officials; -I-Rex terrorizes park, killing everything in its path for fun,except for the raptors when they first meet, and setting the pterodactyls free when he went crashing into the aviary house; -I-Rex dies after raptors, T-Rex, and mesosaurus combine forces.Points -In Jurassic Park everything went to hell in a hand-basket because of one scientist's greed. In Jurassic World everything went to hell in a hand-basket because they're idiots. -As another poster pointed out, why wouldn't Howard's character call from the I-Rex's pen to see where it was? It isn't like it was a one person operation. - The I- Rex is loose...grab the rocket launchers and hand grenadesoh wait they don't have any. They also seem to have no more than two dozen SAR/security guys. -Why wouldn't they take to the air as part of the recovery operation when the I-Rex first got loose? -Pratt's character states the I-Rex will be a monster because it hasn't been socialized. Does that really matter and how can he predict its behavior since it is a new creation and doesn't have full knowledge on its DNA make up? -After the raptors track down the I-Rex I am calling BS on the rocket not blowing the dinosaur up or at least injuring it to a point of immobility and an eventual death from blood loss. I am also calling BS on the raptors and the I-Rex becoming BFFs when they meet. -There are raptors loose in the forest and it is darklet's continue to walk deeper in the woods! -Riding a motorcycle in the junglesure why not! -D'Onofrio's character gets attacked and instead of shooting the raptor, let's run! I realize he is a bad guy, but come on. -They want to portray Pratt's character as the raptor whisper, but at the beginning of the film they attacked him when he went into the change. When they tracked down the I-Rex they turned on him. When the plot needed it they become obedient. I guess third time really is a charm. -When the I-Rex and raptors first met they bonded because they shared the same DNA, which is non-sense of its own. When the T-Rex and I- Rex met, why didn't they bond since the I-Rex mostly has T-Rex DNA? I understand the drive for dominance, but aren't all predators trying to be the apex predator? -The ending is similar to Jurassic Park, but 10 times dumber. I realize it is just a movie, but please make it somewhat believable. A raptor and T-Rex aren't going team up together and the mesosaurus coming out of nowhere is the cherry on top of this non-sense. What prevented the T-Rex from attack the four stooges and or the raptor?",Jurassic World
1380,messee,Same sweet in a shiny new wrapper.,6,13 July 2015,"Visually immaculate and emotionally flawed!!!By no means is this the worst sequel of a loved franchise that I have ever watched, it does however leave me with an underwhelmed sense that we still haven't experienced a worthy tribute to the original masterpiece. Perhaps nostalgia has elevated my expectations and rendered any continuance of the series inferior. Having said this, a praiseworthy translation of a follow-up movie I believe is achievable. To date we have not witnessed characters who inspired as much empathy as the combination of the original cast and I feel that no amount of SGI can fill that void. Despite the above, the SGI is outstanding at every turn and offers some distraction from the aforementioned negatives. I would urge any curious individuals to watch this film purely to be visually astonished. However, if you're a fan of the original then I would advise lowering expectation in regards to being drawn into an emotionally journey.",Jurassic World
1381,angelvancain,Enter Jurassic Park Trilogy + King Kong + Godzilla 98' + Jaws,7,21 June 2015,"Overall the movie is cool. The details(CGI) is unquestionable. When I watch it, it reminds me back when I watch Jurassic Park on VHS everyday after back from school. That time Jurassic Park really beats my hearts with the awesomeness, dinosaurs, thrills, suspense etc. While in Jurassic World, all I've wait is the thrills. But all I got is wait. Because it doesn't thrills much. Good thing is it make Jurassic Park 3 irrelevant. Technically, they can save some money if they combine The Lost World Jurassic Park & Jurassic Park 3 these 2 franchise actually don't have much difference. While in Jurassic World, despite we learn everything in Jurassic Park then somehow they got reopen as Jurassic World which resembles everything is upgraded include the safety, the ride etc. there's still flaw that makes a story. Easier said, if the story introduce new breed(or a hybrid)the movie doesn't works, it doesn't convince the audience enough. Plus the scene is clearly a combinations of Jurassic Park trilogy + Godzilla(1998) + King Kong + Jaws. No originality except, the character. Anyway I give 7/10 for the effort. Besides Trevorrow did a very good job with 'Safety Not Guaranteed'.",Jurassic World
1382,jimbog-77804,Very fun movie,9,16 June 2015,"Too many harsh critics. People look way too deep into fun adventure movies. For those complaining about the acting, this wasn't written in hopes of any of these actors winning an Oscar. Enjoy this movie for what it was. Great action with some very funny comedic lines. It boggles my mind why some people try to find such a deep meaning about this movie. One review stated ""how did these middle class kids afford to go to this place?"" Really? That's what you took from this movie? And for the people complaining about unrealistic action scenes, well no kidding! It's a movie about bringing dinosaurs back from extinction lol it's all unrealistic but it's such a fun movie and it's close up there with the first film. Highly recommended unless you're the uptight kind who can't enjoy a movie for what it is. Two thumbs up!",Jurassic World
1383,wyleray,"CGI Dino fights, occasionally",4,23 June 2015,"The story is set up in about five minutes. You do not care about the actors at all. I don't even remember their names... They are thrust into their first situation so quickly it would make your head spin. That situation is a sad imitation of the car scene in Jurassic Park. It basically fails to entertain much, then there is no action for the majority of the run time of the movie. There are a few scenes where the silhouette of the ridiculous dinosaur kills people, but they are so insignificant you might forget they were there. The plot is such a mess you may also forget it was there. Something about ingen wanting to use raptors in the army...really. The last action scenes is literally a every dinosaur you would care to see fighting one another and then it ends in a way that had me laughing for several minutes. The CGI in the movie also seems to be worse than the first movie, and the actors SUCK. Worth watching if your really enjoy transformers...",Jurassic World
1384,zeliosthomas,And don't get me started on the trash can kick....,3,14 June 2015,"At the start of this movie, we see a baby dinosaur hatching from an egg. The CGI is pretty good, but right after this the movie turns to sh*t. They tried to add story. They tried to add emotional characters. They tried and they tried and they tried and they ended up flat on their face. On second thought... I'm not actually sure how much they tried. This looked like a money-sucking film that lacks story depth and originality. I felt zero emotion towards the characters because of how shallow they were created. Even when something funny happened, it was forced and not funny... at all. Sometimes I would see a bad movie twice, not in this case. Friendly tip, wait until it comes out on Redbox so you only spend one dollar on it... or maybe two.And don't get me started on the trash can kick.... and the fly catch.",Jurassic World
1385,jmasonwn,A bit meh,6,14 June 2015,"My first thoughts were, where are the dinosaurs? There's very little of them in this movie. It's nearly half an hour before we see one and it doesn't get better from there. The storyline is very limp. The character of Claire misfired on a number of levels. The movie didn't make me really care what happened to any of the characters except Owen and Larry and the four raptors. This is the main problem with the film, it doesn't really matter what happens. There's no emotional punch like there was with the first film or with jaws. There's also a distinct lack of tension. This should have been a thrill ride, but it was all very predictable.The best acting in the film was by Blue the 'beta' raptor. The relationship between Blue and Owen was about the only emotional factor in the film. The dinosaurs when on the screen looked good enough, but there was no tension in this film. The score and sound effects were also a bit of a let down for me. It wasn't bad, just a bit meh. I saw it in 3d. There's no need to pay extra. No real 3d effects to speak of.",Jurassic World

Even if you have the free time and you have already watched JP1 10 times, I would recommend to watch JP1 for the 11th time but not this crap.The movie is full of forced logic forced emotions like the story was written based on a formula and all the elements were forced to fulfill the equation which really does not make any sense.I found everyone's acting pathetic, even Irrfan Khan is no good here.Better go for Mad Max Fury Road.",Jurassic World

JurassicWorld is the most Action Packed out of all the Jurassic Movies. The Indominus Rex is ferocious & leads the action. Colin Trevorrow sparing used all the Dinosaurs not making it an Overkill. Best was how things are set up for a Sequel. Super Duper Movie. It's a must watch and IMAX recommended while watching it. Christ Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard have done an amazing lead job for this Movie. The Movie did lack some real life reasoning but still it's amazing. Hoping to see what's ahead in Jurassic World 2. Bollywood's Irfaan Khan did a splendid job playing the Park Owner. All the cast were brilliant. Must Watch as a Summer Popcorn Movie.,Jurassic World
1388,croozer-93678,Kids Movie,2,15 June 2015,I know I'm not enjoying a movie when I just can't wait for it to finish. These are my random observations in no particular order. Annoying soundtrack. Rampant product placement. High powered guns with no recoil. Non believable acting. Continuous acts of random stupidity. Starting a car with a twenty year old battery. A mysteriously changing hairstyle. A self exploding raptor. Man eating flying dinosaurs kept under a glass dome. Training dinosaurs like circus animals and then releasing them. Annoying characters not being eaten. Shooting at a dinosaur with a bazooka after it has moved out of sitting duck position. Plus more that I have thankfully forgotten. If I'd been at the cinema by myself I would have left before the end.,Jurassic World

I was clenching my chair near the end...go with a friend ;) Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard have an entertaining chemistry that is both comedic and touching; more impressive are Chris' ability to withhold a smile and Bryce's ability to run in heels. The only thing keeping me from giving this film 10/10 stars was the background work. While the lead characters maintained a stable amount of intrigue, I was a bit disappointed that the insane amount of extras seemed scarcely utilized. Overall, great film, excellent effects, and if you can't wait for DVD it's worth the money now!",Jurassic World

This movie actually made me a fan of the series. the massive issues with the reviews online is that they expect it to be better than the first, when its not going for that at all. Its being released YEARS from 3, its a complete refresh. I loved the movie it exceeded past my original assumption that it would be mediocre. I'm glad I chose this movie, i hope these reviews online stop comparisons and look at it as a completely fresh sequel to the Jurassic movie series.",Jurassic World
1391,roberttudosa,Jurassic Pork,6,3 October 2015,"We have new effects and the computers are great now so lets make a T-Rex with longer hands. Eventually they solved it, because when you're going to see a T-Rex with that small hands on him you gonna laugh. So, the Nublar Island of Dr. Ham (ond) is rebuild by an Indian owner (Life of Pi) and reopened as an attraction for tourists just like Disneyland. Of course a big bad dino they have created there, is on the loose and is tearing the place down. We don't have Julianne Moore or Sam Neil or that tall fellow who played a fly, instead we have a replica of Julianne Moore and some sort of Indiana Jones meets the dinosaurs. Enjoyable, for family with children. I showed the movie to my 5 years old son (I know I know) and he laughed at it. He liked the effects. I did also. They are pretty good, but apart from that, the movie doesn't bring emotion or something of well played characters. Instead it lingers as they have to kill that scary dinosaur with longer hands than the T-Rex. Chris Pratt seems like he plays for the money and he takes the easy way. (Just keep a strong sword, mate!) Originality is 3, plot is 3, soundtrack is 4 and the effects are about 8 on a 10 scale. But, and there's a big but. The one of the dinosaurs. They know what they are doing. When they released Jurassic Park I was a small boy and watched it many times. I guess they are trying to keep it alive for the younger generation to come. Way to go, Mr Spielberg! (puts 100 mil in pocket) On a positive note, running away with a motorbike in jungle from two veloci-raptors seems legit and also the two kids escaping on foot the mighty scary dino who killed an elite squad previously, is also on the positive side. Go watch it with your kids in Cinema or on a 3D screen. They will love it.",Jurassic World

No competition means big cash. This movie offers nothing new and the few things that are new are very weak. You can tell this was a screen play made on the fly and toward the end whoever wrote is struggling to come up with a way to end it. I only gave it 3 stars for the graphics but really that's nothing special these days. A kid movie. Save your cash and go see Matt Damon movie when it comes out. When they join forces with the raptors I simply dropped my head and knew once again I had been duped.,Jurassic World

I thought the characters in the Movie weren't so interesting except Chris Pratt's Owen. I thought he was the best character in the entire Movie. The Indominus Rex was BADASS. It was scary,intelligent and big. That Moment when it could camouflage was totally Badass!!It just wrecked all those ACU Soldiers apart. And lastly i wanted to talk about the end fight Between the Indominus Rex and T-Rex. That fight was really Amazing and well shot. Go see Jurassic World If you want to be entertained.

1394,nightryder_forever,"Good, not great. Underwhelming, but not bad.",7,4 June 2015,"MINOR SPOILERSAs a film viewer, I can't decide whether Jurassic World is better than the previous two titles in the series or not. It's not even a fair comparison, to be honest. TLW:JP was a straight-up action- horror flick, with shoehorned-in throwbacks to the whimsy and majesty of the first. Joe Johnston delved into B-movie territory, giving us the goofy Jurassic Park:3, and its assortment of musical dung heaps and T-Rex pee collecting teens and That Raptor. Neither picture was essentially bad IMO (there are parts in both I like), but they both failed to capture the spirit of the original. That's what JW tries to do. Hats off for that, but trying alone is not always enough. The problem in the execution is how it handles the 50:50 formula of the first film i.e. 50% world-building, óohs and ahas', and 50% Dino- chomping destruction, 'running and screaming'. JW should have been a larger film that JP. JP dealt with a theme park in the making- here, it has already been made. I'd'V liked to spend more time with the attractions- exploring the amusement park and Hammond museum, seeing more rides. It's not that they don't, they do, it's just not enough. I'd'V liked another 15- 20 minutes for this. After all, we'V waited 14 years for this, haven't we? It's like execs started thinking, 'so it's been 40 minutes since the movie started, why is nobody getting eaten?' My second problem with the film was zero chemistry between BDH and Chris Pratt (though his scenes with the rap-tors and Omar Sy are great). The kids are good in their roles (screaming, being cute), especially the little kid from Iron Man 3. I especially liked them in one scene where they discover a familiar location from the first film. Jake Johnson and Vincent D'Onofrio are the pick of the supporting cast. Coming to the Dino's. The I-Rex is flat out awesome. Won't spoil it for you. But it's worth the wait, and no, all secrets about the I-Rex have not been revealed in the trailers/ spots/ teasers. Kept waiting for scenes with her. The rap-tor squad is pretty cool. I was hoping the rap-tors'd have more personality like Maurice and Rocket and Koba from the Apes reboot, but hey, you can't have everything. Yes, there is a pretty big twist with them too. I think a lot of people have a fair idea about what the T-Rex's role in this film will be, but it's still terrific fun to watch on screen. I really thought we'd get more mosasaurus than we actually do, but whatever. The steradians are decent sidekick villains. The other Dino's are basically filler- triceratops petting zoos and apatosaurus rivers and the like. The CGI ain't bad, except that you know that it is. At every moment. Does that make it bad? I'll leave it up to you. There are several big set pieces that haven't been revealed in the trailer, for which I was grateful. I was thinking with the I-Rex breakout, the I- Rex attack on the security team and the gyro sphere, the preordain rampage, and the velocipede car chase, the film might run out of action scenes, but it doesn't. There are more. The script could have used a little tightening too. Some cringe-worthy lines, but the cast does what it can with them. That's about it, really. I enjoyed the film, but was it worth the wait. No. Maybe the sequel (which is set up well) will be.",Jurassic World
1395,MrBrightsky,Colin Trevorrow successfully revived the franchise.,8,9 June 2015,"The moment we've been waiting for is finally here: after a long absence, the dinosaurs of the successful Jurassic Park franchise make their triumphant return to the silver screen. Many years after the eccentric John Hammond's attempt to open a prehistoric zoo, Jurassic World is finally open to the public. Thousands of tourists visit the park I could only dream of as a child on a daily basis. The park is open. But how firmly is man actually in control?Whether you call it flogging a dead dinosaur or sticking to your guns, the fact remains that the main plot of Jurassic World is hardly innovative. Sure, the park is open and the number of potential casualties is a lot higher, but the essence remains the same: man is too proud and gets punished for it. After they finally managed to be in control of an entire theme park filled with prehistoric animals, investors and visitors want more: a spectacular dinosaur, bigger, louder, with more teeth. Hubris at its finest.But that which gives Jurassic World just that little bit of added depth is the subplot featuring Owen Grady's (Chris Pratt) raptor pack. After extensive training, he has succeeded in establishing a bond of mutual respect with the lethal raptors and managed to become the pack's alpha male. Trained dinosaurs offer perspectives, at least as far as Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), head of park security, is concerned. Weaponizing dinosaurs is an idea that has been circulating for years as a main plot point for an eventual fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise, and it's nice to see how director Colin Trevorrow manages to insert this into his movie without resorting to the ridiculous ideas of dinosaurs carrying firearms or half man, half dinosaur hybrids that used to circulate on the internet.The characters of Jurassic World are enjoyable, though not without flaws. Chris Pratt plays the tough but witty Owen Grady, who hunts the Indominus Rex with his raptor pack. He is an ideal protagonist, but sometimes you get the feeling this movie is just too much of a ""Great Chris Pratt Show"". We've got to hand it to him though, there's certainly a large amount of chemistry between him and Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Claire Dearing. Personally, we could have done without the budding romance between the two of them, but oh well: Hollywood will be Hollywood.Jurassic World wouldn't be a true Jurassic-movie without children in distress. Kids of the day are Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins). They are somewhat more intelligent than the average Jurassic brats, but except for a moment or two that hits you straight in the feels, it's probably better to look at them as plot objects instead of genuine characters. We know your parents are getting a divorce, but don't let that be a surrogate for having an actual personality. And as always, they have plot armor. Infinitely more interesting is the owner of the park Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who is every bit as crazy as John Hammond ever was. At least the man has some heart: he seems to genuinely care about the well-being of the animals that most consider to be nothing more than company assets and he isn't scared to hop into his helicopter to assist in hunting the Indominus Rex himself.But enough about the meat bags, let's talk about the real stars of the movie: the dinosaurs. Just a week ago, I was gushing over the animatronic dinosaurs of Steven Spielberg, but when it comes to dinosaur design, Jurassic World knocks the ball right out of the park. They may not look a whole lot different from their predecessors, but it's when they start moving that you're really taken aback. The fight between the Ankylosaurus and the Indominus Rex is dynamic, and the Triceratopses rushing ahead like angry bulls finally banish the image of sluggish giants from our minds. But the real highlights are the raptors: the movements of a hunting raptor are nothing short of art, true poetry in motion.This review would be sorely lacking if I didn't mention the general atmosphere and suspense in the movie. With the ""Oh F*ck"" moments in this movie, Trevorrow manages to reach the same levels of suspense as the original novel by Michael Crichton and the first Jurassic Park movie. Our jaws literally dropped when the Indominus Rex displayed the ability to change its color to blend in with its surroundings like a chameleon and a shiver ran down our spines when that very same Indominus, part raptor herself, started to communicate with Owens raptors. The violence of Jurassic World is sometimes rather visceral. After watching all three of the original movies again in one glorious binge, I figured I wouldn't even flinch anymore at lawyers being eaten alive or limbs being torn off, but the final struggle of Zara Young (Katie McGrath), who gets swept off her feet by a Pteranodon, dropped in the Mosasaur tank, picked up again by the Pteranodon screeching and struggling, only to be devoured by the Mosasaurus, is particularly brutal.

The movie does have great CGI and really amazing action sequences. Great atmosphere at times especially before the carnage unleashed by the I-Rex.But it lacked a good plot, almost little to no character development; has a very predictable story-line, and the dialogues too fell flat at times.***Spoiler*** Personally, what had disappointed me most was: 1. the changing of allegiances at the flip of a switch by the raptors. They change sides 4 times in a 24 hr time-span! (anti-human, pro human hunting the I-Rex, with the I-Rex n anti human, with Pratt n anti I-Rex). Really?! Even politicians don't flip-flop so much so quickly! 2. The ending, it could have been much more intelligent rather than having a tag-team or a handicap match between dinosaurs who just 'bid goodbye' after beating their foe. Seriously!! The T-Rex and ""Blue"" the raptor nod in acknowledgement and part ways after beating the I-Rex (special thanks to the Mosasaur). Surely they could have come up with something better! Even the exchange between Pratt n ""Blue"" at the end, what was that about?!. To me the ending felt like a Spaghetti Western- esque parting of ways by the remaining anti-heroes after a Mexican Standoff, but in this case you had two dinos and a human. The whole thing is so Absurd !!!! *********More of a 'rinse-repeat' of the first one, just with a different setting, a different antagonist (the I-Rex) and some really good action sequences.

It was epic & makes me miss the old times. Its definitely a 5 star movie quality.

1402,joshuacaldwell,Dreadful. Stupid. Sycofantic in its own way.,5,19 July 2015,"Approximately two years ago, film websites interviewed Spielberg and Trevorrow alike. Both assured that this film would take the franchise back to its roots- thus introducing all of the wonder and enthusiasm that surrounded the first two entries of the series. After seeing this movie, I must say that no film has ever left me so confused and utterly disappointed. The premise is unfathomably stupid. The cruel, simple truth is that Jurassic World aspires to be far greater than its writers intended. By that, I mean that any film that is added to a legacy of notorious blockbusters should continue in their footsteps. Many other reviewers of this picture have made claims as to why the first two films in the series were so successful, but for the sake of argument, can we not agree that practical effects, realistic dialogue, and a certain tone of seriousness significantly contributed to the success of those films? None of the components listed above are to be found in Jurassic World. If anything, the film lays out a rigid set of moral rules that approach issues such as genetic modification, corporate greed, and social injustices, yet, does not seem to adhere to them in any fashion. The film flows as if it is ignorant of its own contradictions, with the sole purpose to ""entertain"". And entertain it does in some form, but once again, the first two entries did more than that- they confronted us in our seats with moral dilemmas that not only advanced character development, but questioned the moral fiber of the scientific and corporate communities at large. Although a disappointment to the die-hard Jurassic fan, the film isn't a complete failure. Certain scenes were shot beautifully with a high amount of tension present, but this was never the result of anything more than fancy camera angles and expensive equipment brought forth by a studio that is in pursuit of the ""almighty dollar"". There's nothing special here. Don't get excited. You will be sorely disappointed.",Jurassic World

I've watched the Jurassic Park movies at least a hundred times and the first one has always been my favorite - but this one blows it out of the water. The CGI is excellent. It's got a good storyline.

This movie already has such an added pressure of living up to those classics, that its almost an impossible task to do so from the get go. The last time i watched the old Jurassic's where when they were released so you definitely don't have to remember or have watched those before seeing this movie.

At the beginning, when the family started their children, and the boy was also very excited, I thought it would be awesome. The dinosaurs, the haunting and the ride to the life were very cool too. But right on the moment of the middle of the film, I knew that it would disappoint me. The story outline is to unclear, cause there are too much dinosaurs to fight and they don't know what really should do. Secondly, kissing in this film is inappropriate for the movie which mostly children watch it. Furthermore, actor and actress doing that scene did not persuade viewers enough. It was such an awkward kissing scene. Last but not least, the end. Ugh! Really? Can you guys leave anything left for the watchers to enjoy? No. I felt so empty.

It's never actually explained how their American middle-class parents actually afford two first class plane tickets to Costa Rica just so their kids can see their aunt. It's just assumed it's on the absentee aunt's bill. Gray is your typical kid, bouncing like a madman from one ridiculous event to the next. JW is a gigantic theme park consuming most of Isla Nublar, where JP was created. This multi-billion dollar facility boasts interactive holograms of each dinosaur species in the park, a research laboratory that made this aspiring zoologist weak at the knees, and a thriving population of both herbivores and carnivores. There is a petting zoo where kids can ride baby trikes and apatasauri, a SeaWorld-like arena where a Mosasaur is spoon-fed great white sharks, and giant hamster balls where visitors can wheel themselves through a gigantic field of herbivores. Zack gleefully informs us that JW has over a dozen herbivore species and roughly 10 carnivore species. Unfortunately, we never get to see most of these species during the pair's jog through the park. We witness at most 5 herbivores (Triceratops, Apatasaurus, Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus, and Anklyosaurus are the ones I can recall) and 5 carnivore species including the Indominus Rex (Pteranodons, Dimorphodons, I.D., Tyrannosaurus, and Velociraptor). It is never explained HOW InGen, the infamous soulless corporation that refuses to learn from its mistakes, got running again after the incident in San Francisco. It's stated that the original JP event happened twenty years ago, which meant that Jurassic World must have started construction only a year or two after JP: III. It is not mentioned how they got control of the island (we saw how well a dying company's last ditch effort worked in The Lost World), or how they even got funding. Their shareholders, realistically, dumped them like so much cow dung after JPand if they hadn't then, they would have after The Lost World. The company should have been going through a terrific melt-down of assets during JP: III, and be nonexistent by Jurassic World. Even with the Marani corporation bailing them out, the public should have avoided any new dinosaur theme park like the plague. So we're left in wonderment as to how this highly advanced, popular theme park Jurassic World was even constructed. In roughly 16 years, the public has completely forgotten the dangerous islands and now treats the viewing of a Stegosaurus akin to seeing an elephant in a zoo. Given the public's long memory of even a single animal incident such as Steve Irwin's death, this is extremely difficult to believe and we are given no explanation as to how this came about. It simply is. Enter a wooden Chris Pratt, an ex-Marine who inexplicably has a rather advanced view on animal behavior. He treats 4 raptors, named Delta, Charlie, Echo, and Blue, like large dogs. He tells them to ""stop it"", and wags his finger at their snapping and snarling like we would at a disobedient horse. These raptors are quite possibly the worst design in JP history. The CGI looks cartoonish instead of terrifying, and the raptors don't move or act the same way we've become accustomed to. They don't bob their heads like birds, they don't raise their tails high up in the air due to bird hips, they're more muscular rather than slender and fast with beefy heads and necks, and they parrot sound effects that are obviously cannibalized from the other films. While this last is true of the other Jurassic Park films, it stuck out like a sore thumb in Jurassic World. Noises we've come to associate with attacks, such as the ""scream"", are thrown in casually as background noise. The overall effect cheapened animals that have been the cornerstone to Jurassic Park, and made me utterly unafraid of them. Of course an ""incident"" is thrown in with a feeding employee yanked into the cage after Chris Pratt's character finishes training them, but it feels wooden and over-the-top. Cheap jokes are thrown in at the hapless new employee's expense after our hero saves him from his 4 pet raptors. Enter easily the most boring human villain on the planet, a fat InGen employee named Hoskins who is the typical Guns, God, and America patriot. He wants to train the raptors to attack America's enemies and sell them to the US Armynevermind that said army was called in at least 2 of the 3 JP films to extract desperate survivors of Isla Nublar and might have a long memory concerning half-mad jungle occupants. Chris Pratt is against this, and emphasizes that the raptors are wild animals and cannot be trusted as suchbefore he affectionately pets a snarling raptor with its head encased in a metal restraining device. It would have been a lovely time to use the gorgeous animatronics JP is known forbut instead we get Pratt awkwardly rubbing his hands over a wiggy CGI insert. In fact, there is only one obvious animatronic dinosaur in this film.a dying Apatosaurus gently petted and sobbed over as it dies of wound inflicted by the escaped Indominus Rex (which looks like a crocodile mated with a baryonyx and was the epitome of disappointing). The hapless Apatosaurus ends up looking like a pool toy, with none of the exquisite detail previously handled by the gods of animatronicsthe Jim Henson company. This movie was worse than the infamously-bad Jurassic Park 3. It was worse than Gigli. Save your money.",Jurassic World
1407,themanfromoz,Not the worst but ...,4,12 June 2015,This is a typical 'turn your brain off at the door' movie.Yes it pays homage to the originals but from there it is downwards.Humans create a monster.Monster escapes Humans try to kill monster.Humans use 'trained' Velociraptors to track monster.Velociraptors turn on humans to help monster.Velociraptors helps humans to kill monster.T-Rex helps humans to kill monster.T-Rex helps humans then simply walks away.Velociraptor simply runs away.Seriously????,Jurassic World
1408,zombiepilot,OK But not Great,5,12 June 2015,"I went to see this reboot of the series with high expectations. I also went in under the mistaken belief that this was directed by Steven Spielberg himself. He hasn't directed a film since Lincoln. Well it definitely shows. So many things to not like about this film. One.. Not scary. at all. It felt so contrived and safe. Like a Disney ride you know will come to a end after some brief manufactured jump outs. Two. Bryce Dallas Howard seems miscast. Almost robotic. Third. Not enough dinosaurs. The""asset"" as the one ""scary"" dinosaur they review to in this movie. Is a Godzilla wannabe. I can see why the screenplay needed 4 writers. Its a mashed up mess. Next time wait for it on DVD!",Jurassic World

Acting was decent... wasn't expecting anything since it was Jurassic movie... but somehow no one looked scared in the movie.. ... the graphics were amazing and that was the only reason i gave it a 4 stars..just not happy... disappointed with the movie...and i had such high expectations... why so many killings had to be shown? there were kids at the movie theater.. god!!,Jurassic World
1410,raydisher,A mistake 65 million years in the making,1,12 June 2015,"*Spoliers* Jurassic World insults your intelligence and treats you like child. Remember the pile of dinosaur dung from part 3? Well, it makes it's reappearance as jurassic world's plot. I'll just list some questions I had as I was watching the film. (1)They said the I Rex was 50+ft tall and then they said the wall around it was 40ft tall, so when they thought it escaped shouldn't they have seen 10ft of dinosaur? (2)Why did Claire drive down a dirt road and THEN call control? Why didn't she just call control when they thought the I Rex escaped? (3)There were people working on the wall, why didn't Claire & Owen ask them if they had seen a giant dinosaur climb the wall they were working on? (4)Nobody looked for dinosaur footprints and broken trees before jumping to conclusions? (5) How did they think the I Rex escaped? It had little arms, it couldn't have climbed the wall.(6)Why was that pig so important? We just saw a goat be sacrificed. (7)Why did the ""dino hunters"" have kevlar vests on? (8)when the Air Force gets in the helicopter, why is the CEO guy flying it? They didn't send an Air Force pilot?(9) Where did they put the tracker in the I Rex? How exactly did it reach to bite it out? (10) Why weren't the gyroscopes on tracks? Where and how does that ride end? (11) Why did they use cattle prods and not the super-tranquilizers from the previous films? (12) Who were the people with Owen as he was shooting the flyers down? And why were the guns so quiet?(13) Did the ""Zarr"" lady really deserve that long death sequence? I mean the actual villain gets killed off-screen.(14) Why were they hugging in the middle of a flying dinosaur frenzy? (15)Whose side were the raptors on again? (16)Who taught that raptor how to nod in agreement? (16)How did 2 teens fix a 22 year old dead car? (17)When the T-rex was let out, why did Claire stand in front of the door? How did she run that fast in heels? She couldn't of used that other guy's 4-wheeler? (18)Why did they need to see what the raptors were seeing? Why did the raptors need radar? (19) What happened with the divorce thing? (20) So the T-rex is released, the heroine of Jurassic Park, the most iconic character in the series. Surely she will kill the big mean I-Rex right? Nope. Giant alligator eats it. And how exactly did the Mesosaurs know what was happening on the surface? How did it know to jump out of the water at that moment? (21)Was it just me or was this movie geared toward children? Kinda strange for a movie about a creature that kills for sport. Finally, why did they murder what could have been? They had 22 years to come up with a decent plot and script. Did anybody watch this movie before they released it? Boooooooooooo.",Jurassic World
1411,fylstratr,Best yet,10,12 June 2015,"Although it cannot recreate or top the sense of wonder and awe created by the first movie, this was by far the best of all four. The last two were pale attempts to capture the excitement of the original. This one went beyond! Of course it is 22 or more years later than the original and the special effects only get better. The scale of the story also was expanded from one small ""Park"" to A ""World"" sort of like comparing a county carnival to a Disney site. I know I will watch this movie many times again and possibly buy the DVD or Blu-ray when released. I rarely do that; I thought it was that good. Will be recommending it to all my friends. My guess: the highest grossing film of 2015.",Jurassic World
1412,lukecypert,The premise of Jurassic World is that audiences are stupid,7,12 June 2015,"I feel like the entire premise of Jurassic World was to say that audiences are stupid. Of course most audiences aren't literate enough to get that they are being dissed. That said, I enjoyed the movie lots a lots *smile emoticon*#JurassicWorld was loads of fun. I enjoyed basically every moment. As long as you can ignore the fact that animals don't really behave like that and that you know the ending and who will die from the moment you see each character (as the entire movie follows the well established formula of monster movies) then you should have a grand time! And I did! Probably since I expected a pretty straightforward action/thriller I was in the right mindset to accept a pretty straightforward action/thriller.Spoilers below:In the film, the reason the business people created the mega-ultra-super dinosaur was because audiences wouldn't come unless the dinosaurs were bigger and badder. Then the movie proceeds to tromp that bigger badder dinosaur around releasing mayhem on the island until the bigger badder battles the little bads, then the little bads team up with another big bad until the biggest baddest eats the bigger badder.The movie says directly, ""audiences aren't wowed by dinosaurs,"" we need a 3-way CG dino battle ended by an even bigger CG dino to make audiences happy. So when the movie audience hears that the on screen audiences aren't wowed by regular dinosaurs, we shake our heads and think ""those dumb people need to appreciate what they have and not always want things over the top!"" Then the movie says ""YOU WANT THINGS OVER THE TOP."" And when the real audience is given over the top, we nod along and say, ""yeah, that's what I wanted!"" But we're not smart enough to draw the connections and see what we're being dissedBut who knows, maybe that was unintentional?Either way, the movie is a great time. I loved the characters, I loved the way the story was told. I think everything was top shelf. Congrats to everyone who worked on the film!If you like Jurassic Park movies, then you'll love this sequel.",Jurassic World
1413,nicko_is_master,childhood reborn,9,12 June 2015,"This film after getting a lot of flack is still a very good film. Infraction if you watched Jurassic park as a child then this film just capped the franchise. True it is no Jurassic park but that's the thing. Its not, its Jurassic world. It adds everything you ever wanted to see as a child. Raptors being bad ass. A full functioning park. Which the original never did. True a massive hybrid dinosaur was a bit strange but it works. Especially when is starts causing trouble. Chris Pratt plays his character very well. Plus everyone else did also. Dr Wu makes an appearance but is now evil. Always knew it! But the film to someone who loves Jurassic park. Will love it. If your going to see it wanting another Jurassic park. It isn't because its Jurassic world. A completely different film. Jp lovers enjoy.",Jurassic World
1414,cftsker,best film in the series imo,10,12 June 2015,"this film is by far the most entertaining in the franchise in my opinion. Don't let the low ratings by some viewers fool you, this film is not as predictable as they say. To even say that the second film in the franchise is better than this is redundant as well. the CGI in this film is better and always will be more superior than the ones in the other movies. people expect this film to have a build up like the first film did but the first film already established what the dinosaurs were and what they had looked like. this film is not comparable to Jurassic Park 3 in any way as Jurassic park 3 had lazy writing in it. I will admit that the film had some subplots that led nowhere that were unnecessary. this film brought nostalgia to me and many others in the theater as we sat in for the first viewing of the evening. Colin trevorrow and cast did an amazing job. anyone rating this film low is not a true Jurassic Park fan as much they say they are. Jurassic Park had its major flaws as well. it's a fact that Tyrannosaurus Rex and Stegosaurus were misspelled in the first film when nedry stole the embryos. if a few holes in the plot are enough to ruin the movie, that would ruin a film for me as well. this was better than the original Jurassic Park to me but to actually compare them would be a mistake. this film had its very own feeling but it did make me feel like a child again. I also refuse to acknowledge anyone's existence if they even say the CGI was bad or that the dinosaurs have a lack of feathers. this is Jurassic Park, a fictional novel turned film that uses improbable science to splice dino DNA with frog DNA. If that already doesn't throw out the book of paleontology for you, then i know nothing that will",Jurassic World
1415,kennethpgatewood,Rose Colored Glasses,7,12 June 2015,"I just saw this movie, and upon reading these reviews I'm seeing a lot of people downplaying this movie for hypocritical reasons.First of all: let's get it out of the way that it was an enjoyable movie.I'm seeing people complaining about how repetitive and predictable the plot was, while JP1/2 were superior. Are we suffering from nostalgia here? I think you're remembering these movies in a better light than they actually were. Let's keep in mind that the Jurassic Park franchise was brand spanking new with unbelievable special effects two decades ago; lifelike special effects don't wow like they used to- they're commonplace. Moreover, in the first trilogy the forward motion of the plots/events was almost entirely predicated at every point by someone doing the most moronic thing you could think of for the given situation. That is where the suspense and drama came from in the earlier movies... COMPLETELY by the characters being morons who got themselves in to danger, where otherwise any even modestly intelligent human would not, and narrowly escaping.Jurassic World manages to move the plot without making the audience yell at the characters' for their incomprehensible stupidity. It also continues most of the themes from the previous movies. As well as being an amalgam of story arcs from all the previous movies, without losing the entertainment.",Jurassic World
1416,hdiob,Dinosaurs... are back,9,12 June 2015,"Growing up I watched Jurassic park, lost world and 3. My favorite franchise as a kid. This movie gave me more of what I love, people coming together while running from dinosaurs. It had some spectacular moments visually (I saw it in 3d). That's what i liked, but I don't think it lived up to the prequels, and it didn't really have that sense of being lost in the woods.There is something new in this one, the dinosaurs have intelligence because of being genetically modified to create new breeds. It didn't make much sense to me. And if you saw the movie already, then I have one thing to say, You're not going off to war",Jurassic World
1417,adrian-96928,What a Letdown,3,12 June 2015,"Alright being a fan of the Jurassic Park movies, I was hyped to see this movie more than anything else this summer. Boy was I disappointed!The Good: Chris Pratt is charming as always, CGI dinosaurs are great looking, great cast (aside from Bryce Howard), some funny moments throughoutThe Bad: SO MANY DAMN PRODUCT PLACEMENTS. Holy crap they needed to take it easy with the Mercedes and Samsung logos in every scene. The beats and coca cola placements were so awkwardly placed that it took me out of the movie. Generic plot with no real surprises and zero character development. I don't know why I expected any of this but it felt like such a generic Hollywood movie with no twists and a predictable ending (not going to spoil anything). Laughable dialogue and obvious bad guys from the start.Save yourself the money and rewatch the original. This just felt like a lazy cash grab",Jurassic World
1418,brandong-83564,"Great time with the kids...Family fun (with Dinosaurs ;), all the way!",8,12 June 2015,"***************************SPOILER ALERT*************************The kids dragged me out to see the movie for Fathers day, was not up to it as if I was feeling winded from last nights fiasco. It opened very abruptly and the story felt rushed, as it was more about selling movie tickets rather than really paying respect to the franchise. Its not really as predictable as most reviewers are saying it is though. I would argue it was more paying homage to the original and is what made it so entertaining in the first place. The kids loved the jump scares, I really loved the amount of dinosaur screen time. The Animation Graphics were GREAT. My sister loved the Gallimimus herd running through the field by the ""hamster ball"" haha! It was nice. She also liked how the weather was portrayed throughout the film as they did not really use rain as does most of Hollywood for a cheap thrill. I do agree that there was an excessive amount of spotlight on the newly introduced Indominus Rex which left little room for character development in the T. rex. Though we did see a lot of growth when the producers decided to experiment with the intelligence of the velociraptors by making them trainable. I was moderately let down when there wasn't some type of scene, you know, where the mosasaurus attacks a boat full of fleeing park attendees and the movie kids barely escape by riding on the back of a loose dolphin that was supposed to be a meal but it turned out not to be because the mosasaurus was distracted by the fleeing boat and the people on it. Soundtrack was engaging and brought bucketloads of nostalgia.",Jurassic World
1419,atryanhart,Jurassic Wold - Viewer's Perspective,10,12 June 2015,"Jurassic World is by far one of the best movies I have seen since 1993...when Jurassic Park was released! Yes, that's right...1993 Jurassic Park! This movie holds true to the movie's legacy, the original movie's legacy (not those other failed attempts at continuing Jurassic...). It has been a long time since I have sat in a theater and listened to the audience shriek, yell, boast opinions (yelling out like they were watching the show from their home TV), cheer, and finally clap at the end of the movie! The movie was well composed, with a strong plot containing a spectacular balance between predictability and complete blind-siding moments. I doubt anyone will say that this movie was poorly directed. The movie has a gripping ability to elicit emotions from the viewers, drawing strong bonding moments that will have you expressing your emotions either to yourself or out loud (as most did during the movie). Casting for the movie was well selected; with familiar faces most everyone who watches standard TV shows or other great movies would recognize. And, must I include the original himself...BD Wong! Yes, that's the same actor from the original movie (some may know him from Special Victims Law and Order). What a contribution to the original movie than to have members from the original casting appear nearly 20 years later to pick up where they left off! The last show I can recall doing that was the movie Tron staring Jeff Bridges. That just add a certain heart felt compassion for the movie to us who were lucky enough to view the original Jurassic Park upon it's release. Take notes directors, this is how a movie should be directed; with the audience in mind and promising to take them on a ride during your entire film. If I had more than two thumbs, I'd certainly hold more up. This is a must go see movie. Hell, I may go see it again. And don't cheat yourself, view the 3D version!Thanks for reading mates!",Jurassic World

I'm no movie critic, just an ordinary movie buff who've sat through a number of low- budget films, but the acting was not one bit convincing for me compared to those! Heck, the raptors acted way better than the humans in the film! That pretty much ruined everything. The main actress trekked through an entire forest wearing HEELS?! Also, her hair went from STICK STRAIGHT TO PERMED towards the end of the movie! We can tell between permed and messy hair, thank you very much. Like seriously, WTF?!?! You can't make a convincing blockbuster film without getting down and dirty, and this movie focused on making the actors and actresses look good. I'd give 2 points for the dinosaurs though, but that's it. Don't waste your time and money guys, trust me, you're not missing anything if you skipped this.",Jurassic World
1422,krtrenkamp,"May not be perfect, but it's still amazing!",9,13 June 2015,"Jurassic World is about a newer version of Jurassic Park. Jurassic World has been opened for ten years and desperate to see the park numbers spike again, the park has created a new dinosaur: the Indominus Rex. The movie follows several human characters: Owen, who has been hired to train velociraptors; Claire, the vice president in charge of the business side of things; Grey, an autistic child who is extremely excited to see the dinosaurs; and Zach, Grey's older brother who seems to not really care much about Grey or the Dinosaurs.Now I've heard a lot of the term 'one-dimensional' tossed around a lot in the reviews I've read. However, I'm assuming they either didn't pick up on it or they don't know what the term means. A one-dimensional character is a character who lacks depth and doesn't grow or learn throughout a story. While I will agree there wasn't a lot of depth to them, several did grow as characters.I believe the character who lacks the most depth and doesn't learn out of our protagonists is Owen. He doesn't seem to learn anything new or grow as a character at the end. That being said, I still liked the character. He seemed to be the only reasonable adult character at the beginning of the movie.At the beginning of the movie Claire sees the dinosaurs as assets and the park's guests as numbers. However you see that start to change when we see the Apatosaurus's have been attacked and are dying. She is finally understanding that the park's dinosaurs are more than an attraction and can suffer.Grey does have plenty of depth however. He is shown to be autistic without directly pointing it out. He is incredibly smart when it comes to numbers and information and is very interested in the Dinosaurs. Zach starts out as a stereotypical teenage boy with little interest in anything except for girls. He even dismisses his brother quite a lot at the beginning of the movie. However, he does show his brother sympathy when his brother becomes upset about their parents divorcing. Then later, he becomes closer to his brother as they do their best to survive and get to safety after their gyrosphere misadventure.As for the villains, yes, they were pretty one-dimensional. But a lot of villains are written that way. That doesn't make up for that fact that Hoskins was just a badly written character with a one-track mind. He didn't even show concern when the raptors turned on his men. He still thought it was a good idea to use these wild dinosaurs as weapons. Now, onto the dinosaurs.I'll start with the raptors since we seem to see them on screen the most. Now, if they hadn't explained how they were trained then I'd call it completely unrealistic. I would use the term 'trained' for them loosely, which is the same way I'd use it for a tiger at a circus. Were they attempting to train them? Yes, however wild animals are unpredictable and can't be completely tamed.As for the nod that I've seen mentioned constantly I will agree; yes, it does seem silly. But at the same time the raptors are shown throughout the movie to be intelligent. So perhaps it is just the raptor mimicking what it has seen people do. That said, I think it would have been best to leave it out.The Indominus Rex was a unique creature for sure. She did have a bit of a sad background with how she was raised in isolation. There was one thing that kind of bugged me though (not much though). Apparently she ate her sibling but not the raptors. Why would she communicate with them but not her sibling? Well, my best guess is that she saw her sibling as a challenge for dominance while the raptors were much smaller and didn't pose as much of a threat to her. I wish it had been addressed in the movie however.Now for my favorite dinosaur in the movie. The mighty T-rex. I loved that they seemed to consider the events in the first movie for her appearance in this one. Twenty-two years after the first movie and it has shown just how old she has gotten. She's not in her prime anymore and they did a good job at showing her age. Not only did they show that time has in fact passed for her, but she also has the scars from her encounter with the raptors in the first movie. She might not be as powerful as she once was but she can still kick ass.There was so much detail in this movie that pointed back to the first one that it blew me away. They didn't just mention it. They showed it. Including the age and scars on the mighty T-rex, we saw the old welcome center, the mural with the raptors on it where the kids from the first movie saw the shadows of the raptors, the original banner from the welcome center, and they even had the Jurassic Park 29 jeep that had been John Hammond's in the first movie. They didn't just refer to Jurassic Park; they made it part of the new Jurassic World. They showed us a glimpse back to the original movie without remaking it.The dialogue in the movie could have been better at times. Especially with the movie having four writers credited for the screenplay. There wasn't any line that you'd walk out of the movie remembering. Unlike the first movie which had several.As a big fan of the original movie, this movie was what I was hoping it would be. It brought me back to Jurassic Park, yet at the same time brought me a new story with a couple of familiar faces.",Jurassic World

I went to the pictures as a kid to watch the first one, and I'm absolutely glad I was talked into going to watch this one with my fiancé all these years later, who also watched the first one at the time. Dinosaurs, although obviously not real, are still pretty cool to look at, and they look absolutely boss in this film! And that's why I don't get why people are moaning about it. I think that the idea of a bigger , angrier, smarter dinosaur wasn't the most original idea admittedly, but again, as dinosaurs ARE NOT REAL anyway, it hardly matters. This film was boss because it was quite jumpy at times, funny at times, and during loads of it I found myself thinking how cool it all was, and how I was gutted that dinosaurs actually don't exist to run riot, because it all actually looked quite good fun. Anyway, I've been telling anyone who has listened to go and watch it since last night, and this is actually the first time I ever wrote a review for anything, I just felt I should when I noticed how much the ratings had dropped since it came out , for mad reasons such as being predictable.

The film is cleverly made and the storyline is credible and in my opinion not to far fetched as you would expect from an American produced film. It touched on the reality aspect that mankind want to control nature and use this as a way of profit by creating a dinosaur (asset) bigger and stronger than all. The theme tune of what we all know well has been slowed down and is played at the right points in the film which adds a nice effect. I also like the scene where they find the old building from the original park which brought us back to the original film and provided a nice touch.

Something new... Something... Exciting. This film had everything any avid movie-goer would enjoy, and if you are a fan of these films, I can only imagine how much you are going to love this one. Chris Pratt did a fantastic job as the lead role, and honestly I was one of the few people who wasn't completely sold on his part when the movie was announced. Tons of action, tons of spectacular CGI and even some nostalgic shots of the original film. If you love dinosaurs and everything that goes into making a modern day dino-thriller, you have to see this movie. 8/10 for me (strong contender as the best Jurassic movie)",Jurassic World
1427,laurenfrey,"Finally, the sequel we've been waiting for!",9,17 June 2015,"First, the bad stuff, because there's very little of it, IMO.The movie really could have done without the love story between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's characters. It wasn't that the two didn't have good chemistry, but really, had the movie taken it out, it wouldn't have changed a thing. The parents getting a divorce was unnecessary as well. The older son kinda irked me too. Was it really necessary to have him staring at each and every pretty face he came across? The good stuff: I did like the brother's relationship, it started out as typical siblings, but when the danger started, they took care of each other. I LOVED how well the relationship worked between Chris Pratt and the raptors. I also liked how the movie actually acknowledged why the dinosaurs looked the way they looked, like why the raptors didn't have feathers, etc. There were a lot of great references to the first movie, and even though we only got one original cast member back, BD Wong was a great choice.The whole cast was good. Chris Pratt, loved him. Vincent D'Onofrio was a cheesy/obvious villain, but for this movie, it worked. I didn't like Bryce Dallas Howard's character at first, but she grew on me. A lot of complaints I've seen say that the humans weren't dimensional enough, but the movie is called Jurassic World, it's supposed to be about the dinosaurs, and they were awesome.Now, I've heard complaints that the CGI is bad. To me, it's not. Jurassic Park 3 had bad CGI, it was painfully obvious that the spineosaurus (I think that's what it was called) wasn't there. But none of the dinosaurs in this movie looked fake to me. The raptors were awesome, the Indominus Rex was awesome, and the final battle was just epic. I've seen this movie twice now, and I will see it again.",Jurassic World
1428,indrakeerthi,dinosaur with such intelligence??,6,14 June 2015,"The ending is pretty hard to swallow . First part of the movie was good , but depiction of dinosaur with such intelligence.Even primates would not behave like that , such a shame .I loved the first movies because they were trying to be so accurate in terms of dinosaur behaviors they felt real and original .but this movie is poor in science but as an action movie people would love it. Don't be fooled by trailers or they hype created by the marketing. This is just any other movie ..Jurassic World looks expensive, has some fantastic shots but unfortunately nobody seemed to care about writing interesting characters or story lines. And if the characters are so badly written it's not surprisingly that the actor's deliver poor work.",Jurassic World
1429,kulharishirish,"Solid action movie; not so good in the ""adventure"" aspect",8,14 June 2015,"Hopefully this review will be useful to non-fans and those new to the franchise as well.What made the first Jurassic Park so great was mostly the sense of wonder it evoked in children and adults alike, and also the initial slow buildup of tension that led to great fast-paced action sequences in the later part. In other words, it wasn't just an action movie, but a proper ""adventure/action"" movie, with a perfect balance of both elements. I watched JP1 as a kid and can safely say that it was one of the most awe-inspiring experiences of my childhood.How does Jurassic World measure up in these areas? It does try to evoke that sense of wonder with the tried and tested scenes of huge herbivores in huge fields, shots of helicopters flying past waterfalls, etc. However, it's not effective because we've all seen it before, plus after two decades we're used to jaw-dropping graphics, so it's rare for us to be impressed by CGI-rendered scenes. It also tries to build up tension, but unfortunately, this buildup doesn't last long (I won't say more than this so as not to spoil the plot). Therefore the ""adventure"" aspect of Jurassic World is much weaker than that of JP1.As for the acting, Pratt does a reasonably good job, while the others are kind of meh. The kid actors were horrible, in my opinion. Their ""terrified"" expressions on seeing a super-predator trying to kill them were laughably bad. Their acting is the weakest aspect of the entire movie (again, in my opinion), not even close to the kid actors in Jurassic Park 1.In spite of all this, the second half of the movie is -really- good. Some of the action sequences are incredibly nice, and the ending scenes are some of the best in the entire JP franchise. Sure, these scenes may be predictable, but they're done well and I'm sure most of the audience won't mind. As far as I'm concerned, the second half made up for all the above-mentioned problems. (And the absolute last scene is really awe-inspiring!) So all in all, Jurassic World is a great action movie that IMO is comparable to The Lost World (although many people will be divided on this), but still does not hold a candle to the first Jurassic Park. Even so, I'd say both fans and non-fans alike should give this a try.==========================================================I'd also like to address some reviews panning the film because of the characters' stupidity. What did you expect? The premise of the movie was bound to involve some people doing stupid stuff involving dinosaurs, that's why there would be consequences, and that's what would lead to all the dinosaur-related action. How else do you make a movie that's story-wise a sequel to disastrous events 20 years ago? I don't even know why those reviewers went ahead and saw the movie knowing fully well that it would inevitably have these stupid characters/actions.",Jurassic World
1430,cody-74317,Major Deficiency of Jurassic World --- include spoilers ---,7,14 June 2015,"Im a huge fan of Jurassic Trilogy, thats why I was quite disappointed when I it. The major defect of this movie is light speed story telling from the beginning to the end, like you put full gas on the pedal. It was too quick. Another lack of movie is, that you didn't enjoy the attractions because there are really no attractions to see at all. I was expected that those two kids will enjoy I don't know, baryonyx paddock, suchomimus paddock, T-Rex kingdom, I mean they've got 18 species on the official website and you barely see half of them. It will be cool to have at least half an hour cruise around the park attractions and actually see those species that they 've got on website. Another thing is connection to the main characters. In my point of view, there is no real connection to the human characters, because it seem that director wants you to connect to the dinosaurs(I really don't care if those two kids or claire or owen will die, but when they kill raptor I felt really bad) so it is literally jurassic world because they've got the main role(). It was really fun, because when you see mosasaur killing indominus out of nothing just like that, well I already see honest trailer. Too much intelligence for the dinosaurs, a little for humans, no epic cruise around the park, quick action scenes, this were the moments that literally let me down a little. If you see most of the trailers, TV spots and movie clips, congratulation you already see most of the movie. It is really good summer popcorn blockbuster movie, thats it, nothing more, nothing less.",Jurassic World
1431,avega-42808,Dumb Fun,6,14 June 2015,My favorite movie of all time is the original Jurassic Park; I won't directly compare this movie to this one. However several times this movie will reference the events and characters of the original movie. Overall I found the movie fun and enjoyable because of the action scenes but I had lots of problems with the plot and characters. Simply put Jurassic World is a dumb fun action movie.Jurassic world looks stunning in 3D and is one of the best visual representations of what 3D can do that I seen all year.

Loved the little dinosaurs (this will not let me call them what they truly are, it says I am spelling it wrong)...the acting was top rated.Special effects were out of this world. You must absolutely see this in 3D!You will not be disappointed with this one at all. A Big Thumbs Up! Unlike the previous two after the original, this one will keep you captivated every single moment. You will honestly get so wrapped up in the movie and with the 3D, you will honestly believe the critters are coming out at you!

1433,amelialaviolette,Well I liked the park,5,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World ReviewBefore I start off this review, I feel it must be made clear that I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be terrible. I thought its very existence was an insult to the original great movie which showed why not to mess with DNA. What I got out of this movie was mixed feelings and confusion. I shall try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible, but I can't make any promises. If you don't want spoilers, you should probably stop reading this right now.I will start with what I liked about the movie. The park was amazing. It came across as Hammond's dream come true. Once I saw the dinosaur petting zoo and the triceratops rides I wanted to go there immediately. I was absolutely enthralled on seeing this park operate and all the rides it had. The homages to the original movie gave a sense of nostalgia. They had some scenes reenacted from the first movie, but my favorite parts were when they went to the original sets from the first movie. Finding the night vision goggles, the jeeps and such made me giddy in my seat.Larry is the best character in this movie. That's all I can really say about him. He's funny, he's smart, he has plastic dinosaurs on his work desk (think Wash from Firefly) and he's probably the only sane person in the entire park.Now we shall look on the things I didn't like from the movie. The dinosaurs in the movie didn't act like dinosaurs. While Steven Spielberg in the first movie knew he was making a monster movie, he went out of his way to make the dinosaurs act like animals to the point of bringing in a paleontologist on set to give advice. The velociraptors and the indominus rex in particular acted so unrealistically that it took me out of the movie.The velociraptor training was an absolutely stupid idea. They've built up so much in all 4 movies how dangerous velociraptors are that I could never take the idea seriously. Granted, they did show wisdom by having the training done outside of the cage rather than inside like I originally thought. The reason WHY they're training the raptors was the also amazingly stupid, which I will not reveal in this review for spoiler reasons. However, the most disappointing part of the velociraptor training was that eventually it amounted to nothing. It was built up from the trailers and the end results were very boring.Finally, we have the indominus rexoh boy do I have a few words on this guy. The indominus rex is actually the sole reason I was thinking of not going to see Jurassic World. I feel that if Michael Crichton were alive, he would smack the screen writers upside the heads and say ""NO!"" It is revealed very early that the people who made Jurassic World were very aware of what happened in the first park. Indeed, they even have Dr. Wu, the chief scientist from the original park on their staff. Because people have short attention spans, the investors of the park wanted something ""cool"" to wow the audience of the park, since dinosaurs are not interesting enough on their own. So the indominus rex is cooked up; a genetic hybrid of T rex, raptor, cuttlefish (yes cuttlefish), and other lovely creatures that makes it bigger, badder, and more vicious than the other dinosaurs. Since the chief killers in any previous events with Jurassic Park are velociraptors and T rexes, it is only natural to combine their combined lethality together. Every scene with the indominus rex just annoyed me, it felt so forced and out of place to make this park fail when it didn't have to. I seriously would have enjoyed this movie more if the dinosaurs DIDN'T get out. I enjoyed the first half of the movie far more than the second half. The park itself is creative and inventive and makes up for the lackluster plot and unspectacular effects.",Jurassic World
1434,rebelhollar,The Writing team,7,14 June 2015,"The movie was good, I give it that the special effects the visuals. Everything they did to bring this movie to life, since Micheal Crichton is no longer here to write new stories, his books (Jurassic Park and the Lost World) is what made those two movies great as they were. Hollywood seen how people loved the movies they made JP3 which was an okay film I give it a 8/10 the story matched up with the books about the animals being on the second site, and now Jurassic World is on the concept of the back story but the writers to me could not find a way to make there story fit in with the others,they should of focused more time on better story then cool features for a more futuristic park.",Jurassic World
1435,onlinestudio-68041,Made for a 10 year old,3,15 June 2015,"My first review prompted only by the terribly annoying so called ""3D"" movie that had plastic-like dinosaurs and a very very poor story-line.Imagine a woman who doesn't take her high heels off when she is running in the mud, running from a T-rex, running from a raptors, from all kinds of things. Imagine a hero who goes to fight a fearsome rogue dinosaur much worse than a T-Rex with a shotgun. Imagine kids who were almost killed several times by raptors and the same huge dinosaur but who not only don't get scared but give each other high fives and ""wait till I tell mom"". Imagine when in the heat of the tragedy that dinos are killing people and are all set loose the main actors decide to give each other a kiss. Imagine a woman who calls a T-rex and runs slowly (again in high heels)from a T-rex that seems to now have emotions. Let me mention she then hangs around just watching as two dinos fight. Literally below them.....No don;t assume these above mentioned scenes will get your heart pumping....actually almost NO excitement at all.....cliché actually... Now imagine 20 more fake scenarios and scenes that assume you are a 10-12 year old and meant to take your money and remake almost the exact same storyline as the previous version.

1436,chrisbanagas,I Signed Up To Tell You How Bad This Film Is,1,15 June 2015,"This was absolutely TERRIBLE! It was extremely predictable and just so fake. The first half felt you were watching Godzilla and the last half was full of the most ridiculous scenes ever. From The main character riding a motorcycle with velociraptors, the velociraptors becoming his best friend to the main characters standing in public while pterodactyl's are going rampage destroying the place. I was awaiting this film for ages and I have never been so disappointed that I needed to comment. The acting was terrible and I believe the old cast were needed. Honestly If you watch it I promise you, you will absolutely feel that you just wasted your time. If it was me deciding how it was done i would of brought the old cast going back to the park after 22 years even though they always say they won't. Just in remembrance of John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) but then something goes wrong. To sum everything up the movie was terrible. Mercedes probably made a lot as I found it more interesting seeing the jeep in the film than the movie. Acting war poor and terrible plot.",Jurassic World

Although the movie could have added a few minutes of showing how the park was rebuilt but besides that the movie is pretty awesome. I totally enjoyed this movie and watched it a total of 3 times so far. I would recommend this movie to everyone 12 and up and would expect a majority of people to enjoy this roller coaster of Dinos. I enjoyed the CGI (even though there were times you could tell there was obvious CGI) and the acting overall was good. The director and his team put in allot of work in this movie and the years of waiting for JP 4 was totally worth it. Welcome, to Jurassic World.",Jurassic World
1438,kevinbraic,Obvious lack of authenticity is the movie's downfall,3,15 June 2015,"I was as most of the young adults in the cinema excited to view this title as a way to remember and once again experience the Jurassic park franchise. Motivated by childhood nostalgia and enthusiasm for the earths 65 million year old rulers I thought i could overlook the apparent fallacies that I realized the movie was going to present after being given through the trailer an extremely and ridiculous synopsis of the movies plot.I try as a hard as i can to make this a relevant and coherent review as it is not in my character to give fair arguments for my position when my opinion is a hateful one.Now... 65 million years in the sucking created the worst artistic abomination of the century.Characters: The characters in the movie are so predictable and overused in such a way that it almost feels as if the screenwriter found these characters in a screenplay 101 manual. The cool teenager, the smart and emotional kid, the moral guy who never compromises his principles etc.Not that it is anything wrong with using these type of knowable characters but the problem with them in this movie is their verbal delivery. You almost at first impression know what type of persons they are and are going to become, this as a consequence of the lines being so obvious that you almost assume the character's lines has been copied from a sort of beginners lesson in ""personal development for movie characters"" with the use of the overused ones as mentioned before.When this is taken into consideration it is easier to understand why it's hard to feel for these bleak and sloppy made characters and why someone would try to justify a position which regards them as such. This is crucial even in a monster movie like this in which its prequels puts a strong emphasis on relationship problems.Effects: There is something tragically funny when a movie made 22 years after the Jurassic park original has worse effects than the first movie. In the first minute a jackdaw created in the form of CGI emerges and the hope of decent imagery is in about a blink of an eye lost.Plot: The plot is absolutely ridiculous and it's impossible to believe the story the movie is trying to sell us. A genetic modified T-Rex?? is created to make the park more enjoyable to it's customers. But it escapes and terrorizes the park's inhabitants, both human and non-human alike. Raptors are maybe going to save day and in the same time be used in a military experiment?, or a T-Rex with his friend the rapt are going to save the day from the lab monster?It's almost close to science fiction in it's expression. The cliché overused humor tormenting your intelligence or the absurd location premise where the main characters are always at the wrong place at the wrong time are revealing just how terrible this movie is in it's attempt to catch the crowd's interestA horrible movie, plain and simple. A utter waste of time. Artistic suicide. The little kid inside my heart is certainly disappointed by this filthy garbage.",Jurassic World
1439,hannahharris-71336,How freaking AWESOME is it that they made a new JP film!?!?,7,16 June 2015,"HOW FREAKING AWESOME IS IT THAT THEY MADE A NEW JP FILM!? I was actually squirming in my seat as the opening credits started to roll. (Note to self – to prevent severe anxiety in future, ditch your mates and see a highly anticipated film on opening day, instead of waiting 4 DAYS so you can see it with your Buds. The struggle was real). I mean, look, I'd seen the trailer, I knew going in that it looked a bit shady, some dodgy dialogue and hollow characters, but that didn't dampen my excitement – I mean, its Jurassic Park man!! Right?!?! Dun Daaaa, Dun Daaa, Dun Dun Daaaaa, da dun dun daaaaaaaa.So if you've been fan-girling over this film like me in the lead up to its release, here's some truths that can set your mind at ease. It's not terrible. It doesn't ruin the franchise (At least no more than #3 did – William H Macy, Tea Leoni, I'm lookin at you dudes). Chris Pratt continues to be awesome. Dinosaurs are BADASS.The script however, is not. The plot of this film (The Park is open, scientists created a crazy scary monster hybrid dinosaur, you've seen the promos) is almost irrelevant, it's simply a vehicle that gets us to our most desired destination – Seeing big-ass dinosaurs tearing s**t up. Characters are given exceptionally weak set-ups that are so uninteresting that my patience was tested – get to the dinosaurs already!! Chris Pratt rocks as a Raptor trainer (a concept not as far-fetched as the trailer will lead you to believe) however other than channeling his inner Burt Macklin, there's really not much to him. And Jessica Chastain as his co-lead is a total bore – without going too Patricia Arquette on you here, is it too much to ask to have a strong female lead it a film as huge as this? Chastains Claire is your stereotypical uptight and overworked single woman, who has it all except for a man in her life spew. I was half expecting her and Pratt to do the old 'accidently fall on top of each other and almost kiss' moment but thankfully it didn't happen.An over-riding theme of the film is the argument that this Hybrid dinosaur was an unnecessary addition to the park – Dinosaurs are cool enough. You gotta wonder then, how this concept was missed by the writers in applying the same idea to the story. This unstoppable beast of a monster makes the film seem less grounded in the reality that we are used to from the previous films, and more of a fantasy land that is less accessible. No spoilers here, but it's not until the T-Rex is brought in that I felt that old rush of excitement that I had 20 years ago – Dinosaurs are cool enough.But it's still not awful. It's lazy, for sure, and for a film that was pretty much certain to make a TONNE of moula a lot more effort could have gone into making this movie as good as the first. But man, it's still Jurassic Park, still has that feel, that excitement, that sense of fun. And no matter what the reviews, you're still gonna watch it. So go watch it!",Jurassic World
1440,zfidy,Can't get near the first Jurassic Park movie,4,16 June 2015,"This movie is complete trash. It has no memorable moments at all. There is no storyline and logic what so ever. The movie consists of running and chasing scenes mostly. The CGI on the velociraptors looks completely unreal and kills the atmosphere. Due to the CGI the acting is terribly bad as well. There are no emotions noticeable. The whole movie has a blue layer of fog on it because of the CGI which makes it look even worse. All in all, Jurassic World does not come nowhere near Jurassic Park. Even though the technology has improved the movie has not. I do not recommend watching this movie in theaters.",Jurassic World
1441,opmg,Terrific world,9,26 July 2015,"To be quite honest I came into this movie carrying a few negative biases. A first one against the Jurassic franchise, which I've never been a huge fan of. A second one against 4th installments in film franchises (that's right Crystal Skull, I'm looking at you). And a third one against easy, bigger-is-better blockbuster. One by one, this film destroyed these biases. The cast's performance, led by an astonishing Chris Pratt was tremendous (even though child actors will remain child actors). The new park was as immersive as one could have ever hoped for. The link made to the rest of the franchise was not only skillful but impregnated with a subtlety unknown to blockbusters. The film was overall one of the most terrific movie-going experiences I've ever had. Not only immersive, thrilling and wowing, but also quite reflective on the effects of consumerism on our society.",Jurassic World

1443,asheil-37676,Worse than JP3,1,18 June 2015,"Let me start by saying that I love dinosaurs. As a kid, I would spend hours in the library reading about them and their awesome size and power. I loved the original movie, and I thought its sequel, ""Lost World"" was even better. If you have any respect for those films, do not give up your money to see this movie. First off, it is riddled with extremely ostentatious product placement. The movie opens with a close up of beats by dre. No, seriously. There is a kid with beats on in the middle of the screen for at least 2 minutes. Later in the movie, the heroine is driving an armored truck. What is on the front of said truck? A GIANT Mercedes logo. And those are only two of the many ads in the film. The other major problem is that zero effort was put into writing. Clumsy homages and continuity errors riddle this film. Basically, it bears the name ""Jurassic Park"", but it has the writing of ""Dinoshark"". Bottom line: It's rare that a movie makes me angry, but this one did. (This is coming from a guy that has watched the entirety of ""Titanic 2""). If this film were a standalone, it might be a 4, but such poor execution on a long awaited and greatly anticipated franchise is unacceptable. This movie is thoughtless, eye candy garbage, and its success is setting up equally terrible films for the future. So do yourself a favor. When your friends tell you how great this movie is, nod politely, change the subject, go home, warm up some popcorn, gather up the family, and watch the original or sequel instead.

Especially the over the Dinosaur wrestling brawls. Despite the movie being over the top, I have to admit I was never bored, and it was fun to watch, although the Jurassic franchise has been considered to a certain degree a family movie, I found Jurassic World a bit on the gorier level. Not for little kids. But that's just my personal opinion.They were several over the top dinosaur killing moments that were kind of unjustified particularly the scene in which the assistant gets killed, I found that very exaggerated the character was also one that didn't make it in the film, It would have made more sense if Hoskins had a death like that it would have been Epic. But to watch a character that wasn't really antagonistic get brutally murdered, I felt it was pointless.",Jurassic World
1445,cathrinechalupka,"It's about the message, not only the effects.",9,19 June 2015,"To clarify the situation we got here. Jurassic World is a total new movie and not to be compared with the Jurassic Park trilogy. All in all it was a nice movie and not so predictable as some people claim. Knowing the Jurassic Park trilogy you might have guessed but since its a new movie it can't be connected to the trilogy. In an interview it is being said that they created this in the first place for the new generation but involved props of the old trilogy to let us remember specific moments. Like the car, the night vision devise etc.In fairness there were some scenes where the animation wasn't as good as one might expect it, but still, the storyline was nice. And added to that, the music is really enchanting. The music must be a tribute to the old trilogy as well. If you watched it the ""regular"" version you might not be totally caught in the storyline, but watching in 3D, IMAX version it could give you jump-up moments you might not have. And the subliminal message is also nice. For people who just watch the characters jump and run without considering the all-in-all it might be a fail.",Jurassic World
1446,gmason-66764,Plot - facile rubbish: Effects - quite good.,4,19 June 2015,"I received the tickets for nothing - and they were worth every penny.After watching a film, do you ever get the feeling ""I could have written something better than that.""? Well, here's an opportunity to easily write something better. ""Predictable"", and ""trope"" hardly do justice to the production-line effort to make money.The film starts with a couple sending off their two sons to Jurassic World. Pointlessly, it transpires they are in the throes of a divorce. Is the unfolding adventure going to bring them together? We never find out - so why include it? At one point, thousands of pterodactyls escape - as the film ends, they are all still out there somewhere unless they are homing pterodactyls.Bryce Dallas Howard starts off as the killer business Exec, with in minutes she realises the futility of this and reverts to the weak female and from then on sets back all progress in gender-equality and obviously wants to be a housewife and have lots of babies with the Pratt character.Pratt's character, the dinosaur trainer (yes, I know... a dinosaur trainer) is the clean-cut hero you've seen millions of times: you know he's immortal and will have a few good lines... he has two in 124 minutes.The basis of the story revolves around the ""trainability"" of Velociraptors and the idea that they can communicate and plan better than the average human. OK, this comes from the ""Jurassic Park"" - but Velociraptors having a conversation with an overgrown T-Rex...? Yeah, I agree, it's OK for kids... but not if you're over 10.There is the standard mad scientist, the standard megalomaniac and deluded villain (just like Jurassic Park) I suppose they are there to use up the discarded words from earlier Jurassic scripts.Why 4/10?

It may seem like I'm giving it an easy 10/10 but it does what it's meant to do, and that's entertain as a JP sequel: As a sequel to JP it hearkens back to all the major JP themes and moral questions in a satisfactory way. Also, it's much better than JP 2 and on a completely different level vs. JP 3. 10/10 because it's a solid blockbuster JP film and great to go see with your family and friends.

If you are looking for an amazing story line or something like that, then you will not be getting it from this movie. I don't understand why people are always looking at these dinosaur movies as horrible because the story was horrible or whatever the reason is. Its a dinosaur movie...the story is going to always be the same. Most of the time. It was great. Simple as that. I'm not really a fan of Chris Pratt but he did pretty good in this movie. I laughed on a few of his parts. Which is unusual for me. I like when he isn't trying to hard, then he is genuinely funny. Hes a good actor in my opinion.",Jurassic World
1450,camrondore,A really fun ride and I'll certainly watch it more than once!,10,21 June 2015,"A really thrill of a ride. The Indominous Rex was a really cool idea and handed well. A lot of action and storyline. Most characters developed well and the last scene was a peach! However, there were some faults but they didn't destroy the film in any way, shape or form.The park was introduced in a very modern way and the teenager was like he would be, on his phone when there are dinosaurs!!! Staring at girls of course while queuing for the Gyrosphere was also very relatable.Glad the Trex animatronic came back...and didn't die because that would have disappointed me as it would have been a Jurassic Park 3 repeat. Though my jaw-dropped at the awesomeness that was when the Trex and Velociraptor fought together against the I-Rex. Seriously a really good film and (in my opinion) competes for the best of the four films.",Jurassic World

I thought the musical score was also the weakest of any Giacchino movie score I have heard. My advice is to see the film on the big screen but there is no need to fight the crowds. Then go home and watch the original again. The first once is SO much better in every way than this one.Despite how bad this film is, it will remain #1 for some time and, due to the extreme revenue it will produce, we will be given a Jurassic V. I just hope whoever writes the screenplay for that film tries something new. Also, perhaps the can give the cast some dialogue worth voicing. The lines these poor actors had to speak were worse than those used in the Star Wars films!My rankings of the Jurassic movies (1 = best):1. Jurassic Park 2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park II 3.

I was still in interest of Jurassic World(1993),but I think every first one of the movie is the best. At the beginning of stories was boring,one family's sons went Jurassic world,and stories made us very anxious.I want to see when main character of dinosaur killed many people and other dinosaur,but I was afraid to see,like a kindergartner.Some times I screamed, then grasped mu friend's hand.And the movie was 3D so I thought that I was a heroine,I felt that I was inside the movie..

While that still could be the audience's fault for they did not acknowledge the fact that the only reason the first 3 prequels ""jurrasic park 1/2/3"" was a hit because of the advance animation of that time. Which led to the audience getting over-hyped about their sequel jurrasic world. I've seen only a bit of improvement in animation from the the previous movies and that was nearly 10 years ago! Not to mention certain other movies like transformers and avengers which probably only had a dinosaur scene for 2 minutes had equivalent graphics. I also feel that the movie was based solely on the main plot ,of a dinosaur on a rampage, which is very similar as its prequels. It had nothing standing out other than its new breeds of dinosaur. Probably a few more side plots could have made it a nudge more interesting , for its sad humour didn't do the trick. Overall i feel you should still give it a try as it is a sequel of a Brailling movie , but do go into it with an acceptance of the same plot and don't forget to admire the cast and chris pratt.",Jurassic World

It has no taste, no dedication or even enough thought into it. How can they spend so much money and not care about the plot?Why nobody cares when the first 2 people die eaten by a monster dinosaur? And when a whole team of soldiers die right after them? Is it supposed to be OK that Clair does not evacuate the whole Island from minute 1? Why weren't they consistent throughout the whole movie regarding the Dinosaur's heat detection? What's up with the lack of terror, chill, thriller? Everything was just so predictable and extremely annoying.They started off good by showing off the whole Island of Jurassic World being compared to SeaWorld or other unethical zoos. How the owners treat the animals as ""assets"" or ""products"" instead of considering them as Animals with feelings even if they were actually produced in the lab.It could have followed that line and it would have been tremendously better. But no.. It stopped half way through.I'm not a movie freak or a Jurassic Park super fan, it just got me angry that they can get so much money out of this.Still for entertainment I guess it's good.

No one tells the evacuating pedestrians to seek shelter until the pterodactyls arrive? People are dying left and right and the main characters are smiling and giggling...?

After all these years and no worthy Jurassic Park film to talk about, this little or should I say HUGE gem comes along. Do not listen to any of the reviews stating that acting is awful, it's predictable, clichéd and what have you, because it most definitely is NOT and is the best possible sequel to the first Jurassic Park to date. Now I am a HUGE Jurassic Park fan and (what could have been to my detriment) went in having massive expectations for this movie. And was I disappointed with the overall movie? Absolutely not!After Jurassic Park 3, all Jurassic Park fans were crying out for a worthy succession to Spielberg's masterpieces and this is definitely a worthy addition. The CGI looks amazing and the ""Jurassic World"", looks spectacular. The acting by both Pratt and Howard is superb and is well backed up by the supporting cast. The only gripe I have is a minor hole in the storyline, however I will not let that detract from what is definitely a fantastic, well rounded movie.All in all, it is both fun and exhilarating and if you are a returning Jurassic Park fan or just a regular moviegoer it is well worth a watch and is sure to not disappoint.",Jurassic World
1459,prashanthkotla,Relies WAY too much on the nostalgia of the first movie wit h nothing unique of its own,4,23 June 2015,"OK, I wanna start by getting something out of the way: this movie is the sequel to THE Jurassic Park. As such, one would expect the movie to have that level of intellect, suspense, and a fantastic plot. The actual movie is nothing like this! I'm an avid fan of the series and the first movie is easily my favorite movie of all time. I went into this movie more biased than the average movie-goer because I personally wanted this movie to live up to the sheer awesomeness of the first and I was willing to accept many more flaws than most people and I would've been satisfied if this movie was even 50% as good as the first. BUT, it wasn't even 30% as good! First things first, there is absolutely NO PLOT. There's no real background information on how they managed to even reclaim Isla Nublar after the first movie, its just an unexplained given. You don't even know the motivation of any of the characters, they all just happen to end up on the island after the first five minutes of the plot. The characters themselves are EXTREMELY stereotypical; the children are ridiculously stupid, Bryce Dallas Howard is easily scared and portrayed as weak while the main villain of the movie wanted (take a guess) to make a profit. The director mentioned that they brought back Henry Wu as his character was never really explained but he's BARELY in the movie. He had SO MUCH potential but they never expounded upon it, they could've even linked in his jealousy of Hammond but all he does is brag about how much of a genius he is. The main villain is extremely stereotypical and he doesn't even have a climatic scene, he is just abruptly killed by a raptor that appears out of NOWHERE. Like literally, a few minutes before the raptor comes, the characters are safely in the visitor center surrounded by OTHER people, they all just disappear in a matter of minutes. He dies like every other villain in every other movie. Simon Masrani (owner of the park) had SO MUCH potential and was very likable (one of the few characters who wasn't annoying). They could've expounded upon his view that they never had control, he also had links with Hammond that could AND should've been further developed. Instead, they completely kill him off just like another one of the 100's of extras in a helicopter crash. The movie is so predictable because you know for A FACT that Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and the 2 children will survive no matter what. I know the film is supposed to take place on Isla Nublar like the first, but the island looks COMPLETELY different and has no bearing to the first. Now, onto the raptors and Chris Pratt. First things first, I LOVE Chris Pratt and he's a phenomenal actor but even he can't make up for the flawed concept of training raptors. The whole point of the first movie was that nature CANNOT be controlled and that's what made the first movie so realistic and suspenseful. This movie somehow manages to portray these carnivores as heroes towards the conclusion! You can't control nature, in the first movie Sam Neil and co. barely escape the island and the vicious raptors, yet in this movie the raptors save them. I just don't get it! What would Ian Malcolm think?? I honestly wish the raptors could have been conveyed in a more realistic manner. Now onto the Indominus Rex: it starts off as a convincing villain but somehow manages to avoid trained security officers, helicopters with machine guns, bazookas, etc. without a scratch because we know that she is being saved for Chris Pratt. Despite being able to avoid certain death, it can't even see Chris Pratt when he's hiding 1 inch from its mouth??? It goes against Jurassic Park and nature in general, she even kills for sport!? They completely overpower her. In terms of plot, it's basically dinosaur escapes, kills people, Chris Pratt saves the day. In the original movie, there was so much more suspense while its a CGI show in this movie. On a positive note, there were many easter eggs and allusions towards the first movie but I felt that they relied far too much on nostalgia from the first to make the sequel any more unique or suspenseful. I felt like the old theme park should have played a larger role in the plot of the sequel since they already relied on so many nostalgic moments from the first to spice up the very bland plot. Still, there were some scenes that really referenced the first movie in an awesome manner. Finally, I've noticed many people saying that its a summer flick with CGI and action and that we should enjoy it for what it is. I respect their opinions but I'll have to politely disagree with them. When you're following up one of the greatest films every arguably made, there's an amount of respect and care you should take when making the sequel. It saddens me that such a phenomenal movie can be followed by a popcorn flick like this. The original was a masterpiece that showed that man cannot control nature, that nature finds a way, and that ignorance is bliss UNTIL the power goes out and everything goes to hell while maintaining suspense and a plot. All in all, this movie is worth checking out for 2 hours of fun, but don't expect any quality remotely near the first movie.",Jurassic World

Do you want all of the dinosaurs to just remain in their cages and no action happens? Second, those same people who say that the raptors being ""good guys"" are dumb, you didn't want predictability so why did you want the raptors who are the main villains of the first movie and also in the second and third movies to be villains again? I thought it was a nice welcomed change. The ending of the movie I loved because it wasn't what I was expecting and I don't most people were expecting either though it maybe was a little cheesy but I still loved it. Third, those saying the acting was horrible, I kinda agree, the acting was a bit off and there are some bland characters but I think they're are more entertaining actors other than Pratt and besides its Jurassic World, its a dinosaur movie! People want to see dinosaurs! People want to get lost in their imagination of dinosaurs and what they could become. Granted there are a lot of product placing throughout the movie which was a little distracting.

Story: One of it's falls-on-its-face aspects. The story is pretty bad, except for the part where we actually FINALLY (After 3 movies, 2 books, and PLENTY of video games) saw the park in action. 5/10 Acting: The acting was actually okay. Chris Pratt was the cool action hero, Bryce Dallas Howard was the strong female scientist, and the kids were, well, the kids. Also, I will say Vincent D'Onofrio was pretty good too, playing the kind of equivalent to Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) from the first movie. 7/10 Action: Let me put out there that other than Avengers 2 and Furious 7, Jurassic World has been one of the most fun films I have seen this year. REALLY. The tag-team battle at the end of the film with the T-Rex, the Raptors, and the Mosasaurus against the I-Rex! COME ON!

1463,itzthenick,Fun but Dumb!,7,24 June 2015,"There is no doubt this is the best of the Jurassic Park sequels, although there are more than a couple of stupid moments and cheesy quotes that put you off.In terms of the dinosaurs, they're awesome, very well done CGI. Personally I'm not a big fan of the Raptors being the good guys, that is one of the most stupidest parts of the film, I think I'd much prefer them being in an isolated cage and breaking out somehow but unfortunately the dog-trained Velociraptors play an important part in the plot of the film.The ""Indominous Rex"" is a pretty fun idea but could have killed more people in my opinion because sometimes, especially when the pterodactyls broke out the Indominous didn't feel like the scariest and most dangerous dinosaur. I do like the Messasaurous or whatever the giant crocodile-like underwater dinosaur was called and it played much bigger role in the climax of the film than I thought eating the Indominous.The acting performances in the film are good but the dialogue on the other hand is not. Some lines especially at the end of the film are very cheesy and didn't need to be there.

Some kind of swimming dinosaur ate a shark i think, some kids were attacked by a dinosaur inside a hamster wheel thing and a red head who was kinda hot are just a few things that I can recall. Chris Pratt was pretty cool too, he was some kind of raptor whisperer and a pretty wild guy too. The original Jurrassic Park is definitely the best one but this one is pretty cool.

Some really obvious instances of sexism too like where one woman tells another it's ""when not if"" she will have kids and where two boys are more impressed with a man reversing a jeep than a woman taking out a dinosaur. They could have made it way better by just having the point be that the woman realizes the importance of family like they did for the two brothers.

1468,jintman,One of the worst scripts ever. Great Special effects couldn't save it.,1,27 June 2015,The kids liked it. Started with an interesting premise. Not a single character was believable on any level. I expect the characters in these movies to be shallow. This was beyond that. The writers seemed to have little care or any appreciation for any of the roles. The movie came across as a series of ideas for cool special effects that were then sledgehammered into place. The plot was a series of bad out- of-character choices seemingly only made to drive this movie from one cool visual to the next. Pornos have more compelling plot lines and character development. Everyone involved in the script should never get work again. Everyone involved in performing in it was clearly doing it for the cash.,Jurassic World

And he was so hungry to do so. LOL.. Plus cant understand why that T-Rex attack the hybrid dinosaur (indominus) without any reason..I think the movie got so much attention because it is ""Jurassic Park"" which all the fans really love.

This was the movie that got me hooked to Hollywood. But after the disastrous third installment, you can guess the expectations from this one for me. But to my pleasant surprise, I enjoyed this movie. It was probably in some parts due to my lack of high hopes from this one, but nonetheless, it was worth my time. Its very far from being great movie, but something that brought out that memory of the first Jurassic movie 22 years ago. Add to that the fact that the makers tipped their hat to the first movie in so many ways, the theme, the climax sequel, etc. The movie has a predictable storyline, but its intended to be enjoyed for its 3D effects and the whole saving mankind (on the island) plot. The actors have done a satisfactory job. Chris Pratt is making a lot of waves on big studio movies and I enjoyed him once again after Guardians of the Galaxy.

The 3d and CGI were the best I've ever seen and the 4DX experience of trembling and moving chairs together with smoke and water splashing in your face really made the experience much more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been. Now on to the movie. I really felt the actors were doing a good job not to over- act. The movie starts off well with quick references to the original JP movie, which maybe not everyone notices at first. The atmosphere builds up very well up until to the part where the indominus rex enclosure part, where you just know that sh*t is about to hit the proverbial fan. The 3d pans from the helicopter, the ""raptors go hunting"" scene were off the charts awesome. Of course there were some parts who some may ""judge"" to be predictable, but i sometimes wonder if some people just go to watch a movie to criticize it afterwards. Everyone's born a critic ?There were also corny messages like, if you don't work together you can't achieve anything in life or ""defeat your inner demons"" in this case a huge ""monster"". The final is very much like the original in a way, but still very enjoyable though i liked the reference to the original. Everyone is free to have their own opinion obviously. But for me a movie has to do 2 things. It has to be enjoyable without being corny and it has to immerse me in the story and keep me on the edge of my seat. When i stop watching my watch and just forget about time. If it does those things it is a success in itself and this movie does just that. If you have the option to watch it in 4Dx.. go do just that, even if you have to travel for it.. you can only watch a movie for the first time once.",Jurassic World

The movie may not be as thrilling as the Jurassic Park, but it does fill excitement and joy among the viewers through its dark humor. The primary difference between the original movie and this sequel is that this time the park has been named Jurassic World. The visitors of the park come across in the first scene a 56-foot-long dinosaur who comes out of water and eats a giant shark. The movie features special effects that are utterly breathtaking. The action scenes in the movie are also very engaging and remind a person about movie 'Jaws'. For the whole time, the movie kept me at the edge of my seat. Although movies on such subject have been released before too, but this is some fresh content after so many years. This cannot be considered as another stupid summer movie, even though it features dinosaurs fighting. On the brighter side, the movie has swiftly shown the relationship of people with the animals. There are also some clever jabs showing how the people will do anything in order to get fame. Although like before some parts of Jurassic World are also predictable and even silly, yet this movie is so far rated as the best, exciting and thrilling summer movie.

Very unbelievable because the mutant dinosaur doesn't just cause a lot of destruction, but is actually made out to be evil. I don't think a dinosaur had the intelligence, capacity, or motivation to be evil. A story line such as this could be a cartoon for children under 5 but it is insulting as a movie for adults. For example, at one point in the movie, it is shown that the dinosaur is 'killing for sport.' This is ludicrous to be believe that any animal is capable of this other than humans. Furthermore, it is unfathomable and unconscionable that Hollywood writers and producers would put out movies with such a senseless and trivial story.",Jurassic World
1477,tanejaritvik,The Generic Sequel Nobody Asked for,5,4 July 2015,"Jurassic World is a movie you can watch and immediately pinpoint a problem with. Whether it be shallow characters, awkward moments, or unnecessary events, Jurassic World insults Jurassic Park, although maybe not to the scale Jurassic Park 2 and 3 have violated the legendary first movie.In reference to characters, don't bother memorizing names. I've already forgotten the character names, and Chris Pratt is the only likable guy in this movie. That being said, there's no development of character with any person. Chris Pratt is an experienced Navy Seal at the beginning of the film and, at the end, he's an experienced Navy Seal with 3 less velociraptors and a girlfriend. Vin D'Onofrio, unfortunately, was given a limiting role that made no use of him at all--why was he even casted for such a role that literally anyone could've taken? Seemed like a waste of his time. And the relationship between the two brothers was not fleshed out or put to the test; one brother is an annoying teenager who wants to date every girl he meets, while the other is the generic young sibling fascinated with the unknown. Throughout the movie, their relationship stays the same, with occasional spurts of the older brother showing annoyance for about 5 seconds a piece. Even the cliché ""brothers hate each other but grow to support each other"" relationship would've been a better contribution to the story rather than this cr*p.I could go on and on about the characters, but I won't. I'll briefly mention how annoying and awkward the Jurassic World owner was. No one in the theater laughed at his helicopter jokes, he put on a horrible accent, and he doesn't know what he wants to be. Is he the caring park owner who puts people's security over wealth? Or is he the greedy corporate slug who wants bigger dinosaurs to generate more profit? Nobody knows because he ends up dying halfway through the movie in a freaking helicopter accident.Now, there are good points in the movie. The dinosaurs are beautifully done, although the velociraptors are not as threatening and menacing as the original Jurassic Park ones. The Indominus Rex was able to establish a sort of intimidating presence throughout the film, although the original Jurassic Park did better in terms of filming scenes with more suspense. Chris Pratt makes everything better too with good acting skills and a likable presence. Too bad it doesn't make up for all the other shortcomings.",Jurassic World
1478,e_tanoyo,high heel ON?!,5,8 July 2015,"The part when Claire run with her high heel dropped my point to low for this film. Well yes it looks sexy, but it also looks stupid for a woman running for her life with high heel while being chased by raptor & indominus. In the movie, she is able/managed to run fast in the juggle, rolling on the floor, with her high heel ON from start to end. I believe the next day, her varicose veins will come up an she wont be able to hide it for the rest of her life. Director must have a reason for this ""high heel ON"" and that reason does not make sense for me. The opening of the Jurassic world is fantastic, the music is sophisticated. Only the part where the high heel is ON dropped my point.",Jurassic World

I was so disappointed. I was told I was over-analyzing the movie because I was so sad that the main female was a moron. I feel like I was transported back in time by the idiot ""researcher"" female who is ""smart"" and ""career-driven"" but has no life skills other than that and is just dumb and afraid of anything involving complex emotion....but she really wants to be a mother! Literally, I thought I was watching one of those early Indiana Jones movie women and I was upset. Of course she was the only character that lost her clothes in the movie, stripped down to a wet tank top and skirt with a slit up to her crotch by the end, but we were supposed to eat up how ""empowered"" she became because she got dirty and helped save her nephews. Yeah, OK. So embarrassing.*Gave it a 5 cause the raptors were cute*",Jurassic World
1480,aashishkolluri,"Incredibly entertaining, long-awaited sequel!",7,27 October 2015,"In short: Jurassic World is an incredibly entertaining, long-awaited sequel. It may not have best best script in the world, but I still had a lot of fun watching it. I don't think it's as good as Jurassic park, but it is a big improvement over Jurassic Park III. It is certainly a must watch.For the curious: Visually, this movie is a massive improvement over Jurassic Park III, in term of CGI, which looks incredible, whether it be the dinosaurs or the environments. Sure a little bit of it looks meh at best, but for most part, the computer generated imagery works well. Colin Trevorrow is also great at the direction, creating lots of tension and suspense to the incredible action sequences, which are also backed up by great set designs. I don't want to spoil the nal ght scene for those who have yet to see the movie, but it is honestly my favorite action scene of the entire series so far, not just because it looks awesome, but it is just so creative, with what they did in that scene.The story line though was completely predictable and few characters like the two brothers show a weak bond towards the main storyline of the movie. Imran Khan had his versatile contribution to the movie. This pretty much sums up the characters in the movie along with the hero and heroine.",Jurassic World

Again, humans tried to work with dinosaurs, and every time it goes horribly wrong.The graphics in this movie are way better then in the Jurassic Park trilogy, but the story is pretty much the same. The new monster in this movie is awesome, especially because she (or he?) is very smart and can change color. There are a few moments which I find a little bit exaggerated, like the scene where Owen is riding on his motor with raptors. In the original movie, raptors are the most dangerous kind! So, the story is not as surprising as the other three, but still a very good sequel.",Jurassic World

The cgi was incredible and star lord he was awesome too. The indominuos rex was epic. And haters gonna hate. This movie made 1.5 billion dollars that is incredible. The acting was pretty good and the plot was pretty good too. Just enjoy the fringing movie people. The apatosauous dunno if I spelled that right was the best looking scene in the movie. It looked amazingly and epic. They actually made an actual dinosaur head. Warning huge spoiler ahead. The t rex vs I rex was epic. Especially at the end when the mososaurus came outta the water and killed it. The t rec roar at the end made chills go down my spine. A little bit gruesome too.,Jurassic World
1484,protocallservices,Get Jurassiced Why Don't You ?,8,21 July 2015,"I recall the original version of this movie. All in all this is a good film;however, in my opinion, it's simply not as thrilling as the opening movie. We really enjoyed watching it in 3D, so no complaints there. The movie was captivating, elusive and worth the extra money for 3D. The special effects were amazing but the plot and ending were sub par. While this movie reaches far, it was simply not enough to attain the status of ""great"". If you enjoy the movie experience, then you should not be disappointed, but if you wait to get it on Blu Ray, then you are not necessarily missing out either.The plot doesn't deviate much from the original so this is the millennial version at its best.",Jurassic World

Like one of the latest scenes when the girl is driven the truck and the guys are on the back with the doors opened and the velociraptor is following them. In the mind of a primitive dinosaur, the truck is other dinosaur, and the doors is the mouth being open and close, so, which animal gonna try to take some prey (the guys) on the mouth of a bigger animal? Is just a detail but i think that this scene is useless. In addition, i think that in general the film has a really good argument. Sorry for my bad English.",Jurassic World
1486,nkm-30759,Pretty Good,7,25 July 2015,"I think Jurassic World is a well done film with a strong plot and good acting. The film although wasn't able to deliver what Jurassic Park did, but overall this is a pretty decent film. I wasn't able to understand how the Indonimus Rex was able to hide itself - and this thought kept coming in my mind throughout the movie. Jurassic World left that unexplained, but I had two hours of good entertainment. Every scene made me eager to know what will happen next. However I still think that Jurassic Park was the best film in the series. In my opinion most of the times the first film of the series is always the best one with a few exceptions like Back to the Future, but Jurassic World was not bad. This film must be on your next watch list.",Jurassic World
1487,myronemaldo,A sequel that respects its original,9,26 July 2015,"I have just watched this film and i got to say, wow. This is my review of this film, spoiler free. This movie was an amazing return to the original JP island Isla Nublar. Although the plot is a little thin at some points, its still the best JP since the original Jurassic Park and i can tell, since i have bin a fan of the trilogy since the start of this franchise. If you are a fan of this franchise or just a fan of the first JP you will most likely not be disappointed by this film. The CGI looks amazing (way better than it looks in the trailers) and it works within the film. I know some people prefer animatronics to be used in a JP film and they still use them in some parts of this film, just not as much as in the original. But i like the CGI very much and i think it is THE best CGI i have ever seen in any film. So those who complain about the overuse of CGI should probably move forward with there time, cause it ain't slowing down. Now to talk about the dinosaurs and characters, first are the dinosaurs. We all know the dinosaurs in any JP film aren't accurate in terms of science, but because of the fact that they are all genetically modified beings gives the writers of JP a pass to use this, since they use the DNA of different animals in order to fill the gaps in the structure of the dino DNA so that they can create the dinosaurs we know of JP. The Velociraptors make a big return (like always) in this film, and they react and look better than ever before. The writers of this film also added a new element to this film which we have never seen before in any JP film, which is a band between human and dinosaur (Owen A.K.A. Chris Pratt and his Velociraptors). The writers also added a new, instantly beloved creature named the Mosasuarus which could have bin used in a little more scenes but lets just not argue about that. And there are side dinosaurs who are just there to fill in some time like Ankylosaurus, Apatosaurus and there is of course the famous Tyranosaurus-Rex which first seems to have only a small role in this film, but don't let her small screen time fool you, she still remains the king of the dinosaurs in this film. The dinosaurs do react like we think they would react but that is not the case with the DNA spliced Indominus Rex (which is this movies greatest star, after the t-rex of course) it is the most dangerous creature on the island and it was made to be so, but the scientists and crew of Jurassic world underestimate the creatures intelligence and so it escapes its in-habitat. The fear for this creature becomes bigger and bigger while watching this film because we learn to know how big of a threat it may be for the likable cast. Now we have talked about the dinosaurs, lets talk about the human cast shall we. Up first we have the human star of this film, Cris Pratt who plays Owen, the trainer of the Raptors and an expert on dinosaur behavior. Chris Pratt really shows his acting skills in this movie an does it in style. Next we have, Bryce Dallas Howard who plays Claire, an intelligent scientist who sees the animals on the island as simple attractions, totally forgetting the fact that they are living beings and also the main reason the Indomunus-Rex was made. Than we have the two nephews of Claire, Ty Simpkins who plays Gray and, Nick Robinson who plays Zach, who are both invited to visit Jurassic World by there aunt Claire and get into a lot of trouble caused by the outbreak of the Indominus-Rex. The film also has an amazing soundtrack which some melodies have bin re-used from the original film to Jurassic World, giving it an thrilling nostalgia feel that we can all embrace. The film also treats the original with respect as its shows to the viewer with many, many easter eggs. I could go on and on about the plot but i decided to keep this review spoiler free so that you all can experience this film in all its Glori. I hope i motivated all of you to watch this film, as it is a film worth watching. Thank you for your time and enjoy watching great films ;)﻿",Jurassic World

1490,bolonet,"Once Again, Girls Ruin Everything!",8,29 July 2015,"We've all seen it before, the teenage boy who only cares about hot girls and nothing else. In this case, his name is Zach (Nick Robinson, The Kings of Summer), and the ""nothing else"" is his little brother Gray (Ty Simpkins, Iron Man 3).Zach is very interested in girls, he apparently has a girlfriend as he says goodbye to her in the beginning of the movie. However he pretty much spends half of his time at the park eyeing girls, so.. maybe she's just a good friend? He seems to be embarrassed of his brother, often telling him to grow up when he gets excited at the park. Yeah, how dare he get excited about something other than girls, HOW DARE HE?Ahem... anyways, Gray is obsessed with dinosaurs, and his room is totally decorated to match. He even has a View-Finder with a dinosaur slide in it, I'm not sure why that felt that had to be included, but whatever. One must wonder for a boy who is so obsessed with dinosaurs, why on earth he hasn't been there yet. They didn't mention any reason why, no money issues or anything, and the park has been open since 2005! But I'm sure they had their reasons.Their parents send the brothers off by themselves to meet up with their aunt who is a big wig at the park. But of course, she is too busy to watch the boys as she places her assistant in charge. The boys grow tired of this lady who is constantly on her phone and run off by themselves.One of my most favorite parts of this movie is when the boys are watching the sea attraction and they get splashed. Zach had his cell phone out at the time and I was sure he was going to be super mad, but he wasn't. He and Gray both laughed, and it was great because their reactions felt so genuine, I guess that means they're good actors!A little later on, the boys are enjoying a leisurely ride when all of the sudden Gray drops a bombshell ""Our parents are getting a divorce"". Yikes, I imagine that would be pretty terrible to have to discuss.. if it went anywhere. They literally don't mention it again, not once, they escape the dinosaurs, reunite with their parents, hug, and then the credits role.What was the point? Trick question, there was none, it was completely pointless. It didn't make them closer, all it did was make their relationship even more awkward. Why do movies do this, why do they start story lines and then go nowhere with them, it's really quite annoying.The test tube dinosaur escapes and starts causing havoc across the park. It's explained that this dinosaur is dangerous because it has no brothers or sisters to teach it anything, in other words, it's a living breathing killing machine.While the boys are in their glass bubble driving around the park, the super dinosaur finds them and tries to make them her lunch. Fortunately they manage to escape and jump off a waterfall to safety. They survive the fall and get to shore, they both smile at each other and breathe a sigh of relief. Zach drags Gray over and hugs him which I have to admit, was probably the best scene in the entire movie (HEY... don't judge.) So the boys find a jeep and make their way back to the park entrance, they meet up with their aunt, fight off some flying dinosaurs, and their aunts assistance gets eaten. Once again someone being eaten seems like it should be a tragic event, but no one mentions it so I guess not. The super dinosaur finds its way to the park entrance and they release the T-Rex. It forces the super dinosaur next to the water where the underwater dinosaur grabs and drowns it. The boys finally reunite with their parents and the movie ends with the T-Rex roaming free.Overall I enjoyed the movie, I like that the romance stuff was kept to a minimum and the action stuff was turned up full blast. Not a fan of the sponsored rides titles (Samsung Innovation Center), even though they poked fun at it (sponsors naming dinosaurs), they still did it, and that's all that matters.In conclusion.. Ty Simpkins is a natural actor, he looked as through he was having an amazing time filming this and you definitely could tell through his acting. Whenever he was reaching for his brother in the film I felt that he was genuinely frightened. I look forward to seeing Ty in future films, and hopefully one of them will be a Jurassic World sequel.",Jurassic World
1491,matthewcallanta,The film is for family,7,2 August 2015,"I would like to commend the writer, director and the producer of the film as it is a new breed of Jurassic world with the enhanced graphics and thrilling action along the way. It is very appropriate for family bonding time. Very suitable for kids because the kissing scenes are less and skins showed are less. I will wait for the second part of this movie (hopefully there is) as it was ended openly. It brings us back to our childhood but the film itself was able to adapt to our contemporary trend through its action packed, mystery elements and it visual graphics. The dinosaurs really look like a real ones. The drama, comedy and importance of family has been reflected in the movie. The Overall the film is recommended to be watched.",Jurassic World
1492,scoobysaurus,One of the best movies of the year. JW is amazing,10,10 June 2015,"The long awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise does not fall short in delivering Dino-sized action in abundance. There's the wonder of experiencing a functional Jurassic World, the sheer awesomeness of Chris Pratt riding alongside Raptors and a psychotic hybrid monster on the loose - and if that's not enough to satisfy your appetite, they've got a crazy good finale featuring the glorious return of one of the JP fan-favourites. I'd rate it 9/10 because as a JP fan I expected a slightly longer movie, thought the trailers were a bit spoilery and wanted to see more exploration of the settings. Having said that, I think it's a thoroughly enjoyable summer sci-fi blockbuster with solid acting, great special effects and a generous dose of action, comedy and adventure.I've seen a lot of people complaining about the CGI so I'd like to take this opportunity to address the issue. The CGI is better than any previous JP movie, but the special effects fall short of creating the realism of animatronics. So yeah it's both a good and bad thing at the same time. The most detailed and realistic CGI dinosaurs would be the raptors and the I-Rex. The packed audience here in Dubai received the movie fairly well. Only 5-6 people were clapping at the end (including myself) but they reacted well to the jokes, jump scares and emotional scenes in the movie. I'd say the GA liked it. But I as a JP fan LOVED IT.",Jurassic World

If someone mention the name of movie they have a bond with i think one in hundred will probably say Jurassic Park and sure i mean who can denied the magic that movie has , so there's go Jurassic World another sequel trying capture that elements of magic again. The problem is it just failed pretty hard in almost every single element , one thing that they really doing fantastic is the CGI and production design it's amazing , it's stunning. But that's it everything else of Jurassic World is just falling apart in to pieces from boring cliché and stupid character that sometimes can be annoying to really force the ""Family Bond"" theme in to your mouth and that screenplay oh god... i mean it's like they borrow script from movie Dinocroc or something it's just really terrible , i mean it's okay in that B grade low-production value movie BUT not in the $150 million dollars budget movie and definitely not in ""Jurassic"" movies. Off course Jurassic World can be fun and for sure you will probably have a good time with it but because of it's ""Monsters Fight"" scene not because it's magic elements that Jurassic Park has , this is for sure a fun popcorn movie to watch but not the 'Jurassic' movie we hope it could be not even with Chris Pratt .",Jurassic World

1495,ahmedmuttakeen,Jurassic World complete with equally ancient clichés!,7,2 October 2015,"So, I liked this movie, but boy is it full of clichés and stereotypes. My partner and I found ourselves calling out every character, what they would end up doing within moments of being introduced to them.Seriously, there is an entire butcher's-worth of ham-fistedness in the approach to character intro's and scene building here. You'll know what will happen long in advance of it actually happening on screen.What this does is make the movie utterly predictable and, in essence, boring. At your first viewing, you will feel like you have seen it before.It also says something about a film featuring dinosaurs that it is at its best when they aren't on screen. I don't know how this came about, but, for the most part, the dino's are a little dull and uninteresting. They plod, they run, they roar, and all in glorious CGI. Yet they fail to evoke the same emotions that they did in JP1 or even 2.That's not to say the human actors are a lot better, but at least they have some thin characterisation applied to them, even if it is in the form of horrible stereotyping.I mean, military guy who is bent on weaponizing the dinos, distant aunt who has no skill with children (bet you can't guess where her story- arc evolves to?) What? Oh yeah, that's right... she does discover her nurturing instincts. Wow! You're better at this than the writers!Don't get me wrong. It is a solid popcorn flick. But the lazy writing does it tremendous harm. I swear they have some sort of software in Hollywood that churns this stuff out. There are no surprises here. None.Acting and Effects are capable. No one really stinks and there aren't that many obvious CGI moments (in so much as we know it is all CGI anyway, nothing shows itself about the perceptual parapet, as it were).It is a decent watch, but expecting the expected is no longer fun when taken to this extreme.SUMMARY: Formulaic and totally predictable. Nothing to write home about. See it, and then move on",Jurassic World
1496,kristag-68419,Movie Review of Jurassic World,9,7 October 2015,"**Contains Spoilers Continuing the saga started in 1993, a once trial theme park, Jurassic Park, was never allowed to be opened to the public until now. This new adaptation of the theme park, Jurassic World, shows the old park, renovated, if it was open to the public today. The introduction of new technologies and advances in genetic technology allows them to engineer a stronger, smarter, and more intimidating dinosaur, Indominus Rex. This new species of dinosaur becomes a strong threat to all of the tourists and other dinosaurs and leads to overall chaos when it escapes its large cage. Overall, the storyline is well told and provides a good follow up to the original Jurassic Park movies. While most of the characters are believable, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), is a little overdramatic in her role. However, Owen (Chris Pratt), demonstrated impeccable acting skills as he is faced with dangerous situations throughout the movie. The returning scientist from the original Jurassic Park movies, Henry Wu (BD Wong) provides a great connection to the past series. I also like how the new park developer, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan), is fulfilling the previous creator, John Hammond's last wishes for a park. Some of the main characters change throughout the movie. Claire changes throughout the film as in the beginning she was self-absorbed, but through her experience and ordeal, she becomes less uptight and a more compassionate person. Another character who develops throughout the movie is Claire's nephew, Zach (Nick Robinson), who changes from being self-centered to caring and protecting his younger brother. The main conflict begins when the new dinosaur Indominus Rex escapes her cage. With this threat, the previous company, InGen, takes control over the park in order to utilize other dinosaurs such as velociraptors to destroy the Indominus Rex. The movie ends in an epic battle to try and eliminate the Indominus Rex. The storyline is well written and enjoyable to watch. The interactions between all of the characters is effective and keeps the storyline believable and understandable. The characters acting abilities are highlighted throughout the movie as they have to run, fight and hide from dinosaurs who are added in by special effects later on in the film making process. The actors' abilities to produce emotions making it feel like the dinosaurs were actually chasing after them is great. Aside from a few overdramatic scenes by Claire, the acting is really believable. Location for this movie is an island with a jungle and theme park setting. The location is very interesting, connecting back to the old Jurassic Park movies as it shows the original visitor's center during the movie as being deserted and abandoned. The theme park also is interesting as it looks like any other park one would normally go to with rides, restaurants, and gift shops all pertaining to the overall dinosaur theme. The only thing that would have been an added bonus would be getting to see more of the souvenirs and places in the theme park. I thought the costumes were appropriate for most of the characters. I like how one of the control room operators had an original ""vintage"" Jurassic Park t-shirt. I feel that Claire's outfit is inappropriate for the movie because it does not match the setting well. It makes sense that she is not wearing safari clothes, but her outfit could have been better if it was a different color other than white. Some famous actors in this film include Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. The computer graphics for the movie are incredible and realistic. The music featured in the movie provides good background and increases the intensity of the film. The camera angles provide some scary scenes, especially when seeing only the large teeth and large eyes of the dinosaurs. The composition of the film is well laid out. The lighting is good except the scenes which are done at night are dark and difficult to see. Altogether the movie is interesting, exciting and thrilling. The only suggestions I would have is some less over dramatic scenes from Claire, and better lighting for the scenes filmed at night. I would recommend this movie for families, and people who enjoy adventure and thriller movies. I would definitely watch this movie again and I am excited to be able to purchase it on DVD.",Jurassic World
1497,marlon_atanacio,Jurassic World is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise.,9,8 October 2015,"Jurassic World is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. In 1993 Steven Spielberg shocked the world with these dinosaurs. Even though Jurassic Park 2 and 3 weren't as successful as the first, this fourth installment definitely revived and put a different aspect to this series. Colin Trevorrow was great with making this movie an intense thriller with comedy that is very entertaining and interesting with full of surprises.Jurassic World, the name of the original park, opened 22 years ago in 1993 in Costa Rica to entertain and inform the world about dinosaurs, unfortunately the park failed and ended with dinosaurs escaping and creating chaos everywhere. 22 years later, People weren't as amused at the dinosaurs like they were in 1993. Because of this Ingen scientists have decided to make a new breed of dinosaurs, the Indominus Rex to attract new customers for this amazing park. The Indominus Rex is a hybrid dinosaur that escaped in the park due to its unknown ability to camouflage. The story begins with 2 brothers getting V.I.P passes to the park in Costa Rica because of their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) works as a manager of the park. When they found out that The Indominus Rex escaped and went on a killing spree killing everyone and everything it sees throughout the park Claire, the park manager, asked help from an employee/trainer (Chris Pratt), which actually cares about the dinosaurs, to help her get her nephews back. The genetic monster is a big threat where there are thousands of customers/tourists throughout the park. The cinematography and the special effects of the whole film was amazing, there was so much attention to detail that CGI looked believable and real. It shot specific angles that made the movie more amazing. I like the scene when the 2 brothers where inside the ball and they were counting the dinosaurs and they notice the Indominous Rex on the Glass Ball. The sound effect was also great. Some of the soundtrack where also from the original and that made it better. Even though the cast didn't have big names it really worked. Chris Pratt the employee/trainer was amazing he singlehandedly made the film better by making it funny and exciting. Bryce Dallas Howard was also great she made the movie better by adding the funny/serious type. She started as the serious only work type person but in the end she changed and became a family type and she started to loosen up. The movie has everything it has comedy, romance, action, thriller, and even violence. It also teaches important values like how important family and it is wrong to play God and greed is very bad and can punish you in a really bad way.One of the parts that disturbed me a lot in the movie is where Zara, Claire's assistant, chased the brothers even though there is chaos, danger and Pterodactyls everywhere to protect them. She was later got passed around by Pterodactyls like chew toy dropped in the fish tank and drowned then eaten by the underwater monster the Mosasaur. All I was thinking about is what did she did to deserve such a terrible and brutal death? She had a worse death than the villain/bad guy, Hoskins.I liked the big fight scene where the Indominus Rex went face to face with the Tyrannosaurus Rex. It was like the original versus the genetically modified beast. It gave me the shivers just seeing the T-Rex come out and facing the Indominus Rex. The only part that I didn't understand is the T-Rex working with the Velociraptor to defeat the Indominus. I think it just didn't really make sense since that they would work together since in the other movies the T-Rex was just destroying everything it sees which makes a lot more sense than working together with the Velociraptor. Overall the movie was great. It is an action-packed comedy filled movie with a great story line.",Jurassic World
1498,joshua-61208,Well at least the writing was bulletproof... like a slice of swiss cheese that is.,1,1 November 2015,"Is this the standard we're giving these days? 7.2? Stop giving them money so they have to actually make decent movies to get their millions of dollars.I don't know where to start with this over-hyped pile of menagerie... so.. characters I guessCharacters - Owen: Overall the best all rounded character, although very far-fetched.. I won't ask what his pea shooter was supposed to do to dinosaurs. The relationship between him and Claire never should have escalated, if anything a mutual respect would have been better. But a kiss in the middle of all the death and destruction? Claire: Terrible, bad life choices. How long has she been running this park? What was with the unrealistic expectations that she be giving a guided tour to her nephews? Clearly doesn't care for human life.Masrani: Contributed nothing to the film but to state the bloody obvious. 2 days away from his pilots license and he can't perform a take off. I felt this was one of the main characters in the film just there to babysit the poor audience.Hoskins: Probably the only consistent character in the whole damn film. Better acting than anyone else in the film too.Gray: OK, second most consistent character in the film but oh so annoying.Zach: Terrible awful character. There was obviously something going on at the start between his girlfriend but why even show that if you don't explore it later on? He's a gimp on the whole trip until he sees some girls and starts communicating with his eyes, what the hell? Then all of a sudden when the plot calls for it he completely changes his mood while they're out in the useless POS gyro-pod.Lowery: Skinny Dennis Nedry. As soon as they showed him it was obvious they tried nodding to the Dennis character of the first film. His comic relief was terrible, awkward, and a robot would have been able to do what he was doing.Wu: Good to see him back for this one. He lost his morals somewhere though. Sure they order some bigger and better dino's but just for the sake of adding all the un-needed features he doesn't bother to question it at all.Karen: Holy hell why was she even in the movie? Send your kids off by themselves. Unrealistic expectations of her sister then cry on demand??? TERRIBLE!!! Plot – By far the worst aspect in the movie was the audience babysitting. Having useless characters there just to ask a question, only to have someone answer the obvious question just for the sake of the idiots watching the movie.There were probably only two good scenes in this movie and they were both in the Indominus cage. The first where it was barely seen, it set a good mood. And the second was when it was escaping obviously. It gave a decent sense of dread which carried over to the security guard getting eaten scene.FYI, they should have made this movie M and put some violence and gore in. For the sake of a PG-13 they hardly showed anything in any of the scenes. I get it you don't have to show it to make it a good movie, but it's a dinosaur movie where heaps of people die, instead of censoring it for the sake of a rating just do it right.Stupid scene 1. Those kids have a complete change of heart when they are in some sort of danger. They take their weak gyro-pod in to somewhere obviously dangerous without a care in the world and are then able to outrun a monster than no other man in the movie can. Then they think twice about jumping to save their lives? Good one.Stupid scene 2. The small army with the bug zappers that chase after the Indominus. *looks at tracking beacon* Masrani: ""what's that"" - ""It's the tracking beacon, it clawed it out"". I'm sorry but what the hell, why are you explaining everything for the 10 year old kids? Stupid scene 3. Send forth the raptor in to the woods with cameras. They are using the cameras all well and fine until the Indominus somehow communicates with the raptors first go. Within seconds the raptors understand and turn on Owen whom they've known all their lives just for the sake of switching up the plot. There is no way any animal would do that all of a sudden.They are still trying to tickle the Indominus with pellets and only one guy brought a rocket? Why wait to fire it after the Indominus runs off? Why don't multiple guys have rocket launchers? Why even put that scene at that point of the movie with those guys there? It's obvious that if they were at that stage with that many guys they should have had something remotely capable of killing it, and would have realistically used it first go. Suddenly the raptors run off and they don't use the cameras anymore, good one, terrible.Even more rubbish: Running faster than a t-rex while in high heels still. No way. I call BS on that. T-rex can run 30mph or more in the first film and every other film. Some high level BS right there.Called the final scene, I knew it would be either the big fish or t-rex that would beat the Indominus but didn't know I would be right twice over.Owen managed to get his raptors back on his side which again doesn't make sense that they can be switching so much. They either stick with what they've known all their lives or stick with what they now see as more liken to them (the Indominus).There's so much I've had to leave out. I wish I could give it 0/10. I've scratched more interesting things off the bottom of my shoes.",Jurassic World
1499,mylifesuckssg,Jurrasic world,6,11 December 2015,"No, i was wrong. First of all, it is not a bad movie but it is disappointing one. Some of the performances in it were good especially Chris Pratt. The amount of detail put into creating the theme park is very commendable. Other than that, everything else is pretty mediocre.The characters are bland and uninspired. The characters of the younger brother and the older brother were annoying as hell. There is nothing special about Pratt's character. There is a lack of character development for the myriad of side characters. The amount of subplots in this movie is more than The Room and A Madea Christmas combined.The dinosaurs looked so bland. There was no suspense. The humor was corny and unfunny. The exposition scenes were boring and could have been improved. The villain was terrible",Jurassic World

Who's bright idea was that? I doubt their insurance company knows about this.When Claire finally becomes a real person, her flat and carefully layered hair becomes full and wavy.When they release the raptors and Owen is chasing them on a motorcycle, the raptors are constantly jumping over fallen trees and rocks and ducking tree limbs but Owen has a perfectly clear path and, not only does he catch up, he ends up in the middle of them.In the last scene (think triage), Owen suddenly has a mustache and no other facial hair.They tried so hard to copy the iconic moments from the first movie (2 raptors vs the tyrannosaur, using a flare to lure the tyrannosaur) but it just comes off as an unimaginative rehash.Here's the biggest one: real velociraptors were really only two or three feet tall. People have been bringing this up since the first Jurassic Park movie. Owen goes off on Claire for creating the I.Rex, saying it's not a dinosaur because it's modified. What does he think he's training? I gave this 3 stars because the actors played their roles well. It's a shame they didn't have much to work with.",Jurassic World

1502,skill_zombie,The irony of unrealistic things in a made up world,9,17 November 2015,"The only thing scarier than running from a Mega T-Rex is running from a mega t-rex while wearing heels. Jurassic World was so many things, but realistic wasn't one of them. Obviously there isn't a standard for a level of realness in science fiction movies, but there are standards for the real world. In a modern world full of historic dinosaurs, anything can happen. Apparently one of these things can be the possibility of keeping a pair of heels intact and on your feet throughout two hours of dinosaur madness. The main female protagonist in Jurassic World does just that, not once stopping to limp in pain or take her heels off. You don't even need to be a woman to know that the act of running from a dinosaur, (or several), in heels is quite the feat. There was also Chris Pratt riding his old motorcycle at top speed through a thick jungle, trying to escape three incredibly fast velociraptors. While making for a great scene, the thought of actually accomplishing this task frightens and perplexes me beyond words. I did hear many negative things about this movie before I went into it, however I did not let it influence my thoughts on the film. One lad from the Huffington Post says that, ""The film tickled the inner child in me that was once frightened by these same dinosaurs years before."" I completely agree with his stance, finding it hard to not compare the old movies to the new. My senses were heightened and I often caught myself forgetting to breathe. It was also very pleasing to find that they frequently threw in references to the old movies, through speech and objects themselves. Overall, even though Chris Pratt never removed his shirt (unfortunately for all the women in the audience), I have to give it a 5 out of 5 stars. Putting the unrealiticness aside, the imagery and plot line was irrefutable and attention grabbing.",Jurassic World

I stayed up until 1:16 am and I should be sleeping, but this is going to keep me up at night just thinking about all of this really. What I really liked about this, is that it creates a lot of suspense, and personally I think that those are the best kind of movies that make you want to keep watching or reading and find out what happens in the end. The most amazing that this movie did, was that it totally changed my point of view on sci-fi and how it can really move you especially when it's something that you have an interest in. I definitely recommend it to people who are into dinosaurs, action, and adventure. I can't lie about how much this movie really scared the living hell out of me, but that only means that it was that amazing and really captivated my attention into not missing a single part.

1504,blazeorange,A 21st Century Remake,4,23 December 2015,"Jurassic World is the younger, bigger, but not quite as jaw dropping sibling of Jurassic Park. With below par CGI and a regurgitated plot, Jurassic World reeked of nostalgia and reminded you how good the first one was (because this one isn't quite as good).Performances were decent by Pratt and the two children, but Howard's acting was below par and just way too cliché. The characters in this movie almost directly correspond to the characters in Jurassic Park.As for the story, plot holes permeated Jurassic World. The list of plot holes is just way too long to go into, but if you watch the movie, you will get the point.If you want to see Jurassic Park remade by computers, then watch Jurassic World.

The problem was not the dinosaurs, it was the way people behaved around them. If I was being chased by Raptors, I would not stop to make bad jokes. If I was being chased by flying dinosaurs, I would not stop and kiss the leading lady. I think that dinosaurs looking at each other and thanking each other with their eyes is pretty dumb. The lead woman out running a T-Rex in heels? Come on really? Yes, the introduction of a new dinosaur was a nice touch. But for the rest of the movie, save your time. I think Spielberg is losing his touch. He is getting too cute with his movies. I think this one should have been left alone.",Jurassic World

It isn't absolutely terrible or anything, and Chris Pratt does a highly decent job with what he has to work with, but it's still easily the worst of the four. Yes, I said it. Jurassic Park 3 is a better movie than Jurassic World. Let's just skip the fact that the special effects actually looked more realistic 20 years ago (!!!) and go straight to the meat of it...The beginning of the movie was filled with silly conversations of stereotypical character that made my brain hurt, the plot quickly developed into something far fetched and unnecessarily ridiculous, plot twists were cliché and/or even more far fetched, the ending was wrapped up with a icky-sweet and stupid moment, and last, but not least, the movie left us with some gigantic plot holes. I mean, we're talking inexcusably unresolved problems at the end of the movie, that rendered everything pretty meaningless. I'm left questioning the professional abilities of the writers and the director.What were they thinking?! As I'm writing this, The Lost World has a 6.5 rating, while Jurassic World has a 7.1 rating. That is unbelievable. No way is this a better movie than The Lost World.All in all, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. Go ahead and bring out the popcorn and drinks! Just don't expect movie history to be made. Sure, there were a couple of cool moments and some nice scenes, but nothing like in the first two, and sadly the CG stuff quite honestly make things less believable. I think the movie is mostly saved by Chris Pratt being quite badass, so there's that to look forward to.",Jurassic World

With a comparison in dinosaurs topics, the movie ""Dinosaur Island"" presented 2014 have more new upgrade of knowledge about dinosaurs, and other documentaries do so. Some documentaries present in few years ago introduced new technologies in dinosaur researches and give results that demonstration dinosaurs have feather and color skin. Scientists don't suggest any color for each piece of dinosaurs. They just have found out pigment when study on the bones. For the biggest creation Indominus Rex, the most fearsome monster in the movie, have the skull like Abelisauridae family. Study on skulls of that dinosaur family, scientist just suggest they all have very small size of brains. So, I don't understand how intelligent can it be.",Jurassic World
1509,jacob-83179,Reasons why JW is BAD.,1,25 March 2018,"The sexual politics of Jurassic World are an unfortunate 180-degree turn from the original movie. Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing is a flat, limited depiction of a career woman who has apparently rid herself of all human emotion for the chance to excel at her job.She's a rigid, unsympathetic character until she finds her maternal instinct, which she's obviously buried underneath all that career ambition.The funny, lovable Chris Pratt also gets reduced to a swaggering, sweaty mess who communicates better with dinosaurs than he does humans.It's a stupid, retrograde disservice not just to the audience, but to the legacy of the original Jurassic Park, which, 22 years ago, gave men and women equal footing against humanity's real enemy, dinosaurs.I'll fully buy into the fact that Jurassic World exists in a future where we've grown bored by dinosaurs and where Burt Macklin communicates with velociraptors, but I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to believe any woman would trek through the jungle with those stupid, silly shoes still on her feet without breaking her ankle, foot or neck.One other large failing of the film is it's inability to provide a believable bond between the two brothers, Zach and Gary Mitchell. The kids are cute, but for much of the movie it feels like older brother Zach isn't just disinterested in his younger sibling, but might actively hate him. Plus, his constant leering at teenage girls is super creepy.Zach might come around at the end, but it shouldn't take almost getting mauled by a giant prehistoric monster to show some brotherly affection.Jurassic World is built upon the idiocy of the masses (the general public is swarming to a dinosaur park once again after two major catastrophes and another incident that required a military rescue in Jurassic Park III, really?), but there is rarely a scene in the film that doesn't require an extreme suspension of disbelief.Zach and Gray can fix a Jeep that hasn't moved for decades because they remembered the time they fixed up Grandpa's old Malibu? Claire knows how to operate an assault rifle, and can also outrun a T-Rex?Even the villains' motivations are shallow at best. You're telling me that Dr. Henry Wu (played by B.D. Wong), the lead scientist at a dinosaur theme park who has the power and freedom to literally play God with prehistoric animals, would actually put all of that in jeopardy by making a shady deal with Hoskins, who intends to sell dinosaurs to the military? Sure!Jurassic World is a series of very cool dinosaur rampage scenes and mind-numbing filler that sets up the next dinosaur rampage scene. The action itself is jaw-dropping at times, but the story itself has no substance.Lowery, the nerdy lovelorn underling who is the true star of the movie, jokes about the park selling out to sponsors and suggests that they introduce the ""Pepsisaurus"" or the ""Tostitodon"" to the public, but the hilarious line was sandwiched between Zach showing off his Beats By Dre while riding in a Mercedes and Claire using her Samsung phone. I realize the original Jurassic Park featured quite a few Jeeps, but Jurassic World is completely over the top.Dr. Ian Malcolm said it best in 1993: ""You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had - you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now you're selling it.""",Jurassic World

It's good to see Steven Spielberg dinosaurs back on the big screen, but seeing Chris Pratt on a motorcycle and having a relationship with vicious Velociraptor was head scratching for me. It's a awesome movie hands down but lacks the excitement that I came to love with the first film. That being said, the Indominus Rex has to be the best dinosaurs in the trilogy.

The dinosaur scenes such as the Indominus Rex, the raptors, the pteradons, the Trex and especially the Mosasaurus. The movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone even if they are not a fan of Jurassic World. I think that maybe more dinosaurs should have challenged the Indominus Rex but he beats them all. The plot line is great, but I think that the two children should have been able to save Zara. Despite that the movie was still amazing. The final battle kept me on the edge of my seat and the heroics of the Velociraptors were sick.

1512,siasi,Oh dear Spielberg.. where are you!,2,29 April 2016,"I knew it was going to be less compared to the originals (yes Im a fan of all 3 Jurassic Park movies) since Spielberg is absent, but this one was way too bad. ""Bubblegum movie"", you chew it and spit it out - not a classic.All i remember from the movie is Starbucks, Pandora, Mercedes, and i hate at least the first 2. These movies of the new age care more about marketing than the movie itself, the plot, the characters etc. As many one star reviews already pointed out, this movie lacked in every department. Many useless scenes and things that don't make sense. And if you have to feature a pretty redhead in heels and a sexy guy to make it interesting, your game is weak. As a redhead myself her copper hair was the most interesting thing in the movie. BUT everything felt incomplete even the romance added. I told my mother who wanted to see it ""you wont be scared at all, you wont hold your breath, no suspense"". ""Action"" seems to start very early in the movie but randomly and every scene gets watered down and the movie is in a hurry to go back to nerdy good old normal. Actors are too cold, too apathetic esp the ones in the computers room. Seems like they were forced to add some mild drama moments for old times' sake. Fast paced, no mystery, no anticipation, no fear, no escalation; so flat, ""safe"" and predictable - with scattered random mediocre short action scenes(for an impressive trailer), and the main focus is always the well lit view of the various brands they advertised. Technology at your feet but 0 inspiration. From a gadget addicted generation to the gadget addicted young viewers (the boy trying to make the other one get off his phone) - if you grew up in the 90s you know what i mean. They dare to threaten us with a sequel. If you held your breath with the raptors in the kitchen room and the jello trembling, and if you felt like the one being chased, then you demand something more!!

This will make you jump, feel like you're there with them, excited, and maybe scream. When a dinosaur is chasing after them you will be screaming for them to run faster. So if you like action movies this movie is for you.It took place at Jurassic World where the old Jurassic Park Island was. The main characters are Aunt Claire, Owen, Zach, and Gray. Also the raptors, T-Rex, and the Indominus Rex were too. I think the actors/actresses did good for their part it seemed like they weren't in a movie and it was a real life situation. Also it seemed like they enjoyed acting for this movie and were actually interested in the movie. What i liked about this movie is that it was action packed and I was really interested in it and it got me thinking what if it was real. There was also science involved like how they created the dinosaurs, the technology, and more. I liked when the T Rex, raptors, and the mosasaur teamed up to take down the indominus rex that was probably my favorite scene. I learned that you should not make a dinosaur that you know is going to destroy everything and be way stronger than the other dinosaurs and will kill them all. The moral of the story is do not make a monster. I think others will learn that they should not have dangerous dinosaurs when there is people in danger. The group of people that would like this movie is people who like sci fi and action movies. I would recommend it to people who like action and sci fi movies and ages from six and above that age. The MPAA rating of this movie I would give it is a PG. My final word on the film is that it is great. I would give this movie a 5 out of 5 .",Jurassic World

I give them all A+.My favorite part of the whole movie was when the two dinosaurs fought. My least favorite part is when some of the dinosaurs were found dead.I think the theme of the whole was to be yourself and don't change for nobody else and follow directions.I think some mature kids would like this movie.I would recommend this movie to people who like sy-fy stuff and non-fictional movies.I would not recommend to kids/people who are not mature.and people who don't like Syfy .

1518,x-95318,Jurassic world is about hybrids of dinosaurs that end up getting loose and getting tracked down by the military and their trainers,8,19 September 2017,"Jurassic World ReviewThis movie is called Jurassic world and i will be doing a movie review on it. First is movie takes place on an island known as Jurassic world. On this island they create hybrids of dinosaurs and use them for entertainment purposes. This movie is about hybrid dinosaurs that escape out of containment and the trainers and military try to track it down. Second, this movie was good all around but, it could be a little more realistic. Claire was running in heels almost 100 percent of the movie. Even though she was running in heels i think the moral of this story is to never give up and think smart because they would not have been in that situation if they were not fooled by the claw marks on the wall.Finally, i think a lot of people would like this movie depending on what movies they like. Most of the movie was good except some scenes were not as realistic as the others. I don't mean the scenes about dinosaurs i'm talking about when Grace would sprint in high heels on rough terrain like forests or rocks by a waterfall. This is more of an action type of movie. It is rated PG 13. I would probably rate this movie 8 out of 10 if you asked me.In conclusion, a lot of people would like this movie. But it does depend on what type of movie they like. If they like action like movies then they would like this movie. But if they like comedy or anything like that they would not enjoy it as much.

My opinion on the movie was it was a good story and I liked the movie in all.It took place on the old Jurassic park island were the explorers found the dinosaurs. They rebuilt a huge technological theme park and they named it Jurassic World. The main characters were Owen played by Chris Pratt; Aunt Claire played by Dallas Howard; Gray played by Ty Simpkins, and Zach played by Nick Robinson. It was a luxury theme park that provided a habitat of array of genetically engineered dinosaurs. Until the intelligent Indominus Rex escapes and sets off a chain reaction that causes other dinosaurs to go amok.What I liked was the story line, and how the scientific genetic dinosaurs were put together. There was really nothing I learned about this movie but their was nothing I disliked about the movie. I feel scientist should not try to bring back animals from the prehistoric time set.I think people who like action movies would enjoy and watch this movie. I would recommend it to my family and friends. The MPAA rating on this movie is PG13. My final score on the movie, that it was a good movie and I would give it four in a half stars out of five.

1520,mayawallace,Jurassic World,8,19 September 2017,"My personal opinion on Jurassic World I think that it is a good movie depending if you are into adventure or dinosaur movies if that makes since. I am not a fan of the dinosaur genre but it was good i think that the movie could've been shorter because people will not watch the whole thing if it is boring but with jurassic world it is not so i was able to watch. There was always a twist or turn and the movie had my eyes peeled. The characters are a big part of the story not only you wouldn't have movie without them but the way that the actors become the characters their own it is amazing. The Jurassic World luxury resort provides a habitat for an array of genetically engineered dinosaurs. Massive creature escapes,etc. Thought this movie it not just about the dinosaurs but it's about how the Owen,Claire,Zack,and Grey handled everything so there is an impact on the movie.There are the mechanical silicon type dinosaurs that they have located off the coast of Costa Rica and then the dinosaurs go lose and some die ad some go out of control. So Owen is like the dinosaur keeper or some sort and he takes care of the animals and make sure that they are in the clear. Claire invited her nephews that she doesn't really know because she feels bad. Being curious kids Zack and Grey go on this weird looking into the future rolly car and go on an adventure and other things happen from there. My personal favorite character was Claire because at first she was like ew and then she came out of her shell. I liked the movie but i did have a moment where it was gonna everywhere and i didn't know what was going on but eventually it smoothed itself out. I liked how they made the movie fictional and also funny. I didn't like how they made the movie out to be too much and didn't make it more adventurous they focused solely on the dinosaurs there is nothing wrong with that but they could have done better and expanded the base of the movie.People that would like this movie more are like scientist and nerds who like dinosaurs. I would recommend this movie to people who don't like action/adventure movies because this is a good movie to recommend so that they can go out of their comfort zone. I honestly give this movie 4 of 5 stars cause i liked i don't get me wrong but i do believe it could be better. This was my personal view on Jurassic World.",Jurassic World

I would recommend this to somebody who likes Dinosaurs,Chris Pratt, Colin Trevorrow(Star Wars),Action, Adventure,Sci-Fi and is a big fan of Jurassic Park.The special effects were stunning.This movie was definitely Action- Packed.Jurassic World is the 4th highest-grossing film of all time and Jurassic Park 24th highest-grossing film of all time. Brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gary (Ty Simpkins) go to this island to go see their aunt Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard),who happens to be the park's manager,Since Claire is a busy woman she assigns her assistant Zara (Katie McGrath)to escort them through the island but eventually ditch her. While exploring the island by themselves they get on a ride and enter a restricted area.The Indominus Rex comes and destroys their sphere but, their manage to escape.They go to this shack what use to be the Jurassic Park visitor center and repair this old jeep. While the boys are driving the car Claire and Owen ( Chris Pratt), a trainer and raptor expert helps Claire find the boys. Hoskins(Vincent D'Onofrio)( enemy of Jurassic World) wants to use Owen's dinosaurs and the Indominus Rex as military weapons. All the Actors and Actresses did a really good job.When my mom watched the movie she said that Claire doesn't get dirty with her dress but, I don't know what she means she gets messy.I just don't know how she survive that with heels the whole time?!I noticed something that I bet a lot of people didn't notice wouldn't notice. Claire calls Grey, Ty (the actor's real name)when they get off the truck. I also noticed that when Claire and Owen hide from the I. Rex Owen leaves his rifle by the truck , the dinosaur shakes the truck and his rifle is there unmoved. Claire picks up Zach's broken phone before that Zach put his phone in his pocket. Why is Claire's hair color always changing? This movie taught me not to mess with Mother Nature and don't control nature. Animals shouldn't be used as military weapons. Teamwork and bravery are also used.I would recommend this to somebody who likes Dinosaurs,Chris Pratt, Colin Trevorrow(Star Wars),Action, Adventure,Sci-Fi and a big fan of Jurassic Park. I would not recommend this to people who like horror, Western(although i don't know if thats still a thing) romance,comedy or princessy girls.

1524,a-39362,Jurassic World,10,19 September 2017,"I recently saw the fictional movie, Jurassic World. In my opinion, the movie was very interesting and got me more attracted to dinosaurs. It was a very action packed movie and had a pinch of romance towards the end. Of course, the movie is about prehistoric animals, but this is different. Scientists have created a new, genetic hybrid that is very intelligent, very... strategic. This got me very attracted to different genetics and how they work. The story takes place on the fictional, Isla Nublar, in Central America. This movie takes place 22 years after the old theme park, Jurassic Park. The main characters are Grey, Zach, Claire, Owen, and Barry. I feel like all of the actors and actresses did a good job playing their role. The story is about ancient dinosaurs that were resurrected and brought back to our generation. Scientists create a whole new and intelligent dinosaur in this movie. What I liked about the movie is that there were dinosaurs, and it had a very smooth animation for them. I didn't like that the new genetic hybrid was so mean and dangerous. I learned that everything is not what it seems. The genetic hybrid seems to be a normal and slightly dangerous dinosaur in the beginning, but towards the middle of the story, it shows what it really is. I feel like others will learn that things are easier said than done. It's not easy to kill a dinosaur, after all. People that are looking for action and adventure should really watch this movie. People in those kinds of groups most likely will enjoy this movie, so I really recommend it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who dislike blood and action. This movie is rated PG-13, so it's best for younger viewers not to watch. This movie is really amazing! I rate it an A+ for it's awesomeness.",Jurassic World

Its talks about dinosaurs and the genetics ability and what they are able to do and how strong they are .The best aspects of ""Jurassic World,"" in which a hybrid super-predator runs amok in the trouble-plagued theme park, are so good that they transport you that exhilarating mental space where the series' original director, steven spielberg, raised a tentpole back in 1993. The worst aspects are bad indeed: thin characterizations, a blase attitude toward human-on- animal violence and a weird male-supremacist streak that comes close to sneering at unmarried career women who don't have kids.Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional Central American island of Isla nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where a theme park populated with cloned dinosaurs has operated for ten years.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady, a Navy veteran, and a raptor expert and trainer at Jurassic World.Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing, the in this movie about genetic dinosaurs and what dinosaurs can do and how strong dinosaurs are.

The story is about how dinosaurs act in real life like the Raptors hunt and kill things. The Indominus T-Rex eats a lot of thing like other dinosaurs,plants,buildings,and people. I think that Chris Pratt:Owen did a good job in the movie because he did a good job with the dinosaurs and working with the people. I think that Katie McGrath:Zara didn't do a good job because the had her talking on the phone and she never payed attention to things.

1529,n-31868,Jurassic World,8,19 September 2017,"Everyone remembers the story where dinosaurs use to exist. Perhaps you have heard/Seen the movie ""Jurassic Park"" or the new one ""Jurassic World"". This story is about a group of scientists who made ""Jurassic World"" and they genetically created a modified Dinosaur killing intelligent machine! That manages to break free and camouflage to hide from the scientists and then eat them. So the scientist's and a boy named Grey are on a trip with his brother Zach to Jurassic World but didn't know there was a outbreak.So basically the whole start of the story is Zachary ""Zach"" Mitchell is a teenage boy who was present for the incident at Jurassic World, with his younger brother, Gray. He is the older son of Karen and Scott, as well as the older nephew of Claire Dearing, the Park Operations Manager of Jurassic World.Gray Mitchell is the younger brother of Zach, as well as the son of Karen and Scott and the nephew of Claire Dearing. Jurassic World took place at A marvelous place called Jurassic Park it took place in 1990 Claire Dearing is the park operations manager of Jurassic World, the younger sister of Karen Mitchell, the sister-in-law of Scott Mitchell and the aunt of Zach and Gray. Owen Grady is a dinosaur researcher employed by Jurassic World, and one of two main protagonists in Jurassic World, the other being Claire Dearing. He conducts a behavioral research on Velociraptors. Personally In my opinion Owen was a really good actor in Jurassic World and so Was Aunt Claire Gray did a pretty good job too it was intense in the movie and Zach was always the Hero in the movie, For example he jump started the Truck. The stuff I liked about Jurassic World was it was intense and dangerous and I felt sad and maybe I cried when the raptor part but you won't see me cry unless i'm really hurt. But the character I hated the most was Dr. Hoskins he is evil. The lesson I learned from this movie is don't mess with nature and or modify it otherwise we are all dead. I think others will learn not to trust their Aunt because Aunt Claire messed up she almost killed everyone with just a stupid modified dinosaur.The group of people I think would like this movie are adventure seekers maybe kids 8 Or 9 and adults but otherwise it's pretty intense and I would not",Jurassic World

We focus on the storyline of Claire, Owen, and her two nephews Zach and Gray as they fight for survival,battle against dinosaurs and deal with the evil Hoskins The movie was absolutely amazing in my opinion. It had a bit of comedy, some thrill, action, and mainly(of course) scifi! I'm pretty sure for anyone that grew up on watching the original ""Jurassic Parks"" was hit with a wave of nostalgia watching ""Jurassic World"" and were probably even hit with more nostalgia with the little easter eggs from the movie.If you're a thrill seeker, into sci fi, enjoy action, or really love dinosaurs then I highly suggest going to see ""Jurassic World"". The pg-13 rating might be a bummer for some parents that were excited to go take their little ones to go see it but I think you should still go take kids to see it, there's only a tad bit of profanity and some gore every now and then.

For my own opinion ChrisPratt Bryce Dallas Howeard Tysimpkins Gray and Nick Robinson did the best and the ones I really didn't like was Irrfaninnam and Hoskins.

What I really didn't like about this movie was that some characters didn't listen but they also learned that they were supposed to listen . For my own opinion the people that would like this movie would have to be people that like stuff back then and also like DNA stuff or just Dinosaurs. For the other people that does not like Dinosaurs or science they will still love this movie because I really don't like all the DNA stuff or science movies but I really loved this movie a lot THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING and had a lot of action MY RATE on this movie would have to me a 10/10,Jurassic World

1534,g-40095,Jurassic World,9,19 September 2017,"""Does This Dino Make Jurassic World Look Big?!""Stop, listen, and watch! You've probably seen a billion dinosaur movies and probably tired of them. Maybe one movie based on dinosaurs got your attention. The movie that caught your attention was probably ""Jurassic World"". I mean let's face it this movie has everything from action to romance! ""Jurassic World"" is an action romance movie with a science twist. Hello and welcome to the somewhat tragic yet exciting movie review!Let's start off with the basic things about this movie. After seeing this movie i'm thinking where is this place it's beautiful! Jurassic World is located at a fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, and takes place 22 years after Jurassic Park. Claire, Owen, and Hoskins are 3 of the main characters. Zach and Gray are what I call secondary main characters. Their role in the movie is what causes a chain event that affects the story line of the movie. In the movie a ginormous man- made dinosaur gets loose and terrorizes the whole place. The ""Indominus Rex"" is a man eating dinosaur that the main characters try to stop. I thought all actors/ actresses did a great job showing fear and concern. Next we will be talking about the good and bad parts of the movie. My favorite scene from the movie was when they thought the dinosaur escaped. When Owen noticed claw marks on the wall he went with 2 other people to investigate only to find the dinosaur was in the cage with them! Owen escapes but the other 2 workers were not so lucky. As Owen escapes the Indominus Rex escapes with him leading on to the next scene. My least favorite scene was when Hoskins uses the raptors to try to defeat the Indominus Rex. As he takes over the company, he lets out the raptors resulting to many people dead. One lesson I learned from this movie is to always have a backup plan. When the first plan of containing the dinosaur didn't work they somehow always had another plan. A moral somebody might take from this movie might be to be optimistic because if no one was optimistic enough the dinosaur might've done much more than injure people.This movie overall would be great for anyone to watch. Although if you think dinosaurs, science, romance, and action is a waste of time then this movie isn't really for you, is it? I would recommend this movie to people that are into a little bit of some genres. Romance, action, nature, and science will perfectly describe what genres this movie is. If you into that I totally recommend ""Jurassic World"" to you! Of course every movie has an age rating, ""Jurassic World"" is rated PG- 13. It does have some foul language but overall I give this movie 9 out of 10 non squashed tomatoes ;)!",Jurassic World

I think the cast did really well on the movie. The only person that i don't think did well was Claire because it was unrealistic because she was running with heels on. Some of the things i liked about Jurassic world was the ending. And some of things i didn't like was when Owen and the police officers went into the dinosaur's cage because it is stupid to do that and when the police officers where tring to hide they hid behind the cars instead of under them. One thing i learned was to not to run away from your aunt or who ever is watching you because they could've gotten killed or hurt. And i don't know what others could've learned from this. \I would recommend it to sifi fans and people who love dinosaurs. I would recommend it to dinosaur lovers. I wouldn't recommend it to people who don't like dinosaurs. The rating is p-13. I think it is a good movie but not the best and out of 5 stars i give it a 3.50.",Jurassic World

Its pretty boring movie, but the flaws are not the kind of Jurassic World...I had to stop re-watching this movie after an first hour, because of stupid screen writing. First ~40mins are ok and the plot isnt that bad, but nowadays hollywood destroyes almoust every possible good movie with constant action and cgi. Heres only couple of things before i had to stop: 
1: People try and can teach raptors to obey. Idiotic. 
2: Security strategy is beyond stupid. There would be no way in hell a random security guy could just open a gate from indominus rex cage that easily. 
3. Indominus Rex is too smart. Removes implants and whatever, blaa blaa. Maybe it could write a better script? 
4. Stupid people and kids acting stupid. Please not this anymore?! 
5. Everything goes wrong at the right time. Like cellphone rings but you cant hear warnings. 
6. Lets go and get raptors to fight against indominus rex!I cant understand people who have rated this movie 10 or 9. This movie is a mockery to first one. Good dinosaur movie doesnt need constant action showing as much as possible cgi. I truly hope the next one this summer isnt bad as this, but after seeing the trailer and comments i know im going to be dissapointed AGAIN. I hope people would stop watching these all CGI-dont care script-movies. If i had a kid, i would show him the first one (maybe second and third) but not this.",Jurassic World

1542,sebastianxlr,No banner,1,28 April 2018,I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that there was no banner fall during the end scene like in the first Jurrassic Park. I am a banner enthusiast and only enjoy movies that employ the use of a good banner scene.,Jurassic World
1543,Chowdder,Felt like a movie meant to sell merchandises,4,26 June 2015,"I walked out of the movie quite angry and disappointed. The central issue I have with the movie is how the story felt like it was written by multiple writers rather than a central plot.The original Jurassic Park was a story about man vs nature, a story about survival and humility. I found it quite interesting to watch John Hammond as he changed from a cavalier dream builder who triumphed over natural forces to a person who realized his limitations. He came to understand that his pursuit of his dream meant he was putting those whom he loves and cares about in the line of fire. His eventual humility and realization concluded with a very memorable scene of him flying away from the helicopter. It left you with a sense of ""leave nature as it is"".Jurassic world on the other hand attempted to emulate this central plot at many points in the movie. At one point I almost felt like it had potential to be a thought provoking movie, when BD Wong was confronted and asked about how the concept of Jurassic Park was always unnatural. However it soon fell back into the explosions, cheesy 1 liners, and the numerous subplots that weren't completely realized. Off the top of my head, there was one about brotherhood and how a looming divorce is affecting them, the romance between Chris and Bryce, the lifestyle choice of Bryce to postpone starting a family, the militarization of nature, the typical awkwardness of computer geeks, the reining supremacy of T-rex, and it goes on and on. It's seriously ridiculous that most of these subplots were just briefly mentioned and never returned to again.I did enjoy the overall VFX, but there are a lot of be desired as it doesn't look believable. Everything looks to pristine and clean. Every glass looked like it was all freshly polished, no smudges or dirt. Felt like the movie had an over abundance of blue tint that is meant to make it look sci-fi. The goal is to make the concept of an amusement park believable and I didn't get that feeling.Overall, I'm terribly disappointed at the movie. Even the ending scene felt like it was needlessly inserted not by choice but rather by a focus group. I come to appreciate that Jurassic Park is now a franchise, and sadly it's predictable that this movie was likely produced to help sell merchandises not to be an intelligent movie classic.",Jurassic World
