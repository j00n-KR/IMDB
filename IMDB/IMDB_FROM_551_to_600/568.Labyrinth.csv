0,TheLittleSongbird,"Combining music, adventure, comedy and fantasy, this film is a timeless childhood classic!",10,24 January 2010,"I just want to start by saying I loved this movie as a child. As a matter of fact, I loved a lot of Jim Henson's work, having grown up on the Muppet movies and of course on The Dark Crystal. At 17, I still love this film, it is a timeless childhood classic for the whole family to enjoy! Then again, I may be biased as my favourite film genres are musicals, animation and fantasy. Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Little Nemo's Adventures in Slumberland, Mary Poppins, The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St Louis, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Princess Bride and NeverEnding Story were my favourites, and I know one or two reviews here have been disfavourable towards Legend, and that has got a lot of hate on IMDb. But I want to say despite Legend's flaws, it is a visual feast to the eyes, with a great music score and one of the best villains ever in a fantasy film.Back to Labyrinth, it may have one or two minor flaws. People have complained it is cheesy and dated, and that the ballroom scene slowed things down. Maybe so, but this film is so entertaining and such fun and the ballroom scene was exquisite visually I honestly don't really care.Labyrinth, I think has held up well. The puppet characters are fantastically designed and move seamlessly, and the film is filled with widely imaginative sets that are both haunting and enchanting. The film began and ended very effectively I thought, and the special effects are well above average. I especially love the feel of the film, it is like a Grimm's Fairytale. A lot of effort went into making this movie and it shows, the battle at the Goblin King's castle especially was a masterstroke.The story is timeless, filled with exuberance, charm, comedy and adventure. This is what a fantasy film should be like, and reasons why Wizard of Oz and NeverEnding Story work so well even on repeated viewings. The scripting is not that bad, Dungeons and Dragons especially had inane and vomit inducing dialogue that alone ruined the film. There is some good dialogue in this film though, Jareth gets the best of them. There were some funny moments here, the fiery dudes who take off their own heads were great fun, same with the cute little dog. And I like Hoggle, a gruff but somewhat humorous character. As well as the feel of the film, and the characters I love the fact that Labyrinth teaches values about growing up without preaching.I have heard complaints about the music being cheesy. Maybe I am wrong for saying this, but while it isn't the most imaginative music score ever in a fantasy film, I liked it. It has a unique sound to it, and gave David Bowie the opportunity to show off his strengths. I like David Bowie, there are songs of his I like more than others, but then again it is like that with most musicians. His songs here are fun, the lyrics are nice and the melodies are memorable. The final confrontation between him and Sarah was a definite highlight.The performances and the characters were also great. I have also heard complaints that Sarah is a vapid heroine and that Jennifer Connelly is just eye candy. Can I be one to disagree? Jennifer Connelly isn't the best actress ever, but in an early role she is not bad at all. Her character is the sort of character that goes on a journey, she starts off perhaps unlikeable, but in the end we want her to succeed. Think along the lines of Princess Lilli from Legend. The best piece of casting is David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, there may be those who may laugh at his Tina Turner- like wig, but Bowie plays a unique sort of villain. Nothing too sinister or camp, but one that is evil but also charismatic, manipulative, sympathetic and sexy. Bowie played all these qualities flawlessly, as he was ever so sexy, his voice was in great shape and some of his costumes are to die for. And the voice acting is very well done, I noticed some Muppet regulars there, including Brian Henson as Hoggle. Plus Toby Froud as baby Toby is absolutely adorable.All in all, I love this film and will cherish it for years to come, no matter how many minor flaws there are. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Labyrinth
1,Leofwine_draca,Strictly for kids,4,14 August 2016,"Jim Henson's fairy tale adventure is definitely one for the kids only as I found when watching this appallingly childish production. Packed with inferior effects, cheesily dated music from David Bowie and some of the tackiest '80s fashions you'll ever see, this is by far a product of the period in which it was made and one which is difficult to take seriously otherwise - unless you're the same age as the annoyingly cutesy baby which makes its appearance here. Toddlers are guaranteed to have a wonderful time with the song and dance routines, the colourful sets and scenery and the variety of weird puppets that pop up along the journey but this is one for the under fives only.The problems? Well, a total lack of plot for one doesn't help, with Jennifer Connelly and her baby brother suddenly being transported to an alternate reality for no apparent reason when she makes a wish. You never really know what's going on or why, only that Connelly must rescue her sibling. It's just an excuse for lots of dodgy adventures involving stinking bogs, a extremely disturbing dwarf-man known only as Hoggle, and a monster that tries to be Chewbacca from STAR WARS and fails miserably in the charisma stakes.The lead is taken by Jennifer Connelly, who proves to be more annoying here than in her debut outing, PHENOMENA. David Bowie struts his stuff in a cheap wig as the Goblin King, who does things like walk upside down on ceilings but proves to be a disappointment when its revealed that he has no power to actually hurt Connelly and co. after all. As for the puppets, well they're mainly played for laughs and are reminiscent of FRAGGLE ROCK and nothing else. All of the usual suspects are here under the makeup - Frank Oz, Warwick Davis, Kenny Baker - but they play generic caricatures and are of little interest. As for the labyrinth itself and the numerous dangers and wacky situations that our heroine encounters, from talking walls to moving stones to creepy witches, again kids will enjoy but adults may find their attention wandering. Unlike something like STAR WARS or HARRY POTTER which can be enjoyed by kids of all ages, LABYRINTH is a childish production so if you're over five years of age, give it a miss.",Labyrinth
2,SnoopyStyle,Lovely Jennifer Connelly in fun Jim Henson adventure,8,28 December 2014,"Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is left home alone by her parents to babysit her little brother Toby. She can't stand her stepmother and she hates her crying baby brother. She makes a wish to the Goblin King (David Bowie) to take Toby away. ""I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now."" She begs for Toby's return. The Goblin King transport her to the Labyrinth. If she solves the Labyrinth in 13 hours, he will return Toby or else Toby will be turned into a goblin forever. At the entrance of the Labyrinth, she meets grumpy dwarf Hoggle who kills faeries.Jennifer Connelly is lovely and she calls Hoggle Hogwart. Jim Henson brings his various puppets and visual styles to work in an imaginative and sometimes dark creation. It is a fun adventure with some light charm and also a good coming-of-age story.",Labyrinth
3,claudio_carvalho,Another Magic Film from the 80's,8,1 December 2016,"The teenager Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is forced by her father and her stepmother to babysit her baby brother Toby while they are outside home. Toby does not stop crying and Sarah wishes that her brother be taken by the Goblin King. Out of the blue, Toby stops crying and when Sarah looks for him in the cradle, she learns that he wish was granted and the Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie) has taken him to his castle in the Goblin City in the middle of a labyrinth. Sarah repents an asks Jareth to give Toby back; but the Goblin King tells that she has to rescue her brother before midnight, otherwise Toby will be turned into a goblin. Soon Sarah teams up with the coward goblin Hoggle, the beast Ludo and the knight Didymus and his dog Ambrosius in her journey. Will they rescue Toby in time?""Labyrinth"" is another magic film from the 80's, maybe the best decade in cinema history. It is amazing the quantity of wonderful films produced in this period and ""Labyrinth"" is no exception. This film makes the viewer feel good and the plot is a journey to the childhood of any adult. It is also delightful to see David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly and these puppets again. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Labirinto - A Magia do Tempo"" (""Labyrinth – The Magic of the Time"")",Labyrinth
4,gavin6942,One of the Three Best Films of My Childhood,8,8 October 2009,"Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) must babysit her little brother (technically, half-brother) when she would much rather recite fantasy lines in the park. After wishing that he would be abducted by goblins, he is -- in fact -- abducted by goblins! Now she must rescue her brother before her parents get home.Growing up in the 1980s, this was one of my three favorite childhood films, alongside ""Princess Bride"" and ""Adventures in Babysitting"". It is just a great family film, one that kids will love and adults will, too. That's a hard thing to capture, something I do not see much anymore, outside of Pixar films.Jennifer Connelly shines, not surprisingly, and David Bowie is the perfect casting choice for a villain -- he can sing, and he has that exotic look about him. (I hear other considerations were Sting and Michael Jackson, but that wouldn't have been the same.) The songs are incredible, and the directing and puppets of Jim Henson are timeless.I recently had the privilege of showing this movie to a few people who had not seen it before, and one who who had (and enjoyed singing along). While it is a childhood memory of mine, there is no reason it cannot become a new memory of yours or a childhood memory for your kids. Just a great film.Of all the great things that came from this film (Connelly, and Toby Froud's production company, to name a couple), one that might be overlooked is Kevin Clash. If you know the name, you know him as Elmo, arguably the most popular Muppet of all time. But before he was Elmo, he worked with Jim Henson on this film... coming into the business in your 20s alongside Henson and Frank Oz must have been the greatest treat.",Labyrinth
5,jboothmillard,Labyrinth,5,12 September 2005,"Directed by Muppets creator and Kermit the Frog actor Jim Henson, produced by George Lucas, and written by Terry Jones, I remember seeing maybe once or twice when I was much younger, but I knew if I was going to get a better opinion I would have to see it again in my older age. Basically fifteen year old Sarah (A Beautiful Mind's Jennifer Connelly) is rehearsing lines for a play she is appearing in, called Labyrinth, and she continues doing this when she gets home, and she is put in charge of looking after her baby half-brother Toby (Toby Froud). She notices her treasured teddy bear Lancelot has been taken, obviously Toby has the toy, and he is crying so much that she is becoming increasingly angry, to the point when she is following the storyline in Labyrinth, whereby the girl wishes the Goblin King will take him away. She hears that he has stopped crying, and she is shocked to see he has disappeared, she has inadvertently summoned the real King of Goblins, Jareth (David Bowie, also writing the music and songs), and he is giving her a seemingly impossible task to get her brother back. Sarah must travel through the long labyrinth maze of the fantasy world he inhabits, and she has only thirteen hours, otherwise Toby will stay with him, as a goblin, forever. The walls and pathways of the maze change frequently, and the puzzles and tests along the way are just as hard to work out, and the only assistance she has seems to be from grouchy goblin dwarf Hoggle (voiced by Brian Henson), gentle beast Ludo (Ron Mueck), and fox-like knight Sir Didymus (puppeteered by Dave Goelz, voiced by David Shaughnessy). While she is travelling through the maze, Jareth is having fun antagonising her, playing with the child, and trying to trick her into forgetting about her brother all together to give her whatever she wants from her dreams. Eventually, even after two hours are taken away, she makes it to the end of the Labyrinth, and even though Jareth offers to be her slave, give her everything and make all her dreams come true, she remembers the key line at the end of the story, saying the words ""You have no power over me!"" In the end Jareth is forced to turn into an owl and fly away, baby Toby is returned home, and Sarah wishes that her new friends Hoggle, Ludo and Sir Didymus, as well as many other friendly creatures, would stay with her. Also starring Shelley Thompson as Stepmother, Christopher Malcolm as Father, Natalie Finland as Fairy, puppeteer Frank Oz and the voice of Michael Hordern as The Wiseman, puppeteers Steve Whitmore and Kevin Clash and the voice of Percy Edwards as Ambrosius, Kenny Baker as Goblin Corps and Warwick Davis as Goblin Corps. Bowie gives a reasonably nasty and certainly musical performance as the villain, although you will be giggling at how camp he is and his Tina Turner style hair, and young Connelly does alright as the girl going on the long journey, obviously the puppet character made by the Muppet creators are all cute, cuddly, ugly and disgusting, it is very cheesy and might not be to grown up tastes, but children will be enthralled by this fun fantasy adventure. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Worth watching!",Labyrinth
6,ma-cortes,Marvelous tale in which Jennifer Connelly must resolve the Goblin King's Labyrinth in 13 hours or else Toby will become a goblin.,7,17 February 2013,"Enjoyable fantasy in which a teen girl needs to find her baby brother and goes into a fantastic world , a land beyond imagination . It deals with 15-year-old Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) accidentally wishes her baby half-brother , Toby (Toby Froud) away to the Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie) who will keep Toby if Sarah does not complete his Labyrinth in 13 hours. As she enters into labyrinth where everything seems possible and nothing is what it seems. Sarah has to rescue him before midnight, or the baby will became a goblin.Fantastic fairy tale about a girl who dives into a wonderous fantasy world through a labyrinth , in which to be showed a fabulous sense of wonder , imagination , astonishment and amazement . This is a gorgeous story specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible . This wonderful flick is an enjoyable tale with great charm from a screenplay by Terry Jones , being based on a story by Dennis Lee and the same filmmaker Jim Henson , trying to incorporate too much dreamland with fantastic beings like Goblins , dwarfs , fairies , giant monsters , among others weird and bizarre creatures . They have been made by means of puppets and no by computer generator effects but at the time hadn't been invented . As the Ludo rig originally weighed over 100 pounds, but was brought down to just over 75 pounds, as it was becoming too difficult for the actor/puppeteer inside the suit. However , the owl in the title sequence is computer generated , the first attempt at a photo-realistic CGI animal character in a feature film . The visual beauty of the impressive scenarios give the movie a real sense of wonder and surprise . Breathtaking production design and sets are visually rousing and appealing . And a spectacular ""Dance Magic"" scene consisted of over 48 puppets, 52 puppeteers, and 8 people in goblin costumes . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Alex Thomson . Imaginative and sensitive musical score by Trevor Jones ; including various agreeable songs by the great David Bowie . The movie was stunningly directed by Jim Henson , early deceased at 53 years old , though was his final feature film , however, being continued his work by his son Brian Henson . Jim established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio and as he directed the successful ""The Muppet Show"" (1976) , it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made The Muppets movie(1979), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie . The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy Dark Crystal (1982), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work . The most successful TV work in the 1980s was ""Fraggle Rock"" (1983), that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects . When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant ""The story teller"" (1988) series respectively attest to and , of course , this ¨Labyrinth¨.",Labyrinth
7,BA_Harrison,Great family fantasy fun. Tra la laaa!!!,8,8 December 2007,"Many years ago, I remember seeing Jennifer Connelly on TV (I think it was on Blue Peter), talking about the making of her new fantasy film, Labyrinth. I was instantly smitten by the gorgeous brunette and made a point of seeing the film at the cinema when it came out. Although my primary reason for going was to gaze at the stunning actress for a full 100 minutes or so, I also found myself enjoying the film on less libidinous levels.Jim Henson (of The Muppets fame) delivers a dark fairy tale laden with messages that will resonate more with the viewer the older they get. For children, Labyrinth is simply a visually arresting and magical tale with wonderfully imaginative characters. Older viewers, however, will pick up on several strong themes within the story: responsibility, the importance of imagination, sacrifice, and the difficult journey from childhood to adulthood.Sarah (Connelly) is a teenager who lives her life with her head in the clouds, spending her days dreaming of faraway lands and magical worlds. When her father and stepmother leave her to look after her baby stepbrother, she selfishly wishes for the screaming toddler be taken away by Jareth the Goblin King (David Bowie). Her wish is granted: Jareth whisks the kid off to his castle, leaving a stunned Sarah only 13 hours to try and get him back (after which, the boy becomes a goblin!).Sarah sets off on a rescue mission, finding her way through the complex labyrinth that surrounds the castle, meeting new friends on the way, learning a few valuable lessons about life, and growing up a bit in the process.With some wonderfully inventive sets (think Dali crossed with Escher), loads of memorable characters, and a few catchy songs, Labyrinth is enormously entertaining. Bowie is great as Jareth, who chews up the scenery whilst wearing a ridiculous costume (which includes package enhancing tights and a silly wig), stopping occasionally to perform a tune or two. He also manages to say the words 'Tra la la' with a straight facebravo, Mr. Bowie!And Connelly... well, let's just say that I find her difficult to fault.The fantastical characters that inhabit the domain of the goblin king are a fun mixture of Henson puppetry and animatronics, which are only let down by the occasional visible wire or spot of bad 'matting' (particularly noticeable when Sarah meets The Fireyscreatures that can remove their own body parts).Towards the end of the film, the pace does lull a tad (I find the sequence in the goblin town rather overlong and unfunny), but, on the whole, Labyrinth is a terrific family movie that stands up well to repeat viewings.Which means I can watch young Jen time and time again without worrying too much about getting bored. Hurrah!",Labyrinth
8,moonspinner55,"""Get me out of here...""",4,11 March 2017,"While babysitting her bawling stepbrother on a stormy night, a mercurial, dramatic teenage girl selfishly wishes the crying infant away...and is quickly amazed to discover he has indeed been kidnapped by the Goblin King, who gives the girl 13 hours to work her way through the maze surrounding his castle in order to save the child. Possibly a reworking of ""Alice in Wonderland"" (with a Brothers Grimm design), the film--featuring song numbers, Muppet creations and an amused David Bowie as the somewhat-lascivious King--certainly has striking moments, yet the picture doesn't utilize its time well, and impatience eventually settles in. Young Jennifer Connelly has the central role, an impossible task to place upon an unseasoned actress; she has grace and poise, but she's forced to repeat lines, ask endless questions, and run from nonsensical creature to creature with the same look of confusion on her face. This package, executive produced by George Lucas and directed by Muppets creator Jim Henson, is burdened with hundreds of yapping, grotesque characters, ""Raiders""-like cliffhanger episodes and a masquerade ball/David Bowie music video, when all it really needs is a heart (and maybe some clever dialogue). ** from ****",Labyrinth
9,paul_haakonsen,What kind of magic spell to use?...,9,9 June 2018,"""Labyrinth"" is a timeless classic, and it is definitely a movie that you never get tired of watching. I have been enjoying ""Labyrinth"" many times since my teenage years, and I still enjoy it even today.What works so well in the movie, is a myriad of things with the most obvious being the puppets of course, as Jim Henson did a tremendous job with the detail and the creation of these creatures. And the creativity is just astounding.But it is also the storyline that makes the movie so enjoyable and watchable again and again. This is a very classic tale of good versus evil, and one where innocence and youth prevails, despite facing overwhelming odds.Let's not forget the acting and the voice acting, which definitely was spot on, and brought so much character to the movie.And also the songs and dancing. Yeah, there is an abundance of that in the movie. But it works out beautifully, especially because these songs are so well-written and performed, and they very much add to the movie and capture the essence of the fantasy genre. And let's just be honest, these are songs that we all can sing along to.If you enjoy a good fantasy story and haven't seen ""Labyrinth"" already, then it is highly recommended that you take the time to do so. This is definitely one the most outstanding roles for the late David Bowie, and it was also the movie that started my love for Jennifer Connelly's acting talent.I just recently introduced my 8 year old son to ""Labyrinth"" and he was instantly spellbound, loving every moment of it. And he was also very much impressed (if not fascinated) with the puppets and their variety.",Labyrinth
10,Quinoa1984,"not as successfully fantastical as the other Henson films, but it is an entertaining KID's flick",7,15 May 2006,"Watching Labyrinth on TV the other day, after years of having not seen it, I'm reminded in general how I see Jim Henson's work, via the usual Muppets (in the 'Muppet' movies) or in the non-traditional ones (the spectacular film 'the Dark Crystal'), just a smidgen different than as a kid. For one thing, there's the nostalgia factor, of having loved the muppets as a kid and seeing how the entertainment value is still there, if on a slightly different wavelength then as a kid- some jokes more received and understood and some moments not as freakish as when back in the day. But with Labyrinth I just thought, despite all of the talent and marvelous special effects, ""this hasn't really changed much for me since I was a kid, it's still just, well, good."" The story itself- of young Jennifer Connelly going after her baby brother kidnapped by the Goblin King (David Bowie, in full-on regalia) while navigating through the tangential directions of the Labyrinth with help (or not) from creatures- is just a fairy tale for kids. That it's got some clever direction from Henson is not without its merits and some scenes get the fantasy feeling right, even for its time and visual FX limitations. But if there are limitations anywhere noticeable it's in the script by Terry Jones, from the story by Henson and Dennis Lin, where chances to reach to a larger audience (like with the Dark Crystal, which works for adults just as well as for kids) are missed. The humor in the film does work here and there, but there are also the Bowie songs to contend with which are, more or less, rather disappointing and, well, 80's in retrospect. I still liked the inventive uses with the supporting Muppet-type characters, the little troupe of sorts that follows Connelly's character till the end (almost). However, having seen it again, I'm not sure when I would want to watch it again, unless I had some kids around. In short, one of the lesser Henson films (ironically the only one produced by George Lucas) which means that it still has enough visual prowess and imagination to top the current films reaching for its target audience.",Labyrinth
11,Hey_Sweden,"Lives up to the word ""magical"".",8,11 January 2016,"A lovely and engaging Jennifer Connelly stars in this fantasy-adventure populated almost exclusively by puppet characters. She plays Sarah, a selfish teenager. Obliged to babysit her infant brother Toby (Toby Froud, the real life son of the films' creature and costume designer Brian Froud), she ""wishes that the Goblins would take him away"". And the Goblins are happy to grant this wish. She must then journey into a world of strange characters including Jareth (pop star David Bowie), the Goblin King. Working against a deadline, she navigates the title location in the company of characters like the somewhat weaselly Hoggle, the valiant Didymus, and a giant named Ludo.Conceived by Dennis Lee and the late, great Jim Henson (who also directed), and scripted by Monty Pythons' Terry Jones, ""Labyrinth"" is a good, solid diversion. Sarah and her cohorts must solve various problems and overcome obstacles, and all of this is done with pizazz and a refreshing amount of humour. (The door knockers are particularly funny.) Shot in widescreen by Alex Thomson, it shows some real imagination. When our heroes come perilously close to falling into something called The Bog of Eternal Stench, we can sort of get a sense of how bad it must smell; the visuals really help in this regard. The finale is action packed, and there's little here - save, perhaps, for the antics of those head removing members of The Fire Gang - that would freak out the youngest and most sensitive of viewers.Bowie is charismatic as the villain, and he also gets to perform in some musical numbers for which he wrote the songs. Many of Hensons' talented associates - Frank Oz, Brian Henson, Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Kevin Clash, etc. - perform their roles with verve. Diminutive but brave Didymus would have to be this viewers' personal favourite.With so much of today's family films revolving around computer animation, it's necessary that we introduce our kids to more classic forms of entertainment such as this.Eight out of 10.",Labyrinth
12,grantss,"Good, but a bit uneven",7,11 March 2016,"Good, but a bit disappointing. Cast and crew read like a who's who: directed by Jim Henson (of The Muppets fame), written by Terry Jones (of Monty Python), produced by George Lucas, starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connolly, music by David Bowie. Decent enough fantasy-drama, but plot is a bit random. Has some periods where it just drifts. The use of musical interludes just seemed out of place, and like padding.Good special effects and use of puppets, as you would expect from Jim Henson.

16,evanston_dad,"When Everything Is Arbitrary, the Story is Boring",4,25 December 2014,"Every once in a while I'll read a critic's review of a movie that perfectly articulates something I was thinking but wasn't as adept at putting into words. I was reading Roger Ebert's original review of ""Labyrinth,"" Jim Henson's cult classic fantasy film that starred a very young Jennifer Connelly and a very bewigged David Bowie. He didn't like it much, and his reasons for not liking it were exactly mine. The film takes place in an Alice in Wonderland world where anything can happen, anything does, and everything is arbitrary. The problem when trying to craft a compelling narrative set in such a world is that when everything is arbitrary, then nothing much matters. As a viewer, you pretty much stop caring what's going on, because there's no fluidity of story, no central arc to keep you engaged. ""Labyrinth"" plays out as one episodic set piece after another. You're never quite sure how each one is going to resolve itself, but you know it is going to resolve itself and usually in some random way that feels more like lazy than clever storytelling. Jennifer Connelly is quite terrible, actually, not displaying any of the acting ability she would later, while David Bowie is kind of fun as a goblin king who looks like Tina Turner from Thunderdome and is given a couple of musical numbers to perform so as not to waste his musical talents.Grade: C-",Labyrinth

Bowie's songs highlight and punctuate a magical film that is sure to appeal to both the young and young at heart. Better then Jim Hanson's other more mature film of the 80's ""The Dark Crystal"", because it's a tad more humane and more easily to relate to, but both these films are fun to watch.

19,Aaron1375,It has freaking David Bowie in it man!!!,8,2 April 2011,"This film is done by Jim Henson's team, not sure if it was the same people that did ""The Dark Crystal"" or not. All I do know is that this film was better than that film as the inclusion of actual human characters helps rather than being all puppets. The film has a girl babysitting her infant brother. The girl is a young Jennifer Connelly, however, she looks a bit old for the role. I am sure she is young in this one though as she still looks young in more recent movies. Well she soon wishes the goblin king would come and take her brother as he is a pain and soon enough the goblin king does come in the form of David Bowie! She is soon tasked with trying to navigate a labyrinth in a set amount of time or her brother will be turned into a goblin. The film is fun and it has a few musical elements to it as well. Generally I hate musicals, but the songs work here. David Bowie is perfectly cast in this one as when he sings among his goblins he looks right at home amid the puppets and he brings a very high energy to the role, suffice to say he is a rather good actor. He was also very good in this vampire film and he also did a short horror film where he did not speak but had such a presence. The maze is rather cool, though I kind of wish the movie were longer and more scenes were done within said maze. Still, has fun characters for Jennifer's character to meet, a rather good plot, a super giant cool looking door guard and a nice finale as the goblin king and Jennifer walk through a very strange set of staircases.",Labyrinth
20,The_Void,Lacklustre fairytale that could have been better considering the people involved,5,30 March 2008,"I must admit that I was never a big fan of kid's movies even when I was kid and as an adult, I'm especially not a big fan of them of them now. This of course begs the question of why did I watch this movie? Anyway, what we basically have here is a children's fantasy about a mythical goblin world, directed by Muppets creator Jim Henson and starring controversial rocker David Bowie as the 'Goblin King' as well as a young Jennifer Connelly (who was probably given the role because of her excellent turn in the Dario Argento masterpiece 'Phenomena' a year earlier) as the young heroine named Sarah. The plot begins when the young Sarah gets sick of her baby brother's crying so does what any aggravated sister would do - and wishes him off to the Goblin Kingdom. The Goblin King gets hold of her brother and keeps him in his castle, which happens to be right at the centre of said Goblin Kingdom. Naturally she decides to try and get her brother back and the rest of the film follows her in typical fairytale fashion as she makes her way through the various pitfalls.This film apparently didn't do very well upon its release and I'm not really surprised. Not least because the two leads were not well known (David Bowie not well known for acting) but also because the movie just doesn't work. Labyrinth has a lot to play with from the plot but it all feels very dingy and like the producers didn't want to stump up the money to have the film made properly. Fantasy worlds really should be colourful in kid's films, and if they're not then the plot should be dark enough to justify the tone, but what we end up with is a typically 'happy' kid's movie with plenty of singing and dancing etc in an environment that doesn't suit it. David Bowie tries to create a big of menace with his character but ends up looking silly more often, and while the heroine does face some tribulations in her efforts to get her brother back; I never really felt like she was in any danger and that it wasn't all going to turn out OK in the end. To her credit, Jennifer Connelly is the best thing about the movie and puts in a suitable performance in the lead role. Most of the characters are puppets and they all look a bit crap and I'm sure that the puppeteers could have managed something a bit more impressive. Overall, this is a rather lacklustre fantasy with not much to recommend it for; but it is better than the crappy 'Legend' at least.",Labyrinth
21,Mr-Fusion,A marvel of creativity,7,25 February 2019,"Absence of Muppets aside, this is probably the most Jim Henson movie ever made. On more than one occasion, it feels like the Creature Shop was running wild, coming up with all manner of strangeness just to put in the film. The creativity is never more apparent than during the Shaft of Hands scene; only a gaggle of puppeteers could've pulled that off. Man, it must've been a lot of fun working on this movie!This is only one reason Labyrinth excels (and lives on past the '80s). The teen angst is real, the songs are great, the lines are funny . . . and then there's David Bowie. The Goblin King brought to life. Bowie struts around the sets with godlike command, at home not only in the role but also the songs, and he offers one hell of a performance. He's exceptional here.I haven't seen this since I was a teenager, and it holds up very well. It pleases me greatly that the worm has sort of become a staple in my house. We all love doing the accent. ""Don't go that way! Nevah go that way! *sigh* Shoulda kept on goin' down that way, she'da gone straight to the castle.""Not to mention Ludo. ""Smell baaad!""",Labyrinth
22,siderite,Good for its audience: small children,5,9 June 2005,"The movie is a fairytale, starting from a rather unrealistic premise that a big sister wants her baby brother be taken away while she is reversing for a play and, voilà!, the kid is taken away. She then goes through a magic world reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland to find the child before , oh no, it turns into a goblin.The Goblin King is David Bowie, who can't help borrow class to everything he does. He sings a little, dances a little, he is mischievous and funny at the same time. Without him, this movie would have been really boring, even for a child.There isn't much else to be said about this. It is a movie produced to be consumed, with music hip in the year the film was made, puppet animation reminding of the Muppets and all characters acting like they are on drugs. But hey, it's a fairytale! It even has a few fairies in the beginning. If you are a parent and you want to teach your children about compassion and love of their siblings, let them watch this movie.",Labyrinth
23,StevePulaski,The film that caters to that piece of childhood of which many of us refuse to let go,8,1 March 2016,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Lauren Shumaker for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" Jim Henson's imaginative scope of Labyrinth is what carries the film and saves it from becoming a listless display of decorations without any kind of creative spark. A film like this could easily be done in a soulless manner, basically having puppet characters going through the motions alongside flat human counterparts without any sense of joy. With Henson's production company at the helm, Labyrinth becomes a lot of fun; an adventure that winds up frequently sucking you into its bizarre world and only letting you break free for a few moments at a time.Until it decides to let you loose (or hit a slower patch), Labyrinth keeps you invested in its maze of a world, evoking mystery, enigmatic characters, and solid performances with a strong sense of stylistic flair. The film revolves around Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), a fifteen-year-old girl who must navigate a confusing, visually deceiving labyrinth in order to get to the kingdom of Jareth, the Goblin King (David Bowie) to rescue Toby, the infant she's babysitting. Her wish for Toby to be taken by Jareth, a character in a play for which she's rehearsing, after he wouldn't stop incessantly crying comes true, and now she must get to Jareth's kingdom in thirteen hours or less before Toby is turned into a goblin.Labyrinth is one of those films that was destined to find its audience in due time. Burdened by minimal advertising and middling box office performance during its original, 1986 theatrical release (likely because of the story not being a known franchise or existing property), the film has resurfaced enough of a cult following that the idea of a sequel is being tossed around. Films like these are strange little marvels because they're exactly the kind of films that remain timeless in a narrative sense, even with dated special effects and costumes that screamed the respective time period. No matter what decade we're currently in, pop singer David Bowie's performance here is still loud and outrageous, and regardless of the respective era, Henson's puppets and characters are just as entertaining as they ever were.And no matter what age we are, for most of us, Henson's creations still inspire the kind of wonder they did when we saw shows like Sesame Street at a tender age. The eccentricities and the larger-than-life characteristics of the puppet characters make for such an engaging experience that, as stated before, their world becomes ours, and by the end, we're almost sad to leave the world we've been entranced in for well over an hour. We have Hoggle, Sarah's most loyal companion throughout the labyrinth who sometimes gives her helpful hints, but really acts as cleverly incorporated moral support, Sir Didymus, a fox knight tasked with the difficult challenge of being brave, and Ludo, a beast with a large heart. The power of Henson's creation is strong in Labyrinth, so much so that screenwriter Terry Jones doesn't skimp out on the human characters and leave the puppets to do the work; we also get a fascinating villain at the story's core and a charming narrative structure that builds as we navigate the nonlinear land of the maze.Stylistically potent and narratively charming, Labyrinth caters to that whimsical part of your brain devoted to clinging to every ounce of childhood you have left in a way that emphasizes all that you love and miss rather than exploiting it for cheap sentiment. It's an admirable feature in a somewhat forgotten film that is finally getting the respect it deserves in the modern day.Starring: Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie. Directed by: Jim Henson.",Labyrinth
24,blanbrn,Child fantasy film of magic and escape.,6,19 September 2021,"Never watched ""Labyrinth"" as a kid finally did though and I must say it does not hold up as some of Jim Henson's best works nothing in comparison to the ""Muppets"". The creatures and fairy tale like feel is okay just the writing does not have any subplots or twist as the story is straight forward. As it involves a teen girl Sarah who's bored and feels out of place with her stepmom so as while babysitting her younger brother her world takes on a new magical twist and journey. I guess for some they may feel a little ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""Snow White"" parody as Sarah on her journey must face the evil and wicked Goblin Jareth King(singer David Bowie). And time plays a theme in the film as she is given only 13 hours to solve the dangerous puzzle and game of labyrinth. The sets and effects I guess were good for it's day and time of 1986 as this has became somewhat of a cult fantasy classic that perhaps today's generation of kids will discover and like.",Labyrinth
25,MovieAddict2016,Very good fantasy film. Very much under rated!,9,19 August 2002,"The problem LABYRINTH had was the timing in which it opened. People just weren't into fantasy as much back then. I guarantee if this film had been released this or last year, it would've been a big hit. Films like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings did so well, that people would have been open to accept other fantasy films like LABYRINTH.  LABYRINTH has loveable and very creative characters, good acting (Jennifer Connelly has now won an oscar for A Beautiful Mind BTW), very original looks to it, and is just plain filled with imagination and fun. Kudos to George Lucas and Jim Henson productions for this aspect of the film.

26,lasttimeisaw,Bizarre but utterly arresting!,7,8 April 2015,"LABYRINTH is Jim Benson's follow-up of the grotesquely eye-opening puppet enterprise THE DARK CRYSTAL (1982, 7/10), and also his final painstaking work, where he pairs a cherubic Jennifer Connelly and a trend-setting David Bowie (look at his 80s coiffure!) as human actors with all his accomplished puppets, to present a spellbinding fairytale in a labyrinth at the heart of a Goblin kingdom. It was a disastrous commercial failure upon its release, but time has been pretty generous to it and now it has achieved the cult status and even a possible sequel has been hatched for many years. As bedazzling as Bowie plays the almighty Jareth the Goblin king, this is no prince and princess romance considering Connelly's Sarah is only a 15-year-old, after her embittered wish accidental becomes true, Sarah faces a daunting task and must solve the labyrinth within 13 hours, otherwise her little stepbrother Toby (Froud) who has been snatched by Jareth and his underlings, will become a goblin forever. Not as otherworldly as THE DARK CRYSTAL, but again Benson and his prop teams let their imagination soar with no boundaries, there are biting fairies, countless helping hands, the paradoxical door riddle, a juggernaut cleaner, talking walls, head-detached creatures called Fierys, the bog of eternal stench, junk-yard hags, behemoth metallic guards just to name a few. Plus, the picture distinguishes itself as a prototype of computer-generated CGI technology, For Sarah, it is also a journey of learning not to take things for granted, don't be as spoiled and selfish as she is in the beginning, and making friends alongside, soon she will be accompanied by the cowardly dwarf Hoggle, the giant beast-looking Ludo, who is actually very timid and can summon rocks, and a chivalrous fox named Sir Didymus. All is granted with vivid impersonations thanks to the excellent puppeteers behind them. One innate shortcoming of puppets-operation is the lack of fluidity in motion, especially during the large-scale actions, that's why the film slackens a bit in its second half when Sarah's squad grows, and during the castle-raiding scenes, it becomes rather distractive. But as luck would have it, a final highlight arrives in a gravity-defying stairwell resembles M.C. Escher's RELATIVITY, where Sarah faces off Jareth alone and rebuffs his conquest, her mission finally has been accomplished and Jareth is defeated and morphs into the form of an owl. Bowie contributed five songs to the soundtrack, the most striking one is AS THE WORLD FALLS DOWN, played in a critical scenery where Sarah's memory is fading and she appears as a princess in a masquerade, captivated by Jareth's gaze and supposedly should forget about her mission and capitulate to Jareth's glamour. Connelly is peachy and sufficiently engaging as a little heroine acquires wisdom and compassion in this phantasm fable, as the film cunningly suggests with all the paraphernalia in her bedroom of a girl obsessed with a fanciful wonderland. I could imagine if I had watched it when I was a kid, this movie could have been stuck in my memory as an all-time classic, and I doubt the current cinematic puppetry can ever reach the same altitude of ingeniousness and virtuosity.",Labyrinth
27,Rainey-Dawn,A-Maze-ing Film,9,25 October 2014,"This is a fun fantasy film - quite enjoyable to watch. I was 14 when the movie came out and I enjoyed it then and still enjoy it now. This is the type of film that kids and adults alike can love.To describe this film I would say it is ""The Dark Crystal"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland"" meets ""Snow White"" meets ""Cinderella"" meets ""The Neverending Story"". Labyrinth is just as good as all the films I have mentioned.David Bowie is absolutely perfect for the role of Jareth the Goblin King - wonderful performance by Bowie and his songs for this film are quite good.I loved the character Hoggle - he's quite an interesting little guy. Ludo is so lovable (he's nothing like Chewbacca yet he reminds me of the Wookie lol). Sir Didymus is just cool and somehow puts me in mind of Fizzgig from The Dark Crystal. Sarah is so much like Alice (in Wonderland) lost in a bizarrely magical surreal world.The only thing I really found wrong with the film was the finale - it ended quite abruptly for me - and I think it should have tied up the loose ends with Sarah's parents and baby brother.

David Bowie playing the goblin king in a Jim Henson movie? That had to be worth watching.It was, although I probably would have enjoyed it more when I was 12. For one thing, when I was 12 I wouldn't have minded Jennifer Connolly's high-school-play caliber of acting, nor the general quality of cheap kids movie that peaks out from time to time.While at times the movie feels as shoddy as a student film, at other times it shows flashes of incredible genius and imagination. But more than anything else, this movie is just really weird. Bowie is an odd choice to write songs for a children's movie, the story floats somewhere between fantasy and meta-fantasy and there is some traditional kid's movie moralizing mixed in with things you don't usually see taught in kid's films (like, life is unfair, so sometimes you have to be unfair too).I can't say this is a great movie, but I would certainly consider it well worth watching.",Labyrinth

Nope. He didn't.And, speaking about the atrocious-looking fright-wig that Bowie wore - That, to me, was nothing but a source of ""fly-away-hair"" annoyance. It really was.And, on top of that - Labyrinth's decidedly overlong running time of 100 minutes certainly played against its story being able to hold my full attention throughout its entire duration.Anyway - Yes.

On her journey she meets some strange and mischievous creatures that help her out or try to stop her.Well, this is the first I've seen it in over a decade or so well, actually it's first time in a while, that I sat down and watched it fully. This is warm and tremendously fun film for kids and adults, though you could say it's fairly cheesy nowadays. In all, it doesn't ruin the charm and fun of this puppet production.This is a weird, enchanting, sometimes dark and very magical fairytale film by director Jim Hanson and producer George Lucas. Hanson captures the very endearing, the bizarre, and the artful and quite colourful dreamlike world of The Goblin King perfectly. While, the script is witty and very poetic in its many puzzles. Though, you would expect that, as it's written by Terry Jones of Monty Python fame.Great puppet designs by Jim Henson, that is truly delightful in their many different personalities and distinguishing traits. From a dwarf, goblins, a fox and his sheep dog, a hairy beast, talking door knockers and rolling and farting rocks. Some of the creatures are a sight to see and are fairly likable and hardly annoying. Henson's creations are just a marvel to look at. Not forgetting the Labyrinth and Goblin Castle that he created is simply astonishing in detail and character.The soundtrack is another distinguishing element of the film, other than the puppets and the labyrinth. Though, one or two of the songs are a little too self-indulgent and slows down the story a bit, but the music soundtrack mostly comes across as pretty hypnotic and mystical. Well, most of the songs.The performances are outstanding and come across as quite natural. Jennifer Connelly is gorgeously sweet as the teenager Sarah, while David Bowie fits his role perfectly. He has a spell-bounding aurora as the manipulative and charismatic Goblin King. Though, his clothing style isn't a sight to see. I'm glad that he got the role ahead of Michael Jackson. As well he sings all the songs in the film.What we got here is a simple fantasy film that has a lot of heart and a mature moral to the story.

32,Cineanalyst,Kiddie Escapism,4,17 January 2020,"I see why people like ""Labyrinth."" There's nothing especially awful about it; everything in the production from the puppets and animatronic creatures to the musical interludes is pleasant enough (although the green-screen effects for one scene are primitive), but I also see why it initially flopped. It's too blandly simplistic for me to appreciate it. The fairy-tale genre is a rich one. There are Lewis Carroll's Alice books, from which ""Labyrinth"" alludes to by falling down rabbit holes, and this story's girl also breaks through the looking glass at one point. Although not as sophisticated as children's literature, adapted, ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) is rightfully beloved as a fantasy film. In ""Labyrinth,"" too, the girl meets friends along her path to the fairy land's mastermind humbug hidden behind the gates. This King of the Goblins employs crystal balls like the Wizard of Oz and the Wicked Witch of the West did. He also employs poisoned fruit à la Hollywood's first popular fairy tale, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Yet, overall, it doesn't work as well here.I suppose successful fairy tales are ""taken for granted."" Labyrinth walls covered in glitter, David Bowie strutting about with a bulge, and a stink swamp comprised of excreting sphincters constantly farting doesn't hold the same wonder or brilliance of scenes from Baum, Carroll and Grimm or the aforementioned masterpieces of Disney and MGM. In a sense, ""Labyrinth"" is a garbage dump of fairytale conglomeration. Even the slight fourth-wall breaking with Bowie looking at the camera while singing and Jennifer Connolly reading her lines in the opening, from a book of the same title as the film, doesn't add much. Neither does the most compelling reading of the film I've come across, such as in Josh Larsen's review, of the protagonist's fondness for fairy tales being a retreat from her burgeoning sexuality, as attacked by Bowie's pop-star signaling of sexual reproduction--what with the baby snatching and crotch display. It lacks the intricate layers indicative of a labyrinth.",Labyrinth
33,ericstevenson,I expect nothing less from Jim Henson,8,25 January 2017,"I've heard about this movie a lot and it's great to finally be able to see such a cult classic. I do feel bad about not seeing it sooner seeing as how David Bowie died last year and all. I really wasn't that familiar with his music, but did know a lot about this movie. What else can you say about two of the most famous creators of all time, Jim Henson and George Lucas collaborating to make a movie? Oh, and their products would both eventually be owned by Disney. Probably the best thing about this film is how amazing the visuals are. There is much creativity put into these backgrounds and puppets.I will admit that the scenes with the blue screen aren't done that well. The story's a little silly, but it's still great to look at. I don't know how a lot of this stuff happens. Why do all these rocks suddenly appear and attack the guards? It's certainly awesome to see. The final battle scene is very well done with great ideas and lots of fun action everywhere. I love how David Bowie himself just keeps popping in and out of the movie.

The highlight of the film is, without a doubt, all the beautiful creations made by Jim Henson and his incredible creatures workshop. Credit is certainly due to all the amazing characters and sets that are showcased here. The story itself, on the other hand, is not as impressive, there's really nothing compelling about it. We follow a young girl named Sarah struggling to solve a labyrinth to save her baby brother. The plot is very back and fourth, as well as frustrating at times. The characters are not likable, we are never given a reason to support Sarah, or even for us to actually want her to succeed in her quest, while David Bowie is certainly charismatic as the Goblin King, it's difficult to find him likable as a result of his motives. While its flawed, Labyrinth is a beautiful film, sadly the kind that would not be made today, I would recommend it as a family film as long as your children are not too sensitive.

37,CuriosityKilledShawn,Not as good as dark crystal.,6,6 May 2004,"Coming a couple of years after the far more accomplished Dark Crystal this is relatively straight-forward but still a helluva lot more imaginative than any family movie of recent years. You could call it a modern fairy tale, but it's just not deep enough. And for a film called Labyrinth, it's strangely uncomplicated.Jennifer Connelly (younger and prettier, though her acting is questionable) stars as Sarah, a teenager who bizarrely doesn't have a boyfriend and ends up living in her own fantasy world. Her dad and stepmother go out, leaving her to babysit her baby brother. Annoyed with his crying she utters a magical spell, wishing the goblins to take him away. Sure as sugar, the Goblin King himself (Tina Turner, oh sorry...I mean David Bowie) turns up and takes away the screaming tot.In order to get him back she must solve 'The Labyrinth' (cue dramatic music) and reach the Goblin King's Castle within 13 hours. Along the way she meets new friends (of the Jim Henson variety) in the form of Hoggle the dwarf, big, hairy and cuddly Ludo and cute little fox Sir Didymus. It's pleasant enough entertainment but there are some serious problems.The most serious of them all is David Bowie's attire. Most specifically, his trousers, they are a little revealing in the crotch department to make an understatement. You'll cringe, you'll avert your eyes, yet you'll be mesmerized. Come on, how could this have been allowed in a family movie. Plus, Trevor Jones' score is disappointingly unmagical and the filmmakers have given in to the urge to have David Bowie crank out some dreadfully 80's tunes that stagger the action and hold up the plot.It's a shame to call Labyrinth nostalgic. But if it were made today it would be full of hollow CGI. There's something charming in practical effects and puppetry (or is that Muppetry?) that no computer graphic can generate. The photography and is stunning and it captures landscape and fantasy perfectly. And all those cute Jim Henson characters are far more interesting than any Hobbit.Filmed in Panavision, the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture looks good. But not exceptionally so. Columbia are so hyped up over their Superbit releases. And that's fine when considering newer movies. But for a film like Labyrinth we really should have a brand new, hi-def remastering. THAT would have looked super. What we have however is just a good-looking movie. There's hardly any grain, no dirt (surprising considering the age of the print) and perfect colors.Originally recorded in Dolby Stereo, the first DVD release was in 2.0 surround only. For this Superbit release Columbia have given us a full 5.1 track in Dolby Digital and DTS. How does it sound? Like 2.0 surround. There is hardly any deep bass. It's front speaker biased, with little or no surround use and there's practically no difference between the Dolby or DTS tracks. We could have been given a full 6.1 track with stronger remastering of the original sound elements. How cool would that be?
As this is a Superbit, there are no extras. The original DVD release had an hour long documentary on it. But this Superbit is only slightly better in quality, so it's up to you to decide which one you want. Also, there is a Collector's Edition which includes this version plus loads more.",Labyrinth

On one occasion, when the baby wouldn't stop crying, she wished out-loud for goblins to take him away, so she can finally have some peace. But she couldn't imagine that this would really happen. Now she has just thirteen hours left before her brother is forever turned into a goblin, and in front of her there is a huge magic labyrinth, in the center of which is the castle where the Goblin King holds her baby brother.The film was directed by Jim Henson, who is also the author of the original story. This fairy-tale adventure for children in many ways reminiscent of the more famous ""Wizard of Oz,"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""The Neverending Story"" and, if I remember correctly, I would say that from them even borrows certain characters and situations. A large number of actresses auditioned for the lead, and Jennifer Connelly won it. She certainly is a much better choice than Sarah Jessica Parker or Laura Dern, but also unfathomable to me because Helena Bonham Carter and Marisa Tomei also were in competition. Goblin King is portrayed by David Bowie, who is also the author and performer of all the songs in the film. When I first watched this movie, as a kid in the late eighties, at the same time I was fascinated and terrified, and for years after that Bowie was creeping me out. And just one more interesting trivia - an owl from the very beginning of the film is the first attempt of a realistic CGI animal in a feature film.7,5/10",Labyrinth
40,The-Sarkologist,Bowie and Muppets - magnificent,9,19 March 2018,"What was interesting about this film is that I was forever comparing it with A Neverending Story, and one of the things that I didn't like about the Neverending Story was that while that had some rather interesting characters in Fantasia, the entire story was focused around a single person (or actually two), and pretty much everybody else disappeared into the background. This is not the case with Labyrinth as even though we have one major character, as she treks through the maze she picks up a number of friends so that at the ends there is a rather disparate group wondering around the domain. While I should have made a note on the Atrieu's lack of companions in my review of A Neverending Story, it wasn't something that I picked up until now.
 There is so much to love about this film, and in fact it is one of those films that, despite being a creation of Jim Henson, it has attractions to both children and adults (which is another thing that makes it stand out from the previous film I watched where the main character is a 'little boy'). Well, there are still a lot of elements to the film that would relate more to children than to adults, and the major aspect would easily be the use of muppets - back in the eighties, much in the way that cartoons were generally considered to be for children, so were muppets (even though I suspect that there is a decent amount of adult humour in The Muppets, if my Dad's reactions were anything to go by).
 However, watching this film now (and having finally getting around to watching it after having it sit one a table for over a year), I suddenly realised how much I missed with this film when I was younger. Okay, I wasn't a huge Bowie fan back then, so having him as the major character did put me off, that is until I came to appreciate his skill as a singer, and an actor (though he doesn't make all that many appearances in film). The thing that struck me the most about this film is how enigmatic Bowie actually is, and even though he is the villain, he has an appeal that not many villainous characters actually have. Moreso, he has a way in which he won't necessarily send his minions to do his dirty work, but rather appear himself to deliver a message directly.
 Then there is Jim Henson's muppets - they have a nature that not many other fantasy and science-fiction shows replicate. Well, there is Star Wars and Lucas' famous Cantina scenes, but Henson seems to follow this trend here were each of his muppets have something clearly unique about them. We aren't talking about a bunch of mindless clones, but rather a unique individual, even if we are in a situation were the characters are being swarmed by an army of goblins. The amount of time an energy that went into creating each of the characters in this film must have been incredible.
 The final thing I wish to touch upon is how this film would have been a fantasy roleplayer's dream. Once again I never picked it when I watched it all those years ago, but it is what I would call a classic dungeon crawl. What I mean is that we have a labyrinth full of rooms and each of these rooms have a different challenge to overcome, with the goal to reach the centre of the dungeon. This is what I would call your classic Dungeons and Dragons adventure game, full of monsters, treasures, and basically an awful lot of fun.",Labyrinth
41,sol-,Jen's Labyrinth,7,17 April 2017,"Desperate to stop her baby brother crying, a teenager hastily wishes the tyke away, only to find herself on a perilous journey to rescue him when her wish magically comes true in this fantasy adventure tale from the combined imaginations of Jim Henson and Terry Jones. In one of her earliest big screen performances, Jennifer Connelly is well cast as the young protagonist. Less successful is the casting of David Bowie as the Goblin King. He is certainly charismatic enough for the role, but never really scary or menacing, and the songs that Bowie adds to the film do little to advance the plot. The film's greatest achievement is the spectacular set design, from living, breathing door knockers to optical illusion brick walls to a finale set in a room full of Escher staircases. Some of the visual effects are pretty nifty too, though other effects look incredibly fake (light emitted from a smashed mirror; headless dancers). As for what the film means and whether or not it is all in her mind, any answers are unclear. The film mostly seems symbolic of Connelly's progression to womanhood, realising responsibilities in life and leaving childish whims behind, however, the awkward upbeat ending negates this agenda. 'Labyrinth' is a magical enough ride that the unclear purpose of the film is never really irksome throughout, though it is hard not to wonder afterwards.",Labyrinth
42,briancham1994,Oddball fantasy,6,1 July 2020,This film is squarely within the style of 80s fantasy films like The NeverEnding Story and Willow. The style is odd with all the puppets and David Bowie's gravity manipulation. I'm not sure why others might read a deeper meaning into this film though. It was good fun but nothing profound.,Labyrinth

44,leplatypus,"Yes, it's cool to be a child again (web)",10,5 November 2016,"Honestly, after the bunch of really bad movies i have seen lately, this old one was an unexpected good one that rekindles my flame ! But at first, i was reluctant to watch it : i'm not a fan of Bowie (except maybe as Philipp Jeffries), i'm not a avid fan of Henson puppets, Jennifer is among my best actresses but at sixteen, it's different and for sure, the title implies a pretty limited story (getting out)However, as verified by my First Five Minutes rule, i was wrong : right from the credit, you enter a fine good fairy tale and Jenny is totally convincing to make us believe it's for real ! Next, maybe there was not a lot of echo at its release, but now after Harry Potter, you can really feel this magic fairy world : owl, goblins, vegetable maze, Hogwarts or Hoggle, . Next, the movie is not all boring or repetitive as it's on the contrary a constant visual enchantment : it's better than a lot of Disney productions and it has sometimes the powerful vision of Terry Gilliam The special effects are maybe old but they are accurate as the puppets look human (hoggle for example is a look alike of our old french Jean d'Ormesson !). This proves that budget or CGI means nothing as you can make a classic without them. Everything is about visions, ideas and also values because the definitive success for the movie is the lack of violence ! For example, Spiderwick that plays with the same toys is shocking as the children kills goblins and stabbed their parents ! Here, we have nothing of that : it's just gray matter working to get over the problems (Jenny is much brighter than me because i still don't grasp the yes-no question)! So for sure it's about making choices that have become extinct today ! If you want me to say a bad thing about this movie, i would say indeed that the score is pretty weak as much as the Bowie songs are pretty good ! So this Labyrinth is a must see for all who likes dreams and fantastic adventures and now i can make the difference with the Ridley Scott's Legend because for a long time i thought Jenny was in this one !",Labyrinth
45,TheMovieDiorama,"Labyrinth is a magical, fantastical and damn right bonkers adventure.",7,27 February 2018,"This is what happens when you let Jim Henson make a film. His imagination runs wild and we are left with possibly the weirdest yet most creative film I've ever seen. An over imaginative teenage girl wishes her baby brother to be taken by the Goblin King from one of the books that she is reading. Bending surrealism and reality together, we join her on a quest through a labyrinth where she must find her brother before the thirteenth hour passes. There are two morals to this story. One: never recite words from a fantasy book. Two: sometimes life just isn't fair. She really should've listened to Run DMC's ""and it's like that, and that's the way it is""...would've saved us 100 minutes. Glad she didn't though, because this was incredibly enjoyable. Forget about the thin story where it just consists of one crazy scenario to the other, and put aside the weird musical numbers that just gives Bowie a chance to sing. This film was all about world building, and what a world it built! Highly creative filled with imaginative details in every corner of the maze. There are characters everywhere. Characters walking around, characters in the walls, characters on characters...literally everywhere. It just reminded me of those role playing fantasy books where you have to turn to certain pages to decide the fate of your quest. Henson's famous puppetry and animatronics does not go amiss here, it gave the film life. Plus, his directing style was rather noteworthy, particularly an illusion that is presented by having the camera at a precise angle. The production values were incredible. The labyrinth itself was full of wonder, different architectural types and interesting foliage. David Bowie was menacing as the Goblin King, wanted more screen time though. A young Jennifer Connelly somehow carried the whole narrative by herself. Impressive. The ending was a tad bit cheesy but heck, this was damn enjoyable. Would've liked a more substantiating plot. But I wanted a crazy 80's fantasy adventure, and I just got that.",Labyrinth
46,Tweetienator,Aged Well,8,19 January 2020,"In my younger years, as I watched Labyrinth for the first time, the movie was okay but I didn't enjoy it much (I liked Dark Crystal from 1982 a lot more, maybe the comparsion with that masterpiece clouded my reception of Labyrinth).
Now, a many years later, I rewatched this one on some tv channel and I was pleasantly surprised - it is really an eye-candy to see the visual design and settings against all those modern green screen/CGi fixes that mostly still look somewhat extremly steril compared to real settings.
Anyway, Labyrinth got a nice story, and David Bowie and young Connelly give us a nice trip into some weird dreamland: better than any Peter Pan movie adaption this is one more time an extremely fine work by Mr. Henson. Thumbs up - watch if you are into fantasy and fairy tales and still didn't make a trip into the labyrinth.",Labyrinth
47,matthewssilverhammer,Dat Bulge Doh,7,10 September 2016,"Nostalgia holds a magical power over people. It can warm souls, comfort sadness, project youth, and even cloud judgment. This makes films like Labyrinth particularly difficult to read critically. Much like Goonies, Henson's Labyrinth's, a mix of wry comedy and innovatively designed ideas, put a loving trance on swaths of 20-40 year olds who happened to see it at the right time. Much like many of its ilk, I'm not sure it completely deserves all the accolades it gets from its fanboys/girls. However, it's still fantastical fun, even if its storytelling urgency is less than fully engulfing. It's a film more interested in incidents than plot (girl wishes brother would leave, goblins steal brother, sister has to get brother back). In that sense, and many others, it hearkens Alice in Wonderland (my favorite Disney Animated film). It's an intensely imaginative movie that follows a bored young girl (played by Connelly with the charisma of a mannequin) as she encounters an adventure full of odd characters, winding streets, and inexplicable magic. The characters within the maze are fun and distinct, and Bowie matches the dark mystery of the story while keeping a childish wonder right below the surface. The difference between this and other kids-fantasy-adventures I REALLY love is hard to pinpoint. The design is outstanding, the humor is affable, the characters are surprising, and the scenes pop with surprise. Again, I can only assume my distance from this film during my early age keeps me at a slight distance. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable piece of 80s pop-culture that I'm shocked Tim Burton and Johnny Depp haven't ruined with a CG-covered remake. Give it time.",Labyrinth
48,insomniac_rod,A wonderful fantasy tale!,8,29 July 2005,"By today's standards ""Labyrinth"" may look dated and cheap but there's something about it that makes it special. David Bowie makes it a stand alone movie in the weird ranking. The man is crazy but his performance is excellent!Jennifer Connely (being 16 at the time) delivers a solid and tender performance. She was very, very cute and her performance totally gained the audience's love. The tale is fantastic and keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. The musical moments are also great! The f/x were great for it's time and I wonder how they came out with the idea for creating such original characters. The thing that I liked the most about the movie is it's art direction. The world that is created is taken directly from everyone's fantasy world idea. Colorful and dark at the same time.Better than the ""Neverending Story"" movies, ""Labyrinth"" should be watched for lovers of sci-fi.",Labyrinth
49,funkyfry,an unfortunate failure,4,13 December 2007,"I'd sorta love to rave about this movie, being a big fan of fantasy and faerie-tales as well as having grown up on the films and TV shows of producer Lucas, director Jim Henson and writer Terry Jones (who most people know from ""Monty Python"" and who directed or co-directed all 3 of their films). But the first thing that stops me from doing so is the fact that I saw this as a child of perhaps 11 or 12, when the film should have been very effective, and I detested it at that time. I still remember that night because my folks didn't go out all that often, but they got this movie for us and hired a babysitter who happened to be a brunette! Anyway, seeing it now I realize there's a lot of good reasons why so many people love this movie. However, there are still enough problems with the movie from my own personal perspective that I think I can understand why this is more of a cult film than a hit film.First of all, it's far too much of a ""chick flick."" The style in general is very gentle, even in the scary and violent parts. Compare the goblins to the villains in Henson's ""Dark Crystal"" or the stormtroopers in ""Star Wars."" These goblins are too cute and goofy to present even the semblance of danger that the film needs them to. Then you have the whole faux romance between Jennifer Connelly's character and the Goblin King (David Bowie). The masquerade scene is pretty good cinema, but any boy from the age of 5 to 105 is going to want to tear his hair out.Speaking of Bowie, I still remember when I first saw the movie how much I hated his music and how badly it damaged the film for me as fantasy. I know they were probably going for something like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but David Bowie is no Harold Arlen, and the overproduced technology of the song instantly dates it and removes the essential timeless element of the fantasy. If you think I'm simply engaging in wishful nostalgic sophistry, consider the fact that the producers of ""Wizard"" were wise enough to remove a silly song called ""The Jitterbug"" from the film despite having spent over $100,000 filming the scene for 3 weeks because they felt it was a bad idea to associate their fantasy movie with a 1940s dance fad that would damage its staying power. Their wisdom ensured that the film would continue to enchant audiences forever, while the short-sighted decisions of Lucas and Henson created a film that seemed dated the instant it was released, irreparably tainted by second-rate 1980s club music.Aside from the musical aspects Bowie is OK, though I never feel that he's either sexy or scary. But my girlfriend thinks he's sexy, so what do I know? Jennifer Connelly on the other hand saves the film in my opinion. It's an amazing performance given her age and the fact that she's playing opposite puppets. It's great how in the early scenes she seems uncomfortable and out of her element but seems to come into her own while in the fantasy world. She did it so flawlessly that I think some viewers (judging from the comments here) mistook it for tentative acting. I thought she really knew already how to use her eyes, always maintaining asymmetry for the sake of dynamics. Hiring Connelly was the smartest thing the producers did, and of course now that she's very well-respected it looks even smarter. She was very good a few years later in a film that Dario Argento did, but I didn't realize just how young she was when she was showing so much skill.The puppets  the big huge one was fantastic, love him  a cross between the Cowardly Lion and Snuffaluffagus. The little dog was also marvelous. Along with the talking doorknobs he reminds me the most of characters in other Terry Jones movies and sketches. The fiery dudes who take their heads off were fun too. But the main puppet was a disaster  the face was far too humanoid and I didn't care for his voice either. Honestly I know this sounds harsh but it would have been a better film if they had just hired Billy Barty. The film relies on this character very heavily and the animatronic head on a little person just didn't work for me although the effort itself and the ambition is admirable. I noticed that Henson family members worked on this puppet and I think more scrutiny should have been applied in the concept phase.Sadly, the failure of this film along with ""Dark Crystal"" and ""Fraggle Rock"" permanently scarred Jim Henson's mystique and hastened the end of the golden age of muppets. Henson himself even more sadly never go the chance to redeem his reputation as he probably could have done. I always loved the muppets and I really wanted to love this movie too  both when it came out and now  but the awful 80s Bowie music and various other elements just don't mesh together for me. This movie is interesting to watch because of Jones' writing and Connelly's acting, but the execution is off. You get the feeling that some really good concepts are just not being done in the way that would make them work, there's a disconnect between the script and the direction and I suspect that Jones' script might have been too raunchy and earthy for Henson's tastes. I kept wishing that the film had turned out better.",Labyrinth
50,southdavid,Watched again for the first time in forever..... not that long at all.,7,26 April 2018,"Another childhood classic that I decided to reappraise now I am a cynical jaded adult. For clarification purposes, I actually saw it during a limited cinema release and it didn't appear to be remastered in any way. For the uninitiated, Jennifer Connelly plays Sarah, a teenage girl who is frustrated by her infant brothers crying to the point she calls for the Goblin King (David Bowie) to take him away, which he duly obliges. To rescue her brother, Sarah has 13 hours to navigate the labyrinth and get to the Goblin Kings castle, but the maze is populated by both friends and foes and physics and logic don't always apply. Directed by the legendary Jim Henson, the puppetry work is, of course, top notch. They have a timeless quality that still rings true today. Some of the other visual effects though haven't aged quite as well, the CGI owl that bookends the film and some of the green screen work don't measure up to today's standards - though the film is now 30 years old. Plot wise, it's a little wayward - more like a collection of events rather than a story that progresses. It doesn't really earn Sarah's redemption given how horrible she is in the opening scenes. That said, some of these events are now iconic moments, mostly linked to the songs that Bowie wrote and performed for the production. These include the song and dance routine around ""Magic Dance"" and the MC Esher themed ""Within You"". Bowie is excellent throughout, funny but with a danger behind the eyes that never goes away. There's lots of humour in the film, the contribution of Terry Jones as scriptwriter is evident. Whether a younger audience will still view it as kindly, I can't say but 30 years later ""Labyrinth"" is still hugely enjoyable to someone like me, whose been watching it as long as he's been watching films at all. There you go, 300 words and no mention of David Bowie's crotch ..... damn.",Labyrinth
51,Vartiainen,"Magical, dreamlike adventure into self reflection",6,22 June 2020,"Labyrinth was directed by Jim Henson of the Muppet and The Dark Crystal fame. It was produced by George Lucas and featured David Bowie as the villain Goblin King. It's also one of Jennifer Connelly's first films. And it just might be the best live-action Alice in Wonderland film ever made.Sarah (Connelly) is a proud cloudcuckoolander, someone whose head is permanently stuck in the clouds and who can very easily lose entire days playing make-belief in the parks. And then she's given the unenviable task of looking after her baby brother while her parents go out on a date. And of course the kid gets kidnapped by goblins within fifteen minutes. Top notch job there, Sarah.To Sarah's credit, she's obviously distraught by this and does everything she can to get her brother back. Nevertheless, her character is a bit tough to get behind most of the time. You can see that her heart is in the right place, but otherwise she's a brat. Not helping the matter is Connelly's acting. It's atrocious, especially in the early scenes. As the movie progresses, she does get better, but she's not going to be winning any Oscars anytime soon. (Which is ironic because fifteen years later she did just that with her role in A Beautiful Mind.)But, putting that aside, the film is otherwise a whole lot of fun. David Bowie is an absolute blast, although the songs he's given to sing could have been better. Jim Henson's puppet work is also on full display and is easily the best part of the film. Furthermore, the story has that mad, no logic whatsoever dream quality to it, which makes it enjoyable to watch, and the characters aside from Sarah are very enjoyable.Not the best film ever made and I'd personally rather watch The Dark Crystal again, but if you've liked Henson's other films, this one is worth a watch.",Labyrinth

53,FiendishDramaturgy,Beautiful fantasy.,8,21 August 2003,"A Fantastical Quest Through the Labyrinth of Time. This Henson/Lucas production isn't quite what you'd expect from these legendary directors. Somehow, it's better.The genius of Henson and Lucas shines brightly as Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie perpetuate this wonderful tale of fantasy written by Dennis Lee and Jim Henson. Henson's son, Brian (now the head of the Henson Empire), even gets in on the act as the voice of Hoggle.The story opens in the present, this world, this plane. Sarah (Connelly) is a spoiled rotten little drama queen who thinks she is the center of the universe and the sun around which the world revolves.In a brattish fit of colossal immaturity, she stumbles upon the correct words to summon Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie) to take her little brother to the Goblin Realm.Once done; however, she realizes how angry her parents will be and decides that it's more prudent to go ""rescue"" Toby rather than allow his assimilation into the Goblin fold.Jareth gives her 13 hours in which to find her way through an impossible labyrinth, fight her way through the Goblin City, and puzzle out the staircases of the Goblin Castle and save her half-brother.She is punished for arrogance, beguiled in her naivety, confused in her indecision and imprisoned for her quick, thoughtless decisions. ""That's not FAIR!"" is one of her most used and best delivered lines; used again and again, until it FINALLY sinks in that life just isn't fair.It is a warm, funny and enriching tale, once started. It's about growing up, accepting responsibility for your actions and choices and making them more wisely in the beginning, rather than cleaning up your messes as you go along.In the end, Sarah realizes all the infantile tantrums and childish toys are nothing but detritial remains of her otherwise out-lived childhood. She begins to stumble upon the reality that the important things are family, friends, and the responsibility that comes with making mature decisions. She throws away her immaturity and child-like selfishness to save her brother and thereby sets her feet back on the right path to adulthood and maturity.It's a wonderful ""coming of age"" movie, and perfect for its target audience: girls 9-13. But I must say that children and adults alike love this movie, worldwide. It's not ONLY for girls, but for anyone who loves fantasy.

54,hellraiser7,Maze of Life,10,28 February 2020,"This is one of my favorite films of all time as well as fantasy films. I remember watching this when I was about 8 years old and it just blew me away. And I was drawn to this because of the simple fact that I'm a fan of the fantasy genre ever since I watch 80's cartoons like ""He-Man"" and ""Thundercats"" but most importantly my mom reading ""Grimm's Fairy Tales"" eventually I was bound to come toward this film.But the second thing is the fact that I've always been fascinated with mazes as they are always my favorite type of puzzle. It's hard to say why there is something about the strange twisty structure that is always interesting, as each path always takes you further toward something. But also there is something gratifying about getting through the maze, knowing it was you own instinct and intellect that took you to the center and also a feeling of empowerment as you were able to conquer one challenge you could conquer any. There is just so much to this film, much like any labyrinth ventured into from time to time, I always find something new.I really love the music in this film it's one of my favorite movie soundtracks of all time; some of the songs provided by the late great David Bowie. I never even heard of David Bowie at the time but once I did it just blew me away. The film is a bit of a musical as there are a lot of his songs incorporated but fit excellently with the film and fit its themes. From that theme ""Deep in the Underground"", the song ""Within You"" in that excellent E.C. Escher scene, But my favorite is of course ""Dance Magic Dance"" that song is just so much fun, it's the kind of song I could just dance too but also wouldn't mind playing at a party with friends. Along with another favorite which is ""Fun Dance"" with the crazy weird fire creatures which is a song that is fun, a little weird, but all the same fun and another to play at a party. But also, some of the orchestrate score from one of my favorite composers Trevor Jones, since he did ""Dark Crystal"" it was fitting he did the score for this movie.I really love the production value of the film which is just spectacular as it's all practical and there is no CGI bullcrap in sight, this whole film is just a visual feast that it would take more than one watch to gobble it all; the fantasy world looks like it could actually exist as it is just strange, dark, but all the same fascinating. The designs of the Labyrinth are just surreal beauty at its finest, obviously inspired by M.C. Escher which is awesome as he's one of my favorite artists.But of course, the puppeteering and anamatronic effects from Jim Henson are just superb as usual as there are just so many strange imaginative creatures to go around. From the good guys who are strange but pleasant looking like Bluto, Hoggle, and the knight fox character whom is my favorite of the bunch. That character reminds me a little of Rocket Racoon from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" as he a bit of a spitfire and has just this feisty energy always itching for a battle, but what really funny about him is despite the fact he's in deep crap he always refuses to admit defeat. Down to the Goblins whom despite on the unpleasant side are strangely cute and comical looking which makes them funny villains as by their nature their all imbisoles.The humor is great it's sort of Terry Pratchett like humor from the dialog and some of the other little things. One scene I thought was really funny and clever at the same time was seeing Hoggle spray Fairy's, we discover the Fairies aren't sweet things but actually pests, but sort of is part of the theme showing you can't take what you assume you know for granted as reality can be a whole different story. Even that scene with the knockers was funny, it's an absurdist visual joke but funny.However, the real power of the film is in its story and the substance it holds from within.I really like the characters: David Bowe is great as Jarith ""The Goblin King"". He's a fun villain I really like from some of his wardrobe down to his mannerism he's a sophisticated aristocratic villain. Despite his sinister motives if any are present, he's not totally evil as he really does seem like he wants to help Sarah, he's sort of that guardian angel figure but here he's a bad angel because he's steering Sarah in the wrong direction instead of the right, he wants to give her what she wants instead of what she really needs.Jennifer Connally one of my favorite actresses is just excellent in her role as Sarah, this was kind of another one of her starting roles and a good one at that. And yes, for the record I did have a crush on her when I was a kid she was one of the first actresses I had a crush on second to Alisa Milano from ""Who's the Boss"" but that's a different story. Anyway, I really do like her character she's somewhat sympathetic as she is a young teen on the verge of womanhood but is just struggling in coping with that transition.It's understandable because we've all gone through this (or some are about to), that's not an easy thing to deal with, having to leave remnants of childhood behind to go into the adulthood world isn't the most wonderful thought in the world; but also just the simple fear of losing ourselves in the process and becoming someone we don't want to be.Though at the same time subconsciously she very much wants to ascend into adulthood, but she just doesn't know how, this journey she takes in one heck of assent. I like the fact that her character is a dreamer as she's a person that loves fantasy and has big dreams of acting and making fantasy stories of her own.The film theme is clearly about coming of age, does have Freudian even Carl Jung like overtones in it. There is an interesting parallel dynamic between Sarah and Jaraith, to me Jaraith represents Sarah's Id complex as he is just enacting certain negative emotions and desires, she holds inside, which is true with all of us.The whole labyrinth world I like is one that sort of correlates with the mind as we see her room is full of stuffed toys which are the characters from the film, even an M.C. Escher poster and Labyrinth board game, much like with Dorothy and Oz how that a world connected with her mind set. I like that because it really shows the essence of fantasy how the worlds and whatever exists are an expression of our own psyche.But also according to Freud the maze is metaphoric for the journey from childhood to adulthood, it's never a straight path it's a destination that has twists and turns along the way, whatever turns and choices we make along the way shape the path to our own identity.There is even one disturbing but interesting scene where we see Sarah in this junk yard and as she spends more time in the replica of her room, we see a pack of stuff mainly consisting of childhood things pile onto her back; this sort of shows the danger of divulging too much into nostalgia and the past it's made her momentarily forget what's going on in the present and blind to the future, worst of all made herself trapped in a past long gone.This scene to me shows we can always remember it fondly and what really matters back then but we can't live or relive it otherwise we get lost in the past, present and future and make ourselves unable to build new things in all three areas.But the other important theme is the importance in keeping in touch with your inner child, to have fun with things from your past every once in a while, so that you don't forget who you are and you know where you're going in life and how you got there.Sarah goes through her own maze of life, just as we've go through our own.Rating: 4 stars",Labyrinth

Yes, it's a surreal, creepy Carrolian fairy tale but there's something more to it.Conelly is enchanting as a sweet little girl that society would say is a bit old to play make believe but still has a wisdom beyond her years when push comes to shove. A glance at the trivia section shows that a bunch of ideas ended up on the writer's room flaw but the effect is that we have a movie that is not totally up front about its many nuances and is as mysterious as it is bizarre.The puppetry is stunning and could so be nightmare fuel for your little one (I am trying to praise it here). The world they create has such character and it's only a horrid CGI and a blatant use of greenscreens in one seen that aren't executed superbly.A movie to watch over and over and still scratch your head over its cryptic subtext (it's there...I know it's there) but is still quite enjoyable regardless for its imagination, bizarity and the classic journey of such a sweet little female discovering a strange world and thus herself (see what I did there?) as well as the magic friendship along the way.I did find it off putting how casually they transition from banality to fantasy but if you give this movie the benefit of the doubt, everything here is justified in some way even if it's not always exactly obvious.",Labyrinth

But, not unlike Henson's 'The Dark Crystal', I found myself growing more and more emotionally detached as it went along. I try not to analyze these things too much as I'm watching it, but a comment by Roger Ebert that I read on its Wiki afterwords summed up my feelings perfectly; ""Ebert said that as the film was set in an ""arbitrary world"" none of the events in it had any consequences, robbing the film of any dramatic tension."".I would whole-heartedly recommend it on its artistry and imagination alone, but it seems like that focus left precious little time for the other elements of the film.",Labyrinth

59,TOMNEL,A fun movie filled with good songs and interesting eye candy.,7,2 April 2007,"Stars: Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie.A teenage girl, Sarah (Connelly) is living a fantasy life. One night she wishes the king of the goblins would take away her baby brother. When her fantasy becomes real and the Goblin King (Bowie) actually does take him away, it's up to her to travel through a labyrinth to the castle and save him. This film, is just a really easy movie to watch. It's very entertaining. Where it doesn't always make a lot of sense (and it doesn't have to), it still has really good looking puppets and sets, and Jennifer Connelly does a good acting job, as does Bowie. The songs in this, all written and sang by Bowie, are catchy and fun in their synthesized 80's style. My only problem with the film is it's lack of character development before Sarah is trapped in the Labyrinth, but it really doesn't affect the film. If you're looking for a light, family adventure, this is a good choice.My rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. PG for mild violence and mild language.",Labyrinth

The creators of this story obviously have a great imagination as do those of the Henson Workshop, who really brought lumps of foam and rubber to life brilliantly and in a fun way that makes the goblins acceptable for everyone.
The introduction of a few songs, helps the tale unfold and the scene inside her dreams has always inspired me to want to attend a proper Masquerade Ball.I think perhaps that David could have been provided with a decent dance belt, but for me he's actually perfect for this role.Oh to have a mind as clever as the makers of this film, it could only be a collaboration between Lucas and Henson.",Labyrinth

62,a_chinn,"My kids thought it was scary, weird, and were utterly enchanted by this muppet version of ""The Wizard of OZ""",8,24 July 2020,"I kicked off my quarantine home school film appreciation course with my children with a viewing of the 1986 classic ""Labyrinth."" My kids enjoyed the film, found it a bit scary, found it a bit weird, and were utterly mesmerized. Generally speaking, they had the exact reaction I was hoping they would. A young Jennifer Connelly, before she became a great actress, plays Sarah, a 16-year old girl forced by her stepmother (a nice fairytale touch) to watch her baby brother. During a crying fit by her baby brother, Sarah wishes for the Goblin King to take him away and unbeknownst to her, he's real (and played by David Bowie) and does indeed take Baby Toby away. Sarah then has thirteen hours to get through the titular Labyrinth to rescue her baby brother. For whatever reason, I'd never noticed how many similarities this film shares with ""The Wizard of OZ."" The filmmakers are pretty open about their riffing on that film. Besides a similar plot of a girl's journey across a magical and mysterious land, you also have her meetings a group of colorful non-human friends, facing various challenges, and even musical numbers (sadly the weakest part of this film, considering you have David Bowie). Besides those similarities, there are also smaller nods, such as spotting the Labyrinth in Connelly's bedroom early on in the film and then again at the end, or a moment in her journey where she falls asleep and forgets her quest goal, and how Hoggle, Sir Didymus, and Ludo are pretty clear stand-ins for the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Lion. However, ""Labyrinth"" is far more imaginative than OZ and is even surprisingly subversive. Once you've seen the Helping Hands, the Junk Lady, the Escher room scene, the Tilekeepers (the creature who move the Labyrinth tiles after Connolly puts marks on them), or the way the film's most terrifying moments are undone at the last moment by revealing their silly true nature (i.e. the tunnel cleaner grinding machine, or the giant metal monster, or the False Alarms, etc.). And if these examples aren't enough to convince you how incredibly subversive a children's film ""Labyrinth"" is, just take a look at the Bog of Stench scene, where the belching holes in the bog are very clearly representation of human butt-holes. If that's not subversion filmmaking, I do not know what is! And then there is David Bowie's pants... There's no getting around the fact that David Bowie's portrayal of The Goblin King, Jareth, is oddly sexual for a kids film, though maybe it's just his pants. Either way, he does make for an enjoyably scary and unusual villain for a children's film. Much like Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, Christopher Lloyd's Judge Doom from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", or The Child Catcher from ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", Bowie brings a great deal of menace to his villain without pandering to being a ""family friendly"" villain. All of this gleeful inappropriateness should not come as a surprise considering the film was written by Monty Python's Terry Jones, who's script is more than just clever mischievousness. It also shows unexpected depth. For example, the character of Hoggle is a surprisingly complicated, with an unexpected amount of depth. Played by Shari Weiser and voiced by Brian Henson, Hoggle is first introduced spraying pesticide to kill fairies outside the Labyrinth. He's a weaselly and cowardly character who demonstrates a genuine inner conflict whether he will help Connelly (out of her unexpected kindness and friendship) or whether he'll remain loyal to Bowie (out of fear). Bringing Jones' imaginative script to life was the Muppet master himself, Jim Henson. This was Henson's third and final feature film as a director. His other two films were ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""The Great Muppet Caper"". Jones brings a wealth of clever ideas to the OZ inspired script and Henson, who has a story credit on the script, brilliantly brings them to life in a way that is fun, scary, and endlessly watchable. There's a sense of wonder to the film where real world rules do not apply and anything is possible, and that is where the magic of the film lies. For the rest of the cast, beside Bowie and Connolly, you have Frank Oz (Yoda, Grover, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, etc), Warwick Davis (Willow, Wicket, The Leprechaun), Kenny ""Fidgit"" Baker (R2-D2, ""Time Bandits""), and two other Time Bandits, Malcolm ""Strutter"" Dixon and Jack ""Wally"" Purvis. Overall, just as with ""The Wizard of OZ"" this film doesn't shy away from being scary and weird, as do the most memorable of children's films and books, which helps to make ""Labyrinth"" something of a flawed classic. George Lucas served as one of the producers on the film. FUN FACT! One of the dance choreographers on the film is Cheryl McFadden. She appeared, uncredited, as one of the masked dancers in the ballroom scene. A year after this films release, she starred on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", credited as ""Gates McFadden"", playing Dr. Beverly Crusher.",Labyrinth

In fact it should be screened at at theatre production courses in colleges worldwide, because it shows pure creative brilliance in theatrical puppetry. Costume actors, Glove puppets, Black light puppets, cable puppets and animatronics. Labyrinth has them all. I was so impressed that i really didn't care that the story was sappy.It starts off by introducing us to Sarah, a self-obsessive adolescent who lives in her own fairy tale world. She is frustrated with her parents, especially for leaving her the task of staying home to watch over her baby brother Toby, while they go out for the night (at the the beginning of the movie). In her frustration the summons the fabled goblin King to come and take him away. The next thing she knows, He comes and takes Tobe away, back to his castle. Sarah begs the King to give him back, so he gives her thirteen hours to complete his labyrinth which leads to the castle and somewhere inside is Toby. on her Journey she encounters a myriad of weird critters and puzzles, and soon she teams up with three individuals. Hoggle, a midget with more wrinkles than Yoda, Ludo, a red haired Yak who walks on two legs and can move rocks with his voice. And then there is sir ... a puppy dressed in Renaissance clothing, with his 'somewhat' noble steed. Time is ticking and they must hurry.Labyrinth lives on quirks and funny faces.

64,Spleen,What's the chance of walking randomly through a labyrinth and hitting upon a plot?,4,18 July 1999,"David Bowie is the Goblin King.  No, really.  He is.  That's what I like about these goblins.  They're broad-minded.  They don't have the ridiculous restrictions of human monarchies, which tend to insist that the royal family be of the same species as its subjects.  The goblins don't even insist that their ruler have the same ontological status, since they choose a celebrity who exists in the real world to rule over fictional goblins.Something is deeply wrong with this movie.  Here's the story: Sarah, forced to baby-sit, remarks out loud that she wishes the Goblin King would take the child away.  So he does.  Moreover he lets Sarah know that she must rescue the child by midnight or not at all.  (How's that for an arbitrary plot device?)  So she sets off through fantasyland, collects more sidekicks than you could shake a stick at, confronts the Goblin King, et cetera. According to the screenwriter, after she steps into fantasyland (that is, after filming began), they sort of made up events as they went along.  Surprise, surprise.There are a lot of great muppets along the way (conceptual drawings were by Brian Froud, who also did ""The Dark Crystal""), but the strain of pretending that the film's going anywhere begins to show.  But the true failure of invention is saved for the very end.  Just in the nick of time, Sarah makes it through the Labyrinth to see the Goblin King in the flesh - and it's David Bowie.  It's as if he's tonight's special guest star on ""The Muppets"".Sorry.  They needed a story.

David Bowie brings a wonderful charisma (and some dodgy tights) to the film as the Goblin King and, of course, some great songs too (he should sing with an ensemble of Muppets more often).There are scary bits (the things that take themselves apart - voiced by Red Dwarf's Danny John Jules - scared the bejesus out of me as a kid), funny bits (I quote: ""You're mamma was a fraggin' aardvark!""), touching bits, thoughtful bits and uplifting bits. The awesomeness (it's a word because I say it is) of this film, despite everything mentioned above, is in no small part due to the efforts of Jim Henson's Creature Shop. From the friendly, furry giant Ludo to the host of comically grotesque goblins, the puppets in the film give it life, colour and most of it's humour.Henson brought the Labyrinth world to life exquisitely, it's set in a maze of crumbling walls, with vast statues, guttering candles, weeds and branches, pits filled with talking hands, hedge mazes, swamps, a medieval village and an eerie masque that threatens to bespell Sarah. While much of the setting is earthy and solid, there's still a glittering, eerie sense of dangerous yet beautiful things that might appear out of nowhere. Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its goofy streak, such as the self-dismembering Fireys, when it works best as a semi-serious piece. But the writing is excellent, a mixture of sublime prettiness (""Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one"") and goofiness.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Labyrinth
68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Labyrinth""- An indisputable classic of its era that still managers to wildly enthrall and to magically entertain audiences.",8,4 May 2017,"There's something about the 1980's. A decade that has been since looked upon with both the greatest of nostalgia for its accomplishments and also with a touch of embarrassment for its faults. It was a strange time. And yet, a magical time. And this is perhaps best reflected in the wide plethora of films released over that ten year period that seem to perfectly encapsulate the social and pop-culture sensibilities of the time. So many films of the 80's are now looked upon as contemporary classics and are widely beloved by fans the world over. From the light-hearted thrills of ""The Goonies"" to darker and more mature family releases such as ""The Neverending Story"", to cult- classics like ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""Return to Oz"" and slasher-film horror including ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""... The 80's produced some of the finest nostalgic films of the past fifty years.One of the more peculiar releases of this era is most certainly the 1986 release ""Labyrinth""- a sort-of combined effort brought to us by director Jim Henson, producer George Lucas and the late phenomena that was David Bowie- here both a co-star and songwriter. The film was something of a troubled experience for all involved when it first came out, garnering a harsh mixed-to-negative critical reception and failing to generate much box-office buzz at the time of its initial release. And yet, it's one of those wonderful experiences that happens every so often... where a film is a failure at first, but slowly builds an ever-growing cult audience that gives it a second life on home- video. And because of this, ""Labyrinth"" is now considered an indisputable classic of the 80's. One of the most beloved and cherished films of its era. And I do think this is for good reason. While it might not quite attain the high level of quality that marked other similar releases, it's a fine film and is filled to burst with imagination and pure, untainted fun.Fifteen-year-old Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is disappointed with her baby-brother Toby, whom she sees as a burden and a distraction. While babysitting him one night and growing tired of his meddlesome crying, she recites a magical incantation from a play she earlier read at the park, and beckons the ""Goblin King"" to come and take him away... only to be surprised when he actually arrives in her home in the form of the suave and stunning Jareth. (Bowie) Realzing her mistake, she pleads with Jareth not to take her brother away, and he delivers a proposition... if she will come to his magical world and solve his mysterious Labyrinth within 13 hours, he will give her Toby back and leave them alone. And thus, Sarah must traverse this mysterious maze to save her brother, all while encountering new friends and allies and defeating treacherous booby-traps and puzzles.The film is a fascinating work and is generally completely absorbing and magical. The combined efforts in the talents of Henson, Lucas, Bowie and all others involved make for an extremely polished and wild experience. From the vastness of the titular Labyrinth, to the many fantasy creatures that populate its corridors, to the delightfully quirky dialog of writer Terry Jones, the film is a whirlwind of imagination. It takes a relatively simple premise- one that is set up in the opening minutes of the film and is honestly only there to give something of a storyline to follow- and uses it expertly to deliver 100 minutes of world-building and fantastical creations. Some have bemoaned the rather stock characters and simplicity of the narrative, but that seems to be by very design... this is a film about dream-like creations and wicked vision, and it delivers. And we get a handful of new musical numbers courtesy the brilliant mind that was David Bowie to boot! (Even if they can feel a bit jarring...)The film is pretty consistent in its ability to charm the audience with a wonderful cast of characters. Co-stars Bowie and Connelly, though far from their best work as actors here, are a lot of fun to follow. Particularly the scenery- chewing Bowie, who lights up the screen during the many musical sequences. Connelly has a few hiccups here and there early on, but by the end, you definitely start to see shades of the actress who would later go on to win the Accademy Award. The cast of characters also includes a number of puppet-creations courtesy Henson's workshop, and there's no way that the well-meaning but self-loathing dwarf Hoggle or enormous oafish beast Ludo won't instantly win your heart.Unfortunately, I can't help but feel that despite being a personal favorite and an easy classic of its time, I just can't bring myself to give ""Labyrinth"" a perfect review. Because there are some missteps along the way that can detract from the film. While I refuse to spoil it, certain choices were made creatively for the third act that do feel... incorrect for the film as a whole and it does sort-of bother me. The film's delightful ""Wizard of Oz"" tonality of wandering about and finding new misadventures along the way generally pays off, but has a few moments that feel superfluous and unnecessary. (""Chilly Down with Fire"" being a prime example) And yes, the story can be a bit too light for some viewers. While it didn't overtly bother me, and I think critics of the time exaggerated the impact of the lighter story... I can't help but think just a wee-bit more narrative could have helped out.However, none of these facts can deter the fact that as a whole experience, ""Labyrinth"" is a classic of its time. It's enthralling. Exciting. Imaginative. And much as it has for thirty years now, its audience will continue to grow. And people will never get tired of wandering about its paths and corridors. I give it a very good 8 out of 10.",Labyrinth

70,mike48128,A Jim Henson and David Bowie Masterpiece,10,4 January 2015,"Far more entertaining than ""The Dark Crystal"" and perhaps Henson's answer to ""Fantasia"". It's a good comparison, as both were the best work of two media geniuses, and neither were financial successes at the box office. Both were also ""panned"" by movie critics. David Bowie is the only person who could have played ""Jereth"" the Goblin King. His songs and the main theme fit the movie perfectly. Produced with all the cutting edge ""wizardry"" of it's time, it still holds up well today. The story is a bit confusing at first, because the ""prologue"" was either cut from the screenplay or the film. Her mother is not dead. Her dad has remarried. Mom ""ran off"" with a rock star that strongly resembled David Bowie. How does magic fit into all of this? Does she imagine the whole thing? It's a fantasy. The comparisons to ""Alice and Wonderland"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Where the Wild Things Are"" are (somewhat) obvious. ""Sarah"" must wander through the enchanted ""Labyrinth"" to save ""Toby"", her new baby brother, from The Goblin King. Costume issues: Jennifer, like Annette Funicello, is growing up much too fast, and her costumes try to minimize this. David Bowie is a bit too ""perky"" in his skin-tight spandex tights. Instead of the Cowardly Lion, we have the furry cowardly gentle giant beast ""Ludo"". Very entertaining and otherwise quite original with incredible special effects. Amazing puppetry, and a lot of people in ""Muppet suits"". All new characters. None of the usual Muppet gang. As in all Henson productions, war-like behavior is ridiculed, as is greed and avaricious behavior. (The ""Junk Lady"" is the collector of useless, meaningless items, and shows that these things ""cling"" to all of us.) Children will see it as ""fairy tale"" or adventure. Adults will comprehend it's deeper meaning. My only dislikes are the gnome peeing in the stream, and the ""Bog of Eternal Stench"". The ""helping hands"" are a 40 foot drop! The giant mechanical warrior is an amazing feat. Perhaps the world's tallest ""Muppet"". The talking ""cannon-balls"" (""Did I hit anything?"") are too much fun! Trademark Henson ending, with a reprise of all the ""imaginary"" characters! Excellent featurettes show how amazing the puppetry and sets were, especially for 1986!

In fact, I think the only specific Henson related thing that I can place in a time in my childhood is Muppets Treasure Island. I wish I saw Labyrinth when I was a child as I can tell its most powerful aspect is nostalgia. Granted, I would've found it way too scary. It's an oddly hit and miss film throughout. Sometimes it's movie magic and sometimes it's a complete flop that I'm really not a fan of. The action sequences, besides the ones that go on for too long, are fantastic with a great affection that I love, but the music sequences are the purest of cheese. Sometimes too slow and sometimes too quick, sometimes timeless and sometimes dated, there's a strange imbalance about the film but fortunately, due to Terry Jones' screenplay, there's a great dry Monty Python (albiet 'for kids' version) sense of humour throughout.

73,sme_no_densetsu,Imaginative fantasy adventure from Jim Henson & company,7,11 February 2016,"""Labyrinth"" is a film that holds a special place in the hearts of many children of the eighties. Initially a box office disappointment, the film has nevertheless built up a strong cult following in the 30 years since its release.The story concerns a selfish teen girl (16-year old Jennifer Connelly) who, inspired by a play that she's rehearsing, wishes for her baby brother to be taken away by goblins. Realizing that her idle wish has come true, she must then embark on a quest to rescue her brother from the fearsome Goblin King (David Bowie).Future Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly ably carried the film in one of her earliest roles while David Bowie's distinctive portrayal of Jareth ranks as arguably his most memorable screen performance. Additionally, the many talented performers involved in bringing to life the denizens of the labyrinth are deserving of high praise.The screenplay by Monty Python alumni Terry Jones is grounded in fairy tale tradition but shows abundant imagination. Filled with twists and turns, the viewer never knows what to expect. Apart from the main plot, there are a handful of songs that were expressly written for the movie by David Bowie but I wouldn't rank them among his best work. Their distinctly 80's sound doesn't exactly argue for the movie's timelessness.Helmed by legendary puppeteer Jim Henson, the movie shows considerable care in bringing the labyrinth's fantastic creatures to life. Visually, the movie has an alternately colourful and moody look that takes full advantage of the marvellous production design. The special effects are pretty good as well, including some CGI that was ahead of its time.Ultimately, ""Labyrinth"" is a thoroughly entertaining family-oriented fantasy adventure, though one that does show its age to some extent. Still, with a combination of fine performances, an imaginative storyline and appealing visuals, ""Labyrinth"" promises a memorable viewing experience for fantasy lovers both young and old.",Labyrinth
74,pyrocitor,"Watch, Magic Watch",9,18 January 2016,"After unfathomably being greeted with ambivalence in 1986, the past 30 years have shown generations of children and former children alike coming to their senses and regarding Jim Henson's Labyrinth as the cult classic turned indisputable classic it deserves to be. Sure, it's a figurative remake of Alice in Wonderland (and if that's enough to deter you, there's the secret pathway out of the Labyrinth - please use it), but Henson's uniquely clunky practical effects aesthetic lends it a bricolage magic that's wholeheartedly its own. Indeed, if Labyrinth is derivative, Henson shows excellent taste in source material, as his work here could serve as the template for the perfect children's fairy tale - it's visually spectacular, bursting with imagination and heart, isn't afraid to delve into the realm of the dark and scary, but always with a purpose, and peppers its fantastic journey with moral messages that feel impressively unforced and genuine. Not too shabby for a film initially sneered at by Roger Ebert as ""never really com{ing} alive,"" n'est pas? Like any good fantasy parable, it's as profound as you'd like it to be. Sure, there's a time-worn narrative of assuming responsibility and growing up (interestingly tweaked by addressing, rather than shying away from, protagonist Sarah's tentative sexual awakening, as evidenced in her fabrication of the strangely sensual Goblin King), friendship and forgiveness, but Henson also works in delightfully disturbing vignettes cautioning against mindless materialism and mob mentality (and even, arguably, a Snow White-esq allegory for date-rape drugs), all the more affecting in their surreality. It's also worth noting that Alice never came up against a perpetually farting sludge swamp called ""The Bog of Eternal Stench"" (did I mention Monty Python stalwart Terry Jones was a co-writer?). Her loss. Viewed 30 years after the fact, the film now plays as a breathtaking love letter to the days of pre-CGI puppetry, and the boundless imagination of maestro Jim Henson. There's remarkable depth to Labyrinth's seemingly barren landscapes, and, as Sarah is quickly cautioned, it takes a more careful look to really drink it in. Sure every painstaking puppet on display is indisputably impressive, but it's in the little details that the film really ""comes alive"". Take the tiny, earnest worm who invites Sarah in to ""meet the missus,"" or a nightmarish, scarring tunnel of ""helping hands"" treated as a throwaway gag, let alone the forest full of gibbering creatures who cavalierly rip off their heads only to turn it into a gruesomely carnivalesque dance number as trace examples of the film's cauldron of creativity. Henson has a remarkable ability to conjure up genuinely frightening imagery, and yet have it feel appropriate and wholesome all the while. And hey - anyone who can work a climactic showdown around an transposed M.C. Escher set is all right in my books. As the film's human component, teenaged Jennifer Connelly demonstrates a perfect awareness of the keen talent to come. She carefully ensures that Sarah hits the exact right balance of dreamy and impetuous enough to evidence a character arc, while sharp and feisty enough to avoid being excessively whiney or self-absorbed, and culminates being one of the few teen leads to remain wholly sympathetic throughout. Regardless, there's no denying that the film belongs to David Bowie, cementing his place in generations of children's hearts with his deliciously silky, playfully menacing Jareth the Goblin King, and cementing his #1 spot in 'most distracting filmic codpieces' for everyone else. Bowie not only contributes some infectiously fun tunes to the soundtrack - it will forever be impossible to avoid bopping around to ""Magic Dance"", while ""As the World Falls Down"" remains hauntingly evocative - but he throws so much into a performance other actors would have slept through that it's clear he's having a ball. Bowie is even insightful enough to play up the paradoxes inherent in his fantasy creation - he exists both to frighten Sarah but also serve her every need - while his cavorting around with abducted baby Toby shows a strangely protective tenderness, making his an intriguingly nuanced fairy tale foe. It helps invaluably that the puppets bobbing around them feel not like puppets but an unforgettable cast of characters. Lovable furry behemoth Ludo and chattery Sir Didymus (who himself feels like a Python outtake), let alone the charmingly self-loathing and neurotic Hoggle, really shouldn't interact so seamlessly, but somehow they all blend into the quirkiness of Henson's framework indispensably. If nothing else, the fact that a fairy tale involving puppets, synth-pop tunes and David Bowie in a neon mullet has not only survived the 80s, but actually improved with age, is testament to Labyrinth's timeless appeal for children old and young. Henson's magnificently kooky fable still glows with spectacular imagination and a heartwarming earnestness, coupled with discerningly dark subtext, and two infectiously enjoyable lead performances. Whether uninitiated or a veritable goblin yourself, it's undeniably worth taking a jump, magic jump into Labyrinth, and experiencing one of cinema's most enjoyable nightmares anew.

76,emasterslake,Be careful what you wished for.,7,25 March 2006,"This is another non-Kermit the Frog movie Jim Henson did.Labyrinth is about Sarah, a teenage girl who's into fantasy a lot. She hates taking care of her little brother and wishes that he could go away so she can feel more peaceful about herself.And speak of the devil she says the magic words as her brother is taken away by Goblins and she meets the goblin king who would offer her an opportunity to live a happier life.But all she wants is her brother back. So she's taken to the world of Goblins and must take the challenge of the Labryth maze. She has 13 hours to get her brother back or he'll end up as a goblin forever.She meets new friends, danger and a sign of hope if she believes in herself.Labryth has the same theme as Dark Crystal does. It was directed and thought up by Jim Henson himself. Has impressive muppets and creatures in it. Plus it's done by the people who did the Star Wars movies as well.I figure those who like Dark Crystal might like this one as well. It's a real treat and a perfect fantasy for someone's girlfriend.",Labyrinth
77,mentalcritic,A relic of a time that seems wonderful by comparison,8,24 February 2005,"Oh dear, Jim Henson, you are sorely missed. Not necessarily because you went before your time, or even in somewhat rotten circumstances. No, it is because unlike the purveyors of so-called family entertainment these days, your work was actually entertaining to the whole family. When I was a lad, I used to think these films were childish and patronising. By comparison to what is being aimed at the children of my cousins, it is MENSA material, and I realise now that it was far more brilliant than I had previously given it credit for. Indeed, compared to the ""you're not good if you don't have good feelings"" rubbish that the likes of B'Harni fill the heads of children with, Henson productions deserve a medal.At its heart, Labyrinth is a simple fable about how much we miss something once it is gone. A young girl wishes that her annoying stepbrother would disappear, only to find when he is gone that she misses him. Enter the Goblin King, played with a great malice by David Bowie. The challenge the Goblin King sets almost sounds like a video game. Indeed, one popular Commodore 64 game of the time set the challenge of collecting the pieces to solve a key puzzle to save the world in a certain time period. Labyrinth was even adapted into a game for the Commodore 64. In Labyrinth the film, this young woman named Sarah, played with a certain kind of brilliance by a young Jennifer Connelly, is challenged to navigate a massive labyrinth in less than thirteen hours, lest her brother become one of the Goblins.It sounds like a very simple idea, and it is. What makes Labyrinth the under-appreciated classic that it is is in the details. As previously indicated, the leads are absolutely brilliant. While David Bowie chews scenery like there is no tomorrow, Jennifer Connelly gets so into her character that she makes it seem perfectly natural when she is interacting with some of Jim Henson's most ludicrous creations. The scene in which she rescues a giant yeti-like thing called Ludo is one of the most superbly-made things in the history of children's film. It is also worth noting that in contrast to the aforementioned normalism of B'Harni and his ilk, Henson's creations taught the valuable lesson that appearances are not the sum total of a living creature's character. Ludo looks like he could tear apart our protagonist, but his manner and speech show him as one of the most gentle and lovable characters ever depicted in film.As you might guess from this film featuring David Bowie as the top-billed star, there are also a few song and dance numbers. Some of them, such as the magic dance number, are immortally embarrassing. Or at least, they would be, if not for two things. First, the suspension of disbelief that Henson so admirably achieves with his puppets is a real pleasure. Second, Bowie's golden voice could charm the paint off walls. When he sings ""I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry"", it stands out like a stark reminder of why this man used to be able to sign record deals worth tens of millions of dollars. It may even bring tears to your eyes.If Labyrinth does have a weakness, it is in the closing reels. The final song from Bowie stretches the scene beyond its welcome, but it recovers nicely once Sarah returns to the real world. The compositing work in the Firey sequence is rather lousy, and the story seems to grind to a halt when they do their song and dance number. On the other hand, their song and dance number is still incredibly amusing to behold.In all, I gave Labyrinth an eight out of ten. It is not perfect. In fact, I wonder if whomever designed Bowie's costume was not playing an elaborate joke upon him. But for all of its problems, Labyrinth is an underrated classic. One of the few films that is advertised as being for all ages, and can entertain audiences of that description. A great light went out in our world when Jim Henson passed away.",Labyrinth
78,Beta_Gallinger,A pleasurable fantasy flick from Jim Henson and Lucasfilm,8,30 December 2008,"This is one of the films I saw a number of times in my childhood (it came out the year I was born). Like Jim Henson's 1982 film, ""The Dark Crystal"", this is a puppet fantasy film (though some humans appear in this one), but I didn't see the first film of the two that much while growing up, and now that I have seen it more than once within the past couple years, I have to admit, while many like it, I don't. However, watching ""Labyrinth"" again twice in the past couple years, my first viewings in probably nearly a decade at least, was different, in a good way. I now see more flaws in the film than I used to back in the day, but it certainly hasn't completely lost its charm.Sarah is a fifteen-year-old girl with a strong passion for fantasy and fairy tales. One night, her father and stepmother leave her to babysit her baby half-brother, Toby. Soon after they leave, Sarah is annoyed by Toby's non-stop crying, and after saying some lines from ""Labyrinth"", one of the books she likes, she says she wishes the goblins would come and take him away! Soon after she says this, she sees that Toby is no longer in his crib! She meets Jareth the Goblin King, and realizes what she has done! The goblins really have taken the baby boy, and he will become one of them in thirteen hours unless Sarah makes it through a labyrinth to their castle in time! So, the teenager then begins her trek, and learns that the labyrinth is very dangerous and complex! Jareth will only make it harder for her! The main character, Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly (one of her early film roles), is unfortunately a bit of an absurd one. A fifteen-year-old getting all worked up over a baby taking her teddy bear?! She can be maybe a tad irritating at times, and Connelly doesn't put on a very good performance in the role, which makes the film lose points. Fortunately, this only occasionally drags the film down, and there's enough to make up for that one character. On the journey, Sarah meets a number of likable and sometimes humorous puppet characters, and finds herself in some fascinating places. The humour is sometimes perhaps a little too kiddish, but I still got a good number of laughs from it. The 1986 fantasy flick also contains suspense and appropriate music for it. Rock star David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King is another highlight, and so are some of the songs he contributed to the film.This Jim Henson project tanked at the box office, but fortunately, since then, it seems to have turned out to be one of those films which has gained a strong cult following since its box office failure, and I certainly can't question why! Although by no means perfect, ""Labyrinth"" is a decent fantasy film, directed by Jim Henson and co-written by Henson, poet Dennis Lee, and Terry Jones of Monty Python fame! With all the puppets and sets, it obviously took a lot of effort and a lot of people to make this movie, many people who deserve a lot of credit, and their hard work paid off! Does this film have more for kids than adults? Well, maybe, but it's definitely not strictly a kids' movie. Many adults seem to like it as well, and seeing it after growing up, that doesn't surprise me.",Labyrinth
79,one9eighty,An a-MAZE-ing film for all the family,8,25 January 2016,"Mix Jim Henson's directing and puppets with Jennifer Connelly's acting and David Bowie's acting and music and you have the Labyrinth, a 1986 cult classic with thrills, spills, fun, humor, and a good story suitable for the entire family.Connolly plays Sarah, a selfish 16 year old girl, who was supposed to be babysitting her baby brother but instead of caring for the infant she wishes him away to the Goblin King, Jareth, played by Bowie. Thus starts the adventure; Sarah has to rescue baby brother Toby from a magical fantasy world controlled by Jareth and his goblin folk. Jareth imprisons Toby in the Goblin castle in the middle of a Labyrinth and Sarah has only 13 hours to rescue him before he's lost forever. Along the way Sarah faces many perils but she is helped by Hoggle (a wrinkly, grumpy inhabitant of the labyrinth), Ludo (a massive hairy beast), Sir Didymus (a fox/ knight), and Ambrosius (Didymus' cowardly sheepdog/ makeshift steed).This film is not just fun it's visually appealing and imaginative with puppets galore as well as well imagined scenery. There are clues to events in the film littered around Sarah's room at the start of the film and reinforced at the end which serve to demonstrate that it's not just a random magical world but partly also Sarah's imagination which is driving the sights in the film, take for example the picture of Bowie and the statue of a Goblin king on Sarah's dressing table, or a poster of impossible stairways on the Sarah's bedroom wall.This is also a clever film delivering a message that it's okay to be imaginative but also reinforcing the values of maturity. At the start of the film Sarah is selfish and moody much like a child but by the end of the film and the journey Sarah has become responsible and caring, almost as if the film was a metaphor for Sarah's journey through puberty and blossoming into a responsible young lady.Be enchanted by an A-MAZE-ing film, if you haven't seen it yet then you really should spare some time to watch a film which can still stand on it's own two feet in a cinematic world which has evolved massively.",Labyrinth
80,Ruskington,Magical puppet surrealism,7,22 September 2020,"Few things scared me more as a child than watching David Bowie in Labyrinth. Re-watching the film as a grown man, it still kind of freaks me out if I'm perfectly honest. Irrational phobias aside, this is a movie with it's own unique style of magic and enchantment that always felt like a very personal experience.It is certainly looking dated and the acting leaves a lot to be desired, but there is enough charm and originality for the film to remain relevant and exciting. Bowie's compositions add an extremely surreal air to the movie and Jim Henson's weird and wonderful creatures are perfectly loveable.

The costumes and puppets really feel alive especially when they're interacting with the main lead Sara (Jennifer Connelly).

In addition to navigating through the land she befriends a few of the inhabitants who tag along with her.She meets the grumpy dwarf named Hoggle (Brian Wilson) and gentle giant named Ludo, a fox named Sir Didymus and his dog Ambrosius. The sets look amazing. You really feel like you're there. This world is both fascinating and terrifying like ours. The acting's well done though I noticed some of the dialogue comes off as clunky. It goes without saying but Bowie steals the show. He has an interesting presence each time he appears. The jokes are mostly funny. The scene where the firebirds are dancing was cool and hilarious.It's a shame this didn't receive the acclaim it has now because this's very underrated.

82,Atreyu_II,Alice in Wonderland + The Wizard of Oz = Labyrinth?,4,9 July 2009,"Considering the high rating this movie has (7.3), I expected something much better. So many comments around here say how good this movie is, but to be sincere I didn't enjoy it.The story wasn't much involving, the characters not very likable, the puppets ugly and annoying, the soundtrack was okay but nothing exceptional and not adequate for a fantasy motion picture, the lines were weak (although I did like some lines, such as «You have no power over me» and «So you think my labyrinth is piece of cake?») and the humor wasn't funny at all.The movie has some enjoyable special effects and sometimes a few nice visuals, but that's not enough. The soundtrack is entirely performed by David Bowie. I don't really like David Bowie's music (never did). There is only one song of him that I really like: ""Let's Dance"" - but that great song isn't in this movie.About the characters, I didn't like very much Jareth the King of Goblins, but I did like him as a barn owl, however. I also liked the two sheepdogs, the worm and Toby. Sarah was okay, but not all that captivating. Plus, Sarah was obnoxious at the beginning, especially towards her infant brother.I hated all the Goblins, including Hoggle, Ludo and Sir Didymus. As for Sir Didymus, he was so irritating in the first minutes he enters in scene that I almost couldn't take it. I strongly disliked the battles either.The labyrinth was quite complex, but well made. The castle was nice and the strange special effects on the stairs at the end were well done, even if a little childish for me. I also liked some of the landscapes and the special effects on the clocks by the character Jareth.The movie was directed by Jim Henson, a great puppeteer well known for his imaginative work in ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show"".The cast was okay in their roles, but nobody was really remarkable. Still, the best was probably David Bowie with is British accent, despite that ridiculous long hair, more eccentric and exaggerated than Limahl's.This movie seems to be a mix of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"". Some minor clues also seem to have been inspired on ""The Neverending Story"", but without the success of that one.",Labyrinth
83,tomimt,"All in all, pretty good family yarn",7,28 September 2008,"Sarah (Jennifer Connely) feels under-appreciated. Like Cinderella she feels like she's just a slave for her stepmother and that her father doesn't really care. So one evening, when she's forced to watch over her new baby brother Toby for an umpteenth time, she makes a careless wish for a goblin king to snatch the annoyance out of her life. And sometimes you get what you fish for. The goblin king Jareth (David Bowie) does what is asked from him and he takes the baby to his castle, located in the middle of huge, shape shifting labyrinth and Sarah has only 13 hours to get her brother back, or he's turned into a little goblin.I have to admit I warmed up slowly to this movie. The opening was quite good, but the first half in the labyrinth felt a bit jarring and forced, despite the art direction of this movie is top notch in every way imaginable. One other reason for my reluctant warming was the 80's rock sounds made by David Bowie, which I felt were a bit more of a hindrance than a merit.But after I had watched a while and some new characters emerged I begun to enjoy the movie more and it did leave a quite nice after taste after it ended. This all is thanks to fantastic creature and set design of the film and I have to admit, that in the end, some of the music tunes of the tale are pretty catchy.So as an advice, if you don't like it right away from the beginning, let it got a bit further into the Labyrinth, as it was in there the movie fully opened up to me.",Labyrinth

87,Eumenides_0,Fun Fantasy Movie,6,31 July 2009,"Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is a teenager fond of fantasy and make-believe. But she's also a hot-head and a bit selfish, so one day she wishes her baby brother Toby be taken away by Goblins. The Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie) appears in her room and grants her wish. But Sarah immediately regrets it and is given a chance to recover the baby if she complete the Goblin King's labyrinth in 13 hours.Labyrinth is a movie that walks the thin line between an all-out children's movie and a fantasy spoof that adults who like to watch clichés subverted can enjoy.From a technical point of view, this movie is excellent. Jim Henson created all the creatures and they're visually complex and wonderful. The sets are also marvellous, including the labyrinth, especially when see from above, and a sequence in a room with stairs that go up and down, and to the sides, like in the famous Escher painting.The story is solid and because of its simplicity there are few plot holes. The characters that Sarah meets along the way are also lovely: there's Ludo, a giant monster who's a bit simpled minded but adorable; Sir Didymus, a chivalric fix who mounts a dog and is afraid of nothing, even when the odds are ridiculously against him; and Hoggle, a cowardly goblin who slowly discovers friendship.This movie is certainly full of simple but timeless messages about courage, honesty, selflessness and friendship and so it's a perfect movie for children.There are some grating moments, like when David Bowie starts singing; they're so embarrassing and unnecessary you feel like skipping them. I think good movies like Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence and The Prestige have shown that Bowie is not just a singer but an excellent actor too. He needn't sing in all his roles. It's just an annoying way of getting a viewer out of the story.Anyone who enjoys a good fantasy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously should enjoy this movie.",Labyrinth
88,LebowskiT1000,Near and dear to my heart.,8,25 October 2002,"This is one of those films that is truly near and dear to my heart.  I probably first saw this film when I was 9 or 10 and just loved this film from that day on.  Since then I've watched this movie many many times.  I'm not really sure what it is about this film, but there is something that just makes me feel happy and is just an all-around fun movie to watch.Like I said, this film is one of those special movies for me, but the things I'm about to say could very easily get me savagely beaten if I said this to a hard-core fan of the film.  So, even though I love this film there is a few things that I've NEVER liked about this film and the biggest one is David Bowie.  What is he doing in this movie?  I don't understand what people like about this guy, I really dislike his music and REALLY dislike his music in this film.  I'm sorry, I know some of you out there are steaming right now, but it's just the way I feel.  I honestly cringe every time David opens his mouth in this film.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!The only other major complaint I have about this film is the very end of the film.  I can't stand how anti-climatic it is.  David and Jennifer are talking and sort of arguing, she repeats some lines from her book and then he throws the little glass sphere in the air and she's suddenly back home. I'm sorry...but, LAME!!!  Even when I was a kid I didn't like this end.  I think I usually shut it off by the time I got to this part, because all the cool stuff had already happened.END OF SPOILERSI know I'm really sounding like I didn't like the film, but I really did like the film a great deal.  There is some excellent comedy in the film, spectacular special effects, great puppeteering, and interesting characters (my personal favorite is Ludo...with Sir Didymus as a close second).If you haven't seen this film by now, I really do suggest you see it.

Upon finishing it, I was thoroughly impressed. Wasting no time with the beginning, it got right into the action. Although I wasn't fond of this, it picked up and quickly became a phenomenal movie. Labyrinth captures what modern movies could never do. The characters are quirky and the costumes fantastic. I can't imagine this being made nowadays and it still being enjoyable. The costumes and special effects are part of what made the movie so memorable. If that was replaced with CGI the movie wouldn't have as fun to look at and overall wouldn't have felt like anything special. With age comes greatness it seems.

90,elicopperman,A David Bowie Vehicle Disguised as a Jim Henson Film,7,24 November 2019,"There are some movies that feel like vehicles for certain singers and performers of their heyday to parade around in. Jim Henson's Labyrinth is by no means an exception, but it is still a fascinating flick from the late muppet master's filmography that has rightfully garnished the cult following it was destined for. Unlike Henson's previous non Muppets feature The Dark Crystal, this film feels a lot more like its own stand-alone narrative than a full fledged series that got squished down into one movie. It also helps that the cast is mostly made of muppets, yet has leads made up of real actors, making for quite an intriguing experience.The film revolves around an imaginative teenaged girl named Sarah Williams, as she ventures on a quest through an enormous abstract maze to rescue her infant brother Toby, whom she had wished away to Jareth the Goblin King. Although the story is pretty basic in concept, what does make the film very entertaining are the obstacles Sarah faces along her perilous journey. As she ends up in a dark fantasy world, she encounters all kinds of bizarre creatures, booby traps and even surreal paradoxes that are enough to fascinate any viewer who has never seen this film before. In addition, the Goblin King constantly ruins Sarah's attempts at finding her baby brother by attempting to lend her dreams over the offspring. Granted, most of what she does face are little more than one set piece after another, but the individual scenes are still well paced and even somewhat tense given the high tension needed for a goal as dire as rescuing the innocent from the clutches of evil. Only a true act of bravery and confidence will overcome any dangerous situation.Now it's time for what makes this movie remembered to this day: David Bowie and the overall craft. One can tell Bowie was having a blast playing the villainous Jareth, as he nearly steals the show with his vibrant personality, subtle cunning tactics, lively charisma and intimidating dances. The few musical numbers the movie offers are also a delight to view, as people could either get off their seats and dance to the upbeat lyrics or be enthralled by the splendid choreography displayed all around the environments. Speaking of said environments, the puppetry on the film is incredible. There are numerous shots with over twenty muppet characters around and their movements are so believable that you feel like you're watching living breathing creatures rather than just figures. Even much of the computer effects look very creative and stylized given the magical surrealism around the Labyrinth. There's also a brilliant homage to M.C. Escher at a certain point that just adds in to the film's fun content and mysterious tone. Needless to say, the effects practically make Jareth's world come to life.However, as enjoyable as the feature is, it's not without its shortcomings. For one, Jennifer Connelly is a little underwhelming as Sarah, as she comes off a little too dry for a narrative that requires numerous stakes to occur. Also, while many of the creatures Sarah meets look unique by design, they can either range from bland to downright annoying; let's just say it's a relief they're only supporting characters. Hoggle may be the one exception though, as he goes from tricking Sarah into ruining her quest to soon helping her succeed. Not to mention, some scenes of Sarah overcoming obstacles fall a little flat due to the literal-minded nature coming off as a bit pretentious and even somewhat complicated for a family film (what is this, a Lewis Carroll novel?). Lastly, as upbeat and technologically innovative the Fireys sequence is for its time, it sadly doesn't age well and feels more at place on MTV than a $25 million budgeted movie. Plus, you could have either trimmed that scene or flat out changed it to something more creepy and the transitioning would have been a lot stronger.Overall, in spite of its storytelling flaws, Labyrinth still remains a highly entertaining musical fantasy worth checking out for the shear liveliness of it. I'm sure we all miss the Stardust man to this day, so watching this film at any time is a noteworthy tribute in its own way. That, and most of what Jim Henson created outside of the Muppet gang's filmography is unique enough to view, even if they're not all great. It's a shame that his alternate work did not immediately catch on at first, but at least time has become more friendly to it all that we can see their magic unfold even more now than they did before.",Labyrinth
91,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: Labyrinth (1986),8,30 May 2005,Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is a teenage girl who lives in a fantasy world of goblins and magic. But her fantasy becomes reality when the Goblin King (David Bowie) takes her stepbrother. Now she has thirteen hours to solve the massive Labyrinth and make her way to the Goblin castle beyond. Along the way she befriends several of Henson's fantastic Muppet creations for the final battle.This wonderfully produced and magical fantasy is great fun from the beginning to the end.

92,grendelkhan,Wondefully engaging.,8,7 September 2006,"Labrynth is a tremendously engaging film which served to showcase the young talents of Jenifer Connelly, as well as highlight those of David Bowie. The Henson crew is well represented in the many memorable characters, as well as Brian Froud's imaginative designs.The story borrows heavily from both Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz, where a young girl is whisked away to a fantasy world, or is she? Is it all in her imagination, or is her imagination so powerful that it has created a living world?Young Sarah feels put upon, having to watch her baby brother and being pulled from her fantasy world into a much darker and less satisfying reality. Typical teenage stuff. She makes a poorly chosen wish, and lives to regret it. She must enter her fantasy realm, and soon finds it is far more dangerous than in her make believe games. She is helped along the way by an odd assortment of creatures, but her charm and intelligence sees her through, despite the efforts of the seductive Goblin King.Labrynth encompasses the greatness of fairy tales; the metaphors for the maturing process, the hidden depths of the characters, the primordial terror. It also features the wizardry of the Henson team, with their wonderfully life-like creatures. The muppet feel is at first jarring, but quickly sucks you in. You soon forget they are puppets and think of them as real creatures.Jennifer Connelly makes a spectacular debut as a lead (she had a few films under her belt), definitely hinting at her success to come. She seems equally mature and innocent, and is a vision of youthful beauty. David Bowie is the perfect choice for the Goblin King; a unique presence, seductive and repellent. The various character performers give full personalities to their puppets, allowing you to forget that they are puppets.The music is memorable, although a few pieces can be a bit annoying. Some of Bowie's music doesn't quite work, but it does mesh with the story.Labrynth is a wonderful fantasy film and a great family film. There are real scares throughout, but also memorable characters and engaging music. This is the type of family entertainment that inspires youthful imagination, rather than just providing a diversion for and hour or so.",Labyrinth

A true original in the vein of Alice in Wonderland, this surreal, enchanting story is a real marvel to behold.A film that blurs the line between reality and illusion, our heroine Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is far more interested in fantasy lands and far off places than dealing with solid reality and her impending womanhood.The one thing she hates most is babysitting her brother Toby. When she can't stand it any longer, she makes a wish to Jareth, the Goblin King, to take Toby away. What Sarah doesn't realise is the Goblins are listening in, and she finds her wish granted.Sarah's fantasy world has now become a frightening reality, especially when Jareth (David Bowie) appears right before her eyes. When she pleads for Toby's return, Jareth sets her a task. If she wants Toby so badly, she'll have to get him back herself, from Jareth's castle at the centre of a deadly labyrinth.With only 13 hours, Sarah must brave the insidious tricks, impossible conundrums and bizarre creatures to solve the labyrinth. These are all delivered from Jim Henson's production company, where he really allows his imagination to conjure a visual treat.There is so much to see in this film. Wonderful sights, minute details, impressive settings, especially the Goblin City. You'd need to watch this film several times to take in the sheer amount of visual detail and magnificent splendour that went into the making of Labyrinth.I can only imagine how long it must have taken Jim Henson and Co to create such a surreal and inventive world. And that includes the puppetry and animatronic effects. Hordes of Goblins, the cowardly Hoggle, the misunderstood Ludo, and the over-brave Sir Didymus. Each one with their own unique personality. Not since Gremlins have I seen such amazing puppetry put to such engaging effect. The painstaking amount of effort that went into this film is incredible. Of course today it would all be done with CGI, which shows how lazy film-makers have gotten over the years. Although the breathtaking MirrorMask is an exception to that rule, and shows how CGI can be used in the fantasy genre when done correctly. Sarah and Jareth are the human element. Sarah does a lot of growing up when dealing with the Labyrinth's many enigmas, such as enchanted door knockers, helping hands, and the infamous Bog of Eternal Stench. Although Jennifer Connelly is occasionally a bit on the bland side, she holds her own, and interacts with the puppets believably.As for David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, although he has questionable taste in wigs, I liked his performance. He could have hammed it up like Jeremy Irons in Dungeons & Dragons, but instead he makes for an impressive villain. I love the way he manipulates those crystals, and some of his songs are really catchy. He looks right at home here. With his fright wig and mismatched eyes, he doesn't look much different from the puppets he's surrounded by!Some scenes are a bit pointless like Sarah at a masquerade ball and in a junk yard. Although they're great to look at, I'm not sure what they add. They might have something to do with Sarah's growing up from the fantasy world she prefers to hide in, but the film could have done just as well without them.But Labyrinth has a real rip-roaring finale in the Goblin City, filled with visual invention of the highest order. Sarah's defeat of Jareth has got a nice adult edge to it, and the film is capped by a delightful scene at the end where she has a party with all the friends she's made.An undeserved failure when it came out, Labyrinth will always be one of my all time favourites.So whenever you're feeling down, lose yourself in Labyrinth.",Labyrinth

95,supertom-3,"Fantastic, magical movie!!",10,18 July 2003,"This is a classic fantasy film from Jim Henson, in collaboration with George Lucas. There really is a magic about the film and that has helped it last as a firm family favourite all these years. As with many films aimed at younger audiences there are messages that the writers, in this case Henson himself, have tried to convey, such as `be careful what you wish for (as in the heat of the moment we are not always sure what is best for us) and also about not taking things for granted. These lessons not only relate to the major target audience of young children but also teenagers and adults alike. The film also has values and attitudes about growing up, the central character Sarah is in the awkward stage between child and womanhood, the stage of adolescence. She acts like a child in her self importance and possessiveness but she is perhaps starting to grow out of her young imagination. She does not want to, her room full of inanimate companions, dreams and fantasies, she feels are slipping away.Labyrinth is about Sarah keeping her imagination alive, her fantasies and dreams, and these help her figure out what she is doing wrong, it helps her realise how her attitude is wrong and causes her to be depressed. There is certainly intelligence to this film if analysed deeply. There is depth to the script, and clear attitudes and values that Jim Henson conveys. Henson is in a way telling not just kids, but also adults, that our subconscious, which includes our dreams and imaginative side (in terms of taking yourself to another place, more than imagination in creating something like a piece of music for instance.) can be as affective a guide to where and when your live is going wrong as your conscious. Sometimes we don't realise things we have said or done until we dream. How many times have you said something, that every teen must have to their parents, for instance `I wish you were dead', very cruel but it is said. I have in the past and realised the full implication in a bad dream, a dream is the most effective doorway to imagine something outside of it really happening. What is fantastic about the way the film opens and closes as that it really hints to the fact that Sarah has been through the same dream before, and that she needs these imaginative friends, and dreams to help her see the light as it were. She says for instance at the close that every now and again she needs Hoggle and company. The opening of the film sees Sarah reciting from a book to herself, she is addressing the Goblin king and the characters of this book and her room are the cast of a play inside her mind, they are special to her and meaningful, in a way we might have a favourite song that speaks to us in some way. At the start of the film when we are first in her room there is clever use of visual hints that you wouldn't pick up on until watching a film the second time. Look around her room and you see the characters everywhere, Hoggle, Ludo even a little replica of a maze. There is also a clipping of Sarah's mother, who we do not know whether she is still alive, but in any case is not around, but she is with a man who is the likeness of the Goblin King. The man in the photo probably a figure of blame for the loss (however large) of Sarah's mother. What is also interesting is Sarah being a young girl at the start of puberty has a certain fascination and perhaps crush on the Goblin King, perhaps a combination of the character from the book and the likeness of which she has created this character in her head. Certainly on a visual and script basis there are some clever touches when you consider this is a kids film. The film itself is much like the Wizard of Oz in terms of story (intentional maybe as it could represent something that Sarah finds special and perhaps inspirational). What I really love about the film is, that before the days of CGI, inside the Goblin world, which accounts for 90% of the film, everything is 100% set work, there must be well over a hundred sets and they are all imaginative an create the enchanting atmosphere of the film, these sets combined with some fantastic matte paintings from ILM that give even more of a scale to the film.I do really like this film, the look, the cheesy feel good 80's music, the characters, it is all great. There is some good humour and of course the odd piece of very childish low brow humour but that is to be expected. It is movie magic no question. David Bowie is good as the Goblin King and all the puppeted characters are fantastically brought to life in there movements and voicing as you would expect from a Henson film. A very youthful Jennifer Connelly before the days when many a website was devoted to her ample bosom, has a charm to her, she has to hold the movie together and win the audience, especially after being very bratty and effectively wishing her baby brother into the clutches of Goblins. She does manage to win the audience though and enchant them with her green eyes and youthful innocence.This film is great, it is what makes, or made fantasy films of this time really enchanting. Real artistry was involved, there was exuberance and charm to it and it has lasted a long time. It is a firm fans favourite and still gains new young fans. I can still to this day sit down and enjoy the film because I remember what Jim Henson tries to teach us. `Keep the inner child alive inside you sometimes he/she actually knows best'. Perhaps certain events in recent years may have panned out differently had this been heeded by more people, but that is all just hear say.Overall this is a classic fantasy film with much artistry and charm to appreciate, certainly Henson had a skill in all his fields in the industry. ****",Labyrinth
96,RiffRaffMcKinley,Tight-Garbed Glam Rock Meets Sword-and-Sorcery Cinema... Curiously Good,8,31 August 2007,"The genius of Jim Henson lives on in innumerable places. ""Labyrinth,"" while not one of the greatest of his oeuvre, is still a gem (though a slightly tarnished one) full of memorable animatronic creatures and the late Henson's consistent ingenuity.Jennifer Connelly pouts and whines her way through her performance as Sarah, a spoiled teen who must rescue her baby brother after wishing that goblins would come and kidnap him. Which they did, led by goblin king Jareth (David Bowie, who, unfortunately, sings).Early in the journey, she meets a goblin named Hoggle who helps her on a trek fraught with peril and that-wasn't-there-a-minute-ago puzzles. Along the way, she meets Ludo, a shy demon, and a delusional knight named Sir Didymus. Meanwhile, Jareth gives Sarah a deadline to rescue little Toby before he becomes one of them... forever!The performances are not that good, and the songs are cringe-worthy, but the film is still full of magic and fun. The magic is provided by Henson and his highly skilled creature performers, while the fun is provided by both co-writer Terry Jones (yes, Terry Jones of Monty Python fame) and cinematic wizard George Lucas. ""Labyrinth"" is, almost rightfully so, a very popular film. Feast your eyes... but maybe not your ears... on it.",Labyrinth
97,La Gremlin,"It's starting to sound like a broken record, but you're going to love this movie!",10,6 August 2000,"I recently had the pleasure of watching this movie with three kids who had (to my shock and dismay) never seen it before. It turned out to be as good, if not better, as I remembered. The story is reminescent of the original, printed page (very dark) Grimm fairy tales. The special effects are still special, and the characters are unforgettable. Seriously, don't miss it.This is one of the very few childrens' movies that is smarter and better than what has unfortunately become ""normal"" for the genera. The reverse evolution in childrens' films is heartbreaking, as kids don't deserve to be talked down to so often in movies. I grew up on films like ""Labyrinth"", ""the Neverending Story"", and ""the Secret of NIMH"", and I still count them among my favorites. In the 80's they gave us cinematic filet mignon, and today's kids are getting Spam.",Labyrinth

99,Aly200,"Quite Silly, but Loaded with Heart and Whimsy",8,19 August 2016,"If someone where to mention the title ""Labyrinth"" to you, maybe the image of late singer-actor David Bowie in this film would come to mind. Directed by the late creator of ""The Muppets"" Jim Henson and starring Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King and fresh-faced newcomer Jennifer Connolly as teenage heroine, Sarah, this fantasy film is chuck full of fantastical characters and wacky songs.As the film's antagonist, David Bowie is at his flamboyant best as the menacing, yet amusingly charming Goblin King. His mere presence makes you wait for what Bowie will utter either in speech or in song. He is so cartoonish in concept, but devilish in his schemes to trap Connolly's Sarah in his titular 'Labyrinth'. In addition to being the leading man, Bowie demonstrates his originality in songwriting as he penned every song for the film and performs all but one number; reminding us why he is still one of the best singers of all time (even posthumously) and how catchy the tunes Bowie wrote are. I dare you not to start singing or dancing to Bowie's fanciful lyrics and choreography.Playing the (at first) bratty, but loyal and brave Sarah demonstrates the raw talent that future Oscar winner Jennifer Connolly had at her disposal. She is virtually unlikable in the film's start as her selfish teenage attitude exudes a loathsome persona. However Connolly's switch to heroine is believable as her character undergoes a transformation throughout the film as Sarah must face each challenge that Bowie's Jareth lays out for her. Sarah soon becomes a likable strong female as she learns to work with her compatriots (the cowardly Hoggle, the kind behemoth Ludo and the wily, overly confident Sir Didiymus) to solve the labyrinth and retrieve her baby stepbrother from the Goblin King.The creatures created by the Henson Creature Shop are as fantastical as the film's villain. In a world populated primarily by goblins, but also with birdlike and massive mammalian beings too, it's like a child's fantasy novel come to life. The puppeteers (many are familiar faces to another who knows ""The Muppets"") provide the added camp factor by playing laughably fun characters that all have life of their own. An enjoyable movie for all ages and guaranteed that you will be grooving to the music and singing too.",Labyrinth
100,antagonist117,"Bowie is game, but the rest is ponderous",4,17 June 2013,"David Bowie contributes some catchy tunes, and he's definitely game for his role as The Goblin King, a creepy figure with a glam rocker's hair and unexplained motivations. Apart from Bowie's scenes, however, the film lacks energy. There is hardly any atmospheric music, little dialogue other than the repetitive and expository kind, and the characters move painstakingly slowly on what appear to be flimsy sets. Labyrinth follows the template of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and contains some visual homages to that film, but the titular maze never attains the sense of place that Oz has. Jennifer Connolly's Muppet co-stars do not pop like Dorothy's companions or like Henson's more charismatic creations. ""Labyrinth"" has some of the ineffable appeal that cult movies acquire when they strive to be great and distinctive but instead turn out flawed and distinctive, but its script and production are just too hollow to mark it as a noble or notable failure.",Labyrinth
101,gareth-75442,Superb kids movie,10,10 October 2020,"Comical how 34 years after this movie was released reviewers on here are panning it, as a children's movie this may have been a box office flop but it's years ahead of anything that's been released as a kids movie in the last couple of decades, you just have to look at the unimaginative drivel on offer today",Labyrinth
102,Spideyfan-963-246215,Labyrinth (1986),10,15 November 2017,"Labyrinth (1986) Starring: David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, Toby Froud, Shelly Thompson, Brian Henson, Ron Mueck, Frank Oz, Shari Weiser, Christopher Malcolm, Dave Goelz, David Barclay, David Shaughnessy, Karen Prell, Timothy Bateson, Rob Mills, Warwick Davis, and Natalie Finland Directed By: Jim Henson Review WHERE EVERYTHING SEEMS POSSIBLE AND NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS. Apparently this film failed at the box office, I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it could of been due to the fact that it's very lighthearted. But since its release on Video and its many re- releases on DVD & Bluray it has gained a cult following. Frustrated with babysitting on yet another weekend night, Sarah – a teenager with an active imagination – summons the Goblins from her favorite book, ""Labyrinth"", to take the baby stepbrother away. When little Toby actually disappears, Sarah must follow him into the world of the fairy-tale to rescue him from the Goblin King! George Lucas had hand in not just as an Executive produce but also had a hand with the shooting script for this film. He did a lot of other great works after Star Wars (this and Willow) but he must of lost his way with films like The Phantom Menace and that Indiana Jones movie that will never be spoken of. Terry Jones from the Python group had written a script that was much different from what Lucas, Henson and Laura had in mind. But many changes were made because of the star of the movie, David Bowie. The director of photography Alex Thompson made another beautiful looking movie that went along with Brian Foud's production design. Alex Thompson had worked on Legend before hand which is my favorite fantasy film it's a no wonder this film's photography look just as amazing. The opening credits with CGI owl was impressive at the time, but now it just feels like a cheap effect. They're are even some scenes were you can just tell it's green screen. The puppeteers crafted some amazing work with their most notable one's being the characters of Hoggle, Ludo, and Didymus. Jennifer Connelly had only done a few commercials before working on this film, I just took a look at her audition tape for the film and I can see why she got this role. She got cast not only because of how good she was but because Henson thought Jennifer was a girl growing out of her childhood. In the film you can see that Sarah's character is trying to hold on to her childhood with stuffed animals being shown almost all over her room. Jennifer was only fourteen at the time. My favorite moments are when she's interacting with Hoggle, Ludo and Didymus and the ballroom scene if only for the sheer reason because she looks like a beautiful princess. David Bowie not only delivers an amazing performance for the movie but provided it with a pretty good soundtrack. He did four tracks Underground, As The World Falls Down, Magic Baby and within you. The two I most enjoyed were ""As The World Falls Down"" and ""Underground"". Magic Dance is another good one I believe a lot of you will enjoy just depends on taste I have a very strange taste in music. Labyrinth is a delightful little children's film that is much better than most and has great acting, music, direction and puppeteer work. The film doesn't have the best story or even use of CG, but it still holds a place as an amazing fantasy musical and children's film. I'm giving Labyrinth a ten out of ten because of how much I enjoyed the film and is definitely very re-watchable.",Labyrinth

105,David_Frames,Disturbing,8,30 January 2005,"Labyrinth's appropriation of fairy-tale storytelling seems unsettling when the films true meaning is established. It's a celluloid Trojan horse that purports to tell the tale of young girl who looses her baby brother to an evil 'Goblin king' who imprisons said child at the centre of a enchanted labyrinth, giving her a mere 13 hours to find him or loose him. Thats the plot but not alas, the story. This is movie about the insidious, sexually deviant desire of an older man to covet a teenage girl and the lengths to which he's prepared to go to confuse her to achieve his aims, utilising no less than drugs, potions and hypnosis. When Sarah looses her baby brother she has in effect, lost the innocence he symbolises. We can infer that Jareth (David Bowie) has already corrupted her at this stage - the sexual attraction between them is obvious, though he is skillful in the way he intimidates her and subordinates her to achieve his goals. When he first reveals himself to the would-be princess, he is clad in revealing tights and engages in ball play before unleashing a 'snake' on the inawed 15 year old. Henson's film could stop there but goes further as Sarah looses herself within Bowie's intricate web of confusion, bumping into a series of unpleasant leering males on the way, the dirty old man, the bestially-biased fox and the hairy muscle bound simpleton - all too happy to tag along but undoubtedly following Jareth's lead, the fairytale version of an internet commune. There's more - the songs with talk of 'love injections' and putting that babies spell on me not to mention ""magic dancing"". The date rape sequence in which Bowie attempts to close the deal with a toxic peach and the climatic attempt at psychological manipulation in which Sarah's riposte that 'you have no power over me' represents the ultimate rejection of his attempt at sexual domination. In the lead Jennifer Connelly is wanton and virginal, the perfect foil for Bowie's inappropriate overtures. It is suggested that the absence of her real mother has made her more vulnerable to would-be predators, and the movie's resolution in which Sarah is surrounded by fantasy characters as the owl (Bowie) leers at her outside before beating off into the night, tells us that the gap between innocence and desire is sometimes just a pane of glass...or a complex series of hedge rows.",Labyrinth
106,Gunn,The Cream of the Henson/Muppet Co.'s Crop!,10,14 October 2009,"As I stated before, I love the two Henson/Muppet films, The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. Labyrinth is by far the better film. Its plot is a variation of the quest movie genre. The fact that its hero is a young girl, and the quest involves the kidnapping of her baby brother is definitely a new twist. Again Jim Henson's creativity is the main ""star."" The visuals and art direction are so stunning and creative as are the characters. The story is refreshingly new, the music score and songs by Trevor Jones and David Bowie are wonderful. The acting by a young Jennifer Connelly and surprisingly David Bowie as the Goblin King are excellent. My favorite ""Dance, Magic, Dance"" works so well with the characters and the choreography. Connelly plays Sarah, a kind of self-centered teen initially, who wishes her baby brother, whom she has been told to babysit, would just disappear. Unfortunately, the Goblin King, hears her and grants her wish. When she tells him she didn't really mean it, he tells her that she has until midnight to rescue him from his castle, which is surrounded by a huge, twisting Labyrinth. Many lessons are learned along the quest. What a journey director Henson and co-writers Dennis Lee, Elaine May, and Monty Pythonite Terry Jones take us on. This is their Masterpiece to date!",Labyrinth

This might be the worst film that I have ever seen. I understand that there is a cult following of Labyrinth that holds the film in high esteem. I assume that it is because of childhood nostalgia or a love of David Bowie, but I am not on the same page.Labyrinth honestly felt like the creepy love child of a bad stage adaptation of The Wizard of Oz and a disturbing episode of Barney featuring David Bowie. I thought that 16-year-old Jennifer Connelly did a fine job, and the puppeteering was high quality, but the film in its entirety was just laughably bad. The flatulent rocks were painful to watch, the finale was underwhelming and whoever approved Bowie's horrific tights deserves to find another career.Labyrinth is too scarring for children, too childish for adults and is an all-around awful film.

I'm going 2 go through everything right now.First off, the casting of this film is terrific, we have David Bowie who adds a lot of humor and dark humor to the film, Jennifer Connelly as the sweet and saving Sarah and then Brian Henson voicing and controlling the tempered troll Hoggle. All of the other cast and back up actors also acted very well.The music is outstanding and very stunning and it jumps out at you. Definitely a change of music, not like the Dark Crystal's soundtrack which was full of disturbance, darkness and suspense. I feel the music in this was more adventurous and funny.The landscaping, back drops and background designing was formatted well and like Dark Crystal, it was very real life like and creatures and characters adding to that were very affective.Overall Labyrinth is a fun and very fantasy alternative ride which all will enjoy. Those who have seen Dark Crystal before this should give Labyrinth a try because Labyrinth seems to bring something very, very different to the table.8/10",Labyrinth

Muppets are insuferable.,4,10 June 2007,"Let me just start by saying that I'm a Bowie fan but did not grow up with this movie, and have no nostalgia bias.I like Bowie, but the rest of this movie was nigh-insufferable. Were Muppets some kind of fad/fetish back in the 80s? Cause I haven't seen an 80s kids film that didn't have them.David Bowie kind of struts his thing as a glam rocker for his scenes (of which there are too few. He's easily the most interesting character in the damn movie) He's in an awful wig and wails out some interesting non-sequiter songs, but it never really feels like there's a match of wits going on with witless Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), who just really wasn't much of an actress back then. Right after the first few scenes where she overacts and shouts I went ""Oh s***. What have I done?"" There are some interesting concepts (The stairway thing at the end. Some bits of magic.) but it's lost next to the screaming awful muppets. Does anyone find them cute or funny? It's the same damn problem I had with ""Gremlins"". The cartoon violence is lame. Most of the movie was lame and I just had to fast forward through the flamingos.For everyone that didn't find the majority of Muppets Christmas Carol (minus Patrick Stewart) insufferable.

Titles like The Neverending Story, Flight of the Navigator and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? captured my imagination and filled me with aw, and with time found their way to my ever growing DVD collection, as did Jim Henson's Labyrinth, the latest addition to my nostalgic bundle of joy.The saddest thing about all this is that no one seems to make films like Labyrinth anymore. Viewing it again at the age of 25 just made me appreciate it even more, for all of it's breathtaking imaginative figures, rich scenery and original plot; especially when some of the scenes seem somewhat dated while the essence and heart of the film remain in tact, even twenty years down the road.In short, Labyrinth is one of Jim Henson's last attempts at creating cross-age entertainment through his world famous puppets, after bringing life to the eternal beloved characters of The Muppets and Sesame Street, and before his sudden and premature death. The story presents us 16 year old Sarah (a very young Academy Award winner Jennifer Connelly, A Beautiful Mind), who has an extremely vivid imagination she uses to escape her everyday worries... or so it seems. After asked to take care of her baby stepbrother, Toby, Sarah finds herself dealing with a screaming infant, instead of wondering away in her thoughts to a world filled with Goblins, Yeti-like creatures, and a King Atrhur-ish talking dog. After several lacking attempts at calming the baby down, she wishes Toby to the evil Goblin King Jareth. Fantasy and fiction clash when Jareth (the one and only rock singer David Bowie, who appears on screen with an extravagant 80's outfit and some cute yet unnecessary songs) actually takes Toby away to his evil kingdom, where he threatens to transform the baby into a Goblin, if Sarah won't find a way to cross a tricky and mystical Labyrinth on the way to his kingdom.

114,wandereramor,David Bowie! Jennifer Connelly! MUPPETS!,8,5 June 2012,"By the time I reached the scene where Jennifer Connelly fights David Bowie inside a M. C. Escher painting, I fully understood why Labyrinth has become a cult classic.The movie follows the usual conventions of children's movies, with a conventional story arc and almost laughably obvious moral, but there's a kind of strangeness to it that belongs as much to Henson as it does to Bowie. The labyrinth itself, which seems to operate under the magic realist rules of something like The Phantom Tollbooth (a children's classic if there ever was one), and all the creatures within it are filled with humour and invention. They're funny but they aren't jokes, and that helps for the more serious scenes. The whole thing is rooted on this same slipperiness between language, reality, and fantasy.Of course, it should be noted that this is firmly a children's movie, and not in the Pixar ""fun for adults too!"" camp. Honestly, I think this is to its credit -- the lack of any sort of wink to a more knowing audience is endearing. This is a film that believes in its own earnestness, and never feels like a cynical product. At the same time, it does make some parts a bit tiresome or wince-inducing for an adult audience, but it really isn't for us. It's for overly precocious children who will probably grow up to have weird sexualities and tastes in music. God bless them.",Labyrinth

Meeting many strange, weird, and wonderful characters along the way, she struggles to reach the centre of the maze.Opening with an exterior scene in which our heroine attempts to comprehensively quote a scene from a book, Labyrinth swiftly introduces us to her love of the fantastical. Soon after, she is home and being chastised for her lateness, putting her in a foul mood. This is not conducive to her appreciation of her baby brother, who cries relentlessly when she takes a teddy bear from him which he has somehow managed to get from her room. This early scene introduces us to one of the film's most enduring and detractive faults: the fact that the protagonist is largely unlikeable. Her impatience with the baby serves to show her as an inconsiderate, selfish, and immature young brat. Little is done to endear us to her, even throughout the rest of the film. She seems to learn little from her experience; a slight moment of humanity in the final scene not nearly enough to make up for the less amiable aspects of her personality. The problem of Sarah aside, the film's plot itself is sufficiently engaging. The fantasy world of the Labyrinth is amusing, entertaining, and very well realised. Henson's characters are each in their own ways funny, intriguing, and likable. One complaint, however, is regarding Jareth. It's always bothered me to have the Goblin King as a six foot tall human, especially in the way that this is never referred to or apparently noticed by anyone. This is, however, rather a minor concern. Bowie leads the musical numbers well, bringing much to the entertainment factor of this fine children's film.Though its central character lacks the moral development and evolution which might lend gravitas to the film's effect, Labyrinth is a perfectly entertaining film. Certainly more for the enjoyment of children, it doesn't quite do a huge amount for adults.",Labyrinth
116,TheEtherWalk,One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen,4,15 November 2002,"After seeing this movie, I had a lot of questions. How do they explain that the girl has a goblin king living behind her house in a gigantic maze? Where did this maze come from? Is it just there, or did it appear when she wished her brother gone? A lot of this movie does not make any sense. Sure it's a fantasy, but what about the part where she walks through the wall? If she didn't see the opening then she must have no depth perception at all.
This movie is jaw-droppingly stupid, and the only part I liked at all was the battle they had with the goblins. 2/10",Labyrinth

This movie's captivating, a true fantasy classic with a romantic twist in it.  What I love about it too is that I can in many ways relate to our lovely heroine, Sarah.  She has lots of dreams which seem to be impossible to come true through the ordinary eye, but she knew that deep down in her heart, they could.  This is a wonderful movie, and I don't think I know one person in the world who didn't see or dislike this movie.  David Bowie was THE PERFECT rock star to play the Goblin King - other options were Sting (which wouldn't be a bad choice either), Mick Jagger (sorry, I can't picture it!), and Michael Jackson (what was Jim Henson thinking when he thought about putting Michael Jackson in this movie???).The movie set doesn't look like a movie set at all...it's very life like. I LOVE the style of the whole Labyrinth that surrounds Jareth's castle and the Goblin City.  I love the beautiful ball room where Sarah dances with Jareth - VERY VERY ROMANTIC!!! AHHHHHHH!Brian Froud is one of my favorite artists of all time, and I think that his work on illustrating the Goblins, the masquerade masks, and all the other strange and fascinating characters in this film was pure magic!  The movie itself is very magical itself!I say that this is THE best fantasy film of all time.  I miss Jim Henson very much.  Jim Henson is truly one of the greatest film makers of all time, and I still adore his work and his creativity.  His son, Brian Henson, is doing an excellent job keeping Jim's visions alive!!! :o)Labyrinth is the bomb, and truly one of the greatest films every made!!! :o)",Labyrinth

It's a terrific film for children and adults. David Bowie stole the show as the charismatic and musically incline goblin king. If you enjoy fantasy or just want something a little different or if you just like Glam Rock this is for you. With six songs by Rock legend David Bowie Labyrinth is one of the most wonderful fantasy films of it's or any time.The film should appeal to the child inside. It's ideal if you're a David Bowie, Jim Henson, George Lucas or Brian Froud fan. Froud's artist hand in the movie has it's effect through the whole production. The movie has charm and meaning.

To me, it is a good movie, nothing more, nothing less.The visuals were good, the Labyrinth looked believable and the puppets looked very detailed and life like. The soundtrack was good too, thought they did break out into songs quite a bit.The only problem I had with this movie was the story and some of the characters. At least in the Dark Crystal, you could feel sympathy for what Jen and Kira had to go though. And the Skeksis were actually evil and meanacing, and not moronic. But I had a hard time feeling bad for Sarah. She is a snotty, crybaby little ***** and deserved what was coming to her. The goblins were not even scary or menacing at all. They came off as a bunch of circus clowns. And don't get me started with the Goblin King. Though I liked his character, IMO, he looked more bizarre than sexy.Labyrinth is a good movie, but not as splendid as a lot of people make it out to be.Well, at least IMO, Labyrinth is more entertaining than the Harry Potter series (Then again, I think washing dishes is a lot more entertaining than the Harry Potter series).",Labyrinth
125,SimonD1900,Favorite movie of all time!,10,5 September 2019,"Well, I just felt like I hade to praice this movie as well. It has high nostalgical value to me but it's also a very uniq and good film that's almost better to watch today. Sure, a kids movie (that I loved and got freaked out by as a kid) but it has enough ""meat in the stew"" to be a movie for anyone with a bit of imagination and perhaps somewhat wacky mind.It's a charming movie. The humor is on point. The character are amazing and the movie is full of them, they're very likeable and they have toons of character even though they are mere puppets.
Young Jennifer Connelly does a fantastic job, and she really has too, for besides David Bowie she is the only human in the movie. She acts with a lot of expressions on her face and emotions in her eyes, that match every scenario perfectly.
And to see Bowie have so much fun is great, he's presences is magical and shines through the screen, now after his death it has even more meaning. The songs which he conjured up for this movie is very catchy and entertaining.Now, what this movie also has, is real good life messages, that anyone can have use for, it's actually really simple but uplifting. Like for example; it's about that you can make mistakes out of emotions, but the possibility to redeem yourself. It's about not giving up even though you get obstacles in your way and there will be those trying to disscuraged you, that life might test you and it's about pressing on, using your wits, guts and everything you can do. That you might sometimes feel stuck, but that doesn't always mean that you actually are stuck, maybe you are on the exact perfect path that you should be on. It's also about helping others and accepting and asking help from others. And it's about friendship love and loyalty.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie. It's an absolut gem.

Hover since then I find the singing was not done very well, Bowie was very lethargic and too laid back and his acting skills a little suspect. Overall the story was a little boring, or at least presented that way.I know people are supposed to love babies, but personally I found all the crying enough to make me ask for a Goblin King to come take ME away. I found this part of the story a little silly, but then most of the movie was.

130,sc8031,Pretty Good....For a Girl! AHAHAHAHA!,6,17 June 2008,"Jim Henson's movies always suffer from slow or boring plots. The characters and stories are lovable, and the sets and costumes are out-of-the-ballpark mad-awesome. Yes, these sets and costumes are the stars of the show, but the plots and dialog tend to be a bit lacking.I kinda like the image of wholesome empowerment for young ladies (a la Miyazaki) that exudes from this movie. Here we have Jennifer Connelly (Yowza!), a little lady who doesn't like her brother, so she wishes for goblins to take him away. And so they do, and she has to fight her way through David Bowie's crazy dreamworld to get him back. Supposing she gets him back at all! *bites nails* The song David Bowie sings when he finally makes his big appearance is truly, depressingly bad. Jeebas, you'd think they could've written something really rockin' for the big showdown. Wasn't Tangerine Dream on every film maker's speed dial in the 1980s? (rhetorical question) TD did soundtracks to movies called Sorceror and Thief. Considering this movie is about both sorcerors and thieves and Jennifer Connelly, TD would've fit right in. Oh well. *sigh* To me, Jim Henson's stuff shone brightest when someone else was writing the dialog. The man was a true gem in the world of special effects and ambiance. Too bad nobody makes 'em like this anymore. People jest don't got tha guts!",Labyrinth

135,antonjsw1,"Interesting, complex but slightly muddled movie",6,13 November 2010,"This is an interesting, multi-layered complex film about coming of age for a teenage girl. However, the film is uncertain what audience it is aiming at, and as a result the tone is muddled with darker aspects meshing uncomfortably with cheerful scenes clearly aimed at much younger children. The lack of clarity is the films main failing, coupled with some inconsistent acting by a young Jennifer Connelly, inconsistent special effects and poor sets mean that the film is definitely inferior to Henson's previous effort, the excellent Dark Crystal.The plot is interesting, multi-layered and complex, but is slightly undermined by some interludes that seem totally out of place and tonally very different. This mainly is around some of the musical numbers, some of which work very well, and some that did not. When the main plot is focused upon the film performs. The story looks at the needs and desires of a frustrated teenager, played by experienced young teenage actress Jennifer Connelly. She had a number of films already under her belt when she was cast in this film. The structure of the film leaves what is real and imagined open to interpretation by the audience. However, this clever ambiguity is undermined somewhat because the film doesn't quite know what it is as an overall experience: is it a dark fantasy, comedy, or fairy tale? Connelly's performance at the start of the film is uncertain, too broad and played with a lack of subtlety. However as the film goes on, she her performance improves and during a surreal venetian ball she has a highly effective non verbal confrontation with the Goblin King (a solid performance by David Bowie), and hints that the character is moving into a sexual awakening at this point, but then decides she is not ready for this, and makes a decision not to pursue this. It is at this point she is beginning to show the potential as a very talented actress that eventually led to a highly successful career leading to an Oscar for best supporting actress for the film a Beautiful Mind.Technically the film is well put together, with some clever visual effects, especially towards the film's climax. Some of the animatronics are highly effective, particularly in the film's major battle sequence. The creations of Hoggle and Ludo are real standouts and those characters are interesting and draw the viewers interest. However some of the other work looks like puppets and undermines the suspension of disbelief. Production design by Eliot Scott is solid, albeit some sets work very well, and some sets unfortunately look like sets. The visual effects range from impressive to satisfactory, the work being split between George Lucas's ILM and Optical Film Effects. David Bowie's tunes work reasonably well with the film, but again the style of some of them seem out of kilter with the story. Nevertheless the film feels reasonably satisfying at the conclusion.Overall an OK film, if slightly unclear at what it's trying to say.",Labyrinth

Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice.""",9,21 October 2019,"Through the years since I was an 8 year old I really have no idea how many times I have seen this Jim Henson classic. I really can't come up any reason why your child or anyone who may be young at heart won't thoroughly enjoy this film. Might even love if you are a fan of The Muppets or Monty Python. Directed amazingly by Jim Henson (who also penned the story with Dennis Lee), executive produced by George Lucas and contains the wonderful wit of screenwriter and Monty Python member Terry Jones. I just saw this for the first time on the big screen yesterday with my fiancee and my sister. There truly is so much to look at and gather on the screen and it is truly sad that this was Henson's final theatrical film and he passed away at the age of 53. Who knows what else he may have created.The story is great as it does not take long maybe 5-10 minutes before you are thrown into another world of excellent fantasy. Its the story of Sarah (truly terrific performance by a teenaged Jennifer Connelly) who is whiny and self-centred. She can't stand that she has to babysit her younger brother Toby (Toby Froud) for the night. So, she calls on the Goblin King (fabulous performance by David Bowie) to take him away and forget about. Yet, Sarah knows she can not just let him take her brother away so she is brought to another world where an immense labyrinth is thrown before her. She is given 13 hours (thanks to Jareth the Goblin King) to solve the labyrinth and get her brother back or he will turn into a goblin. Along the way she continues to meet wonderful and crazy characters who are all puppets, like a crotchety dwarf named Hoggle (voiced by Brian Henson), a giant friendly beast named Ludo and a heroic knight who happens to be a fox-terrier named Sir Didymus who was to try and assist her in getting to the castle. Does grab inspiration from other amazing stories like ALICE IN WONDERLAND for example.Of course Bowie sings, too. He wrote five new songs (four of which he sings) for this film and all are top notch great songs. I have the LP which also includes the great score from Trevor Jones and really an awesome album to grab if you are a fan of this film.The puppet work in this film is also quite amazing. I mean yes, some of the effects do scream 80s, but some of it is so much more believable and better than effects we have today. They were effects you could touch and feel and I think that truly transports you right into the movie.What else can I say?

Jareth tells Sarah that she has ""13 hours in which to solve the Labyrinth"", or else her baby brother will become one of them (the goblins) forever.So what does Sarah do, well she decides that no matter what she has to solve the Labyrinth to get her brother back. Aww, what a cute story line, oh did I mention that David Bowie and all his goblin friends, don't want her to get the baby back. Will Sarah solve the labyrinth in time to save Toby? Well, to do it she might need some help along the way, maybe director Jim Henson could send a couple of puppets to help her. What, that's what he does? That's right, there's a bunch of puppets that make this movie excellent. This is the perfect movie for anybody that wants an adventure. It's got everything in it, action, drama and of course yes there is some comedic and also touching moments. There's also an excellent soundtrack featuring songs written and performed by David Bowie himself.So, if your looking for the perfect adventure be prepared to enter, ""The Labyrinth"".

He has a charisma that is ageless and creates a character that no one else could.Not all is great with this movie, however. It doesn't age well, sadly. The music is dated and very 80s. Also, a teenage Jennifer Connelly isn't quite the great actress she would become.

I suspect you have to be a Bowie fan to love it: he is not a great actor and his pants are a bit too thin and his music is a bit forgettable (same melody, uninteresting harmony, strange lyrics that are not that thought or emotion provoking). His hair is fantastic, I give him that, and great make up. I am, obviously, not a huge fan, though for the most part I think he's good and interesting look at and has a very nice voice. So apart from the strange and sudden breaks into songs with questionable lyrics, the film is a great fantasy adventure. It is certainly unique.One important plot point that I wasn't sure about: just what is the GK's motivation? Why does he take babies? What does he do with them? (presumably, turn them into goblins, so all those goblins were babies at some point. Are they immediately turned into mature, older goblins or is there a goblin nursery somewhere? Shouldn't Sarah have taken on a bigger task than to just save her brother, but more like bring the GK down so he cannot steal any babies again?) Most of these questions were fueled by the fact that David Bowie just looked bored and unoccupied sitting on his throne, playing with the cute human baby every time he was on screen... So in this sense, I think the plot and the story are a bit simple. While Sarah does have a story arc (she emotionally grows as a result of her journey), and even Hoggles has an emotional arc (he learns what it means to be a friend), the villain is just one-dimensional and inexplicable.",Labyrinth

146,Duzniak38,A Magical Adventure,10,8 April 2006,"Labyrinth is, no doubt, one of the most outstanding fantasy movies ever made. It is superbly acted throughout, with the wonderful talents of Jennifer Connelly, who plays a spoilt girl called Sarah, who takes too many things for granted. She is very beautiful and such a brilliant actress, and she holds the story together well with her convincing transformation from a young dreamy girl with her head in the clouds, to a mature, unselfish young lady, who learns to become independent. David Bowie is very good as the Goblin King. He plays the villain so well; you don't know whether to love him or hate him. The story unfolds with Sarah wishing her bratty little stepbrother, Toby, away to the Kingdom of the Goblins. However, her wish really is granted, and Sarah then faces the biggest challenge in her life; to complete the Labyrinth surrounding the Goblin Castle, within thirteen hours. If she completes it within the time, she will get Toby back. However, if she doesn't, Toby will be transformed into a Goblin, and will have to live in the Goblin Kingdom for eternity as a slave. With such an inventive and promising plot, they couldn't go wrong. The magic begins from the very start; the magnificent and beautiful set pieces don't fail to dazzle and enchant. The labyrinth itself is definitely a magical experience; full of so many mesmerising sets, such as the bog of eternal stench and the oubliette's. The songs are enjoyable and memorable, and I recommend the soundtrack if you enjoy this film. The whole film is a fantastic visual feast, but the best scene has to be the ballroom masquerade; the costumes, the music, the tone and speed of the whole scene makes it such an unforgettable cinematic experience. The characters we encounter throughout the Labyrinth are a delight, including Ludo the lovable ogre, Hoggle the stubborn and fierce Goblin, and Sir Didymus and his stead Ambrosius. Labyrinth is certainly a magnificent fantasy experience, which will have you nostalgic and will leave you feeling warm inside.",Labyrinth

148,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 4 out of 5,7,8 January 2003,"Labyrinth was made in 1986, yet the passage of time hasn't dimmed the spectacular demesne that unfolds before the viewer's eyes.  The real world is quickly left behind as we follow Sarah - a petulant teenager with a lively imagination - on a quest to save her baby brother from the clutches of the Goblin King.  With the help and hindrance of sundry fantastical dwarves, goblins, beasts, and the ilk (brought to life through the puppetry genius of Jim Henson) she has 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth.
Given the talent of Henson, the human actors were always going to face stiff competition.  Jennifer Connelly plays the lovely but perpetually startled-looking heroine (although perhaps she is surprised at the clunky and unlikely dialogue she occasionally spouts).  However the casting agents were spot on in their choice of the deliciously androgynous and mocking David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King.  
But the real stars of the show are the denizens of the labyrinth.  These range from the simple yet visually effective 'helping hands', to huge hirsute beasts, to a goblin army, and some funky fire-dancers.  Similarly impressive is the interior of the Goblin King's castle, which is a replica of the famous optical illusion involving staircases that appear to float in mid-air and connect to each other at impossible angles.
Although there is some bad dubbing and a seemingly endless number of what must be the fakest polystyrene rocks ever to have graced the silver screen, this only minimally dilutes the viewing pleasure.  Labyrinth will reward the spectator (even those who would not class a fantasy film as their normal fare) by transporting them to a captivating world where things are not always as they seem.",Labyrinth

150,ridiculonius,Love it!,10,29 November 2008,"Okay, so this isn't the greatest movie in the world, but for the time it was made the effects are awesome and it definitely gets points for being so great to watch 4 or 5 years after the first time! Jennifer Conelly and David Bowie are magnificent; Jim Henson definitely had a real grasp of the twisted and funny.The movie begins with Sarah (Conelly), a teenage drama queen who is obsessed with fairy tales and costumes. She is fed up with having to baby-sit her baby brother Toby and so, in a fit of rage, wishes out loud for goblins to come and steal away her charge. Of course, the King of the Goblins, Jareth (Bowie) hears her, and actually takes Toby. Sarah begs him to give her brother back and Jareth demands that she first solve his strange and ever-shifting labyrinth to get to his castle before he can give Toby up.Along the way, Sarah meets some weird and wonderful characters, such as Hoggle the grouchy but soft-hearted dwarf, Ludo the gentle giant, and Didymus the ever noble... fox-dog thing (Hoggle is, in my opinion, the best). She discovers that things are not what they seem, not to take anything for granted, and the audience learns that Bowie looks great in tight pants ;). In all seriousness, this is a great, classic fantasy flick that one can enjoy every time one watches it.",Labyrinth

I believe the ""Goofs"": such as Toby the baby being obviously replaced by a doll while being tossed in the air were not really goofs since they clearly owned the tech to make it more realistic. I propose that GRAPHIC scenes were DONE INTENTIONALLY fake to REDUCE THE GORY factor; make it obvious to the young and tenderhearted that no real babies or animals were ever put into danger or injured in any way in the making of this movie. Another example is the Fire Creature popping out his eyes and rolling them as dice, the background is clearly changed during that to show it was fake. This kept the Parental Guidance Rating low, maybe PG instead of PG13. This increases the available audience of viewers.",Labyrinth
152,mar9,Glossy nostalgia for the Puf 'n Stuf generation,6,11 April 2002,"Family pictures are a curious breed, particularly when they aspire to greatness as George Lucas' fantasy ""Labyrinth"" seems to. There is a recipe to making such films, and the recipe is interesting as much for what it includes as for what it leaves out. Being a fantasy family picture, ""Labyrinth"" requires: enough magic to bedazzle the small children, a feisty young hero or heroine, scary monsters, a boo-hiss villain, narrow escapes, and a happy, warm, ending to bring a tear to the eye and prompt a family hug. It must not have: blood, realistic violence or excessive terror.The included elements are there up to a point, and the film is colourful and glossy. Unfortunately, it is also terribly bland. David Bowie's Goblin King (a surprisingly flat performance) is utterly camp and devoid of menace. A bit of sexual tension between Jennifer Connelly's Sarah and Bowie would have helped, any tension at all actually. Sarah's supposed race against time to rescue baby Toby should pile on the suspense. It doesn't. The goblins and beasties should be at least a little scary. They are not. Sorry, Jim Henson's creations are irretrievably cuddly and cute in this film. The deus ex machina Sarah utilises to eventually enter the Goblin King's castle is also a let-down.Without some sort of edge, ""Labyrinth"" falls short of greatness. It remains a curiosity, particularly for those wanting to see Connelly's early career. It is a cinematic pantomime, a feature length H.R. Puf'n Stuf.  It's safe. It's nice. It makes you wonder what it could have been.",Labyrinth

What can I say, I enjoyed it. Jim Henson's 'Labyrinth' has a very unique look from today's perspective. They really don't make movies like this anymore, with puppetry, practical effects and handcrafted sets. Today it would be all CGI and it probably wouldn't have that certain charm that these kinds of movies from the 1980s have. Apart from the great look, the movie has two fine actors to offer. Jennifer Connelly is a joy to watch, as usual, and David Bowie is delightfully shifty as the Goblin King. Furthermore, the songs that Bowie wrote and performed for the soundtrack are all excellent. I don't know what's not to like about the movie. It's adventurous, very funny and touching and deservedly considered a classic.",Labyrinth
155,Kristinartist79,Interesting movie for children who are old enough,10,22 July 2008,"I saw it when I was six and it was a little scary but I understood it and kind of liked it, once I got over the scary part. So I guess it depends on the child. I believe HEnson left this movie for people to interpret in maybe different ways. Some people say the girl was a spoiled brat who learned to think of others. Some say her wish was revealing her hidden fears. I do not think Conolly's character was spoiled or selfish. She was a little immature for a fifteen year old, but at the same time very bright. But like a teenager, she appears self centered on the surface, but when it really mattered, when she was missing somebody she loved, she learned what was really important. I think it also showed her fears like somebody said. Also, her character was kind of a loner, and I think they implied that she had some issues, perhaps with her parents divorcing. Her parents seemed so rapped up in their own lives, going out all the time and hardly paying attention to their children. It did not seem like she had a lot of friends and it seemed she spent most of her free time in a fantasy world, reciting lines from that book. So I think this movie was sort of showing troubles, her fears as and her capability of facing them and how you appreciate somebody you love when they are gone. However, I think he made it evasive so it would be up to the viewer to interpret. The most clear message is how you realize you love somebody when they are lost.",Labyrinth
156,jaredkjacoby,Frighteningly Creative and Cool,7,13 September 2021,"Sarah is struggling to get along with her family and one particular bad day makes her wish the Goblin King would take away her baby brother. She immediately regrets it when the Goblin King, Jareth does just that. To get back her baby brother, Sarah begs Jareth for her brother, only for him to challenge her to get through the Labyrinth and reach his castle in 13 hours. Sarah explores the giant maze to find her sister while encountering many odd creatures along the way.If there is one thing I can say about Labyrinth, it is that it is one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen. Ever single thing about the Labyrinth itself has a weird thing happen on screen. Tame and calmness do not exist here. The scene with The Red Gang just casually lifting their heads off their bodies as a normal thing takes the cake for me. In the end, most of it worked. The movie has a charm about its world and setting. Sure, the film's story and characters are odd to the least, but it is bursting with creativity from both a production standpoint and a world building standpoint. There is plenty of lore to be explored here for a film less than two hours and it is done well.The story is nothing special as it has several fantasy cliches, but it is fast-paced and good-natured. It helps that the characters are likable. I wish there were a few more songs here. They were really catchy. Creepy? Yes. Fun to listen too? Absolutely. While the movie is overall goofy and humorous, it has its dark moments. The scene with the hands freaked me out as well as the scene with the old lady. Imagine being dragged to hell... that is what the former seemed like. Keep in mind, this is a PG film. It's not too dark, but I think younger kids could freak out in a few scenes.I have mixed thoughts on Sarah as a protagonist. On one hand, I think Jennifer Connelly overacted the hell out of this movie. She hams it up in most scenes she is in. It's great for supporting characters, but rough for a main character because it's hard to take her seriously. However, I did like Sarah as a character. While she did need help along the way, she got many things accomplished on her own accord. She even faces Jareth by herself by the end, giving her some strong character development. She also starts out as a bit snooty, but becomes really nice by the end as well. I loved David Bowie as Jareth the king of goblins. He is the most memorable part in the film as he steals every scene he is in. He has charisma, humor, an army of ugly, but adorable goblins, magic and manipulation tactics. He is such a mysterious character too. There are many ways his character could have been interpreted.I like Sarah's friends too. Ludo stands out for his design and friendly personality. He also has a cool ability involving his roar. Hoggle is a well-developed character, but I feel that he got off the hook a bit too easy with Sarah. Then there is Sir Didymus who seems like is going to be a really cool character, but he is by far the least useful member of Sarah's group. They really wasted him here and it makes me sad. I could tell that there was some inspiration from Wizard of Oz with the characters a bit, at least with Ludo and Hoggle on how they are developed. They have low self-esteem, but they develop throughout the movie into stronger characters and overcome their flaws by themselves. The voice acting takes some time getting used too, but it is good and it finds a line between cheesy and seriousness. For the other antagonists, the Junk Lady is by far the scariest person there, though the Red Gang is not far behind. I would expect puppets to truly creep me out as much as they did here.The visuals make this movie the delightful and occasionally frightening acid trip that it is. I just films that use practical puppets and set designs. Everything here just looks real. Even the puppets seem like characters with real feelings. The expressions are too-notch and so are the movements. An example is Hoggle who has genuine expressions of guilt and regret over his actions and the look of fear from the Junk Lady. The puppets have creative designs and impressive expressions. The sets themselves help bring this crazy world to life, especially the Bog of Eternal Stench and Jareth's castle. There are so many times where I just think to myself that I want to step on one of the sets myself. The only bad looking visuals here are the CGI effects that have not aged well at all, but even then, this movie came out when CGI was new. The soundtrack is very '80s and that is what makes it memorable. The musical numbers are incredibly memorable, especially the first one with Jareth and his minions.Labyrinth is not perfect by any means, but it is full of creativity and adventure. It looks great and the story and worldbuilding help overcome the movie's shortcomings. It is one of those movies that has a bit everything. It has comedy, action, drama, heartwarming moments, mystery and even some horror. Bizarre or not, this easily one of the most unique films I have seen. There is nothing like this. There probably never will be a movie that I see that is like this ever again...",Labyrinth
157,flyingamon,Very entertaining,8,17 May 2011,"It's from Jim Henson and it was released 4 years after masterpiece The Dark Crystal. Even with a very different story comparisons between the two movies are inevitably going to be made. The story in Dark Crystal is more elaborate, you get more background information about the characters and the races etc. That doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy Labyrinth, on the contrary but this movie would never be able to beat the Dark Crystal in my opinion. Labyrinth is more light hearted where Dark Crystal had a more serious and dark tone. I particularly liked the part of Didymus being small he thought he could take on a huge army. he did remind me of Reeperjeep from Narnia. Than there was Udo the big hairy monster who was actually fuzzy and adorable. And not to forget Hoggle the grumpy but helpful dwarf who did care more about Sara than he wanted to admit (reminded me of Grumpy in his relationship with Snow White). Labyrinth does have human actors and not only dolls and puppets like in Dark Crystal however the human actors stay limited to Sara, the goblin king and little Toby. Sara played by Jennifer Connolly played this part well. She was first a childlike teenager on the verge of becoming a young woman still being attached to her dolls (materialistic) and fleeing into her favorite fairy tales. After her journey she learned an important lesson. I think that was shown well. Another human part that was executed amazingly was that of the goblin King played by David Bowie. Bowie is a singer and not an actor and it shows when he is singing a song, you can see the performer in him and how he tries to put the attention on him. Although not cruel he is threatening and evil and yes Bowie did this well for a non-actor. His walking on the ceiling part amazed me as a kid, I still love that today.",Labyrinth

It's the kind of film that you can watch endlessly because of how entertaining it is. For kids, the film is an insanely creative adventure that never ceases to amaze. For older audiences, it's an analogy for the coming of age of a young woman that is depicted with startling empathy and maturity.The acting in the film is great, too. Jennifer Connolly does a great job of being the grounding force between all the weirdness on display, and whilst she's certainly not Oscar-worthy, for her young age she's quite impressive. The actors for the puppet manage to communicate a lot of personality and charm with the restrictions they had. But the real scene stealing performance here, is David Bowie as Jareth. He has such gravitas and brings such weight to the role. It helps that his songs numbers in the film are also great.Speaking of which, almost all of the movie's songs are extremely catchy. Obviously the highlight is ""Magic Dance,"" but ""Chilly Down"" and ""Within You"" are both superb. Believe me, these songs will be stuck in your head long after the movie has ended.Overall, Labyrinth is one of the most purely entertaining movies ever made. Its effects are incredibly impressive, even by today's standards. It has a surprising amount of thematic depth. And above all, it is a lot of fun.

Jennifer Connelly in her first role shows the brilliant actress she will eventually become, David Bowie hypnotizes every time he sets foot on-screen, and the Hensen muppets bring more grins and giggles than could possibly be expected in any movie.Unlike Dark Chrystal, which could only truly be enjoyed by those who were fantasy freaks, this one is approachable to almost anyone, whether or not they enjoy fantasy. Unlike the muppet movies, this is its own world, and stands alone in the stable of muppet classics.

After taking a terrible wish, she is forced to undo her own words through actions  complicated ones, at that, that rely on tearing through a web of deceit, a labyrinth of lies.Sarah is forced to make the oddest of acquaintances into friends she can confide in to achieve her goal of getting to the Goblin King's castle. This movie is directed by the superb puppet maestro Jim Henson and produced in part by George Lucasand is definitely worth seeing. If you enjoyed the Neverending Story, or loved any of Henson's Muppets, then this movie will undoubtedly strike your fancy. In a way, since it's a short movie with a lot of colors, it is good for young kidsbut I hesitate saying that since the ideas are more complicated than what is just on the surface.""The Labyrinth?

163,RebelXStar,"It's only forever, not long at all",7,28 April 2016,"Resentful at being made to babysit by her father and step-mother, Sarah - an imaginative but whiny teenage girl - inadvertently wishes her baby brother, Toby into the Labyrinth; a magical world populated by goblins and ruled over by Jareth, The Goblin King, played by the late, great David Bowie. Jareth informs her that unless she can solve the Labyrinth in thirteen hours, Toby will be turned into a goblin, confident that she will be unable to do so.It seems that everything and everyone in the Labyrinth is out to get Sarah and throw her off the scent, so she has to try to befriend the characters she meets in order for them to help her. Among the myriad of colourful creatures there's Hoggle, a troll, Ludo, a hairy beast-monster with the ability to control rocks and Didymus, a feisty, scrappy little dog-knight.Though it has a large following now, I was surprised to learn that Labyrinth was a commercial failure at the time it was released, and it's very hard to pinpoint exactly why. Labyrinth is like Jim Henson's take on the Alice in Wonderland story, with all the imagination and creativity you'd expect from a Henson production and just a hint of sexual awakening/coming-of-age thrown in for good measure. Even when watching as a small child, I picked up on the chemistry between Jareth and Sarah. And noticed Bowie's astonishingly tight pants...In addition to having themes that appeal to both children and adults, Labyrinth shows an immense attention to detail which give it great re-watchability value. Though I've heard many times that Bowie must have done this movie for a quick cash grab, I never got that impression at all. On the contrary, it looks like he was enjoying every minute and is now perhaps one of his most iconic and defining moments of his career, especially to those born in the eighties and after.",Labyrinth
164,Bologna King,Reality vs. Fantasy,8,1 June 2005,"The best children's literature is deep enough that it is really adult literature. The best children's films contain thought-provoking material for adults. This is one of those films.We are introduced to Sarah (played to perfection by Jennifer Connelly--I have never seen a more brilliant representation of a teenaged girl) as a girl whose fantasy life, based on a book ""Labyrinth"", so engages her that she forgets about her babysitting obligations. She views her stepmother as a ""wicked stepmother"" in a fairy tale. Soon she will wish that the goblins (representing her fantasy life) will take away her brother (representing her real-life responsibilities) altogether. As King Lear says, ""That way madness lies."" She enters the fantasy world to recover her reality.What ensues is a lot of fun, and is as amazingly imaginative as one would expect with such names as George Lucas, Jim Henson, Brian Froud and Terry Jones in the credits. The fantasy life, represented by the Goblin King (The understated menace of David Bowie's performance as an actor is underrated) appears as a labyrinth trying to divert Sarah from her goal. The labyrinth becomes less literal as her journey continues and the diversions include a romantic (not sexual) fantasy with the Goblin King and the temptation to lock herself into her room and to keep the world outside.THIS MAY BE A SPOILER: Finally the Goblin King explicitly offers the comfort of abandoning her real-life responsibilities to embrace her fantasy life: ""Obey me, and I will be your slave."" She responds to this paradox by expressly accepting responsibility for her own life. By doing this she has attained adulthood by putting fantasy into perspective. Adulthood does not mean abandoning fantasy (the fantasy characters are still alive) but keeping it in its place; Sarah can now address her duties as a babysitter, a sister and a daughter.END SPOILER The movie would have been much better if the whole ""Magic Dance"" sequence were cut. The song isn't that great, Bowie looks like a git prancing around (spoiling his performance elsewhere), it slows the action down and moves the plot forward not one whit. The ballroom dance segment is also quite long; guys will tire of it much more quickly than girls and young women.Notwithstanding the serious issues dealt with in the film, it is just plain fun. So much attention is paid to details and incidental characters that they steal the show: the next time you feel like you're talking to someone who's asleep, use the line ""It's so stimulating being your hat!""",Labyrinth

It's a wonderful, magical film, that borders itself on the abstract. However, that's just the problem, it BORDERS on the abstract, teases the audience with it and then takes it away. It could have been a much better film had it explored the abstract, if it had dived into it without hesitation and apology. As it stands,it only tantalized viewer s with the promise of the abstract, and little more.The acting is average. There's neither nothing terrible nor incredible about it. David Bowie is an average, although a little odd, villain. Jennifer Conelly is an average heroine. Toby Froud is an average baby. They all do their parts well, but step down to let the film run itself. There's nothing wrong with this, but it leaves me without any comments about the acting other than that, that it was average and non-obtrusive to the story. The same thing can be said for Jim Henson's directing: average and non-obtrusive.There are a lot of things, little things, about this movie that makes it really special. The song David Bowie sings is a classic, especially the beginning (featured in the card game Mow). The puppet animation is a rarity in feature-length films, and is a pleasant addition to this film. I have absolutely nothing against modern special effects, in fact I love them, but it's a nice change of pace to look at Labyrinth and see something more solid... something more old-school and traditional. David Bowie's character is more enjoyable than David Bowie's performance, and is something so intriguingly and wonderfully different than most main-streamed characters that it must be mentioned.This is a wonderful family movie, and one that people of all ages can enjoy. Anybody who's a fan of David Bowie, Jim Henson (especially his work with The Muppets) or 2005's Mirrormask should find this movie especially enjoyable.",Labyrinth

His facial expressions and mannerisms are spot on.Jennifer Connelly is excellent in this and shows both a childish side and a mature side as she progresses through the Labyrinth.And of course the supporting characters such as Ludo and Hoggle are both funny and memorable.Lastly, the music and songs by David Bowie are ALL perfect.

171,Jeope!,David Bowie Changed My Life...And My Hair.,6,14 July 2000,"Looking back at Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth"", my naïveté as a kid must've been in full effect. When the movie debuted, I admit, I was caught smack-dab in the middle of its target audience - as a fairly dumb, imaginative, gawk-in-amazement-at-even-the-shoddiest-special-effects, Muppet-loving, movie-going ten year-old. My mom took me to see ""Labyrinth"" after days of pleading, and with all of my aforementioned attributes in tow, I was not disappointed. But sitting in that theater, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see...David Bowie. I mean, here I was watching this amazingly multi-talented guy act, sing and, AND, defy all laws of gravity by rolling a crystal ball around his hand. Plus he could turn into a barn owl. Way cool. For months following ""Labyrinth"", I wanted to be David Bowie - especially in the hair department. Tina Turner had nothing on this Goblin King, and I was even more astounded a brief time later when I discovered he wasn't even an actor.The movie though, still holds up fairly well, and all the credit in the world goes to Jim Henson for that. One thing was always for certain in the 80s: Muppet technology always remained a step ahead of the visual effects movement. The movie's cast of creature-oddities were far more tactile and believable than anything ""Ghostbusters"" (for example) could ever throw at you. The one F/X stumble even noticeable as a dumb kid in 1986 were those papier-maché boulders. But I digress.This is a movie you should 'see again, for the first time' and all that stuff. Or show to your kids. Or whatever. It's all good, baby.",Labyrinth

Managed to find a copy of it and settled down to watch it, thinking it would all flood back to me... all the happy childhood memories...but it just didn't! Maybe I didn't love it after all.I do believe if you watched this film when you were wee you would like it. It's all good family fun. Girl has to babysit her pest of a little brother... she's into magical fairy tales etc... she rattles off some old saying and the Goblin King (Bowie... which is just too mental!) comes and takes him away to his magical castle in the middle of a maze.I would recommend this if you've got kids etc.... but not one for an adult to sit and watch, you'll just start pulling at all the plot holes and the whole thing will unravel.Poor 4/10 for me..... sorry :-) Dave",Labyrinth
173,Reaper Man,Bowie is God,9,29 August 2000,"Labyrinth is an example of a film that can never be copied, bettered or remade.  Jim Henson (R.I.P) was the master of puppetry and fantasy, and anyone who disputes that fact is a fool.  I don't know anyone who doesn't like this film, and damn right too. Whether they admire it for it's charm, whether it evokes premature nostalgia, or because they love it, it is respected and oft talked about.  So what if we're all 20 year old's with nothing better to do than get pi**ed down the pub and hare about in race-tuned Fiestas?  This film is great anytime, be it a drunken binge, or a night in on your own.  Funny, fashionable, well-made, I cannot fault this film.  Dave is in fine form as the Goblin King, and he sports a thrillback eighties hair-do to boot.  Jesus, I'm going to watch it again, right now.",Labyrinth

She must enter a magical maze and find her brother within 13 hours else he will turn into a goblin forever.The movie has magic, goblins, sweet monsters, greedy dwarfs, fairies and a lot of other strange creatures. Make-up of most of the characters is...well outdated; so is the set design. But Connelly is very pretty and more than makes up for all glitches with her fair act.Watch it for her! 6.8/10",Labyrinth

176,sibelian,An absolute CLASSIC of Children's Fantasy,10,14 October 2006,"Not a foot is put wrong in this masterpiece of modern fairy-tale telling. Every line sings out, every character a gem.Bowie has no talent at all as an actor, but in this he shines out as he's essentially playing some strange personal aspect of himself... He's constructed an excellent villain in this, *how can it be* that he's so effective despite the slight cockney accent, the ridiculous wig and boots, the daft dialogue? Confidence! He throws himself into the part full-tilt and has a ball, and it shows! He LOVES being Jareth, and so Jareth becomes a very lovable villain, vain, pompous, mysterious, never, actually *dark*, you understand...Jennifer Connelly is even better. She IS Sarah.But the real star is the story, which gives Lewis Carroll a fine run for his money, a story full of games and jokes and tricks and a labyrinthine host of delightful minor characters, perfect for a children's story.I think perhaps the two sequences for which I have the greatest admiration are the sequence with the Peach, the Masked Ball and the Junkyard, and...THE BOG OF ETERNAL STENCH! ... which is probably the most GENIUS children's fiction thing EVER.The appeal of this sort of story-writing for kids can't really be pinned down to a formula, you have to have a natural talent for it, and it's clear that the makers of the this movie were completely saturated with this natural talent.A Delight...""SSSHHHHHHH! ....she's going to say the *magic words*...""",Labyrinth

So the only way to get back the little brat is to go through this huge maze. This isn't any ordinary hedge maze... this thing is freaky and full of puppets! Ugly puppets, and most of them are up to no good.

I have printed off Labyrinth sheet music from the wonderful site Jareth's music hall, I have lyrics to all the songs that have them, the list could go on and on. This movie really made an impact on my life. The fact that I am obsessed with muppets helped out.Besides, some great voices are featured in the film, such as Kevin Clash, Brian Henson,  Danny John-Jules, and others. Jim Henson's muppets definately helped the film out. It had dramatic scenes, but the goblins provided lots of comic relief. Hoggle was a great character.

Sarah is plunging in puberty — that all of it might be going on in her dreams. That her companions on this journey are merely living versions of her most reassuring bedroom toys. When she departs the land, she is finally departing childhood.Of course i was not thinking this as a child, it was just a fantastic world full of puppets. It does seem to get a little aimless at times and many encounters come to nothing. Yet the puppetry is nothing short of genius from the mind of Jim Henson.Yes the effects are dated but so are some of the classics that revered by most.If you never watched this film as a child i think you missed out, watching it as an adult will never be the same but it still enjoyable. make sure you show this to your kids as I know I will.",Labyrinth

Labyrinth is just one of those movies that keeps coming up in lists for movies and movie characters and movie performances and you keep hearing about it and hearing about it until you say to yourself one day: ""that's it I'm so watching this movie to see what all the fuss is about"", and so I watched the movie and I loved every minute of it. Labyrinth is exactly my favorite kind of movie, a family friendly flick that speaks well to every grown up's inner child and take every viewer in an other worldly adventure. Sarah's journey was such a wonderful adventure to go through and she has evolved in every step of it, the baby was the adorable annoying mix that we all know to exist in babies. and the Villain, OMG, can a villain ever be that intimidating and that likable in the same time? David Bowie was just amazing here and I don't know much people who disagree. all the supporting characters, even the ones who didn't get much screen time were great, all the effects where amazing. and by the end of it I started feeling like a seven years old again.",Labyrinth

In this movie some of the characters were unbelievable because they had doors that talk, goblins and all sorts of strange creatures in it. The effects in this movie were as I said stunning because in some parts people were walking up-side-down and a lot of stuff like that.

188,wildebeest-2,still magical despite the flaws,9,22 June 2001,"Spoilers in this review.Like many people I saw this film as a teenager and was completely entranced by it - for two main reasons, firstly, because I felt like they had read my diaries in order to write the character of Sarah!!! And secondly because David Bowie is and was so sexy!Seeing it as an adult I can see the flaws. The script is very weak, as is the concept. Sorry but, as beautiful as Jennifer Connelly is (I always wanted to be her) her acting is really not great, but then again, with a script like that I don't really know if she could have shown us what she was really made of! I was never very scared of the Goblin king. For all his show of evil, how can a guy who rules over a bunch of such incompetents be scary? How could such an army possibly hold dominion over even a fairytale land? And since he has such power, why does he stand back and watch Sarah barge into the castle, telling his idiot goblins minions, 'Do something!' Sorry but it just doesn't hold any water.I would LOVE to remake this movie with a truly scary bunch of goblins and a truly evil king. To all those who were wondering, yes I believe he is in love with her. This would not have to be lost. And also, making the goblins truly evil would not have to lose the humour either. Plenty other movies have scores of frightening evil minions with the old stupid one providing comic relief. It's not that hard to do!!  :)The last scene between Jareth and Sarah was terrible. He looked amazing and her acting wasn't too bad, but those lines, aaaargh. It must have really pained Bowie (such an intelligent guy) to have to say 'I ask so little. Just fear me, love me, let me rule you, and you can have anything you want.' There is no attempt to veil his true intentions at all - only a complete idiot would be taken in by that little speech. PLEASE can we have some subtlety - after all the movie has been at pains to suggest that the goblin king is wily and manipulative. That was not manipulative. That was just a really bad attempt.The very ending, I am sorry to say (and I thought this even when I was a teenager) is absolutely pathetic. The intention is good, but carried out really badly. 'Every now and then in my life, for no reason at all, I need you - all of you' would make sense if she said it a few months into the future once she'd had time to realise the sense of it. But straight after she just got out of the labyrinth? It's totally illogical. She hasn't even had enough time to put her toys and costumes away.But when all is said and done I have to say I adore this movie even still. There are some classic lines - 'It's so entertaining being your hat.'  'I hit something? Yes? No?' that you really can't beat and always have me in stitches. And despite all the holes the visuals are such that I can still let myself be carried away by the fantasy.",Labyrinth

Even today being much older and seeing it I still love it. I really can't explain why. I see the corniness of it and still can't help but love it. I even own it and watch it a lot of the time. I guess I'll call it a guilty pleasure. I guess for some reason I just love the story, the characters, and the world that was created. At times I wish there was a sequel but in a way I know that it's better that it didn't have one.Considering the time this movie came out the directors and others who worked on the film really did do some amazing things. Remember this was back in the day when we didn't have all these re-makes and not everything seemed to be based off a book. In fact the way I heard it the book came after this movie came out. I have noticed that this movie does have a pretty big cult following though, so I can't feel too bad about loving it as I do. Although strangely I'm probably one of the only ones to love this movie and not love David Bowie. True I think he makes a great villain and still has dignity after dressing the way he did. But I never and still don't have googly eyes for him. Or that's how I put it. I never seen him in a romantic light. I'm the person who voted for Sarah to beat him and leave. Never did I wish she could stay with him or wish I could stay with him. I will admit though that I like the songs in this movie, always have. Probably the only Bowie songs I like besides Changes. I think it's a really great family movie and has things for all ages.Last note. For all of the love I have for this movie I will always remember that there was something that scared me in this movie. It's really stupid and I laugh at it now. But as a child the ball scene always scared me. There I said it. Really it was the masks that scared me. It never kept me from enjoying the movie though.

192,delnegro-IMDb,"Good, but not quite as good as the sum of its parts",8,11 January 2005,"Labyrinth is worth watching, no doubt about it, but it's one of those movies where the whole is smaller than the sum of the parts. The puppets and sets are magnificent, Jennifer Connelly is great, and the dialogues are full of humour, but the story makes very little sense (especially the beginning and the end). You could change the order of many scenes and not even notice it.Bowie, who is a decent actor is most of his movies, is absolutely terrible in this one. I'm not sure if it was his fault or the director's, but he just feels wooden, as if he's reading his lines from a cue card - reminded me of Patsy from Absolutely Fabulous, when she's nervous and freezes (""Yeah, cheers, thanks a lot.""). The songs are also pretty bad and feel out of place, except for the last one (in the Escher ""Relativity"" labyrinth). Fortunately, he's not on-screen for very long, and the puppets and Connelly are able to turn almost every scene into a small work of art.The DVD includes a mini documentary that shows how some of the scenes and creatures were made, but unfortunately leaves many other unexplained. In a movie as complex as Labyrinth, I think a longer and more thorough ""making of"" would be justified.",Labyrinth

""Labyrinth"" is a wonderful tale of a teenage girl named Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly, lost in the magical Labyrinth. The labyrinth is ruled by the Goblet King Jareth, played by David Bowie. Bowie's charm and presence enriches the movie greatly. The movie has some fun, pure 80's, songs by Bowie and also includes the very beautiful ""As the world falls down"".What i did not like about the movie is the fact that it gets kind of slow near the end.

Plus, David Bowie and his too, too, stylish, music.For adults: They get the blessed feeling of nostalgia when they watch the show again, possibly with their own kids.The thing that ties it all together is the ""coming of age"" theme. We first see Sarah acting out her fantasies as a little child would. Her perilous journey through the labyrinth is reminiscent of the turbulent teen years. And when she tells the Goblin King ""You have no power over me"", and rescues her little brother, she's crossed over into adulthood and is ready to be more responsible.But the cherry on top is the closing dialog when she sees her old friends from the Labyrinth in her bedroom mirror:Ludo: Goodbye, Sarah.Didymus: And remember, fair maiden, should you need us...Hoggle: Yes, should you need us, for any reason at all...Sarah: I need you, Hoggle.Hoggle: You do?Sarah: (nods) I don't know why, but every now and again in my life, for no reason at all!My takeaway: grown-ups can still indulge in fantasies once in awhile, and in so doing, feed their inner child.﻿",Labyrinth

I am speaking, of course, of none other than the one, the only, Mr. David Bowie.Bowie's physical beauty was glowing, his voice was as angelic as it always was, and his acting performance was enchanting as the Goblin King (Jareth). Splendid in his contoured leggings, ruffled shirt, glittering vest, and mane of golden strands (it was a wig, I know, but still. . .), The Gentleman (as I refer to Bowie on the Net, capital T capital G) cut a regally fine figure, and his voice (both singing and speech) was as sexy as ever. The Bowie songs made the film, in my opinion, and none of them would be out of place on any of the three recordings that the gorgeous and gifted Thin White Emperor (another way I designate Bowie) put out in the mid '80s. Also, Bowie is an unparalleled dancer, as showcased in the ballroom fantasy scene and the ""Magic Dance"" scene.This is a movie for kids, teens, grownups, romantics, dreamers, Bowie fans -- just about anyone.

199,SmashMonkey,be careful what you wish for,9,16 August 2006,"i first saw this film at the age of 12 and immediately fell in love both with it and David bowie. this is not your average fairy tale, its darkly comic and slightly Gothic charms are the perfect antidote to the saccharine sweetness of so many Disney movies. the story is wonderfully inventive, the songs memorable and, considering it was made in the 80's, some of the visual effects are quite stunning. bowie's performance as the goblin king has got to be his best ever, managing to combine power, world-weary cynicism, a wicked sense of humour and just a hint of sadness. it is impossible to dislike his character and, by the end of the film, i actually felt sorry for him. Jennifer Connelly's progression from a spoilt brat living in her own fantasy world to mature, sensible and responsible big sister is subtle enough to avoid being preachy, whilst still being a timely warning to all brats out there. of course, the human cast members are completely overshadowed by Jim Henson's fabulous puppet stars, most notably sir didymus and hoggle (although hoggle was actually an actress in a suit). the final showdown between bowie and Connelly, utilising the designs of m. Escher, was simply amazing. this may be a fantasy film, but it's not just for the kids. this one is a delight for the whole family.",Labyrinth
200,The_Vigilante,The best film ever made. Period.,10,26 July 2001,"Labyrinth can only be described as a major fantasy success that was loved by children and adults all round the globe. The opinion of some is that this film is wasted on children as it is a superbly crafted, well written and finely directed film which can only be appreciated by people of a certain age and film knowing experience. I believe that these people are wrong, and that all people regardless of their age and film know-how should experience Labyrinth's magic.The film was directed by one George Lucas, infamous for a little film he made called Star Wars. Labyrinth combines his talents with Jim Henson, widely known as the creator of the Muppets. Labyrinth in no way can be compared to a muppet film; it can only be compared with Jim's previous fantasy film The Dark Crystal'. Though Labyrinth isn't as dark as Dark Crystal it still bats in the same league. Labyrinth's magic begins to work on the viewer right from the start as the opening credits roll to the music of David Bowie. As the camera zooms in we see a girl who is re-enacting her favourite book Labyrinth'. This girl is the film's central character, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly: Dark City, The Rocketeer, Requiem for a Dream). When she arrives home late she has an arguement with her stepmother (Shelly Thompson: Morons from Outer Space, Just like a Woman) over having to babysit her baby brother Toby. When Sarah is left with Toby he begins to cry, a cry that brings Sarah to call for the Goblin King to take him away. This is where Henson's puppet mastery comes into play. There is a wonderful couple of seconds where Sarah, as she is saying the words for the Goblin King to take Toby away, is being listened to by a few a goblins inside her mirror. This is only one of the little cute' scenes in this film that shows that Henson and Lucas can combine ideas to produce such memorable scenes that you will undoubtedly cherish.When the Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie: The Man Who Fell to Earth) makes his appearance Sarah begs him to give Toby back to her. Eventually the king tells her that if she can solve his labyrinth and get to his castle that lies beyond on the Goblin City within 13hours, she can have Toby back, however if she doesn't Toby has to stay with him forever. Sarah has no choice and accepts his deal.The first of the Labyrinths characters Sarah comes across is Hoggle, a goblin who likes jewels. This has to be one of the film's most memorable scenes in which Sarah is asking him to help her get into the Labyrinth while Hoggle walks around killing fairies. This scene shows brilliant camera work from Colin Corby and excellent direction from Lucas, as Sarah and Hoggle walk around the entrance of the Labyrinth, which appears to be huge.Hoggle eventually shows Sarah how to get into the labyrinth. While she is pondering which way to go Trevor Jones's music manages to build up a confined atmosphere which really adds to the film at these early points.As Sarah walks deeper into the Labyrinth, Lucas switches scenes and brings us into the Goblin Kings castle in which he is singing surrounded by goblins, another spellbinding feat by Jim Henson where goblins appear to be jumping ten foot in the air and throwing Toby in the air aswell.As Sarah continues through the Labyrinth she encounters more weird and wonderfull characters such as Ludo, the huge beast with a huge heart; Didymus, the dog soldier; The junk lady and of course the blue worm.When Sarah and her gang' appear before the goblin city within the 13 hour period Jareth calls his goblin soldiers to get rid of them. This is one of the best pre-climax film scenes to come out of Hollywood, brilliant puppetry and almost magical scenery which again is brilliantly shot by Lucas, there is no doubt that there will be at least several bits which you will laugh at and chuckle about later.When they get to the castle Sarah informs the rest of them that she has to go on alone, a brilliant scene which will bring a tear to your eye. When Sarah climbs the stairs she is faced by lots of staircases which appear to lead no-where. When Jareth appears he points out where Toby is, and Sarah tries to get to him. This scene has been copied but never bettered. Copiers include the 1989 horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child', a very camp horror sequel of a sequel of a sequel of a sequel staring everyones favourite bogeyman.The film's climax is a one on one confrontation between Sarah and Jareth, which seems to be shot on some sort of astrial plain. This scene produces such memorable lines from both parties especially Jareth. The ending is isn't strong enough to spawn a sequel.A family/fantasy film, which appeals to children and parents, that has a plot is very hard to find today. So if you haven't already seen this film you must make it your priority to see it, regardless of your age, because everyone still has a young child within them.",Labyrinth
201,nieltje,great laugh!,10,6 November 2003,"when I read the summary of ""Labyrinth"" I was thinking of some kind of computer game (I mean with the goblins and stuff) I was watching it with a friend, who'd seen it before and I didn't really know what to expect from it. I thought it sucked bigtime, until I saw David Bowie as the Goblin King. I was surprised to see him like that, espessially because the film is older than I am, and I don't know David Bowie like that (as an actor I mean). but from that moment I just simply LOVED the film and its humor. I'm not saying that Jennifer Connely doesn't do a great job, but she can't handle the movie herself, but she plays Sara very, very well. just watch it and you'll see what I mean.",Labyrinth

Now somewhat older, I'm surprised at how much of it I remember 14 years later.  The plot freaked me out a bit (remember I was a child!), and David Bowie gave my little brain hours of contemplation.  He was the coolest thing in this entire movie.  Now I realize he looked about as 80s as you can get, but at the time I thought his getup was exactly how everyone should dress.",Labyrinth

I watched it as a child, and it still holds the same magic and wonder it did for me then, seeing it for the first time. I've shared it with my son, and I hope one day to have a daughter to share it with as well.David Bowie is at the top of his game as the Goblin King. Talented, romantic...You just want to be in Sarah's shoes in this movie! He is so commanding and gorgeous in this fantasy role.The songs are catchy and will stay in your head long after the film is over. You don't want her to leave, yet you want it all to work out for her in the end (I personally would have stayed with David Bowie!) Not since this movie came out has any other film been quite the same. Nothing can or will ever match it, though there are two other films that have their own magic and remembrance: Legend and The last unicorn. All in all, Labrinth is a great family film that will stay fresh and timeless- and will never be equalled.",Labyrinth

The characters were so memorable and the plot was a little off the beaten path. However, the one thing that everyone remembers was the music. The songs that David Bowie sings are unforgettable. The only thing that made me mad was that they did not release a ""Labyrinth"" soundtrack and none of the songs have ever been released on any David Bowie CDs. This is one of the 10 greatest musicals ever made. Everyone should see this. Another reason that everyone remembers this movie is that it was one of the first movies that Jennifer Connelly made.

I've watched it a few times since trying to give it another chance but it's just dumb, the acting is horrible, I honestly can't think of a redeeming quality but I do love Jennifer Connelly and Jim Henson is certainly creative with the characters. It's too dark for smaller children who wouldn't notice how juvenile the writing is and it's too corny for older kids.",Labyrinth
207,augurar,"Pretty good, not great",6,3 April 2012,"I think this was a fine movie, and it was interesting to see the puppetry, 80s soundtrack, and so on, but the core story was pretty average. For someone very familiar with the hero's journey (I used to read a lot of fantasy novels as a kid), this movie had little new to offer. I don't have a problem with this tried-and-true story structure, but the movie just didn't do a particularly good job of executing it.While the basic motivation for the plot (a wish gone awry, more or less) has good potential for a story, the goblin king seems a little too wooden for the setup to really be convincing. Does he actually want to keep the child, or is his real intention to give the heroine a test of character? It seems like the answer is neither. He repeatedly professes dismay at Sarah's progress, yet does little to stop her and seems to be strangely uninterested in what's happening. Bowie certainly looked the part but I think his uninflected portrayal failed to be compelling overall.Another thing I thought was problematic was the lack of real threat in the story. Throughout the movie, the heroine encounters trials such as: getting lost, falling in a hole, and having to cross a bad-smelling swamp. I understand the movie was geared towards children, but I think the level of menace and dramatic tension could have been increased without making the movie too family-unfriendly. After all, kids already know fear. There are certainly things I fear as an adult, but nothing can equal my childhood terror at the thought of raccoons (don't laugh), terrible creatures of the darkness that invaded our yard to shatter our illusions of suburban security and raid our trash cans. But I digress. My point is, the challenges faced by the heroine seem pretty tame even by kids' movie standards.The final abyss was especially weak. Rather than a climactic scene in which the heroine has to confront her own inner demons, she instead has to overcome... Escherian staircases? Then she struggles to remember a monologue (as the main antagonist waits patiently) and finally triumphs when she utters the last line: ""You have no power over me"". Well, that's all well and good, but it really could have been a lot better. (Even ""Bartholomew and the Oobleck"" had a more exciting climax, and in that story the main antagonist was inclement weather!)Still, the movie had some good messages about responsibility and growing up, the power of friendship and kindness, and so on. And it was pretty imaginative. It's something I wouldn't mind my kids watching, if I ever have kids. All in all, it was pretty good -- just not great.",Labyrinth
208,horseygurlz,"A bit odd, but very entertaining",7,9 August 2012,"Despite the fact that this film is quite old, it's age doesn't detract from the overall viewing experience.David Bowie's performance as the Goblin King is extremely entertaining, and the songs are very catchy and stay in your head. The character is intriguing and very different to the normal 'bad guy' - you never really know whether he is truly good or bad.Sarah at first seems like a complete spoilt brat, and Jennifer Connelly depicts this very well, but as she changes this is captured equally skillfully. Her character is straightforward and not terribly appealing, but I suppose some people would learn to love her as the film went on.The main criticism for this film is that it is just plain strange - in both a good and bad way. The oddness makes it unique and appealing and is very well done, but it is also quite confusing.A fun film to watch!",Labyrinth

One of them speaks, so they BOTH should be able to speak BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH DOGS."" Then there's the little man-thing in a hat who you think is Danny De Vito or Dudley Moore or somebody, but then it hits you it's not a man at all, but a puppet. But then you realise it's not entirely a puppet, but a sort of puppet/man hybrid with the body of a man and the head of a puppet which makes you wonder whether it IS Dudley Moore after all. So you fast forward the tape to see if it is Dudley Moore, but then you can't find his name on the credits and by the time you've rewound, all you can think is, ""Hang on, this isn't Arthur  what the hell's going on?"" Suddenly David Bowie appears looking like Tina Turner from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and you keep wondering why a kid's film has turned into an advert for Bowie's giant penis; but before you can answer this Billy Crystal's turned up (I think), and Bowie's walking on the ceiling talking to a baby who's attached to the bloody wall.I will never watch this monstrous, kaleidoscopic horror show of a movie ever again.",Labyrinth

Jennifer Connelly graces the screen in one of her earliest roles. Jim Henson's creature creations flesh out a fantastic but strangely believable world. The characters Sarah meets on her adventures have captured the imaginations of millions of viewers. Fans still make tributes and recreations even over 20 years after its release and Labyrinth merchandise still sales in huge numbers. While it faired poorly financially when released, Labyrinth has shown that it was simply just ahead of its time. Its magic is still strong for people all over the world.

It's corny, it's hoaky, it's dated... yes. Although, imagine watching this through a child's eye without being spoiled with all the graphics and sounds.

When I was little I used to think, ""Oh no, the evil Goblin King!"" But now I think, ""Whoa, that's David Bowie."" I see the movie in different eyes now. Watching David Bowie as the Goblin King is so cool! He is perfect for the role. The music is obviously awesome, since most of it is sung by David Bowie. I love the scene where Sarah and Jareth dance to ""As The World Falls Down."" It's so memorable! The effects were really good for its time period. The part with the stairs is probably my favorite part of the movie. It's so cool to watch people walking upside down and around.The only thing that really bothers me is Sarah being a bit of a brat at the beginning.

The story's opening should appeal to many kids: teenaged Sara rebels at the baby-sitting duties that interfere with her vivid fantasy life. She would never hurt the child, but creates a fairy tale around her frustration. In this story, the beautiful princess (Sara, of course) is set free when denizens of Fairy-land abduct the evil infant. Then, suddenly, the fairy tale becomes real.The story is Sara's quest to recover the lost child from Jared, played by David Bowie. He works well as the world's dark lord, even if his song scenes seemed gratuitous. Sara traverses the mythic Labyrinth guided, misguided, and befriended by beings from Jim Henson's wonderful imagination. This is the true magic of ""Labyrinth,"" the sustained vision, comical and fantastical, of Brian Froud's world peopled by Henson's creatures. The whole world is simply amazing - and it goes on, in changing scenes and amazing detail, for the rest of the movie.This is a wonderful kids' movie, with no real violence or adult themes, and with a happy ending.

Escher), the puppets (from Jim Henson) the romance between Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) and the Goblin King (David Bowie), was just magical. A modern day version of this film would just have used CGI but its nostalgic and wonderful to see real puppets in action in a kids film. I am sure any child of the time imagined themselves running around in that maze avoiding the challenges set and having such companions as Hoggle, Ludo and Ambrocious (that last name makes me think of Ambrosia Rice Pudding for some reason). David Bowie as the Goblin King though, I'm sure he had all the girls falling at his feet he had power, mystery and I guess for the ladies looks.

221,Mr. Man-3,Part of Jim Henson company's imaginative archive...,7,24 July 2006,"Jim Henson is a fascinating man. His Muppets and other puppets are truly extraordinary, beautiful, and creative. They have more life in them than just about any other form of animation out there. The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth are truly cool movies - they existed because these guys wanted to do something really unique, and that deserves wild applause.Labyrinth itself has a fantastic idea behind it - young Sarah, who is struggling with growing up and the responsibility that comes with it, is left to watch her baby brother while her parents go out. In a moment of selfishness, she wishes goblins would take her brother away...and they do. Now Sarah has only 13 hours to work her way through a massive Labyrinth, or her brother is gone forever! The premise is great fantasy - it takes a very human character, with a very human problem, and blows it delightfully out of proportion. There is plenty of adventure and wacky friends, and of course, David Bowie is our villain! The budget of the film shows - many sequences are amazing and epic, and some of the puppets are massive and intricately detailed! That said, I think the movie lacks characterisation, particularly for Sarah. She has such grandeur in her line delivery that it is hard to believe she is anything but a fictional character. That undermines what I found so appealing about the story - that the events in the story are caused by her actions and attitude. This lack of deep, real characterisation hurts some of the other characters in the film, particularly Hoggle.Of course, if you grew up with the film, or you are a big fan of the other Henson films (The Dark Crystal, Mirrormask), you'll have a tough time hating it.

If I say it enough times everyone who reads this will too :PThere are some in this world who hate this movie.  I know of one person myself, who feels the only good thing about it is David Bowie with a mullet.Then there are those, like me, and most people I know, who see it as a high point in cinema.  Now I'm not a 'Star Wars' fan, in fact I only watch the original for Peter Cushing, and I only want to see the latest for Christopher Lee.  But George Lucas DID make 'Howard The Duck', which can only be a good thing.  Jim Henson is a god - that was already universally known before I started this.  Terry Jones is a god also - hey, he's a Python!  David Bowie is also one of my favourite musicians, who, despite comments to the contrary, has proved he can act in films such as 'The Man Who Fell To Earth', 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence', 'The Linguini Incident' and of course 'Labyrinth'.Jennifer Connolly puts in an early performance of merit sixteen years before her Oscar win, and Bowie is fantastic and, as many members of the opposite sex have told me, very sexy as Jareth.  Then there are the others.  They a re not muppets, they are not animatronic creatures - as far as I'm concerned they are alive.  They may as well be as they are so lifelike it's unbelievable.  Hoggle, Ludo, The Worm, The Fieries, and especially Sir Didymus (hee hee :) hee hee) are all wonderful creatures you'd love to meet, and I'm not just speaking for myself when I say how great it would be to have a house full of goblins ala Jareth's Castle.The imagery is wonderful, the script first rate, the acting from the leads and the puppeteers superb.  The music is the best Bowie made between 'Scary Monsters' in 1981 and '1. Outside' in 1995.  There is nothing wrong with this film whatsoever.  When I watched 'The Godfather' I thought ""Yeah - a good movie, a great movie"" but I wasn't enthralled by it - it didn't make me feel uplifted.  ""Labyrinth"" does.

I was around 10 years old and it never tired me to watch it over and over and over.At the time I didn't understand many things in the movie, the lessons of life. It were the characters, played by real people and by puppets alike, which won my heart and made me want to return to that world time and again.I was so sad when my brother accidentally recorded something else over my Labyrint video. It never aired again and I slowly forgot about it only to remember it every now and again when seeing or hearing the names of David Bowie or Jennifer Connely, or the word labyrinth.And now, almost two decades later, I found it again! This time, when watching it with adult eyes, I judged the movie differently. I saw details, little touches which I hadn't notice before as a child. Also, I noticed the life lessons (don't take everything for granted, don't say things in anger for example) and guess what, even though the movie has been made in a time when technology wasn't as advanced as what we have today, it was still very good! It's the story itself, the acting of the characters, the dialogues which make this movie so special. I've seen many movies made with super modern technology, yet they didn't impress me as much as Labyrint still does, because they have no real story. It's the special effects that carry those movies, you take their special effects away, there is nothing left. A real good movie, to me, is carried by the excellent dialogues, acting, good story lines.Labyrint is still a great movie. I've shown it to my children and they loved it. It was great to share something that is special to me with my children and watch them enjoy it as much as I did as a kid.Even watching it as an adult is a pleasure. I was first afraid, that perhaps in my memory I might have lifted this movie up too high, after all, as a child you value different things than as an adult and your memory often makes you remember what you want to remember and how you want to remember something.

233,arikiczkowski,Sadly overrated,5,25 October 2021,"Prior to this month,I had last seen this movie in the late 80s, and been kind of disappointed. Seeing so many people have such fond memories of it made me want to rewatch and reconsider. Unfortunately, my opinion is pretty much the same as it was 30-odd years ago.It's kind of cool to see David Bowie as the Goblin King, and he performs a couple of songs, but they really don't seem to fit into the plot of the story so much as the plot of the story seems contrived to make the songs seem more relevant to the onscreen action.Jim Henson's creations are, as always, amusing and interesting, but seem almost more Sesame Street than Muppet Show, as though intended to appeal to an audience younger than the late-preteen/early teenage audience for which the plot and story were obviously intended.I would recommend skipping it, especially if you are a fan of Jim Henson and David Bowie. And the script by Monty Python's Terry Jones has some amusing moments. It's worth a watch, just don't go into it expecting to be blown away. It might happen, which will be, for you, a pleasant surprise, but I suspect most grownup, of which I am sadly a part, will find it somewhat tedious and overlong.Frankly, I went in expecting something to the Dark Crystal, which was a far superior effort by Henson, that I have seen numerous time, and which holds up better over the past four decades. I would recommend that one without reservation. Both try for epic quest fantasy tales, but only one really succeeds, the far superior Dark Crystal. Labyrinth, sadly feels SMALL, rather than epic.Or go watch the original Muppet Movie. I must have seen that 15 times when it was in theaters and more on home video. Lots of laughs, a great supporting cast, with many great cameos, and a soundtrack that is still singable today.

Its my 2nd Favorite movie of ALL TIME..",Labyrinth
235,CuriousGrl,A film not only for children but for adults. Very Honest.,10,30 January 2007,"I have seen this film as a child and just recently watched it again. I saw a lot of truth in it. People lead you into this confusion of the emotional labyrinth and you run and jump through hoops until you can tell them ""you have no power over me"". How often we do this with people and with ourselves.Actions, thoughts, words, emotions etc create confusion, fear, anxiety within us that takes a position of power over us. It is only when we realize that we can claim power over these things at any time that we are truly free. Until then we journey over the same steps over and over again confused and lost. It is also a film about the meaning of friendship. That those true to us will always be there. Before her main furry friends disappear from her room they say to her ""but if you need us, if you really need us""and she rejoices with them and her new found freedom.",Labyrinth
236,THFC,I wish someone had handed me over to the Goblin King when I was a kid!,10,7 December 1998,"Cool film! Way too good for children. Jim Henson, as ever, is the absolute master of every kind of puppetry known to man or muppet.Particularly adorable is the little punk worm who invites Sarah to ""Come inside and meet the missus""... very cute. The plot has all the essential elements of a good fairy tale with the added bonus of a heroine who manages to get through all her trials and tribulations without squealing feebly or fainting into the arms of any poxy bloke. David Bowie is wonderfully sexy (despite the fright wig) and his natural humour shines through although his character does a pretty good job of being spiteful and menacing. I get the feeling the he really enjoyed making this film. The soundtrack is excellent and ""As the World Falls Down"" is quite hauntingly beautiful ('though I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that the ballroom sequence in which it was played did slow the action down a little - but it was a visual feast).All in all, a beautiful film with a wonderful cast of creatures and humans. Makes me miss Jim Henson's talents lots but at least we've still got Brian (his son).

This is the kind of movie a child only dreams about... it's got fairies, goblins, magical creatures and the most charming Goblin King played by David Bowie himself... for being 1986, special effects were pretty good, and I found Jim Henson's work with muppets truly amazing. I would not believe when my parents told me that only Sarah, Jareth and little Toby were real. Growing up, I never stopped loving ""Labyrinth"".

I am a huge David Bowie fan and he is fantastic (even though he is the bad guy). The music is phenomenal, one of my favorite songs of all time is 'When the world falls down', the song when Sarah is having the vision after taking a bite of the tainted peach.

240,martinrking,Labyrinth sags too much in the middle,5,6 September 2017,"Labyrinth features incredible set design and puppetry. The world is consistently magical and darkly beautiful. Unfortunately, the film sags deeply in the middle. With only a couple of exceptions, the dozens of creatures all share the same squeaky and shrill voice that gets increasingly grating as the movie goes on. The script also steadily declines until the final sequence. Even during the worst parts of Labyrinth, there's still a lot of fantastic things to look at, but I just felt like putting the movie on mute. There's an incongruity in Labyrinth between the themes and the presentation: the themes are clearly intended to resonate with young teens, but the movie frequently plays out like a cartoon for young children (there is one overly-long sequence dedicated to toilet humour, and a lot of weightless slapstick violence, as a couple of examples). As a children's film, I wouldn't recommend it because of the sexual content, and as a teen movie, I wouldn't recommend it because of its childishness. Labyrinth stands as an achievement in design and practical effects technique, but as a story it is severely lacking in plot, characters, dialogue, pacing, and cohesiveness.",Labyrinth

This movie is beautiful, with excellent detail work throughout. One could not ask for a better Sara then Jennifer Connelly, who kept Sara from coming of as spoiled, instead of merely unhappy and frustrated. The story is right out of a fairy tale.This is not a bad movie, by any account, but there are distinct flaws that keep it from reaching the heights of The Dark Crystal or The Princess Bride. For all the work on the special effects, there are points where there are dark lines around all the foreground characters and the bluescreening is clear. Far too much of Sara's travels were dependent on luck, rather then intelligence or wisdom. And both the Fieries and the  battle in the Goblin City were long, ""wacky"" action scenes that lost me due to their being random and not being about Sara.",Labyrinth

With a fantastic story, beautiful visuals, stunning acting and unforgettable music, Labyrinth has received a spot on my all time favorite movies list. Labyrinth, a horribly underrated film, has held a special place in my heart since I was a child, and I have never met a person that has seen Labyrinth that hasn't thought it to be absolutely flawless. Sarah, the epitome of teen angst, is being prowled upon by David Bowie in super tight pants after banishing her baby brother to a land of goblins. I can think of very few things that are more interesting than that. Bowie delivers a fabulous performance, creating a gloriously sensual antagonistic character(though, somewhat pedophile), and Jennifer Connelly, one of the prettiest ladies in Hollywood, reminds us all of how bratty we were during our teenage years. In short, Jim Henson, George Lucas, David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly. There you go.",Labyrinth
243,thehappyspaceman,Critics in the 1980s were crazy.,8,18 September 2016,"Yeah, apparently at the time a lot of people hated Labyrinth. Both Siskel and Ebert panned the movie, other critics bashed David Bowie's performance, and it bombed at the box office, but somehow it's still remembered to this day in a positive light, and that's mainly because Labyrinth isn't bad. Labyrinth is awesome. I own a VHS of this movie and I used to watch it endlessly when I was a kid. It was my first real exposure to David Bowie. I had probably heard some of his songs before then, but it wasn't until this movie when I connected the voice with the person, and when I first saw him, I said to myself, ""I wanna be like that guy when I grow up."" Anyway, enough nostalgia. Back to critiquing this movie. The effects and Muppetry are amazing for the most part, the characters are likable, the songs are catchy, and David Bowie brings a lot of presence to his performance. I think that the only criticisms I can think of are that the story doesn't always stay focused and that the ""Chilly Down"" scene doesn't age well at all. Also, Jennifer Connelly's acting needed some work, but to be fair, it was her first movie and we couldn't expect her to be Oscar-winning quality just yet.

244,mia-manns,Gotta love Labyrinth,10,22 March 2011,"""Within your eyes, I'll place the sky"" David Bowie meets Jim Hensen. Incredible. This movie is so weird and so magical, no one should go without seeing it. However, if you made it into your adult life without ever entering the labyrinth, it may just be too late for you. Labyrinth is just too strange watch unless you saw it before you were ten.Bowie plays the Goblin King, although he does appear distinctly human, particularly when surrounded by muppet-like goblins and they all sing and dance together. The puppets are exactly what make this movie fantastic, but too estranging for the adult sensibilities. Some chase little girls, some can take off their own heads and juggle them, some function as door- knockers and some are British worms that say ""'Allo,"" and not hello.If you know what I'm talking about, you know how awesome this is. If you don't, then you have probably lost any respect you had for me as a movie reviewer. That's fine - I know I'm appealing to nostalgia here.After watching this as an adult, I can see why this appealed so much to me as a 6 year old, and later as a teen. Sarah is a strong female hero, determined and unwavering. Jareth, the goblin king, can give Sarah anything she wants, and can sense her every desire (as creepy as that sounds). He takes her baby brother away to fulfill a dark desire among older siblings - to be an only child again, the centre of attention. She immediately recognizes the fault in her desire, and asks for Toby back, but Jareth has hidden him in the centre of his labyrinth in the hopes that along the way he can tempt her into leaving her real life behind.Sarah is a girl who lives in a fantasy world, and her appeal to Jareth is a reflection of this, but in the end, her duty to her family and her life is stronger than the pull of the magical world. She fights long and hard, struggling through a maze of tricks and traps to get Toby back, and in the end she faces Jareth and everything he can offer her. She rejects the fantasy of being his queen.""Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one.""",Labyrinth

I liked the humor but sometimes the appearance of the puppets were too distracting and that is what I think dragged the ratings down. Jennifer Connelly held her own as such a young actress at the time and David Bowie was spectacular as the brooding, sinister Jareth the Goblin King.The plot and storyline are what keeps viewers like me in tune for years to come. The thought of a selfish teenager wishing something in a fit of anger without first thinking carefully about it repeats itself over and over again and is a wise message to tell to all children and adolescents. For this alone, Labyrinth is worth watching.

Despite the heroine's terrible acting, Henson's expressive puppetry, colorful characters, and firm grasp of the fairytale tradition of storytelling make this film accessible to children while still having enough thematic meat for adults. David Bowie's classic role as the mysterious and sensual Goblin King gives this film an edge that the saccharine children's movies of the 1990s have been sadly lacking as well.

Labyrinth is a breath of fresh air from all that.Despite Jim Henson being dead and gone, his movies live on- and Labyrinth rules supreme. Well, to me, anyways. With a combination of (gasp) original ideas, characters, and enchanting music, Labyrinth is a classic that is overshadowed by travesties such as LOTR.For those of us who were around in the 80's, like myself, chances are, you were familiar with David Bowie, rock god. He pulls himself up from that disaster The Hunger and plays Jareth the goblin king with wit, charm, and charisma that you can't deny.Jennifer Connelly- whom, I already loved from Phenomena/Seven minutes in Heaven- was perfect for Sarah- she had the right tone, right intelligence, right facial expressions- every scene where she wasn't in it left me begging Henson to bring her back (which he did! :) Labyrinth has everything that movies today only WISH that they could possess: great acting, great cast all around, fun/original storyline (Quick!

Labyrinth seemed as a great choice.Both David Bowie as Jareth and Jeniffer Connelly as Sarah act marvelously. The puppets are controlled by 52 puppeteers matching Bowie and Connelly's performance. 48 of them were used in the impressive Magic Dance scene. The creation of them was all done by Jim Henson (the father of the Muppet Show). He drew every one of them by himself. In a review, he mentions his notebooks in which he drew the puppets.Sarah, a 16 year old teenager, is a selfish girl who is very imaginative. While she is reading in a green garden she forgets all about time and arrives home late. Back home, she gets really angry at her dad and stepmother for forcing her to babysit her toddler brother Toby. After the parents leave their house, Toby starts crying non- stop. Sarah becomes even more furious and wishes him to be taken by the goblin king (Bowie). Her wishes come true and so an adventure begins...Even though it seems like there are a lot of special effects in the film, actually there are none except the owl in the beginning. It is one of the first ever CGI creations. And a legend like David Bowie added to this fantastic production makes it even better.

257,lewisgilber,"Wild, Wacky and incredible fun!",8,5 September 2019,"Many people have had left a powerful impact on many lives long after they've gone. But non more so than the likes of David Bowie. And after seeing 1986's Labyrinth, it's clear to see why.While outlandish and incoherent at times, this film is a stroke of pure cinematic magic.
The blending of talents from the likes of Jim Henson, George Lucas and Monty Python's Terry Jones results in a unique blend of wonder as the trio take us into what some of the more cynical among us might just write off as The Wizard Of Oz meets The Muppets. And while that is the bare basics of the narrative, the deep undertones of puberty and the emotional changes that come with it, add a more complex layer to the narrative, as well as the conflict between our two leads.Admittedly, Jennifer Connelly's performance does start out very poor, with the emphasis of making her character a whiny pain, making her easily comparable to the likes to Haydn Christiansen in Revenge Of The Sith. (Lucas, 2005) Thankfully, once Connelly enters the Labyrinth, her performance drastically improves, especially in moments where she interacts with the main draw for this film, the incredible David Bowie, who owns every second he's on screen. Whether he's interacting with Connelly, an infant baby or a gang of puppet characters, Bowie nails each and every moment, creating one of the most entertaining, albeit hard to understand antagonists in the last 40 years.The intentions of Bowie's character have been questioned and debated by many, but ultimately, I find that if you let the film speak to you however it wants to, you'll be able to process the answer that works best for you. And besides, as well as Bowie, the main draw is the terrific production design. And with Jim Henson's team behind all the puppets and large costumes truly makes these inanimate characters feel alive and real. For all the technological advantages of CGI, practical options can still be some of the best looking results a film maker can get. And besides a few dodgy green screen shots, and a more than obvious doll standing in for the baby in parts of the film, the effects have held up extremely well.Labyrinth deserves so much more praise than it gets. Sure it can be hard to process the narrative and some of it's effects work hasn't aged as well as it could've, but the effortless charm and endless entertainment value makes this a truly classic 80s film. Bowie's mesmerising performance will keep you entranced as you dive into the wild, wacky and highly fun world of the Labyrinth!SCORES

259,jiw2,Surprisingly mediocre,2,24 March 2012,"To begin with, I wasn't ten years old the first time I saw this film, so it isn't part of my treasured childhood memories. Maybe that's why I found it such a disappointment.Labyrinth is little more than a David Bowie rock concert, accompanied by the Muppets. I'd say the completely irrelevant Bowie rock songs dragged down the plot, if it weren't already so weak in the first place. Goblin King kidnaps girl's infant stepbrother; she goes into a magical world after the baby, and...you don't need spoilers to know how it's all going to turn out.Yes, I know -- the Quest is really an allegory for the girl's emotional transition out of childhood. I get it, honest I do. It's still clichéd, heavy-handed and predictable. This theme has been done before, and far better.Cross Fraggle Rock with mid-80s MTV, and you've got Labyrinth. After such a promising beginning with the far superior Dark Crystal, it's too bad the Henson organization had to stumble so badly on its second venture into classical fantasy.Fortunately, Jim Henson left behind far greater work than Labyrinth for us to remember him by.",Labyrinth

The Music perhaps? Is it the well respected Director? The underlined plot and general feeling? For me it is very much the general feeling of a film and the music that goes along with it. In my opinion, a bad score or soundtrack can give a film an ordinary almost cheesy feel and often can throw you off. Labyrinth attracted me right off just because of me being such a fantasy lover but..I must admit...it was David Bowie too. I had honestly never heard David Bowies music but after this movie I can say I'm definitely bewitched by his evident stare and strangely attractive melodies. This film is a true delight.

263,yaykisspurr,#1 Movie to Watch with your Girl Teenager,10,23 May 2012,"15-year-old Sarah is struggling with the existence of her baby half- brother, Toby. She accidentally wishes him away to the Goblin King Jareth who will keep Toby as his newest goblin if Sarah does not complete his Labyrinth in 13 hours.I first saw the film in my early teens when my parents bought the movie on laser disc. Today I'm not much of a fan of the muppets or musicals. I get restless and impatient, shifting and rolling my eyes. Yet even now I can take in the joy and boundless energy the muppets and music provided to Labyrinth. An integral part of the story and setting you can't separate one from the other and it be the same movie. So not only is this my favorite film from my teens, it's also my #1 muppet movie and #1 musical.I loved the choices she had to make in the first half of the movie. She tried the lipstick to mark her way – it didn't work but it was really smart. Every obstacle she tried thinking about it and using whatever she came up with as best she could. The logic puzzles seamlessly worked with the idea of a labyrinth and having to maneuver through a foreign place.David Bowie enchanted as a stony-faced villain king set on seducing a young girl in any way he could manage. The choice of making the glass- ball juggling act part of the character's mystery and allure worked, characterizing in such a visual way. I think he represented all the darker, more worldly choices a girl can make but in a way that is non- threatening to parents yet still calls to a teenager.Anyone with a sibling, especially a younger sibling, can totally relate to Sarah Williams. As a child you are still trying to figure out the right and wrongs of situations. Many times it is not until you've already done something that you realize it was wrong to do. Sarah made a situation like this feel sincere and believable. David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly played off one another very well, the age difference wasn't an issue and it could have been rather creepy.Two of my favorite characters are Hoggle, a dwarf with a penchant for cheap jewelry and Ludo, a gentle giant whom Sarah rescues from being tortured by goblins. They are such polar opposites that they made the perfect traveling companions. When Hoggle first betrayed Sarah I was more heartbroken and hurt than mad and angry. And the fact Ludo could call rocks to him just seemed to fit who the creature was. For a bag of fur and a plastic mask on a stick they made these two feel real and significant.Production wise I think they balanced between the plot which I love, the music which added mystery and allure and the muppets which added character and energy. If not done just so the whole thing could have been a cheesy mess. I think this says a lot about who was behind the film. Henson knew how to utilize his puppets in a way that made them relevant in the story. Lucas understood storytelling and that each element mattered. David Bowie's songs in particular fit the subject and tone of the film to perfection. The writers really helped the balance because the plot worked and made a great background on which to hang the music and muppets. It's this kind of balance that writers everywhere are attempting to achieve in their own writing. To make what potentially are the weaknesses (the music and muppets) into strengths really show how expertly this movie was produced.The two best scenes in the film have all to do with the writing though. The first when Jareth takes Sarah to the ball and she's an honest to goodness princess. And the second, a scene following when Sarah's back in her room around all her belongings that make her feel safe. Such a one – two punch. The first tried to suck her in with her hopes and dreams, the hopes and dreams any young teenager has about the future. Perhaps unrealistic ideals though. Then Jareth follows up with total reality and the safety the present provides. It's everything you know and want to hold on to so you don't have to face the future. Both, equally could suck her in and Jareth would win. It's this kind of struggle we want to see for our characters whether as a writer or as the audience.As a teenager you are in a struggle between your hopes and desires and the reality of real life. Coming to terms with where you fall as an individual is when you really grown up. Even at my age this movie hits a core place inside me when I watch it again because it shows and reminds you of the decisions you've made to get where you are today.Read more of my reviews at http://yaykisspurr.wordpress.com/",Labyrinth

And, for once we have a heroine who can fend for herself (usually) without relying on some hero to come out of the woodwork and save her. I wish they made more films like this.",Labyrinth
265,christine_daae,a true cult classic - and great fun,10,26 December 1999,"Labyrinth is an amazing fantasy, far too good to be merely labelled as a ""children's film.""  The detail is superb, especially in the cases of the Henson characters like Hoggle, Sir Didymus and the Junk Lady.  Jennifer Connelly is great as a heroine who can do things herself, without relying on some muscle-bound hero to pop out and save her.  And David Bowie - who could resist those tights?  He makes a wonderfully wicked - and sexy - villain, and his ethereal vocals really give a sense of magic to the film. So, what are the lessons we must all learn from Labyrinth?  Nothing is as it seems, don't take things for granted, and never, ever tell Jareth that his Labyrinth is a piece of cake.",Labyrinth
266,jjponta,A woman must find her baby brother kidnapped by Goblins,9,25 July 2001,"A visually stunning and emotionally endearing film depicting a young woman, who idly wishes that her baby brother could be whisked away by the Goblin King (David Bowie), only to have her wish come true. To secure her brother's return, she must pass a series of tests that lie within an incredible maze, with deadly consequences for anyone choosing incorrectly.  The story is solidly written by Jim Henson.  Performances by Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie are truly spell binding.  The cast of characters Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) meets up with are as memorable and captivating as any real actors. This gem of a film will entertain the young, and the young at heart.",Labyrinth
267,StormBorn,How can you top this?!,10,27 April 2001,"Jim Henson, the master of puppetry.  Brian Froud, the rightfully-acclaimed illustrator.  Bowie's wonderful songs.  Production, costume and makeup design that truly works *with* the themes of the movie.  What a team!This is often cited as a children's film, but I disagree.  To me, this is a fantasy movie for all ages.  It takes two archetypic myths (the Heroic Quest and the Coming of Age Story) and handles them with depth, sensitivity and humor.  Bowie especially is good--threatening and seductive while gradually revealing his deeper emotions.I first saw this when I was 26 and I *still* love Bowie's costume and hair! That tattered 18th century look is wonderful--and the tight pants are quite a treat. <grin>",Labyrinth

271,alanjudge-30219,One of my favorite childhood films,9,21 November 2017,"This film was one of my favorite as a kid. Both my brother and sister liked it equally. It applies to both sexes. Watching it again more recently also proves to me at least, it is a film adults can enjoy too.All the jokes that went over my head as a child I noticed to my amusement. The set and the puppets are wonderful and weird. Highlights include the 'Helping Hands' and the 'Bog of the Eternal Stench'.The character development is great and you warm to the kind-hearted band of friends that embark on an important mission. First to save Sarah's (Jen Connolly) baby brother and beat Jareth, The Goblin King's perplexing Labyrinth.The set design and the many puppets used are a visual treat. You do not see a film set you see the world of the Labyrinth. A world of weird and wonderful where left is right and right is left. Very much akin to Lewis Carroll's famous novel Alice in Wonderland. The surreal nature of the film gives it great depth and atmosphere.Davie Bowie is great as the Goblin King. He embodies the narcissistic despot living in the centre of the maze. Camping it up with style and providing the film with top class vocal performances in the film's musical interludes.I could write an essay on this film, but I think I have said enough. A great kid's film that parents will also love.",Labyrinth
272,Mephisto-7,A magical memorable journey through a world of artistic sight and sound,10,13 March 1999,"As a video store clerk, I see many movies that never quite manage to get the recognition they deserve, and Labyrinth is one of those films.  Another vision of artistic and technical achievement from Jim Henson, Labyrinth is a movie that remains with you for life.  To see it is to love it. While at first glance it may be branded a children's film, Labyrinth maintains complex story and artistic elements that children might miss.  While the story revolves around Sarah, played with innocence and strength by Jennifer Connelly, the true star is Jareth, the slightly sinister villain. As Jareth, David Bowie creates a villain who is at once charismatic and suave, but underneath like a child desperate for the attention of others.  He terrorizes her with trolls and chases her with Chillys, only to plead for her forfeiture to his will.  The film overflows its coffers with colorful characters to populate its world of wrong turns and wonderment (Many of these characters, and the same charming visuals return in two unreleased videos for Bowie's songs from the film, ""Underground"" and ""As The World Falls Down"").  It also contains memorable and touching music from Bowie himself as well as composer Trevor Jones. Once you hear the somber ""As The World Falls Down"" or the jubilant ""Magic Dance,"" it will be very difficult to forget them. Overall, Labyrinth is a touching fable filled with colorful characters and memorable music, and not to be underrated or left on the video shelf.  For fans of the style, I recommend Frank Oz's ""Dark Crystal"" and Ridley Scott's ""Legend"" with Tom Cruise.  For fans of Bowie, I recommend ""The Linguini Incident"" and ""The Hunger"", directed by Ridley Scott's brother Tony Scott.",Labyrinth
273,Soma-6,The most unforgettable fantasy movie,10,23 April 1999,"I first saw Labyrinth when I was 11 or 12. I remember being fascinated by it, and strangely enough, David Bowie was part of that strange attraction I had towards the movie. Technically, perhaps, it wasn't that well-done; they were still experimenting with the use of puppets at that time anyway, for it to be a real flaw. Jennifer Connelly was absolutely stunning, and amazingly gifted in interpreting the character, I mean, you could really believe that she was that girl so firmly aware of the Goblin King's attempts to sway and seduce her just so he could take Toby away. And Toby - what a cute baby! And Hoggle, what a goblin! Please please, Jareth, take me to the castle beyond the Goblin City. Not to mention the brilliant use of M.C Escher's artwork. I just wish they would re-release it on video, or at least, repeatedly play it on t.v. I hope this wish comes true.",Labyrinth

The parallels between Sara's room and the Labyrinth are so much fun to try and find.  David Bowie as Jareth is supremely mysterious/desirable/evil in the role, but Jennifer Connelly is a little too all-American for Sara and not interested enough in the world she created.",Labyrinth

This movie is one of the deepest films I have ever seen.  In both the Labyrinth and the Dark Crystal, Jim Henson has given us a unique world where anything is possible.  His creative talent and his imagination will forever be remembered in these two spectacular films.  The Labyrinth has one of the best soundtracks that wasn't composed by either James Horner or John Williams. . .and the acting is incredible.  David Bowie really shines as Jareth.  In fact, I couldn't imagine another actor playing that character as well as he did.  This movie ranks right up there with Groundhog Day and the Matrix in terms of spirituality.  There are many, many levels to this film, and it's ashame that very few people understand the complexity of this motion-picture masterpiece.  Since I grew up on this movie, I may be biased in it's favor. . .but even if I were to watch it for the first time in a theater right now, I would have to admit that it's a work of art.",Labyrinth

It has people to look up to, people to love, people to hate, people to be frightened of, things to laugh at, things to sing along too and a true sense of magic and wonder. As an adult it is a film for escaping too, a film to put on when you don't feel well, when your girl/boyfriend just dumped you, when it's raining outside. It reminds you of why you don't want to grow up and of why you did. Plus it is beautifully made with wonderful effects by Jim Henson, magical designs by Brian Froud and a great soundtrack.",Labyrinth
279,Arthur Pewty,Fantastic! What more can I say?,9,13 April 2001,"Well actually I could say a lot more. In fact, I could gab about this film all day! It's magical and mystifying. The whole atmosphere of the film makes you, well me anyway, wish that you could be there. The labyrinth truly is a magical place and a great home for any of us people who like a bit of adventure. Sarah, the young heroine, is played wonderfully and is a really strong character, as is Garret the goblin king, played by David Bowie. David not only delights us with his talented acting but also sings as well! What more could you ask for! The puppeteering is excellent and the sets are transfixing. Being a HUGE Monty Python fan, you would have thought that Terry Jones penning this great film would be the reason for me seeing it, but no, I've been watching this film for 12 years and only realised last year that Monty Python was even loosely connected. This just makes the appeal even stronger though. A must see film which I can't put down in any way. Brilliant!",Labyrinth

The music is great, the scenery is complex, the characters are creative, the costumes are fun, and the story is interesting.While there are some limitations to the special effects because of the year it was created, it is a quality movie. The choice of David Bowie as the Goblin King is fantastic. On the bonus features, they discuss how they wanted to get a current celebrity in the role (such as Michael Jackson), but David Bowie is a perfect fit for such a mysterious character. Of course, the music is all Bowie with interesting lyrics and catchy tunes. What is fun is seeing things repeated in the movie (won't say what, so I won't really spoil it).

If you lay it's elements out it seems to spell disaster. It has juvenile humor yet a fairly dark plot. It is a kids' movie, yet has a young teen in a romantically oriented relationship with an adult with a large power imbalance. Many rules of it's 'world' are left completely unexplained or understood. It is a sort of a lighthearted musical, yet various characters shine lights on deep psychological topics like narcissism or philosophical topics like judging what is important and solving dilemmas.
Labyrinth skates right past all these issues and works very very well. So well, that it can only be described as a work of genius in my view.
Nearly everything about this movie reads to me as a labor of love.",Labyrinth

If there was any way in the world they could recreate it with the technology of today, it should be, but there isn't because the actors would be different. Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie were too great to replace. The music is wonderful, the storyline is unmatched. Something to this quality hasn't been made. Fantasy films aren't around anymore, not like this. If you disregard the lack of technology and budget, and only take in the storyline and music, there should be nothing to judge negatively.Though this movie didn't seem to do very well in the theaters, it has become a cult classic for many, even if they weren't born in the '80s (I was born in 1990).

286,RiotStar-2,Enduring and Engaging,9,21 August 2000,"I first saw 'Labyrinth' when I was 5 years old, and I promptly developed a crush on the Goblin King.  Now that I'm older, I've learned to appreciate the whole picture, not just David Bowie.  'Labyrinth' must have been an incredible undertaking, but the love it was made with shows in every frame. With the exception of Sarah's parents, who are definitely skewed to be the stereotypical nasty stepmom and absentminded dad, all the characters were multi-dimensional, even the king.  The pup- I mean, the Muppets all are original creatures, especially the Fierys ('Let's take off her head!') and the fairys who bite.  The set is amazing, David Bowie steals the show, and you can't help but laugh at all the little touches you don't notice until your 3rd or 4th (or 30th or 40th) viewing.  Jennifer Connelly is a little whiny at first, but gets better as the film goes.  This film used to be impossible to find on video, now you can get it on DVD and VHS.  What I've noticed about this movie is that either you saw it as a kid and LOVED it (acted it out, watched it over and over and over, etc), or you were sorely deprived and can't really get into it now that you're older.  However, everyone who grew up on 'Labyrinth' has a strange,  fanatical devotion to it (much like 'Legend') no matter the quality of the film in others' eyes. It's definitely one to dig out and relive, or show to the kiddies.  It's just scary enough to keep them glued to the screen, there's no annoying slightly slow sidekick to cheese things up (Jar-Jar anyone?), and it definitely fuels the imagination.  The Muppet/Jim Henson movies will endure long after the Pokemon and Power Rangers are in the trash, so just take a deep breath and go rent or buy this movie.",Labyrinth

Bowie is terrific as the ambigous Goblin King, who is neither truly evil nor truly good.  Connely plays her role with aplumb and spunk, and her character Sarah is an conflicted, realistic portrayal of a teenager.  The muppet characters are varied and interesting, and Boggle especially makes you forget that they're not alive.And despite other comments, there is a story.  A simple yet involving one.  Sarah's search for her brother is marked by self-discovery and insights into the nature of life and reality. She is also courted by the Goblin King, who's true nature and intent is left for the viewer to decide.  All in all, a fantastic ride.And the soundtrack is cool.",Labyrinth

He plays the role of the Jareth the Goblin King with style and humor. Jennifer Connolly plays Sarah very well, although the character is sort of a ditz (look closely at some of the choices she makes inside the Labyrinth itself and you will see why I say this).

Of course, whereas ""The Dark Crystal"" was very dark and serious, this movie is very bright and funny and is full of songs by David Bowie, who is also the star villian in the movie (and one of the only three humans that are visible for most of the film).  This is a more family-oriented movie than ""The Dark Crystal"" was and is almost as innovative.  Well worth watching.",Labyrinth
293,Tar-Ancalime,Wonderful movie...,10,2 April 2003,"I first saw this movie in high school, on a bus trip, in a period of my life when I hated all movies and thought they were worthless. Nevertheless, it made so large an impression on me-- despite the fact that the fact that I had been paying it no attention, and trying to study-- that I've always since remembered it. The instant I realized that this film is called ""The Labyrinth"" and stars 'that-one-chick-who-was-in-Beautiful-Mind,' I had to immediately see it again.It's an amazing tapestry of rich characters, original ideas, and brilliant sets. The acting is superb- if Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) annoys some people, it's *because* her acting is superb. She's supposed to be a whiny little teenager. And the Goblin King (David Bowie) is at his best. He's perfect for the part, and his songs range from breath taking to haunting to unutterably beautiful.The film includes funny moments, scary moments, silly moments, and heart-wrenching moments. Every piece of it is woven together to make a truly superb movie. I enjoyed every minute watching this film, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and moving adventure. But I do recommend it ONLY if you have an imagination- the ending seems to baffle those that have no depth of mind. Unexplained details and puzzling, unresolved mysteries only add to the wonder and magic of this film.",Labyrinth
294,faresjcfahd,Speechless... and not in a good way,3,27 August 2013,"When I first decided to watch the Labyrinth, I expected it to be this light fantasy-musical. It disappointed at all levels.For one, it is supposed to be a musical yet it only contains around three horrible songs that add no meaning or artistic touch to the course of events.As well, the course of events is pathetic and shallow. However, amidst a sea of nonsense, you find yourself lost at some points; you go like ""what on Earth is happening right now?!"" Not to mention the bad graphics, even for a 1980s movie. The creatures actually look like puppets and the setting material actually look like cardboard and Styrofoam.The only thing that refrained me from giving this an even lower rating is Jennifer Connelly. Her acting was decent and she looked stunning.All in all, this movie is definitely not worth your time, except if you feel like laughing at how terrible a movie can actually be. 3/10",Labyrinth

297,Brim_and_Brood,A mid-eighties snapshot,8,1 February 2010,"I watched this film for the first time yesterday, which probably makes me unusual in that I am the right age to have seen it as a child. In fact it came out when I was eight years old. I have the advantage, therefore, of watching the film with more mature eyes, without the fear that I will be disappointed.First of all I should say that I don't dislike eighties music, and I think that David Bowie is a talented and capable performer. I am not, however, a great fan of eighties puppetry despite having consumed a large dose of The Muppet Show as a child.Labyrinth is first and foremost a fantasy aimed at children and teenagers, and secondly a coming-of-age story. It succeeds in creating a unique fantasy world, helped by the music, creating an unusual setting and ambiance. I really don't think this film could retain any of its charm without the bold eighties electronic sounds, the sort of sound effects which are more closely associated with science fiction rather than fantasy. David Bowie's androgynous style and exaggerated colours add to the general wackiness. The Goblin King spends his time singing silly songs and experimenting with skin tight trousers. It does become clear that Bowie's character is the classic power-hungry ruler driven by a need to control others.The puppets work well. The directors avoided excessive Muppet Show type ""jumping on the spot"" which has always irritated me in Henson's puppet animators. A lot of effort has clearly gone into the special effects, with the ""heads-off"" dance deserving a particular mention. Today the effects of this particular scene look horrible with so many holes in the presentation it is nearly laughable - but it still works within the film framework and the love and care put into it is clear. Other than that, there are some particularly good effects, for example the door knockers and the final staircase scene at the castle.Jennifer Connoly as the ultra-cute Sarah does her job well, and I think that if asked she could have presented herself as a more mature and able protagonist. It seems to me she was directed to act as an innocent teenager and I think she manages this for the length of the film.The main weakness is story - or lack thereof. The film is not short for what is essentially a trek across difficult terrain. That said the longest story I know about the same thing is the Lord of the Rings. Labyrinth, like the Lord of the Rings, manages to fill most of its time with interesting non-events, which seem important to give reason for the final evolution of Sarah's character; much as Tolkien's trilogy built up to Frodo's final decision to leave his home and friends behind. But the story remains that of a long trek, with adversity, until the final confrontation with the bad guy. Tolkien's story is, of course, richer in print, but no such thing exists for Labyrinth as far as I am aware.The second weakness of the film is its submission to Hollywood standards of one-liners and absurd battle scenes. These have been staples of the American motion picture industry for at least 30 years and they are more childish than a talking worm. It was excruciating having to put up with this towards the end of the film.I struggled with a score for Labyrinth. If I were an adult seeing it in 1986 I probably would have hated it for reasons already put forward by other reviewers. I am being generous giving it 8 out of 10. This score is for a combination of an above average and entertaining film, which is unique and unrepeated, a representative of a time long past, and deserving of a special place in motion picture history.",Labyrinth
298,Cural,Still my favorite movie of all time!,10,29 December 1998,"Well, I just saw the movie again, perhaps for the 10th or 15th time, and I just have to say that I never tire of it.  Certainly one of the best done movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movie soundtracks that has ever existed.  (Certainly the only movie soundtrack I can think of that I would actually pay money to get, as I have to like all songs on a CD before I buy it.)  David Bowie is excellent as Jareth, the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly is certainly one of the better movie heroines I've seen.  She's not the passive type who cries about broken nails or screams and screeches after everything that happens to her.  Although she is a tad unwise, as is evidenced by her rather poor answer to Jareth's question on how she likes the Labyrinth -- ""It's a piece of cake.""  And great performances by the people responsible for Hoggle, Sir Didymus, and Ludo.  Unlike others, I enjoyed the ballroom scene, and the song ""As the World Falls Down"" is my favorite off the soundtrack.  This slower scene is a refreshing break from the faster pace of the rest of the movie, and I love the way the scene is ended.  The end of the movie, when Sarah enters the castle, was particularly great.  I loved the way the stairs and doorways and everything are all over the place, upside-down, sideways, or whatever, and it seemed that only Sarah was unable to walk upside-down.  And David gives off a great performance in the end, as he tries to stop Sarah from finishing the poem that will undo him.  As one last note about the movie, I would like to bring up a topic somebody else mentioned in one of the reviews on this site -- a Labyrinth 2. Personally, I think this would be a BAD idea.  So rarely does a sequel ever live up to the original, as has been evidenced so often when a sequel bombs. I've so rarely seen a sequel that works, and even then they are rarely as good as the original.  While I would love to see the sequel if it were as good as the original, I doubt if that will ever happen.  My only complaint is that the IMDB's voting options only go as high as 10.",Labyrinth

However, my sister used to always babysit me on friday nights, and play one of the movies that I enjoyed but she hated, and so I tended to watch the movie quite a lot.1992, I became of an age in which I remember things. I remember jumpin around and dancing to 'The Magic Dance' and getting down with 'Chilly Down.' I remember renting it every chance I had the chance. Everyone else in my family hated it so, but I remember watching it fondly, and people said I was going to break it for watching it so much.It came after a while that my family took all the toys out of my room and told me to grow up. I was 9 years old. Labyrinth became a memory that I rarely had.I recently got a job babysitting, and it a child who was 7 years old. The day I got my first 20 dollars for it, I went on to the movie site, and there Labyrinth was, in all of its glory.

302,midflinx007,Meaning within the pages,8,13 June 2002,"Jennifer Connelly was just starting her career when she made Labyrinth. Unfortunately it shows.  As Sarah, her acting has its moments, and though she has sub-par dialog, her character grew on me.  The sets are incredibly colorful and fairy-tale-like.  However, they look cramped and fake.  This unusual world tells a rarely told story in movies, one of growing up from a child into an adult.  Sarah begins the story still in her fairy-tale world. Her room is a beautiful collection of childhood dolls, figures, and toys. New posters of plays and actresses are also apparent, however.  Suffering, babysitting Toby every weekend, ""its not fair!,"" she cries, and she's right. Inside the labyrinth she realizes life isn't fair.  Life is complex, bewildering, full of choices and decisions.  **If the other user comments haven't spoiled the ending yet, stop reading.**  By the end Sarah has her baby brother back, and for it given up a romance with an unusual prince-charming.  She hands Toby her teddy bear Lancelot to keep, then goes to her room alone.  In the mirror her Labyrinth friends appear.  She realizes that while growing up is hard, her friends and her childhood memories will still be there for her.",Labyrinth

The surrealist fantastical adventure left me feeling warped and is probably a huge contribution to my deteriorating mental health. Why is this film so good? Well, you have a goblin king played by David Bowie. (Genuinely scary, not just for kids, for god's sake just look at how tight his trousers are...) You have talking worms, monsters who can tear themseleves apart and put their legs on their necks, ogres who can call on rocks and boulders, excellent music (once again, that mental deterioration thing again, I won't ever recover from when i saw him sing jump magic), dogs on top of other dogs, and a little guy called Hoggle.This is just the tip of the ice-berg.This is a very funny film witha lot of seriously messed up things in it... ..watch this or i'll throw you into the bog of eternal stench.",Labyrinth

There is something both whimsical and moving about the combination of Bowie, muppets, and a fairy-tale story that never loses its appeal. It is a perfect fit for my unit on archetypes (with a female hero, no less), and my son at 5 used to ask ""Can we watch the movie about the goblin king?""

It has this magical fairy tale quality to it, but with a lot of more mature humor. It's not a bad movie for kids, but some parents might not appreciate the tainted fairy tale humor, for example; near the beginning when Sarah sees a strange creature swatting fairies out of the sky and he explains it's because they bite (they seam to be some kind of mosquito). The story itself is pretty involving, and David Bowie's music certainly doesn't hurt. There are a few scenes that could have been scary had they been presented differently, but in this movie they just come out kind of weird. You don't have to worry about giving your kids nightmares. There are a lot of cool special effects that add to the surrealism of the movie, particularly the final battle between Sarah and the Goblin King.

I saw the Dark Crystal later (I was still only about 7) but as I hadn't 'grown up' on it I didn't like it as much, mostly because of how dark it was so it scared me a bit.  However Labyrinth was pretty scary too.  It was my first knowledge of David Bowie and that is always my first image when I hear his name.

Everything about the film screams with nostalgia and just makes me beam with happiness.The character of Sarah with her dolls and costumes and her lipstick, reminds me how much I wanted to grow up to be like her.I think its a shame such a well made, fantasy film didn't receive more credit, or maybe it did and I was just too young to remember.

For myself, I watched this movie at least, 10 times and never, I got fed up! So, This story told about a teenager girl who is a little jealous of her younger brother who still a baby. Indeed, her parents love very much their daughter but they come to have their second kid and have less time spending with her. So, Sarah, acted by Jennifer Connelly, get to keep her brother for a night and don't feel like that at all. She yelled after him and are offensive. Then, a mysterious lightning and a thunder occurred. So, when Sarah reach at the brother's room, she realizes he is not there anymore!

If you're a Bowie fan and have not seen this movie, what on earth are you waiting for!? If you're not, and you don't mind a little 80's cheese, this film is great. I love the sets that they built, and all the little critters they created for the film.  My favorite part of the whole film is the ballroom scene, it's just so beautifully done. From Hoggle and Ludo, to the Fire Guys and the Bog of Eternal Stench, this film can carry your mind away into a different realm and make you daydream about wishing away morons in your own life to the Goblin City, where you would never have to see them again!

I was about 10 years old the first time I saw it and it made such an impact on me that I ended up ordering it from Germany just 12 years old. The setting is fantastic; it's just scary enough without making scares in a young boy's soul. Bowie acts in a trilling way, and his unique and magical voice brings it all together. If you like fantasy you will love this film. All the Quotes make Bowie as Jareth ""the Goblin King"" the perfect villain. At times you almost despise him but as I wrote in my first sentence, nothing is like it seems. And as I grow older I sympathized with him, you may even say that he tries to help Sarah.

Not that that's a problem, of course.But, the diabolical 'songs' showcased during the film are incredibly awful, to the point where you wonder what was in your last drink. Not only that, but one or two weird random sequences completely ruin the rhythm and flow of the storyline, and had me puzzled as to why they were even there. That's a pity because this would otherwise have had the potential to rank alongside Neverending Story in my opinion.I will say that David Bowie does a pretty good job and looks the part, unfortunately the effect of the 'little girl lost' is rather lost itself as she is surrounded by creatures nearly all much shorter than she is, making her look tall and capable of defeating anything, which probably wasn't the idea.This film is definitely better viewed as an adult if only to capitalise on the many witty lines dealt throughout by the various characters.

Even at that, none of the obstacles he presented were insurmountable as long as Sarah kept thinking and kept her mind on what the ultimate goal was.Some people seem to get completely 'stuck' on the issue of the age difference between them - but that again goes back to classic fairy tales, age and experience v. youth and enthusiasm.Overall, an excellent tale, well played and I believe seriously under appreciated.",Labyrinth

I think I like it so much because the entire movie is sort of infused with the wild weirdness of glam rock. The other reason it's so dear to me is that it's really pretty deep for a kid's movie. And very dark. When I was actually a child, ""Labyrinth"" scared the hell out of me, but I still loved it. The film's world is both fantastic, and wonderfully realized. For me, Jareth the Goblin King is the central expression of the world. He's sophisticated and intelligent, and makes a very good villain. Yet, he seems more bored than megalomanical, and sort of gently despairing about the lameness of his henchmen. He's a little like Maleficent from Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"", and ""Labyrinth"" has a similar timeless effect, with many adults still enjoying it.",Labyrinth

328,Valeyard-2,"Well, yet another great fantasy film that almost disappeared forever.",8,17 October 1999,"Thank goodness for DVD, I have been trying to get a good copy of this for years.I still cannot believe how many people do not know that this movie exists. I wonder if this film would have ever been released if it was not for the current trend in cult releases on DVD and tape. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it is definitely one of the best fantasy films of modern cinema. Sure, maybe some of the effects may be dated by today's standards or the film may have been marketed for children, but ... who cares? The work on the design of this production alone should have won it several awards, David Bowie's performance still stands out as incredible, and the story itself is a lot deeper than most will admit. But hey, at least that fact has not hurt the film's popularity. Only something as well done as this could withstand the tests of time in a film industry like ours.Regardless of anyone who might disagree as to how good or bad Labyrinth is, no one can deny it's power to generate a fan base that could survive without any means to purchase a copy for so long. Only something that can touch people's hearts and minds could do something like that. The eighties heralded so many well done fantasy productions that I wish it would become a filmmaking trend again someday. Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, The Princess Bride, Return to Oz, and Legend were truly some of the most painstakingly detailed, amazingly directed, and beautifully scored films that I can think of. I may have originally viewed them as a young child, but over the years not one of them has disappeared from my memories. As one grows older one forgets the unmemorable, but not works of art like these. After just viewing Labyrinth again, I can see that even though I've grown and I've learned many things about filmmaking itself, this movie still amazes me. Even if some have a problem with the pace or are avid haters of muppets, they should sit down and give this film a chance. At times it almost seems as if the characters in the film are just walking through a wonderfully done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings. There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth. One might think that Bowie's music, having been a fad of the eighties, would have also been awkward after a decade or so, but that is not the case either. The music just seems to fit as if it were never part of the real world at all but just more of what one would expect from mischievous goblins out to have fun or Jareth's attempts at wooing the heroine. If I had to pick one thing about this film that will truly leave anyone in awe, it is the ballroom sequence. I have not seen many films in my life that have given a feel of a hypnotizing dream like Frank Oz and Jim Henson did in that scene. The symbolism equally matched with a romanticized score, perfectly timed dance choreography and unbelievable costume designing make for one of the grandest scenes I have ever viewed.I'm very happy that now after more than a decade, this film has been restored and given a chance at new life. Maybe now more will learn of it and give it the appreciation it deserves.",Labyrinth

Little needs to be said of Bowie's part as Jareth, the Goblin King. Every line he utters leaves you laughing, or at least grinning. He's evil yet irresistable, charming, graceful, and just about everything else. The music of this film is also great. The soundtrack lives in my cd player.

David Bowie performs all of the vocal tracks and does a terrific job.  Sure the songs can be kind of cheesy, but they're definitely the kind of songs that you will find yourself humming for weeks afterwards.  The second thing that needs to be mentioned is the overall look of the film. It is just beautiful.  The sets and back-drops are lavish, and all of the puppet characters are done by the Jim Henson team (nuff said right?)  The story is not too incredibly thought provoking, good triumphing over evil, but it is fairly solid and enjoyable.  The music and the visuals more than pick up the slack that the story line creates though.  I think that anyone who is a sci-fi Fantasy film fan owes it to themselves to see this movie at least once.  In comparison to other films, it is more fantastic (fantasy) than Willow but not as epic.  It is less fantastic than Legend, but definitely easier to follow.

I never actually considered the fact that it was a Jim Henson film because I didn't see the opening credits, but the film was incredible.  It has just about anything and everything required to make an ultimate effect on people out of a fantasy movie.  It has kings, goblins, a damsel in distress, and most of all, it has a great cast.  David Bowie makes a very lasting impression for people who have seen this movie, the tights, people, but of course that is very obvious.  He also makes one heck of a villain and makes the Goblin King truly as dark and shadowy as his name.  Jennifer Connelly, who plays the role of Sarah, who truly has a personae that anyone watching the movie should be able to empathize with.  For those of you who haven't watched it, Toby should've had his, but then again, I do have a younger brother, too. In any case, the muppet characters are incredible, truly one of Jim Henson's masterpieces.  The soundtrack is a must buy because David Bowie just transforms the atmosphere of the movie into one of an ampetheater of fantasy which gives life to the film.This movie is a 1986 film, but it has timeless quality because so little of it involves things that change through time. I feel that people should watch this movie at least once in their lives, it's one of those, ""I never knew people would have  made a movie about this""- kind of movies.",Labyrinth

It an all round great film - if you just take it for what it is, its a kids film, which its good as. But when you really take it in, this film is so much deeper than it seems.The whole meaning of the film is Sarah going through adolescence. She learns so much about herself, comes to terms with her family, and has her first love in the form of King Jareth. Anyone who loves this film will have wanted Jareth and Sarah to get together, and thats the sad thing, they're separated forever - Sarah chooses to save her brother instead of stay with the one she loves.Also, the imagination is this movie is great - they pull off the puppets so well, and its hard to believe that this was a 1986 film! The owl in the beginning sequence was the first ever 3D computer animated thing in a film. And yet this is a cult classic, sadly not a huge well known blockbuster. The soundtrack is great, some of Bowie's best work. Even if it wasn't a film soundtrack, these songs would be great.

342,corporate_spice,The mark that Lord of the Rings must meet,10,28 November 2001,"A tour-de-force for Jim Henson and his studio.Jennifer Connolley leads this cast of 5 humans, 1 Dog and more puppets than you can count. In the role of Sarah she does a splendid performance of a introverted yet willful teenager put through the challenge of surviving her own imagination. The peak of her performance is the Ballroom scene. I would say the Jennifer has never looked better in any other film.David Bowie hams it up a treat. Remember this is primarily a childrens' film, so his performance is spot on. He plays the fascinating and semi-evil Goblin King (Why he too is not a goblin is unaddressed ;-)) with a wry and distinctly flowery style.The puppetry is brilliant with Jim Henson once again proving himself to be the best in the business.No fantasy film since has surpassed Labyrinth in terms of imagination and charm. I look forward to the new batch of fantasy (Harry Potter & LOTR) but still they are hardly original works.",Labyrinth

I may be slightly biased as I first saw it when I was three and have loved it ever since. May be it is more suitable for children seeing as it is all fantasy? However, even now at sixteen years old I still love the movie.Both David Bowie and Jennifer Connolly give fantastic performances and teamed with an action packed storyline this film is far from boring.However, I realise that this film isn't everyone's cup of tea. The viewer would need to be able to suspend their disbelief in order to follow the movie and really get into the concept of it all.

Not only was it wonderful when I was seven, but it is still wonderful today.  Labyrinth was one of the fantasy movies put out in the mid-80's, others would include Princess Bride, Willow, Legend, Krull and Dark Crystal (which are all good movies) however, Labyrinth was a step above the rest.  The soundtrack is great, most songs are by David Bowie and the characters (mostly muppets) are very lovable. Although the plot is simple the movie is incredibly entertaining.",Labyrinth

The qoutes are amazing from the little worm and weve all been doin impressions of the junk lady, 'OOOOOhhhh you like your dolly'.If you haven't seen this film get it if only for David Bowie singing 'Dance magic dance'.The basic plot is this girl who has her brother stolen by goblins and has to try and solve a labyrinth to save him. Forget the plot though and enjoy a film for all the family.Kid's will love it as well as adults who will be in tears at some of the profanity like hoggle having a wee.This film sums up the 80's because its so bad its brilliant all I can say in the words of that little rat thing is 'come along Abmrosius'.",Labyrinth
347,brindle_greyhound,Good fun...,8,3 September 2007,"This movie is--very 80s and very glittery. And you can't help but love it.I wish that filmmakers nowadays would make children's movies more along these lines. Slightly dark, but magical and intelligent instead of bland and overly polished. This movie is far more lighthearted than The Dark Crystal, another Henson production.I love Bowie as Jareth; you can tell he loved being Jareth. His costumes are glam rock, his tights--very tight, make up over the top, and his hair crazy but it all fits the character well. I do think his acting is slightly underrated for this film. He exudes confidence despite some very cheesy dialog and plays the role well. Some of the songs are almost embarrassing and unnecessary, such as ""Dance Magic"" or the firey sequence, but they are made up for by the wonderful Escher scene.Connelly is fine as Sarah--though a little overacted at times.The puppetry is great fun, as are the little details sprinkled throughout the film.It does seem somewhat dated, the outfits, songs and soundtrack are plucked straight from the 80s, but that is part of the charm. I never saw it when I was a kid, and have only recently discovered it. It is good fun. I have read some reviewers saying that this movie isn't for children because of the underlying ""tension"" between 15 year old Sarah and much older Jareth. It is subtle (would go unnoticed by little kids), and one sided. Jareth is trying to seduce her , but she never reciprocates (he never gropes her and never tries to kiss her). Even when they dance in the ball room there is the 6-12 inches of clearance between them. There is not much about this movie that is horribly inappropriate for children, maybe for very sensitive young ones, but that is it. Lighten up.",Labyrinth

That's for anyone who sees this movie and thinks it's automatically stupid or for kids because Jim Henson made it. In reality, this is a great, classic movie that I grew up with and still watch.Basically it's the story of a girl named Sarah who lives within her own fantasies and daydreams. But when the King of the Goblins steals her baby brother after she wishes him away, she has to solve his Labyrinth in order to get him back.I love the friends she makes. They could have been stereotypical, but the cowardly Hoggle, gentle Ludo and well-meaning Sir Didymus make you wonder who she'll meet next.But the main attraction is David Bowie, who plays Jareth the Goblin King. He does a great job, and the songs are beautiful and I recommend you listen closely to them if you get a chance.Overall, if you're willing to just relax and watch a fun movie, go for this one. If you're a cynical person where nothing is ever good enough in the first place, don't bother.",Labyrinth

I remember loving the bloke in tights that I now know to be Bowie.I did not see the film again until last year just after my 17th, At first I did not recognise it, but then the goblin king entered the room and I knew exactly what the film was.I love this film, it creates fantasy in with role play as well as a hidden love story. It represents growing up and ageing from a child in to an adult, taking hold of responsibility and dealing with life.Sarah, the young girl is an innocent who always thinks of herself, her father is getting remarried and she is uncomfortable with this, to get away she dissapeers into the fantasy of her favorite book the labyritnth. Yet she gets more than she bargins for when she wishes her baby brother away and he goes to the goblin kings castle, she must solve the labyrinth along the way but Jareth (the goblin king) is always around the next corner trying to stop her from achieveing her goal. The love story is between Sarah and Jareth, they both feel for each other but there is something in the way for each of them, Jareth is portrayed as evil to sarah, and sarah wants her baby brother back, they can never fall in love!In the film there are 5 songs by bowie, 3 are performed, they are very good songs, 2 can be found on the best of bowie dvd. The other songs are by trevor jones, also very good.Since growing older and realising who Jareth was I have become a keen fan of david bowie and love all of his music and films that I have made a point of collecting.The labyrinth on the other hand I have worn a few tapes of out and I often wish the goblin king would come and take me away, I loved this film then and I love it now, It comes highly recommended, a definate 10 star award!",Labyrinth

I cant fathom people that do not like the songs, they are the best bits in the movie, especially the song at the end, when sarah is running around on the stairs, and the song that is playing when Sarah and Jarith are dancing.

353,adbento,One of the worst films ever.,1,5 May 2004,"Labyrinth is one of those rare movies that manages to get everything wrong. The writing is horrid; the environments (which should, given that this is a fantasy film, be colorful and interesting) are filled with boring brown colors.  The music in this quazi-musical is so bad, that is nearly comical. Even David Bowie fans will cringe in disgust during some of his numbers. Furthermore, the story makes very little sense; I suspect even toddlers would be able to find plot holes.  Finally, the acting stands out as the worst aspect of the film.  During the film's title sequence, when Jennifer Connelly's name appeared, I thought that perhaps she would be able to carry the movie.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  I know the material she had to work with was god-awful, but her pathetic over-acting made David Bowie look like Tom Hanks.I know this is a children's film and that many adults, remembering the wonderful impression the movie left them with when they were kids, consider watching this movie for nostalgic purposes.  I have only one word for these people: don't.  Don't ruin your childhood memory of this movie, because the only way you'll enjoy Labyrinth today is under a mind-altering substance.

After re-watching it ten years later I found that it was still an amazing feat of puppet wizardry with a typically Terry Jonesish screenplay. And being the Henson/Monty Python fiend that I am, I had a very pleasant ninety eight minutes.However I found myself feeling terribly embarrassed for David Bowie (an excuse to wear weird costumes and make up gone horribly wrong). Referring to the trouser department, I was nearly shouting ""For God's sake! Put it away! You'll scare the kiddies!"" Not to mention the crazy hair and the Cuban heels which all in all made him look disturbingly like one of my ex French teachers called Madame Zaza.Personal issues aside, this film is very good and I would highly recommend it to...anyone whose interested in that sort of thing. It is also a good lesson to younger children about the evils of 80's fashion.Remember. If the hairdresser suggests a mullet: Just Say ""NO""!",Labyrinth

365,srjamnik,"great Movie, a little cheesy",9,15 July 2005,"The Labyrinth by Jim Henson is a delightful combination of children's fantasy and the 80's pop culture, but this is evident even before you see the movie, because the film boasts David Bowie as its leading man... or lady? Despite disturbing images of Bowie's lavish groin region, the film is surprisingly good. The only downfall may be the corny looking puppets. The goblin puppets in this movie look as revolting as Jim Henson's puke after a heavy night of drinking.Here's the plot summary: A young girl named Sarah (Jennifer Connoley) struggles to get along with her ""wicked"" step-mother, who actually seems to be really a nice person. Sarah finds her refuge in children's fantasy novels and dreams of becoming an actress, like her late mother. One night, while her father and step-mother are out on a date, Sarah is charged to look after her baby brother Toby, who has stolen one of her dolls and will not stop crying. In a fit of rage and over-dramatics, Sarah proclaims her wish for the Goblin king to take Toby away forever. Much to her surprise, this happens, and now she must reach the Goblins' Castle in the middle of a gigantic labyrinth to save her baby brother. The Labyrinth is very well done and couples the zany antics of Jim Henson to the musical genius of David Bowie, who creates a very good soundtrack for the film. The pace moves very well and is enjoyable for audiences both young and old. The tow small errors in this movie are these; 1. Jennifer Connoley's acting is a bit over done, but really not that bad. 2. The puppets are so cheesy and ugly that some scenes are hard to watch. All in all, The Labyrinth is a great movie and fun to watch.",Labyrinth

Labyrinth takes you to an underworld, where the clock strikes 13 and the way forwards is sometimes the way back. Sarah, a young girl wishing she lived in a fantasy world gets her wish when she tells her baby brother a make-believe story which becomes true. By saying the words ""I wish the goblin king would take you away, right now"", Sarah gave the Goblin king the power to do just that. Instantly Sarah finds herself underground begging the king for her brothers return. The Goblin King gives her 13 hrs to solve the Labyrinth before her baby brother becomes a goblin forever. Sarah faces an exciting journey full of fantasy, and adversity as she makes her way through the labyrinth meeting various friends (hoggle, ludo, sir didamus) along the way. In the world where walls move, fruits drug, and rocks are friends Sarah learns not to take things for granted, and most importantly that life isn't fair, but that's the way it is. David Bowie, who plays the Goblin King, also does the soundtrack. Every song is integral to the movie, and literally part of the script for example: ""How you turn my world, you precious thing. You starve and near exhaust me. Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one."" shows how he truly believes he loves her and is giving her what she wants by being cruel. When not singing, his acting is perfect, the taunting way he tries to seduce Sarah while never relinquishing control, allows you to feel his power. ""Just love me, fear me, do as I say, and I will be your slave. Look what I'm offering you... your dreams"". Makes you almost wish she'd give in. The ending is perfect as she realizes all he is offering is a dream and she can finally say ""You have no power over me!"". I can literally recite this movie word for word, lyric for lyric, and I'd still watch it a hundred more times! You won't just watch Labyrinth, you'll be engulfed by it :)",Labyrinth

David Bowie is a dreamboat and demonstrates unspeakable talent in both his acting and his singing... and dancing. I know many women who, after seeing the movie, have developed obsessive crushes on David. We sometimes have parties themed around the movie to celebrate its excellence. It's also a great icebreaker when trying to hook up with men. I guarantee that you will love it! Here is a breakdown of the plot: An ugly girl named Sarah is wishing doom upon her baby brother, so naturally, the Goblin King comes to the rescue, kidnapping the infant. Jareth (Bowie) dances lovingly with the lucky baby and his devilish minions, while unfortunate Sarah has to find her way through the conundrum that is the Labyrinth. She comes upon many mysterious creatures. Some (like me and my friends) have the ability to take off their heads and throw them around. Sarah meets ""helping hands"" and magical dogs. There is also a beautiful romance written into this adventurous tale. The love between Jareth and Sarah is the purest love I have ever witnessed, and don't quote me on this, but sometimes I imagine I am Sarah... standing on the stair-steps, waiting for Jareth's body to defy gravity and walk up from his position standing on the ceiling underneath the platform.

What are you thinking! This movie should be at least a 9/10! First of all...The world created for Labyrinth it's absolutely real. You can sense it, you can smell it. It's warm and natural, full of signs and symbols, and every corner has a secret to tell, and believe when I say that not even the most expensive and newest FXs could approach to Labyrinth's level.Characters, both, actors and ""puppets"", are terrific. One of the things I love most of this film is that there is not such thing as a bad guy, an evil lord, or a terrible villain with a scar on his face. They are not recurring stereotypes. Sarah is like any normal girl of her age; she can act like an arrogant selfish bad-mannered teenager but she is a good and sweet person too. The same goes for the Goblin king: he doesn't have any evil motivation for doing what he does; at the beginning he is just trying to help Sarah by making her wish come true. There is this little spark of innocence shining within each one of them that makes you get involved with them.Beautiful for adults and children. I remark this because nowadays it's quite difficult to find a movie easy enjoyable for all ages, when most of the films made for kids are just stupid.This movie has nothing to envy to any other fantasy film.

The character, Sarah, the selfish brat, wished her little brother into a bad place and then had to go through hell to get him back. But what's cool is how she grew up in the process. I see the symbolism of how we grow up as well in this film and that's what touches me.I don't know if many people know this but Labyrinth was a box office dud, returning only 50% of the budget they spent, and threw Jim Henson into a depression. It ended up being the last feature film directed by Jim before he died in 1990. A sad story behind a pretty good film that didn't get the attention that it deserved. now of course it's a huge cult film, as with so many great artists, not really recognized until after Henson's death. (although he had of lot of success in his lifetime!) RIP.",Labyrinth
375,Cheryl-7,"A wonderful fairy-tale adventure, one of Henson's best, a must see!!!",10,15 January 1999,"Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I have loved it. The puppeteering is absolutely magical and the plot is fun and witty! Jim Henson did an excellent job with the creatures in this film. Though strange at time (i.e. a blue haired worm and a firey red, head-throwing monster), they were all quite believable in the frame of the story and very entertaining! David Bowie also did an excellent job with his role as the Goblin King. His songs were wonderful..ranging from the humorous (Magic Dance), to the enchanting (As the World Falls Down). The movie is a must see for anyone, both children and adults!",Labyrinth
376,Grey-8,wot i fink 'bout labyrinth,10,19 November 1998,"Wow, David Bowie in leggings, my how tight they were, interesting hair style too.  Labyrinth is my favorite film ever, not only for the above observations, but just for it's pure skill at being a film.  And it's not just me who thinks that, I have a large group of friends, who, between us can recreate the entire script of Labyrinth, should we choose to do so.  The only other thing I have to say is ""Nothing, nothing, nothing, Tra laa laa.""",Labyrinth
377,Natsirt,"A Movie For the 80's Born Generation, and Kids Everywhere",10,20 June 2000,"For me this movie ranks up there with Goonies in nostalgic value alone, and that's saying a lot. Like most people born in the 80's they've seen it countless times, and have something of a love affair with it. While on the other hand people not born in the 80's or not a kid right now seem to look at it for the most part as if it were stupid. Roger Ebert for example gave it Two Stars, saying there was no strong plot line, and it dragged on to long. While I usually respect Ebert's reviews he totally missed the entire charm, and deeper meaning of the movie.This is anomaly of sorts. While browsing through the comments here I've seen numerous accounts of people who rank this movie as one of their favourite movies ever, while others make the same comments as Ebert.
100 Goblins to one I can guarantee you that anyone who makes primarily negative comments about this movie wasn't born in the 80's. Not to say their comments are wrong, but they don't see the childish charm within the movie, and instead concentrate their comments with a objective ""adult"" point of view.So what's the moral of the story? Stop thinking like an adult, and start imagining like a kid.Ohh, and I gave this movie 10/10. If only for Jennifer Connelly's performance alone, nevermind Jim Henson's masterful puppets.",Labyrinth

379,Mookey,Under-rated. Over-looked. But incredible!,10,4 March 1999,"The technical wizardry and un-paralleled imagination of Muppet master Jim Henson. The celluloid and soundtrack appearance of one-time Ziggy Stardust, David Bowie. The sparkling wit of Monty Python graduate Terry Jones. The enchanting Jennifer Connelly. What more COULD you wish for?A lot more, it would seem, as ""Labyrinth"" remains one of the most criminally misunderstood and under-appreciated films in the history of cinema. Ignored on initial realease, derided by critics for it's lack of brevity and narrative core(!), and since sniggered at for Bowie's eye-catching wig and leg-wear. But WHY?""Labyrinth"" has managed to survive such adversity and live on in the hearts and minds of cinema-goers and children of all ages because it is a blissfuly innocent and compelling modern fairy tale; a true cinematic gem bursting with spectachular set-pieces( from the gravity-defying Escher room to the sumptuous wonder of the ball-room bubble), a breath-taking gallery of incredible creatures( remember the jive-talkin', limb-swappin' Fireys, or the l'il tea-slurping worm?),haunting Bowie-tastic songs, a captivating heroine in the form of Jennifer Connelly and a devilishly love-lorn Goblin King in the form of David Bowie. The story of Sarah( Connelly )venturing into the wickedly deceptive Labyrinth to rescue her baby brother( baby-sitting has never been THIS compelling! ) from the clutches of a Goblin King( Bowie )and his army of ranting urchin goblins is not just an exciting adventure story, packed with as much humour, suspense and time-honoured family values as you can fit into 101 minutes, but also a beautifully handled coming-of-age story, detailing Sarah's venture into the equally unknown area of womanhood.Let's hope such a movie as ""Labyrinth"" is never forgotten. It certainly won't be if I get my wish!",Labyrinth

It has that ""Peter Pan"" type of story in which one wishes to escape from reality and have a fantastic adventure.  The master Jim Henson creates puppet characters that entertain and amuse like no other and  seem no less lifelike than the human characters.  That is no small feat.

395,dedepexa,Wonderous world of the labyrinth,10,23 January 2020,"Labyrinth is a musical fantasy with weird creatures and over dramatic acting. This cult film is about a young woman who basically hates her baby brother so she wishes for a goblin king to take him. Simple and easy until you realize that this goblin king is the iconic David Bowie and he has an army of goblins holding her brother hostage in a castle in the middle of a very confusing and frankly annoying labyrinth. Sarah who is the young woman I've been talking about decides she wants to save her baby brother but to save him she has to solve the goblin king's labyrinth. Sarah is given 13 hours to get Toby (her baby brother) or he turns into a goblin.
This film has very wondrous creatures from Ludo who is the literal definition of a gentle giant and Hoggle who is a very grouchy dwarf. These two try to help Sarah solve the labyrinth but Ludo doesn't really know how to speak and Hoggle is essentially Jareth's (David Bowie) slave. He wants to be Sarah's friend but every so often Jareth will threaten him and at one point gives him a peach to poison Sarah with. Spoiler alert... she eats it and goes into a bizarre dream world where she is in a glass bubble and there's a masquerade. She dances and it's all a dark illusion. Sarah realizes this and smashes a chair into the wall which is a mirror, which is also the bubble that she's in but not really because it's all in her mind. Confusing but makes sense when it's watched and makes a very eerie atmosphere for the movie.
Labyrinth has many spectacular hidden things I guess I could say that most people don't really notice or think about because they probably aren't a diehard David Bowie or Jim Henson fan like me. Most all of the characters other than Sarah, David, Toby and the parents who you really don't see are puppets! With this information I think all the cheesy and odd moments are made up for. Ludo is a gigantic puppet made by the exemplary Jim Henson who made the muppets. Me being a nerd I've watched hours of behind the scenes and let me just say. The work these artists do is amazing and should be respected even if you don't like the movie that they made.
Labyrinth is very odd and isn't for everyone. Most people don't like the production value and the terrible cgi. Just keep in mind if you want to watch this movie that it is made in 1986 so it's not going to have amazing visual effects and beautiful production value that some films might have today. I will say that it is quite impressive the amount of effort that is in every scene in this movie. Most everything is made by hand, from the trees to the very ominous rocks with faces that say creepy things like ""turn back before it's too late"" and ""go no further"". You realize later that they are just excited to say these things because it's their job to scare people out of the labyrinth and they haven't had visitors in a long time.
Another important part of this film is the soundtrack. This film is loaded with hits. I myself have the whole soundtrack on my phone because it's so good. It's definitely not for everyone but I feel like throughout the movie you'll find at least one song that you'll like. There's upbeat music like magic dance for when Jareth is celebrity with the goblins and Toby but there's also slower music like Within you which is played near the end of the movie where Jareth is singing to Sarah.
With this film you have to keep your mind open to very odd things but I definitely recommend it to everyone. I think it's a movie that everyone should give a chance because it really is a classic and in my opinion it's amazing. It's obviously one of my favorites but I know that there are many things that people don't really agree with or like in this movie. I would relate this movie to Alive and Wonderland because of the odd and quirkiness to it. Now go give labyrinth a chance because I don't think you'll regret it but you might so it's really up to you.",Labyrinth

Forever. It's like one of the best movies ever made :) :) :)!!! I think movies like this is what gave me my strange and unique creativity. I'm a lyricist and poet and a KIND OF artist. I also really like the Escher Scene. The music in this movie is AWESOME!!! I usually like really really rockish stuff and loud music, but I do like some oldish stuff too. The 80's seemed coolish...I like the unusual hairstyles from then...XD but ya...I mean I don't really like very many new movies. They are mostly all about the same thing. The only ones I really like are horror stuff like Vampires and Zombies, but thats all.

420,bethiepoo,Top Favorite movie!!!,10,19 November 2003,"One of my all time favorite movies!  You can't beat the Jim Henson Creature Shop creations such as Hoggle, Sir Diddimus, and especially adorable Ludo!!! And the perfection that David Bowie brings to the Goblin King is immeasurable!!!  A definite must for anyone who likes fantasy genre.  If you want to see where fantasy got it's start in the movie business before Lord of the Rings, this is THE movie.  The music in and of its self is worth it alone!",Labyrinth
421,eveline_lee,My fav movie of all time,10,12 November 2009,"I just love Labyrinth! It's really a classic and it brings back the good old days before CGI. And the moral is, nothing can replace great storytelling magic. Long live Jim Henson! Man, it's really got to be the highest point in his career, the muppets are so so real. I just love the way he breathes life into them! And they are all so unique! The storyline in Labyrinth is great and multi-layered - definitely a bit too complex for a child to understand. When I first watched it, I was 12 and it scared the hell out of me! And it was great to revisit it 20 years later and find that you have progressed and that you can understand the multi-fold depths of the film.I think David Bowie did a fantastic job (and I'm not even a David Bowie fan) playing a charismatic, manipulative and yet sympathetic villain. He did so great a job that at the end you are left feeling sorry for him, cos he didn't do anything wrong - he liked Sarah, he granted her first wish to take Toby away, gave her a second chance to get Toby back... he wanted to love beneath his seemingly evil facade. And I thought the songs were real good. the depths of the lyrics, wow, I didn't know David Bowie can be so profound! I found Sarah so courageous. It really strikes me, and how in the end she chose to face womanhood and adulthood maturely, accepting responsibility. I would have taken the easy way and stayed with Jareth, knowing that I'll get all my wishes granted.I think it's a great great movie, very profound and moving even though it's filled with muppets and targeted at kids being in the fantasy genre. It's definitely not dark, it's just deep. I actually rewatched to confront my childhood fears, didn't expect to stumble upon a cult of Labyrinth fans and even more rabid David Bowie fans who imagine fantasies of what could have been and what if Sarah ended up with Jareth. Hmm, wonder if they would feel the same way if Jareth didn't look like David Bowie but like some of his underlings! But somehow in spite of the age difference, the love story moved me greatly. I wonder why? Perhaps in all our secretest heart, we want a prince charming and live in a fairytale ending ever ever after instead of living in the real world, with its taxes, retrenchment, economic problems. So yeah Sarah chose bravely, I think I'm not so brave and I would have chosen differently.",Labyrinth

I also must admit, that as I've grown older, I have found Jareth more and more sexy...but that's another story.Every shot is a visual treat, even the dullest of shots, when Sarah first enters the Labyrinth and we see close ups of her feet running down the (seemingly never ending) path, is beautiful to look at, the floor literally glistens and the sound design is perfect!

425,paramore-851-861678,Best Movie Ever!!!!,10,19 February 2014,"This is one of my favorite movies. David Bowie plays the Goblin King with Jennifer Connelly as his leading lady Sarah a young girl trying to get her brother back. She finds friends in the most unlikely characters and they all share a bond of defeating the King. In a place where nothing is as it seems she struggles through to the castle to defeat the Goblin King, get back her brother, and ultimately find herself. Jim Hansen creator of the Muppets, Fraggle Rock, and the Dark Crystal, has outdone himself with this one. Definitely a must see movie for the whole family. A classic soul searching main character, who meets with obstacles and must devise ways to overcome them with the help of their friends. To find out where her heart really lies, and to discover that she really does like how her life is. That family is important even when they make you do things that you really don't want to. That they love you for who you are even if they have a hard time showing it. Sometimes you have to find what really matters",Labyrinth

Tiny details are amazing. For example, the door from the oublient (opening opposite ways giving totally different exits!)Also just before Jareth gives Hoggle the poisoned peach, the camera angles show a glimpse of a rock which at one certain and easy to miss angle is a replica of David Bowie's face. such detail and humour has attracted me to this film since the age of 2!

Jennifer Connelly is very good as Sarah in this film.The Jim Henson puppets are amazing as always. You fall in love with the Hoggle and Ludo almost immediately!

I love the soundtrack (being a fan of David Bowie). The puppetry work is amazing; Jim Henderson gives life and character to the wide variety of puppet involved in the film.Begin a relevantly unknown; Jennifer Connelly gives an outstanding performance.

431,dustin-mixon83,An enjoyable film,5,18 June 2011,"At its core, Labyrinth is a story of a child entering adulthood. The story begins with Sarah Williams, played by Jennifer Connelly finds herself being forced to take care of her young brother, Toby, for the night while her parents have a date night. While in her care, Sarah grows irritated with her little brother and inadvertently conjures a goblin king, Jareth (played by David Bowie) into her realm where the goblin king takes Toby away and sets a challenge before young Sarah; navigate the labyrinth in 13 hours, or Toby will become a goblin for eternity. So sets the adventure that unfolds over the course of the film; Sarah's quest to save her brother from his horrible fate that she unintentionally created for him.Labyrinth is an interesting film. But, what else should be expected when you have a film conjured up by the combination of Jim Henson--best known for The Muppets--and George Lucas of Star Wars fame (or infamy depending on how one looks at it). The world itself is full of intensely interesting creatures and landscapes that show a flair for creativity and originality. This should be expected in this type of film. Logic is not meant to be followed and the rules can always be changing. That, in itself, is the advantage this film has; because the film is in an imaginary realm, it is not held to any set standard of logic. Instead, we are left with a world where one's imagination can run wild and be challenged.Character design and the world itself are fully developed from the mind of Jim Henson. Combining special and practical effects, we find only two real-world people interacting with creative an entire world of Muppet-style creatures, carrying the style that Jim Henson pioneered into this film in a much larger, grander scale. Elsewhere, the film boasts distinctive set pieces that are extremely different from one another, but still effectively tied together through a dark, demented core. The characters will traverse such varied locales as the Bog of Eternal Stench, a dark, twisted recreation of Sarah's bedroom, and a masquerade ball that is a demented, hallucinogenic trip are a very good idea of the set design seen in the film. Again, these set pieces really push the creative envelope as you can tell the creative team were unhindered when it came to being creative and thinking ""outside of the box"" during filming, again taking advantage of the lack of required logic in the film's design.Though the ending won't be spoiled during this review, it should be expected that the film wraps up with a happy ending for the family and children that the film is intended for. However, it's important to note that the film ends on a solid note that ties the overall theme together from that of its opening. As the film ends, we find Sarah sitting and reminiscing about her adventure, before finally realizing that, through the experience of rescuing Toby and returning to her realm, she has passed from being a child into a young adult.That it did poorly at the box-office (making only $12,729,917 back of its $25 million dollar budget) is not indicative of the film itself, nor should it be judged as such. Instead, the film should be enjoyed for what it is; a lighthearted romp through a creative, fun world that has a solid, entertaining story from beginning to end.",Labyrinth
432,kasc1996,Amazing movie,10,18 April 2014,"The first time I saw this movie was at my grandmother's house at four years old. Back then, everything about this movie scared me, whether it was the goblins, Jareth, or even that cute caterpillar at the beginning. I didn't understand what was happening but I knew that I didn't like it. Fast forward to about twelve, I kept thinking of a movie but I couldn't figure out what it was called. After a while of searching I finally find the movie that I was thinking of; The Labyrinth. As I watched it for the second time I remembered how fearful I was eight years ago. I couldn't believe how scared I was of a movie that was so fun. Since then I have watched it about ten more times raising it to the top of my favorite movie list.When people ask why I like the Labyrinth so much they need to prepare for a ten minute speech. The storyline is impeccable; a teenage girl's brother being taken by a goblin king leading her to go through a Labyrinth meeting different creatures and doing different tasks. Not only does this scream intense, but it also is made to be funny. There are twists and turns all throughout her adventure that keep you on your toes. Not only is the story great, but the cast was chosen perfectly. Jennifer Connelly perfectly portrays a seemingly innocent teenage girl being thrust into an unexpected world. David Bowie shows that he not only is an amazing singer but an actor as well. For me, if Jareth were to be played by anyone else, the movie would not be as great as I believe it to be. The effects were great for the time period, special effects have advanced since the 80's but I find it to be very well done for the things they had accessibility to. There are a few goofs in the movie such as continuity issues and equipment being shown on camera. They weren't able to access much of the technology that we have today to prevent these mistakes. Overall, the Labyrinth brings many different genres to the table such as mystery, action, and even a bit of romance. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys anything. It's a classic in my book and it needs to be more well-known than it is.",Labyrinth

It's all subtly, on the top you have a beautiful childrens movie full of fantasy, but on second levels there's meaning to it.. meaning of growing up..it leaves you wondering whether she dreamt it or not.Its a marvelous movie and I truly recommend it to everyone to watch. I liked how Jareth was played, and trust me I've watched this movie over and over again, I can repeat his lines, and Sarah's. It's seems to me the story is all about growth in one girl and the lessons learned in the labyrinth.

438,BluestarSorcerer,A movie that shines with genius (and glitter),10,26 August 2004,"This is unquestionably a highpoint in the long and illustrious history of muppets. The scenery is evocative, the characters are endearing and creative, the storyline exhibits a strong cohesion, and the dialogue scintillates with wit. The truly remarkable thing about the Labyrinth, beyond the simple fact that it looks as jaw-droppingly gorgeous as it does, is that no single scene in the entire movie is anything less than perfect.That bears repeating. No single scene in the entire movie is anything less than perfect.Every line is impeccably appropriate to the characters, the mood of the scene, and its place in the story. Every word is in precisely the right place, and not one of them could be improved upon without radically altering the film. Jareth is heartbreaking, Sarah is emotionally accessible, even Toby plays his part with sincerity and gusto, and the muppet characters that surround them were clearly each custom-made for their role, with ingenuity and flair. No character is extraneous, down to the briefest cameo appearances. Not a single second of this film anywhere can be considered superfluous. The level of mastery involved in the Labyrinth's design is simply breathtaking. Perhaps that's why the humor never gets old, an effect that's notoriously difficult to achieve in any medium. If comedy is rooted in novelty, the Labyrinth is simply ageless.This film missed being my absolute favorite, only on a pure technicality. Really, it's not the fault of the Labyrinth that I saw the Dark Crystal first. If you haven't seen either, you owe it to yourself to hit the rental store and try it. You may just find yourself buying it on DVD immediately afterwards.",Labyrinth

443,Chrissy_15_Cowen,This movie is so much more than an adventure,10,12 January 2005,"I absolutely adore this movie! It is so much more than a childhood adventure about a girl rescuing her baby brother. And thats not just because there's David Bowie in it, with his fantastic blonde mullet and skin-tight spandex getup. Its about Sarah's growing up as well, and is also a love story, in case you didn't notice. In her quest for her baby brother Sarah abandons all of her childhood fantasies and selfish needs in order to save Toby, and her adventure in the LAbrynth is kind of like her last fling with the old imaginary world she built around herself. At the end of the story she realizes that she needs to live in the real world and start to care more about the real people in her life. Also, there's the strange relationship she has with the Goblin King, Jared. She is too immature to realize that his feelings for her are deeper than his outward malevolence. When she challenges him and comes after Toby I think that he finds himself falling in love with her, but this love is never really addressed openly. In the movie the action comes before the actual plot line. I think the Goblin King was just pretty desperate, I mean, did you see any real ppl in his kingdom? Its not like he was going to date one of the puppets that Jim Henson made. She was more attractive to him when she proved herself to be a worthy adversary, and defied him. I really think they should have gotten together when she got a little older... oh well. I love the part where she eats the peach and she ends up in the ballroom with him. The set was a little cheesy but I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. It was so cute how he looked upset when she stopped dancing with him. I also absolutely loved when she ends up in the room with all the stairs and he's decked out in black leather and knee-high boots. The song he sings for her is so meaningful but she doesn't get it at all, i mean how stupid do you have to be to get that he likes you? She bothered me a lot a few times in this movie. Its so great when he keeps disappearing and reappearing behind her and below her. I think David really captured his character in that scene. I like the haunting quality of the melody and the words... I've turned the world around for you... and the end of it where she still didn't get it and he sounds so sad and desperate when he says : Life without you sunlight...live without your heartbeat...I...can't...live...without...you...""

But i'm only 14. The thing about this movie is that, yeah, there may be some flaws, but when you're only 3 or 4 when you first watch this movie you don't notice that. I think that's what made it so special for me. I've been watching it before I even laid eyes on sesame street and it's still my favorite movie because it holds a lot of memories with it. It's like it's engraved in my head - I've memorized every line. I still get a jumpy feeling in my stomach at the part when i was watching it as my dad gave me ice cream. Just little things like that. And after not watching for a few years and then suddenly seeing it again brought back a lot. I found myself remembering all of the words to every song David Bowie sang in it. Also, after just watching the Hulk, I thought that the actress looked so familiar and I had to look it up. Sure enough it was Jennifer Connely, the first time I saw her in another movie besides the Labrinth. I still don't think that the part she played in the Hulk fit her at all. A movie I would expect to see her in would be more like the Lemoney Snicket Series of Unfortunate Events, not a Spiderman type of comic remake. I was disappointed. But what i'm getting at here is that I have understood the deeper meaning of the Labrinth before I could have ever figured out what kind of bird Big Bird really is. I love the Labrinth and I don't know why older people just point out flaws like they know it all. Yes, i'm only 14, but my will is as strong as yours and my kingdom as great.

Also, if you search, there is a lot of us fans still around; you just have to know where to look. Hint: try online, google us if you must! If you liked this movie, I recommend seeing ""The Dark Crystal,"" ""Neverending Story,"" and Neverending Story 2.""

Even the wondrous and stupendous sweeping plot of LOTR:TROTK under Peter Jackson and the hilarity of The Wedding Singer, my second and third favourite films, cannot hold a candle to this mother of all fairy (firey??) tales.From the androgynous handsomeness of David Bowie as the Goblin King, to the innocence-to-womanhood tale of Sarah, the film is full of rich detail, marvellous plot, twists and turns, and the magic of the much-missed Jim Henson.I hope that when I have children, they also appreciate the complexities of ""Labyrinth"" at both the childhood and adult stages.Long may the Henson legacy reign under Jim's son Brian.",Labyrinth

The story is kept very simple and nonsensical. Most of the movie is just David Bowie behaving very strangely, looking at a baby and a girl walking around a labyrinth without any idea what she has to do. There is really nothing interesting to see in this movie. The story writers came up with no new elements. Most viewers will know all of the ideas presented in this movie from some other movie they have watched before. Woke up the next day and directly went to the toilet.

It's one of the craziest things I've seen in a movie, it totally took me by surprise the first time I noticed it. He shakes his fist too, I think. It's one of the funniest most unexpected scenes in the movie. Anyway, I don't know how far into the flick it is, so you'll have to watch it from the beginning to see it. Also this movie can be a little creepy for sensitive little kids. Hoggle is really ugly and some of the opening scenes are pretty scary if you're only little.

When I first watched it, I couldn't understand it because the people around me were making to much noise, but the first thing I did when they were gone was I went to Rogers Video and rented the movie. I watched it almost five times in one day it was so good. It's an adventure movie, with a bit of comedy and it's a little scary, but not really. I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and magic. It is amazing!! If you get it on DVD, watch the documentary. It's really neat. It's got some bloopers in it, it shows you how everything was made and you can learn some stuff from it. My friend told me that she didn't like the puppet things. She was talking about the goblins, but she was right and she didn't know it. The goblins really are puppets!

It is appropriate for all ages, and all my family and friends are sick of it because if they ask me what movie we should rent, I always say The Labyrinth! Duh!

Sarah(Connely) loves ""The Labyrinth"" book and finally, she realizes that the book is REAL. Frustrated with her parents and her baby brother this 16-year-old says 'the words'. Her brother gone in the next seconds she begs Jareth(Bowie) to let her have him back. He gives her some leniency, but not much, and gives her thirteen hours to find her brother in a gigantic labyrinth. She takes many of the things in the Labyrinth for granted, then realizes that things are not always what they seem in a place where you never know which way is right. She encounters many friends along the way, and she never forgets them. Many people think that since Jim Henson directed, it must be those goofy Muppets. Not true. This movie is greater then the Muppets. And in my opinion, greater then Star Wars. Children and adults alike will enjoy this film. I severely recommend it.

The plot is predictable, the protagonist doesn't develop in any way, and doesn't suffer even a token internal conflict, her sidekicks are rather bland, and the movie even lacks the humor normally found in this kind of works. Acting and special effects are adequate, the music is annoying at some moments, but generally passable, and a couple of times the things are really cute. However, that doesn't save the movie.

464,swan_g3,Spans generations,10,17 July 2005,"This movie has been a favorite of mine since I discovered it in my own adolescence in the late 90s, on Disney and later VHS and DVD. It was such a frequent feature in my home that my own mother was probably ready to wish me away to the goblins, just to stop the torture...a feeling I can now relate to as my own son has adored this movie practically since birth. To the tune of three repetitions a day at times. The timeless lesson of 'be careful what you wish for' is superbly taught here by Jim Henson and crew in the tale of Sarah (Jennifer Connely,) a bratty teen who wishes her baby brother away to the goblins, then has to accept the challenge of the Goblin King (David Bowie) to win him back. Along the way she makes new friends and learn that not only does the universe not revolve around her, but that life is not always fair. David Bowie's music is superb, from the amusing 'Dance Magic', to the whimsical, if slightly oddball 'Fire Gang' and the romantic 'World Falls Down' Each song adds a wonderful new piece of enjoyment to the movie as well as a new facet to the Goblin King and the world he rules.

Yes maybe the acting wasn't what it was today, maybe there weren't scenes like they could have done today. But it was a great movie! Just the basic plot line of a an angry teen who wants to follow her dream of being an actress and a writer like her mother, who then says something that she really didn't mean. Life's not fair! Is an often quote that escapes her mouth. But then like we all do at some point we realize that Life isn't fair. No matter how bad you want it to things just don't turn out the way you want them, so an angry teen turns into a grateful and somewhat of a nicer woman. She matures in the movie, and she realizes that Life isn't fair, she makes friends that will always be with her in some form or another.

467,amandafarnsworth,Labyrinth; 30 years of magic,10,29 August 2016,"The movie starts out with a really cool title sequence featuring the first ever completely CGI animal, a barn owl to the music of David Bowie (Underground from the Labyrinth soundtrack). Then we are taken to a fantastical land where a maiden in a dress runs up to face her adversary and announces that ""through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered I have fought my way to the castle beyond the Goblin City to take back the child you have stolen..."" she goes on to say the her ""...will is a strong as yours, and my kingdom is as great"" only to be interrupted by a flash of lightening and responding clash of thunder. Then in a strange turn of events she mumbles what she just say, while still facing her adversary, only to proclaim ""damn I can never remember that line!"" and pulls a red book titled The Labyrinth out of her sleeve to recall her next line. But it's too late the enchantment has been broken, we discover the maiden is an ordinary teenage girl, her adversary is her faithful dog companion, and the fantastical land is merely a local park. A bell tolls and the girl runs from the park with her dog Merlin through the rain down suburban streets before arriving home to the disappointment of her stepmother (who through the release of the Return to Labyrinth manga is named Irene but fans had previously dubbed her Karen). We discover the girl, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) was supposed to be home an hour ago to babysit her half-brother Toby (Toby Froud). Through this interaction and the discovery of her room we learn Sarah is a fifteen year old girl stuck between her fantasy filled childhood, and growing up into a young lady. (Don't do it it's a trap!)As the night progresses Sarah unwittingly summons the Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie) to come and take her baby brother. In order to right her wrong she must solve the Labyrinth and defeat the Goblin King in 13 hours or Toby will be (allegedly) turned into a Goblin. Sarah proves to be impatient and inept at solving the mysteries of the Labyrinth, however thanks to some friends she makes along the way she manages to solve the Labyrinth, defeat Jareth, and rescue Toby. Through all this Sarah finds a happy medium between her fantasies and growing up (Peter Pan is displeased with you Sarah!)I ""discovered"" this movie when I was a very young child (so young I don't remember a life without Labyrinth), my cousin Kasi loved the movie so most every time when all of The Cousins stayed at our Grandma's we would watch Labyrinth among others like, Magic Island, Princess Bride, Legend, and Ketchup Vampires to name a few.To see more reviews like this head over to https://nerdyowlbooks.blogspot.com/",Labyrinth

470,ronhitch,The title is false,1,8 October 2016,"This movie should have been named MAZE. It is not a Labyrinth. Look up the meaning of the word Labyrinthr!!!! And then Maze. A Labyrinth is a simple mediation walk to the center, no mystery, and then walk out!!! A labyrinth is an ancient symbol that relates to wholeness. It combines the imagery of the circle and the spiral into a meandering but purposeful path. The labyrinth represents a journey to our own center and back again out to the world. Labyrinths have long been used as meditation and prayer tools. It is an archetype with which we can have a direct experience. We can walk it. It is a metaphor for life's journey. It is a symbol that creates a sacred space and place and takes us out of our ego to ""That Which Is Within""Labyrinths and mazes have often been confused. A maze is like a puzzle to be solved. It has twists, turns, and blind alleys. It is a left brain task that requires logical, and sequential, analytical activity to find the correct path into the maze and out.A labyrinth has only one path. It is unicursal. The way in is the way out! There are no blind alleys. The path leads you on a circuitous path to the center and out again.With a broadened understanding of who we are.",Labyrinth

Seriously hilarious, though ... sometimes intentionally (yes, Henson was fairly brilliant), but mostly not. The music though ... no one actually thought this was acceptable when this movie came out, did they? I'm sure today's pop music will sound equally as ridiculous in twenty years, but dear lord this soundtrack is despicable (and Bowie did put together some very fine albums) ... and hilarious.

While the STORY itself is intriguing it's more than made up for by the worst performance of Jennifer Connelly's career, the horrible soundtrack, David Bowie, and the special effects. Fairy tales need to be told in a timeless classical way, not the incredibly dated, late 80s movie we have going on here. I only had to watch a few minutes of it to know it was made between 86-89 because the special effects were just so fake. The story is timeless; the movie itself is not.It's okay to appreciate a movie's writing or characters, but to ignore Jennifer Connelly's terrible, wooden performance is unacceptable. The soundtrack is not good, period. Even all the muppet singing scenes fall terribly flat. They're not funny, or amusing, or story progressing, and sometimes(the scene with the men tossing their heads around) actually hurts ones ears to listen to.

479,amberryn,Dance Magic Dance,10,10 December 2005,"Labyrinth is a classic because it's a crowd pleaser. It's a romance, adventure, drama, coming-of-age, musical fairy tale with a British accent. It has something to entertain, delight, or horrify everyone.The ballroom scene is so perfect in capturing what a child thought being a grown-up would be like and how different it is. And can you not smile at Sir Didymus "" The air is sweet and fragrant..."" and whether its the sometimes cheesy songs or Bowies package ( the original wardrobe malfunction) that make you cringe there's got to be at least a dozen other redeeming qualities to make it all seem just peachy. Jim Henson was the master of his art his puppets (some of my best childhood friends) steal the show (Bohemuth,Ludo,the helping hands and the fireies were brain bending effects for the time)Brian Froud's artistic concepts of the goblins and their weapons were fantastic and whimsical! and David Bowie made the best fitting soundtrack to a movie I've ever heard. ""Within You"" still gives me goosebumps and if you can resist foot tapping to ""Chilly Down"" then I do believe that ""your mother is a fragging aardvark!""The plot is simple as all good fairy tales should be young Sarah is on a quest to rescue her baby brother from the Goblin King who has kidnapped him and taken him to his castle beyond the goblin city (in the middle of a labyrinth) The magic of the movie is not in the plot but in the characters Sarah meets along the way. Each character is so well thought out and memorable even if their time in the movie is short you remember still the worm, the little critters under the tiles, the lichen(those had me inspecting the lichen in our yard a bit more closely)It's definitely a must see for all children and those poor sods who didn't get to see it as kids. When I was growing up it was my favorite movie I knew the words by heart within 2 weeks, my parents dreaded a trip to the video store because they knew it would mean renting it yet again and for some reason their daughter born and raised in Seattle sounded as if she had lived in Liverpool all her life after watching it. The scene with the crystal ball juggling caused some injuries and dents in the walls (dont try to duplicate with billiard balls) and many failed attempts to send my younger brother the the goblin king, guess Jareth didn't take a shine to me :( The movie has inspired me and reminded me that ""Things aren't always fair"" and for all those who say magic and fantasy are just for children and should be put away when it is time to grow up ""Damn I can never remember that line.""",Labyrinth

487,LorenArtemis,"A delightful blend of classic themes, memorable characters and engaging story lines",9,25 February 2006,"Labyrinth is a movie that can entertain a range of viewers from the young (and young at heart) through the classical literature professor. Oddly enough, but quite true. The surface story and characters are vibrant, providing a constant parade of situations, dialog and scenery that weave into a delightful adventure that take the viewer along for the ride. The underlying surprise is found in the steady stream of classical literary themes that form the bedrock of both the character motivational elements and many of the situations they find themselves experiencing. When I first viewed this movie shortly after it came out, I was delighted to bring a tape of it to my college literature professor and tell her with a knowing wink that ""this movie is a sneak attack of classical themes"". Her dubious look after looking at the tape sleeve was replaced the following class day with a delighted smile of her own. Both she and her grandson had found the movie to be a wonderful viewing experience. Labyrinth both entertains and educates with a deliciously subversive undercurrent of parable, myth and psychodrama.",Labyrinth

489,Chiyo-Chan,One fantastic fantasy,10,26 April 2006,"When I first saw this film I could only have been about five years of age. Something about this film captured my interest as a child and now as an adult I can see why.Most children like to imagine they can be whisked away to another world full of amazing creatures. In this film they get to follow Sarah as she is taken to the world of the Goblin King. Her task is to rescue her brother Toby before he too becomes a Goblin. Along the way she meets some colourful characters and learns a thing or two about herself. Watching her every move is the Goblin King who tries to make her give up her rescue attempt.The music is delightful and should have you singing along in no time. Most are sung by Bowie himself.Adventure, action, romance and a little humour makes this a must see for all fantasy fans and I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch a feel good film.",Labyrinth
