0,bkoganbing,Burned over Earth,5,16 June 2013,"I see that a lot of folks are happy with Tom Cruise's latest film which is his first venture into the science fiction genre since his remake of War Of The Worlds. I have to confess I'm a minority here since the story left me with more questions than when I started.As we learn from Tom's narration at the beginning he's a survivor from Earth after an alien invasion scorched the planet leaving unfit for human habitation. But we've managed by the time of the middle 20th century to reach Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn. That's where earth survivors have gone. The aliens also destroyed the moon which as we know has a great deal to do with our gravity as well as determining tides. The natural disasters resulting were just a prelude to the war that followed.Cruise is a repair technician who fixes the drones that patrol the burned over Earth. Like most from Titan his memory has been wiped of times before. But those things that Sigmund Freud talked about, where the Krels created monsters from in Forbidden Planet, dreams in forbidden places bring up memories now that the Earth is a forbidden planet.I watched Oblivion and quite frankly I thought the story and script were incoherent and the direction almost non-existent. I'm sure that the legion of fans Tom Cruise will go see it. That and all the scientologists in the world. I'm sure Tom saw some scientology doctrine in the story which must have been what attracted him to the film.",Oblivion
1,Leofwine_draca,"Looks good, but the story's not great",5,28 January 2016,"OBLIVION is a great-looking addition to the wave of serious science fiction movies that have been filling cinema screens of late. It has wonderful vistas of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and although the screen is often full of CGI effects, they're handled very well and the overall result is a beautiful-looking movie.A shame, then, that all of the money and the visuals are wasted a little on a storyline that turns out to be rather clichéd and predictable. OBLIVION takes a number of well known sci-fi tropes and mixes them all together in a somewhat unsatisfying mess; you know from the very outset the sort of thing that's going to happen here, and sure enough it does. It doesn't make for much in the way of entertainment, even if it is good spectacle.Tom Cruise stars in the usual everyman hero type role he's well known for, and he's not bad here; but none of the actors are required to do a great deal, which is a shame when there's genuine talent in the supporting cast. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets all of two lines, and Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko both look arresting but play rather one-dimensional characters. By the time you reach the second hour of this slow-moving production, all of what transpires will have been well telegraphed in advance, leaving this a somewhat hollow viewing experience.",Oblivion
2,SnoopyStyle,looks great but too many logic questions,6,19 August 2013,"It's 2077. The Earth has been devastated after winning a war against aliens. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairman living with Vika Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) on an isolated floating outpost. It's been five years since their mandatory memory wipe. Humanity has moved to Titan. The platform transforms water into fusion energy for the new home. Jack has to fight the reminent alien scavs. Despite the wipe, he has dreams of memories and collects relics from the past. He finds a crashed ship and revives Julia Rusakova (Olga Kurylenko) from status. They are captured by humans led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman).There is no denying that this movie looks great. I even like the wimpy sounds the machines make. Right from the start, things don't seem right. If this movie had any hope, the story must pass the smell test at the start. As Jack lays out the exposition, a dozen different questions come to my mind. The world doesn't make sense and it's annoying. Once the start doesn't make sense, then it's questionable why Jack can't see it. Even with a good reveal, not all the questions are answered. And the damage is done already anyways.",Oblivion
3,claudio_carvalho,"Invasion, Recollections and Truth",8,4 August 2013,"In 2077, the human Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works with his companion Victoria ""Vic"" (Andrea Riseborough) on the surveillance station Tech 49. Jack repairs drones and his memory was erased as part of the security process to stay on Earth, and he knows that Earth is completely depleted after sixty years of war against the alien invaders Scavengers ""Scavs"". The aliens have destroyed the moon and were defeated by nuclear weapons and the earthlings have moved to Jupiter's moon Titan since the planet was completely destroyed. Now Jack has to protect the power stations that use the ocean to supply energy to Titan fixing the drones. He also has recollections of a mysterious woman at the Empire State Building when Earth was habitable. Jack and Vic receive instructions from Sally (Melissa Leo), who is located on the space station Tet, and Vic is anxious to leave Earth in two weeks to join the survivors on Titan. However, Jack has a cabin in a secret place where he likes to stay alone. When the spacecraft Odyssey crashes on Earth, Jack witnesses the drones killing the human crew but he rescues a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko), who is the woman of his recollections. Julia and Jack recover the flight recorder but they are captured by the Scavengers. Soon they learn that the Scavs are actually a group of humans led by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) that tells to Jack that the invasion was a lie. Jack does not believe and Malcolm releases Julia and Jack and asks them to go to the radiation zone to find the truth.""Oblivion"" is a great sci-fi movie, with an engaging and entertaining story of alien invasion, recollections from the past and the truth. I am not fan of Tom Cruise, but he has a perfect performance in the role of a man that discovers the truth of the alien invasion. The plot is very well constructed, with intelligent plot points, one of them inspired in ""Lunar"", and the special effects complement the story as should be. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Oblivion""",Oblivion
4,nogodnomasters,THROW THE LONG BALL,8,7 May 2018,"In the year 2077 Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are a working couple who live in a tower on the planet earth. We are given the background: Aliens called Scavengers or ""Scavs"" destroyed the moon. The earth went into turmoil. We managed to defeat them through the use of nuclear weapons. With our planet uninhabitable, our people went to live on Titan. An orbiting triangle space station gives orders to Jack whose mission is to maintain an army of drones used to hunt the remnants of the scavengers.Jack's memory was erased in case aliens capture him. He has dreams of a woman (Olga Kurylenko)in NYC from a time long before the invasion. About the time Morgan Freeman shows up, things tie together, we get the twist, and the film takes off in a different direction.The characters in the film are dry. The dialouge was boring. The action moved slow with the film definitely being too long. I enjoyed the one early scene where Cruise attempts a ""Mission Impossible"" type of escape, one that fails. The cinematography was great with a decent story line. If you love science fiction and are tired of those SyFy films, this is a welcomed change with neat killer drones and landscapes.I am sure Cruise didn't have to beat himself up too much to accept the role of Luke Skywalker, Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith, Independence), and Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis, Armageddon) all wrapped into one as he saves the world from alien invaders. This film is an obvious Scientology film just like ""Battlefield Earth"". Tom Cruise believes, according to ""Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief"" that he will actually save the planet from alien invaders. Gotta love it.Parental Guide: One f-bombs (1 SOB) no sex, no real nudity. Brief sensuality. Brief Riseborough buttocks (?).",Oblivion
5,kosmasp,They cloned Tom Cruise?,6,20 August 2013,"That might be a question you'll ask yourself while watching this. It is incredible how you he looks in this one. Or maybe Scientology actually discovered some youth serum after all. Which brings us to the elephant in the room. I don't think you can necessarily see this as a Scientology project (which can't be said about After Earth, but that's an entirely different topic, discusses over there).The movie itself is simple and clear and it works. I was surprised at how decent they made it. And I don't mean the technical aspect, because that is just amazing. Though I imagine they did use a lot of money to make those effects work. Worth it of course. And maybe Cruise's face is an effect too. Whatever the case, there is action, there is sci-fi, drama and a love story. So you kinda get everything. Oh and mystery too!",Oblivion
6,lee_eisenberg,totally predictable,2,24 September 2013,"It's gotten to the point where all of Tom Cruise's movies are essentially the exact same story with a different setting. He always fights danger, barely avoiding getting killed. Usually it's an urban setting with car crashes, but ""Oblivion"" is set in an irradiated post-apocalyptic world with killer robots. Even if you're concerned about nuclear proliferation and figure that this movie might warn about the prospect of a nuclear holocaust, ""Oblivion"" comes across only as a movie produced with the aim of making a zillion dollars. This is one movie that deserves to get forgotten very quickly.""Mom, Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!"" - one of the boys on ""South Park""",Oblivion
7,jboothmillard,Oblivion,6,20 May 2013,"I saw plenty of interviews, clips and a trailer or two for this futuristic film, so I reckoned it had to be worth seeing if the hyping for it was worth it, from director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy). Basically it is the year 2077, planet Earth was nearly destroyed following an invasion of aliens known as Scavengers, or ""Scavs"", they destroyed the Moon causing worldwide tsunamis, earthquakes and various other natural disasters causing devastation. A war broke out between the aliens and remaining humanity, and nuclear weapons were used, meaning more destruction, but surviving humans were migrated to a colony called Titan, a large space station powered by sea water, and they currently remain there until Earth is habitable. The only ones who remain are above Earth in the clouds in Tower 49, there clone technicians Commander Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria 'Vic' Olsen (Brighton Rock's Andrea Riseborough) are working together, romantically as well, to secure and repair drones on the ground below that defend the power stations that generate fusion power from the seawater. As a clone Jack has flashes of a former memory, that was supposed to be erased for security reasons, where he met a woman on the Empire State Building in New York, and one day an unknown craft crashes to the ground, and investigating he and Vic find various pods with people in hyper-sleep pods, and one contains the woman from his memory flashes. Saving her from being killed by a drone misidentifying the pods as enemies this woman is awoken, she identifies herself as Julia Rusakova (Quantum of Solace's Olga Kurylenko) from the Odyssey, a NASA ship, but she refuses to reveal her mission, and then they end up captured by the Scavs, who are in fact humans living on Earth underground. Leader Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) explains that the war between aliens and humanity is in fact a lie by the Tet, the space station that orbits Earth and where mission controller Sally (Melissa Leo) gives the technicians their orders, he says that the Tet must be destroyed if the human race is stand a chance to survive and perhaps return to Earth. Jack initially refuses to believe this story and help the Scavs with this plan, but when he returns to Tower 49 he realises Vic has discovered his memories of being in love with Julia have returned, and announcing that she and him are no longer an ""effective team"", and this causes the drones are programmed to kill him and Julia. Jack accepts now the story about the war being a lie, and he is prepared to go ahead with the plan to enter the restricted area supposedly vaporised by radiation from the nuclear weapons, but it is in fact where the original version of Jack Harper remains and does exactly the same job as his clone self. Replacing himself as the Jack Harper in this world clone Jack is able to put together his plan to go against the Tet, and along the way he finds out he was also a pilot along with Julia on the Odyssey, and he travels to space claiming to be bringing mission control the prisoner they wanted. In space we see the thousands of humans floated in suspended animation, and back on Earth we see pilot Julia is in fact back on the planet, and the one in the pod Jack is taking is injured Beech with the nuclear device to destroy the Tet, but in the end three years pass and Julia with her child has an encounter with the memory of Jack which he reawakened, or something like that. Also starring Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Sykes and Zoë Bell as Kara. Cruise is a good choice as the security repairman haunted by memories of his real self, Kurylenko and Freeman do their parts well also, the story is a little complicated but clever mixing past, present and future, the special effects are fantastic, and the sequences of chases and technological destruction is fun to watch, it is a watchable post-apocalyptic science-fiction action adventure. Good!",Oblivion
8,rmax304823,The Ethics Are Situational.,6,10 July 2014,"This is one of those futuristic movies that always confuses me because memories have been manipulated, the past is a mystery, and just when the hero (Cruise) and the viewer think they have a handle on the plot it turns into one of those giant, lavender, plopping mud puddles at Yellowstone National Park. Where am I? The movie begins clearly enough. There has been a war that wiped out most of the people on Earth except those who have migrated to a colony elsewhere, one of Jupiter's moons or someplace. A few misguided enemy stragglers have been left behind on earth, hiding in holes, and must be eliminated -- casually, one by one -- by Tom Cruise.Cruise has nothing much to complain about. He lives in a spotless plastic penthouse on top of a promontory and although he doesn't seem to have an HD-TV with a wide, curving screen, or much of anything else in the way of cultural artifacts, no cooking utensils or anything, he's not exactly starved for company. He's in constant touch with home base by radio/TV. They give him occasional orders like, ""Scab found poking around at grid X plus 3. Eliminate."" Moreover, he has a house mate who handles all the communications and monitors Cruise's movements when he takes his helicopter out on a mission. She's skilled at her job. And, more important, compliant -- even eagerly compliant. And she's played by Zoë Bell, who is attractive, has these arresting Saurian eyes, and has done stunt work for people like Uma Thurman in real life. One can bet she brings new meaning to the concept of gymnastics.A nice, quiet, domestic life for Cruise -- and the work is pleasant, too, occasionally blowing up people or left-over robots. I kept waiting for ""Morning"" from Peer Gynt Suite. His own robots zip around in the air and look like angry pool balls. They do the wet work. But everything is not what it seems. Is it ever? When you look in the mirror, maybe you THINK you're seeing yourself as you really are, but you're not. The left hand side of the REAL YOU is the right hand side of the image in the mirror. I have broadened this idea into an entire philosophy of existence and expect to publish it shortly in my next volume: ""The Reflective Universe."" The logic is not entirely my own. It owes a great deal to the German phenomenologist and onanist Martin Freidegger, and to my high school football coach. (Thanks, Butch.)Where was I? Anyway, the whole idyllic life is just a fantasy. The underground enemy is led by Morgan Freeman in black leather armor and shades. He and his acolytes live in a cave, so it's very dark. Then Olga Kurylenko enters the film and it brightens considerably. What a stunning babe. I am so glad the Cold War is over so she can be an unalloyed good person. Not only is she ""good"" but she, too, is compliant, I suppose compelled by the sheer Tom Cruiseness of the hero. But that's okay because she's also very moral. Yes, despite the apparently illicit sexual congress. Because she's his wife -- That's about as far as medical ethics will allow me to go with the plot. Besides, by this time I was terribly confused and I don't know if I could describe it accurately. The climax is an extravaganza of special effects, and not bad, as these things go. Action aplenty. Those peed-off pool balls really get around and they're hard to knock down, even with what appears to be a quad mount of M-2 .50 caliber machine guns.It's interesting enough to hold your interest but I wish they'd stop messing around with dreams, memories, fantasies, brain transplants, and all that stuff. If anyone needs that kind of confusion they can always glance through ""Finnegans Wake"" or something.",Oblivion
9,Tweekums,Solid sci-fi where things aren't what they seem,8,1 October 2015,"As this film opens narrator/protagonist Jack Harper explains the situation to us; the film is set some time after a war during which the Earth was attacked by aliens dubbed 'Scavs'; these Scavs destroyed the moon which led to cataclysmic events on Earth and although the Scavs were defeated humanity was forced to relocate to Titan. In order to provide energy for those on Titan the Earth's oceans are used a fuel for giant fusion reactors. Jack is a technician who works, with colleague Victoria, to maintain the drones that protect the reactors from the few remaining Scavs. In order to protect the Earth's secrets they have both had their memories wiped before their five year mission.Despite this memory wipe Jack dreams of a woman who he has apparently not met before and has an interest in pre-war items he finds. Everything changes for Jack when a pre-war spacecraft returns to Earth; the drones eliminate all but one of the survivors the woman of Jack's dreams. He soon learns that nothing was quite what he believed; friends become enemies and enemies become friends as he must decide how to save humanity and the woman he loves.I didn't know much about this film before watching it; just the blurb on the DVD box and the fact that it starred Tom Cruise this is probably the best way to go into the film as there is an enjoyable sense of mystery as we wonder what Jack's dreams mean and start to question the 'facts' he has told us. There are hints that things aren't quite what they seem but nothing definite until the 'big revelation' half way through the film and even then not everything has been revealed. This gradual revealing of the truth kept me gripped. Tom Cruise does a fine job as Jack and he is ably supported be Andrea Riseborough as Victoria and Olga Kurylenko as the woman in his dreams. Morgan Freeman also puts in a solid performance but his part is much smaller than his second billing would lead one to expect. The special effects are great; I especially liked the aircraft Jack uses and the tower he and Victoria are based in one could almost believe they were real. While this isn't really an action film there are moments of impressive action including a fight between Jack and another technician who looks remarkably familiar. Overall I found this to be a really enjoyable film that fans of sci-fi and Tom Cruise are likely to enjoy.",Oblivion

11,BA_Harrison,I'll file this next to Interstellar: in the 'Unlikely to be watched again' category.,5,4 May 2015,"2017: hostile aliens known as Scavengers wage war on the human race, blowing up the moon, causing catastrophic natural disasters on Earth. Sixty years later, and most of the surviving human population have left to start a new life on Titan (a moon of Saturn); only Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain, their job to track and repair the drones designed to protect the massive power plants that supply energy to the Earth crafts, the pair receiving their orders from Sally, who is located on an orbiting space-station called the Tet. But when Jack rescues a woman named Julia from the wreckage of a downed NASA spacecraft, he kickstarts a chain of events that will lead him to a shocking revelationThere's no denying that Oblivion is a visually impressive movie, with the post-cataclysmic scenery on Earth being particularly breath-taking, but the script and the direction leave a lot to be desired. The story is intentionally perplexing for most of the run-time, drip-feeding just enough information to keep the viewer intrigued to the finish, where loose ends finally pull together—but when all is said and done, there are simply too many contrivances, plot-holes, and unanswered questions to make it all work (Case in point: Why do the Scavs hide the fact that they are human? Why, to further the plot of course! Case in point, number two: isn't it convenient that that only survivor of the Odyssey happens to be Jack's wife?).If all of this nonsense had been flawlessly handled by director Joseph Kosinski then I might have been a little more forgiving about the iffy (and rather derivative) plot, but somehow he makes a big-budget film about Earth's fight for survival against a hostile extraterrestrial intelligence seem incredibly boring: for much of the time, it's just Cruise wandering the barren planet, fixing his machines or taking a break listening to records at his lakeside cabin, which soon gets tiresome—but even when the action scenes do kick in, the film is strangely devoid of excitement or tension. 124 minutes seemed a lot longer.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for the lovely Riseborough, who helped the time pass a little easier whenever she was on screen.",Oblivion
12,paul_haakonsen,"Not as bad as it could have been, nor as good...",6,6 August 2013,"Having heard both good and bad things about this movie, it was with some conflict of heart that I sat down to watch the movie. I had no idea what to expect from the movie, as people I had talked to about it were divided into very different camps regarding the movie.Personally, well I enjoyed the movie, although I will not go as far as to say that it was a brilliant piece of masterwork. And there are some better and more impressive Sci-Fi movies available. ""Oblivion"" starts out alright and gets into a good pace rather quickly, but then it settles in that pace and never really goes beyond that. Which was a shame, because that sort of held the movie back in a monotone sort of way. And also, the movie suffered somewhat of a setback once you get past the point where they pass into the radiation zone. Without saying what happens there, I can imagine that it is the point in the movie that divides people into the ""like it"" and ""don't like it"" camps.Storywise, then ""Oblivion"" wasn't spectacular, but it was alright. There were some good moments here and there, and some good enough action scenes as well. However, what was lacking was more dialogue and more character interaction with one another. It had somewhat of a superficial glance to it. It never really challenges the audience into thinking or lead to any kind of brain activity; this is basically just switch into auto-gear, sit back and enjoy the ride.For a movie with an approximate budget of $120.000.000, then the end result is not really all that it could have been. And the ending to the movie, well it was just a downright typical predictable Hollywood ending.""Oblivion"" has its flaws, but it also has its qualities. And it does provide good enough entertainment, although it had a tendency to drag on a little bit more than necessary. It is a beautiful movie to look at, but beneath the glamour and CGI, there was little meat on the bone, so to speak.",Oblivion
13,Quinoa1984,I dunno,6,11 November 2014,"Maybe I've seen too many science fiction movies.What this movie cribs, which is putting it generously... WALL-E (top of the list), 2001, Planet of the Apes, Logan's Run, The Island (I think, though maybe that cribbed Logan's Run too), Solaris, Blade Runner (WITH THE AWFUL NARRATION), and Um... lots of other stuff I'm sure I thought of watching it.Derivative is the name of the game, ladies and gentlemen, but lord knows the production designers, special effects teams (no joke, it is gorgeous to look at... until it's same ol' stuff), and Tom Cruise - all of them, and that includes Andrea Risborough - are trying. But really, this is the sort of film that gives 'homage' a bad name.Indeed I would posit that any of the negative criticisms directed at Tarantino the past several years, about being too much into homage and reference (or his whole career depending on POV) should be directed here instead. Despite all of the strengths cosmetically speaking, the story posturing for something deeper, it doesn't feel ashamed to borrow from the best (it might've been better had it outright stolen it, it tries to be its own thing but it always has the air of influence but without its own heart).",Oblivion

Jacks lives in an airborne tower floating thousands of feet above the Earth which he and his colleague are part of the operation to clean up the remaining forces of the invasion and extract the planet's remaining resources. Nearing the end of his mission, Jack rescues a female stranger from a crashed spaceship. Following her arrival, he is captured by an insurgency led by the mysterious Malcolm Beech and following a series of events he is forced to question everything he knows about the invasion and its aftermath. Inside the insurgent camp, it is demanded that he repair a recently captured drone to not fire on them. His colleague back at the tower then sends a drone to scout the area for Jack, but it is soon disarmed by members of the resistance. Jack successfully manages to plea for his release, being that more Drones would be sent for him if he were to stay. He manages to return with the female stranger, who is actually revealed to be his long lost wife, Julia. The ship he found her in was actually a NASA shuttle that had been orbiting around Earth for 60 years. This also shows that Jack is actually one of the many clones taken from the actual Jack Harper, that helps repair drones and scout for alien presence.With a reality that is shattered as he discovers shocking truths that connect him to Earth of the past, Jack will be pushed to a heroism he didn't know he contained within. The fate of humanity now rests solely in the hands of a man who believed our world was soon to be lost foreverOblivion is a visual feast with strong performances and an intriguing central mystery, but it's slightly let down by a nakedly derivative script and a general lack of warmth.The script's philosophical musings about humanity and self-sacrifice are almost as flimsy as the central love triangle that fails to ignite the emotional afterburners for a slam-bang finale.It's a shame the lack of originality becomes a distraction forty minutes in and the spectacle isn't enough to stem the overriding sense of déjà vu that does its best to dazzle by its myriad of special effects but confuses itself.Overall,it tries hard to resurrect the spirit of '60s and '70s sci-fi may impress with its scale.It can be enjoyed by a Tom Cruise fan and someone who loves these types of movie but it is far from being a masterpiece and an unforgettable film.",Oblivion

Instead, ""Oblivion"" resembles Steven Spielberg's abysmal adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic ""War of the Worlds"" with its global destruction drama where Cruise struggles to protect his daughter.Comparatively, ""Oblivion"" occurs primarily on Earth, but the action unfolds in the year 2077 long after planet Earth has been devastated by both aliens and Mother Nature. Cruise is suitably cast as a handy man in a uniform who flies around in a dragon-fly helicopter and repairs drones on the planet surface. Although he has five decades of stardom under his belt, Cruise hasn't let it go to his waistline. In other words, he isn't ashamed to show off his lean, muscular physique. Unfortunately, he plays a rather dreary, straightforward schmuck who, through no fault of his own, could be anything but dreary. When he isn't fixing space gadgets, Cruise falls back into action hero mode with a look of grim determination to vanquish evil. Meanwhile, two women wage their own war over him. Sure, even in the future, some things never really change. This enigmatic, earth-bound, sci-fi epic looks sensational. Oscar winning ""Life of Pi"" lenser Claudio Miranda's lush cinematography and Darren Gilford's sleek production designs are a treat for the eye. Sadly, stunning, sunlit scenery and scintillating photography cannot compensate for a plodding narrative. Sophomore director Joseph Kosinski of ""Tron: Legacy"" and ""Trepass"" scenarist Karl Gajdusek with ""Toy Story 3"" scribe Michael Arndt serve up predictable pabulum, with humdrum characters, and surprises that only sci-fi fans will anticipate without relish. I cannot really divulge much about the plot without spoiling it.The premise of ""Oblivion"" is difficult to accept without hoisting your eyebrows. Most of planet Earth sprawls in ruins after the mother of all wars. Aliens identified only as 'Scavengers' have blasted away half of the Moon. Afterward, Mother Nature raised Hell itself with every cataclysm you can imagine. What Mother Nature and the aliens didn't bring to this apocalyptic smackdown, Earth provided in the form of nuclear weapons. We're informed that Earth repulsed the extraterrestrials, but the devastation has prompted mankind to pack up for Saturn's largest moon Titan. Meantime, Earth's survivors have masterminded an enormous tetrahedral space station known simply as the Tet. Imagine the Death Star from the ""Star Wars"" franchise orbiting Earth. This Tet can launch dozens of spherical drones that resemble the ball turret gunners on vintage B-17 Flying Fortresses from World War II. Jack keeps these heavily-armed, drones airborne and the drones fly sorties to safeguard mega-gigantic hydro rigs sucking water out of Earth's ocean. These rigs are extracting the last useful minerals that will be shipped off to Titan. However, there is one catch. The Scavengers haven't entirely surrendered, and these guerrilla factions menace Jack and company. Nevertheless, Jack and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) live together in blissful ignorance on a towering house far above Earth's surface and conduct their assigned routines.One day Jack watches as a spacecraft re-enters Earth's atmosphere and crashes nearby. He manages to get to the crash site and save one of the life pods that contains Julia (Olga Kurylenko of ""Centurion"") before the drones wipe the rest out. All along, our hero has been having some wild dreams inhabited by a woman who resembles Julia. Equally distressing for Jack is that the lady of his dreams lived over sixty years ago well before he was born. Imagine his surprise when she tells him that she is his wife. Things get even weirder when Jack stumbles onto an army of beastly looking customers led by a cigar-chomping Morgan Freeman. This is about as far as I can go without blowing the lids on several significant plot points.""Oblivion"" doesn't qualify as the kind of sci-fi movie you'll remember a week after you've seen it. The aliens versus earthlings tale doesn't provide the kind of cool looking action featured in either ""Star Wars"" or ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars."" Cruise's military outfit and his arsenal of weapons look bland. The clever looking dragon-fly helicopter performs some nimble stunts, but it is a far cry from the chopper in ""Blue Thunder."" The plot and its surprises are something that you'd expect from the SyFy Channel. Only a handful of characters populate this two-hour plus spectacle, and none of them spout any memorable dialogue or strike an interesting pose. At one point, Cruise's Jack straddles a motorcycle and rides through desolate oceans that have become colossal sandlots with nuclear subs and aircraft carriers littering the terrain. The mission that Jack embarks on eventually is straight out of the first ""Star Wars"" movie as is an aerial dogfight between Jack and the drones along a twisting corridor of rocks. When you finally learn what is really going on in ""Oblivion,"" you'll know why it lives up to its name. Director Joseph Kosinski really botched this adventure. Not only does he wimp out with his characters, but also he stages some of the tamest confrontations in many moons. Incidentally, after you watch or avoid ""Oblivion,"" you should watch another sci-fi movie with similar themes entitled ""Moon"" with Sam Rockwell. Altogether, ""Oblivion"" qualifies as respectable but second-rate fare.",Oblivion

The plot seems to take twists for twists sake, not much is explained, and nothing much follows from before.

Tom Cruise does his usual action-hero stuff. Does it well, but it's nothing new. Olga Kurylenko is stunningly beautiful, as always, and puts in a decent performance. Morgan Freeman seemed to be on autopilot (I guess he sensed from the start this movie was hardly going to demand much of his considerable acting talents). Disappointing.",Oblivion

21,view_and_review,Alien Invasion With Twists and Turns,7,25 June 2014,"Oblivion is another alien movie but it has some interesting twists to it. Earth has been attacked by aliens, most of mankind has been wiped out and their only survival lies in escaping Earth. Or is it?I could give a longer synopsis but what you want to know is if the movie is good or bad. I think the movie was very good. By pure coincidence (or not) it was released around the same time as After Earth with Will and Jaden Smith, which seems to have a similar story. I never saw that movie to give it as a comparison but like I said, this movie is cool.The acting is solid enough as is the CGI and the action, but the quality lies in the story and the directing. For being only his second major film, Joseph Kosinski did a terrific job. He made sure not to make the plot to obvious and dull while giving the audience just enough. Some hidden facts may be easy to figure out but I don't think it ruins the movie at all. In fact, I'd say that the director may have thinly veiled certain things just to keep your attention on it.There is a good dose of excitement and thrills. There are some tense moments and narrow escapes, but ultimately this movie relies on the story and it did deliver.",Oblivion
22,Uriah43,An Effective Team,7,5 May 2014,"In 2077, the earth has been ravaged by an alien race known as the ""Scavs"" which has resulted in the remaining few human survivors having to relocate to the Saturn moon of Titan. To reach Titan the survivors have to get to a space station which eventually transports them. Needing fuel to stay operational, the space station has hired two technicians by the names of ""Jack Harper"" (Tom Cruise) and ""Victoria Olsen"" (Andrea Risebourough) to remain above Earth to maintain the fusion generators on earth and keep them safe from attack by the Scavs. Victoria operates as the communication specialist and relays orders from the space station to Jack who then flies to the surface and repairs the drones whenever they are damaged by the Scavs. Now, while Victoria and Jack manage to operate as an ""effective team"" there is one slight problem with their situation. However, rather than disclose what it is and possibly ruin the film for those who haven't seen it I will just leave it at that. One thing I liked about this film was that for an action movie it still managed to contain a very intricate plot with some big surprises along the way. I also liked the performance of Tom Cruise who continues to shine in one good movie after another. This one is certainly one of those and I rate it as above average.",Oblivion
23,ferguson-6,Another Day in Paradise,6,27 April 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Here we have Exhibit Number One in proving the theory that no quantity or quality of movie special effects can overcome the lack a good story. Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) directs his own graphic novel, and the result is a beautiful and impressive looking film that lacks any substance and fails to develop any characters for us to care about.This almost plays as a sci-fi tribute with tips of the cap to at least the following: The Matrix, Moon, Total Recall, Inception, Planet of the Apes, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 2001: A Space Odyssey ... and even Top Gun! Unfortunately, it falls short of all of those except for the stunning visual effects of the patrol drones (George Lucas would be proud) and the beautiful photography of Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi).The most obvious comparison is with Wall-E. This time, Tom Cruise plays the ""mop-up crew"" along with his assigned spouse played by Andrea Riseborough (very good as Wallis Simpson in W.E., and recently seen in Disconnect). We learn from the initial voice-over (by Cruise, not Morgan Freeman) that Earth was left in ruins after a long battle with aliens. Now the last bit of Earth's resources are being harvested before it is deserted forever.The cast is pretty deep with an extremely upbeat Melissa Leo showing up in the ""Hal"" role on a low-res video screen, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as leaders of the underground surviving humans, Olga Kurylenko (a Bond girl in Quantum of Solace, and currently in To The Wonder), and even stunt-woman extraordinare Zoe Bell making an appearance.All the wonderful toys are present, the look and feel are really something to see, the Jetsons-style home is kinda cool, and we get the ever-present Cruise sprint ... this time in a space suit!

Tom Cruise plays a drone repairman who brings any remaining resources back to the station. His partner is Andrea Riseborough and together they take orders from an image on a computer screen. Olga Kurylenka plays into it when she and her crew are discovered in their sleep quarters, which landed on earth. These quarters are destroyed by drones but Cruise saves her and seems to recall her from his past. It turns out that she is his wife. These leads Cruise to question everything including any possibility of an alien attack when Morgan Freeman enters the picture. He and a group of soldiers are hidden on earth and capture Cruise until understanding is met and questions presented. Director Joseph Kosiniski presents an entertaining screenplay that is joined by superb visuals. Cruise holds strong as someone questioning everything while conjuring memories that he struggles to piece together. Kurylenka and Riseborough are well cast as females who occupy opposite ends of Cruise's past. Only Freeman's role seems underwritten and more or less typecast. Also Melissa Leo is limited to more or less playing a computer as a contact. Entertaining yet totally made up of pieces of other films including Wall-E, Minority Report, Blade Runner, and ultimately Hal the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Oblivion

Her arrival triggers events that force him to question everything he knows and puts the fate of humanity in his hands.....After the average ness of both Tron: Legacy and Jack Reacher, my hopes were not very high for this movie. The trailers looked okay, but a film consisting of Cruise finding himself in a world that looks like an expensive Apple commercial didn't really float my boat.Anyhow, I love Science Fiction, and the comparisons to Moon and almost every single Science Fiction movie of the last five years compelled me to take a chance.The first half of the film is wonderful, the relationship between Cruise and Risborough is fantastic, and she really makes the film worth watching. This half of the film is the heart to Oblivion, and I could have happily had this for the rest of the film, but it goes another direction.It goes all Pitch Black for some reason and multiple Tom Cruises and Morgan Freeman turn what could have been some psychedelic Logan's Run type movie into another excuse for Cruise to flex his action muscles.Otherwise, its great to look at, Cruise does finish with a killer line, and its not too long.

Jacks orders and perceptions are questioned? Oblivion's themes of what reality is, and our perceptions of truth and that the truth can be manipulated by the information we receive work well with Oblivion's script.

27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Oblivion,10,11 April 2013,"Written by Joseph Kosinski, KArl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt, and directed by the Kasinski, who was also responsible for bringing a new spin to the Tron legacy, Kasinski traded the dark settings of that film for the light and bright, minimalist and futuristic look at Earth some 60 years after 2017, where unknown alien forces had taken out Earth's moon, and plunging the planet into chaos with its unpredictable forces of mother nature ravaging it, followed by an invasion that took out most of the human population. The war was won, but at the expense of the planet since the nuclear fallout made it uninhabitable. So the survivors made that interplanetary migration to Saturn's moon Titan, leaving behind a skeletal crew of two - Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) - some drones, and a forward base controller (Melissa Leo) to harness energy from the oceans. And of course to mop up what's left of the alien race still down on earth.However, that's what we're lulled to believe, as we follow the typical day of Jack and Victoria, who wake up, get to work, with Jack essentially being a human Wall.E, repairing broken down drones, and patrolling their assigned territory from the skies. Jack and Victoria enjoy life as per any typical couple with not much for recreation at night, but there's something niggling in Jack's mind, being haunted by memories of a strange, beautiful female (Olga Kurylenko), something that shouldn't happen given their mind wipe, and whose unannounced, surprising presence threatens to upset their entire couple harmony, and their effectiveness as a team. Three's a crowd and making things worse is when jealousy enters the picture.To say any more would be to ruin the many surprises in store, which lead to the many revelations that when pieced together will make perfect sense, since the writers kept the cards close to their chests, revealing crucial plot points at intervals, which is frustrating yet satisfying, and well worth the wait, although sometimes at the expense of pace, or editing continuity that wasn't as smooth as it would have liked to be. But no matter. Granted that the expositions won't be anything new, with genre clichés abound that the fans amongst us would be able to predict, but it's how these elements come together so perfect that makes Oblivion such a worthwhile watch. Yes there are the sleekly designed vehicles befitting a sci-fi flick here, with the necessary attention to detail and explanation to make everything seem plausible for this apocalyptic vision of the future.But I love the emotional core that anchored the film a hell lot more, so much so that I dare say not a lot of films, and a science fiction one at that, managed to move. It deals with the longing of a normal life, which Jack had desired as he slips off the radar now and then to build that illusion of an idyllic life in a pocket of paradise he found, with reason of course to come later in the narrative. And the love triangle was well played out, where its beginnings couldn't come any simpler than a brush, a touch and a photograph, all very fleeting, to sucker punch it through to your heart. And just how all these humanity blends so well with the CG- ed technology on display, that made it unbelievably solid.Tom Cruise is a very different animal here altogether, without his usual toothy grin, and being a lot more serious, sombre and contemplative with his character, that worked wonders. No doubt the obvious hero in the film, many elements of heroism got played down to make it a simple fight for the survival of a loved one, without grandeur plans of needing to save the day at the forefront. Olga Kurylenko may be the flower vase here, but what an effective one playing opposite Cruise for the first time, with her sheer presence making it believable the extent a man would go out for her. Andrea Riseborough, being the relative rookie amongst the three, also stood her own, playing what would be a tragic character seeing her blissful future snatched from under her feet. Her subtleness in her final scene in the film, spoke volumes of her ability to say so much with so little.A couple of scenes that stood out for me, such as the black and white flashback scene involving Jack and Julia (Kurylenko) when they meet before going up the Empire State Building, communications between Victoria and Jack when their perfect teaming started to give way, together with just above every revelation that had Jack flabbergasted, and those sweeping cinematography of landscapes of a broken Earth. And what provided this film that extra dimension, is the excellent and hauntingly beautiful score by M83 that lifts this film into another emotional stratosphere altogether, that without which, the movie isn't likely going to be as memorable, or emotional, as it got made out to be.Watch Oblivion on the IMAX screen no less, for those awesome visuals to envelope right up to the peripherals of your vision, and for that crystal clear pounding of the soundscapes and soundtrack right into your aural senses. This is the modern day treatment of The Wachowski's The Matrix in a certain way without the philosophical babble, but my, I'd give it five stars and a perfect ten! A definite recommendation, and a firm entry into my shortlist as one of the best films this year so far!",Oblivion
28,Mr-Fusion,"When the bullets aren't flying, it's pretty engaging sci-fi",7,10 February 2015,"The best of what ""Oblivion"" has to offer is its unique look. It features a distinctive style and design from the weapons, air/spacecraft to the architecture (man, that house in the sky is something) that makes this Apple store future inviting.

Surprisingly, this is where it started to lose me. Even so, the answers provided in the third act are a nice payoff. Iit ends on a poignant, hopeful note. For a Tom Cruise sci-fi, it's a solid movie - not as satisfying as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or ""Minority Report"", but still pretty good.

29,SimonJack,Fair futuristic space sci-fi shows strains of tedium,6,10 November 2020,"""Oblivion"" is a futuristic space sci-fi film - the type that is best enjoyed on the big screen. I especially enjoy such sci-fi, and first saw this film in a theater when it came out. I had enjoyed it then and just finished watching it again on DVD. I revised my rating down a couple notches on second viewing, but not because it seemed less spectacular on the smaller screen. If anything, my impression and enjoyment have probably been most affected by the plethora of films of the genre. It continues to expand, and with that its sense of unreality and the almost complete use of CGI.Imagine, with such a small cast, this film cost $120 million to make. Even with Tom Cruise getting paid more than $10 million for each film, and Morgan Freeman commanding high pay, that's a huge amount of money that went into some models for sets, art work and CGI.As with a few other sci-fi films in the 21st century, this one has a psychological plot that slowly unfolds. This is a good plot in that regard, but not a great screenplay or edge-of-the-seat film. The challenge for this genre, with the huge use of CGI in the future, is to come up with very different plots that will be interesting. The younger generation will continue to watch this type of films for a time, but over time, they will have their fill of films that become run of the mill.The sci-fi space genre is similar to another genre of films that had all but disappeared by the end of the 20th century. Western films used to be common from the 1930s into the early 1970s. There weren't many that rated in the top films for awards - a similar situation for sci-fi, but audiences, young and old, enjoyed Westerns. And over time, films of that genre became ho-hum. With the exception of an occasional extra budget film with a great story - or retelling of a Western legend, and with a big name cast and production, Westerns no longer appeal to the vast population. So, two decades into the 21st century, any fan base for Western films is miniscule.Consider these changing numbers that reflect the appeal and audience interest in Western films. In 1950, 123 Western films were made, and in 1940 there were 86. In the 25 years from 1930 to 1954, about 2,700 Western movies were made. That's an average of 108 per year. In 1970, 71 Westerns were made, mostly in North America and Europe. In 1971, 47 Westerns were made; and in the last three years of the decade, the numbers had dropped to 12, 15 and 16, respectively.Sci-fi films of the main space category face the same fate, it seems. With little variation, they are beginning to look like the same stories rehashed. Although they have had a longer run - from the earliest Buck Rogers space films of the 1930s to the present day, there are few films with new, imaginative or interesting plots. The psychological sci-fi films have held sway in the 21st century so far, but only so many of those can be made before they become tedious. The best of the space sci-fi films that still have drawing power are the Star Trek and Star Wars films that appear every few years. But that hardly represents an ongoing genre of appeal. Those films are unique by their diversity in characters, the human elements, with interesting stories and creatures. The special effects and CGI don't dominate.If anyone doubts that outer space sci-fi films are losing steam, just look at the box office for this big production. It lost money in the U.S. market, with only $89 million in ticket sales. It took worldwide sales to reach $286 million cumulative box office for it to cover its costs and make a small profit (studios earn about 50% of the box office sales).",Oblivion
30,siderite,"Big budget for a simple plot, but effective",8,18 April 2013,"There are a lot of good things going for this film: the special effects are flawless, the actors play well, the production values are high. Even the script is not the usual mess that US films have made us be used to. If there is a problem with Oblivion, it is that it is a too good a movie for its own story.OK, there is a twist, somewhere, but you need to not watch the trailer and be rather unconcerned to not see it miles ahead. There are action scenes, but not that many, so you can't go calling it an action film that doesn't need a story. Nor is the story badly written. It just feels so like one of the episodes of Outer Limits that it makes one uneasy while watching. Like something is missing, but you can't place your finger on it. And while it works on delivering the predictable finale, it starts losing its consistency and gaining logic holes that are the hallmark of careful work that was rushed at the end.In a way, it's a very expensive play. If you ignore the extras and the few scenes in which Jamie Lannister still has a hand, there are five actors in total. Some might multiply this with 50 or even 1000, but the actual actors are just five :) So my conclusion is that it was an entertaining film, with full control over the vertical and the horizontal, but less over depth of story. It reached a sort of uncanny valley for which production values are so disproportionately high compared to the complexity of the story that is made me uneasy.",Oblivion

32,MovieAddict2016,"Somewhat clunky story, but Cruise is dependably solid, and the special effects are great.",6,21 July 2013,"""Oblivion"" launches headfirst into its seemingly complex story, and to be completely honest, I found myself struggling to keep up with the plot at first. I won't rehash it here, because other reviews will do a better job, but essentially this is an old-fashioned, '70s-styled sci-fi flick with Tom Cruise playing a drone repairmen on Earth, which has become a post-apocalyptic wasteland by 2077.The reason I say the story is seemingly complex, is that I think the director, Joseph Koskinski, who also wrote the unpublished graphic novel the film is based upon, tries to over-compensate somewhat for the fact that the story is rather derivative of other titles. While his future world can be distinct at times, it's also reminiscent of other popular science fiction fare, whether it's the obvious like ""Star Wars"" and ""2001"" to the less-renowned, like the underrated ""Moon"" starring Sam Rockwell (one of my favourite science fiction films of the last decade, I think).Cruise gets better with age, and even though his films are rarely masterpieces or acting showcases, he has a knack for choosing reliably entertaining spectacles. He carries this movie as well as you might expect him to, and though the posters showcase Morgan Freeman for added box office potential, it's really Cruise's movie, and he nails it.Kosinski, after his debut ""Tron: Legacy,"" is still struggling with the narrative side of filmmaking, but his visuals are superb. I hesitate to refer to Oblivion as a ""low budget"" movie, but it is relatively so: in a year where $130 million buys you crappy-looking flicks like ""R.I.P.D.,"" it's pretty impressive that Kosinski has made the best-looking special effects experience of the year with a budget almost half of ""Iron Man 3"" or ""Man of Steel"" (both of which were less impressive effects-wise, and less distinct in their tone).The movie isn't great, it can be a bit confusing at times due to its messy storytelling, but it's worth it for Cruise and the special effects alone. And while it may not do as good a job as ""Moon"" at raising its existentialist questions, it's still a tad more thought-provoking than most big budget blockbusters.The score by M83 is also pretty great, and one of the highlights of the picture.I recommend Oblivion based on the merits of its star and visuals, as an overall Motion Picture Experience, but hope Kosinski places a bit more emphasis on the storytelling in his future films.",Oblivion

The atmosphere, surroundings and design is really cool despite Jack's(Tom Cruise) costume looking very similar to the one Aki Ross wore in ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"". And when it comes to Tom Cruise he is exceptionally good in this and brings out the right amount of emotion and facial expressions. He is a great actor despite the publicity he has been getting. In fact in some areas I think he is better than DiCaprio. Morgan Freeman also makes some appearances and like always he is a great side character and his presence in this is charismatic while also having some wisdom behind it. The story is memorable with a good build up, right amount of action sequences and gives almost the right amount of information on what is going on. And leaves the rest up to the audiences imagination while not insulting the audiences intelligence. Even if some parts of this film didn't make all that much sense, it's still passable and didn't get all that irritating.

Kosinski co-wrote the screenplay, with Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt (of 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE', 'TOY STORY 3', 'THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE' and 'STAR WARS: EPISODE VII' fame), and adapted it from his own unpublished graphic novel, of the same name. It's about a future where the world has been attacked by aliens and due to the destruction of the moon, as a result of the war, Earth's surviving human population moves to a space station called Tet and establishes a colony on Titan. Cruise plays a technician stationed on Earth in order to repair drones and protect machinery which is used to gather up the planet's remaining resources. The film is a great throwback to the sci-fi flicks of the 70s and it's visually striking enough, as well as emotionally intriguing, to make it worth while for any sci-fi nerd.Cruise plays Jack Harper, a technician/pilot finishing out the last couple weeks of his assignment on Earth; repairing droids to secure the use of other machinery there (used in gathering resources for the remaining human population). Once finished he can return home to live on Titan. His lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), is a communications officer stationed on the planet with him. The two report to their commanding officer on Tet, Sally (Melissa Leo), and also must worry about the remaining alien hostiles on the planet , called Scavengers (which the drones are used to wipe out). Jack and Victoria live in a tower miles above the ground and have no memory of the past (as their memory was erased in order to protect it from interrogation by the Scavengers). Despite the memory wipe Jack continues to have dreams of a woman from his past (Olga Kurylenko) and when a ship crashes on the planet with her on board (in a sleeping capsule) his whole life (and what he thought he knew) is forever changed. The movie of course has amazing visuals and is breathtaking to look at (any idiot can tell that from the previews though), what I enjoyed just as much as the special effects though was the story. It's involving and full of surprising twists and turns (although it does get a little too complicated towards the end, at least for me). It really does have that classic 70s/80s sci-fi feel to it and I'm sure most fans of the genre will eat it up. Kosinski proves once again that he's a master of these type of movies but the true highlight of the film is Tom Cruise and his performance. No matter what you think of him as a person he is one of the most talented movie stars working in Hollywood today. He always gives 110 percent and this film is no different; you can really feel his emotions and passion every step of the way. The character and his drama isn't quite worthy of such a performance though, and that's the one negative thing about it. The film does still work on all levels though; it's not a masterpiece but Cruise does masterful work in it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",Oblivion
35,Buddy-51,Visually impressive sci-fi drama,7,8 January 2014,"It's 2077. The Earth has been rendered virtually uninhabitable after an alien invasion that took place sixty-some years earlier. Even though the humans technically ""won"" the war (using nuclear weapons which pretty much wiped everything out), most of the planet's survivors have long since moved to a colony on one of Saturn's moons, leaving behind only a handful of people, like Tom Cruise's Commander Jack Harper, as part of the "" mop-up crew,"" whose job is to repair drones and to make sure the alien remnant known as the ""scavengers"" don't interfere with the continued production of fusion power from the oceans that is needed by the humans living up on Titan.Complications arise when Jack rescues a female flight commander (Olga Kurylenko) whose vehicle is shot down by Scavs. Trouble is he thinks he may remember her from a time before he had his memory ""swiped"" as a needed security precaution given the sensitive nature of his job and mission.""Oblivion"" is a visually elegant film from director Joseph Kosinski, adapted from his graphic novel, which was never published. The screenplay by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn has some of the opaqueness of ""Inception,"" as, like a master card dealer, it shuffles the planes of reality to the point where the characters and the audience can't quite make out what is actual and what is a mixture of dreams, memories and alternate realities. Similarly, the filmmakers seamlessly blend CGI action, metaphysics and a surprise, turnabout ending to create a subtle, thought-provoking vision of technology in a post-apocalyptic future.""Oblivion"" takes its time telling its story, more concerned with mood and impression than with whiz bang action and plot details - though it doesn't stint on either of those two things either.Andrea Riseborough, Melissa Leo and Morgan Freeman round out the cast, though Freeman's character feels more plot contrivance than genuine person.""Oblivion"" isn't a completely satisfying movie in the final analysis, but its effective balance of tone and glorious visuals makes it worth watching.",Oblivion
36,thesar-2,Wall-E Returns: Bigger n' Larger,8,6 August 2013,"Without trying to give anything away and beyond the grand scale and excellent cinematography, Oblivion survives and thrives on greattwists.Admittedly, I did want to see this in theatres – yes: I am a die-hard Tom Cruise fan, but I missed it on the big screen. I did think the trailers gave away too much, but that didn't detour me from seeing it. I just got lazy. At any rate, I was wrong.The sneak previews for Oblivion only made me think of a live-action version of Pixar's Wall-E. While, it does begin that way – sorta – and the cinematography in both films is brilliant, fresh and gorgeous, the based-on-a-graphic-novel-idea Oblivion turns into a very nicely written story of ""I didn't see that coming!"" twists.Jack & Victoria are put on a mostly-destroyed Earth of the future to help harvest needed supplies after a tremendous alien war in which humans ""won,"" but now have to reside on a far distant moon. Machines assist, but it's really up to the duo to ensure success. OnlyJack's developing ""unnecessary emotions"" that might disrupt his mission. This leads to that, that leads to discovery and mystery and finally totrue love?Trust me: I haven't given anything (of significance) away. The joy in this movie, again, besides the crisp scenery, is what you'll learn along the way.Now, with all this praise I've given this sci-fi, futuristic yarn, it's not without its problems.At times, it has M. Night Shyamalan (The Happening) and Nicholas Winding Refn's (Only God Forgives) sense of SLOWED DOWN for SUPPOSED SUSPENSE scenes. Yes, I do have a problem with characters slowly walking across the room that somehow translates into tension. I don't buy it and it just drags out scenes. Also, while I am a fan (as stated) of Cruise and the Mission: Impossible series, it was not refreshing to see Cruise reprise his yelling role from the first and weakest entry of that action series. Finally, the movie really produced no real characters I found that broke any mold. While all actors played their part the best they could, none stood out or made me take notice.Thoroughly, beyond my last criticisms, I did have a good time and I look forward to seeing it again. It did have a good portion of action and beautiful scenes. But, most of all, I love how the story played out in the last act.And that moon! What an awesome, albeit terrifying sight!

I was in the mood for a big, actiony sci-fi film and that's what I got, so I'm happy about it.I will acknowledge that, as is mentioned in the many negative reviews here, that there are issues. Cruise is the only fleshed out character, and that only slightly. You have very little sense of anyone else as a person; I felt particularly bad for Andrea Riseborough, stuck in the role of the bland and obedient wife.Some moments ring false, notably in Cruise's first encounter with Freeman, in which everything is done in a very stupid way. And while the movie aims to create some mystery and ambiguity, at times it feels too pat, with moments that seem to just unrealistically to underline a point.But I don't care; I had fun.",Oblivion

39,Robert_duder,Oblivion left me oblivious,6,9 June 2013,"First of all let me say that I think ten or twenty years from now Oblivion will be right up there with Blade Runner, or Moon or any other sci-fi movie that becomes a cult classic that a select group of people rave and worship. There were certainly things about Oblivion that was stone cold brilliant but I'm going to be perfectly honest and just say that I didn't understand a lick of it. I am still desperately trying to figure out the entire concept. The scenery and setting of the film was brilliant. There was this amazing feel of desolation and apocalyptic wasteland that is not to be ignored. The film makers together with their star create this bizarre but so important feeling of melancholy and nostalgia for the way earth used to be. The problem with the film for me was that it dragged significantly. The pacing felt entirely off for much of the film. On top of that this incredibly complex story never really explains itself. Maybe I missed something but it was far more difficult than it needed to be. I guess I just wanted more...more explanation, more details, more background. But that wasn't their intent so I can't fault them for something that maybe I just missed.Say what you will but Tom Cruise is still a superstar. I love the guy. He's had way more amazing movies than bad ones. This film is really perfect for him. He shows an intensity and appropriate emotional level for his character. And of course being Tom Cruise he switches that into action flawlessly. He is still very versatile and makes this film better than I really thought it was. Andrea Riseborough is his partner on the desolate earth station. They have good chemistry and she is very good in a role that I think is meant to be a little wooden. She is almost robotic in her actions but her lack of emotion or at least very stoic emotion is on purpose I believe. In that way she does a good job. Olga Kurylenko is also as good as Riseborough as the mysterious survivor that has a tie to Cruise's Jack. They have good chemistry too although not quite good enough I don't think considering the angle of their relationship. She gets just enough character development to squeak by but I think she could have done more if she had been given more. Morgan Freeman shows up in an unfortunately small role as the leader of a group of rebels. He is good as he always is but the role is excruciatingly small. I wanted to see more dynamic between him and Cruise.It is true that I had some high expectations for this film. I thought it looked awesome, I really like Tom Cruise and sci-fi films and I almost missed this in theatres and finally caught it last minute. Considering director Joseph Kosinski got his big break only a few years with the mega-anticipated sci-fi epic Tron Legacy, you can't say the guy doesn't know sci-fi. He is clearly a talented director. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the direction, the special effects and the world he creates. The only issue is how little I understood the story and the pacing of the film. It isn't that it didn't entertain me but it was just perhaps a little ambitious or perhaps less mainstream than I was expecting. I think I will watch it again when it releases on DVD and re-address the review and until then I encourage you to see it for yourself. I think sci-fi fanatics will love it and perhaps I missed something. For the time being I consider it average for the reasons I discussed. 6/10",Oblivion
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Dull, meandering sci-fi dud",4,12 December 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNearly a hundred years in to the future, Earth has been shattered by an invading army from the skies, and has become a desolate wasteland. In this barren landscape, Jack (Tom Cruise) is one of the few remaining 'drone' operators, who is dispatched from his remote station by his co- worker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) to complete missions. But he is having recurring dreams about Earth and the life he once lived there, which he shares with a mysterious woman named Julia (Olga Kurylenko.) When he comes in to contact with this woman in real life, he is thrown in to a desperate identity crisis where he meets the leader of the invaders, Beech (Morgan Freeman) and the shocking truth of the matter.Opening to decidedly average reviews, Oblivion was another one I forewent at the cinema, in spite of it probably being a film that would have been better suited there. Indeed, sweeping, majestic visuals and cinematography are probably it's main recommendations, for what is other-wise a slow, uninvolving and meandering trip in to nowhere, that fails to draw you in or go anywhere that your average post-apocalyptic action thriller already hasn't. With a plot that features only a few main characters, it really needed a story with some meat and bones on it to keep you interested, and sadly it just doesn't, boring and aimless as it is. It's such a shame so much effort went in to lavish production design and rollicking action sequences, and not as much as in to anything to subsidize it.Cruise, it would seem, remains the go to guy for this kind of big budget, spectacular folly, and as long as it's got a star with his kind of name power on it, it's guaranteed to draw in at least some revenue at the box office. I don't know if it was a hit or a flop, but the reviews would seem to take the wind out of it's sails enough to hint at something probably roughly in between. It's the box office where you have to hit the makers of this kind of movie, because artistically it can take all the flak you can throw at it, but if enough fickle, superficial movie goers go and see it, an even lamer sequel will undoubtedly follow, and go some way to showing them they can get away with it.In title and in deed, Oblivion is better suited as a theme park ride than a film. Maybe it would have been better if it was based on it. **",Oblivion
41,bowmanblue,When will aliens learn not to mess with 'our Tom?',8,8 July 2014,"A race of intergalactic nasties (who obviously didn't watch the War of the Worlds remake) has only gone and waged war on Earth. However, despite the fact they trashed our planet, our man Tom stands defiant against their hordes. C'mon, they don't stand a chance, do they? I may be being flippant, but I actually really enjoyed this film. I won't go into details about the story, as there are a few cool twists and turns along the way. All you need to know is that aliens are trying to mix it with Tom Cruise. When will those xenomorphs learn? You have cool space ships, decent CGI effects, mean-looking robots, space-age costumes and quite a novel spin on the (somewhat tired) alien invasion movie. All in all, the two hours goes by pretty quickly. I did get a bit confused around the midway mark, but I must have been being a bit dim, because, by then end of the film I knew the hows and whys of the movie (and enjoyed them).My only major gripe was that (for the most part of the film) there are only two characters - Tom and his on screen other half. Having such a small cast means you really do have to invest in both of them completely. Tom does tend to overact on occasion and his female partner is a little 'too cold.' By that I mean Tom goes around thinking with his heart and she's all 'head.' Therefore she's the polar opposite of him in every way. And, being Tom Cruise, he's always right.However, that's a minor gripe. It's still a cool sci-fi film. If nothing else, it will act as yet another warning to other aliens not to mess with Earth while we still have Tom on our side.",Oblivion
42,dromasca,when games work,7,6 September 2016,"I liked many things in 'Oblivion', actually more than I expected. I am no fan of computer games, certainly not of these that are dominated by machine guns and laser guns, by cars races and space-ships races - and there are plenty of those in the film directed by Joseph Kosinski. I disliked many of the films that bring to screen heroes and action inspired by comics or graphical novels, and 'Oblivion' is based on one written by the director. And I am not too sympathetic to the action heroes roles that Tom Cruise picks almost exclusively lately, the main reason being that by doing this he buries in the past an excellent actor (hopefully just puts him to freeze). Despite all these wrong starting points, I liked a lot (but not all) in this movie.The story conceived by director, script writer and games creator Joseph Kosinski happens in an uncertain future. The world as we know it ended in 2017. Earth came under attack, Moon was destroyed and the nuclear weapons of Armageddon were used in self defense. Mankind won the war but lost the planet Earth now inhabitable, and will soon be moving to a new home, one of the satellites of Jupiter. It's only that almost nothing of what we see in the first 15 to 30 minutes of the film is what viewers are actually made to believe. 'Oblivion' starts like a very standard comics-inspired film, and as we got used to its world, something happens that is quite unusual in routine movies of its genre. Characters start to develop, they learn about themselves, they ask questions about their own identity. Eventually the movie will turn into the action thriller that it was advertised to be, but this will happen in a smart manner, and the heroes end by being something very different from our initial guesses.A few words about acting. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are two names that do not need any introduction. Cruise gets more opportunities for an interesting role and deals with them honorably. Freeman has a much drier part and cannot make too much to enrich it. The real surprise is Olga Kurylenko, not only fit to the action role, not only looking good, but also acting appropriately in a key role.There are two interesting aspects in which 'Oblivion' breaks the rules of the genre and helps being more than just another adaptation of a graphical novel. One aspect is that the viewers discover together with the heroes that the world where the action is located is something very different from what they thought it is. This complete change in their systems of reference and values doubles with a story line that has clear ecological and political references to the present, although the action takes place in a not very immediate future. The dangers of the new technologies like AI and cloning when they fall into the wrong hands are clearly articulated. The second aspect is that the graphics fit well the idea of the two intersecting and interchanging worlds. In the beginning the film has a very computer graphics game look which describes at perfection the apparently ordered world. Later the border between the artificial and idyllic worlds and the complex realities of the future begin to blur, we see the 'monsters' and realize that they may not be what they seem to be. There is also a political saying about a world where drones play such a central place from fighting the wars of the humans to protecting and saving their lives. 'Oblivion' has many quantities that make if different from the crowd and is definitely worth a try.",Oblivion

They talk to this woman whom is supposedly in a space station and is overseeing their job. One day Jack finds a woman, Julia, in space capsule and he knows her. Then that's when the plot just gets too crazy and it makes no sense. Some how, Jack is a clone and the scavs are humans and aliens are steeling earth's resources, and no one is on Saturn's moon.

44,g-bodyl,Fantastic Sci-Fi Film!,9,2 August 2014,"Oblivion is pure modern science-fiction entertainment and it was a blast to watch. It has an interesting post-apocalyptic story that takes place on a damaged Earth and it raises some interesting questions. Not only does this film require you to think at times, it's a visually-stunning film that has excellent cinematography and plenty of action. Plus, it has Tom Cruise. What can go wrong with Tom Cruise?Joseph Kosinski's sci-fi actioner is about a man named Jack Harper who is one of the last people on Earth along with his lover named Vika because many years prior, the Earth was attacked by extraterrestrial beings causing the remaining inhabitants to relocate to Saturn's moon, Titan. Harper's job is to protect the fusion energy generators which provide the power. But after discovering this mysterious woman who crash-landed on Earth, Jack begins to question his entire existence.This film is well-acted and that is one of the highlights of this film. Tom Cruise is a max-effort actor and once again he shows why. He brings commitment into his role as Jack Harper and he made his character very interesting. Morgan Freeman is excellent, but he is not in the film as much as the trailers or posters would suggest. But his role is very pivotal. Melissa Leo is creepily cheerful in her role, but you'll know why once you see the film. Finally, our ladies are not only attractive, but they do well as the much younger love interests of Tom Cruise.Overall, Oblivion is a fantastic, action-packed sci-fi film that is a wonderful time. Based off the some the reviews I read, I wasn't keen on seeing this film. But once again, time proves again that movies are subjective. Despite the reviews, I enjoyed every part of this movie.

It's an amazing spectacle which is one of the highlights, it clearly did not rely too much on green screens, building sets and taking the cast out in to real landscapes, which is much more effective than an abundance of CGI. However, the plot was very convoluted at times, I understand it's a Sci-Fi, but it got very carried away with itself, the twist towards the end is very much like an episode of the Twilight Zone, although it delivers more confusion than shock and awe for the audience. The cast is terrific, Tom Cruise shines in the lead role, managing to swiftly convey the emotions of this complicated character, he also shares great chemistry with Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough, throwing Morgan Freeman in to the mix only adds to the top notch performances. While the ending raises more questions than it does answer, Oblivion is an enjoyable movie with a stellar cast and a beautiful spectacle, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or Sci- Fi.

But as far as Sci-Fi epics goes, it's a pretty entertaining two hours or so. This is not a very original Sci-Fi picture. It borrows from movies, such as Total Recall, 2001 Space Odyssey, among others. My argument to those bashing this movie is that many movies are derivative at this juncture. There are some movies that are original these days, but the problem is that so many things have been done. My advice is to ignore the plot holes, the derivative nature, and just try and enjoy yourself. If you manage to do that, you'll probably have a good time. It's fantastic visually. The damaged earth from the war is amazing to look at. The special effects are truly a sight to behold, and it's hard not to be floored by them. My favorite has to be the waterfalls. They were truly breathtaking to look at. The story is a bit jumbled, and a tad weak, I have to admit. I would have liked to see more background on Cruise & Kurylenko. We only get brief snippets from flashbacks a few times during this movie about their past love. More meat behind their love story would have really made this movie all the more entertaining. I did enjoy their chemistry, and the love story was above average, but considering how powerful they were trying to make it, more effort was necessary. Tom Cruise is as reliable as ever. He has a commanding presence that you can't help but enjoy. I wouldn't call it his best performance by any means or even in a Sci-Fi movie (That honor goes to Minority Report) but he has charisma to spare, and he carries this film like a champ. I don't really pay attention to his real life antics. He's one of my favorite actors, because of his talent, not his personal life. I felt his character did regain some of his memory a bit too quickly, but that's a minor carp. Olga Kurylenko is gorgeous, and does well for the most part. She actually conveys her emotions decently, and held her own very well. I enjoyed her. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of all time, but he doesn't have much of a part in this one. I relished every chance that I got to see him on screen, but I think he was just here to add star power. He did just fine with what he was given, but a better character would have been appreciated. Andrea Risenborough gave the best female performance here in my opinion. I felt she was excellent. Melissa Leo is fitfully menacing, and her character has a nice homage to 2001 Space Odyssey. Final Thoughts: It has many derivative elements, I must admit. The story isn't as strong as I'd have liked, but I had fun for the most part. The action & visuals deliver.

53,tabuno,An Almost Perfection Fusion Sci Movie,9,17 January 2019,"18 April 2013. A great movie even with the unnecessarily and perhaps outdated use of switches and manual instrumentation for Tom Cruise's bubble cruiser, an almost nauseating voice-over narrative at the beginning unlike the acceptable to some voice over of Blade Runner (1982), a patently fake looking lunar moon, and the disappearance of a major female character occurring off camera. This is one of those movies where such flaws are easily overcome by the rest of the visual spectacle, artistic landscape and set design, and of course the storyline. What is fascinating about this tent-pole sci fi psychological action thriller extravaganza is that it isn't all that original, but nevertheless with its tight fusion of previous incarnations that are so well weaved into the storyline, producing a substantive film with two compelling twists offering an American theme ending that it becomes more than its parts and becoming a very well made movie.There are strong elements taken from Total Recall (1990) and improved on, devoid of the stereotypical arch enemy and false persona and replaced both by an underlying emotional humanity as well as a detached alien presence. There are elements of The Matrix (1999) but not as eerily and epic-like presentation retaining more of simplicity and uncluttered landscape of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1982) but incorporating elements of awesomeness as found in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and psychological unbalancing as found in Source Code (2011). The twists in this movie is similar to that found in Moon (2009) which focused more on the singular psychological and ethical aspect of a man confronted with loneliness and in which Oblivion finds a way to expand of the more tortured and dichotomous incongruity of the multiplicity of human life or that of a man having to face up to what had been an entire illusion one's existence as in Planet of the Apes (1968).Even so, Oblivion manages to retain a persistent theme of love and intimacy Fahrenheit 451 (1966) and as convoluted as Solaris (2002). The musical sound track resonates in places as symphonic as those found in Electric Dreams (1984) or Wavelength (1983). Other familiar themes may have been taken from Tom Cruise's own Minority Report (2002) and Surrogates (2009) as well as one of the sci fi classics of all time Blade Runner (1982) that dwelt with human identity and emotional connections in a dystrophic future.As an afterthought, the voice-over at the beginning of the movie actually is quite clever and relevant if one ties it to the ending of the movie.",Oblivion
54,ironhorse_iv,"Tom Cruise and this movie are an effective team, Sally. It's another day in paradise",7,24 July 2013,"The best way to describe Oblivion is the Modern Day 1968's 2001 Space Odyssey. It's a movie that really makes you think, so it's a great Sci-fiction movie. I think a lot of critics are bashing it because the fact that Tom Cruise is a scientologist, and the film mimics a bit of their faith. In my opinion, I can care less about Tom Cruise's personal life, as long as the movie he is starting in is good. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan but when he hit all the right notes and his acting is great, it makes a good movie. Still, it's wasn't a big attempt into character acting; it was Tom Cruise acting like Tom Cruise. Tom plays Tech 49 Jack Harper, one of the last drone repairmen stationed on a nuclear wasted Earth in the year 2077 who works for Sally (Melissa Leo), his mission commander, who is stationed on the ""Tet,"" a massive tetrahedral space station above Earth. The planet was nearly destroyed sixty years earlier, during a nuclear war against an alien race known as Scavengers or Scavs for short where the Scavs destroyed the moon, causing massive earthquakes and tsunamis. He starts to question his assigned when a pre-war spacecraft crash on the planet and Jack finds a survivor name Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who tells him a different story then what he is supposed to believe. I just couldn't get interest in Olga's acting in this film. Her thin Russian accent was bothering me. Without spoiling much away, I have to say that the film is full of twists to the point, I thought I was watching a better version of M. Night Shyamalan's 2013's After Earth. Plus, all the twist do make sense in the end. It's not a prediction movie, but you have to accept what you got when you finally get to the bottom of the rabbit hole. I do hate the 1996's Independence Day like ending. I do question, what happen when the other Techs end up finding Julia after the ending. The trailer doesn't do this movie justice. This post-apocalyptic science fiction film is based on Director Joseph Kosinski's Radical Comics-edited unpublished graphic novel of the same name, but the movie felt like I said before, 2001 Space Odyssey. Not only that, but I also have to say 1972's Solaris and 2011's Another Earth, because both films deal with thoughts of motivation, the characters beliefs and memories, and reconciling what was lost with an opportunity for a second chance. In Oblivion, Jack is haunted by a woman, from a past that he did not live, and force to confront it. While at the same time, he is trying so hard to keep it away so that his lover Victoria ""Vica"" Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) who work with him as a team to maintain the autonomous drones can leave the planet and join the others in Titan. I love Andrea Riseborough in this role, not only is she beautiful, but the way she acts is both chilling and heart-broken. It's sad what ends up with her character in the end. Things get more complex for Jack when he also meets a 1999's Matrix's Morpheus type character Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), another survivor who tells him that what can describe as this movie version of 'the cake is a lie' by urging him to seek the truth in the so-called ""radiation zone"" that Jack is forbidden to enter. What he find is shocking. I was pretty impress. I do like the visual effects in the movie. It's beautiful. Too bad, the movie stays too much on the remains of the northeastern United States, I would have love to see more of this world. The way, the director shot the clouds, and landscape is amazing to watch. If you had the option to watch it in 3D or IMAX. Do so, the sound & visuals are breath taking. Deserves numerous viewings there. The soundtrack by M83, Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapane sets the mood. I listened all the 30 tracks of the soundtrack, and I gotta says the soundtrack itself is the truly masterpieces. Daft Punk did a really nice job as well. There are some faults in the film, don't get me wrong, but some of these critics are deeply wrong. I think a lot of people didn't understand what was going on, or missed key points in the plot. I think a lot of critics think it's ripping off a lot of Sci-fiction films. In my opinion, it's playing tribute to them, while also using creative something new out of old ideas. I'm willing to buy a number of things for the sake of narrative, but one thing that bug me about the film is the lack of chemistry moments between Jack and Julia. I felt more for Victoria and Jack then them. I felt the ending where Julia and 'Jack' reunited was a bit of a cop out. It wasn't needed and should had been cut. It was very weak setup for one lame predictable final twist. Overall: I found the movie entertaining and liked it quite a bit, but it has the slight un-originality that will keep it from being great. Worth checking out in my opinion. Will recommend this to friends that like science fiction movies, good fun.",Oblivion
55,nairtejas,Now This Is What I Call A Great Sci-Fi Package! ♦ 82%,8,4 August 2013,"Starting off with a story of a couple who are on a mission. Watch 15 minutes and the plot looks clear. Further ahead are two or three twists that will blow your mind out.The screenplay & direction is something to be lauded. CGI & VFX are very good. But, the score & SFX are better. Not boring with ridiculous melodramas, the plot revolves around post-apocalyptic-war. Lots of action sequences involved with gun battles, drone attacks & like. Tom Cruise looks old but his demeanor is fantastic & apt for the portrayal he pulls off. Supporting cast is fine, but I am unhappy with Olga Kurylenko for her wooden expressions.Music is enchanting which gives that ""Inception"" feeling. Climactic scenes are jaw-dropping & slightly ennui-ridden. The climax reminded of a Bollywood film (Paheli).BOTTOM LINE: A very good experience, inducing wonder. 8.2 it is!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

56,The-Sarkologist,Deconstructing the lie,9,26 April 2013,"I know people don't like spoilers so as well as marking this commentary as having spoilers I will also make mention here that this is not a review but a commentary. The reason I say that is because I am writing to people who have seen the movie already and want to actually think about some of the ideas that come out of it. Granted, the effects and the cinematography were brilliant, but it is the underlying themes that tend to grab me more.Basically, the movie spends about fifteen minutes constructing a lie, and the rest of the film dismantling it. The story, as we are told, is that Earth was invaded by a race known as the scavengers, and while we managed to defeat them, it left the Earth a desolate waste, so a space station, known as The Tet, was built as a gateway to colonisation on Titan. However, what becomes clear is that this is the story that is being told by the hero, Jack, and the only people that we encounter at the beginning of the film is Jack and his wife Victoria.However, this is all a lie, and this lie begins to unravel fairly quickly. We are told that Jack had an obligatory memory wipe, as did everybody who went to Titan, but the question is, why was their memory wiped? Is there something about the past that we are not meant to know, or is there something about the present that is being kept hidden from us. Then there are the scav, we don't actually see them, and when we do, we are left wondering who they are (I thought they were robots). Also, there is the radiation zones, why is it that Jack is not meant to travel into the radiation zones. All of that is revealed.While there is the concept of loneliness in this film, it is the veil that is the lie that seems to stand out. Jack and Victoria have everything provided for them, including information. They are not meant to ask or to question any of this information, and there is no reason not to. The destruction of the Earth is quite evident, and the lack of humans on Earth is also quite evident. In fact that exist behind a veil that is impossible to pierce. The only form of information that they receive comes from The Tet, and neither Jack nor Victoria have any reason to question it.Events move to actually change, and challenge this lie. For instance, Jack has these memories that he cannot explain, because they were supposed to have occurred before he was born. Then there is a ship that comes crashing to Earth, and despite being forbidden to travel to that ship, he does so anyway, and it is at this point that the lie begins to unravel, and the veil that has been thrown across his face is beginning to be pierced.That is the thing about Jack, he does not blindly accept, he questions, and while Victoria attempts to challenge some of those questions, she does not have absolute control over Jack, nor does Susan, the commander on The Tet. We see this because Jack has created his own home away from home, where he has taken books, and built himself a house, in a peaceful valley. He will disappear there, and both Victoria and Susan are oblivious to its existence.In many ways this is a reflection of our society – the loneliness despite being among people, and the perpetual lie that we are meant to accept and not to challenge. Jack is an everyman, he is every one of us, who go about their daily job, and hoping for that time when things will be better. However, Victoria represents that aspect of our lives that prevents us from questioning the lie, while Susan is the human face of the lie. What makes Jack unique from the everyman is that he questions, he investigates, and he is willing to listen even though what he is being told may undermine the safe environment that he has built around himself.",Oblivion
57,slightlymad22,Phone It In Freeman,7,19 February 2015,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Oblivion (2013)Plot In A Paragraph: In the year 2077, Jack (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairmen, and is one of the last remaining humans assigned to Earth, its surface devastated after decades of war with the alien Scavs, discovers a crashed spacecraft with contents that bring into question everything he believed about the war. In the late eighties (starting with 'Street Smart' opposite Christopher Reeve) and particularly the early to mid nineties. Morgan Freeman could do no wrong in my book. A wonderful actor who brought a touch of class to every movie he made. Then something happened, every movie maker and studio caught on to the fact, and he suddenly became the 'go to' guy. Then suddenly he was everywhere releasing several movies a year, all of varying quality. Often he was in supporting roles. Some were still enjoyable (Million Dollar Baby, Bruce Almighty and Now You See Me) some were not (take your pick) and you often think ""I hope he was well paid"" as he clearly took this for the money. Oblivion is one of the latter, he turns up for his big pay check in return for small screen time, in which he pretty much sleepwalks through the movie. Cruise can rarely be accused of phoning it in, but despite the concept, this movie seemed very same old, same old from him. It was over long and I'm not 100% sure I fully understood what happened!!That said, Olga Kurylenko definitely brightens things up when she is on screen! However sadly Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jamie Lannister in Game Of Thrones) is not given as much to do as one would hope. I didn't hate this movie, it was watchable. I just didn't really care about what was happening!!Oblivion grossed $89 million at the domestic box office to end 2013 as the 41st highest grossing movie of the year.",Oblivion

59,Dr_Coulardeau,Too many borrowed pieces in this patchwork,8,18 September 2013,"This film is a fairy tale and I guarantee you it will end well. But it is also a patchwork of plagiarized elements.The earth was destroyed, a destruction caused by the destruction of the moon by some not really specified cosmic war. The earth then turned into a wasteland submerged by tons and tons of dust, earth and rocks. The ruins are thus underground. The Golden Gate Bridge is reduced to two pillar tips sticking out of that dirt. That's a rewriting of H.G. Wells the Time Machine.Two humans are living in the ring of satellites that overlook the waste land with a company of drones that are supposed to destroy all signs of life. Jack Harper is the man and the woman is supposed to be his wife. Jack Harper's memory has been erased to enable him to carry out his mission. Total Recall, second episode, the sequel. Everyday Jack Harper is supposed to go down on the surface to revive the drones that have been downed in the night. There is thus some kind of hostile life on this planet, living underground of course. That's Star Wars revisited. An underground resistance has been so often used that listing all the plagiarized connections would take many pages. That implies at this moment that the surviving humans who have fled the decaying planet are controlling the situation from some distant artificial planet. That is a black star like in Star Wars again. But who are these escapees?But memory-deprived Jack Harper knows where there is a secret valley that is as primeval as the Garden of Eden. There Jack Harper has a cabin with electricity and a pile of vinyl records and a record player and all kinds of heirloom and he plays his records everyday when he manages to escape from the control of his ""wife"" on the surveillance satellite. The drones have never found that place. I guess Jack Harper's lost memory was not lost completely and the drones are not very swift.Then one day a spacecraft crushes on the surface and there are four or five sleep-boxes with hibernating human beings in them. This spacecraft was called by a strange signal from the underground resistance. The drones are destroying the sleep-pods. Jack Harper saves one and takes the woman inside to his satellite base. The reaction of his official wife shows there is a real problem there. When he takes the woman to recuperate the ""black box"" of the space craft they are captured by the resistance and then things become iffy.Let's have one more trip ""Back to the Future"" and then we have two Jack Harpers and maybe or maybe not two women and this saved woman (or her and her double) is revealed to be Jack Harper's real wife, two real wives and two real Jack Harpers. Then the initial Jack Harper recuperates some kind of memory. With the help of the resistance under attack from drones, he realizes that he has to fulfill the mission the other Jack Harper – but that is him in a way, at least if you accept the concept of doppelgangers – and his wife were entrusted with: to destroy the black star.Officially one of his real wives is hidden in the secret valley, the other one is set in the sleep pod that is going to be delivered by one Jack Harper to the black star with a bomb in it. When he finally reaches his destination, o divine miracle, the wife has been swapped and replaced by the leader of the resistance who is dying of a wound gotten in the last battle against the drones. But the bomb is here, Jack Harper is determined and the final an massive attack of drones against the resistance is under way.What will happen? A happy happening and glorious ending of course. The black star crumbles, the drones are grounded, the resistance is saved, the wife has a child and two or three years later the surviving Jack Harper reaches the secret valley with the resistance and we are in a Grimm-like ending when they are happy ever after, ever after Snow White's step mother dies dancing in red-hot metal shoes. If you like soft horror fairy tales, rush to this one. Otherwise entrust it to your children who might have soft nightmares in the night. You will have to cuddle them with love.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Oblivion
60,zkonedog,Science Fiction In Its Purest Form,8,5 March 2017,"Generally speaking, my favorite films are the ones that are pretty much genre-diverse. Yet, if I do break down into genres, my favorite is science fiction. That is the reason for the five-star ranking of ""Oblivion"", as it is simply the purest form of sci-fi put to film.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees the team of Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) monitoring the water-removal from Earth after the planet has been decimated by attack (""we used the nukes"", says Jack in an opening montage). On one ""away mission"", however, Jack is blind-side by Beech (Morgan Freeman), the leader of a gang of rogues that changes everything that Jack has ever believed in (or thought he believed in).Plot-wise, this is science fiction at its finest. It is part other-worldly, part cautionary tale, part human drama, and all adventure throughout. For those who have watched a lot of sci-fi, all the basic ""landmarks"" of such stories are touched upon. It doesn't get old or feel re-hashed, though, as director Joseph Kosinski makes sure to keep the proceedings on track and moving forward.The visuals of ""Oblivion"" are also spectacular. You'll feel as if you truly are in the future via the use of interesting, integrated new technologies. This isn't one of those ""all visuals"" movies, by no means, but it would be more accurate to say that the visuals perfectly complement the story lines and characters.Overall, sci-fi fans will love ""Oblivion"" for its ability to make the mind wonder. It might not be the flick for everyone, but if it looks even at all intriguing to you it's a pretty good bet you'll at least find it somewhat enjoyable (if not much more so).",Oblivion
61,Floated2,Overly long running and quite boring,4,12 June 2016,"Oblivion is a sci-fi film summer blockbuster starring Tom Cruise. The audience there spends two hours in the year 2077 in a post apocalyptic corner of Earth in the company of computer-generated drones, supersize spacecraft and a mechanic who lives in a beautifully designed mansion 3000 feet in the air.Into the film, we can see that Cruise (Jack Harper) plays the last man on Earth. The film has its tend of storyline plots derivative from other films, where a war between humans and space invaders has left the planet, and the remainder of the race has decamped to a space station. Jack lives with a state-assigned girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) and maintains a fleet of machines guarding what's left of the world from further attack.Although Oblivion is visually stunning (had a major budget gone to use), the film tends to drag on quite a bit and rarely does anything of interest occur It is a slow paced film and for this kind of science fiction film it does not work, in my opinion. Comparing Oblivion to another Tom Cruise sci-fi/action film such Edge of Tomorrow, many can agree that Edge of Tomorrow is far more entertaining, has better writing and is overall a thrilling ride. As a rewatch 10/02/19' Oblivion has great visuals and is well done looking but the story is quite boring and confusing. Not much of interest in its story.",Oblivion
62,eddie_baggins,Entertaining if not memorable,6,10 September 2013,"After the visual stimulus that was TRON:Legacy director Joseph Kosinski has again crafted a feast for the eyes and a movie hard to appreciate on an emotional level. Oblivion looks the goods thanks to its naturally stunning Iceland vistas with added CGI effects but it's a film that's not as grand as it thinks it is and a film that sadly isn't as pretty as it wants to be.Oblivion aims for the epic and doesn't reach it. The story of Tom Cruise's repairman Jack allows for lots of character development and growth but no matter how much Jack develops there is never a real sense of connection to his character or those of the female leads in Anna Riseborough as Victoria and Kurylenko as Julia. Another aspect that works against Oblivion is very weirdly the kitsch look of the whole film, diminishing the hard work of the movie and its backstory history.For a film that cost in the vicinity of $120 million Oblivion looks awkwardly cheap in its effects and props. Examples of this can be seen in Morgan Freeman's wardrobe (seriously why is Freeman chuffing on a cigar?), the films weapons and vehicles and the final act of the film has some of the worst CGI this side of Sharknado. If Kosinski wants his visions to meet their full potential more attention needs to be paid to how the film looks as a finished product.With all this negative talk it must be said that thanks to the intriguing enough story and mystery the film presents Oblivion is always watchable and there are enough well-constructed scenes to keep the viewer glued to their seat. In regards to Tom Cruise no matter what the naysayers can come up with, the man can act and here holds the film with his presence. Kosinski is an interesting director and one can feel soon enough a movie for him will click not just visually but emotionally and when that day comes it will be a joy to behold.P.S – someone give GOT's The King Slayer (Coster-Waldau) a decent role already! 3 drones out of 5 For more reviews and opinions on movies check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Oblivion

The script seems interesting at first glance, but we soon lost interest in the film because the story does not have much else to explore. Tom Cruise plays the main character and does it in a very correct way, but his character is overwhelmingly boring and the story is very monotonous. Morgan Freeman is another actor who excels in this film, leading a good cast that has received a bad material to work because of the poor script, with good ideas but poorly developed. The big bet of this movie is CGI, with great plans of our planet destroyed, especially New York. Visually, the movie is great, with optimal cinematography and superior quality sound effects.

64,leonblackwood,Takes ages to get going. 3/10,3,18 August 2013,"Review: What a load of rubbish. I was wondering why I didn't hear anything about this movie, and now I know why. The storyline was quite terrible and it I lost interest after a while. I did get a bit confused near the end, but I wasn't that bothered. Morgan Freeman's part could have been played by anybody because he's only in a couple of scenes. There isn't that much action so you just end up watching Tom Cruise for 2 hours, trying to work out what the hell is going on. I also found his wife pretty annoying but the CGI was pretty believable. I was expecting something amazing to happen throughout the movie, but as usual, nothing really did. The whole tempo of the movie and the fact that there isn't much of a cast, is what made the film extremely disappointing and it just seemed to drag. What a waste of $120million.Round-Up: Tom Cruise has really gone down in my estimation lately, with movies like the disappointing Jack Reacher, he needs to pick another avenue. As usual, his movies always make there money back so the studios will always be giving his projects a big budget, but the last good movie that I saw him in was Tropic Thunder were he was acting completely out of his comfort zone. Morgan Freeman looked a bit out of place in this film, for some unknown reason, but I did like the robots. I hope they don't come out with a sequel to this film because I personally don't care what happens to the characters. I did end up falling asleep a couple of times because it takes about an hour before anything really happens so be warned.Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $286millionI recommend this movie to people who like there futuristic end of the world type of films with Tom Cruise being the hero. 3/10",Oblivion
65,TheMovieDiorama,"Oblivion is, personally, one of my favourite modern sci-fi films.",8,25 February 2018,"Honestly, I do believe this is supremely underrated. Now I know I will be in the minority with my opinion, and that's perfectly fine. After all, I gave ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" a solid nine (loooove it). Anyway, in a ravaged and desolate futuristic Earth a tech team are stationed on the planet to ensure hydro rigs are fully operational before being sent to Titan where humanity currently resides. However, they must battle against ""Scavengers"" who set out to destroy these rigs and droids. Why? What could possibly be the reason? Well...stay away from the hideous trailer, unfortunately it reveals far too much. So aside from the hideous marketing, this film is incredible. I've seen it a good twenty times and never get bored. Again, I know most of you will disagree with me...but all the ingredients for a thinking sci-fi are there and unequivocally are blended to make a memorable film. This is two for two for director Joseph Kosinski as far as I'm concerned. ""Tron: Legacy"" is a personal favourite, and so is this. He makes visual audio experiences. The visual effects here are gorgeous, from the clean white architecture to the desolate horizon. Everything looked outstanding, particularly the interior of 'The Tet'. Then we come to M83's soundtrack which is an entrancing piece of synthesised electronic goodness. The two technical aspects compliment each other so well to create, not just a film, but an experience. You guys know me by now, I will always have a soft spot for technically accomplished films. The acting is slightly monotonous, but it works for the environment that they are in. Andrea Riseborough is a personal favourite of mine, she's damn good in everything. The story has plenty of twists and turns, particularly when breaching the Radiation Zone. A few scenes of exposition and narration but not enough to become a detriment to the narrative.

Like in War of the Worlds the sci-fi stuff just seems to fit Mr. Cruise and/or he gets offered very good scripts in this genre.

67,digitalbeachbum,Predictable from the first few minutes.,1,6 September 2021,"I had put off seeing this movie but it was free on one of the streaming services so with nothing better to watch I thought I would give it a try.From the very first opening scenes, through the fifteen minute mark I had the entire movie figured out. The movie copies several writing techniques from other stories which I believe caused me to dig in to my memories subconsciously to see the outcome.There are several problems with the story, fallacies and what I call reverse deus ex machina. Fallacies being logical errors and deus ex machina being the moment when the writers resolve a problem for the main character suddenly and abruptly with an unlikely occurrence (better known as the god out of the machine). However, that isn't what happens in this movie. The ending is actually a good solid ending, but the negative deus ex machina is when you create a situation of tension before the ending, to make it appear that the hero(s) has failed, only to have the situation resolve itself suddenly and abruptly with a predictable resolution.This movie has its moments, but every thing was predictable to me. I knew everything before it happened. I knew how every scene would resolve itself. There was no mystery to me.For that reason and that reason alone, I must fail this movie. There were good special effects. There was good dialog. There was good cinematography. However if the writers can't keep me interested in the movie it all falls apart and I end up disliking it, even if everything else is good.Things I figured out in the first fifteen minutes. I knew Sally was an artificial life form, I knew that Jack was a clone. I knew that Julia (the woman in his dreams) was his wife. I knew that Vika was a clone. I knew that the radiation zones were fake and only in place to prevent the clones from bumping in to each other. I knew that the scavs were humans. I knew the Tet was alien. I knew there was no Titan. I knew the water was being stolen. I knew the humans lost the war. I knew that they had to blow up the mother ship with a nuke.",Oblivion
68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Artistically splendid sci fi with enough soul,8,14 August 2013,"""Oblivion"" is so visually crisp and clean that you could actually brush your teeth with it. Director Joseph Kosinski, who pieced together the aesthetically immaculate ""Tron: Legacy"" takes a similar approach in adapting his graphic novel for the big screen, and with some solid screen writing help, ""Oblivion"" feels especially worth of the ""science-fiction"" label.""Oblivion"" moves beyond post-apocalyptic fiction clichés by borrowing some from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the sci-fi indie ""Moon."" It fixes squarely on its main character, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), which is simultaneously a strength and a point of weakness, but most importantly prevents it from getting too emotionally hollow.The key is that ""Oblivion"" successfully deceives its audience and keeps things mysterious and exciting for two hours, even if its very nature demands a lot of skeptical questions.Harper is a drone repairman in 2077, 60 years after Earth was ravaged due to an alien attack on the moon. Drones keep an eye out for stranded aliens attempting to spoil humanity's last-ditch effort to harvest ocean water so life can continue on one of Saturn's moons. Jack lives with his partner in life and work, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), but he dreams of another woman (Olga Kurylenko) and the past in New York City, which he cannot understand because that was before he was born. When he discovers the woman in his dreams in a crash-landed pod on Earth's surface, it unleashes a whole set of questions.Buying into the film and this story turns out to be pretty easy thanks to Kosinski's pristine direction, and the poetic voice-over narration throughout ups this film to above-average sci-fi movie intelligence. A strong artistic vision and an intriguing story are pivotal in any movie that's part of a genre so steeped in suspension of disbelief; ""Oblivion"" has those hooks firmly in place.Any sci-fi film involving a comprehensive context/backstory will draw plot hole or logic skeptics like a wake of hungry buzzards, and ""Oblivion"" compounds those issues with its plot twists and an ending that seems far more simple than the rest of the film. The satisfaction of the result doesn't have to be connected to the excitement of watching it unfold and there's a definite difference in this instance.The actual issue is that all the time spent on exposition, explanation and Jack's character doesn't leave too much room for the rest of the cast. Morgan Freeman's role as a leader of a group of survivors doesn't have as much weight as the script would like to believe it does and his right hand, played by Nickolaj Coaster-Waldau amounts to nothing more than a moment of ""whoa, it's Jaime Lannister!"" The script doesn't satisfy our curiosity to understand them and learn more about them. We care way more about what happens to Jack.A few shallower areas, however, are no indicator of a hollow core. ""Oblivion"" is far more than just visual flair and a pulsing contemporary score.

Granted I had already seen Edge of Tomorrow, which was decent Tom Cruise film, but then again I had also seen War of the Worlds, which was awful. But, Oblivion managed to surprise me. Not only was Tom Cruise well-suited for the role as a lone technician, looking for meaning in an abandoned world, but the whole film was beautifully designed, the story was interesting if a bit clichéd, and as a whole I was entertained from start to finish.The best part of the movie is how it looks. The whole abandoned Earth and the giant machines that scourge its surface to fund humanity's reach for the stars look majestic and the white, sleek designs of the few stations left are beautiful to look at. It has that 00s iPod design vibe to it, but in this film it fits, because the whole landscape supports it with it bleakness.Furthermore, Andrea Riseborough and Tom Cruise have good chemistry together as the two technicians tasked to look after the machines, and while I do think Morgan Freeman was criminally underutilized, it's always a joy to see him any film.The story is a bit clichéd, as I already said, and the end is a bit preachy, going over the same ground every single one of these movies does, but it's told well with good action, well-timed twists and good pacing in general. Enough time is given for the simple appreciation of how the film looks, the dialogues flow smoothly and the only real thing missing is that spark of originality that would have made this a great film instead of ""merely"" good.Oblivion is well worth a watch if you're looking for a decent scifi film with excellent, innovative set designs and a plot that will keep you interested.",Oblivion
70,Turfseer,Big plot twist is not enough to save this standard Cruise sci-fi actioner from mediocrity,5,21 November 2013,"In the U.S., 'Oblivion' grossed approximately $89 million. Overseas it was close to $197 million. What does this tell us? For all those non-English speaking people, the Oblivion narrative perhaps wasn't all that important—special effects and one action scene after another, were the key to the overseas success. Here perhaps word got out that this Tom Cruise vehicle was not as gripping in terms of narrative, as the Oblivion marketing people, led us to believe. There were possible reasons for this, mainly having to do with the nature of the story itself.As I found this sci-fi, action adventure film to be mediocre at best, I have no trepidations about giving away the main twist that the main plot rests its head on. So if you haven't seen the film, I strongly suggest you quit reading here and read some of the more critical reviews found at Metacritic, which don't give away the whole kit and caboodle.We're led to believe that Tom Cruises' 'Jack Harper', is a drone repairman in charge of servicing various sphere-shaped drones that emanate from a tetrahedral space station dubbed 'Tet', run by the 'good 'guys'—the surviving humans, represented by the mission commander, 'Sally', who it turns out is a computer generated entity, similar to the 'HAL' of 'A Space Odyssey'. Harper has been told that the drones service and protect fusion power generators on earth that are supposedly extracting the necessary energy for a plan to have the rest of humanity migrate to the Saturn moon, Titan. All this after an apocalypse on earth, caused by alien 'Scavengers'. Harper believes that humans defeated the 'Scavs' after they destroyed the moon, decimating earth due to the resulting gravitational shifts. Remnants of the Scavengers still remain on earth, attempting to destroy the drones which must keep the power generators operating.Before the break into the second act of the story, 'Oblivion' operates as a typical sci-fi action adventure flick. Harper's significant other, Victoria (aka Vika), has dramatically little to do, operating the computer console and assisting Harper keep track of the drones back at their house 'in the clouds'. At a certain point, Harper gets involved in a chase with the drones very reminiscent of the chase inside the death star in Star Wars. Finally, things get mildly interesting when Harper saves Julia, a human astronaut in stasis from before the apocalypse on earth. Harper has vague memories of Julia, despite having his memory 'wiped' by his overseers.When Harper discovers that he's a clone, he finally figures out that the 'Scavs' are actually the good guys as they are not aliens but humans who are battling the true aliens, represented by 'Sally' up in the 'mother ship'. So the second half has Harper joining forces with the Scavs, in their effort to destroy the aliens. It turns out that right before the alien invasion, there was a mission to Titan with the original Harper and Vika as the astronauts at the controls. Those two turn back to engage the aliens but before doing so, jettison the rest of the crew (including Julia), who turns out to be Jack's wife before the apocalypse. Harper and Vika are the prototypes used by the aliens to create the clones.'Oblivion' asks us to applaud the twists and turns in the plot, particularly the revelation that Harper is a clone and the Scavs are actually human. But it's not enough to make this compelling drama. The problem is that Cruise is not pitted against a well drawn out antagonist throughout the narrative. Before the 'big twist', Cruise as Harper battles the faceless 'Scavs', who look like rejects from the first Star Wars series. Even after it's revealed that Sally and her minions, are the true villains, Harper spends most of his time battling the antagonists' surrogates: the drones who are constantly trying to annihilate him. This is also true of the first half of Act II—it's the opposition to the drones that basically fuels most of the conflict in the script. 'Oblivion' really is reduced to a standard sci-fi actioner for most of the time.'Oblivion' also feels like an amalgam of many sci-fi predecessors. We've already alluded to 'Star Wars' but one is also reminded of 'Planet of the Apes', in its scenes of a ruined New York City after the apocalypse (here it's the shell of the Empire State Building which triggers Harper's memories of meeting Julia for the first time)—of course in 'Planet', it's the 'Statue Liberty' that gets the end of the world treatment.Both 'Oblivion' and 'I, Robot' have similar antagonists—a female voice which represents an entire computer network. Both 'Sally' and 'VIKKI', serve similar functions and both Will Smith and Tom Cruise must destroy the network in order to save the day. 'I, Robot', however, is much more compelling since Will Smith's character has a complex ally to play off of ('Sonny' the robot). Not so for Cruise, whose strongest ally is Julia (who is hardly what you would call a foil at all).'Oblivion' just rates an average 5.0 out of 10.0 in my book. It's got some nice special effects and that one big aforementioned twist. But in the end, 'Oblivion' is nothing more than a glorified 'shoot em up', with Cruise playing his usual 'good guy' part. I certainly wouldn't discourage the first time viewer from watching it but it's not something I would want to take a peek at, on a second go-round at all.",Oblivion
71,thinker1691,""" The most difficult opponent you'll ever encounter, is yourself """,8,20 September 2013,"This futurist movie was directed by Joseph Kosinski and is a concept long in arriving. The story concerns Earth in the year 2077 A.D. The remnant population of the planet is on a devastated sphere without a viable moon. Living on a Titan moon Jack's base is occasionally attacked by invading 'Scabs' intent on destroying Earth's remaining satellite system. There to repair these satellites is a highly skilled technician named Jack (Tom Cruise) who's task is to keep these drones in working order. Troubled by sporadic memories involving a recurring dream, Jack tries to piece them together while preparing to leave his assigned post. Aiding his daily efforts is his partner Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who periodically states to their celestial boss (Andrea Risebororough) that she and Jack make an effective team. In addition and hidden among the debris of Earth's landscapes is Jack's secret cabin where he longs to return often. However, the troubling dreams become more complex when he saves a survivor from a damaged spaceship shot down in a battles with the Scabs. The remnants of the human race are constantly seeking him out to convince him to join them. Indeed Jack has to deal with them and images of his former wife who wants very much to reunite and remind him of who and what he really is. The movie is crammed with exciting Aeriel action scenes and one is hard pressed to keep up with the explosive scenes of the story. Morgan Freeman is superb as Beech and so too is this lively film which is a fun addition to his movies. Recommended to anyone who likes Tom Cruise. ****",Oblivion

And often confusing,6,26 May 2013,"Usually, I am not much into sci-fi movies, especially when there is fight against technology or vicious creatures not in the know they are doing. On the other hand, I can't remember Tom Cruise performing in a total rubbish... His performance was good again, but the over-sophisticated plot was unclear to me at times (later, I had to read the plot overview to get all things straight). And sophistry on soul, love, memory, power, eternal life, misuse of technology etc. have been exploited in similar movies too many times. True, the sci-fi stuff (incl. battled scenes) was visually catchy and all supporting actors gave good performances, but the movie was too much focused on Jack Harper's character and the approach of topics mentioned above was sometimes too plain and obvious. And I found many similarities with movies like Solaris or Moon.Oblivion was okay, but currently I do not think I will watch this movie again in the future.",Oblivion

74,freemantle_uk,A Collage of Sci-fi,7,18 April 2013,"Sci-fi is a popular stable of fiction and we have seen many great stories in the genre. It is a genre that has many avenues to explore and Joseph Kosinski's Oblivion certainly uses as many sci-fi elements and tropes as possible.The year is 2077 and it has been 60 years since Earth was invaded by an alien race, known as Scavengers, who blow up the Moon. Humanity repealed the invasion but it was a pyrrhic victory, as most of the planet has become uninhabitable and humanity now lives on a space colony on Titan.Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are a mop up crew on Earth, with mission to maintain drones to protect sea based power generators from the reminding 'Scavs'. They are two weeks away to finishing their mission and go to Titan. But despite Jack having his memory erased he keeps having dreams about a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko). He is soon thrown into a conspiracy when the 'Scavs' try to capture Jack and make a signal to bring down cryo-pod in space contending the woman of Jack's dreams, a Russian woman called Julie Rusakova.Oblivion is compilation of sci-fi films and fiction and if you played a drinking game about spotting each of these sci-fi references: you would suffer liver failure by the end of the film. The clearest parallels are with Moon, following its set up, the plot points, the reveal and conspiracy, the other being Total Recall as Jack suffers from confessing memories, not knowing what is real sense of reality is and ending joining the rebel forces. Other sci-fi elements used include the manipulation of reality by a distance Big Brother like entity who creates a common enemy like in Nineteen-Eighty Four, to ideas and scenes used in I, Robot, Independence Day, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The 6th Day. Even the art direction within the tower shares a look with white clear look of I, Robot, Star Trek (2009) 2001: A Space Odyssey and Portal and the imagery of the destroyed Earth looks like it was influenced by The Road and Planet of the Apes.Like Kosinski's previous film Tron Legacy, Oblivion is impressive to look at, with excellent action and lush production design, but the film never fully fleshes out its ideas. It was clear that Kosinski was committed to the film, it was based on his own unpublished graphic novel. He wanted to make more then a sci-fi actioneer and make something more thoughtful as it looks at themes of reality, identity and manipulation. It was certainly a noble attempt but Kosinski lets his film drag and it is a little too easy to think about other sci-fi films during the proceedings.Oblivion certainly felt like it kept to its graphic novel origins: it had grand images, designs and concepts and its strong action. The reveal about who the Scavs really are would worked better on the page but that is because in a comic book it is harder to see what is coming then in a film because of the why they are promoted. Some of the dialogue also felt too comic book like, being very clunky and unnatural.The major fault with the film is it does drag and has at times a slow pace. This is of course a part of the attempt to make Oblivion into a more meaningful film then being an action film. But it does not bring anything new to the table and many of the plot points are predictable, especially if you have seen Moon. Oblivion's editor needed to be a little more ruthless.Whilst Kosinski needs to work a bit more at bringing out his themes and fleshing out idea, he's an accomplished visualist. He does give us a stark view of an empty, destroyed Earth, crumbling away and contrasting it to the ultra-modern, clean look of the tower. Kosinski knows how to shot impressive action sequences and he gives us a lot, from aerial dog fights to gun battles to fist fights. One of the best moments is when the camera follows a drone causing carnage during a battle.Oblivion certainly has a top cast. Cruise continues to show off his leading man credentials and he is a solid presence throughout the film; though he gets to be with two women who are nearly 20 years his junior. It is good to see Riseborough finally getting a major role in a Hollywood film and she gave a really good, quiet and naturalistic performance throughout. Morgan Freeman too looked like he was having fun with his supporting but pivotal role. But Game of Thrones star Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was wasted and underused in his role.Like Tron Legacy, Kosinski brings a major French band, this time M83, to provide the score. Whilst there are some similarities to the score for Inception, it still is a fine score.Oblivion borrows too many ideas and concepts from sci-fi and does not create enough of its own. It is still a solidly entertaining film with its action and intrigue it creates and the actors were certainly demanded to give good performances during the film.A final note, Oblivion offers a true cinematic rarity; they play a Led Zeppelin song!

75,strong-122-478885,... And Led Zeppelin Still Rules Amongst Clones In The Year 2077!?,2,16 July 2014,"Personally, I think that directors like Joseph Kosinski, Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan, who win the bid to direct big-budget, CGI-saturated, Sci-Fi pictures (with PG-13 ratings), are definitely getting off way-way too easy with their job.Since these mega-movies they direct are clearly aimed at the low intellectual-demand of a 13 year-old kid, then these directors (along with the screenwriters) really don't have to give a sweet-damn whether coherency and/or plausibility are at all a factor in the story.No. Just as long as there's ample time given over to the likes of booming explosions, one-on-one combat, and a literal onslaught of heavy-duty CG effects, then that's all that's required to sufficiently satisfy the demand of an average 13 year-old.And this, of course, was exactly the case with Oblivion and its PG-13 rating.Unfortunately, what made Oblivion fall flat on its face even faster than most other nonsensical, PG-13, set-in-the-future, Sci-Fi films was the casting of the 5' 7"" Tom Thumb (oops!)... I mean, Tom Cruise.After being an actor for 33 years now, this would-be priest and Scientology ass-kisser still hasn't improved one-bit in this multi-million-dollar profession that he's chosen. Even today, Cruise still comes across as being just as shallow and one-dimensional as he did back in 1981's Endless Love.Here in Oblivion Cruise couldn't even convincingly play a character named Jack Harper who was a cloned, gum-chewing, ball-capped, little jock, yearning to re-live the big game at Yankee Stadium.What made this particular Cruise-vehicle doubly-unbearable was the ridiculous knock-down, drag-out fight that took place between 2 Harper clones who just happened to cross paths for no apparent reason, whatsoever.What also lost Oblivion some serious points was the casting of that dullard, Morgan Freeman (one of Hollywood's worst black actors) as the self-satisfied, cigar-sucking chump, Malcolm Beech. The truth is Beech had no real purpose in the story. He was just another diversion, plunked into place in order to create some more tiresome conflict with Jack Harper.Just like a piece of perforated Swiss cheese, Oblivion was riddled to the rafters with plot-holes, flaws and inconsistencies galore. This film was truly an insult to any rational-minded, thinking person.And, finally - I think it was absolute crap to hear that in the year 2077 people were still saying trite, meaningless nonsense like ""Oh, my god!"" whenever the element of surprise or shock overtook them.",Oblivion
76,dfranzen70,"Fascinating, visual delight",7,2 May 2013,"A man on a workaday mission in a post-apocalyptic Earth discovers secrets about his home planet - and himself. He comes to realize he's just a simple pawn, that he's been set up. He is, at times, on the run from those who had employed him. If you guessed that maybe this was a Tom Cruise movie, you'd be right. Poor old Tom is always getting set up and having to figure out what's what. But, like his earlier Minority Report, Cruise's latest sci-fi is a lot of fun, beautifully shot and tightly plotted.It's the future, sometime, I forget when. Giant bugs invaded Earth. We kicked their butts with nukes, thus rendering almost the entire planet unlivable. Those who survived the war were shuttled off to eventually settle on Jupiter's moon Titan. Meanwhile, drones are set up in low Earth orbit to monitor and destroy any surviving bad guys, known as Scavs. You know, short for scavengers. Nothing grows. It's a big ol' wasteland, this planet. Jack Harper (Cruise) is a soldier who has the task of being the clean-up crew; he and his colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are in charge of monitoring the drones and the extraction machines that are removing water from Earth's surface to bring it to a huge space station called the Tet, humanity's escape vessel. All Jack has to do each day is check on the drones, fly around in a funny looking ship, and blast away the occasional Scav while ensuring that the rigs gulping down the water are still operational. The Earth at this point is divided into at least two zones: inhabitable (kind of) and radioactive. The rigs are working in the former area, trying to squeeze all they can out of the planet before Jack and Victoria have to head up to the Tet - in two weeks' time. But something funny is going on, down there on Earth. A simple recon mission to check out a rig leads Jack to believe he's not alone down there, and the truth - well, the first truth is shocking enough to him (he's been there a long time, though he has almost no memory of a time before the War), and the second is a stunner to the nth degree. Certainly, to give more information would spoil the film for you. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Tom Cruise movie in which there was a surprise of some sort. And his acting was better than usual, too - he's human, not a cardboard monkey playing dress up. When confronted with the truth, he's as befuddled as we are, which is unusual for a Tom Cruise character; they typically Know It All and Save the Day. Not so sure that's the case here.His Jack also shows quite a bit of depth. We get glimpses of his past, through his own fractured memories. He can't shake them. He dreams about things that seem familiar and yet unknowable. He is introspective and cocky. He is daring, yet unsure. He is human.Morgan Freeman shows up in a role that cannot be explicated here except to say that he's Morgan Freeman. Melissa Leo is Sally, the commander of the Tet who checks in with Jack and Victoria every day to see how those rigs are a-comin' along (Southern accent). Both are excellent as always.I came away from Oblivion with a strong sense of satisfaction. The ending feels right; it's not contrived, it's not forced, it's not really Hollywood. That's not to say this isn't a feel-good movie, because in many ways it is. Just not the way you'd expect from the beginning of the film.",Oblivion

But the Navigators probably have had some say in this, as everything about OBLIVION seems as Scientology-like as BATTLEFIELD EARTH.

It's slow, predictable and riddled with holes, but the production's cache of slick, attractive future tech and constant visual revelations make for excellent diversions. Cruise's sleekly designed equipment is a real science fiction goldmine, visionary in the same sense as Minority Report's giant touch-screen UIs, and the first hour is an outstanding lesson in world-building. The plot eventually falls into too many Cruise / mainstream Hollywood pitfalls, though, and borrows too liberally from other films. Duncan Jones's excellent Moon, in particular, is robbed of all but its subtlety, performances and locale. Still, such faults are hardly surprising by this point and if you were anticipating something more... well, maybe an adjustment in expectations is in order. Perfectly acceptable as a conceptual exercise, but make sure you swallow that grain of salt before viewing.",Oblivion
81,XweAponX,There is More than One of Everything,10,4 August 2013,"Tom Cruise just seems to be getting younger, as long as he does not grow a beard. Whether he is Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible or here as Tech Jack Harper, he never seems to age, and his energy is great. I don't care if he's tapping the energy of some Mothership, he's still OK by me.Speaking of Mothership, there is one in this film that is a real Mother, if we remove the word ""Ship"" from the end and add in something more derogatory.As we get into this film, Jack recites a ""Revisionist Future History"" of sorts. There had been an invasion. The moon has been blown to bits, and all the ""hoomans"" moved away after the ""war"" and are living on Saturn's moon Titan. There are huge water Sucking machines gobbling up all the earths oceans drop by precious drop, supposedly to send it all to Titan. And it's Jack's job as ""Tech"" to keep these things running, along with a bunch of Robotic Drones that kill off apparent left-over ""invaders"" that are still hanging around Earth for some unknowable reason.Jack's assigned wife is ""Victoria"" (Andrea Riseborough) and she's his Comm officer. They report to ""Sally"" (Melissa Leo) who is allegedly on Titan supervising them. It's a ""Mop Up Operation"" as Jack puts it, they have two weeks to go, then they can all go home to ""Titan"" and live happily ever after.But Jack keeps seeing the image of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and it bothers him. He doesn't even know who she is. But lately Jack has been picking up Books and other pieces of remaining culture and he hides them away at some house by a lake, which appears to be an oasis in a land basically barren. It's off the Grid, so Victoria has never seen it - Victoria stays high up in some Sky Nest monitoring the Comms while Jack roams the earth fixing broken Drones. He keeps asking Victoria if she won't go down to the surface with him, but she always refuses.The Robotic Drones are there to kill off the ""Invaders"", Jack can't comprehend why they are still there and why they are so tenacious. There is nothing left, isn't there? We get flashes of their POV now and then along with images of what look like Scurrying Animals. When Jack falls into a pit which is the Public Library in NY City, they don't shoot him. Why?In fact there are two histories running at once, the revisionist history which we are led to believe, and what really happened, which comes to Jack in dreams and visions. Which one is real? And who is this Woman?But all things start getting answered, when an Orbiting Spaceship falls to the earth after 60 years, and who is in it but the Woman which Jack dreams about. As a matter of fact, Jack's world is twisted totally out of proportion from this moment on.What I love about this film is the imagery, it's a totally believable surrealistic landscape of a world devastated. Combinations of CGI and Practical Filming leave no indications where one ends and the other begins. What we have here is an antiseptic High-Tech World above the sky and the remnants of the devastation below. Of particular visual interest is an image of the very top of the Empire State Building sticking out of a sea of sand, for some reason, a signal is sent from this ruin to some place in the sky.But ""Nothing is as it Seems"" and ""There Is More than One of Everything"". These two Axioms form the basis of what is a wholly unpredictable and enjoyable movie. Keep your eyes peeled for Morgan Freeman and the Stuntwoman-Goddess Zoe Bell, because ""Humans show up when they are least expected"".Directed by Newcomer Joseph Kosinski who wrote the original Graphic Novel this was based on, we can be safely assured there are no ""Temporal Causality Loops"" or other gimmicks used by filmmakers. This is wholly original ground, even though it is basically Tom Cruise running around with a Gun- but I have always enjoyed Tom Cruise running around with a gun.The Film's Score co-written by Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese (The Bourne Legacy) is Bookended with a wonderful song performed by M. 8. 3. - So it's new faces all around.",Oblivion

The majority of the narrative is solid, however this film never really hits the emotional response that it was going for and there are huge plot holes towards the end of the film which left me scratching my head. Also most of the performances in this film including Tom cruise are pretty average, but the best performance is definitely by Morgan Freeman and a big negative is that Freeman isn't in the film enough in my opinion.

83,estebangonzalez10,Good way for sci-fi films to start the year!,8,24 April 2013,"¨60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated and nothing human remains.¨Joseph Kosinski broke out as a director in 2010 with TRON: Legacy and before continuing his work on the sequel he took a break to direct his personal project, Oblivion, a sci-fi film which he had previously worked on as a graphic novel along with Arvid Nelson. He successfully adapted the screenplay and has created one of the most visually stunning films of the year. Oblivion looks great and has some terrific sci-fi action scenes with a strong charismatic lead role played by Tom Cruise. The supporting cast is also pretty strong, but the film focuses almost entirely on Cruise. That means that Cruise fans will probably love this film because he pretty much plays himself, while those people that can't stand him will want to stay away from Oblivion. The best thing going for this sci-fi film are the great visual effects, while the weakest part is perhaps that it takes too many elements from dozen other sci-fi films and kind of meshes them altogether. On the positive side I was overall pleased with Oblivion considering at least that the studio took a risk at creating an original premise (and when I say original I mean that it wasn't a sequel, prequel, or reboot of a previous film) and turned it into a fun and cool looking film. I actually enjoyed this movie much more than Kosinski's previous film and hopefully this marks a great year for sci-fi film considering the upcoming After Earth and Elysium. As much as I liked Oblivion, I still have to admit that I felt Prometheus was a much superior film (thanks in most part to better performances). The film opens with a narration from Jack (Tom Cruise) explaining how the Earth was devastated 60 years ago by a war between humans and an alien race known as Scavs who wanted Earth's resources. We won the war, but the planet was devastated after the aliens destroyed part of the moon's mass which caused several natural disasters. The population that managed to survive moved to one of Saturn's moons known as Titan. It's the year 2077 and the only humans on Earth are Jack and his partner Vica (Andrea Riseborough) who live in Tower 49. Jack is a technician in charge of repairing drones which are responsible for guarding the planet from attacks of surviving Scavs. Vica stays in the tower serving as Jack's eyes and maintains communication with Sally (Melissa Leo), the mission commander living on the Tet (a large space ship in orbit around the Earth). They are in charge of safeguarding these giant machines that draw up water from the ocean to process it as energy in Titan. The few surviving scavs try to disrupt this process, but Jack and Vica are only two weeks away from parting from Earth to Titan. However, Jack is feeling nostalgic and is constantly having memory flashes of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and he can't quite figure out who she is since he has had his memory wiped after the war in order to serve his planet. Everything changes when a shuttle crashes on Earth carrying the woman Jack has seen in his dreams. Her name is Julia, and all of a sudden he begins to question everything that he has been doing. I wasn't too pleased with the way Kosinski decided to open the film having Cruise narrate the present situation, but the visuals won me over, and once the action begun I had a great time with the film. Like almost any other sci-fi film I felt there were some plot holes, but didn't make much of them since the film kept me entertained throughout. Oblivion is a little over two hours long, but it has decent pacing and you never feel like the story drags. Morgan Freeman has a supporting role, but really doesn't have much screen time. This is almost all about Cruise's character, which is good although I thought Andrea Riseborough gave probably the best performance of the film. I like Kurylenko, but she doesn't do anything memorable or ground breaking here. Oblivion isn't a perfect sci-fi film, but it is an entertaining one and I had a great time at the movies. If you enjoy science fiction movies you will like Oblivion unless you are picky or expected a totally unique film. There are several moments where you will be reminded of some greater films which this movie was probably inspired by in one way or another (2001, Blade Runner, Moon, Logan's Run, Independence Day, etc). A lot of credit has to be given to Kosinski however for making a somewhat original sci-fi film and making it entertaining. I would recommend this film!",Oblivion
84,Fluke_Skywalker,Human-centric 'Oblivion' is anything but,7,20 August 2013,"'Oblivion' is a tale of two halves. The first half sort plays out like 'Wall-E' meets 'Prometheus'. It's initially intriguing, but it quickly becomes a bit dull. And then Morpheus Freeman—wait, did I just say Morpheus Freeman? *Morgan*. Morgan Freeman—shows up, and it gets all twisty-turny. Not much of the twisty-turny makes much sense, but if you just go with it the pay-off is a bit of good old fashioned Hollywood melodrama and my favorite use of the PG-13 F-bomb since Wolverine's cameo in X-Men: First Class.With stunning visuals, a score that evokes Vangelis and Tangerine Dream (In a good way) and solid performances—particularly by Cruise and Riseborough, who have to carry much of the dramatic water for the film—'Oblivion' is a journey worth taking.",Oblivion

86,jimbo-53-186511,"Improves slightly after a slow start, but it's a little too dry and heavy-going for my liking (mild spoliers)",5,7 July 2019,"The year is 2077 and Earth as we know has been all but wiped out with large areas being uninhabitable due to high levels of radiation being present as a result of several years of war with the scavengers. The slight upshot is that humans won the war and a pair of technicians Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) and Jack (Tom Cruise) are tasked with general security of the earth & maintaining the drones that are used to sweep the area. However, when drones begin to disappear in mysterious circumstances and when Jack discovers a group of survivors who have crash-landed on Earth he begins to question who he once was and what he has now become....Slow-burning and occasionally tedious, Oblivion,, nevertheless does have a moderately interesting story; I did want to find out more about who was down there and how they were surviving etc. It's a good job really that the film has this 'hook' in the first half as a lot of what else we see going on away from Earth isn't all that interesting; Cruise and Riseborough are not a good fit together and their on-screen chemistry is simply awful. Riseborough fares worst overall though as we learn practically nothing about her character (although this is no great loss in the grand scheme of things in that she isn't a particularly compelling character in the first place). I could also have done without some of Jack's silly speeches (he spends considerable time rambling on about a ball game that once took place before the war and seems to remember it quite vividly - remarkable for a man who had his memory wiped out 5 years ago. While we're on the subject, how was Jack able to remember where he lived when his memory had been wiped?Things improve slightly in the second half when Jack begins to learn more about himself and what happened to him 'pre-war' (I won't say anymore than that). However, why it takes around an hour to get to this point is anyone's guess? The second half is better if only due to the pacing and the fact that Cruise shares more screen time with Kurylenko in the second half of the picture and it has to be said that Cruise's chemistry with Kurylenko is arguably better than it is with Riseborough.Although some parts work and some characters have better chemistry than others (as highlighted above) I was a little disappointed with some of the acting; quite a large number of the actors look as though they're reading lines from an autocue and for me a lot of the cast looked a little bored. I appreciate that Cruise tries to play this straight (he's brought a lot of cocky smugness to his films in the past which has always provided mixed results) but I have to admit that seeing him in Oblivion I would have liked to have seen a bit more dynamism and swagger; the truth is that he isn't great here and despite the backstory I didn't find him all that compelling as a character. Riseborough is dull and does nothing of real interest. Kurylenko is of more interest (particularly when we learn who she is), but again there's little development or depth to her character which then falls back on her chemistry with Cruise which as I've mentioned isn't too bad all things being considered. Freeman is OK here, but he's clearly slumming it and Game Of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau isn't given enough to do to really make an impression.For me, Oblivion was far too serious and dry and with a whole host of poorly developed characters it's quite a tough film to endure. This is capped off by a predictable ending which should have been powerful, but due to the fact that I never really grew to know or feel a great deal for the characters I left the film feeling indifferent and unimpressed.",Oblivion

The screenplay also becomes directionless in the middle but will not disappoint you.Tom Cruise has once again proved his already proven potential, Olga and Andrea was good but i was disappointed as Morgan Freeman the power house of talent is wasted as he could've been used much better.Overall the movie is captivating with powerful visuals and good acting.

88,juneebuggy,I liked figuring this out initially until it reminded of every other sci-fi movie I've seen,5,3 February 2015,"This was a very ambitious movie, feeling grand in scale but never really following through. The first half is better than the second, with a slowly revealing plot following Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the last drone repairmen still stationed on Earth. I happen to like movies where you have to figure out what the hell is going on, so this was kinda cool, sorting out what was happening in this future apocalyptic world. Some interesting visual effects in that respect.I did get the plot twists pretty early on though and the second half of the movie kinda fell apart for me. I spent most of it being reminded of other sci-fi movies (Total Recall), (Blade Runner), (Independence Day) and in particular the (Star Wars) saga. With ""Faux-Tom"" and his partner living in cloud city, chasing sand people (Morgan Freeman), land cruisers, canyon chases and even Beech's ""death"" scene reminded me of Darth Vader. The director obviously grew up with these movies.The final bit of cheese was when Jack spouted the now iconic (at least in my house) ""F U Sally"" That got some laughs. 08.13",Oblivion
89,dwpollar,Very good story...,9,7 May 2013,"1st watched 5/4/2013 – (Dir-Joseph Kosinski): Very good story about a drone repairman from the future named Jack Harper, played by Tom Cruise, who believes he is protecting the current Earth from a group called the Scavs – whom they won a war against --- and are gathering resources so that the remaining humans can transport to Titan due to the current Earth being destroyed by nukes. His memory has been erased supposedly, I guess, so the horrors of the war and how the Earth used to be won't cause too much depression, but he has dreams that later reveal some in-accuracies in what he believes to be true. The movie is visually very appealing, and has very few flaws that you really have to work to find, but it's definitely not the type of story to get the Academy's attention(except at a technical level). Despite that – this is the best movie I've seen released in 2013. Jack's dreams eventually connect to an incident where a spacecraft crash lands on the devastated Earth and he saves one girl(who just happened to be in his dreams as well). To say much more would reveal spoilers, and I would rather you watch this movie and see the complicated twists that happen to turn Jack upside-down and make his purpose of existence much different than what he originally thought. Do not miss this one – you will not be disappointed in this graphic novel based future fantasy & sci-fi film.",Oblivion
90,Cristi_Ciopron,'Turn Loose the Drones'('Top Gun' ft. the Tribe of the Future),7,21 June 2013,"I have reviewed this on my _blog—but regardless. There a few exciting moments—Harper's descent in the building (it looked like a church, probably)—in search of the disappeared drone, most of the 'Top Gun' reboots, etc.. Execrably written, OK, maybe that is an overstatement, but within a mediocre script, with modest intellectual means, a comics—level script, There are some flight scenes, generally well done—both Cruise's jet and the drones look good, and perhaps we are spared the comic relief—except in a few drone gags; the overall design really looks good, in a 'SG Atlantis' way, like an ambitious TV show. Cruise is very handsome, and the one actor of his generation who made it to keep a high—level career (only Willis comes close, and Gibson—but not Costner, Rourke, countless others ), but handles badly a clichéd script—and overacts whenever it's possible—fighting with his teammate or as a Walden of the future.The production values are often outstanding. The handful of actors play sometimes annoyingly bad, save for the mentioned Freeman, who takes the chance of some restrained, a bit weary flamboyance, if you take this oxymoron. The score didn't seem remarkable. And you know something, M. Freeman still kicks ass, as hard as ever; I gave a thought to the fact that he played with many leading men from the '80s wave—Rourke, Costner, etc.. There are, at the beginning, impressive panoramas of a deserted world, scarred by nuclear craters and fallen prey to the radioactive storms, vistas of a pained world, the Earth burnt by catastrophes; and I found appealing the images of breathtaking falls through lightning and celestial fire.But 'Oblivion' begins as a movie with aliens, alien invaders, and we know beforehand we are going to see Freeman, which suggests a mystery to come, and we already know the title, and are intrigued about that too .The idea would be that the Tetans don't really control the human clones—therefore, they need to lie to them; the Tetans have won the war, but they need to use human clones in order to—what? They, the clones, are without memory, but not brainwashed.We find nothing about why the Tetans did that, why do they need to use such a device—the army of Harpers, etc.—but then, we are not really curious to find out more, either. But I liked the sense of T. Cruise recovering the zest of his 'Top Gun' days, and of being seemingly ageless. More body combats, and generally physical scenes, like the one in the presumed church, or Tom C. kicking himself, in the desert, would of been endearing.The script doesn't make much sense, and the overall meaning remains quite vague. It's not that the execution fails; the ideas themselves are rubbish.",Oblivion
91,kluseba,A well crafted blockbuster but there would have been even more in this,8,16 May 2013,"From time to time, it can happen that a new American blockbuster hits the movie theatres that is not a prequel, sequel or remake. This is also the case for the effect loaded science-fiction epic ""Oblivion"" and I decided to give the film a fair try.On the positive sides, there are the graphics and special effects. I don't know why this movie didn't get a 3D release. Usually I'm not a big fan of 3D movies and in most of the movies I've seen that way it all just seemed like a quick way to grab some more cash and wasn't all to outstanding but ""Oblivion"" could have become a milestone of science- fiction cinema like ""Avatar"" if a few more efforts were put into these spectacular scenes. Besides that little flaw, the images of this movie are very inspiring.The science-fiction side of the film isn't bad either. The buildings, engines and machines one can observe are very well crafted such as the luxurious main residence, the white flight object and the white motorcycle. Architects and artists will fairly enjoy these detailed inventions. On the other side, the movie didn't only include visual gimmicks but also a few more down to earth aspects. The hidden valley is gorgeous and the remains of several famous buildings of the past make me think of ""The Day After Tomorrow"". I also like the fact that this movie still keeps a focus on the human side. Of course there are spaceships and drones but this movie doesn't include intelligent robots, scary aliens or similar ordinary stuff we have seen over and over again. From that point of view, the film just includes the right mixture between fictional elements and a focus on the human characters.Concerning the artistic aspect, I must also add that the soundtrack of the movie is really epic and well crafted. Until now, it's by far the best score of the year 2013. Along with the flawless score of last year's ""Django Unchained"" and maybe the new blockbuster ""The Great Gatsby"", the soundtrack should definitely get a nomination for the next Academy Awards.Let's talk about the actors now. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but his acting was better than I expected and is solid enough to carry the movie. Olga Kurylenko has always been an actress that I liked but she is not very impressive and rather pale in this movie. I miss a profound side and some development on her character. The secondary roles are far more convincing. Morgan Freeman is great as usual but his role is definitely too small. The biggest surprise to me was Andrea Riseborough. Her acting is charming and highly emotional. I didn't really know her before but after watching ""Oblivion"" I sure won't forget her anytime soon.What about the story now? I think that the movie takes way too much time in the beginning to introduce us into the everyday life of the two main actors. The first thirty minutes definitely have their lengths before anything intriguing happens. The plot that kicks off then has a few weird elements or even slight plot holes such as the obscure crash landing of a space shuttle but the story gets more and more vivid and intriguing. The movie has a few twists that are quite well done. They didn't really surprise me because I have seen rather similar movies in the past but they will surely surprise many people and I had no problem with a few more evident twists because they were well thought out and played as well. The story is not all too complicated to follow but keeps an intellectual touch with many aspects you may still think about a few days after you've watched this movie. This flick has indeed a slightly philosophical approach and this aspect makes the movie stand out from similar features.As a slight letdown, I thought that the ending was a little bit unspectacular after all but I wouldn't call it butchered either.In the end, we have a technically and visually impressive movie with a solid and twisted story line and an intriguingly philosophical or intellectual touch. I still think that there could have been more in this with a few more efforts put into the effects and the story itself that had its lengths but it's nevertheless among the best movies I have watched so far in this year. Science-fiction fans shouldn't expect a milestone but will discover a very entertaining and well crafted blockbuster that is worth some time and attention. I will surely watch this movie again in the years to come.",Oblivion
92,3xHCCH,The Year's First Real Contender for Oscar Consideration,9,11 April 2013,"I knew nothing about the story of ""Oblivion"" when I went in the theater, but when I came out I was completely awed by this movie. This is the first film this year that I feel is a real contender for Oscar nominee consideration. The story is intelligent without being too ""Inception""-like in its telling and development. The setting is the future after aliens have destroyed the Earth. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is a technician who fixes drones or ""Wall- E""-like flying robot police gofers of that time. He works with with his partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) and they report to a talking head on their computer named Sally (Melissa Leo). He keeps having flashbacks of going around the observation deck of the Empire State Building with a woman. One day, he rescues a female crew member of a pod that crash-landed named Julia (Olga Kurylenko), who could be connected with his past. A band of human rebels (led by Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) gives Jack an insight on his real nature. I could not divulge anymore details so as not to spoil your enjoyment of this must-see film.The technical aspects of this film were flawless. The cinematography by Claudio Miranda was breathtaking, and the director really takes time with these beautiful imagery. The art direction for this futuristic setting, from the stylish tech towers to the ruins of Manhattan, were all very well done. That transparent flying machine they use is radical in design and movement. The visual effects, so integral for science fiction films like this, were very subtle, not obtrusive at all. The atmospheric musical score was awesome, from the big orchestral sweeping ones for grandeur to those small quiet rhythmic ones for suspense.Tom Cruise does very well in this movie as the central character Jack. He does not overact this time. On the contrary, he was quite unusually reserved in his approach, underplaying, which was perfect for his character. I am not exactly thinking of an acting nomination or anything though but he is so right for the role. Freeman and the exotic Bond girl also do well in their smaller supporting roles. OK, there are some derivative scenes which may remind you of ""Star Wars"" or ""Planet of the Apes."" But more important than those observations, writer-director Joseph Kosinski really had a good story and he tells it very well indeed. He knows how to maximize the talents of his crew to create this unassuming but excellent sci-fi masterpiece. Highly recommended! .",Oblivion

The moon also was destroyed in the process. Humans are now living on Titan but have some water-based energy-producing devices on earth. Drones monitor the area to protect these devices from alien ""scavs"". A pair of humans live on earth to repair and monitor drones in a some specific area of earth. Well, they live in a house way up high over the clouds. Jack and Victoria are this team and they communicate with some mission control lady in Tet, which is some floating station. They are two weeks away from moving to Titan.Victoria, called Vika for some reason, is all about the rules, of which they are plenty. Her job is to stay at home and monitor Jack during his patrols and communicate with control. Jack patrols the wasteland, looks for downed drones, repairs them, always watching out for the scavs. But he's also curious and interested about life on earth before the war. He is nostalgic. And lives somewhat of a double life. He keeps a cabin by a lake filled with human things--books, vinyl records, and other stuff he finds during his patrols. He also has visions of life in the past and of a woman.He starts finding strange things though. One day a craft crashes. At the crash site he finds humans in a pods, but immediately drones shot the pods. Jack manages to save one pod. Inside is a woman who looks just like the woman in his visions. He takes her home and on trips. One day the scavs grab them. And from there Jack starts a journey that will challenge everything he believes in and will change everything.Oblivion is an enjoyable science fiction flick. It's stylish while some of the style is questionable. The house Jack and Vika live in is gorgeous and the views and sceneries are pretty neat. The famous bubble ship on the other hand is a bit goofy. Everything is a bubble here. Tet and the energy station looks interesting but we don't get to see much of those.Acting is alright. Freeman gets the usual Freeman role. He must be getting tired of them. Cruise is reliable as always. Olga is lovely. But I would have cast someone else as Victoria though.It's the story here that shines, although I think the director could have presented it in a more exciting way. The movie is also about 20-30 minutes too long. Oddly enough while it shouldn't be at all, toward the end it starts becoming depressing, mainly because of the music and the pace.",Oblivion
94,aharmas,Basically...,7,21 April 2013,"Science Fiction films are some of my favorite films of all time, even the ones that didn't make much sense, but that got me thinking and most importantly, moved me. I am still puzzled by the end of ""Space Odyssey"", and ""Alien/Aliens"" will always be at the top for their stories, execution, acting, and introducing those creatures... ""Prometheus"" introduced an interesting premise and promises to expand on it, and I could only wish I could say the same thing about ""Oblivion"". I have to admire its look and its basic storyline, but it failed to make me care for it or its protagonists. To be fair, I was suddenly intrigued by the Jack's confrontation with ""himself"", but in my opinion, it never picked up enough steam to succeed, and yet it is a commendable effort.In the not so far future, Earth is just a shell of itself. (I'm a bit scared by Hollywood's new development of films where we have such a bleak future). The population has been decimated by entities that are literally sucking the life out of the planet, and whoever has survived is now away in other worlds. Since the planet is a nuclear wasteland, and there are still some of the bad guys still around, it is necessary for humans to keep an eye out and eliminate them while servicing and maintaining their energy plants. Jack (Tom Cruise) is a very effective technician/sheriff, and with the help of his girl friend and team partner, they do a very ""effective"" job patrolling their area.Before we can say ""Hal"", and events start getting very confusing, Cruise is having flashbacks, encountering some strange ""things"" along the way, and he now is on a quest for the truth behind his own nature. ""Oblivion"" keeps you engaged, but it not because of its spiritual force, or for whatever empathy we might have for its characters. I couldn't stop watching the fluidity of the ""toys"" on the screen. That helicopter was something as awesome as the Nolan's Batman's transportation vehicles. They did a great job with the editing, and there is nothing wrong with the sound and visual effects, but its soul is cold, and not even Cruise's reliable man on the run routine, and Freeman's powerful vocal delivery can awaken any emotions in us.It's a fun trip into the future, with some lovely and disturbing turns. Ang Lee was capable of showing us the soul in computer animation, and how faith works in strange ways. Ironically, the God in this movie is well, not really human at all, and it shows, and it feels so distant.",Oblivion
95,peterp-450-298716,A visually stunning movie.,8,7 May 2014,"This was once again a visually stunning movie. At times I was watching it breathlessly and greatly enjoyed the apocalyptic images of the desolate landscapes and that pure piece of nature among all the chaos.Sure, you will recognize things from other films or books. But you can say about most movies that it's a faint decoction of yet another movie. Granted ! If on a yearly base there would come out a number of solid SF movies like Space Odyssey 2001, Aliens, Star Wars, The Fly, Mad Max, Prometheus ... then I would understand. But they are (as in the horror genre) terribly sparse. They could have made a dead simple put-your-brains-into-neutral movie. Well, this wasn't such a film. Or they could have made it shorter and stuffed it with a lot of fast eye-catching action. But then that would have been probably a bit to much. And so it'll never be okay for anybody.I found the portrayed view of an apocalyptic world very strong. The high-tech environment, the interiors, the buildings, vehicles and futuristic information technology looked brilliantly. And indeed, it really had an Apple feeling in all the designs. The control console they used, looked like a mega-XXL version of the iPad.The story, the final state of affairs, the twists, the explanation of how it came to this situation, unfold at a slow (sometimes too slow) way, but that's what I liked about this movie. The slow manner of telling the complete story instead of rattling off all facts in a speedy pace.I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, but to be honest, he didn't annoy me that much for once. He did what he had to do, was enjoying himself once more in a ""Mission Impossible"" kind of way and was sometimes very convincing. Andrea Riseborough did much better than in ""Welcome to the Punch"" and also acted as a cloned version. Freeman had a limited role, but was again the central character when the first surprise appeared.I have to admit , the ending felt like ""Independence Day"" and it's unbelievable that such a high-tech and sophisticated civilization couldn't have intercepted this.For the rest ... as SF fan they can dish up some more movies like this annually.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Oblivion
96,ShootingShark,"Thoughtful, Beautiful, Well-Acted, Stunningly Designed Science-Fiction Action Drama",7,23 April 2013,"In the year 2077 the world has been devastated following an extra-terrestrial invasion. Jack and Victoria are two technicians left on Earth to supervise water fuel production for colonists on Titan. All is well, but Jack is haunted by vivid dreams of a woman he can't remember and an unshakeable feeling that some great secret is being kept from him ...This spectacular, intelligent and highly original movie is a must for science-fiction fans - it's gorgeous to watch, but also beautifully played by the small cast and is a truly thought-provoking story. In an era when far too many big-budget genre films are either remakes, spinoffs or other variations on old themes, it's lovely to have a movie with plenty of new ideas. The key thing here is how to handle the what-is-really-going on question, and the scene where Jack crashes in the dunes but then sees a familiar figure in a familiar vehicle is both a fantastic twist and seamlessly takes the story from the introspective first half to the action-packed second one. More importantly however, both Cruise and Riseborough give marvellous, heartfelt and deeply affecting performances; as both their personal and professional relationships crumble into tragedy, it's the humanity (in a world devoid of humanity) which gives the movie bite. Not enough sci-fi films devote sufficient time to character development, but Kosinski doesn't make that mistake. Freeman is fun as the head of the resistance, and Leo - despite only being seen in jerky video transmissions - is wonderfully sinister, surely the first ever alien conqueror with a laid-back southern drawl. The movie also looks stunning, an incredible contrast job between smoothly high-tech and geologically blunt; the work tower in the sky and Jack's bubbleship at odds with the scarred and arid landscapes (exteriors were shot in Langjökull in Iceland and Inyo Forest in California), not to mention the coolest swimming pool in cinema. The film also sounds as good as it looks - the music by French electronic composers M83 is superb, adding the scope and depth the story needs, and Ren Klyce's sound effects are equally impressive. The drone robots are terrifying as they hurtle around, smashing everything in their path, accompanied by blasts of deep discordant noise. Based on an unpublished graphic novel by Arvid Nelson and Kosinski (whose debut feature, Tron: Legacy, is just as good), and not to be confused with the identically titled 1994 cheesy-but-fun Full Moon B-movie or the 2006 fourth game in Bethesda Softworks highly successful Elder Scrolls RPG series. This is a first-rate science-fiction film which scores on all fronts and will satisfy both die-hard genre lovers and blockbuster action fans. Top-notch.",Oblivion

I really enjoyed this one and I was quite surprised, having put it off because he was the lead. There was also something about him here that was quite sexy. A thought I haven't had about him before.I really liked the story, the effects and the production too. It starts off with similarities to 'WALL-E' and 'Elysium' on a post apocalyptic earth and moving at a good pace it keeps you interested and excited. What happened to our Planet? Will we ever return to it again? Or will Tom and Victoria re-populate the planet as Adam & Eve?
It slows towards the end, but it is a good ending.The supporting cast are all good in their roles too and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) is very good, considering she is relatively unknown. I think she deserves more work after this film.Actually I think it is the type of film 'WALL-E' should have been, the version we got from Disney being too subtle. I think kids would have reacted better to something like this.There are a lot of questions throughout to keep you guessing and drive you forward and they all seem to be answered, which is how I like my films to end.I'm not going to rush out to buy it, but I would be glad to watch it again in a couple of years.",Oblivion

In 2017 earth was attacked by an alien force that collapsed the moon causing utter cataclysmic devastation. But, that attack, even as the earth itself was being destroyed, was thwarted by use of earth's nuclear arsenal. The survivors set up a new colony in space and, while life on earth was abandoned by the survivors they depended on it for the already mentioned power source. Apparently, as is the case in almost every battle ever waged, there remains a pocket of resistance on earth – in an area capable of sustaining life, in spite of surrounding dangers of radiation, rebel resistance thrives. The new regime counts these rebels as a real enough problem to both name and hunt them. They're believed to be alien by the space colonists, an aberration these rebels use to their advantage. They give them a name to match as they're known as scavs.Jack, played by Tom Cruise, is the film's protagonist. He and a partner work for the good of the space colonizing survivors. They live in futuristic (it's 60 years post the 2017 apocalypse at least) ""home in the sky"" until which time they have finished their mission and are ultimately rewarded with every survivor's dream: life on Saturn's Titan. Jack and Victoria dutifully work as ""an effective team"" as they protect the earthly ocean water power harvesters from the Scavs. It isn't really clear if Jack and Vika (Victoria's nickname) are a romantically linked couple or just co-workers. What is clear is Vika is a ""company woman"" all the way and Jack has something wild and independent inside of him. ""The Tower"" is the control center which Jack and Vika must answer to. Specifically Jack and Vika keep uber-destructive, very deadly, ""drones"" operational. Jack actually goes to earth and repairs fallen drones, in fact Jack loves the earth for reasons slowly revealedhe has a mountain cabin in a still livable area and he has vague remembrances of things that pull him toward earth and not Saturn. Vika, on the other hand, may be human flesh, but is machine like in all other ways. Saturn, for her, is the carrot on the end of the string and she must serve to achieve it.These things set up a film that is first good entertainment. It has amazing CGI which like a painting one can't stop gazing at keeps revealing more. There is much to convey in the juxtaposition between the earth that was, the earth that is, the Scavs who remain the only resistance, and the unseen force that is exemplified by ""The Tower"" – as well as the almost painful southern drawl vocalization and scolding face symbolizing said Tower. The atmosphere is really engrossing and, like a cocoon, wraps the viewer inwardly. Think the tremendous emotional loss of humanity's beauty for a futuristic cold perfection. The cinematography here captures this much like the excellent movie Gattaca did over nearly 15 years ago. It makes one long to relive, if only in memories, the best of the human experience - Oblivion is quite effective in actually evoking this mechanism. Cruise fits the character Jack Harper well indeed. Jack may not be the company man his day job seems to indicate as something is very ""un-programmed"" in his psyche. He's very human and Cruise excels at this even in a sci-fi setting. And, without spoiling anything here's the crux of that humanity vs. cold science thing: Who really is Jack Harper? Is Jack human, and his own man, or is he a creation of science without free will? If that did not cause conflict add in Morgan Freeman's Scavs group and a strange ship crashing that has a strange tie to an earlier time as well as Jack himself. There's enough cerebral plot twists to make this a serious sci-fi yarn if not on the scale of an epic.Not to be missed is the fact this movie has what may be the best futuristic hardware seen in cinema since, well ever. That would be the ""Bubble Ship"" and ""Drones"". These two objects are a tour de force of futuristic, yet grounded in real world physics, designs. Wow! is the first thing which comes to mind, especially seeing The Bubble Ship on screen in full glory. Then, perhaps, a huge cloud of ominous darkness envelopes due to the deadly Drones – definitely scary in light of the coming moral dilemma of using drones domestically (might be a not so thinly veiled warning here). The team who designed these is clearly world class industrial designers and I want something, a car, a building or something, in the real world by this very team. They are literally amazing and that isn't an overstatement. These vehicles work here and carry more than they should (as if co-star roles) in the film due to their presence. Oblivion is highly entertaining science fiction movie making. The story of Jack Harper's world is interesting if not unique or exceptionally deep. The beauty of Oblivion is taking a lot of good things and making them better beginning with a good post-apocalyptic story, adding engaging performances, mind expanding world-class set design, jaw-dropping cinematography, and fully realized top-shelf CGI effects. Those for who this stuff speaks to won't be disappointed as they're absorbing a slice of humanity in their sci-fi.",Oblivion
100,Spondonman,Excellent escapism,7,7 September 2013,"Thankfully I saw this sci fi film without knowing much about it apart from the fact that one of the BBC's critics had dismissed it when it came out, because there's some lively plot twists right to the very end you'd be best to be er oblivious about. I'm not a Tom Cruise expert but it's the best film I've seen him in, and even though it clocks in at two hours and some think it too long I wouldn't have minded another hour.The Earth in the future is war ravaged, patrolled by robot drones and their repairmen under the control of the ultimate spy in the sky, the gargantuan spaceship Tet. Cruise plays one such repairman Jack who finds his wiped memory returning for him to question his role. And much more. The whole plot edifice is cleverly constructed and maintained, with slick and clean cgi cartoonery and graphics, supported by good performances. Although I do get fed up with pumping up the volume to compensate for pseudo-heavy guttural whisperings replacing ordinary talking - you'd think they'd all have sore throats after a days shooting. And why oh why hasn't teleportation been invented yet - it's almost as if people in the future prefer to fly enormous physical objects with innumerable moving parts, or is that just to make the game version more interesting! I see that the future still features brief(less) appearances by naked females, somethings will never change apparently. It's maybe heartwarming for oldies to surmise that the LP will survive the CD and that Led Zep will still be relevant post apocalypse but it's the plot that's more interesting after all and all I can do is recommend concentration otherwise parts of this brave new world may pass you by. I had to keep stopping and playing back to double check little things, for instance the whole section when Jack ""repaired"" Julia.There's nothing completely new here at all, just the entertaining updated cinematic way it's all been brought together from Planet Of The Apes, Silent Running, Dune, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Star Wars, Star Trek, Independence Day et al. And the end credit graphics even reminded me of the episode endings to Thunderbirds, none of these are bad things. It's the best sci fi film I've seen in years, if some of the critics don't like it just ignore them and see what you think instead.",Oblivion

It's well paced and the CG is consistently impressive. The music by M83 is also great.",Oblivion
102,davidmvining,Solid,7,28 April 2021,"I know that this started as a graphic novel by the director Joseph Kosinski, but it has the feel of a movie adapted from a short story. Instead of cramming in too many characters, we get a solid amount of time dedicated to a smaller number of them. Instead of world building bursting at the seams, we have a simple enough concept fleshed out enough for the story's purposes. This movie has room to breathe, offering a completely self-contained science fiction story that has no need for sequels. It's not perfect, but I can appreciate all of that along with the movie's simple ability to tell a straight-forward story.It's been decades since Earth was attacked by an alien force. Humanity won the war, but they lost the planet which has become a radiated wasteland. They've built water harvesters that are taking the water from the ocean and turning it into energy. Guarding these harvesters from the remnants of the alien force, the scavengers, is a pair of humans, Jack Harper and Victoria Olsen. She mans the tower, communicating with the Tet, an orbiting space station and waypoint for the last of the humans on Earth before moving on to the established colony on the Saturn moon Titan. Jack maintains the flying drones that protect the harvesters.Now, I will say that this movie starts wrong. There's an extended voiceover from Tom Cruise's Jack that explains all of that in precise detail, and it feels like something added after a test screening where some people filled out cards saying that they were confused slightly in the beginning. Better to have Cruise explain everything right up front rather than help build a sense of mystery. That explanation robs the opening of a certain sense of discovery that it would otherwise have. Maybe the voiceover was planned from the beginning, I don't know, but it's a mistake nonetheless. That most of it gets repeated, word for word, later in the film to another character, tells me that it was added in later.Anyway, aside from that voiceover, the movie begins really well. Jack has to find two downed and missing drones. He fixes the first, giving us a view of the destruction of the world, his sense of the past that he was never a part of, and the danger of the drones that nearly kill Jack as soon as the first gets resurrected. The second one is hidden in a sink hole that leads to a library. Jack goes down alone into the dark only to find that it's the drone's transponder, not the drone itself, that is hidden below, and he gets attacked by the scavengers. Saved by the drone he just fixed, Jack picks up a book (Lays of Ancient Rome by Thomas Babington Macaulay), and makes it out again, heading back home.Jack's been questioning his role in everything, why they have to abandon the planet even though they won, but Victoria just wants to follow the regulations. The source of his difference is probably that he found a refuge away from the tower. It's a green oasis in the middle of the brown devastation, hidden from radar where Jack has built a small home by a lake. Filling it with trinkets he finds in his travels, like a King Kong doll from the top of the Empire State Building that sticks out of the ground, he has a refuge from the clean lines of the tower and the dangers out in the wild. He's also haunted by visions of New York before the war, before he could have been born, and a woman he doesn't know.Everything changes when the scavengers emit a beacon from the top of the Empire State Building, bringing down a ship in orbit that crashes nearby. Jack goes to investigate, against orders from Sally in the Tet, and discovers several humans in cryo-sleep pods. Soon after he arrives, the drone arrives and starts blasting the survivors in their pods, Jack barely able to save one, filled with the woman from his visions. This is Julia, and she seems as shocked by the people in front of her as the world around her, and the reason should be easy enough to glean from anyone with a bare understanding of how stories are put together. There are particulars that probably can't be guessed, but it's obvious enough that Jack is Julia's husband in some capacity. That this is so easy to guess undermines some of the middle section because the movie, while giving up so much mystery in the beginning with its voiceover, has little mystery left and this point is so easy to figure out that there seems to be a hole. Really, that opening voiceover was a mistake.Julia ends up the source for a lot of the movie's second half reveals, but it's Morgan Freeman's Beech that offers up the most. He is a human on the planet, one that Jack thinks is a scavenger until he's captured by them, given the opportunity to destroy the Tet which goes against everything Jack has known for his entire memory, the past five years. It's when Victoria, concerned at Jack's increasingly erratic behavior and finally broken by the obvious bond between him and Julia, tells Sally that they are no longer an effective team that the Tet makes itself known to Jack, turning on him and convincing him to help.Now, there's one more piece of mystery that gets added late, and I think this is a mistake. Jack gets allowed onto the Tet by bringing Julia with the promise that they will be a more effective team. However, it turns out that Jack didn't bring Julia, he brought Beech and a bomb to blow up the Tet. We know the bomb is there, but the switch of personnel is kept a mystery from us, and I don't really see why. The point should be that Jack is lying to Sally to get in to explode the bomb, which is there, but the addition of the idea that Julia is in the sleep pod that the audience is supposed to carry on actually undermines the amount of tension in the scene. Jack wondering if he can get through with not only a bomb but the wrong person adds to that tension. Hiding that was a mistake.There's a late moment in the confrontation with Sally that I unabashedly love. Jack quotes some of the Lays of Ancient Rome to Sally, namely from Horatius' speech where he says, ""How can a man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temple of his gods."" Sally then replies, ""I created you Jack, I am your god."" That's such an awesome line, well established early by the introduction of the book and the specific lines of text and delivered wonderfully nastily by Melissa Leo as Sally's voice.The design of the movie is clean with a wonderful tower set that utilized massive projectors to create a very natural feel without any compositing in post-production. The combination of super advanced futuristic design with the grungy futuristic design of the underworld humans is well done. I wish some minor changes had been made to help enhance the film, but with each viewing I end up enjoying this more and more. This is a solid science fiction tale, well acted, well designed, and well told. It's not great, and it could have been more than it is now, but it's solidly good.",Oblivion

105,Easygoer10,"Good, But Not great",8,6 December 2018,"I don't understand why so many critics trashed this film. It was quite good, but had room for improvement. That said, for a 2nd time director (of his own film, no less), I give a lot of props to Joseph Kosinski and Tom Cruise as well for the world Kosinski created and brought it to life. Something I cannot stand is Vika's nightgown. Whoever was in charge of wardrobe made a very good suit for Jack, but Vika's nightgownl is like something from your grandmother's closet. For that matter, her dress is pretty bad as well. Regardless, it's a film I liked as much as or more than ""Elysium""(2013), but not near as much as ""Prometheus"" (2012). Ironically, some of that was filmed in Iceland also, which is where Noomi Rapace grew up (the star of ""Prometheus""), and visited family and friends while shooting there. I look forward to Kosinski's next film, as ""Brave"" (2017) is not really my cup of tea. We shall see.",Oblivion
106,Matt_Layden,If 2001 & Moon had a Hollywood love child,7,20 April 2013,"After a war with an alien species, Earth has been left in shambles. Two humans stay behind to help repair drones associated with the extraction of Earth's remaining resources. After some unusual circumstances, one of the team members begins to question his mission and purpose. The ads for this movie reveal nothing, yet reveal everything at the same time. It's an odd feeling going into this film knowing nothing about it, but knowing where most of the story will go. Near the end of the film you'll get this strange feeling that you've seen this all before. Well, you have. While Oblivion tends to borrow a lot of elements from better sci/fi films, it's enjoyable enough to keep your attention till the last scene. Oblivion is basically if 2001: A Space Odyssey and Moon had a Hollywoodized love child, which is both a positive and negative. Tom Cruise plays the hero of this story, Jack Harper. A man given the task of repairing drones that are to protect these vessels that are extracting Earth's water supply. We are told the humans had to leave Earth and are on one of Jupiter's moons. Both Cruise and Andrea Riseborough who plays his female counterpart Victoria have two weeks left of their mission before they can return to the TET. The drones are protecting the vessels from the alien species that attacked Earth. Now the story takes a few twists and turns which will have some people glued to the screen and others scratching their heads. By the end of the film all is revealed and cleared up, I for one appreciated the slow revelations of what is truth and what is fiction. Both Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko show up in the film, I don't wish to reveal their characters or purpose because the mystery is integral to the story, even if it's obvious from the get go. Freeman unfortunately is given very little to do and shows up in only 3 scenes. Kurylenko is given more, but I still wanted more of an emotional draw from her performance. Both Cruise and Riseborough do well in their respective roles. Cruise's character is more concerned with exploration and knowledge, while Riseborough is more by the book and stick to the mission. Both characters are at opposite ends of the same mission. Cruise does well here, as usual. He always gives 100 percent in his roles, which I admire. He manages to balances both the emotional weight and the action needed for this film. Joseph Kosinski is the director, who also gave us the visually stunning Tron: Legacy. Oblivion seems to be giving him more to work with from a story stand point, but the visuals are what will draw you in. Cruise is flying around a destroyed Earth with only little remnants of our history. The sequences of him in his ship are great and Kosinski knows how to handle his action sequences. The sleek design of the ship and use of white everywhere might make you think that Apple is in control in the future, but it's obvious the influences in this film are mainly Kubricks 2001 and the Rockwell mind bender Moon. Oblivion is a decent sci/fi film that makes you ask some questions, while being throughly entertained. While it's not as deep as either of the above mentioned films and feels more Hollwood, it's good enough to recommend.",Oblivion
107,pc95,"Slow, Plot OK, Settings/Future EnVisioned Well Done",6,26 May 2013,"(Spoilers) Directed by John Kosinski, ""Oblivion"" is a visually beautiful film that has some drawbacks. For me the main drawbacks, were - 1. Casting Tom Cruise. He doesn't fit the character role very well imo. 2. The pacing of the movie sometimes lagged. 3. The choice of the director to indulge too much mindless run-of-the-mill action scenes with weaponry. This may have been called for in the story, but perhaps editing/rework would've helped. Despite these issues and even a few implausibilities the movie still was interesting and engaging. Both lead female actresses Olga Kuralynko and Andrea Riseborough did well and looked fabulous on screen. I'm sure others have already compared ""Oblivion"" to the better ""Moon"", a decidedly Science Fiction movie. This story certainly grabs from it, but not in a bad way. The visuals and flying were captivating, and the narrative serviceable. Overall, admittedly I liked it more than not. It salvaged enough of a back-story to augment the visuals, although that sounds backwards. Still Give it about a 6.5/10. And must mention last, the music was pretty good too.",Oblivion

110,brando647,"Predictable and Drawn Out, but a Visual Feast",7,25 October 2013,"As far as I can tell, OBLIVION is MOON (the awesome Duncan Jones science fiction film from 2009) for people who need their sci-fi with more firefights and explosions. For anyone who hasn't seen MOON and doesn't know what I'm talking about, stop wasting time here and go watch it. It's awesome. OBLIVION is science fiction with a classic vibe and a more mainstream mentality. The premise is a combination of a handful of popular sci-fi tropes mashed together with Tom Cruise in the lead, Morgan Freeman as a mysterious figure, and a couple beautiful women for Cruise to cavort with while saving the world. It's a film loaded with beautiful imagery but a tendency to try to force a sense of grandiose complexity that it never really achieves. The movie is set in a distant future where the world has been ravaged from war against an alien species that ended with the destruction of the moon. Most of humanity has evacuated the planet for the moon of Titan in orbit of Saturn. Tom Cruise is Jack, an engineer left behind to repair aerial drones that protect salt-water harvesters from a scattering of remaining aliens intent on sabotaging the operation. Jack operates from a home perched on a Sky Tower miles above the ground with his partner/wife Vika (Andrea Riseborough) while they await the end of their contract and their chance to join the rest of the human race on Titan. As the time approaches, complications arise when an escape pod crash-lands on Earth carrying a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and a powerful secret to reveal about Jack's existence.Probably the first thing anyone will notice about OBLIVION is that it looks amazing. No matter what negative opinions people might offer about the movie, no one can complain that it looks shoddy. Everything here looks fantastic. The landscape is far-reaching and barren with occasional artifacts rising up from the desert to signify the society that once thrived there, whether it be a grounded ocean freighter or a surviving piece of New York's iconic skyline. The home sitting at the top of the Sky Tower is a pseudo-futuristic style where everything is spotless and streamlined. There are windows on every side of the home to provide an awesome 360-degree view. I love the design of the drones and I especially love the fact that they were shot practically when the filmmakers were able to give them a sense of realism. There is a fantastic shot about halfway through the movie or so with a drone slowly hovering through a shattered window, pushing through flaming curtains for a sinister reveal. Fantastic stuff. And then there's the bubble ship. The bubble ship is an atmospheric flyer and primary form of transport for Jack, with a gyroscopic bubble cockpit allowing for some pretty wicked flight shots. Visually, this movie is a perfect 10 but there's still the little matter of the plot and such. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but it just doesn't live up to the quality of the film's style.Anyone who's seen their share of science fiction will see right through this film from the start. There's a major reveal a little more than halfway through the film that I won't reveal here for anyone who hasn't watched it yet, but I'm going to admit that I saw most of it coming within the first ten minutes of the film. Jack and Vika report each day to their mission control, based out of an orbital station known as the Tet. The Tet issues their daily assignments and provides support for their mission (the water harvesters). From the first video conversation between Vika and Sally (Melissa Leo, their contact aboard the Tet), I had this movie pegged and knew what to expect. This isn't to say the plot is weak or the twist is stupid. Actually, I think it's pretty entertaining. I've just seen enough movies of this nature to know where they were going with it. There were a few surprises in there that I wasn't able to see coming. The movie is well done. It's just very familiar. The cast is mostly superb. I'm probably one of Tom Cruise's few real film fans left, it seems. I'll agree that he has a tendency to do a lot of the same in each of his movies and he doesn't always disappear into his character, but he does well and he's a fine action star for his age. I thought he was great in OBLIVION. Andrea Riseborough and Morgan Freeman do a great job as well (though you don't really expect any less from Freemanthe dude's awesome). Olga Kurylenko is fine, though she doesn't seem to have a whole lot to work with here. I'm not entirely sure what I feel about Kurylenko as an actress. She's definitely gorgeous but she's never really turned in a performance that stood out to me. Here, she's fine.For people that need more 'splosions with their sci-fi, OBLIVION delivers. It's a more mainstream science fiction film that incorporates plenty of action to keep audiences riveted between drawn-out, plot-driven scenes. If OBLIVION has one major flaw, it'd be that it drones on a little longer than necessary. It feels as if director Joseph Kosinski is trying to emphasize an epic scale that the movie hasn't earned when he would've been a better off tightening it down a bit. So, OBLIVION in a nutshell: predictable and drawn out, but visually amazing with an effective cast.",Oblivion

113,moviexclusive,"Not a classic by any measure, this intriguing yet familiar thriller still packs suspense and excitement for a satisfying sci-fi outing",7,11 April 2013,"So much for its ambition of being a ground-breaking science-fiction thriller – like the first of many twists that you will no doubt see coming, 'Oblivion' is a clone of other far superior genre classics, e.g. the little-seen but highly acclaimed 'Moon'. Indeed, much excitement has been swirling around its plot details, fuelled no doubt by its long-gestating genesis, but this passion project from 'Tron: Legacy' director Joseph Kosinski isn't particularly smart or original to satisfy those heated expectations.Narrated by Tom Cruise's lead character, a Commander Jack Harper, the story is set sixty years later after a heated war between mankind and aliens has decimated much of the Earth as we know it. Its inhabitants evacuated to one of Saturn's moons, Jack is apparently but one of the few remaining humans, a 'Techie' whose mission is to maintain the drones that are protecting the machines extracting the Earth's remaining resources. Jack's luckier though than most other equivalent sci-fi characters; he's got a female companion Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), who is also his Comms officer maintaining contact with Mission Control – aka Sally (Melissa Leo) – and watching his back while he is out on his runs.The opening prologue establishes not only the cataclysmic backdrop but also Jack's inner state of mind, haunted by visions of a distant yet familiar past of him on a busy New York City street and on the viewing deck of the Empire State Building before the Earth's devastation. Reality though is far more sombre, as Jack senses the imminence of some larger danger looming with a sudden spike in the number of crippled drones that have their nuclear fuel cells subsequently removed. That's supposedly the nefarious work of what's left of the warring alien race, referred to as the Scavengers, which prowl the wastelands to destroy any trace of human civilisation.Anyone with a reasonable amount of doubt will certainly guess that there is more than meets the eye, but Jack only realises that when a rogue signal brings a space shuttle crashing onto the surface of the Earth. Not only does the craft called the Odyssey carry with it some human astronauts in deep sleep, one of them whom Jack risks his life to protect is the girl he glimpses in his dreams, a certain Julia Rusakova (Olga Kurylenko). Truth comes knocking when he escorts Julia to return to the crash site to retrieve the flight recorder but is instead captured by an insurgency led by the enigmatic Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), who urges him to look beyond the obvious.Fortunately for him – and perhaps less so for those of us hoping for some deeper revelation – Jack needn't think too hard. No prizes for guessing what sort of resistance Malcolm and the rest of his guerrilla army are fighting, or who Julia was to Jack in his previous life, or even the very nature of Jack's being; even though Kosinki and his writers – Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt – try their darnest to keep their cards close to their chest, the deck that they hold isn't that surprising or outstanding after all. Peripheral details aside, this is essentially the story of one man who thinks he is fighting on the right side of justice, learns that the world that he used to know was a lie, and then decides to switch sides to fight for the resistance. Wait, wasn't that basically the story of 'The Matrix' as well? Once you accept that this isn't going to be some masterpiece, you'll come to better appreciate Kosinski's treatment. Just as he amply demonstrated with his feature film debut, Kosinski's strength lies in his ability to transport his audience into a richly imagined world full of stunning detail. There is something truly astounding and even humbling about the post-apocalyptic landscapes against which the movie is based - from half-standing baseball stadiums to the ruins of the Empire State Building to the pockets of lush untouched greenery – that Kosinski uses in a particularly evocative manner, such that every frame is always visually and emotionally engrossing to suit the mood of the scene.More significantly, Kosinski has greatly matured as a filmmaker since his first outing. No doubt assisted with a much stronger script than 'Tron: Legacy', Kosinski displays a newfound dexterity in his storytelling, keeping a brisk and engaging pace throughout the movie through a good balance of larger action-packed sequences and quieter intimate moments. At least we can reassure you that if you thought that 'Tron: Legacy' was more style than substance, there is a lot more substance here to match Kosinski's distinctive visual style.And then of course there is Hollywood's leading man Tom Cruise, who plays a variant of his stoic loner-type characters. Cruise goes for a more subtle performance this time round that fits in nicely with the restrained tone of the film. Although he gets to share more screen time with two beautiful ladies, Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough, it is his scenes with Morgan Freeman that possess the most zing - pity then that there are too few of those in a film that uses Freeman in no more than an extended cameo.Certainly, that doesn't feel like the only missed opportunity in a movie whose hype threatens to be its Achilles' heel. More derivative of other seminal sci-fi classics than you would expect it to, 'Oblivion' will disappoint those looking for a genre-defining masterpiece. Instead, what it boasts is a filmmaker well in tune with the sensibilities of the genre, who has taken some of its signature elements and recycled them into something intriguing yet ultimately familiar, and whose eye for detail and spectacle is rather amazing to say the least. It is visually stunning no doubt, and packed with enough intrigue and excitement to make for a captivating leap into a dystopic future.",Oblivion
114,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Oblivion""- Decent entertainment but overlong, generic, simplistic and often derivative of other (better) films. Alright popcorn adventure, but far from anything special.",7,2 February 2014,"Tom Cruise stars as what more-or-less amounts to a glorified repair man in ""Oblivion"", a Sci-Fi adventure from director Joseph Kosinski, who was responsible for Disney's long-awaited ""Tron: Legacy."" Yes, instead of being a dashing pilot, or an adventurer, action-hero Cruise is little more than the guy who comes in to fix your pipes while accidentally exposing the top of his rear-end due to slightly saggy pants. (Although to the character's credit, he repairs advanced technology- mainly drones.)I don't know why, but the idea that Cruise is a repair-guy just sort of tickled my humorous side. Especially considering he's the most ripped, buff and ""action hero""-y repair man I've ever seen... but I digress.The film focuses on Cruise's character, Jack Harper, one of the few remaining human's colonizing Earth after a horrible battle with vile aliens known as ""Scavangers"" or ""Scavs"", which forced other survivors to flee the planet. Living with his partner (and lover) Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough), Harper oversees the maintenance of heavily armed drones, which patrol the surface in order to protect hydro-plants used for the generation of fusion energy from the remaining Scavs living on the surface. However, after discovering another surviving human named Sally (Melissa Leo), and learning more about the true nature of the Scavs, Harper is forced into a fight for survival that will leave him questioning which side he should be fighting for.The acting is actually very solid. Cruise as always proves to be a fun and charismatic lead, and despite picking on his profession above, he makes for a very solid performance, and is compelling and likable. Riseborough is also quite good in her role (and quite stunning I may add), although she doesn't have too much to do within the narrative, which was unfortunately a bit of a letdown, especially given some of the twists and turns that I will not spoil. Leo is decent in her role, and she has a lot more to do than Riseborough, although I honestly felt that both Cruise and Riseborough overshadowed her. Something about her just wasn't quite as compelling. And other supporting roles (the names of who I won't mention due to spoilers) are generally quite well-played.The direction is also very good. Kosinski is a very capable visual storyteller, and his work here is very slick, concise and stylish. I really appreciated that unlike virtually every other director working today, he doesn't over-use ""shaky-cam"" or rely on crafting a dark, gritty work. He's perfectly happy with still shots and sweeping photography, which felt like a breath of fresh air compared to most other modern Hollywood films. I'm sorry, but I wish shaky-cam and grit would just sort of go away for a while. It works sometimes, but Hollywood is just too obsessed with it.The rest of the production is also quite nice. While the costume and set design is a bit generic (for example, the Scav's suits look almost identical to predators from the movie... um... ""Predator""), it's all of a very high quality. And the visual effects were quite nice, and didn't take me out of the story as they do in other films.However, the problem here is not the production, cast or direction. The issue is the script by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn, based on an unpublished comic by director Joseph Kosinski. It's just not very good. It's about 15 minutes too long, quite generic, overly simplistic and often derivative of many other (much better) Sci-Fi adventure films. It's not all that compelling a story either, nor is it particularly original. And it was loaded with a lot of sequences that felt like unneeded filler. Many people have commented that the film seems to contain countless tropes and ideas from Sci-Fi film history, which I agree with, and believe it cheapens the story to an extent. Unfortunately, while the rest of the film is actually very good, the script is just mediocre to the point it drags the entire thing down a few points.Which is a shame.I think this had potential. With another re-write or two, it could've even potentially become a modern Sci-Fi masterpiece. But with the script that they used, I unfortunately can't give this film anything more than a pretty- good 7 out of 10.I think this film is still definitely worth giving a shot, and a lot of people will find it fun and entertaining... but don't expect much thought or heart to be there. Because it isn't there.",Oblivion
115,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Sure, just a big-budget Moon, but also a beautifully shot blockbuster.",7,15 August 2013,"I skipped Tron: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski's only other film, as it looked like sensory overload to the extreme. Fortunately, Oblivion is just the right amount. The most striking thing about the film is its beautiful cinematography for such a big blockbuster. Its assortment of muted greys and beiges never get tiring. It presents such a shockingly huge and convincing scale that it's difficult to not spend the whole film marvelling at the scope, especially for a film with such few characters. The sound design and score are built to match too. It's a slow and moody film that often takes itself a little too seriously, but that perfectly suits Tom Cruise. While underdeveloped side characters and cliché conflicts left me cold, the heart of the film is Cruise's protagonist. His dreams and drive keep the film compelling even though he puts his 'everyman' cap on regardless of the context, he makes it work. I don't think Oblivion should be singled out for its lack of originality since in contemporary sci-fi, isn't everything borrowed from the classic archetypes? Oblivion can often be confusing when its mysteries don't make sense and when they're revealed, it does feel like just a big budget Moon but otherwise its execution is perfectly fine for what it is. A pleasant surprise.7/10",Oblivion
116,zhyarTheChosen,Really,4,2 October 2019,One of the worst movie ever I just wasted 2 freaking hours,Oblivion
117,tomsview,From the obvious to the oblivious,6,7 October 2013,"""Oblivion"" starts out with scope and size but shrinks through trite dialogue, too many drone battles and an actor who could have given it depth, but instead played it at his most superficial level.Tom Cruise performs this one in the hyperactive manner that was fine at the beginning of his career, but is wearing a bit thin now that he has hit the 50 mark. Warning bells sound early in ""Oblivion"" when his character talks to the head-nodding dashboard figurine in his spacecraft. By the time he makes the imaginary long shot to replicate an old Super Bowl game followed by the touchdown, you know this movie isn't the new ""2001"".The biggest problem is the script, and as it is partly by Joseph Kosinski, who not only directed the film, but also created the graphic novel on which it was based, I guess there just weren't enough people around to say, ""Hey man, this isn't working"". Moreover, did we really need all the repetitious, video game-like battles with the drones – even after one battle you can feel your brain starting to slide into, yesoblivion.The concept behind the movie is intriguing, and the special effects are simply ravishing – just about the cleanest and best in any sci-fi movie. The story is seen from the point of view of Commander Jack Harper, Tom Cruise's character, who narrates the story and informs us how although humans were victorious after an invasion of Earth by the alien Scavs, the planet was so devastated that mankind was forced to relocate to Saturn's moon, Titan.Jack and his teammate, Vika Olsen, played by Andrea Riseborough, man a space station above Earth in order to maintain the drones that send the planet's remaining resources to the Tet, the huge space station above Earth that is readying the human population for the journey to Titan.When Jack discovers a female survivor, Julia Rusakova, played by Olga Kurylenko, and encounters the Scavs, who turn out to be human, he learns that he has been the victim of a huge deception; the real aliens have used him to help take Earth's resources for themselves. There's a lot more to the plot with mind-washing and cloning playing a big part in the story. However, ""Oblivion"" is undermined by superficialities in the script, which jumps from high-minded concepts to dialogue so juvenile that it must surprise everyone in the audience including juveniles.As Malcolm Beech, the leader of the resistance on Earth, this is the sort of performance that Morgan Freeman just about phones in. Although he explains much of the background of the story, the fantastic voice is also asked to deliver lines such as, ""That is one p***ed off weapon"". Better luck next movie Morgan.Even when appealing to a young audience, surely it isn't necessary to dumb your movie down with anachronistic jargon and out of place references to today's teen lifestyle in the belief that they won't get it otherwise? As any parent who has ever dealt with a teenage son or daughter knows, exasperatingly, they can deal with complex argument on many levels. Audiences these days understand the language of film, they can handle obscure and non-linear concepts, but they will always react to the jarring note, and ""Oblivion"", despite the dazzling visuals, has more than a few jarring notes.",Oblivion
118,OJT,"A little bit of everything, I realized I loved it",10,12 April 2013,"Watching this at the world premiere in my little hometown, not knowing anything about it except it receiving av 5 of 6 stars from my favorite film critics newspaper, I knew I was in for a treat as a sci-fi lover.Not perfect in th beginning, but slowly getting interesting. Still, as the film grew on me I realized I enjoyed the ride immensely. It's not perfect in a 100 percent way, but it's got what I love in a good sci-fi movie. I was transfered back to my classic sci-fi experiences at cinema, feeling some of the same as when I saw Blade Runner (1982), Gattaca (1997), The Fifth Element (1997), Matrix (1999) and A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001).The thing about Oblivion is that it has something of everything. A lot of homages to other sci-fi movies are among them, but it's got action, sentimentality, beauty, intrigue, unexpectedness, humor, love, memories and mystery. Put in a dash of loneliness, environmental issues as well as all the hidden gems of you to discover in the rubble, then you've got a classic. I could go on, but with Morgan Freeman, Nicolaj Coaster Waldau and Tom Cruise on the team, this was a gem.This is what a sci-fi movie is all about. Stealing your imagination, making it hard to understand sometime, but then it all comes down to poetry, love and soulfulness. I realize most of the sci-fi movies I loved has had many of the same elements. Oblivion is a mix of A.I., Wall-E, Star Wars, I am Legend, Star Trek and another kind of benchmark in the genre if you ask me!And there's more than enough room for a sequel as well, in more than one way. In the end I even saw Ron L. Hubbards signs of an God-all-seeing eye which can be interpreted into almost what you want either good or bad, but most certainly something Tom Cruise could by into. Hilarious! Especially if you think him as the one bombing the whole system to pieces.Go see it, and enjoy! It's understandable that you'll forget the popcorn eating during watching it. You're still happy when you go! OK, it's cheesy, glossy and dirty as well, but saving the planet is a dirty business!",Oblivion
119,DJAkin,Tom Cruise strikes gold yet again,10,20 April 2013,"When I went to this movie, I was not too sure what to expect. I know that Morgan Freeman is one of the actors and a supporter of Obama. And Jake says Tom Cruise is a supporter of Obama as well. But I decided to leave my voting card at the door and enjoy the movie (which I did).This movie had it all! I starts off with some great visuals of what Earth looks like after an alien invasion. There is a lot of neat stuff like the top of the Empire State Building and you can even make out some other landmarks. Tom Cruise steals the show as Jack Harper. He is part of the mop up crew. There are these scary little ""drones"" throughout the movie also. They look like mean Pac Man characters and they fly and shoot. The flying scenes with Tom Cruise are just amazing. I could not hope but notice a nod to George Lucas with the chase scene in the canyons. I wonder if that was intentional? Anyway, I also liked how this movie paid homage to the one and only Matrix. That scene where they are in the space ship and see tens of thousands of Tom Cruise's being ""made"" in capsules of water was just amazing!Of course there was the obligatory shirtless scenes with Tom Cruise. For 50, he sure has a good physique! But then again, he trains all the time. I liked that chase scene where he was running. I like the way he always runs like his arms are made out of dolphin fins. I call that move the ""Tom Cruise Run"".Will this be an Oscar winner? Perhaps for visual effects. This movie was a true visual treat and a pleasure for my eyes to watch. Kudos for the director for making sure this movie had all of the ELEMENTS of a good sci fi movie: 1. A time setting in the future, in alternative timelines. 2. A spatial setting or scenes in outer space and 3. Characters that include aliens, mutants, androids, or humanoid robots! (drones). This movie also had the main elements of a good movie which is a beginning, middle and and end.Contrats Tom Cruise! Keep these good movies coming!",Oblivion
120,Troy_Campbell,"Not brilliant, but moving and exciting nevertheless.",7,12 April 2013,"It's been my experience that when someone says ""I hate Tom Cruise movies"" it's because they read too many trashy mags and have formed a negative opinion of the man himself; which invariably leads to a blind dislike of his output, regardless if its good, bad or somewhere in between. Well, Oblivion is the latest motion picture from Cruise - after the admittedly superior Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol - that many will unfortunately deny themselves the joy of viewing. It's not the world-beating sci-fi epic it so desperately aims to be (there's obvious nods to 2001, The Omega Man and even Total Recall), but that doesn't stop this futuristic tale from being thought-provoking, visually beautiful and largely entertaining. A sagging middle period slows proceedings down after the opening act so capably sets the tone, yet a rousing and surprisingly affecting climax ensures it finishes on a very strong note. The Cruiser is solid as curious drone maintenance man Jack Harper, so too Olga Kurylenko as a mysterious human whose space-pod crash lands onto the dilapidated Earth and Andrea Riseborough as Jack's straight-as-an-arrow co-worker and lover; it's Morgan Freeman who lets the side down in a clichéd and predictable role as leader of the underground resistance. The film's greatest asset though? The superb techno score that, coupled with Daft Punk's phenomenal musical work on Tron: Legacy, proves director Joseph Kosinksi knows how important a memorable beat is in these visionary worlds of his. Moments of brilliance outshine the sporadic flaws to establish this as a moving, exciting and worthy sci-fi yarn.",Oblivion
121,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A decent popcorn flick not intended for thought-provoking movie buffs.,6,5 June 2013,"Oblivion is a pretty flawed film but it does have some nice visuals. It was filmed with 2D digital film cameras, so that saves the audience from having to suffer another poorly done 3D experience. Regardless of the film looking rather nice, the story is a bit cluttered and has a tone of logic problems. There's something regarding Tom Cruise's character and his boss named Sally, and memories/dreams that Cruise keeps having that are explained as the movie progresses. I refuse to spoil the plot because I like as many people as possible reading these reviews to be free of ruining the film for them.Let me start with the pros of Oblivion; the world of Oblivion is unique somewhat, yet sterile. The war torn land of planet Earth is absolutely dirty, but Cruise's base in the sky is an Apple-level of silky smooth and perfect technology. It's like the Star Wars prequels production designer teamed up with the production designers of The Terminator franchise to make this depressing land have a subtle technological beauty to it.The action sequences are also pretty good. There are a lot of high-octane scenes, from chase scenes to scenes where Tom Cruise isn't fully prepared for a battle. Morgan Freeman was a good choice for the mysterious ""head-of-a-post-apocalyptic-resistance"" character, akin to Morpheus.Now time for the cons; the pacing had the same pacing issues in Tron: Legacy, Joseph Kosinski's first directorial effort. The pacing was slowed down not so much by the editing but the character's pacing of development and their dialogue. The dialogue came out at times as just being awkwardly written or were said in ways that some socially awkward kid would try to start a conversation with. The music wasn't all that memorable but it was okay from what I remember of it.While Oblivion isn't a reboot or remake or re-imagining of any science fiction movies or books, it borrows a tone of ideas and visuals from classic science fiction. However some of these were intensionally done, like the subtle Planet of the Apes reference (I'm not saying), The Matrix, some references to Star Wars (obviously), and even lesser science fiction properties like the Aeon Flux movie (don't worry; the reference was only a coincidence that I just noticed. Hell, the similarity is done A LOT better here).The film is recycled from other movies but introduces audience newcomers to science fiction (if there are any real newcomers at all) and reintroduces the themes of the films it payed homage to, so they can be passed on to a new generation of movie buffs.Not great, simply good, entertaining stuff that you can kill some time with. I give Oblivion 6/10.",Oblivion
122,gianmarcoronconi,Good,8,13 September 2021,This film is completely based on a unique plot twist done divinely but based on that alone you can't fully enjoy the film in the end because the rest is not done as well as that thing there.,Oblivion
123,inspectors71,"So the title is a joke, right?",5,6 April 2016,"Joseph Kosinski's Oblivion (2013) is visually beautiful and almost totally pointless. It's obvious that the story is, thin as it is, a way to blow a lot of CGI dollars and beautiful scenery and give Tom Cruise a chance to show off his manly-man physique. Since I'm not interested in Cruise's musculations, the female leads are equally forgettable (I'm not even motivated to look up their names), and Morgan Freeman is totally wasted, I'm left with remembering bits of scenery, landscapes, colors, textures, and that really cool helicopter-spaceship that Cruise cruises around in, with a bobble- head on the dashboard to make him seem, well, whatever. Not so bland, I guess, or cutesy-human-one-foot-in-our-time.I think the biggest trouble with Oblivion is that fairly early on, we find out something about the aliens, the ""Scavs,"" that sucks out all the air from the movie's environment suit. The viewer says, ""Well, hell . . . ""Then when we're supposed to get up in arms over the real baddies, the needle on the giveacrapometer won't budge.So, for the next hour or seven, we're stuck in . . . wait for it . . .waaaiiit . . .

124,Jeremy_Urquhart,A solid and visually pretty sci-fi film,7,20 April 2020,"You know, I'm going to cut right to the chase and admit that I find it somewhat hard to find myself compelled to talk about a movie that I don't have a strong opinion on- when I write a review, I like it to be on a movie that I either really really like or really really dislike. I just find it easier and more enjoyable to talk about a movie that I feel strongly about. So in all honesty, I'm finding it a little difficult to muster up enthusiasm to discuss the latest Tom Cruise film Oblivion. I saw it last night, and honestly, it was pretty good, but not great- hence why I feel a little reluctant to talk about it. The fact that the movie has so many twists and turns also makes me feel a little hesitant to review the film, so I'll keep this one kind of brief, and refrain from giving away any plot details.All you really need to know going into this film is that its science fiction and Tom Cruise is the star- the plot is so full of twists (some impressive and some kind of ""meh"") that it's probably in your best interest to go into the film free of any spoilers, be them major or minor in nature (remember kids: ""spoilers absolutely suck""). And besides, the plot is spelt out for you so literally thanks to a five minute opening narration from Cruise's character that you don't really need any context going into this.I have to say though that this led to a kind of underwhelming beginning, as his narration goes on for a long time and causes little to be left to the imagination, at least for the first portion of the film. The voiceover is a cinematic technique that I've never really made up my mind on; sometimes it can work really well (see Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece Sunset Boulevard), yet sometimes it feels awkward and unnecessary (see the infamous theatrical cut of Blade Runner, with a disgruntled and bored-sounding Harrison Ford). The voiceover in Oblivion isn't a prevalent force throughout the entire film, but it does overstay its welcome in the film's prologue. I found myself wishing that the film had found a slightly more subtle and natural way to introduce us to the film's world and its characters.Thankfully though this voiceover (which I keep rambling on about for some reason) is accompanied by some absolutely stunning imagery, which, unlike the voiceover (there I go again) is a constant presence in the film. Seriously, this film is absolutely gorgeous, and without any gimmicky, blurry, distracting 3D effects, it is, simply put, a joy to look at. Everything is so smooth, white, and so very very shiny, and though the film takes place on a desolate and destroyed Earth, it's still just so staggeringly beautiful. This is perhaps one of the most visually awe-inspiring films I've seen for a while. The look of this film, along with the soundtrack by M83, are the two main elements of the film that are receiving near unanimous praise, and deservedly so, in my opinion.Other elements of the film have proven more divisive. While I'm all for unpredictability in narratives, and therefore I'm a pretty decent fan of the odd plot twist here and there, Oblivion has a lot of them- maybe too much, to the point where every-time a new big reveal was made I almost felt like rolling my eyes and saying ""really, another one?"" And I also have to mention that while the twists are for the most part fairly well-executed, and often unexpected, a number of them have been damn near ripped off from other science fiction films. Of course I can't say which twists they are, and where they've been borrowed from, as I'd rather not spoil any movie in this review, but at least a few of the twists have been seen in other pieces of science fiction, which honestly hurts the film as it makes the twists in Oblivion feel less exciting and surprising, because they're twists that some of us may have already witnessed in other, earlier works of science fiction.Tom Cruise probably deserves a mention though- he gives a good performance and really does help carry the film. The supporting cast is good, but none of the other characters are given as much screen time as everybody's favourite scientologist. It's not a one-man show for Cruise by any means, but he is undoubtedly the film's star.I've never been the hugest fan of Cruise, but I fully respect and understand why he is so immensely popular, and has been for so long. I tend to enjoy his performances, but I do think he often has a tendency to over-act and this makes his performances sometimes a little hard to take seriously (the yelling scene from Born on the Fourth of July anyone? Or how about his wheelchair fight with Willem Defoe from the same film?) Maybe this is why one of his most deliberately goofy performances of his career also happens to be one of my personal favourites of his- I'm talking about his small yet so very memorable role in Tropic Thunder.And there's his infamous antics outside of his films that are so highly publicised and talked about that it makes Tom Cruise the actor hard to separate from Tom Cruise's characters- the man is so well-known and so frequently discussed that it makes it impossible to watch a Tom Cruise performance without being aware that you are indeed watching Tom Cruise.But hey, he's still around, and he's still dedicating himself to most of the roles he takes, so he does deserve respect. And his reliability in Hollywood is undeniable- it's amazing that he has been such a reliable actor for so long considering how unstable celebrity gossip sites and tabloid papers will tell you he is.Anyway, that's about all I want to say about Oblivion. I'm sorry I didn't really go into depth with this review, but it really is best to go into this film without knowing too much about it at all. It is a good film, but it's probably not going to stick with you like the best science fiction films often do. It's a good time at the movies though for sure, and if you just want to go and watch something visually spectacular, then this is the movie for you. The soundtrack, acting, and direction are all solid, and I really can't say I ever felt all that bored during it's 126 minute running time.Still, it never achieves greatness. An over-reliance on twists, some that may prove familiar to some members of the audience, a forced and overly-long opening narration and some less than stellar character development harm this film in the narrative department, but it's definitely not a waste of time. I recommend Oblivion, but I'd advise audiences to enter the film with moderate expectations- a new science-fiction classic this is not.3 and a half out of 5 stars, 7/10, B, etc...",Oblivion

126,one9eighty,A fairly forgettable end of the world scenario,6,11 April 2016,"A 2013 film by Neil Blomkamp featuring a future, post apocalyptic Earth and a defeated humanity. Planet Earth was attacked by Aliens and a war ensued. In order to win the war, humans had to lose the planet. They waged was with the aliens, launching nuclear warheads thus leaving Earth ravaged with radiation. The Plan B for humanity is the moon of Titan, humans have been shepherded off to survive there. Those who aren't already there are on a massive space ship just outside of Earth's atmosphere waiting to be taken. There is hardly any trace of human beings left on the planet. Two people that are still there are Jack and Victoria (Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough). They are maintaining drones and robotic equipment meant to take the last of the resources on Earth in order to allow humanity on Titan to prosper. They do their jobs and don't ask questions - they are an effective team. By night Jack is haunted by visions in his dreams but by day he risks life and limb maintaining equipment and dealing with scavengers, the left over aliens who have no hope of leaving Earth again. One day a human spaceship, the Odyssey, crash lands on earth, beckoned by a signal that the scavengers have set up in an old communications tower. This event changes everything and Jack soon starts thinking that not everything is as it seems and how he's been told. This was an enjoyable film albeit not that complex and surprising, I was able to guess the outcome and ending before it unfolded on screen. The cast are authentic but not that deep or complex, the most complex part of the make up was Jack's random dreams which sell the way the film is going. I haven't seen Andrea Riseborough in anything else and she was authentic and refreshing, the same applies for Olga Kurylenko (Julia). Morgan Freeman (Beech) plays the same character he usually does, intelligent but smart-mouthed. It's nice to see Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Sykes) not covered in dirt and blood (a-la Game of Thrones) but he comes across as bland and forgettable which was a pity. The film is all very straightforward and there is no disruption to the narrative or anybody who wants to question the situation. Even when uncovering the truth it's all very straight forward, nobody argues and they just accept what is being said. The big twist in the film is obvious and shouldn't surprise anyone. The saving grace for this film is backdrop and scenery, it shows Earth beauty despite some radiation ravaged landscapes. It reminded me a little of the kind of environment you'd expect to find in the game ""Fallout 3"", the only things missing where the mutants and rad-scorpions. Despite being a big budget Hollywood film this felt almost second class and it isn't a film I'll remember in a few weeks time. The CGI was finely executed and the set was top notch and imaginative but with very little in the way of plot and story the film was never going to leave an everlasting mark on film history. This is one of the more light hearted post apocalypse films I have seen in recent years. A lot of style over substance I'm going to give this 6 out of 10 - not the worst film but definitely not living up to the potential it had.",Oblivion
127,PartialMovieViewer,Mediocre Would Be Too Generous,2,19 December 2013,"Far from Tom Cruise's best – and I am a pretty big Tom Cruise fan. ""Oblivion"", had a very good beginning – always like good shoot-em-ups, but it really tanked when the plot got all twisted around itself and strangled all logic. And Morgan Freeman – why was he in this anyway? What a pointless and wasted part. If they had worked a little more on his character development – it may have saved the movie. Nahjust kidding – there is no saving this flick. This re-hash of the same old story of the bad guys are really the good guys and the good guys are the bad guys (Total Recall comes to mind), has been done so many times before – it ended up being a bore. The cast was great – but the writing - sheesh? This was something with good possibilities that ended up with a juvenile plot, that unravels to the point where some convoluted ending had be tossed in. Don't get me wrong – it is not all hogwash. If one enjoys action scenes and pretty scenery and you are not really into a storyline, then this is for you. And I can understand where the very young would probably eat this kind of fantasy up with their morning flakes - well yippee for them. Oh and those youngsters may even think something like, ""Wow-wee – this is really good Sci-Fi."" It isn't. I feel this is mediocre Sci-Fi, with an excellent cast.

There's a forced, tacked on Hollywood ending that causes you to question where did that kid come from? Don't question too much as the movie makes up the rules as it goes along.If you are considering seeing this, see it in a theater. It looks good on the big screen and will loose much of it's impact on other platforms.",Oblivion
130,natashabowiepinky,Just what is going on?!,6,13 April 2014,"Oblivion is another one of those films which, judging by the disconcerting introduction, you just KNOW will contain a twist. You'll spend the rest of the duration figuring it out... trying to pick up various clues here and there... but will you do it? Chances are... no. Yes, there are a few signposts along the way to point you in the right direction, but most of it only makes sense in hindsight. This is good, as the events of the latter half will come as a shock to most viewers... and isn't that why we watch movies in the first place... to be enthralled and thrilled? Getting there, though can be a bit of an uphill struggle at times... as the plot meanders when it should be racing ahead. Tom Cruise is his usual self... he was possibly born for everyman hero roles such as this. And Andrea Riseborough makes an impression as his sexy assistant. But the quieter moments feel a little corny, and the action scenes, while impressive, tend to get repetitive. After all, there's only so many ways you can blast flying droids...So, while it may lack the intelligence and heart to be compared with the very best of the influx of sci-fi mysteries we've been experiencing of late, it's still worth a watch. And credit Cruise with being 50 but looking like a man a full decade younger. Bet my dad's dead jealous... 6/10",Oblivion
131,agmoldham,Pretty Bland,5,30 April 2013,"When Tom Cruise was at the height of his career he seemed to alternate between playing a blockbuster (eg. Top Gun, Jerry Maguire) role and playing a serious (eg. Magnolia, Rain Man) role. He seems to be somewhat out of fashion these days and he probably has much less choice over the films that he does. Oblivion is a paint by numbers sci-fi movie. It isn't terrible, but there's very little in the script that you will not have seen in other movies. Cruise plays Jack who is one of the few remaining drone operators who are left on earth. The rest of the population have left earth behind and gone to live on Titan. This followed a war with Aliens over earths resources which we eventually won, but at the cost of the planet.The supporting cast includes a couple of scenes with Morgan Freeman which aren't very convincing. Some of the effects are quite good and liked the performance of Olga Kurylenko as Jack's sidekick. By no means the worst film I've ever seen, but not that memorable.",Oblivion

133,abisio,A new low for Tom Cruise,4,19 April 2013,"I did not have great expectations with OBLIVION. TRON 2 was really a piece of crap with nice FX. Sadly I was not wrong; but the effects are better.I really liked Tom when he was a human person with defects and qualities (RISKY BUSINESS, TOP GUN, COCKTAIL, JERRY MACGUIRE; even the first MI ). In his new face as action hero; Tom became just PERFECT. He is always the nicest, the strongest, the smartest and all the ...est you can find. That could work for a while but after so many movies it just became a repetition of exactly the same. If you do not believe me see back to back OBLIVION and JACK REACHER.Here his acting is basically a repetition of his sad, fierce, tender, loving and surprised face. It is a pity he gave up on Oscar's glory; he should have done that with the action hero mode.The story is a mixture of the shallow elements of MOON, 2001 and a couple of Bradbury tales (in fact I am pretty sure Martian Chronicles includes a very similar tale); but because of the high budget it never becomes existentialist but violent in the third act. The problem is that the few action scenes are not really interesting. The shutdown with the drones has some dramatic effect but even GI JOE II gets better battles.The worst part is the epilogue; SPOILER begins After an heroic act; he cannot stay dead; he has to be resurrected.END OF SPOILER.In brief; Tom can do better. He does not need to be controlled by the Hollywood machine. Reject this movie so he tries to give us something worth seeing.",Oblivion
134,bryank-04844,"'Oblivion' is visually stunning film, one that should be seen on the big screen. Unfortunately, it falls short in the ways of storytelling or originality.",7,23 August 2015,"It's been a great couple of years for science fiction fans. The genre has shown its big head again, and the masses seem to be eating it up. As we gear up for 'Elysium', 'Pacific Rim' and 'Star Trek into Darkness' (just to name a few) later this year, leading the way before summer is Tom Cruise's mega-budget 'Oblivion', directed by Joseph Kosinski, whose only previous film credit was 'Tron: Legacy'. I have no doubt that this will make tons of money at the box office, but it will likely leave a mixed taste of sweet and sour when most viewers leave the theater.To put it simply, 'Oblivion' is a giant mix of your favorite sci-fi films rolled into one 124-minute spectacle. While that might sound good on paper, sort of like a sci-fi nerd's paradise on film, that paradise can overload very quickly. Unfortunately, 'Oblivion' doesn't just pay respect to previous sci-fi films, but bluntly rips them off.Much like how 'The Lord of the Rings' started, we open with a detailed recap of the last 60 years on Earth narrated by Tom Cruise's character, Jack Harper (apparently no relation to Jack Reacher, Cruise's character in his last movie). Jack tells us how aliens attacked Earth and our moon, which caused natural disasters that pretty much wiped out most of the planet and its human inhabitants. However, the survivors fought back with nukes to kill the aliens. Well, that ""worked"", but also destroyed the planet. Now, the humans live in a giant space station that takes all of Earth's natural resources for energy to transfer onto a new planet. Jack's job is to make sure that these giant machines do their job without getting destroyed by leftover aliens, who are referred to as ""scavengers.""'Oblivion' takes several twists and turns throughout, all with different aspects of the sci-fi genre. The plot is reminiscent of Pixar's 'Wall-E', as Harper refers to himself as part of the clean-up crew of an abandoned Earth and even carries a little plant in a can that proves life can now sustain itself after the nuclear fallout. The giant space station looks eerily similar to the mothership in 'Independence Day', so much so that I expected Will Smith to pull out a cigar and say, ""Welcome to Earth.""To help Jack out on his missions, he's assisted by robotic drones, which are blatant knock-offs of Eve in 'Wall-E' and the robots from the video game 'Portal'. These drones talk, have unlimited fire power, can travel fast, and are extremely hard to kill. And what do all of these drones have for a camera and voice box? That famous red- eyed camera, made famous in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. When Jack finally meets up with Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), I thought I was seeing an older Morpheus from 'The Matrix' films.There's a point during the film where you just say, ""OK, I get that you're paying respect to classic sci-fi films, but let's do something original."" I can easily name several other instances of sci-fi films that 'Oblivion' pays homage to, but I don't want to ruin the surprises – or lack thereof – as you can see some of the twists and turns coming from a parsec away. This is not a typical all-out action film with tons of futuristic guns blazing non-stop and spaceship chases. No, this more of slower paced, character driven film, which at times seems to overstay its welcome just a tiny bit too long.I don't mind a slower paced movie, but when it travels in circles and ends up doing the same thing again and again is where I start to lose interest. That being said, the film is a marvel to see on the big screen. It's quite beautiful to look at, even with its desolate landscapes. The futuristic flying machines, guns and other objects are all created with some pretty spectacular effects. I also saw 'Oblivion' with the new Dolby Atmos sound system, which might be the best sound I have ever heard during a film. (Atmos has around 64 speakers in the theater that line the side walls, the back walls and the ceiling above. Each speaker is independently controlled, and smoothly and flawlessly pour out the sound.) It was a great experience, and if you have a Dolby Atmos equipped theater near you, I highly recommend seeing it there.Tom Cruise does a decent enough job here playing a guy who slowly figures out that things are not what they seem. However, I thought his characters in 'Jack Reacher' and the latest 'Mission: Impossible' had more depth and were more entertaining to watch. Morgan Freeman is always great to see on screen, but feels a bit underused and doesn't have enough screen time. Cruise has two female co-stars. Both Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko turn in solid performances, but are ultimately forgettable. It's great to see Melissa Leo in the mix, as well as Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau (Jaime Lannister from 'Game of Thrones') and Zoe Bell ('Death Proof'), who show up in their tiny roles.'Oblivion' is visually stunning film, one that should be seen on the big screen. Unfortunately, it falls short in the ways of storytelling or originality. You can't make a quality movie by putting together your favorite aspects of previous films and expect it to be coherent. If you're a sci-fi fan, you'll probably want to see 'Oblivion', even if its flaws outweigh its strengths.",Oblivion
135,witster18,so close.,7,4 September 2013,"""Oblivion"" borrows quite a bit from films like ""Moon"", ""Prometheus"", and ""Matrix"", and NO DOUBT, it is a skillfully crafted sci-fi film.The films twists are anything but surprising, but they work in the context of the story, and add a bit of flavor to the ending.The film could have really been great if it had allowed Morgan Freeman's character to expand a bit on the plot/history.I went into this with fairly high expectations. At the mid-way point, I thought this was headed towards a 5-6 rating, but the last 30 minutes is probably the strongest part of the film.mild spoiler alert. One of the problems with the film is that the opening narration is completely under-minded by what follows. The film might have been better without it.more mild spoilers. Cruise and the rest of the cast does an admirable job, but the script doesn't really tackle the inner-struggles of the lead character like it should. That's where a film like ""Moon"" surpasses ""Oblivion"". Just because ""your memory has been wiped""(even though we find that's not really the case), it doesn't mean that the strength of the human-spirit should be so dulled as it is here. The film hit on some of these subjects with the Lake retreat and other aspects(the books etc), but in terms of character development and drama it wanes. Even ""Equilibrium"" didn't gloss over these themes as much as they do here. If the filmmakers had changed that aspect of this film - it would have been one of the years best.I can recommend this, but it's still a bit frustrating how the story is seemingly complete, but the struggles of the characters are not well represented.67/100You might like this if you liked: The Host(not as good as this), Moon(better than this), Matrix(better than this), or Avatar(about even).",Oblivion
136,ersinkdotcom,"""Oblivion"" pays homage to 1970s and 1980s sci-fi films while dragging it out of the dark and into the light",9,30 April 2013,"Tom Cruise never ceases to amaze me. People can go on and on about his crazy behavior and couch-jumping antics all they want. The bottom line is the guy is a good actor and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. It's obvious he loves his job and goes to great lengths to do it, which includes doing his own stunts as much as a director or producer will allow. ""Oblivion"" is another excellent example of Tom Cruise at his finest.The great thing is ""Oblivion"" benefits from having Cruise in it but doesn't rest on that alone. It's a great movie with beautiful scenery, above-average CGI, and an interesting blend of several different plot lines from classic sci-fi films of the past. The story elements aren't breaking any new ground. However, director Joseph Kosinski's concept of taking science fiction into the daylight should be recognized as a step in a different direction.Jack Harper and his partner, Victoria, are the last remaining humans on the war-torn Earth. They're assigned to watch over powerful machines used to collect what's left of the planet's natural resources for use on a moon being colonized by the survivors of an alien invasion. As the job is wrapping up and it grows closer to time for them to leave and move on to their new lives, bizarre dreams and occurrences awaken Jack's suspicions about his mission and who he is.Most sci-fi films take place in a constantly dark world that conveniently helps hide any CGI limitations filmmakers might run into. Kosinski's ""Oblivion"" embraces the light and no doubt made it a bit more difficult on CGI artists whose jobs it is to blend the animated images with the real. They did a good job for the most part and the movie looks breathtaking.It's interesting to see how Kosinski incorporated the stark whites and bubbly numbers of the 1970s and 1980s science fiction classics without making ""Oblivion"" look aged. Any number of those films will come to mind while watching it. It's hard not to draw comparisons to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Alien,"" ""Outland,"" and many others.The story isn't the strong point of the movie, although it shouldn't be looked at as a straight retread of anything before. It's more a conglomeration of several plots from different sci-fi movies of the past. There are key ingredients from ""Highlander 2,"" ""City of Ember,"" and any number of movies addressing the issue of cloning or an alien race's need of our natural resources for survival (""War of the Worlds,"" ""Battle: Los Angeles,"" and ""Independence Day"").Cruise's supporting cast in ""Oblivion"" includes Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, and Andrea Riseborough. Freeman plays the leader of an underground resistance in the same way he plays everything. He's the wise man who doesn't take crap from anybody. Kurylenko and Riseborough play the two women in Cruise's life. They portray their individual characters with convincing emotional ranges. The last thing I'd like to address is the musical score by M83. It sounds very much like the music heard in ""Tron: Legacy"" by Daft Punk. The soundtrack here resembles ""Tron: Legacy"" layered on top of Hans Zimmer's score for ""The Dark Knight Rises."" it fits the film's tone and enhances the viewing experience for the audience.""Oblivion"" is an entertaining journey into a grim future that doesn't look as dark as most genre films make it out to be. There's no real lessons to learn here, except maybe don't trust anyone at face value. It's just a good old-fashioned sci-fi action piece with a bit of a twist and more emotional depth than we're used to from these types of movies.",Oblivion
137,Likes_Ninjas90,Its ideas dissolve from your mind as quickly as the film,4,14 April 2013,"Is Hollywood still capable of writing interesting characters? It's distressing how rapidly mainstream films are losing touch with the opening thirty minutes of a story, failing to engage us with detailed characterisation, interesting backstories and personal motives to drive the character's personal reasons for their journey. Character development is reduced for the sake of action because studios doubt the attention span of audiences. Oblivion was based on an unpublished graphic novel by the film's director Joseph Kosinski (TRON: Legacy) and is inexcusable for its dreary writing and vacuous characters. Peaking just over the two hour mark and featuring a rich cast, this is should have been brimming with personality and energy. Instead, this is a long, dry, waste of talent, prioritising its leading man's stunt capabilities over its tired science fiction tropes. In the year 2077, Tom Cruise plays space soldier Jack, whose voice-over tells us that the Moon has been destroyed due to an invasion on Earth by the Scavs. The Scavs lost the battle in a nuclear war, which means that Jack and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), living on a penthouse above the ruins of the Earth, and are tasked by Sally (Melissa Leo) to be on cleanup duty by repairing aerial drones and taking down remaining Scavs. Jack has had his memory wiped but is still haunted by faded recollections of Julia (Olga Kurylenko), a woman he sees in his dreams. He is also troubled by his increasingly dangerous missions around the Earth, discovering a conspiracy about what really happened and the appearance of the mysterious Beech (Morgan Freeman). Relying singularly on Cruise proves fatal. I don't think I've ever him this dull before. Fifty years old, he's no longer playing a character but an avatar that moves between stunts. His role is terribly written, lacking any personality or characterisation and failing to utilise his charisma.With a join the dots plot, the film is mostly action substituting story. Each of Jack's missions is a setpiece, with a small clue for the overall mystery tacked onto it. You can imagine the pictures of the graphic novel laid out in production instead of the script - such is the thinness of the narrative. Someone also decided that Cruise shouldn't be upstaged by the other actors so the female characters are largely distanced from the action and both Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo are treated expendably. Freeman only has two or three scenes, wearing a silly outfit of a cloak and sunglasses, smoking a cigar, while she's left to being a talking head on a computer screen. Kosinski has said that the film is about love, because of a familiar subplot involving a forgotten love interest, but that's unjustifiable when the lead is surrounded by two equally bland women with no chemistry between them. Their dialogue is dull, stilted space jargon, which fails to add any feeling or warmth. Among the many science fiction clichés are clones, mole people, and oppressive computers, thinking by themselves. The only original facet I considered was whether there was a social comment about unmanned military drones attacking people, which is admittedly a rather timely thought. It seemed more interesting than the superfluous and tensionless action, where Jack is able to survive multiple falls and injuries.Some might debate the complexity of the film's survivalist and dystopian themes, but where is the emotional hook? Before a film can engage you with its concepts, it must allow you to invest in its characters, which can then be used as an embodiment of the themes themselves. Without this attachment, Oblivion is an interminable crawl and the worst that can be said about the film is that despite borrowing heavily from The Matrix and Inception, its ideas dissolve from your mind as quickly as the film.",Oblivion

I quite enjoy action movies that are set in another time with cool gadgets and end of the world themes. This one is no exception. It is a good movie, not great, but it is interesting and entertaining enough.The movie continually keeps you guessing as to what will happen but there are a few dull moments that creep in every now and then. Although I do find myself asking the question of why did they only have two people looking after such an important task? It is one inconsistency that seems odd to me. Of course if this wasn't so then there would be no movie.Overall this is a movie that is definitely worth seeing if you like Sci-Fi action films but don't expect anything too over the top action based or overly intelligent. It is a nice compromise between the two.",Oblivion
141,griffolyon12,"Seen It Before, but Beautifully Shot and Well Acted",7,20 April 2013,"Tron: Legacy director, Joseph Kosinski's latest, is a sci-fi flick based on his own graphic novel, starring Tom Cruise, called Oblivion.After Earth was attacked by aliens, humanity had no choice but to use nukes, in so doing they won the war but made Earth uninhabitable. Cut forward to 60 years later, where we meet Tom Cruise's Jack Harper, a drone repairman living on Earth in a glass tower high up in the sky. His job is to repair the drones that protect the machines harvesting Earth's remaining water for the humans that moved to Saturn's moon, Titan. However, when a mysterious spacecraft crashlands on Earth, Jack finds human survivors in the wreckage, spurring everything to change.Harking back to 1970's science fiction films like Logan's Run or THX 1138, nothing in Oblivion is ever what it seems. There are so many twist and turns to this movie, it would be very easy to get lost, if you didn't see every one of them coming. Almost every twist has been done before in other sci-fi films, with far more realistic thinking as to what the repercussions of such discoveries truly would have on a person. Of course a big part to this is that the script just doesn't give enough information. They often gloss over things in one line that needed to be explained to be understood fully, and that might have made a few more of the character's actions make sense. Even with all of this said, there is a lot of good about Oblivion.The cinematography by Claudio Miranda is just hauntingly beautiful. Miranda and Kosinski's use of the Icelandic landscapes standing in for ruined America, were expertly used to create a scope that has been sorely lacking from almost every other sci-fi film over the past few decades. Not to mention the design work of this film, which is architecturally stunning, just like Kosinski's Tron: Legacy was. As well, even though the plot twists often murk up the story, the characters are always so likable and intriguing, you keep going along with them, and a large part of that is due to the good performances of its cast. Tom Cruise is easy to root for in this movie, but the write home performance is Andrea Riseborough, who plays Jack's partner up in the sky tower, Victoria. Riseborough makes simple three word lines of dialogue have far more weight than the script gave them because one can tell that she is always applying subtext through the tone of her voice and her facial mannerisms. Riseborough truly deserves more international notice of her talents.Ultimately, while you've seen everything in Oblivion before, and done with more satisfying results, Oblivion is still a good, enjoyable sci-fi film worth seeing on the big screen thanks to great performances from its cast that make the most of their characters and the gigantic canvas that the film is set against.I give Oblivion a 7 out of 10!",Oblivion

143,Imdbidia,"Amazing visuals, OK film",6,28 April 2017,"I love Tom Cruise in action + science fiction movies. He is one of the few actors who seem to believe those futuristic roles and is usually great in this sort of films. That being the case, I was looking forward to watching this film.From the production and design point of view, this is a fantastic film, spectacular scenery and camera takes, very sleek futuristic design and a great atmosphere. Unlike your usual galactic out space story, this is not dark or cold, but very light, airy, bright and beautiful. The story starts very promisingly, but soon deflates because the script starts to wander unnecessarily and is not organically presented to viewers, who will feel in a constant state of What the Heck? once the action starts. The plot, albeit intriguing and original, is not well developed for the big screen, and it is not clear enough, does not have a good tempo, it does not build up properly for the ending, and the editing contributes to the narrative confusion, when, in fact, the script is not that complex. Personally, I think Andrea Riseborough is the best of the bunch in this film; she carries most of the intrigue, drama and confusion of the story with her acting. Cruise is good in his role, although not as convincing an brilliant as in the film he would shot the following year, Edge of Tomorrow. Olga Kurylenko is really sweet as Julia, and Morgan Freeman OK as the scavenger Bleech.This is an enjoyable film with amazing visuals and, a priori, intriguing and original script, but the story is poorly told, the dialogues not especially inspired and the acting just all right. It could have been super-duper, but it is not because amazing visuals rarely make an amazing movie by themselves.",Oblivion
144,Mr_Sensitive,Not Really Satisfy With It.,5,22 April 2013,"The main reason I went to see this movie was because of Joseph Kosinski and what he has done with Tron: Legacy (that movie was awesome by the way!!). This movie has potential to become really good but I think because of its story that lack substance it bring the whole thing down.This movie is more like a sci fi/ drama rather than sci fi/action that we mostly get nowadays but never the less there are still some action to enjoy. Yes, only some (very few to be precise). The story of a man left on the ruined earth with only one mission: to extract Earth's remaining resources and repair driod. Sound fun? Yes it is. But sitting in the theatre for one full hour watching Tom Cruise repair droid ain't much of a fun (it will come to the point when you will thinking to yourself – ""will there be anything happen in this movie?) The second part of the movie is when most stuff happen, when things get more interesting and clues start reveling and action start happening. Everything squeezes into this one hour that you hardly get to know and feel for the movie. I don't think I even get the name of Morgan Freeman.Anyway apart from the story everything is not bad. It got brilliant direction, acting (by Tom Cruise), CGI, music and the tone of the movie. But with weird choppy dialogue and the story that has been told a million times in other movie - this left me totally unsatisfied with this movie. If this wasn't for Tom Cruise and good CGI I think this movie going to fail. My recommendation: Worth a rental!!Rating: 5/10",Oblivion

146,Laakbaar,Great sci-fi adventure,8,4 May 2013,"I rather enjoyed this movie. I found the story to be intriguing and the film beautifully made. It particularly excels in showing us future technology and a devastated world. Cruise's performance was superb. The movie has a couple of neat twists, but I don't want to give them away.It continues to amaze me that filmmakers can produce movies with such incredible special effects. The special effects in this movie are indeed spectacular.If I have any complaint, it's that the film caters too much to those who go to the movies to see chase scenes and shootouts. For about 5 minutes, the movie actually morphed into a video game.Also, it annoyed me that Morgan Freeman was in this movie. He can be great at times, but he is grossly overexposed. I almost considered not going because of his presence.The current IMDb score is inexplicably too low. I checked out a few earlier reviews to see why. Reading some of these reviews, it seems that the lower scores hinge on three factors: (1) the presence of Cruise; (2) the similarity to other movies; and (3) lack of realism.It seems there are some people who atavistically dislike Cruise and wish he would abandon Hollywood and stop making movies. I get that. But regardless of what you think of Cruise, he remains a talented actor; he shows here he can easily and convincingly play the lead role in an action-adventure movie. (Come to think of it, I cannot think of a recent movie in which Cruise has not excelled.)It's more or less impossible now to produce any movie that does not remind moviegoers of earlier films. All movies are derivative, to a certain extent. And to give this movie a ""1"" for that reason is unfair. This movie is absolutely not a ripoff of ""Moon"". There was one similar plot device. That was it. And even if movies are similar, so what? References and allusions are standard in any medium or genre. They give a movie depth.Some reviewers have dissected the movie to look for aspects that are less than completely realistic. However, I noticed none of their points while watching the movie. It all worked for me, and if something is truly unrealistic I notice it immediately. There was nothing that was so jarringly unrealistic that it ruined the film for me.I'd go see this one.",Oblivion
147,dfa120374,Cruise Delivers Again,7,14 January 2015,"The year's 2077. Earth has become a desolate & remote planet after an attack - and subsequent destruction - on the moon by alien beings called Scavengers. The human race now inhabit Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, but Jack Harper (Cruise), who's a clone & security technician, has been assigned to stay on earth along with girlfriend Victoria (Riseborough), who's a communications officer, and keep the Scavs from trying to destroy important buildings known as hydros. However, after rescuing a single survivor from a crash site then reluctantly coming into contact with the Scavs, he discovers that everything's not as it seems on earth.Put bluntly Oblivion is an absolute epic feast for the eyes. Everything's shot on such a massive scale with the special & visual effects being nothing short of stunning right the way through. After watching, you can definitely see why the film cost an estimated $120m to produce.Story-wise, it's nothing really original or special, but that doesn't make it bad, and it's well played out at a good steady pace. There aren't really any boring parts either, and it definitely keeps your attention. Pay close attention though, because if you don't you can become lost pretty easily (as I found out with my wife about a third of the way through after I heard a muttered ""I'm lost"").Like him or loathe him, Tom Cruise delivers once again. He may seem a bit out there at times off-screen, but on-screen he brings it home and plays the part of Harper so well. Riseborough is a touch annoying with her ""butter wouldn't melt"" English accent and persona, but thankfully it's not enough to ruin the movie. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman. Absolute brilliance no matter what he's in or how long he's in it for.Overall, if you love sci-fi movies which are set on a massive scale such as this, or even just sci-fi movies in general, then you will be drooling over this one. Even if sci-fi isn't your main thing, Oblivion is most definitely worth watching.",Oblivion
148,billygoat1071,Among The Gorgeous Exteriors,6,10 April 2013,"Oblivion feels like a homage to the old science fiction films where it explores around its world, shows off its landscapes, soar all the ships that used to be made out of cardboard, and let the characters scrutinize until the plot finds the actual conflict. The film features plenty of amazing concepts and spectacular visuals that could be intriguing. There seems to be a theme at the first half but all the questionable twists made the plot convoluted. It's disappointing when it hits to that point. It still can be entertaining and the technical work is indeed a splendor. There's plenty of potential around but there is still something missing in the end.The film reminiscence a lot of popular sci-fi films. It has the exteriors of Planet of the Apes and a plot that runs and remind you of Alien, Total Recall, and I Am Legend(I don't want to spoil the next film that resembles). The first act is totally gripping by introducing its high concept. When it proceeds to the actual story, there is suppose to be even more mindblowing than it was shown. It throws away some intriguing twists, but the film doesn't bother explaining enough what's the point about it. There's also an interesting pathos of Jack missing the old less-broken world at the beginning, but the story easily ignores it. Many would think it doesn't matter, but that might possibly bring some soul to the picture. It's centrally about finding the protagonist's identity. The romance is ought to be important for his journey but this relationship wasn't develop much, leading as a typical love subplot. The performances are just typical for the actors. Tom Cruise plays his usual hero roles. It's fine for the film's character though. Morgan Freeman once again serving up details of the plot. The only thing what's different is he wears a costume that looks pretty good to him.Despite of the underwhelming storytelling, we still get to see some rich futuristic details. The film has its own style and creates a marvelous world. Other than the whimsically designed rubble of the destroyed earth, all the weapons, ships, and costumes are quite snazzy to appeal for those who seek for eye catching stuff. If there's one thing Joseph Kosinski has improved then that would be the suspense. Tron: Legacy actually had none of them, this one knows the aesthetics of a sci-fi horror thriller. Those thrills are just limited, though. He's still in his comfort zone by only caring for the pretty visuals and the techno soundtrack.Oblivion is almost better than it was expected. It would have been as good as it looks like if only it was eager to put more explanation about the intrigue, and soul to the story. It leaves the audience thought provoked. The bright side is it's not one of those generically loud modern sci-fi films. It's one of those basic, yet classic style of science fiction. It's a great thing especially for this era of blockbusters. Everything in the film looks stunning and breathtaking. It's terribly entertaining as well if we don't mind those flaws. Again, the film offered something remarkable but fails to execute because of its pretension. We get it, the visuals and the soundtrack are the best part of the film, but I think it deserves better than those. Honestly, Oblivion can be a classic if it adds something smarter and much meaningful. For now, all the beautiful landscapes that were featured will be the only thing that would spellbind the audience throughout.",Oblivion
149,dilipbts,Oblivion,7,10 July 2020,"I hadn't really heard of Oblivion before I watched it, but I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise and his films, as he is such an excellent actor. Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.The characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.The special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.As I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.The overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.It's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion. In fact I only watched it last week, but after writing this review, I'm tempted to watch it again tonight.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and continue to do so!",Oblivion
150,bheadher,Can't I hope that a good movie will show eventually???,3,25 August 2013,"I keep trying to find that one good scifi movie that will pay us back for all the drivel that occupies the movie industry lately.Wayul, this one isn't it!!! Tremendously slow moving through most of the movie, Oblivion never really captures your imagination. It is missing the most critical piece for any scifi movie, a solid plot that you can follow but not predict.This plot is simply choppy, with Tom Cruise spending much of the time flying around in a suped up flitter bug/combination jet with a anti-rotation helicopter tail rotor. There are a mix of quick action scenes straight out of a Nintendo game, sewed together with uninspiring fill in love making and background Earth devastation plot that never makes sense. Morgan Freeman tries mightily to explain the entire movie plot in 5 minutes of dialog, but comes up way short of saving this one. In fact, Morgan Freeman is the only one who I found interesting at all.Maybe it's just because I'm an OLD (ok, ancient) scifi fanatic, but can't I hope that there will be at least one more good (or great) scifi movie from this current generation of movie peoples??? Perhaps, but I'm getting real tired of drivel!",Oblivion
151,TheSquiss,It's fun & it won't ruin your night. Just don't think about the plot holes,4,23 April 2013,"Tom Cruise is one of the few films who can 'open' a film merely by starring, regardless of the quality. Oblivion proves the point. Cruise's latest offering is far from awful but there are plot holes big enough to fly spaceships through and it falls a long way short of his and Spielberg's futuristic masterpiece, Minority Report. Nevertheless, it'll make profit. HUGE profit! The only way to point out the many, many plot holes is to ruin the film so forget them, sit back, disengage brain and go with the flow.It's 2077, Earth has been abandoned following the invasion and destruction at the hands of the alien 'Scavs', and Jack Harper (Cruise) is one of the last remaining drone repairmen overseeing, repairing and zipping around the small 'safe segment of the planet. He and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) live in clinical quarters (with the best swimming pool you've ever seen!) high above Earth's surface; an 'effective team', as they repeatedly assure Sally (Melissa Leo), their superior in some far-off mission control.But while Victoria is unquestioning in her loyalty to Sally and the mission, Jack questions his raison d'être and is plagued by dreams of a woman he cannot possibly know from a time long gone by. And then there's the small matter of the 'Scavs' who remain on Earth and keep shooting down the drones.Cruise coasts along in Oblivion. It's an easy role in which he flies, runs, jumps, looks great on screen (far younger than his 51 years) and flexes his face to portray sincerity, thoughtfulness AND heroism. There's nothing wrong with his performance at all. He's perfect in the role; he's Tom Cruise! He's just not given the film, script or role that requires him to really act. Oblivion, fun as it is, is no Magnolia or Born on the 4th of July.Likewise, neither Oscar winner (for The Fighter) Leo nor Olga Kurylenko, as the girl of Jack's dreams, Julia, has depth written for them. Leo is little more than a displeased face upon a screen and Kurylenko doesn't appear to know what to do with Julia. It is left to Riseborough to provide the variation and gravitas and she blends from docile subservience to cold, determination seamlessly but still allows a hint of inner concern to bleed though her eyes. Other actors might hurl turmoil at us but Riseborough is as controlled in her performance as Victoria is in her duty. Hot on the heels of Welcome to the Punch, it's a reminder of the value that she quietly adds to any project.I can't avoid mentioning Morgan Freeman because he appears in the trailer even though, given half a thought, it's a clear indication of the way the film is going. He rolls along happily, looking pretty sprightly for an apparent octogenarian, as Beech, the um, yeah, I have to stop there or it gives the game away.Stop thinking, stop asking, just watch. It looks good, it's reasonable fun and it's not going to ruin your night just as long as you don't think about the plot holes. The dirty great big gaps in reason. The huge...Okay, I can't bite my tongue any longer. If you don't want Oblivion ruined for you stop reading now. I feel the need to rant about just a few of the 'issues' that bugged me.************ PLOT SPOILER ALERT ************ I emerged from Oblivion satisfied that I'd been reasonably entertained but troubled, no, downright annoyed, by the appalling lack of thought and reasoning by director/scriptwriter Joseph Kosinski. Either he didn't notice the glaring errors, in which case who the hell gave him the budget and the directors' chair, or he didn't care, in which case who the hell gave him the budget and the directors' chair? I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on the following: How does Jack remain unaware of the other Jacks on identical platforms around the world? There must be thousands of them. And why don't any other Jacks investigate the explosion on the power station? Why bother with the whole Titan story for Jack & Victoria? Why not programme the clones to follow orders unquestionably and without the need for bribery? Furthermore, why do the aliens bother with human clones in the first place? Why not just plonk their own army down there and avoid all risks? Why is it that after 60 years of warfare and abandonment, the dust that covers 90% of Empire State Building has managed to defy gravity and avoided falling into Jack's valley? Not one speck rests on a tree, not one single dust mote rolls across the fields! Why did it take three years to bring the new Jack to Julia? What happened to him after Jack MKI pummeled him?Why didn't NASA pick up the escape pod 60 years ago when it was launched? How did the flight recorder on the escape capsule record the conversation on the main ship when they were travelling at great speed in opposite directions, putting thousands of miles between them? How was it that Sally knew Jack was lying by his heart rate but couldn't tell it was Beech and not Julia in the pod. For that matter, why the need to put her in the pod anyway? She knows she's going back, Sally knows he's bringing her back and there are two seats! Who sat in the producer's chair and thought, Ah, the audience is too stupid to notice?Maybe they were right. Box office receipts don't lie, right? Oblivion is box-office gold and Tom Cruise remains pretty high on the bankability pile.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Oblivion
152,RevRonster,Better than I thought it would be...,7,15 August 2013,"I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise but, lately (thanks to films like ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Tropic Thunder""), I've started to come around to the man who made an acting career out of running really fast and smiling a lot.""Oblivion"" feels like the classic sci-fi stories of old. The story is fantastic as it grabs you right away at the beginning. Sadly, it started to drag for me in the middle but it kicks it back up into high gear and heads straight on into a killer ending! The performances are top notch and it's probably the most entertaining I've seen Cruise in awhile (except for ""Tropic Thunder,"" that one will always be my favorite starring him).Finally, the special effects are just incredible and the sound is unparalleled! For having no real expectations going into this movie, I was more than pleasantly surprised with how entertaining the film was. The only drag was the low point the story takes in the middle. Besides that, it's awesome!",Oblivion
153,davidgee,A dog's breakfast - soulless and incomprehensible,5,18 April 2013,"Take a mega-millions CGI budget, a charismatic superstar and a post- apocalyptic sci-fi theme and you may come up with a movie that's as thrilling as TOTAL RECALL (the Schwarzenegger original, not last year's crap remake) or as mystifying as INCEPTION - or you might just come up with a dog's breakfast like OBLIVION.I wish I could tell you the storyline but it defeated me. In a not-too- distant future, Earth has been devastated by aliens who have left pea- shaped flying gunships to eliminate the last few survivors (cue Morgan Freeman in a small and thankless role). The alien Mothership is a kind of giant jam puff run by Sally, a female version of our old chum HAL. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, a roving repairman employed (don't ask why) by Sally. He lives in an aerial penthouse with a see-through swimming pool: not the Ideal Home for anyone with a fear of heights. He has a female companion (Andrea Riseborough) who's a bit like a Stepford Wife, but then he rescues a mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko) from a crashed spaceship and begins to question his role on this ravaged planet and the history of its destruction. Are you still with me? To be honest, I'm not sure I'm still with me!Without Tom Cruise OBLIVION would be a turkey: he gives this soulless movie a human dimension and makes its incomprehensibility just about endurable. The story, we're told, comes from a graphic novel, but it seems little more than a mishmash of borrowings from the last 55 years of sci-fi: from 2001 through THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL to WALL-E. The CGI is seriously thrilling, but this visual feast is, like I said, a dog's breakfast.",Oblivion

155,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,"Search, Recover, Destroy",6,21 April 2013,"Thankfully Tom Cruise, as Jack, repeats the backstory of OBLIVION somewhere in the middle section – it's all part of an progressively intricate plot that gets a tad confusing when a new character is introduced into the contained vessel where Jack and his partner Victoria are a team sent to, as the description goes, ""extract Earth's remaining resources."" This has to do with recovering and fixing damaged drone devices sent down to take out any rogue scavengers. And it all happened because some alien force blew up part of the moon, causing the elements to destroy most of the Earth.The drones are lethal orbs that only respond to Jack's voice recognition. The coolest scenes are in the beginning as he either flies around or rides a high-tech motorcycle, putting the irritable machines back into working order. Then the plot thickens when one of the drones almost kills Jack, who eventually discovers survivors in the murky underground, led by Morgan Freeman's wise and/or crazy old man, Beech.It wouldn't be fair to delve any further into the storyline since so much relies on tricks and turns and, of course, that important element all films post M. Night and LOST have to acquire: the twist ending or in this particular case, several twist middles, turning an exploration based sci-fi into a Film Noirish love story: the main character risks everything to help a damsel in distress, who, with a few secrets of her own, shuffles the deck even more. That's when things get clunky and the inevitable final battle (the first of two climaxes), involving a horde of hell bent drones, is a more expensive, digitalized version of the MAD MAX universe. And this isn't the first cinematic similarity: the main setup, of a ""worker"" cleaning up after an abandoned Earth, borrows from Pixar's computer animated WALL-E and, well, we won't take away points for unoriginality but for throwing too many cooks into the mix – all with very similar features.",Oblivion
156,JoelChamp85,Piece Of Sci-fi Art,9,3 April 2021,"This is a great idea for a film and very well executed. Cruise nails his role. The world the filmmakers have created is desolate but beautiful with some very inspiring sci-fi imagery. Sometimes I can't tell what's real and what's CGI, it's done in a way that really compliments the story. The story itself is well paced and thought out and something I continue to watch for inspiration in my work.",Oblivion
157,osj2507,Not one of the most memorable,6,12 September 2015,"A lot of Sci-fi films have and are coming out at the moment, the one thing about Sci-fi is that they have to be big, bold and filled with CGI, Action and adventure :)I do think this film has a lot of qualities, I do also think that it will not be one of the most memorable films in this genre this year, but it has a lot of good effects, small pearls that keeps the story interesting, surprising and watchable. But there are also things that are not working in this, things that seems too much, changeable during the film and maybe a bit strange.Beech played by Morgan Freeman is one of the more enjoyable characters and even though he is not as mysteries as he appear, he does a great job. Jack Harper played by Tom Cruise is a very typical calm on the surface a bit of a hot head on the inside, action Tom Cruise character, he does all right, but we are missing some humor for this character (way to serious).It is an entertaining, very scenic movie, a lot of action and good elements of sci-fi, but it still feels like something is missing, and the story is a bit too strange at times or too unbelievable.",Oblivion
158,ebeckstr-1,Vastly underrated,9,14 September 2021,"One of the most underrated and sadly overlooked science fiction movies of the last 20 years. Director Joseph Kosinski and Tom Cruise collaborated closely to create a thematically complex character-driven story, set in a beautifully detailed and luxuriously rendered world. One particularly notable feature of the film are the parallels of character, set design, and other details, the first set of which is established in the first half of the movie and the mirror of which begin to emerge in the second half of the movie.I remember being rather dismissive of this movie upon seeing the trailers because it just looked like any other action sci-fi set in some dystopian future. I was wrong, or maybe the trailer wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Anyway, upon watching it several times now, including once with the commentary by Cruise and Kosinski, and watching the special features on the disc, I've developed a much deeper appreciation of so many details I missed even upon repeated viewing. In addition, Kozinski's successful effort to do as many of the effects in camera as possible, and realizing how much of what you see on screen which you might assume is CG is not in fact CG, and myriad other details, again, filled me with genuine appreciation for the artistry of this movie. Besides all of that, it's just a cracking good story.Incidentally, I highly recommend renting or buying the disc. Cruise is exceptional on commentaries. While he does not direct or edit movies, he has an absolute expert knowledge of every process and technology associated with filmmaking. He knows lenses, special effects, film history, everything. You can learn a lot about filmmaking by listening to him dialogue with directors about films they've made together. Such is the case with the commentary on Oblivion, and the making of features, which also include brief interview moments with Cruise.",Oblivion
159,Al_The_Strange,Oblivion Review,9,15 April 2013,"I was initially drawn into this film for its post-apocalyptic landscapes and the promise of plenty of eye candy. Overall, the film delivers tremendously; the whole film is really slick-looking, with a modest array of high-tech vehicles, weapons, and gadgets on display, as the main character explores a ruined Earth and confronts aliens, robots, bad guys, and more. There are some really cool chases, fights, and shootouts throughout the film, which are satisfying without getting overblown. Pacing is not terribly fast, but not really that slow either; it finds an ample comfort zone somewhere between being action-packed and letting the story breathe.Even though there is a lot of style and spectacle involved, most of Oblivion is driven by a certain mystery revolving around the characters and events, which keep you glued to the story to see where the character goes and what he discovers. The twists that pop up are somewhat predictable (especially since some things may have been spoiled in the trailer already), and the story overall takes on a familiar formula seen in plenty of other films. However, the big twists and all their subtle nuances make good sense and stimulate enough brain cells to make it a satisfying storytelling venture. Characters are developed just enough to make them stand out, and the film overall has just enough of an emotional touch to make it feel important. If there's anything to complain about, it would be a few minor nitpicks (chief among them, the ending looks so much like the ending for Independence Day).This film has very solid photography and editing. Acting is pretty decent; I'm not that much of a Tom Cruise fan, but I felt he did this role good justice, while the leading ladies offered the best performances. Writing is pretty good. This production has some excellent sets, props, and costumes. A few special effects seems weak, but most are great. Music is quite impressive and appropriate as well (bears much in common with the Tron: Legacy score).The most critical of audiences might just write this one off as more style over substance, but it is a darn good style. It's not high-brow sci-fi, but the story is clever enough to rise above most other gloopy Hollywood blockbusters. And for a sci-fi fan like myself, I felt it was perfectly entertaining and interesting.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",Oblivion

It's far, far too long and it's mystery's payoff is not worth it. The first half is superior to the last half and a lot of the way it's handled undoes the good of the first half.

It's not perfect, but it delivers great value.The photography and the special effects are phenomenal. A must see in IMAX. The action is great. The dialogs are good. The acting is just right. Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, and Melissa Leo all performed without flaw. The ideas behind the scenario are great, and the story is very interesting with nice rebounds. I would have like to explored this world to a greater depth. Very interesting.An annoying little thing is that the backstory is not clear, and when an explanation comes from Freeman, it's just a bit too much ""telling the audience"".Now, for the flaws. The end is pathetic. The ""after"" should have been cut out, and you'd have a great fade out. It's a scene that's just an unnecessary Hollywood gimmick. Also, the woman should be on the Tet not at the cabin.I removed a full star for the ""after"", but beside that, the movie is a rock star.

163,lagudafuad,It is just there,6,22 April 2013,"The movie is more of a sight to see than a riddle job for the inquisitive mind, packed with enough twist and turns that puts you the viewer on a guess frenzy, Oblivion leaves you wondering where the threat is really coming from and whom to trust.With a beautiful sight for sore eyes setting, Oblivion's wonderful scenery and bubble craft will make you sit down and enjoy more of what is happening on the screen, than what the story is trying to pass across. Tom Cruise seems to be in top form, in Jack Reacher (2012) he showed his acting prowess and dominated the film from start to finish, here too he displays the same prowess and even making Morgan Freeman more of a side show to what is happening in the uprising between Tom Cruise character Commander Jack Harper and the alien threat (where ever it was coming from).Oblivion is based on an unpublished graphic novel of the same name by the director and producer Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy 2011). Joseph was able to bring to life his idea and concept, thanks to the 120 million production backing of universal studios. Although I still stand that the movie is a sight to see, it lacks in the area of its story, and it is not that the concept was not nice nor grand the screenplay was just boring at times. Do note they were action scenes to liven the mood, but the length in which you have to wait till the movie truly picks up, maybe worth it for some viewers, and may not for others.The storyline is about what happens 60 years after the earth got attacked by aliens known as Scavs. It focuses on one of the few remaining survivors Commander Jack Harper who was on earth as a drone repairmen. While fulfilling his duty he discovers a crashed spacecraft with happens to contain things that bring to question everything he believed about the war. Soon later he got captured by the said aliens that were still on the earth and he uncovers a truth that rocked his world to his entire existence.In the end I liked the way the movie turned out, it ended in a poetic tone and Tom Cruise's performance may be the greatest thing this movie has to offer other than the beautiful set pieces. So if you are a fan of the Mission Impossible man, then you will sure have fun seeing him here, but my final take is Oblivion could have been better.www.lagsreviews.com",Oblivion

A lot of the scenery is really beautiful although at times somewhat depressing. The design of the hardware is simply cool. The fact that there is plenty of action is of course also adding to the enjoyment factor of the movie.If you scrutinize each element of the movie individually I guess you can say ""been there, seen that, done that"" quite a few times. I do not think that would be fair though. With the amount of movies made since the dawn of movie making you can always find something that looks similar today. If you look at the movie as a whole I think it felt fresh enough and it did not in any way feel like a rip-off.Sometimes the movie went into slow mode / dream mode but I was never really bored.

166,rooee,Love in the Time of Massive Radiation,7,12 April 2013,"This is sweeping, serious sci-fi, concerning the last people on a future Earth, long since scoured by nuclear conflict. The enemy was/is a race called the Scavs. Tom Cruise plays Jack, who, along with his colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), stalks the wasteland, fixing drones and maintaining the rigs that promise to one day make the planet habitable once more. Above them is the Tet, a vast spacestation that promises to take the couple to Titan, where the rest of humanity awaits.Oblivion borrows from pretty much every sci-fi movie ever made, utopian and dystopian. Planet of the Apes. The Mad Max sequels. Late on, I glimpsed Independence Day, Sunshine and Battlestar Galactica in the space of ten minutes. Even Robocop is in there, with the drones barking like ED-209. A particular cynical viewer might suggest the film starts as Wall-E and turns into Moon. But it does have some of its own ideas, mostly with regard to the technology in which Jack and Victoria are immersed.Apart from the tech design, there is plenty to admire about Oblivion. Its plot might be derivative, and ultimately wraps itself in rather a neat bow, but it's well laid out, revealing the right bits at the right times. The music, by Joseph Trapanese, along with Anthony Gonzalez from the band M83, is suitably epic and stirring, cut from the same sonic cloth as Trapanese's work on Tron Legacy. The two key performances are those of Cruise (always game, always watchable) and more notably Riseborough, who's allowed to be alluring for once. Olga Kurylenko, as Julia, is somewhat blank as the third part of the love triangle.Tron Legacy was a poor movie because it had a poor script occupied by poor characters, and this is where Oblivion elevates itself above Joseph Kosinski's previous work. Here we have recognisable humans in the midst of drama. In particular, the fraught relationship between Jack and Victoria makes for some subtle, unspoken exchanges. The dinner between Jack, Victoria and Julia, is an expertly edited exercise in tension. And the scene where Victoria lures Jack into a transparent swimming pool is both seductive and sinister, like watching Michael Mann let loose on sci-fi.Oblivion was filmed using super-HD ""CineAlta"" cameras, all the better to do justice to the luscious visuals. We've seen it all before but never this beautifully rendered. And behind the sheen is a human heartbeat, which shouldn't be ignored. Oblivion is a fine love letter to classic sci-fi.",Oblivion

Outside of a cliché Hollywood ending, it creates a relatively original story and surprises to enjoy. If you have to pick 1 film to watch, go for Moon.The films IMDb recommends at the moment for people who like this are way off. Besides the 2 mentioned, the action in this has a lot of similarities to the action sequences in Star Wars prequels and the barren, desert-like surroundings a lot like the Road Warrior films. Cloud Atlas might also be a good pick.A lot of this film's effectiveness depends on surprises, so avoid spoilers if you want to truly enjoy it as much as possible.

The population on earth is billions; without medical attention are poor countries who often are bellow the poverty line because of 'no good reason' colonization.
A different approach to the climatic struggle that the western hemisphere is to undergo is the struggle for humanity because of global warming: it was us who created energy or fire but it won't be us to reclaim it. Then the struggle here is not human because it goes passed us in seeds by human love or sexually which in the end of humanity would be counter apocalyptic. 
A Sci fi movie or a movie in the future holds humans in sexual situations that are absurd with counter productive results: the humans after we are dead might look at our sexual innuendos as to the last of us. The humanity in the movie is strong like a episode in life that can be found if consumers outlive the consumed vegetables and fruits. 
Eating fruits brings life but vegetables leads to growth: scientific truth that both 'Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise' accept before the war against us is over. Then people viewers who see life against their medical situations might be blocked or considered 'not allowed'.

169,HelenMary,impressive visuals but a slow burner that fizzles out,5,26 January 2014,"I was bored watching this film, it took a while to get to the point. It is visually very attractive, all CGI, and you are intrigued as to what will happen mainly because you can't believe that it's so uneventful, but ultimately I didn't care. Even Tom Cruise couldn't rouse any feelings of connection or empathy with his character and I found it was rather predictable - Hollywood. I remember thinking about what I was going to write for my review whilst watching it (never a good sign) and thinking that it was a hi-tech, hi-budget version of low-budget 80s films like Solar Babies or Steel Dawn but with aliens.The film plot didn't exactly make sense, I could see what it was trying to do but there were plot holes the size of a small asteroid, and what did make sense in terms of understanding was just silly and I didn't care and I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Even Morgan Freeman wasn't giving it 100% and the rest of the cast seemed to be very inexperienced - acting my numbers. The acting was pretty hammy or wooden and nothing about the film felt original; Independence Day was heavily ripped off. The end was without any surprises and over all I was left unimpressed and that the entire film experience was pointless and there was no allegory which might have made it more relevant. There were enjoyable bits I guess, a pleasing flash back to Top Gun, a few laughs with Bob - the bobble-head - and visually it looked good, and Cruise playing Cruise is likable, nice future-tech and a beautiful swimming pool, but I wasn't emotionally involved in the film at all and it just seemed like a long music video or disjointedly connected set piece scenes. Why the name Oblivion?This film could have been so much better, more tense and poignant.",Oblivion
170,kgprophet,"Same problems as the overly complicated ""Prometheus""",5,19 April 2013,"I was ready to look up who wrote the script for this film, because there are the same problems with this film that plagued ""Prometheus"". I don't even know where to begin with what's wrong with this film. Aspects of this science fiction reality aren't explained, or worse, when they are explained, don't make any sense. Both films repeatedly throw a new wrinkle into the story, that you perhaps believe will lead to some big revelation, but only accomplishes creating more unanswered questions. Another similarity to the other film is the production design. The epic landscapes are good looking. Our main characters' home looks a little like the Jetsons' home, with slick looking technology. I spent the drive home from the theatre trying very earnestly to figure out the plot. This is the kind of movie where a plot twist, intended to keep the audience on it's toes, negates the actions made by a major character earlier. To make complaints about the story, one has to talk about spoilers, so be warned...If Jack has memories of Julia being his wife, then why does Victoria kiss him like a spouse during the flashback on the Odyssey? That whole thing of who is the real wife and who is really Jack is kind of explained but is too convoluted by that point to have any real emotional impact or meaning to the audience. What was the whole point of the robot aliens destroying Earth? The only thing I could kind of recall was that maybe those huge water convertors were actually for creating energy for the robot aliens, or something like that. A major question that came to mind was the premise of the underground surviving humans. Morgan Freeman is basically a cameo appearance in this film, the whole underground world of the surviving humans that he leads is given no screen time. On reflection, I think the screenwriter left that area unexplored in order to keep it as a 'mystery' to the audiences. I figured out the supposed aliens were really human within the first 20 minutes, so the potential for more exposition in their lives was lost. Instead long periods of time are spent following Jack going about his chores, along with the visit to his 'special place', a mountain retreat unharmed by the global annihilation. The central explanation of why Jack and Victoria exist and what is found on the mother ship is almost laughable. A non-feeling robot ruler (""Sally"") would not go through so much trouble to get rid of the last humans, and worse, have the same friggin' weakness that not only acted as the super-dumb climax to ""Phantom Menace"", but copied again more recently in ""Battle: LA"". Ugh! You not only copy a big climax used twice before, but it is a weak idea for a resolution in the first place! Please, a smart robot would make the drones autonomous, and be able to function without the mothership. Frankly, I could go on with spoilers for a few more paragraphs, but it would not help make any more sense out of Oblivion. Too much is tossed into the story without much inspiration behind it. It is only Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise that keeps any energy going. The music suffers some of the similar problems with the director's last film ""Tron: Legacy"", there is too much throbbing pop music to the sound at times when simpler more tense underscoring would have helped. It is composed by the band M83 instead of Daft Punk, but you could have fooled me. Mainly, because both bands seemed to be under the director's orders to make it sound like the generic Hans Zimmer busy strings from ""The Dark Knight"".Alas, I must blame this director who has a wonderful vision to his last two films, but lacks any true momentum within the acting, editing, and more importantly pacing. If you are a science fiction buff, I suggest see this film once on the big screen (I took some critics advice and saw it in Imax) to enjoy the nice visuals, but otherwise forget about ever wanting to sit through it again.",Oblivion
171,dvc5159,2013: A Cruise Recall,6,20 April 2013,"No sooner pass the one-hour mark, does Joseph Kosinski's ""Oblivion"" turns from an intriguing sci-fi premise into a ""guess the other sci-fi movie winks"" game. It was a bit of a letdown, having so much potential and then letting the screenplay take the easy way out, by catering to the audience. A superior screenwriter would have explored some of the interesting idea to its extent. Here we are treated to a slick, slam- bang futuristic actionier that treads on familiar territory but looks and sounds fantastic.If you got something, go for broke. This is only Kosinski's second feature film after the equally visually spectacular ""TRON: Legacy"", and he goes for broke with the visual effects and design of the movie. There is an awesome sense of scale and sights of breathtaking spectacle throughout the movie, and I'm not just talking about the action sequences - most of the film's establishing shots will make some hairs stand in awe. And unlike today's CGI-laden films from MTV directors, with choppy editing and all; Kosinski wants his audience to appreciate and savor the effects, so we get them in long, wide shots with a patient duration.If there ever was a director as visually creative and epic in his use of effects, Kosinski may be the go-to guy for such a movie, seeing that James Cameron or George Lucas may be busy with other projects. Hell, it's clear Kosinski cares about how his movie looks, and basically you get more than the price of the IMAX admission. Yes, the IMAX version is the way to go for this one. I simply cannot imagine seeing this movie again on a smaller screen. The visually stunning world Kosinski has created is worth more than the price of the IMAX edition alone.Alas, if only the script were as daring as its visual scale. It's based on Kosinski's own graphic novel, and I've counted major influences from ""Total Recall"", Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" and Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", among a few others. Yes, the ending is simplified Hollywood pap, but the visual journey to there has been nothing short of amazing. Hell, at least Kosinski has the gall to put in references to Kubrick and Tarkovsky, so it's all good. And Tom Cruise as the engineer Jack Harper, reminds me of those good-looking, manly heroes from the golden years of science fiction - handsome, intelligent, and ready to act when necessary, with Olga Kurylenko supplying enough weight for her obligatory love interest role. Even Morgan Freeman shows up to prove he ain't just wise, he can kick ass too.It appears the trailers have revealed far too much of the visuals. I simply do not understand the marketing for films today. Do they want to market the movie, or show you most of it just so you can pay 11 bucks to see the ending? I wisely avoided watching the trailer (although I heard them) and it allowed me to imagine what kind of visuals that may come up on the screen. Needless to say, I was not disappointed with what I saw.",Oblivion
172,TheMarwood,Doesn't have an original idea in its entire bloated running time,4,6 June 2014,"After a studio bidding war for director Joseph Kosinski's incomplete graphic novel, I can only image the pitch he gave - a mash up of every damn sci-fi film, some Wall-e, visual cues from 2001, Independence Day, Planet of the Apes, Blade Runner and so on. Oblivion is a tedious experience that just makes you want to revisit the much better films it borrows from. Tom Cruise is in his comfort zone here, and he's fine enough playing a typical Tom Cruise character. As evidenced from his previous film, Kosinski can't direct women or write for women, he just takes some generic hotties and projects some immature inner geek onto them either being bad-asses or just eye candy. It's always nice to see babes with perfect hair and lipstick and make-up running around in an apocalyptic setting. Morgan Freeman provides some much needed comedy in this otherwise dour film, though it should be noted that comedy is unintentional and his performance ranks up there with his previous sci-fi film Dreamcatcher. The film is slick looking, but relatively bland and the art direction looks like it took cues from an over sized apple store. There is some nice location work, with some CG elements carefully blended in, but beyond that, there's very little to recommend in Oblivion.",Oblivion

Tom cruise is either getting better at the acting or i'm starting to like him a lot more. Oblivion takes place in the future the moon was destroyed by an alien race that wanted to ravage Earth for our resources. We won the war but lost the Earth. Now Earth is orbited by Man's new home a large space station. And the Earth is inhabited by two people Jack Harper and his partner Victoria. their job is to make sure the Drones put in place to protect the large energy processing plants are running and the plants that are harnessing fission energy for the station are running properly. they have two weeks to go before they can leave this radioactive hulk called the earth. But Jack is having strange dreams that feel like memories. And things are starting to feel strange. When Drones start disappearing and Mutant scavengers called scavs are attacking the drones and stealing them and one of the plants is destroyed. Jack is starting to realize things are not what they seem. when a ship crashed and a army of drones kills the survivors except one. Suddenly Jack has more questions then answers when the lone survivor is the woman haunting his memories. And when the Scavs kidnap him and expose him to a startling truth. Jack suddenly realizes he's running out of time. they all are. They all have one chance to escape Oblivion. Can Jack believe his eyes and ears long enough to find out the truth and who can he trust?Well done film a shining example of what Scince fiction should be.,Oblivion
175,Meven_Stoffat,Rule number one of Oblivion: You do not talk about Oblivion.,9,21 April 2013,"Second rule of Oblivion: You do not talk about Oblivion.Alright, I hate to rip off the excellent Fight Club, but I felt that really sums up the film perfectly. Because it's impossible to talk about this film without really spoiling it; as I was telling my parents about it last night after having gone to see an matinée IMAX showing with my sister, I found myself having to hold back. Basically, you can only give them a description of what happens in the trailer and not spoil it. So while the fact that I'm trying to write a review of a film that's full of stuff which can't be given away may seem like an impossible task, what I can tell you is that this is simply a must see film.Joseph Kosinski's sophomore film effort after the stellar TRON: Legacy was a passion project of him since 2005; when Kosinski moved to Los Angeles looking for film/music video projects, he kept himself sane by writing an 8-page story about Jack Harper, a drone repairman in a post-apocalyptic New York. While writing it, he listened then- unknown French electronic musician Anthony ""M83"" Gonzales. For 6 years he tried to get the film made, and now it's finally here. And it's not a film for everyone, based on the reactions to it: some people will not like it, some people will love it, and some will be left wondering what to think about it. But one thing we can agree on is that it is one of the most ambitious films of the year, and maybe even in a long time. Shooting the film with Sony CineAlta cameras and having M83 score the film just adds to the cleverness of the film- for one, the film looks and sounds ahead of its time. M83's score is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer and Mike Oldfield with a futuristic twist, and the cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous. In particular, the pool scene looks like a pretty screen saver. It's wonderful.Right from the first frames of Oblivion, one can tell that it's a lot more intimate than most blockbusters out there. Same can be said for the opening bits where Jack Harper gets his plane ready and his wife sits in the control tower and sets base up. It definitely seems grand and epic, but at the same time, we're getting a lot more of an up-close- and-personal portrait of a couple paired together after a war that caused a huge disaster worldwide. Throughout much of the film we follow Jack as he repairs drones for the big robotic guardian in the sky named TET, and maintains the stability of the apocalyptic wasteland that is New York. He is almost always surrounded by danger, whether in the form of stray dogs or people dressed in creepy looking suits that resemble the creatures from the film ""Predator"". He does, at one point, notice a ship crashing and rescues a survivor, who seems to be hidden in his dreams a lot. From there on things get a lot stranger, and that's where I can stop telling you about the general gist of the film. I'll admit that I was a tad disappointed that the trailer gave away a lot of what happens in the film, and so if you have only seen the one trailer, I'd definitely recommend you leave it at that. Because the rest of the movie has lots of shocking twists and turns; great character changes and lots of secrets that will definitely surprise you. Of course, the buildup to the big climax at the end gets greater and greater as it goes on, and the payoff is ultimately very satisfying and emotional. Of course I do have a few small gripes about the film- the finish definitely seems a bit rushed, the film definitely seems familiar at times (with obvious plot elements from The Giver, Minority Report and The Book of Eli), and  a little more development of Jack's little hideout wouldn't have hurt, but overall, the film was really a stellar sophomore effort from Joseph Kosinski, and definitely will get itself a much deserved cult following. I can definitely imagine it being a film that will benefit from multiple viewings. The performances are excellent, especially from Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, who at times seems just plain creepy. The story is very thought provoking and will definitely leave you thinking about it long after the film is over, and the score is nothing short of stellar, and deserves to be heard on its own.So by all means, see it, and recommend it to your friends and family. But like I said, do not, by any means, give anything away for them.",Oblivion

181,badajoz-1,Cruise Tries but Very Predictable,3,25 April 2013,"Tom Cruise gives it everything, but ultimately cannot make too much of a storyline/writer/director, who is more interested in big sets and oh so clichéd familiar plot, that he has to put big messages out there so the thickest member of the audience can follow a not very complex story. So what is the story? Post-apocalypse Earth, devastated by inter-stellar war, has been abandoned, leaving the odd drone repairman and sidekick to keep huge fusion from water collectors harvesting the last of Earth's resources to be sent after the population who have decamped to Titan (cue reference to '2001' - and they keep coming! Unfortunately Tom's drone repairman character (not to be confused with Wall-E), Jack Harper, suffers from that Hollywood complaint - dreams and memories (despite a memory wipe!)cue 'Total Recall.' The dream involves a sexy young Olga Kuralyenko - so Jack's sidekick, the more robotic Andrea Riseborough, despite kit off antics and lovemaking in the pool in the skies, is on a hiding to nothing! The plot hinges on mysterious creatures called Scavs (the losers in the war) trying to lure Jack down into the depths (cue 'The Time Machine' Morlocks) and attracting a passing space ship with a signal from the shattered Empire State building! Cue all sorts of 'Planet of the Apes' tropes and 'Day After Tomorrow' visuals, where lo and behold out pops Tom's dreamgirl, who refuses to explain herself in case she gives away the plot half an hour too soon! I'll say no more about the plot, except to say I decided to go to the loo in a quiet moment - the sign of a mediocre movie- and came back to find Tom Cruise having a fist fight with Tom Cruise! Um. the obvious reason for knowing that not everything is right with this world from the word 'go' is that after a so-called nuclear war New York is not polluted with radiation, to be followed by the library episode (cue 'Day After Tomorrow') still having dry books after floods and earthquakes - there is also a pinch from 'Zardoz' with a book left for the droneman to read!!!!!!!!!!! I could go on....

People who love and know the magnificent Tron Legacy soundtrack will notice a certain resemblance here, but this is certainly not a bad thing, rather the opposite.

If anyone has ever seen the great (Though not well known) ""Moon,"" they will see ""Oblivion"" as a pure rip off. As I did.Cruise is obviously hoping no ones seen it.

Guarding these plants are a series of mechanical drones which, like the ED 209 robot enforcer in ""RoboCop,"" are lethal, and can also fly at incredible speeds and are virtually invincible.Harper is a drone repair specialist in a sector that contains the ruins of New York City, who along with Victoria (Andrea Riseborough, ""Disconnect"") man a luxury sky-high apartment (no, this isn't the Jefferson's) while spending several months on duty. In addition to fixing the machines, he sometimes has to battle rogue insect-like aliens (known as Scavs) who are intent on sabotaging as many of the drones as they can.It's pretty basic stuff, but, of course in a film like this, nothing is what it seems. While on a patrol, he discovers a beeping beacon located within the ruins of the Empire State building and then the crash of a strange spacecraft - with human cargo, mainly Julia (Olga Kurylenko, ""Seven Psychopaths""). Later, he is trapped by a group of Scavs who are also not who they seem to be.We are then introduced to Morgan Freeman (""Olympus Has Fallen"") and a group of war survivalists who did not make the trip to Titan, as well as a few more surprises. Movie borrows heavily from the 2003 remake of ""Solaris,"" as well as ""Minority Report,"" ""Clone Wars,"" ""Planet Of the Apes,"" ""Moon,"" and ""Total Recall,"" among others.Based on the comic book (or graphic novel, if you will) by Kosinski and Arvid Nelson, the story has been told before, but is given a leg up with good performances by Cruise and Freeman and a delightfully low key evil take by mission control leader, ""Sally"" (Oscar winner Melissa Leo, ""The Fighter"").Production values are also first-rate, with art direction by Joseph Bahran (""The Inclination: Zombie Invasion""), production design by Darren Gilford (""TRON: Legacy"") and cinematography by Academy Award winner (""Life Of Pi"") Claudio Miranda. The film looks spectacular with vast deserts, massive ruins of familiar locations, a devastated moon still in orbit and even a lush green oasis in the middle of all this destruction.Even with a thin story and some cliché situations, ""Oblivion"" is a worthwhile installment in the genre, certainly much better than recent efforts, including the over-hyped ""Prometheus"" and the awful-looking upcoming production, ""AfterEarth.""",Oblivion
186,nesfilmreviews,"Entertaining, but neither unique or exceptional.",6,24 July 2013,"While visually arresting and primed with action-sequences, ""Oblivion"" compromises its technical accomplishments with a disheveled script that helps itself liberally from numerous science fiction films. That being said, that doesn't mean that much of it's audience won't find this fairly engaging and entertaining. Tom Cruise returns to the realms of science fiction, collaborating with director Joseph Kosinski ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010), in a big screen adaptation of his unpublished graphic novel. Like a great deal of science fiction films, ""Oblivion"" requires a lengthy prologue in order to contextualize the viewer to the imaginative world they are being introduced to. In this case, that world is actually our own, just not at all like we know it. In 2077, 60 years after an alien invasion triggered a nuclear war that decimated the planet, the human race has all but abandoned Earth for Titan, the largest of Saturn's moons. Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper, one of the last few drone repairmen stationed on an Earth which has been abandoned for years following decades of war with a group known as the Scavs. Along with his wife Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), they maintain the fleet of drones, protecting the earth from the threat of the Scavs. Yet, when a series of drones go down, and a spaceship crashes with a beautiful survivor Julia (Olga Kurylenko) on board, Jack finds his life changed forever as everything he knows, (or thinks he knows), is blown apart.""Oblivion"" is an incredible piece of visual sci-fi eye candy; sleek, a wonderfully realized world of day-after-tomorrow style technology, including some brutally intense fight sequences. It's one of those films that demands it to be watched on the biggest screen you can possibly find. The world ""Oblivion"" paints is certainly a striking one, but the emptiness that now dominates the planet inevitably also permeates throughout the picture itself. This is the underlining problem with ""Oblivion."" The movie comes off as merely a derivative of other well-done, successful science fiction films. So much creativity went into the visual design that apparently little was left when crafting the plot. The movie liberally borrows from ""WALL-E"" (2008), ""Total Recall"" (1990), ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), and ""Moon"" (2009), that it often veers dangerously close into lawsuit territory.""Oblivion"" is admirable in its look and style, but the film is not unique or exceptional. It holds its own as the mystery initially plays out, and you do find yourself drawn in, but as the pieces begin to slot together, you can't help but feel you've seen it all before.

187,daniewhite-1,Oblivious to sense,4,20 August 2020,'Oblivion' stands as a stark example of fiction with big brains for a big idea but little sense for a development and delivery of that idea.As such the first half works as a memorably put together sci fi-mystery film with bare photography and impressively bold production design.After that it descends into oblivion: hero exploits twaddle lashed to an utterly irredeemable and unintelligible piffle of a narrative. Incredible and unworthy.Imo a complete shame because I found the first hour likable and engaging and I was willingly following the narratives progression.I rate 4/10 thanks to the interesting opening act however I can only really recommend to film fans who only watch the first half of a film and then make up their own endings.

It's really almost impossible to review it in any detail without giving away spoilers but I will say this, Oblivion is one of my favorite science-fiction films of all-time. It isn't over the top, it doesn't try to do too much, it just relies on fantastic acting thanks to protagonist Jack Harper, played by Tom Cruise, along with a fantastic supporting cast and a story that is absolutely amazing. The plot developed at a perfect pace for the environment and created a setting that felt genuine throughout. The only flaw was that there were some elements left unexplained, but then again it is a sci-fi movie so it doesn't take too much from the experience. I don't understand why so many critics slammed this movie but they do tend to like weird, artsy fartsy garb and dislike anything resembling a well-made action film. While this movie didn't have much action, it seems like it does from trailers so don't expect a gung-ho modern shooter or anything. If anything, it feels more like a Matrix style film in terms of pace. Regardless, I've said as much as I can say without revealing too much.

Which is a problem as this movie is trying to be one about hope, where we care whether the people survived.I found I could care less.The story has an interesting premise. Unfortunately it doesn't grow a decent plot. The script is basic cut and paste. If you are more than twelve years old it will seem like one cliché after another.On the positive side of things the CGI (all of the visuals) are very well done. The Star Wars clichéd chase scene is a clichéd and shortcoming of the story, rather than of the people in charge of the visuals.The music is stirring and uplifting and one of the best for a long time. But, as a movie, it's just average. A straight-to-DVD kind of outing with an over-sized budget.",Oblivion
191,ripcords,Excellent,9,25 July 2020,"One of the more enjoyable Sci-Fi flicks of the decade. The initial sets (green screens) are clean and bright. They actually make you want to be there. The story is entertaining and, though familiar, is done with enough elan to make the film enjoyable. Cruise at his best here.",Oblivion
192,harrylosborne,An under-appreciated sci-fi gem,8,18 June 2019,"Do not be fooled by the premise of Tom Cruise in a futuristic post-apocalypse world: Oblivion is a sci-fi film of genuine quality and visual prowess, succeeding where a dearth of productions have tried (and failed) before. Oblivion does not require constant fight scenes and dramatic set pieces to hold the attention of the viewer, but instead delicately constructs an interesting story around the obscure history of conflict that has destroyed Earth. Jack (Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are two of the few survivors, veterans tasked with extracting the last of Earth's resources to power the remnants of humanity; however, they must also tackle the alien presence still lingering on the ground, who are intent on disrupting their efforts. When an unidentified ship crashes back on Earth without warning, the two are sent into a spiral of confusion around who can be trusted - and whether their memories have stood the test of time.Oblivion's mastery comes through their development of each character's loneliness: Jack and Victoria's only other human contact is a satellite link to their mothership off-world, amplifying the lack of empathy their job entails. The explorer of the two, Jack, has a hidden retreat in one of the safe zones on Earth (unbeknownst to Victoria); this example of the lack of complete transparency shows the seeds of doubt in both of the humans - fated to be able to trust nobody else, but still sceptical of every decision. Jack is also haunted by memories from before Earth's demise, constantly lingering but hidden from his partner. Director Joseph Kosinski's vision of a depleted Earth is hauntingly beautiful, a stark expanse awash with greys and blues, devoid of life. In direct contrast, the crew's machinery is precise and clean, bright white droids tasked with eliminating anything not perceived as human.Without giving too much away, the storyline's ability to open up and challenge the audience makes Oblivion a more rewarding film than it's given credit for; Cruise acts well throughout, exhibiting more empathy than he's known for showing. The score from French electronic outfit M83 is the ideal accompaniment for the mysterious nature of the wasteland, and does a fantastic job of building each scene without using music typical of the sci-fi genre. Oblivion will surprise those who wouldn't normally consider this their style of film, but is more than just a run-of-the-mill futuristic thriller.",Oblivion
193,Tcarts76,Not too horrible,7,24 July 2013,"OK, I give oblivion a 7. I came into the movie only knowing a couple of things. 1. It was a Sci-Fi movie about a ""future"" earth. 2. Tom Cruise was in it.Visually it was a pretty good movie. The effects are pretty good, and Sci Fi is usually pretty big on that stuff, so nothing wrong with it there. The story, well, there are a lot of people that are going to hate on it because of the obvious Tom Cruise/Scientology connection, but what ever, it wasn't too bad, and was somewhat entertaining.There have been a lot of people that say this movie was too long. I didn't mind. The problem I had was 2 fold. First, I had the whole movie and storyline figured out in the first 15-20 minutes of the movie. The disguised nothing and that sucks...no big surprises. Second, The acting was bad. Tom Cruise is not a great actor but he was OK in this one, But the supporting actors (which there were only really 2) were pretty much bad. Olga Kurylenko is a beautiful girl but this role was completely bad and flat. Andrea Riseborough really added no value as well. Morgan Freeman is just as unimpressive. I know, everybody thinks he is the greatest actor in the world...but he has been known to do some very bad movies.All in all, for a Sci Fi flick, it's decent. With all my complaining I can still give it a 7, and it would beat that god awful ""The Host"" hands down any day of the week.",Oblivion
194,GeoPierpont,Ping Pong Ball Bad Guys only LIGHTER!,5,3 December 2014,"Spaceballs, a sci-fi comedy, has nothing on this masterpiece. I could not stop laughing when the drones appeared, who came up with this visual, let alone the R2D2 sounds? The super high tech TeT Commander can't even get a decent transmission and was always on the 'fritz. I loved Melissa Leo, what a departure from her typical Southern sweetness, oh wait...Tommy had me at ""Risky Business"" and his performance fell just as flat. Apologies, I know how hard you work at your craft. Maybe when you are 60 we can get a little more lateral motion.Olga HotBabe is stunning with so many head shots of her emoting, er sleeping, and were beautiful. I am guessing she is the new Angelina, but no comparison on the acting level, she just seemed scared and uncomfortable during the film. Can hardly blame her sidling up to the Big Boys.The scene that provided the highest entertainment value was the Scav Torture Chamber. Now, when you are desperate for a drone flyer and there is only ONE, what do you do? You smash him to bits, tie him up, flame the Draqnet bright lights on him and recite poetry, gots to end on a polite note. My friends, it doesn't get any better than this.Enjoyed the Zep tune on the grassy knoll, and other musical inputs. However, the sound was so disjointed, i.e. dialog barely a whisper, action scenes cranked up 1000%, constantly had to adjust the volume, unclear if that was an editing problem.I guess the crowning achievement is that our man hooks up with two major hotties, take that Katy! Recommend for pure comedy, especially if you are a big sci-fi fan.",Oblivion
195,TheOny13,Very good sci-fi flick! (No spoilers),9,11 February 2018,"I was planning to watch this movie for a long while, actually ever since it came out in 2013. This movie tells the story of Jack Harper who does repairs and cleaning up in a post-apocaliptic world. As he progresses through the movie layers of his story come out and that makes for an interesting movie.This movie was surprisingly received very poorly by the critics when it was released saying that it's the classic case of style over substance. I actually find to have many layers and a lot of character depth. The visuals are stunning and is sad to see that this movie didn't got nominated for an Oscar in 2014 for visuals. They are combined very well sometimes with beautiful landscapes that makes for a fantastic visual experience. But that's not the only thing this movie does right. The characters as the story develops have a lot more layers and depth than you might think at the beginning. The performances are pretty good especially from Tom Cruise who carries this movie forward, but also the rest of the cast do a good job in the screen time they have. The story is really good and at times full of mysterys and intrigue. There is one thing that bothered me and it was the fact that the story tried at times to be to much for the movie or for the pace it had. That meant some less screen time for certain characters that might seem promising or interesting at first. Another thing that I didn't like was that the story overall had some circumstance and motives lacking from some of the situations presented. I was constantly ""it's good, but I would want more"". That would have maybe involved me more into the story and in the movie. Apart from that the story has emotion and humanity at it's core and that is what I liked about it. It was about the characters while using a sci-fi scenario and it was something that you could relate to and have a message sent towards you with which you could remain with by the end of the movie. By the way the ending was beautiful but somewhat short. I mean I would have wanted a bit more explanations and more connections to be tied up by the end. But that didn't ruin the excitement I had overall with the movie. One last thing I'll mention is that the tech seemed very futuristic and realistic for a sci-fi but that is somewhat of an understatement for all the new sci-fi movies nowadays.Overall a very good movie with great visuals, good enough story good performances and fine characters that intrigue as much as entertain the audience. 9/10",Oblivion
196,JaydoDre,A deceptive experience,6,5 March 2017,"The moment this movie signaled a sharp downhill turn for me was when two people were fighting over a gun and the gun accidentally went off, while another person was observing the fight from relatively far away. Instantly, this made me think of a trope that a number of action movies from the 90s and 80s used, in which a stray gunshot like this would accidentally hit someone important to the main hero, but my mind pushed that memory away, as I was sure that this smart movie would not stoop so low as to use such a cliché. Sure enough, a moment later it was revealed that the observer got shot. Even worse, this person was apparently unaware of getting shot at first, which also happens in action movies sometimes, but makes little sense in a situation like this.The clean bright look of the machines, the architecture and characters' wardrobes, as well as a potent sci-fi soundtrack, make you feel like you are watching something original and intelligent, but as the movie progresses, you may realise that this is a Frankenstein's monster, patched together from a number of other older movies and games (Portal specifically), wrapped in a fresh package.On top of that, as the story progresses, it raises a few important questions that never get answered, thereby creating plot holes that make the plot feel unrealistic and dumb. And while this is not a very wordy movie, much of the dialogue that's there is not great. There is a lot of exposition through talking instead of showing and there are meaningless one-liners that are only there because they sound cool.Therefore, Oblivion goes from a seemingly interesting promise to an increasingly disappointing dumb action movie. It does look good all the way through and there are a few cool sci- fi turns, so at least there is that.",Oblivion

The film is carried by Tom Cruise. He is the film. The film's pace is very slow. In fact, it takes 45 minutes to an hour before any real action begins to take place. The film reminded me of the strategy in Independence Day whereby the alien ship was destroyed from within except that in this one, the deliverers of the bomb don't make it out. This is a prime time movie. It is not really a family film, although young teens and older might also enjoy the film. Younger children might get confused with all the clones running around. Bring the popcorn and break out the soda for this film. Enjoy.",Oblivion
198,datorsiers2,Tom Cruise was actually great in this one.,6,6 December 2014,"By reading the reviews i only saw some positive opinions about the movie overall, i don't know, if it is only me, but i watched it and didn't feel any emotions or whatever. In my opinion the plot was really dull, for a science fiction movie like this there should be way more action.Morgan Freeman also had a very insignificant role, he literally didn't do anything, despite him being the head of the survivor base, for an actor of his caliber, i was disappointed to see him in a role like that.Despite the movie not being entertaining for me, i really like Tom Cruise's acting in this movie, that and some of the beautiful movie were the 2 aspects, that made me even continue watching it, because at the beginning i was quite bored already and the ending wasn't a shocker at all, as well.Maybe sci-fi fans love this movie, just not really my cup of tea, anyways 6/10.",Oblivion

200,JohnWelles,"An Extended, Overlong Homage to '70s Sci-Fi Films.",6,4 May 2013,"""Oblivion"" (2013), directed by Joseph Kosinski, who previously made ""Tron: Legacy"" (2010), is an extended homage to science fiction films in the 1970s. The script, by Kosinksi and Oscar-winner William Monahan with uncredited touch-ups by Michael Arndt, appears to be an amalgam of a disparate batch of films, from ""Logan's Run"" (1976) and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) to ""Solaris"" (1972) and ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968). This similarity with sci-fi films of the past paradoxically is both its major strength and weakness.In reinvention of iconic scenes, such as black and white flashbacks to New York echoing Gilliam's ""Twelve Monkeys"", its use of design with immaculate white, angular flying Bubble Ships and living quarters, we are given some stunningly beautiful, perfectly envisioned concepts. Claudio Miranda, who won the Academy Award for ""Life of Pi"" (2012), shoots the landscapes on location in Iceland, breathtakingly utilising the widescreen to maximum effect.However, films are more than a collection of attractive shots edited together; they have plot, characters, direction. For a futuristic film, the ideas element is all the more prescient and this is where ""Oblivion"" falters. Too little is new or resembling originality. Anyone well-versed in cinema will see where the twists are coming and none of the characters, despite a good cast including Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman, connect and engage. Cruise's character in particular doesn't work well enough; the writing is too generic and not insightful enough, a disaster when the film pivots around him.Kosinski's direction displays his variable talent, his penchant for framing sequences to best effect and building up a vivid sense of geography. Yet the people in his shots flounder, the character ""moments"" not hiding his disinterest compounded by the story's weaknesses. Pacing too is an issue with Kosinski and his editor Richard Francis-Bruce struggling to find a proper rhythm to the film. Some scenes are much too long, others are seemingly abandoned, meaning that even at a mere two hours long, the movie feels a drawn out affair.If ""Oblivion"" is imperfect, when it does work, Kosinksi is shown to be a director who has skill, can direct complex technical scenes and has a kinetic way with action. It is his abandonment of actors, intended or not, that undercuts his efforts. The film finally, despite looking very good, is less than the sum of its parts.",Oblivion
201,tr91,"Visually amazing, very enjoyable.",8,28 August 2013,"'Oblivion' was a film that kept me gripped from the 1st minute. The set is just visually amazing, everything about it is stunning. The way the Earth looks, the vehicles, the bubble ship (where Jack lives) all just looked brilliant. The special effects were amazing too. I really am struggling for words to describe just how good it did look.The cast all done a great job, Tom Cruise was pretty much perfect in the lead role and then there was Morgan Freeman, who I wish could have had more screen time. Then there was two lesser known actresses, Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko who both gave very good and believable performances.I thought the plot was good and as I said before, it got your attention right from the start. The action scenes were breathtaking and extremely fast paced when they happened. Some have said that they felt the film was too long, I personally felt it was the right length because it enabled the characters to develop. It was a little bit predictable at times and did get a bit confusing when there was a twist, although it all made more sense in the end.Overall, this was a very enjoyable film that is just simply stunning on the eye.8/10.",Oblivion
202,kunalkhandwala,A medley of sci-fi themes ruin a promising plot,7,2 May 2013,"It has been sixty years since the alien invaders destroyed our moon causing Earth's devastation through fierce natural forces. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is left with a barren wasteland of a planet where he is tasked with the repair of drones and elimination of scavengers who had supposedly attacked Earth. While his routine, insipid life with work/bed partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) is partly directed by Sally from the mission control aboard space station TET, Jack finds his roots upon the Earth that once was. He frequently escapes into a verdant valley where an old cottage has his collectibles and his peace, while his fragmented memory draws images of a woman upon the Empire State building. It is not until the sudden appearance of that woman who claims to be his wife and their subsequent capture by the scavengers who turn out to be the remaining human population, that he discovers that nothing is as it seems upon the planet. This fragmented memory and the wiping out of Earth's civilization into oblivion has another reality that director Joseph Kosinski ('Tron:Legacy') presents with stunning visuals and pulsating action but neglects the development of an original twist. Rather, he concocts several sci-fi movie themes into a dreary, predictable second half. 'Oblivion' had immense potential to be that epic sci-fi movie and along with its visual appeal, it justifies a matinée show viewing at the very least. High up in the stratosphere, Jack and Victoria live an alienated life that follows protocols dictated by Sally at the Mission control aboard the Steve Jobs designed TET space station. Victoria is motivated to join the other humans aboard TET on a voyage to Saturn's moon, Titan, to start a new life but Jack's indifference to it reflects his attachment to Earth and his hope of finding out the truth. While he was made to believe that after the Earth was attacked, humans won the war but lost the planet, he cannot seem to understand why the humans had to leave their home if they won the war.... Julia (Olga Kurylenko) survives the apocalypse in a space capsule, unconscious with life fluids, only to crash land back to Earth sixty years later. She is rescued from the blazes by Jack who recognizes her as the woman in his dreams. Just as he is informed that he was once married to her, they are captured by Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), the leader of the surviving human rebellion. He tries to convince Jack about the reality of the war and his existence but it takes Jack a daring mission into the radiation zone to discover the truth. Up until this point, Oblivion has a captivating sci-fi plot that offers no obvious clues about what really happened. Thereafter, Kosinski orchestrates a medley of themes from 'The Matrix', '2001: A space odyssey', 'Planet of the Apes', 'Prometheus', 'Blade Runner' and of course, 'Independence Day' into an uninspiring second half. Tom Cruise has backed many promising films that lacked a solid plot throughout and they have suffered their critical and monetary fates. Oblivion would have been his best sci-fi role since 'Minority Report' had there been a more coherent, novel plot to follow through. Performing most of his own stunts as always, Cruise has worked hard being Jack Harper and he does add whatever credibility the character can offer. Once again, he has noticeably stopped aging but that is merely a frivolous observation. Andrea Riseborough looks like a serious school teacher throughout; certainly not someone you want to see naked in the pool. Miss Olga Kurylenko adds more emotion than she did as a Bond girl but does little to add credibility to the character. Morgan Freeman looks quite badass in the Morpheus type goggles, dark cape and cigar in hand. His character needed more screen presence with perhaps an insightful past and action towards the future. His deeds are confined to the cave with little impact to the plot's conclusion. Claudio Miranda's (Life of Pi) cinematography depicts spectacular landscapes, skies and action sequences while the visual effects team delivers awe-inspiring elements that make this film a must-watch on the big screen. With a more than able cast and crew, Kosinski had potential to take Oblivion to greater heights but the lack of an original follow through and some heavily inspired sci-fi themes make the second half a predictable fantasy adventure. An audacious plot could've made better heroes of Earth's survivors and Tom Cruise's sci-fi outing would not have passed into Oblivion.7.002 on a scale of 1-10.",Oblivion
203,MickeyTheConstant,A Decent Sci-Fi Movie,7,7 January 2019,I quite enjoyed this movie. It was nothing overly original and I guessed some of the twists but even so I did enjoy it. Cruise was good in his role. Some of the others a bit wooden in their acting. The end was a bit cheesy also. There was a bit too much drone action which got a tad boring in the end and would have preferred to find out a bit more about the alien race trying to take over Earth but all in all it was a decent watch,Oblivion

Nothing Is What It Seems To Be plot, with at least two of these big reveals of things that are surprising.It is also Yet Another Post Apocalyptic movie.But, it all works. It's a perfectly good paranoia / soft SF concept thing, wrapped in a candy shell of hard SF devices and a few gunfights, all of which (okay, aside from a few bits of grandstanding like the first dive off the tower platform) are entirely integral to the plot.Not for a moment did I see anything where I thought that was dumb, or contrived. Several times I was entirely surprised at the turn it took; sure in retrospect you can see how that's a ""typical"" choice, but in film, it worked.Visuals are lovely. Great art direction that reminds me of the 70s era soft SF stuff, taken to a beautiful conclusion it is today. Entirely believable VFX, which is critical.

205,vailsy,a poor dollars spent / movie quality ratio,5,6 April 2014,"I actually quite like Tom Cruise and am not a Cruise-basher, I also like sci-fi, but this movie failed for me on a number of counts The pacing is bad and there is no build up or developed back story, instead the audience is thrown straight into the middle of it all. It's obvious very early on who the bad people are going to be and where things will end up, and because Oblivion is also quite long, things get boring The special effects are nice for the most part, but the drones get repetitive after a while. it has some nice sound, but really nothing exceptional. It reminded me a little bit of Lost in Space from 1998, big budget bland sci-fi There are some badly wasted actors such as Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jamie Lanister from Game of Thrones) who is given about 2 lines to speak, the ultimate crime in my opinion because he would probably be a better lead than Cruise himself The female lead Olga Kurylenko is extremely limited and one dimensional, and spends most of her screen time glaring at Tom Cruise like he is some kind of god figure Oblivion tries to be everything at once.. complex sci-fi conspiracy movie, action, romance, but ends up lacking in all departments There are so many better things to watch in this genre both on the big screen and on TV, including the previous Cruise/Sci-fi outings Minority Report and War of the Worlds, both are better than Oblivion.

This film comes close to being a very well rounded film, but it is missing a bit of depth but it more then makes up for it in action and story. Tom Cruise has had another film that felt like this one, Minority Report, it had the same eerie feeling of being watched and of impeding doom. The one lacking part of the movie is the human survivors who are found, they are not developed very much and Morgan Freeman is little used, but this actually is OK because they are not the center of the story. The creepy chosen wife, the Tom VS Tom fight, the ships and drones are all very cool.

207,achyutaghosh,"Oblivion movie review- beautiful, stylish, fantastic",9,14 April 2013,"Granted Oblivion takes inspiration from countless sci-fi classics,  granted that it lets a larger than life star consume it, granted it  lets visual flair and elegance triumph mind bending probabilities, but  there is no denying the fact that it is one hell of an entertainer, and  probably THE sci-fi vehicle that Tom Cruise wanted all his life,  Spielberg aside.  A long preamble sets the dystopian background- it is the year 2077, and  the earth has been devastated in a war with aliens who destroyed the  moon, thus destabilizing the earth, causing earthquakes and tsunamis.  Nuclear annihilation followed, and as the earth became inhabitable, the  surviving humans moved to Titan, a moon of Saturn, while alien  scavengers still roam the irradiated habitat. They still mine the  earth's resources through giant reactors which are in turn protected by  drones, which are maintained by a pair of technicians residing in a  stylish, minimalistic floating facility in the clouds, with wiped out  memories- Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea  Riseborough), who are counting their days to their return to Saturn. Is  this the truth? Who are Jack and Victoria? Why does Jack still have  haunting memories of his past? Are there humans left on earth? Who won  the war?  ""Is it possible to miss a place you've never been? To mourn a time you  never lived?""  Oblivion doffs it cap to gems such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, I am  legend, Independence Day, @Moon, Star Wars, Total Recall, The Matrix  and of course, WALLE to create a striking, visually resplendent  feature. Fresh from his Oscar for Life of Pi (film), Claudio Miranda  creates an another unforgettable integration of cinematography and  visual effects- an arresting landscape of desolate beauty pockmarked  with craters and fallen signposts of humanity as we know it, and lush,  unspoiled green valleys. The action is sporadic and effective, not  overpowering, and there is a love triangle that is sensitively dealt  with. Cruise here is playing one of his more affable characters, a  dreamer trying to find out the meaning of his existence, taking direct  inspiration from Sam Rockwell's stellar turn in the Moon. As  revelations unravel, he gets into superstar mode with minimal  fussiness- cool vehicles, check. Weapons, check. Beautiful babes,  check. Mission to save the world, check. Risenborough is superb as the  icy cool, rule following partner, Olga Kurylenko gives grace to an  essentially damsel in distress role, while Morgan Freeman is his usual  solid self in a cameo.   Director Joseph Kosinski gives a graphic novel flair to the  proceedings, and like his previous effort Tron Legacy, gives a solid  bonus in the form of a surging musical score by French band M83.To sum  up, Oblivion may not be terribly original, but it is stylish, well  written and got performances to boot- especially Cruise who is in red  hot form. It may not be a puzzle to solve, but in the immortal words of  Roxette- it's got the look to warrant a trip to the theaters! Go on and  enjoy a summer spectacle.",Oblivion
208,Come-and-Review,"Down rated, it's great!",10,22 September 2014,"Oblivion is really one of my favourite Sci-fi movies from the last decade, and I can't but praise it. The first wonderful thing about Oblivion is the visuals. They're just unordinary and wonderfully stunning. Watching this film in blu-ray quality is just appealing. The unusual post-apocaliptic depiction, next to the high tech shown presents an unusually working paradox. Story-wise, it is advisable to know as less as possible about the plot. While the movie is really modern, its plot is as good as some of the original 70s-80s films - just maybe with a different pace and surely with different visuals. Cast seems perfect in every way. They didn't need too many actors for this film, and they chose everyone just right for their role. There's not really so musch to be told. This movie is one of the rare cases I've rated a movie 10/10 without it being considered a masterpiece of a film. It just makes me hope for seeing Kosinski doing more films in the future.",Oblivion

The theme is accompanied by a suitably stark setting, with remnants of NYC sticking from a war-devastated ground.By the third act, the screenwriters have written themselves into a corner, and the plot falls apart. Let's see, if I am a human who KNOWS that the man fighting me is being deceived by an alien into thinking I am alien, I'll wear alien masks and distort my voice while fighting him, to make sure he thinks I AM an alien. If I am an alien who has been monitoring an erratically behaving human servant, of whom I have 1000s of clones in reserve, I'll fly him into my inner sanctum without checking his cargo. Etc. Such glaring logical flaws are easily forgiven in a low-brow action flick, but not in an sf film that has higher aspirations.I watched Toy Story 3 right after this upon recommendation of my son. What a paean to plot logic and character development by comparison. Similar concept: a hero thrust into a strange environment realizes that the seemingly good are in reality bad.

This is a story that happens to have some special effects instead of the other way around, which is nice to see for a change, since it's been awhile. The '80s were dappled with sci-fi movies with story and with heart and then they disappeared off the map until recently...though, most of the recent sci-fi films are all effects and little story. I'm actually surprised that the director of this film's first film was of that variety. I'm glad I didn't know the director's last film was 'Tron: Legacy,' otherwise, I probably would not have gone to see 'Oblivion,' or at least not be excited about it.I wasn't sure what to expect but the film met my expectations of measuring up. It wasn't a Disney animated film for adults, instead, it had substance. It kind of reminded me of the feel of 'I am Legend' but with a sci-fi spin. It had nice pacing, it was beautiful to look at, it had intrigue and mystery (though, I kind of knew the direction the film would go from the beginning...but it still had plenty of mystery to keep my interested). A lot of the film is based around the mystery, story, and the acting. And since they chose a great cast of actors it was easy to watch them and compelling. This is a film for true geeks and people who just like a good story. Knuckle draggers who crush beer cans with their foreheads and drive over-sized pickup trucks with knobby tires...this will probably not be their cup of tea...or PBR.

""Moon"" and ""Prometheus"" are the other ones, though one could argue that ""Moon"" isn't a big film in itself and ""Prometheus"" is weakest as a whole.Yes, Oblivion has elements and themes that we've already seen before. It doesn't invent anything perfectly fresh. It reminds me of 2-3 other movies very much. I'm not naming those movies though, this is best to be seen without any spoilers beforehand if at all possible. Even though the themes are not original, they work well and the movie feels it's set in its own world. Not only do the themes work well, but they are important and ageless. I managed to suspend my disbelief and dive into the movie, and I was rewarded. This isn't to say that the movie is sloppy or nonsensical, although many people will have problems with some things. What I mean is that there's much detail to every scene. I don't only mean props, continuity or stuff like that, but that every scene is crafted carefully and and has a purpose. I will compliment the ending too. Not necessarily in a ""it's brilliant!"" manner, but the movie made me feel there was a real payoff. It builds itself up well, holds itself together and ends in a powerful way. The ending was intense, emotional and absolutely satisfying. So I liked the general plot, themes and pacing. How does it look? It looks brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Those of you who have Prometheus on blu-ray: yes, this is equally stunning. I admit some designs lack imagination and many things are too ""clean"" as if futuristic surroundings would always be white, clean-cut and sterile, but you forgive that. This is eye-candy, this is eye-steak. Also, if you have a symmetry-related OCD, you'll appreciate Oblivion. For some reason I noticed symmetry everywhere.Everything seems to have its rightful place. And here I will also compliment the wonderful music: when everything works and flows well on the screen, you can easily concentrate your focus on the beautiful score too.Tom Cruise is a strange man. I would love to hate him for his scientology crap, but almost every time he entertains me with his movies. Many times he's just so solid. He's solid again. Not anything Oscar-worthy, but he does deliver as well as we've grown to expect. Beautiful Olga Kurylenko's character is one I would've liked to have developed a little more, but she gives a pretty good performance. Andrea Riseborough is excellent and in my mind delivers the best acting in this movie, establishing that certain important contrast with the main character. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman. That is enough.Except for a couple of short scenes, there are usually only 2-3 people interacting with each other at once - often with just communication devices - and I like it. It creates that weird feeling of intimacy in a vast, open world. For some reason I'm reminded of ""Collateral"", where Cruise and Jamie Foxx kind of have a huge city just to themselves.In some ways, this movie is like Prometheus for me, Oblivion being a little better as a whole. Both are a little flawed in their own ways, but still fascinating and captivating in a way that's very hard to accomplish. Add brilliant visuals and an effective soundtrack into the mix and you got yourself an interesting ride. I think I had the perfect state of mind for this movie, I'm still surprised how much I liked it.I do believe that in time, ""Oblivion"" will be a cult classic. There was so much wonderful talent involved in almost every possible aspect that I could almost sense their love for filmmaking as an art form.Joseph Kosinski did a really wonderful job and established himself for me. Really looking forward to his work from now on.",Oblivion
213,deastman_uk,Half Moon,6,14 April 2013,"Much of Oblivion is like Moon, which is good. Unfortunately, it also bears a sad resemblance to Independence Day in the tail.But it is encouraging that Hollywood can deliver a sci-fi film that focuses on writing and theme without wanting to warp into dysfunction like the dreadful Prometheus.The story telling reveals what is necessary, making the assumption that the fairly standard plot does not require too much explanation. The world is dead, and Tom Cruise plays a Wall-E type maintenance role, with lingering doubts.It is as if someone has discovered that if the plot is straight forward, less time is spent covering the holes. And while the feeble end is probably what is required for a studio to green light the popcorn, we have been given enough to be satisfied.",Oblivion

And one hour fifty minutes later as the credits rolled I was left feeling no different.It's obvious that piles of money were thrown at this project but to what end? The characters don't engage the emotions. The plot is utterly derivative and full of holes. The direction plods. It's a complete snooze.Tom Cruise looks old. The female actors provide little more than decoration. Morgan Freeman is employed (yet again) to add gravitas to a load of old bunkum (as he was in Olympus Has Fallen) and fails (again).The trailer had me hoping for a spectacular, firecracker of a film experience but all I got was a damp squib. Boring and disappointing. A waste of two (L-O-N-G) hours.Slow. Overly-long. Dull. Not recommended.",Oblivion
215,metalrage666,Finally a fresh looking Sci-Fi movie.,8,18 April 2013,"Recent Sci-Fi/Action movies have unfortunately left any kind of story sitting on the back seat, and they hope that all of the done-to-death special effects will carry it through to success, so I had some misgivings going into this movie despite the overall appeal of the preview. But this simply wasn't the case with this movie.As a Sci-Fi fan, I found the story to be quite fresh, given that the overall premise was of an post-apocalyptic Earth, it didn't have that bland or depressing barren wasteland feel that so many post war devastating movies have.The film starts in the year 2077. Sometime in 2017, (yes just 4 years away), our moon is attacked and left in a crumbled mess. This sudden change in the gravitational field creates earthquakes and tsunamis that devastate most of our planet. Humans apparently then deliver the coup-de-grace, by setting off their nuclear stockpile in retaliation to these attacks. Despite learning that man won the war, what's left is a permanently altered Earth and one that's no longer fit for habitation.Enter mans salvation, a large orbiting space station called the TET, (I assume it's called this due to it's shape, that of an immense tetrahedron). The TET is supposed to be a stepping stone we have created for our journey to our new home, Saturn's largest moon - Titan.In order to accomplish this and so our new home can support human life, huge water filtration plants are set up along the coastline of old New York. These plants are protected by a series of automated and powerful drones, equipped with infra-red, swivel cannons and heavy shielding. Tom Cruise is Tech 49 who's job it is to repair and maintain the drones as they are regularly attacked by remnants of those who attacked us, called Scavs, (short for scavengers), as they bring down these drones and then strip them of essential parts.At this point you think that this is just a simple movie of human survival, but the reality is far more insidious. The TET was not built by us, it was the TET that attacked us. The scavs, are what's left of the human race and their attacks on the drones are so they can stop this water filtration process. We find that the water is not for our future use, instead it's for an alien intelligence wanting to suck the earth dry of all it water resource.There are of course random undertones from other movies that followed this premise, such as ""V"" and more recently Independence Day. Tom Cruise and his assistant on Earth in 2077, are actually space shuttle pilots from 2017 that were sent to investigate the TET when it first arrived. In turn they were captured, had their memories erased and cloned. After Earth bit the dust, the clones were returned to various sectors on Earth so they can look after the water plants and the drones.The special effects in Oblivion are top notch as are the action scenes. I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise, but I didn't mind him in this, I thought he played the character well. The random scenes of a devastated U.S were incredibly well done, the CGI was not so obvious and for many scenes, in particular the now ground level observation deck of the Empire State building was incredible.If this type of movie appeals and you're a fan of decent Sci-Fi/action films then you'll want to see this again.",Oblivion
216,TheFilmGuy1,A Mix Of Cliché And Original That Works Out In The End,8,10 June 2014,"I had heard good things about this recently, saying that it was underrated, so I decided to check it out. I don't remember any raving reviews when it came out, so the sudden praise peaked my interest. I'm glad I checked it out.The film is an interesting mix of original ideas and clichés. One minute you will be intrigued by the plot, the next you'll be saying ""oh well I kinda thought that would happen"", but I think it's a film that remains more on the original side. Sure, you'll see some of you're typical Hollywood movie clichés that will make you think this film is going in a bad direction, but if you stick with it until the end, you will be pleased. This is quite a beautiful film at times. It has some mesmerizing shots that will leave you breathless. They help sell the futuristic feeling. But on the flip side, there can be some slightly boring and typical set pieces. The film kind of goes back and forth between inspired and unoriginal with it's visuals, but I think the good visuals left a bigger mark on me.Tom Cruise gives a good performance, showing that he still is capable of being great. Olga Kurylenko gives an okay performance. I read about other choices for her role and I feel like maybe one of those other actresses would have worked better, but she gets the job done.Overall, this is a film you should check out if you're a fan of sci-fi. It has lots of twists and turns and will keep you entertained for sure. It seems like it slipped under the radar a bit, which is a shame, but it's worth checking out.",Oblivion
217,azanti0029,Enjoyable despite some glaring plot holes.,6,12 April 2013,"This was a film I wanted to see on the biggest screen possible, short of the IMAX I opted for the Odeon Leceister Square, the film certainly benefited from being on the big screen. It's the future and man kind has been destroyed by an alien invasion, or so we're told. Th war is over and the humans won, but only at the result of turning the earth into a nuclear wasteland. The invaders, or scabs as they're called, survive in pockets and are still waging a guerrilla war of sorts on earth. In the sky above just in orbit is 'Tech' the control centre which is fuelling what remains of earths resources to the Saturn moon of Titan, this being where the remains of the human population has fled to. The remaining deployment on earth are protected by a fleet of drones, and the drones are maintained by Tech's and their support, who operate from up on high and perform drone repairs as and when needed. These 'efficent' teams are run by couples... one doing the flying/fixing (Tom Cruise) and the other hanging around in the control station / funky floating house - (Not Tom Cruise) but is everything as it seems and why does our hero keep having flashbacks to a former life that took place before he was born? This film looks great, and say what you like about Cruise, but I have always felt he can act and has great screen presence and charisma. The film looks fantastic. Large sweeping landscape of shots of the former United States laid waste into desert look so real and deserts littered with the hulks of ships and nuclear submarines with missile tubes opened are endearing images that will stay with me for some time to come. Where the film dips is when the plot gets going, about 20 minutes in I had a sense of what was coming and the twists as they were thrown at me were not a massive surprise. Morgan Freeman and the excellent Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are underused and barely have more than a few lines of dialogue each. They add weight, but their roles didn't really need to be filled out by stars when this is very much a Cruise vehicle.The ending of the film has been compared to Independence Day and I must confess it was the first thing I thought of when the film went in to its last few minutes. This didn't make it any less enjoyable and the film was a visual feast for the eyes and the acting decent enough all round but this is a story you wouldn't have a hard time poking a few holes in if you try and you wouldn't have to try very hard. Still, this director is making films that deserve to be seen on the big screen.",Oblivion
218,craig-hopton,Good but could have been better,7,3 August 2014,"This is definitely my type of movie - a slick, visually glorious SciFi with a nice SF plot twist thrown in.I really liked the portrayal of the abandoned Earth, the giant water- harvesting machines, and the futuristic space station outpost up in the clouds. The pairing of Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough as the space station's (and Earth's) sole guardians was spot on - you could believe they were attracted to each other but that they had such different personalities that tensions were bound to surface (as indeed they did).The early scenes on Earth in which Cruise outwits the Scavs, the supposed remnants of an alien army that humans had defeated, are excellent. As are some neat little Sci-Fi sequences such as that involving a suspended glass swimming pool in the space station.Unfortunately the movie doesn't maintain the high standard throughout. Inevitably other characters become involved as the plot develops, but somehow the characterisation isn't quite right. Morgan Freeman as the leader of the human resistance makes a dramatic entry when Cruise is captured, but is quickly sidelined into a bit part - an opportunity missed. And Olga Kurylenko is not well cast as the love interest. I didn't feel the chemistry between her and Cruise, which makes the his immediate attachment to her ahead of Riseborough seem a bit contrived.The ending is the worst part of all. A dénouement between human and alien forces beckons but is resolved very quickly by a terrible rip-off of Independence Day's ending - I'll say no more.So ultimately this was a little disappointing. But overall I did enjoy it, if only because slick SciFi movies always do it for me. Could and should have been better.",Oblivion
219,jaxbubba,A very average SCI Fi film,5,17 April 2013,"Even from the opening monologue of this film, you can tell that there is something just not quite right with the information that is being presented to the audience. The year is 2077. Fifty (50) years prior an alien invasion force known simply as ""The Scavengers"" or just plain ""Scavs"" destroyed the Earth's moon causing catastrophic global nature disasters (i.e. – earthquakes, tidal waves, tsunamis, etc.). Cities were toppled, worldwide panic and chaos followed, then the alien invasion commenced. In order to fight off the alien attackers, the world nuclear arsenal was dispatched. The War was won, but the planet was lost due to nuclear contamination leaving most of the planet uninhabitable. What was let of humanity was forced to leave the planet, and colonized on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is Tech 49, one of the last few humans stationed on the planet. He lives in a tower thousands of feet above the Earth where he and his communications officer and lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are part of an operation to extract the planet's remaining resources, especially water. Jack and Victoria maintain contact with civilization via a video link with their commander, Sally (Melissa Leo), and are due to join the rest of humanity on Titan in two weeks. Assisting Jack in his work are weaponized 'drones', airborne machines that scour the landscape to destroy the remaining alien resistance.Five years prior the government mandated mandatory memory wipes; however, Jack is suffering from recurring dreams and flashbacks of New York before the invasion and an unknown woman. This is quite peculiar given that New York was destroyed some fifty (50) years prior, and in the dreams Jack is an adult. Even more strange is this highly expansive and elaborate drone system that was erected to defend a devastated and abandoned planet. However, things really start to get interesting when 'the scavs' activate a homing beacon and a spaceship containing human bodies in stasis crash lands on the planet.I have nothing negative to say with regards to ""Oblivion"". The film was fine. However, is 'fine' what you are looking for when you are going to see a Sci Fi film??? I THINK NOT!!! There is nothing (forgive the pun) ""EARTH-SCATTERING"" about this film. The story is fine, the plot twist works, the acting and on screen chemistry are okay. But I did not leave this film thinking to myself, ""OMG, THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!"" It was more like ""Oh, okay, yeah that seems to explain everything."" I'm sure this weekend this film will do stellar business; however, I believe word-of-mouth will bring sharp declines in the following week's receipts. For those of you planning to see this film regardless of this review, do yourself a favor and see it during the Matinée Bargain showings. I would actually suggest waiting for its release to DVD or On DEMAND. Again, this is not a HORRENDOUS film; but it is a quite AVERAGE film.",Oblivion

This movie has little to offer unless you have never seen a movie before, or a video game. Most of the action was a video game which is fine if you're 12. I'm about 5 times that. The acting was stone face or ""awk"" surprised. In it's favor it wasn't 4 hours long. But is was over 2 hours long and that's about 110 minutes too long for this movie. The screenwriter obviously thought he had come up with some brilliant ideas. A mish mash of many others ideas is what we have. If you haven't figured out the entire plot in about 20 minutes... sorry you're a bit slow. ""Oblivion""... that's where this turkey should rest. I noted that in this country, it bombed.

222,JPfanatic93,I like the style but not the substance,5,23 September 2013,"Disappointing sci-fi actioner by Tron: Legacy director Joseph Kosinksi, yet another one of those flicks that seems to think that having Tom Cruise in every single scene makes for a good film in itself. This time Cruise plays a military veteran stationed at a small base up in the sky, from where he and his female co-worker (Andrea Riseborough) oversee and conduct repairs on a vast network of drones, which is used to safeguard giant machines scouring the planet of its last remaining natural resources. After all, we are talking about a post-apocalyptic Earth here, ravaged by war between humanity and some alien species, that witnessed most of the planet becoming uninhabitable to human life. Therefore, mankind left the planet and settled elsewhere, leaving Cruise and his drones as a sort of worldwide mop-up crew (think Wall-E). Or so Cruise thinks. His world is turned upside down soon enough when he encounters an underground force of human rebels who fight to preserve what's left of their planet under the command of Morgan Freeman (who unfortunately has much too small a role; he deserves better and so do we). The ugly truth is revealed when it turns out Cruise is the true alien evil and there's hundreds of duplicates of himself, an army of clones engineered by extraterrestrial intelligence to stripmine the planet while being unaware of the real facts, just hoping to soon complete their job and go home (think Moon). Of course the real bad guy – a giant super computer with its own nefarious agenda (think I, Robot) – won't allow Cruise to switch sides so easily and thus a rather boring fight ensues between the rebels and the drones. Despite the sometimes intriguing premise of the main character finding out his whole life is a lie so he needs to reinvent himself, existential questions about the nature of the self are briskly ignored in favour of monotonous action scenes involving guns, bikes and funky aircraft, all of them seemingly designed by the Apple Corporation, considering the film's over-reliance on slick, white, minimalistic looking technology. After a while, shots of Cruise flying around in his little helicopter get exceedingly tedious. At least the spectacular Iceland vistas do not, nor do the grand sights of famous (digital) architecture left to rot in desolate landscapes. And it is gratifying to see Hollywood jumping on the 'creepy drone technology' bandwagon so quickly (though it will probably brand the movie as 'soooo 2013' in years to come). But despite a few points in Oblivion's favour, it can't be helped this film is simply dull and derivative.",Oblivion
223,tinovalkki,beautiful and surprising,8,4 July 2013,"Oblivion is one of those movies that it is not good idea to read anything about the movie before entering movie theatre. It is enough to know that it tells a story after alien invasion , world has destroyed and Tom Cruise is in it. Movie starts nice smoothly and builds it's story slowly with nice mystery. Tom Cruise seems to fit his role as a last man after apocalyptic post mortem nuclear war which has almost destoyed the whole world. He makes his role with main requirement way, but somehow that is not enough. And Andrea Risenborough as a winy Victoria won't help the acting at all. Even Morgan Freeman won't help the story as it shoud be. Even that the roling won't convince enough Obilvion is so beautiful to watch. And somehow the story surprises you at the end. Visuality of this movie is the best you get of it and helps to rise the movie easilly above the average scifi flick. This is one of those movies that you have to watch it in movie theatre.

224,adrongardner,Cliché Fantastic,7,25 April 2013,"Like James Cameron may have said about Avatar, Oblivion is every single sic-fi movie you've already seen and it's pretty good - in fact much better than the Smurfy farce Avatar ended up being. There's plenty of Kosinki's TRON Legacy in here. Count in Matrix, the Death Star from Star Wars, HAL from 2001 and the robots from The Black Hole. Basically anything you can think of. But I still somehow liked the heck out of this movie. I don't even like Tom Cruise and I liked the heck out of this movie. It's so genuinely nerdy, it's genuine. Those Drones are actually the star of the show I think. The sound design for their menacing R2D2 speech is pretty scary stuff.I don't know what to tell you about Oblivion other than I saw it twice and I may see it again.

228,julian-mumford,A solid start to the summer blockbuster season,8,13 April 2013,"In 2077 Jack Harper (Cruise) is a drone repair man on what is left of Earth. He lives in a house suspended in the clouds with his female mission controller, their every need catered for as they enjoy 'another day in paradise', making an effective team under the control of TET head office.The moon remains shattered in the night sky following a World War to rescue the planet from an alien invasion sixty years before. A war that was won but necessitated all remaining humans to leave for Titan's moon to start a new life. The power for the moon is provided by colossal machines pulling resource from the sea, protected by drones against 'Scav's', which is where Jack comes in. The drones are wonderful characters, like ""Pixar's"" EVE but with a very bad attitude, great sound effects and guns, lots of guns.Jack and Victoria's (Riseborough) life is pretty good. Their apartment in the sky is every Apple fanboy's wet dream and with the added benefit of naked night-time dips in their suspended pool, the daily grind is easily forgotten about.Jack however, has occasional flashbacks, remembering a woman he knew at the Empire state building, only snatches but nonetheless disturbing as both Victoria and himself had voluntary mind wipe to enable optimum mission effectiveness. The team and especially Jack's sorties to the surface are monitored minute by minute by 'Sally' (Leo), rather oddly with a strong southern drawl, back at TET.Forays to the surface are usually uneventful, Jack repairs drones, gets them back online, fights off occasional 'Scav' incursions, stays away from the radiation zone and looks forward to his next night-time swim. Most of the audience would think, this is not so bad, sign me up.However, Jack has doubts and finding the occasional discarded book, he starts to think, feel and yearn for a simpler life, perhaps more than is best for him. This gets noticed but not by who you would expect.The story, like a hyperactive magpie borrows and steals from many more famous Sc-Fi films to pull together a more thoughtful film than you might have been expecting. There is very effective action but the movie is not about blowing stuff up or killing hordes of aliens, there is intelligence here and for once, it is mostly in the script.Cruise sells this better than anyone one around, increasingly a divisive figure due to his personal life, he arguably remains our only remaining true old fashioned film mega-star. He acts well here and holds the film together, with excellent support from Riseborough as his mission buddy. The film is yet another example of the point we have now reached, where state of the art effects allow the world the characters live in to be displayed seamlessly, yet with no obvious effects at all.Visually and sonically, the film is outstanding. Director of 'Tron Legacy' Joseph Kosinski and his team, no stranger to green screens, have been so effective that it appears that they just shot the film as live action by just filming what was there. This no doubt contradicts the months of effects work of various kinds, to put such a film on the screen, truly impressive and ground breaking in it's own way.The film also allows Cruise to indulge his passion for riding, motorbikes, abseiling and flying cool pretend spaceships, all whilst wearing flash shades. It would not have taken long for him to to sign on the dotted line. Cruise also gets to team up with Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurlylenko in roles that would be a spoiler alerts. Despite Kurlynko's obvious appeal, Freeman's voice is as usual the main attraction here.Flaws, occasionally the film is heavy on American iconography and the link to Baseball and American football can seem rather indulgent in today's world movie market. The story is not always easy to follow but some thought afterwards, should most plot pieces together in the right order.The film is free of any notable graphic violence and despite some tasteful nudity and one very well deserved profanity, free of anything else that would annoy a family audience. A treat in modern blockbuster movies.Summary Considerably more intelligent than most Sci-Fi blockbusters, light on action but portraying a created but wholly believable world, beautifully realised.An enjoyable Sci-Fi thriller, at times derivative but in an age when everything has been done, this still manages to find a new angle and makes a solid start to the summer blockbuster season.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Oblivion
229,The_Dead_See,"An entertaining and thought-provoking sci-fi drama, mis-marketed as an action movie.",7,6 September 2013,"I truly enjoyed Oblivion. It's one of those increasingly rare sci-fi movies that takes the more courageous visual route of being ""clean and polished"" instead of the boring trend of gritty, blue-filtered futurescapes. It's post apocalyptic but it's gorgeous, the downed landmarks of the western world look like tourist attractions in the morning sunlight, the technologies and habitats look sparkling and well maintained. It's a very bright and airy movie visually and the cinematography is stunning throughout.It's not only courageous in it's visual style either. The story is balls to the wall sci-fi, unhampered by human antagonists. We're talking alien minds, memory wipes, laser guns and combat drones. I won't go so far as to call the story original - in fact it seems quite derivative of several popular sci-fi films. There are shades of The Matrix Revolutions, Moon, Total Recall, The Island, Logans Run and others. But instead of throwing these homages together into a mashup that just makes you want to watch the original films instead, it blends them seamlessly and emerges as a solid and entertaining movie in its own right.It's not perfect though. I have three gripes with it. First and foremost is that it was horribly mismarketed as a sci-fi actioner and it isn't. There are a couple of decent (but not outstanding) action set pieces but the majority of Oblivion is a moment-of-awakening drama and a love story, with thematic elements of what it means to be mortal and to die well running through it. Its going to disappoint the hell out of kids who go in looking for big bangs. This is much closer to 'Moon' in pace than something like 'Star Trek Into Darkness'.My second gripe is that, as thought-provoking as it was, I can't help but think there are some hefty plot holes in there. I would have to watch it a few times over to pull them out clearly but my gut instinct tells me they are there. Most of them are explicable if you extrapolate far enough with your own imagination, but it would have been a stronger film if the concepts, plot elements and character motivations were more watertight.Third gripe is a minor one, but significant enough for me - Morgan Freeman was massively underused. His character is a cardboard cutout cliché of a rebel leader and could have been so much more interesting and complex.The gripes aren't enough to bring a good movie down though, and Oblivion is a really good movie.

What is so bad is 1: You can spot so many films that it is trying to steal from (""Total Recall"" being the most obvious, but ""Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes"" (the humans living underground, nuclear warhead and Morgan Freeman's glasses), ""Buck Rodgers"" (the suspended animation), ""Independence Day (the way they delivered the nuke),""Top Gun"" and even ""Knight And Day"" (Cruise on the motorcycle)). 2: It is so predictable, that (spoiler alert) when 'Jack 49' does not kill 'Jack 52', you knew 'Jack 52', would end up with 'Julia' in the end. 3: There is no real evil villain. ex: Is 'Sally' (Melissa Leo) real, a clone, a human, an alien, a computer program, a leader, or what? 4: Too many plot holes. ex: 'Julia' smiled when she saw the Yankee Cap, and yes, Tom Cruise is a big Yankee fan, but why would 'Jack' (Cruise) wear it.? He did not know it was something special to him? They also never explained why they used him as a clone and what happened to the Original 'Jack' and his partner 'Victoria'? 5: Not enough action. The only reasons to watch is the playing of Led Zeppelin, and Olga Kurylenko ('Julia') who is hot to say the least. Basically an epic fail. 2 Stars.",Oblivion

Then, around hour thirteen, the movie takes a new turn and a totally different plot is introduced, even less interesting than the previous five.

This one has just that...and Tom Cruise. He is superior in an action film. Not only can the guy act, but he really gets into the action part of it with a vengeance. Not all that many movie actors are so believable and enjoyable to watch as Cruise. And he does shine in this one. Morgan Freeman's always wonderful. His part wasn't all that long in this one, but what there was could only be termed choice. I wouldn't miss a Morgan Freeman film any more than I would a Tom Cruise movie. Together they're terrific. Throw in a few nice twists and it all adds up to a picture well worth spending money to see.",Oblivion
233,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: Earth decimated,7,20 April 2013,"Oblivion is the kind of film that once you see the trailer you have high expectations for what it will deliver. It did deliver on some spectacular images from high atop the world in Jack Harper's (Tom Cruise) sky living quarters, where he and Vicka (Andrea Riseborough) are an effective team. Visually, the look of this film was quite imaginative. This was Mr. Cruise's turn at being the 'one', that individual who is the savior of humanity. There were too many scenes that reminded me of The Matrix for me to give this film high marks in the creativity column, I seriously expected that at some point Jack would hold out his hand and fry the drones that were in pursuit. This is another film that gets segmented, but in this case it is a matter of before Julia (Olga Kurylenko) and after Julia. Before, Julia the mood of the story was a ride along with Jack as he performed his duty of drone repairs and it would be putting it mildly to say that it seemed to drone on and one, pun intended. Then after Julia the pace picks up as did my interest in what was taking place and where the plot was leading me. When Jack meets Beech (Morgan Freeman) a Morpheus-like character, again it was just so Matrix-esque he is given instruction as to how he should learn the truth about what was happening, since simply telling him would not could not possibly be accepted or comprehended. The special effects in Oblivion were more the marvel of this film than the story, which was a blending of other films of this genre that had come before it. To be able to convincingly depict a thriving metropolis as a wasteland buried under a desert was amazing, but the real star of the film was the chopper with the on board bike accessory. The maneuverability, compactness and styling of that transport is the kind of concept technology that I would love to see realized by some science geek who would. In a side note, now I understand why there was so little of Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones season two, he was off playing Sykes (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Had the before Julia storyline been as engaging as the after Julia story I would have been more inclined to go green, but alas I have to give it an amber light",Oblivion
234,basilisksamuk,Film noir as science fiction,8,14 April 2013,"This film seems to be attracting a lot of criticism on the basis of similarities to other science fiction films. The references (and sometimes they are clearly deliberate) did not particularly concern me. I might have felt differently if it had been done badly but for the most part it was done well. Why should it matter? After all you don't hear many criticisms of other genres along these lines. A film wouldn't be much of a film noir if it didn't have a doomed protagonist, plot twists, cops, private eyes etc. In fact Oblivion strikes me as a good candidate for sharing the DNA of film noir and as being as good a mystery as it is a reworking of some well-known science fiction tropes.This isn't a ground breaking film and it probably won't make anyone's top ten SF films but it is certainly above average and well worth a visit to the cinema to see on a big screen. Visually it is very striking and quite beautiful to watch. The only visual aspect that disappointed me was the obvious CGI in the shots of the bike being driven over vast tracks of land or ruins (I rewatched Dark Knight Rises the other night and you can see the same problem with Catwoman driving Batman's fat-tyred bike). The CGI is otherwise as good as you will see anywhere and doesn't rely on gimmicks like 3D.The tone of this film reminds me of Solaris - Tarkovskiy's version not the snoozefest that Soderbergh directed. Tom Cruise, and we as the audience, are being invited to grapple with some interesting philosophical questions here. We can ignore them and just take this as a fun film if we like but this film encouraged me to consider some quite deep questions of identity. I've seen commentary that Oblivion is too smart for some moviegoers and too dumb for others. For me the balance between a good-looking, exciting film and something with interesting questions to ask was just right.",Oblivion

Oblivion's story, pretty much, came down to being nothing more than poorly recycled nonsense that's been ripped off from just about every other Sci-Fi/Action film from the last 30 years, or so.And speaking about the likes of Tom Cruise - I think it's about time for this talentless, little pretty-boy to retire from show biz and go join all of his self-righteous brethren in Scientology heaven.",Oblivion
236,Vincent_B,Predictable Average Sci-Fi Flick,5,2 January 2015,"This movie was a little too easy to figure out and has issues with character motivation. Too many clues are given to the plot in the first few minutes to think otherwise.Lots of visual ""eye candy"" make up this film. But I am not entertained by a two hour fireworks display either. Over all this could have been told in an hour on TV such as the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone.A few scenes in the movie seemed like forced acting. For example; A lot of Vics scenes lacked motivation. Jack's deception at the end seemed rather lame. No Oscar performances here.It is worth a look, if you have nothing else to do. It is better than just sitting around picking your nose. Here are some of the movies ""flaws"" if you want to call it that.DEAD GIVE AWAYS: I am immediately made suspicious of any ""superiors"" who demand a mind wipe for being the janitor and repair man. Jack and Vic never seem to question the Tech 49 and Tower 49 naming convention for the only 2 people remaining on a dying world.

237,charles000,Surprisingly well done,9,24 September 2017,"Surprisingly well done. Not an entirely original concept, but the story had enough unique features to still make it compelling and interesting.I freely admit to being a bit skeptical going in with Tom Cruise as the lead role, but that was tempered by knowing that Olga Kurylenko would be there. OK, I could watch her in just about anything (and have seen almost every film she's ever been in), and was not disappointed. This is a film where you will want to pay attention to details. Understanding who (and what) Tom Cruise's character is will become apparent as the film progresses, so am not going to recite the details of that plot thread here, but it does require a willingness to follow those details as they emerge. As for Olga, this may be her best performance yet. She has progressed remarkably since her early days in films like ""the Assassin Next Door"".That's not to take anything away from Andrea Riseborough, who played the complex role of a highly intelligent woman, but one who is conflicted and confined by specific belief boundaries that had been programmed into her. Morgan Freeman, of course, fits his part exactly, as will become apparent later in the film.No spoilers here, but I might offer that in the genre' of post apocalyptic, earth is in dire peril and who we are destined to be as a type of species plot formats, this one is a bit different. There is considerably more to this production than just eye candy, though the CGI is quite well done. Unlike some films of a quasi similar genre', the CGI is beautifully done where relevant, but does not overpower the details of the plot threads as they emerge. This is one of those rare examples where the balance between technically stunning visual content and pace of story actually fit remarkably well together. Kudos to Joseph Kosinski for maintaining that balance in this well crafted production.A very solid 9 stars for this one.",Oblivion
238,themissingpatient,Worthy of a Sigh,3,27 July 2013,"Jack, Tom Cruise, is a survivor of some future war which left earth mostly uninhabitable, due to radiation, leaving what was left of the human race to go live on one of Saturn's moon's. He and his partner are an efficient team chosen to stay back on earth for special duties such as drone maintenance. As Jack's retirement approaches, where he will be relieved of his duties and get to join the rest of humanity on Titan, he can't help but begin to question his dreams.From there on, Oblivion tries to pull of a series of twists, none of which we haven't seen before. Instead of being the original, new sci-fi epic Oblivion promises to be, it just steals ideas from Total Recall, Moon and The Matrix without being anywhere close to as good as those films were.Oblivion starts off with promise in the pacing and visuals but when Morgan Freeman shows up as a Morpheus character, it just goes from one clique to the next with a finale worthy of a sigh.",Oblivion
239,fraser-simons,A fun cyberpunk romp,7,4 January 2017,"I thought it was fun and interesting. It could have explored some themes a lot better but I suspect there's more depth there than people first thought. It seems like Tom Cruise is pretty into cyberpunk. Vanilla Sky, Oblivion, Minority Report. Feels like buddy likes it. And so do I. This movie deserves a 7, I think. It was enjoyable, if a bit transparent but acting was good, production values were great, some great shots, and as I said, deeper than some might have thought initially. So I debated as to if this is cyberpunk or not and in the end I think it is. With all these movies when I give my thoughts here there will be spoilers I'm sure.There's a stark contrast of colours in use: Tech is always white from the guns to his ship. It's always in stark contrast to organic substance. He begins with always seeking out a more organic life as the system can't fulfill what he's looking for. Including changing into other clothes and having an existence entirely separate from his purpose and the system in place. His very nature is what ultimately sets him free, a very cyberpunk theme and while he's searching for this elusive thing, the music is almost always very cyberpunk and it changes to something else when he's on task for the system.When he does finally deviate from exactly what he's supposed to do in a way that is essentially a form of desertion he's told this: ""... I can't protect you""Also it's telling that the ""scad"" are not portrayed as human until the protagonist goes against the system and is forced to learn the truth, all the while within he's bathed in a spotlight no less. But is being held in a dirty, grungy place. Which his uniform now is, for the entire rest of the movie. ""You're not who you think you are"" A prevailing theme in it is nature vs technology, it is constantly rebelling against tech. For instance the system can't track him when he's literally inside of it, multiple lightning strikes disable tech during the course of the movie, and he continues to remember things despite whatever tech was used for him to be reprogrammed. As in most cyberpunk, the punishment is death for not being apart of the system, often the death of others close to the protagonist. Often this comes with an unwelcome truth, as it did here as well.Technology is neutral within the setting, with both sides using it as they see fit. While not typical of cyberpunk, it isn't straying from it either as the protagonist could be viewed as technology themselves. With nature vs tech vying over him constantly throughout the film with his memories vs programming. When they're running away in their hideout as they're being attacked, there is flickering lights in their sanctuary meaning that the system is there and things are in contention. This seems to happen in pretty much allllll western cyberpunk films. Probably from noir?",Oblivion
240,Lomedin,The anti-Nero,6,16 September 2013,"Tom Cruise continues to act in sci-fi movies, perhaps something to do with the scientology, since his creator was a sci-fi writer. He delivers the same solid acting as he always does, playing the cool guy with no problems (he could be the same character in all his roles, it'd not make a difference). It bothers me a bit that his girls are 30 years younger than him. I'd like to see him being the husband of an older woman for once. Hm, I guess that would make the partner 90 though.This is an entertaining movie, with flawless special effects. It's full of plot holes the size of Tet, a good few predictable occurrences and it seems to take some ideas from other movies/books like 2001, Moon, Independence Day or Terminator. The first half of the movie interested me more. After that things get a bit too Hollywood and we start seeing a little cliché here and there.Alas, it's an enjoyable film if you don't take it too serious and try to leave your mind blank to avoid seeing all the errors this movie makes. With that in mind, it's re-watchable, since its pace makes it a fun flick and the excellent fxs make it eye-candy.And, well, I saw that there were 666 review written before I started to write this, thus the review title, if anybody is interested and gets the idea. Sorry, temptation was too much!",Oblivion
241,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,5,12 April 2013,"If you've seen Oblivion's trailer, you know what to expect, since much of the story is spoiled in it. But the saddest part is, the movie is very predictable even if you haven't seen the trailer - just another Hollywood money-making sci-fi/action product. Except, Oblivion is based on a comic book. At least that's what they want you to believe - the comic book was never published, the director Joseph Kosinski started an illustrated novel and then abandoned the project to work on the movie. He said it was not intended for distribution, only for legal purposes, and Tom Cruise found it interesting.In the year 2077 Earth is uninhabitable, after the nuclear war between humans and aliens known as ""Scavs"". They had destroyed the Moon, which caused natural disasters, and started invading Earth; humans eventually won the war but lost the planet. Some of those who survived are now living in the Tet, a large spaceship orbiting Earth, waiting to go to Titan, Saturn's moon where the rest of humanity is waiting. Jack (Tom Cruise) lives with Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) in a house above the clouds and spends his day repairing drones - Scav killing machines - while she oversees him and communicates with the main commander on Tet. One day, Jack finds Julia (Olga Kurylenko) in a crashed spacecraft, who will make him question everything he thought he knew about himself and the war.If a movie is in the ""science-fiction"" genre, I expect it to be at least somewhat accurate about the ""scientific"" facts it presents. In Oblivion, Jack and Victoria live in a house above the clouds, and can normally walk around it and even swim in a pool in front of the entrance. They don't seem to mind that they are located in the stratosphere where the air is one thousand times thinner than on Earth and where it's pretty cold. I guess I should forgive the scriptwriter's mistake of considering the Moon's destruction responsible for earthquakes, but it still bothers me. And how can Jack and Victoria believe that, even after Earth was destroyed, humans managed to build their house, the Tet, those giant water-sucking machines and the drones? How could people possibly live on one of Saturn's moons if they had not made it habitable before? And they had only 60 years to do so. I suppose I'm nitpicking, but all these inconsistencies ruined the movie for me.Also, the movie is way too long. Not much happens in the first half an hour, it is basically just made of shots of the destroyed Earth and remains of the American civilization (because nobody else matters in Hollywood). Although, I must admit, the cinematography in this part is good. Unfortunately, it doesn't make Oblivion any less boring. Furthermore, the special effects are also good - but with a $120 million budget and being a Sci-Fi movie, they can't be bad. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is bad. The scene when Jack and Victoria swim in the pool at night is romantic and sexy, but the music doesn't fit that mood at all. And then there's Ramble On by Led Zeppelin, probably put in the movie to show us that Jack/Tom Cruise is one cool guy. I should also mention Morgan Freeman, the exposition man, who was probably cast just because he has a nice voice and was supposed to explain the story. The other actors did a good job as well, I suppose, but their performances won't be particularly remembered: Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko does an unimpressive job, Andrea Riseborough is the best of the three. Interestignly, Kosinski only directed another movie - TRON: Legacy - which reminds of Oblivion: great visual effects but poor storytelling. I surely hope he won't continue making this kind of movies, since he seems to be on bad terms with science fiction.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Oblivion

243,rebecca-ry,Any Film + Tom Cruise = Top of the box office,6,23 April 2013,"'Oblivion' is the latest Tom Cruise movie that is currently doing extremely well in both the US and UK box offices. Tom Cruise is – for some reason – one of those actors who will attract the masses to a film no one would otherwise care about.This film however is a film people will genuinely be interested in seeing regardless of Tom Cruise. Joseph Kosinski has written a fairly solid story here; it has been a while since there has been a decent sci- fi film out that hasn't been linked to a film or book series. However, the film does seem like Moon, Total Recall, The Matrix and 2001: A Space Odyssey rolled into one. There are points in the film where nothing really happens, this does not mean they should have replaced them with action sequences, because there were a decent amount of them and they were very well done. There were way too many flashback scenes that were very boring, they showed the same flashback almost a dozen times but with no extended parts that taught us anything, it was literally the same scenes over and over again. There were a lot of instances where I was bored but it was not all the fault of the writer.Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko are the blandest pair of actors ever it would seem. Andrea Riseborough's performance is fine; her character was supposed to be quite cold and tries her best here. Cruise and Kurylenko have no chemistry whatsoever and you simply do not care what happened to them. This is where the major flaw of 'Oblivion' was noticed; the story was pretty good, the effects and props were amazing – though it would seem aliens have discovered Apple – and the sets were just fantastic and really interesting to look at but the actors were just too dull! Morgan Freeman gave the best performance, his most interesting one in a while, but unfortunately had next to no screen time.Overall, 'Oblivion' is not a bad film. It was clearly made by someone who has a love and respect for sci-fi but it could have been so much better had two other actors been given the lead roles.",Oblivion

246,mitchell5954,My Favorite Tom Cruise Film In Years,8,28 June 2019,"Oblivion is an interesting and refreshing entry in the Sci-Fi genre. Lately the Sci-Fi films that have come out are mainly style over substance. The Transformers films are ones that quickly come to mind. I am a big fan of science fiction! Oblivion and the new Star Trek movie are the two movies that I wanted to see most this summer. I was not disappointed with this film! Oblivion is a film that makes you think. When I watched this film in the theater I did not fully understand what was going on. When I thought about it more on the way home I began to piece everything together. I like science fiction films that can do that. This kinda film reminded me of films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of the atmosphere and tone. It also reminded me of films like Wall-e and I Am Legend.The special effects of this movie are fantastic. This film is able to create a beautiful looking world, and immersing the audience in it. The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about. Morgan Freeman's character is also likable. The other characters though are pretty bland.Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning. There is not much action in this movie either. The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it. The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is. However, I find Oblivion a very refreshing and enjoyable Sci-Fi film.",Oblivion

Some people here are calling it predictable and obvious, but I, maybe to my detriment, still had no idea where the plot was going until the end. Is it derivative of other science fiction movies? Maybe, but at least it's daring enough to be an original story instead of a remake or wanna-be franchise starter.Joseph Kosinski is a highly underrated director of science fiction and I hope he continues in this genre. After my ultimate guilty pleasure (TRON Legacy) he directed this gem about Tom Cruise's isolated life on a wreaked Earth. The photography and imagery is completely stunning, more so than many other 'acclaimed' science fiction and independent films, and it is filled with creative and unique designs that you just don't really see in a one-off movie like this. (Bubble-ship, the drones, his air-house, etc). The pacing is a little slow but that's because they need to show off all these designs and scenery that are basically pieces of art, and I wouldn't care if they took hours doing it. The color palette is fantastic. I found more positive aspects in it than in other modern sci fi films such as the okay Arrival. Maybe Tom Cruise just turns too many people off. Too bad for them.",Oblivion

Here are a couple of reasons why I was so bored : 1) In the first part of the movie, there were only 2 / 3 characters. And we didn't see any other human beings, not even in the background. I think there's a reason why a lot of movies don't do this.. because it doesn't work. 2) I felt that the movie was obviously trying to build some suspense. But I was just waiting for the point to happen, when the suspense was broken. And it finally happened, but it was roughly 1.5 hours into the movie. Also, it was not that dramatic... and certainly not worth the wait. All in all, it was so disappointing.",Oblivion

If you take elements of I, Robot, The Matrix, Independence Day, Total Recall and of course Top Gun and put them all in a bowl and mixed them up, you would come up with Oblivion. This film was totally crazy and literally out of this world. And to top it all off, with all the previews and the length of this film be prepared to get butt blisters for two and a half hours. I do have to say that I thought the special effects were brilliantly done, especially with the ship that Jack is flying. I also liked the fact that explanations of what was going on were trickled in throughout the film, right up to the very end. Basically the film centered on a band of rebels that are left on earth after a planetary war who are fighting against the establishment. Jack (Tom Cruise) is a drone repairman with less than two weeks to go on his so called tour of duty. Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) is his eyes in the sky and takes direction from the control center that is wedged in space. As depicted in the trailer, Jack is captured by the rebel tribe and this is where the journey of discovery begins. Beech (Morgan Freeman) is the rebel leader and is determined to get Jack to see the truth. This is also the point in the film where there starts to be a lot of twists and turns. I did hear myself saying (a couple of times), ""what the heck is going on here"". This is when the fun started for me, because I started thinking about all the other films that this one stole from. I think that director Joseph Kosinski did a pretty good job considering the only other film that he has produced was Tron: Legacy. He is definitely headed in the right direction if this is the genre that he wants to stick with. Although the film was a little long for my taste, it was definitely not boring. The film moved at a steady pace and the little enlightenments along the way kept my interest. I think that this film does merit the price of a ticket for the CGI and cinematography alone. Oblivion did not leave me oblivious so I am going to go ahead and give this film a green light.",Oblivion

Quickly - you can anticipate the conclusion - which does not make the movie worse much .. but of course it does take away fromt he surprise. (especially when you consider the movie Moon, not so long before Oblivion - well, not so long being 3 or 4 years i think) There are flaws in the story of course - flaws that are obvious when you think about it - but not so relevant when you just enjoy watching it - mostly due to the movies pace.Worth watching ... but it has little to no re-watch quality.",Oblivion

257,AbhiMathews,A True Sci-Fi Film,5,21 July 2013,"Science fiction films are often under-appreciated because viewers often forget to watch the movies with an open mind. ""Oblivion"" is a story with contemporary resonance as the themes of artificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life are prominent within society today. As these are two highly speculated areas in the world, it is easy for viewers to visualize and relate to the transformation the Earth has undergone in ""Oblivion"". This movie is filled with action in a devastated Earth that is now inhabitable. It is with this simple premise that the writers of ""Oblivion"" create a captivating story of a man on a mission to seek answers. Although ""Oblivion"" has an amazing plot, there are clear reasons why this movie has received low scores from critics. Firstly, most of the cast were not suitable playing their parts. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are great in their respective roles, but with the exception of a few minor people, the actors and actresses don't appear to be fit for their characters. Also, the movie had a great background story but the writers did not fully capitalize in delivering the story since it was troublesome to follow at times, and there was more that could have been done with the script. And at 124 minutes long, this movie could have deleted unnecessary scenes which could have focused on the main message. Without providing too much information, there were scenes of pure boredom that could have been altered in such a way to further explain the events of the war and the characters' stories to help the audience better understand the events occurring.With a lot of untapped potential and poor acting, the movie does deserve the mediocre rating critics have given it. Nonetheless, with the superb story and adventurous journey filmed, I would highly recommend ""Oblivion"" to any person with an open mind. This movie will provoke you to think and question the world around us, and that is why it deserves an 8 out of 10 despite its flaws.",Oblivion

Parts of the plot are shamefully ripped off.The storyline is entirely predictable. We've seen it a thousand times by now. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's also quite confusing.The lead actress is somewhat creepy. Tom Cruise does a nominal job in the lead role. The visual design is quite good, as is typical for this kind of movie. It's a shame that story writing isn't as straightforward as designing the afterburner of a space ship.The biggest problem with Oblivion is the predictable story, and especially the ending.

259,tecnogaming,This is what sci-fi should be all about!!,9,24 July 2013,"OK, THIS is what sci-fi is, not The Colony or 2012.In Oblivion everything is not what it seems to be and the movie starts with a beautiful concept that it is able to get it through and through.From the very start you know something is off in the task Jack is assigned to do but I will not tell any spoilers since, knowing them will ruin the majority of the good script and incredible solid experience.The acting is top notch, the sound is by far one of the best i've seen this year, music is incredible inspired and directing is, well, how to put it, one of the best i've seen this year.I was almost beginning to lost all hope on the sci-fi front for a good movie when Oblivion makes its appearance now we have a major contender for the movie of the year alone with Elysium.This is what sci-fi SHOULD be all about, not about special effects (although there are and they are top notch) but characters we care about, a script that is solid, lines well said, moments that have meaning and are not clichéd and above all, a plot well developed. Oblivion will not try to impress you with action sequences, effects are natural, incredible well crafted and more importantly, they are there for the purpose of telling the story, not to show off, also, the movie's action parts are there too, for the plot, they don't feel to be put to give you a wow moment, but to put you into the character's shoes, the world of Oblivion is incredible alive!Oblivion will bore the easy movie goer that wants action but will turn upside down the sci-fi lover, this movie has it all, it is slow at the beginning but not because it's boring, it's because it takes it's characters very seriously, the plot is extremely interesting and full of enigmas, rises a lot of questions and opens up the can or worms to a lot of interesting ideas with the plot after the movie ends, Oblivion takes advantage of it's actors, have deep atmosphere that will expand in your mind after you watched it, and above all, it is inspired.Oblivion does not think it's viewers are dumb, it does not need to explain everything and so, does not need to deliver stupid obvious lines through it's actors, you have to figure things out for yourself and this is a wonderful comeback for the genre.The ending is actually so good, without giving you all the answers but actually creating new ones that feels like sci-fi can be a respected genre once again.Oblivion is miles ahead of any other movie of this genre from this year, you MUST go see it you will not regret it, and don't let anyone spoil the movie for you, make your own conclusions and enjoy it.It's the first movie I truly enjoyed this year and deserves a solid 8 out of 10.",Oblivion
260,blurnieghey,"Great Visuals, Weak Story",6,7 February 2021,"I originally saw this in the theaters and for some reason I thought about it the other day, only to find it in a thrift store for $2 a couple hours later. What are the odds of that? I rarely watch newer movies but I was encouraged to check it out at the time and I thought it was decent, but nothing epic. The second time around I was a lot more critical, however.First off, the good. The film kicks ass visually. I love post-nuke films and the fight scenes flying through the ruins, while derivative of Star Wars, are great and all the sets and special effects are simply top notch--there's no two ways about it and maybe that's why I didn't pick up on how illogical this film is the first time I saw it. For one thing, why did the invaders or ""bad guys"" or whatever need to go through the rigmarole of having ""Jacks"" and ""Victorias"" in the first place? Wouldn't it have been more efficient to have some sort of androids doing that work? Clearly the drones were effective and they obviously had the AI technology. This alone shoots a big hole in the premise of the whole movie. And why did they make the events leading up to the ""present"" start going down in 2017, immediately making the story implausible, as we didn't have anything close to that sort of spacecraft technology in 2013? And why would the flight recorder retrieved from the detached module containing Julia have data from the cockpit when the two sections detached before the ""bad guy"" reveal takes place, never mind that the camera angles from a stationary camera would not look like what we see in the film? Why do the drones have a soft spot in the back where you can just rip out the power supply or plow a bullet to disable it? They couldn't locate that part in some other section of the device's interior? There is other nit-picky stuff, but those four flaws kind of render this otherwise decent film kind of silly to me. Not a bad film at all, otherwise, and worth a look to be sure. If memory serves, it didn't fair to well at the box office, a fate it didn't deserve, but it has too much wrong with the story to make it excellent.",Oblivion
261,Pingo-2,Directed by Captain Obvious for kids.,5,30 July 2013,"First - OBLIVION has a great cast and looks wonderful! The post-apocalyptic setting is one of the best I've ever seen, it's beautiful and cool, tough and a bit epic.Sounds - especially the sound effects of the drones - are equally great. Maybe the sounds of the drones are actually the best thing of the whole film! Yes - they are.However, that's it. The story is messy with tons of irregularities. It doesn't stick to it's own logic/realism and is very obvious. You will know what's going to happen next - you can even tell what LINES they're going to say! It's that obvious.This makes it a bit boring at places. Especially the whole dream-sequence (which the film-makers for some reason seem forced to show you ten times) is a tired shot that doesn't add anything to the film at all. Yes - we understood the concept in the first frame - now get on with it! Yes, it's a summer-blockbuster-movie, but it's so dumbed down that it feels like the title should be OBVIOUS FOR DUMMIES instead.It's based on a graphic novel (which I haven't read), but the film uses re-hashes from IMMORTAL (also graphic novels from the 80's + a 2004-feature film), the FALLOUT games and a bit of MATRIX thrown in for the ""mystery"" + MOON of course.It's a pretty stupid film though, even though it's entertaining at parts. If it was a low-budget feature with no known names I wouldn't complain. But this is a major sci-fi with a $120M budget! Question is: why didn't they spend at least a few hundred bucks on a script that was air-tight? Watch this with your brain turned off.",Oblivion
262,MovieGuyFunTime,Great on So Many Levels Yet Still Missing Something,8,9 July 2021,"Acting- Great.World Building- Great.Special Effects/CGI- Great.Cinematography- Great.So what's missing? I never really connected with the story or the characters. I suppose, with many films like Oblivion that are taken from a graphic novel, one really should be familiar with the novel to really be able to appreciate the film.I kept feeling like things were going to start making sense at any time but they never really did... Not even at the end when it became 'somewhat' clear what the real situation was. I felt like it lacked connection and investment with the viewer. Oblivion is a beautiful film and technologically very impressive but pretty wrapping paper does not a fine gift make. Still, I think it needs a second viewing and some more in-depth knowledge of the source material. But that is on me and it doesn't make the film weaker per se, it only means it is THAT type of film... it depends a little more on outside info to really connect with the viewer.It also, at times feels more like a video game than a movie AND there are some pretty preposterous logic flaws (like the inability for command control to force a return of a scout ship via autopilot that has been taken for unauthorized explorations... and a relatively simple means to defeat scout drones by popping open an access cover and stealing their energy source a la the Lost in Space Robot's power pack... I mean, seems like these issues should not have passed initial quality/security audits).Anyway, the premise is interesting and intriguing IF it takes until the very end to discover what it is. The fight scenes are fine but nothing we really haven't seen before.. a bit cliched for the most part.Oblivion is slick and impressive in a lot of ways but it demands more from the audience than it actually provides them to make a strong connection work. I had a 'what did I just watch' feeling immediately after viewing. But I also found myself thinking about it a great deal afterwards as well... so there's maybe more to the film than I'm giving credit.",Oblivion

264,JRmf,Stunning CGI but a confused story,6,17 August 2013,"While the CGI and sheer spectacle in Oblivion made it a must-see for me as a SF fan, I found the plot quite confusing, even after having seen the movie in the theater and at home, and having read the Wikipedia plot writeup carefully at least twice. The ""memory wipe"" doesn't make a lot of sense, and the use of clones in the movie adds to the confusion.Which is a pity, as the movie had all the trappings of a great SF movie, but the incoherent plot downgrades it to only ""good"".However I do laud director Kosinski's aim to make Oblivion ""not dark"" -too often ""sci-fi"" is associated with ""horror"", a real turn-off for me -some sort of echo of the ""mad scientist"".

265,JamesIan2021,Beautiful Sci-Fi,8,15 May 2015,"There's always that one film you see where words cannot describe how much you love and enjoy it. The experience leaves you breathless and lost for words, and jaw dropped almost immediately the moment it starts. Well that's me with Oblivion, Tron Legacy director Joseph Kosinski has created the most immersive, stunning and vivid world ravaged by war, and it's populated with gripping characters and knockout action sequences. Tom Cruise is Jack Harper, a Drone repairmen and one of the last men on earth, alongside is Victoria, his computer specialist, who monitors the Drone activity. On a routine zone check Harper discovers a downed vessel, in the wreckage lies Julia Rusakova, a woman that holds a key to his past, and she causes him to question everything he knows about himself and his mission. I love how the story unfolds, showing Jack's normal day tasks and his relationship with Victoria, but as soon as Julia is involved his past comes back to him, events progress and twists and turns are thrown at you from all directions and they shock. There are a lot of lump-in-your-throat scenes that hit hard, mainly in the last thirty minutes. The world of Oblivion looks so real, famous landmarks have fallen and nature has taken over. Whilst it all looks ruined there is a beauty to it, the Superbowl stadium looks incredible as does the destroyed Moon which fills the sky. The Bubble-ship is a stunning piece of craft, I saw the making of the Ship and the way it's been implemented into the film which is wonderful. Tower 49 is visually remarkable and the characters feel melded to the set, it's as if Apple have had a huge input into the films set design! It's a striking movie that is just beautiful, the skies are sun-scorched and it's a sight to behold. The sound design is near perfect too, the sound of the Drone's beeping and scanning is atmospheric and sinister, especially in the abandoned library scene. I think this is Tom Cruise' best performance in years, he's not playing his usual cool and tough guy, Harper is attached to the world he lives in and wants to stay, but Victoria dreams of leaving and going to the tet, a vast and giant tetrahedral space station that orbits Earth. Andrea Riseborough is wonderful, you can just tell how committed she is to the script and how much fun she is having, it's great seeing strong British talent working opposite a Hollywood mega-star! I absolutely love Olga Kurylenko, she still remains my favourite Bond girl and I've seen her in numerous other roles and she is spectacular, but in Oblivion she brings her A-game as every scene she is in there's hard hitting emotion, plus her character is most interesting as she holds the real secret behind Harper's past and the world around him. It's a near perfect movie in my opinion. No movie can be perfect but it can get to the point where it's so close. The action in this movie rocks, the Bubbleship chase in the canyon is edge of your seat excitement, the finale is earth shattering brilliance and I loved the Drone attack in Beech's underground stronghold, but it's after that very attack that Oblivion goes out on a high, so much of a high I'm going to dedicate a whole paragraph towards it! This moment delivers a huge emotional payoff thanks to M83's incredible soundtrack which is the actual reason for the knockout delivery of this scene. The music starts off with a low violin, you know there's a build up coming to something amazing. The mission is almost ruined, so Harper decides to personally take the bomb up to the tet himself, and Julia wants to go with him. As they say their final goodbye locking themselves in the Sleep Pods, the soundtrack kicks in with a techno piano like sound, then as Harper exits the stronghold the big drums ramping up the excitement and then boom come the horns, as he makes his way to finish his mission, the score kicks in, it's wonderful. I got shivers and chills, my jaw dropped, it is the defining moment of the film that hit me the most. You have to see it for yourself to understand the greatness here. An all round near perfect movie experience that I'll never forget. An unforgettable journey filled with mesmerising visuals, stunning soundtracks, top actors and performances and a world like no other, this will be one of my favourite movies of all time.",Oblivion
266,nmholland,One of the Better Movies of 2013,8,27 January 2016,"Oblivion was a well directed, well acted, and well written movie. I enjoyed watching it, for the most part, mostly due to the acting skills of Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman combined with the incredible visual effects.Now, to start off, I've never been a fan of Tom Cruise. Prior to watching Oblivion, I had liked only a few of his movies (War of the Worlds, Edge of Tomorrow, Mission Impossible Anthology, etc.). However, this movie has heightened my respect for the man, and his acting. I definitely think he's a good actor, but he just doesn't have diversity. What do I mean by that? He can only play action. Even though he executes his roles nicely, he doesn't do different ones very often.To give an example, Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks can play any part. He has acted as a mentally retarded man (Forest Gump), a homosexual man with HIV (Philadelphia), a war hero (Saving Private Ryan), and even a lonely crazy dude (Cast Away). Of all the roles listed, he has yet to do bad in any of them. Another good example would be Robin Williams. However, due to his MANY diverse roles, I'm not going to list them all.Next topic: Morgan Freeman. To be honest, I never thought Morgan Freeman could do a Sci-Fi film like this. However, I think he did really good in this movie. The part where the room is dark and he's speaking, and then the lights turn on, and he's sitting back in his chair, smoking a cigar, I was bought. He's really good. I frequently compare him to greats like Harrison Ford or Mel Gibson.Now, Oblivion had a good story line, but it was confusing as heck. This movie honestly confused me more than Inception, and that movie is KNOWN for being confusing. Despite it being confusing, it was still great. I loved that fact that movie had at least five ""ah ha"" moments. Most movies only manage one, but Oblivion really pulled it off. Additional to that, the fact that Jack Harper, Tom Cruise's character, was lied to about so many things, and neither he nor the audience figured it out until we were supposed to, was mind blowing.The last good thing I'd like to mention about this movie was the visual effects. Wow. The visual effects in this movie were some of the best I've seen in a while. There were no moments where you said, ""Wow, that looks fake."" None, at all. And that's really impressive, considering almost every setting was full of visuals. Now, this is due to the movie's huge budget, but it was still amazing.Now, we get into the negatives. The first thing I didn't like about this movie was the scene in the very end when the audience thinks Jack is dead (which, technically, he is), and he turns out to still be alive. The scene is set where Julia, Jack's wife, is playing with her child (presumably Jack's even though no sex is implied between them whatsoever) and she looks over and sees the remaining Scavengers across a small pond. Now, we saw that Jack had died about three years prior to this, in a nuclear explosion. However, we also know that there are plenty of Jacks left on Earth. We actually got to meet one earlier in the movie, who was Jack from Tower 52. This Jack ends up traveling with the Scavengers and finally finding his wife, Julia and their son.Now that I've explained the scene, let me tell you my problems with it. First off, like I said above, it was never implied that Jack and Julia had sex. At all. No morning after scene, no actual sex scene, nothing. But apparently, they had a kid together. That makes no sense whatsoever. People can't have a kid if they haven't done the dirty. That's a fact of life.Second, if Julia woke up at the cabin, which we know she did, how the heck did she get there? My guess was that the Scavengers took her, but if they took her, then why did it take them three years to get to her again? Another problem with them taking her, only Jack knew how to get there, so how would they take her. Pretty big plot hole there. If the Scavengers didn't take her, then who did? Also, if she was there, alone, for so long, how did she have a baby? I've seen a couple baby births in my lifetime, and there are always two or three people nearby the mother to help her. But apparently, Julia can go through labor without any help. Because she's cool like that. And I'm not even going to mention the fact that the kid was at least four or five years old, even though she had only been there for three years.Lastly, the last time we saw Jack 52, he wouldn't listen to anything Jack 49 or Julia had to say. But I guess he was really open minded to the Scavengers, the people he was trained to kill. Overall, the ending scene really confused me. I really wish they could've left it at the destruction of the Tet, and not have the whole ""in the time since"" scene.Well, Oblivion was, overall, really good. I obviously had a few problems with it, but not too many. I liked the plot, and loved the acting. The visual effects were also a big yes for me. It was definitely one of the better movies of 2013. After watching this movie a few times, and thinking about it a lot, I'm going to have to give it a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",Oblivion
267,RolloTomasi,Been there seen that,6,10 May 2013,"IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REASONS NOT TO SEE OBLIVION, THIS IS ONE REVIEW FOR YOU TO READ. IF NOT, SKIP IT. 64 years in the future, Earth is a wasteland after the moon is destroyed by an invading alien army and the war that follows. We won the war but the planet ""was ruined."" A few humans have stayed behind to maintain the water that is left, which is being used for the rest of the human race that relocated to a space station (called Tet) orbiting Earth, or to Titan, a moon of Saturn. Now, depending on your movie taste, that synopsis either makes you roll your eyes and groan or makes you want to hear more. Somebody thought it was a good idea and it became Oblivion. But sometimes a good idea doesn't realize its potential. Such is the case here. It does well through the first half or so. Tom Cruise is Jack (of course) Harper who is a ""drone maintenance tech (so far as he knows)"" left on Earth. Drones fly around protecting, or so Jack is told, these giant water-collecting machines that are sucking all of the planet's seawater and converting it into fusion energy (although it is not made clear how this energy is transferred to Tet)I was never sure. From Tet, a NASA operative named Sally runs the pod show. Jack even has a lovely redheaded British live-in assistant Vicka who's a sort of dispatcher/eye-in-the-sky. Of course, they also provide each other with companionship. So when a transport pod full of sleeping NASA people (just happens to) fall from the sky within sight of where Jack has a secret cabin by a lake, leaving one survivor (the rest are killed by a drone—more on that later), his WIFE, things get complicated. The movie also starts coming apart at its weak seams.Many conventions of sci-fi are present here: The future. Aliens. Apocalypse. Space travel. Delta-sleep. Machines that seem to have their own vengeful personalities. A rag-tag band of survivors who've begun an insurgency against the oppressive aliens (and have a nuke dammit, and are ready to use it). Memory wiped. Clones. The moon destroyed. I'm sure there's more. Which is all fine, as long as it's crafted into a good movie. Not long after we meet Julia, we meet the aforementioned insurgents, led by Beech (Morgan Freeman, who is in every other movie made). Explosions and drone chases through the post-war landscape ensue. It all culminates in a secret plot to sneak a nuclear bomb inside the alien mothership (which turns out to BE the giant triangle above Earth that was supposed to be Mission Control) using one of its drones, reprogrammed. As I said, there are MANY oft-used elements of sci-fi here. Some are PLOT elements seemingly lifted from other sci-fi movies like, say, the (gulp) superior Independence Day. That brings me to my main question about the movie's climax: How is it that these aliens who have radically advanced technology and can detect who a person is just by their DNA and detect their emotions from the inside of a spacecraft—can't detect the 10 nuclear fuel cells it knew were missing on board the ship as well? Just wondering. ID4's nuclear endgame has similar issues but at least it has a sense of cigar-smoking humor about it. And as far as Oblivion goes, ""F—k you, Sally."" That's the best line you could come up with? Really? Bottom line here is that I was disappointed with Oblivion. It's based on a graphic novel and offers striking visuals (SFX and sound design really are great here, the only thing earning it a 5-star rating from me). Its footage makes for a good trailer. Futuristic action and explosions always do. And movie staples like Cruise and Freeman (too bad they needed to ruin the mystery of the Scavs by showing Freeman in the trailers).One thought occurred to me watching Vicka interact with Sally. The story could be an metaphor for how lower-level employees in large companies feel about their bosses. These mysterious, distant, unfeeling pencil and numbers pushers who care nothing for the real work going on in the trenches. They see everyone as the same people (in Oblivion's case, literally) and easily replaceable with the next sucker who comes along.",Oblivion
268,hamidullahgenc,"To sacrifice oneself. Hard work, it is!..",8,16 February 2014,"Real good. This movie is good. I should tell the reasons. First of all, it is made simple and plain. Nearly all scenes are connected to the story. There was nearly no scene irrelevant, nor any scene too long. And we see no crowd conflicting. There was just the movie, bare-naked. Nothing more. About Tom Cruise. He played quite well. He really was a survivor in the movie, not comfortable with his situation, looking for answers, looking for his lost soul. And he let us feel it. About the story. The idea of destruction of life on earth was not alien. But the only thing important about any story is how it is to be processed. And in this case, it was good. Especially the ending. To sacrifice oneself in the cause of maintenance of human life on earth. Very good. Very touching. We need more of this kind of humane scenarios. Really.

The scenery, house and personal plane Cruise used were all interesting and fun as well.But -- Here is the kicker -- It's SLLOOooow. After almost an hour and a half into this film, you still don't know what it's about or where it's going. The last 20 or 30 minutes completely saves the film. All the stuff that was cool to look at wore off in the first hour, then I spent the next half hour bored. It actually winds up being pretty good later and it sums up the story and loose ends fairly nicely and becomes a whole lot more interesting.The problem is, it takes SOOOooo long to get there, that by the time you do, you have to wonder if you even care anymore.

270,EchoMaRinE,Derivative of the movie Moon,7,24 April 2013,"Frankly, the amount of joy you will get out of this movie depends on how familiar you are with SciFi. If you have seen a lot of science fiction movies, you will get bored as hell. The scenario is basically a derivative of the movie Moon. A guy doing some work on a deserted planet starts questioning his existence and past. Then he finds out what he knows as truth has nothing to do with reality. I am not saying the movie is bad but it is too long and I didn't see anything original. Visuals are good. Acting is OK. Story is fine but very predictable. No twist, no surprise.

I think I figured a lot out after 30-40 min and probably a lot do, but I think people want that in a film, even if they say they don't. Excellent put together on this though. Good effects, compelling story, good soundtrack (M83), and overall ownership of the product by Kosinski.I wish I had seen this at theaters. My only criticism is that the plot is a bit thin as far as details go....or rather, not as believable but that is Sci Fi anyhow, right? Honestly, I think a lot of the ideas, colors, and theme mimic star wars movies a bit though it is not a star wars clone at all. If you look at the 'bad guys' the black and white color and flight abilities are like star wars. I guess it is hard for sci fi flicks to define themselves quite separately. I think it also borrows from movies like Memento.",Oblivion
272,J-bot6,Talking' 'bout my generation,7,7 August 2016,"** This review kind of contains spoilers **I watched this again recently and I liked it even more the second time. While I agree that this film isn't totally original, I really don't mind. Even the films that a number of people claim that this ""rips off"" did the same thing themselves. Those films also lifted ideas from previous works (like Silent Running, which the director flat-out mentions in the production video). Perhaps people should be less concerned with originality and more with whether or not the film resonated with them. In this case, I'm even more willing to let some things slide since I see a huge influence here from Saberhagen's Berserker series of stories. I may actually be the first reviewer to mention this connection. If that's the case, there are a lot of people who really should go out and read more books. I'm happy to see anything that resembles his works on screen. This is also why I really enjoyed the end sequence for this film. Nicely done. The pacing of the film was fine. I can appreciate a film that takes its time. The look of the film was pretty cool too, in fact it reminds me of Syd Mead's American Steel paintings. The score was pretty good and had some really inventive elements. However, it was the sound design that really was remarkable -- especially for drones (very cool). It's rare that I see good sound design in modern films. Thankfully they spent the time to nail down those details. Acting was fine. I didn't see any glaring issues. It was suitable for the genre. Visual effects were mostly seamless. Again, nothing glaringly problematic. Cinematography was good, although not to the level of Geoffrey Unsworth or Jordan Cronenweth. To that end, this film feels more like a big episode of the Twilight Zone than like a massive epic film. Regardless, it's an enjoyable watch. If you approach this as a sci-fi short story that was adapted to the screen, you'll likely enjoy it (especially if you've read your share of 60s and 70s science fiction). I should mention that I'm the same age as and have a similar background to the director, so perhaps that's contributing to my affinity to this film.",Oblivion
273,FilmFanatic03,"A beautiful and sophisticated sic-fi blockbuster, with a hint of blandness...",6,5 May 2013,"Referencing to the Tom Cruise canon, Oblivion is a stronger effort than Jack Reacher. Mr. Cruise can still make taking down the bad guys look cool, however this is not his finest hour yet it is far from his worst. Oblivion has an eerie and beautiful feeling in regards to the scenery and visuals. The whole production design was sophisticated and had a crisp feel to it. Overall however, I feel that Oblivion had the potential to be a strong outing for Joseph Kosinski yet the third act did not deliver. The film starts out as a simplistic and imposing, Jack Harper (Cruise) feels a strange connection with planet earth and has doubts about migrating to Titan with Victoria (Riseborough) How the film dealt with Harper's connection with a planet lost from the grasp of hope and life allowed me to engage with the film. Yet, the second half of the film felt like it escalated at a quite rapid pace and the conclusion felt slightly rushed. Oblivion should have stayed with its personal and raw approach rather than levelling it up to a hashed conclusion. The action is not being criticised, but it should have been dealt with a more steady pace. Apart from that, Oblivion is a decent sic-fi which does provide some form of excitement. Focusing on the positives, the soundtrack gave Oblivion a sense of depth and the potential for the film to be epic.Oblivion is far from a disaster, it's just failed to reach for the heights of an epic sic-fi blockbuster.",Oblivion
274,Paul-271,Sunglasses Again,1,24 June 2021,"I gave up on this one after a series of events. Tom Cruise's character makes a remarkably bone headed decision that lands him in a dark cave. If he remained intelligent, the plot would not go on. He's in great danger from the apparent bad guys that ate the moon and triggered an atomic war that ruined the Earth.And who does he meet in this DARK cave on a devastated Earth? Why Morgan Freeman wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar. I'd say at this point it was 30/70 favoring Morgan that he'd be the one instead of Laurence Fishburne but it had to be one because it'd been too long a white's only show.Of course he had to look all cool and all.I'm tired of the idiocy.

275,aldri-feb,Excellent blockbuster movie of 2013!,6,14 April 2013,"'Oblivion' is a massive and stunning sci-fi movie. Joseph Kosinski as director once again entertains audience with cool and thrilling scenes which he had done it before in 'Tron: Legacy'. The plot itself is quite alike with Tron: tense at the beginning and becoming slow after the second half. There are also great stuff in cinematography, score and visual effects. The cinematography makes this movie more alive and beautiful, the score is very loud that increases the tense in this movie. The casts also not disappointing, especially Tom Cruise as leading actor though it's not his best ever performance. Tom Cruise is suitable when he acts in action movies. He is a cool and good looking guy which won't make people feel bored watching him and also give profit for this movie.At some points, 'Oblivion' is not original movie. The ideas could be coming from some movies like 'Wall-E' or 'Alien: Trilogy'. The storyline is really ridiculous and non-sense, the ending is also a little bit disappointing. Besides that thing, 'Oblivion' is still a good and entertaining action movie. So far, it's one of the best blockbuster movie this year. Definitely better than other disappointing movies recently like 'A Good Day to Die Hard', 'OZ the Great and Powerful' and 'G.I.Joe: Retaliation'.",Oblivion

I thought it was a really good Sci-Fi flick, good story line, good pacing. My friend and I never once found ourselves board. They did a good job of telling the story. It starts off with the future and throughout the movie you find exactly what happened. Tom Cruise is kind of like a more ""action"" oriented Wall-E. As he and his manager are left to fix the drones that roam the earth. And you know, with any destitute place you always will have a monkey wrench thrown into the mix, but its a really good monkey wrench. Its a gorgeously looking picture and the thing about Sci-Fi vs action for me is that is about, could it be believable.. and I say yes. It has good action scenes in it as well. I compare it to Prometheus and it has better pacing and more action than that movie, although they have about the same scale. I recommend seeing it on a large screen because the scale of the imagery and the job at hand is really beautiful. I saw it on an IMAX screen.",Oblivion
278,jillbeckinheim7,Not great sorry,4,20 October 2021,"Not great sorry....The premise of ""Oblivion"" is difficult to accept without hoisting your eyebrows. Most of planet Earth sprawls in ruins after the mother of all wars. Aliens identified only as 'Scavengers' have blasted away half of the Moon. Afterward, Mother Nature raised Hell itself with every cataclysm you can imagine. What Mother Nature and the aliens didn't bring to this apocalyptic smackdown, Earth provided in the form of nuclear weapons. We're informed that Earth repulsed the extraterrestrials, but the devastation has prompted mankind to pack up for Saturn's largest moon Titan. Meantime, Earth's survivors have masterminded an enormous tetrahedral space station known simply as the Tet. Imagine the Death Star from the ""Star Wars"" franchise orbiting Earth. This Tet can launch dozens of spherical drones that resemble the ball turret gunners on vintage B-17 Flying Fortresses from World War II. Jack keeps these heavily-armed, drones airborne and the drones fly sorties to safeguard mega-gigantic hydro rigs sucking water out of Earth's ocean. These rigs are extracting the last useful minerals that will be shipped off to Titan. However, there is one catch. The Scavengers haven't entirely surrendered, and these guerrilla factions menace Jack and company. Nevertheless, Jack and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) live together in blissful ignorance on a towering house far above Earth's surface and conduct their assigned routines.",Oblivion
279,DubhDoo,"Unoriginal, but enjoyable sci-fi",6,20 April 2013,"Despite being marketed as both ""groundbreaking"" and ""original"", 'Oblivion is neither. Joseph Kosinki's follow-up to 2010's surprisingly likable 'Tron Legacy', contains elements of so many sci-fi movies that we've seen before – there's 'Total Recall', '2001: a Space Odyssey', 'Moon', 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', 'Planet of the Apes' etc. There's a good chance that you may have seen at least one of those and thus, you will probably recognise something from them in 'Oblivion'. However, that's not to say this is a bad film by any means – it's not – but it isn't anything remotely new.In an opening voice-over, Tom Cruise's character Jack Harper outlines how a group of aliens called Scavengers (nicknamed 'Scavs') obliterated half of the moon and engaged in a war with the people of Earth, who eventually won the war with the use of nuclear weapons, which consequently damaged the planet's ecosystem. The majority of the Earth's population consequently embarked on a giant spacecraft. Jack Harper, one of only two people left on the planet, is a repairman who fixes drones to help rebuild the Earth's ecosystem. Yes, sort of like a human version of 'WALL-E'. However, when a mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) falls from the sky (literally), Harper begins to question all he knew.Cruise, a perfectly fine screen presence, holds the screen very well and remains a consistently engaging figure throughout. His performance here is nothing to champion his work in 'Magnolia' or 'Born on the Fourth of July', but he makes Harper a likable lead. Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough try their best with the material, despite being given two arguably underwritten roles. Morgan Freeman unfortunately, is wasted with little more to do than act as Basil Exposition, although to be fair, no one delivers exposition quite like Freeman. Nikolaj Coaster Waldau is similarly wasted, which is a shame, given his ever-great turn as Jaime Lannister in 'Game of Thrones'.What helps the film greatly are its Claudio Miranda-shot visuals which are truly spectacular, from the pristine white of the sky tower's interior where Harper lives to the sight of the Brooklyn Bridge dangling between two sides of a chasm. The use of Iceland as the film's shooting location makes a nice change from many other sci-fi movies, with the country's natural beauty stunningly captured. 'Oblivion' is on a similar level to 'Tron Legacy'; it contains solid performances and strong visuals that manage to overcome a mediocre script, however its disappointingly ordinary M83 soundtrack doesn't rival Daft Punk's scoring on the latter. Overall, it's nothing you haven't seen before (aside from the beautiful Icelandic vistas), but if you want solidly enjoyable sci-fi action that's never boring, you got it.",Oblivion
280,hazysistersunshine33,Pure Science Fiction,7,5 May 2014,"Tom Cruise is a futuristic astronaut of sorts salvaging the rest of earth's resources after some big war with Aliens. Humans win the war, but the earth is unlivable, so everyone packs up and goes to some other planet or moon or something, I forget, but its atmosphere is compatible for us. Or is that what's going on? It keeps you guessing enough to be interested and answers your question sufficiently at the end. You do wonder what the heck is really going on here for a good part of the movie, but it's not so confusing that you lose interest. The concept kind of reminds me of After Earth, but Oblivion is better and takes an interesting turn whereas After Earth is pretty boringly straight forward. Say what you want to about Tom Cruise, he does get pretty good rolls and he does a pretty good job in the end. I was satisfied with the explanation and I Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, from Game of Thrones were good in it, but Morgan Freeman is great I everything.

The cinematography and special effects are without a doubt the best thing about this movie. It also has some cool sci-fi ideas taken straight from other sci-fi movies like Moon and 2001 A Space Odyssey, but with that being said, the plot is just mediocre and not very well executed. The characters are flat, the movie takes a while to actually get going, and the cool ideas are not fully explored.This movie has a resistance plot with a character played by Morgan Freeman, but his character and the resistance plot isn't fully explored. It tries to build a romantic relationship but the two characters have no chemistry, and their relationship isn't fully explored. It also involves cloning, but that part of the movie isn't explored either. This movie incorporates so many cool ideas, but the filmmakers seemed too lazy to fully explore them . Instead, we're left with a mostly uninteresting plot that involves Tom Cruise wandering about, stumbling on new revelations about the plot. Also, it tries to have some huge emotional and epic ending, but I didn't care enough about the characters and plot to feel any emotion towards the movie. With the visuals and the amount of cool ideas, this would've be a masterpiece if it was in the hands of a better director and writer like Christopher Nolan or Alex Garland.",Oblivion

284,slayerjmk95,A Fantastic and Note-worthy Experience of Good SF,8,11 April 2013,"In the world of science fiction, there have been many stories that have been adapted to the point where we've just grown tired of the same old stuff, but sometimes, someone comes along and re-creates that story with great vision and excellence. Oblivion is one of these movies, offering different and unique plot points, fantastic acting, phenomenal visuals and directing that is pitch-perfect. Following an alien invasion, 60 years have passed, and Earth is now a wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), a member of team 49, goes around repairing drones, which canvas the planet and eliminate the aliens still there. But when Jack is captured by a human resistance leader on Earth (Morgan Freeman), he is told that everything he knows is a lie, and that something is very, very wrong. He sides with these mysterious rebels, and begins to fight for not just love, but for his home.Joseph Kosinski, the director and co-writer, as well as writer of the graphic novel the film is based on, creates a truly fantastically frightening world with Oblivion. His direction in many scenes is so smooth and crisp that you forget, this is only is second film. The acting is superb, with Tom Cruise being at the height of his game after doing the well-made thriller Jack Reacher, based off of Lee Child's novel. I can understand why people were upset with Morgan Freeman's short screen time, but at least he was in it. I still came to love his character because he was an important one; he made Jack see reality. Olga Kurylenko was great in her role as the mysterious woman who knows Jack from his past. The visual effects, once again, were stunning, with the post-apocalyptic Earth being truly remarkable and extremely detailed. But the aliens were a true treat in the film, being very unique and different. Now, while I see many people trying to find ways of lowering the rating for the film, like movie connections, I can say, the connections are incredibly vague and little. Those who claim this is too close to ""The Matrix"", it's not. Humans were enslaved, and used as batteries by machines. In Oblivion, we are nearly extinct, and aliens have come and gone. Jack Harper is a curious individual, while Neo was content with ""his"" reality. Malcolm Beech was a leader, but had limits, while Morpheus had zero. I could keep going, but that just takes away from the review. The music by M83 was just spectacular; a must-listen and own for anyone who appreciates musical soundtracks and scores.Overall, Oblivion is a great addition to a constantly growing sci-fi universe that has had great additions in the past five years alone, and more to come. This is not a film for everyone, being a straight-up science fiction film, but for anyone who loves action, sci-fi or good filmmaking. Now, I do see a few award-worthy things about Oblivion, including Tom Cruise's acting, M83's musical score and the visual effects, but mainly this is just one to be seen and acknowledged for its greatness for expanding the genre, and adding a fresh and creative vision to the mix, but not a contender for Best Picture, sadly, falling just short of that, but still a better film of the year.9/10 Stars***",Oblivion

As the writer-director Kosinski weaved an intricate narrative that questions the correlation between memories, love and the human identity in this post-apocalyptic future.The production design is reminiscent of Moon and Alien, whilst the minimalist cast and setting work well with the theme of isolation and 'last humans on Earth'. I would love to live in Jack Harper's Zen-like residence above the clouds.There are so many homages to classic sci-fi films such as Logan's Run, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Silent Running, Total Recall to modern ones like Moon and War of the Worlds.The music is excellent and has a nostalgic vibe to it. The cast and acting are well performed and consistent. Although I think there is a little pacing issue especially during the lake cabin scenes. And perhaps a lack of chemistry between Kurylenko and Cruise, but the storyline makes up for it.But overall, Oblivion has become another favourite of mine, and deserve to enter the hall of classic sci-fi films for the ages.",Oblivion

For this movie, let me echo the other reviewers who say ""Don't read any spoilers!"" There are a bunch of twists that I never saw coming, and one of them might be somewhat predictable but is eminently satisfying, anyway. The film deals with a two-person team (Cruise and Andrea Riseborough) assigned to operate drones that are mopping up the remnants of an alien invasion as well as guarding various machines. Things are not what they seem, which you know if you've watched any trailers, and the movie would otherwise be a live action version of ""Wall-e."" It's how things aren't what they seem that's interesting. The Earth has been devastated, buried by lava flows and sand. These are curiously scenery-conserving catastrophes. We see the Capitol and Washington Monument partly buried, but no hint of any other ruins. The Pentagon is cratered but there are no other ruins nearby. The desolation was filmed in Iceland and the film made effective use of Iceland's scenery. Ten out of ten?

The plot is confusing and very very thin - in the back of your mind you're thinking of the most obvious resolution to the movie, but you're led to believe that there should be more to it than what you're thinking, by the end of the movie though, you'll discover that you were right all along. You'll be thinking: ""Is THAT it?!"" It's really really predictable.

The red lights on the drones were from Hal 2001 a Space Odyssey as was the name of the craft they were in. There were enough holes in the script that you could pilot a craft through them. And lets not talk about how terribly slow this picture moved. If we had to watch another New York flashback to hit us over the head with the relationship between Jack and Julia I was going to scream.

299,Astralan,Good popcorn flick.,8,20 April 2013,"Joseph Kosinski created and co-penned Oblivion 8 years ago, and reported to his opinion his ""debut"" movie. Oblivion was is a graphic novel, illustrated by Andrée Wallin. However he got his feet wet at Disney first with the release of Tron Legacy where he proved to be a competent director. However, Disney dumped Joseph. I hope it makes Universal a ton of money.The story boast of a world that can no longer sustain life and is being dismantled for what properties it does have: Water. Nearly 90% of the planet is is radioactive from a war between aliens and man, which resulted in the destruction of the Earths moon. The premise is set around aliens still surviving on the planet that want to interfere with the plans to remove the planets water. Drones are set in place to protect the massive units that are set about the task of sucking up all it can. When a drone is down, a skeletal crew that populate various areas of the inhabitable part of the planet to find and fix the drones. Know this, the drones are not particularly people friendly. Enter Tom Cruise.At 50, Cruise is well preserved, easily pairing up with the beautiful Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko. As plots within plots slowly unfold, I found myself thinking ""Whaat?"" at times only to answer my own question with ""Eh, OK. I'll roll with that"". Eventually, more people enter the foray and you realize there is more to the planet then was first let on. Enter Morgan Freeman. Thank god he's not narrating the movie! The scope is epic, the feel is lonely, and the color quite gray for the most part. There is a strong storyboard presence throughout, and no doubt Andrée Wallins conceptualizations are the primary influence. Keep your eyes open for tons of sci/fi homage. That in its self made for some moments of ""aha"" and a slight grin. Definitely a PG13, but there was thankfully no adult content, just some moments of violence. See it in a good theater.

300,mistabobdobolina,Diverting... if you don't think about it too hard.,6,1 September 2013,"Oblivion is well-produced, pretty, and well-acted by all its principals, and it features some reasonably suspenseful action sequences. Under the hood, it's also derivative, shoddily constructed and ultimately nonsensical.So, one possible method of enjoyment is to just try to keep yourself from thinking too much about how its pieces get together. Fail to do this, and you might notice (severe spoilers): It is never satisfactorily explained why the villain-creature of the piece -- an unsubtle cross between the monoliths and the HAL supercomputer both stolen from 2001: A Space Odyssey -- needed to expend so much energy and effort sucking up Earth's oceans. Why not just go to Mars which has ice-caps and no extant civilization to contend with? The technical explanation we're given is ""power,"" but how much power is it expending to do what it's been doing for fifty years? It is never really explained why the villain-creature of the piece needed human clones to do its bidding. If it can build sophisticated automated drones, why can't it build other machines to tend them? Why did it even need an army of clone Tom Cruises to conquer the planet, as recounted by Morgan Freeman (whose character, I see from the credits, was supposed to be named Beech)? The only explanation for this in sight is the Grandiosity Clause that Cruise must surely have in his contract: the plot as constructed makes him the most important human in the universe, on whose decisions depend everyone's survival or destruction. Frankly it feels a bit forced.I get that Jack Harper was supposed to have residual memories because they'd somehow been embedded in his genetic code or something by cloning, but I feel like we're getting to the point where SF movies can start acknowledging that this is Not How Memory Works.If you can overlook the above, the cast and director really do manage to wring some pathos out of what essentially is a mish-mash of hand-me-down premises, and Oblivion is visually impressive to boot.

This movie has all the beats and pacing and budget, but there's no heart or substance to latch onto. It's like an A. I. wrote this movie.",Oblivion
304,haosstoposto,Predictable Sci-Fi,7,17 April 2013,"My expectations for this movie were not very high but it was a solid piece of entertainment. Tom Cruise obviously loves sci-fi and he apparently found himself in this movie genre. He had strong Co-Star in this movie – Morgan Freeman – who would compel the audience even if he only read stock market bulletin. The photography in the movie is beautiful, the Earth never looked better in ruins, and female co-stars are also nice. And the audience have one or two surprises for them. But the weak point of the movie is it's predictability. Not only for the hard-core sci-fi fans. The plot is as follows: There was an extraterrestrial invasion. Enemy first destroyed the Moon and as a consequence there were massive natural disasters on Earth. Earth did fight back, launched it's nuclear weapons and defeated the enemy. The planet itself was ravaged and the remaining aliens fled into hiding on Earth. The remnant human population built an enormous base/spaceship – the Tet and they want to collect all the water from Earth and travel to Saturns moon Titan. Tom Cruise is Jack, the last mechanic on the planet and his job is to repair the combat drones which protect gigantic water collectors for the trip to Titan. He has a partner/lover – Victoria. And they live in a sterile flight control tower. And every now and then they have their minds wiped – for security reasons and Jack has strange recurring dreams/memories. Of course, everything looks suspicious from the beginning. The Tet itself looks incredibly non-human-made, especially when we see that the entire civilization lies in ruins. The great plan of the humanity – to move to Titan is beyond comprehension. What in the world could the mankind find there!? If they said Mars, maybe I would believed it. The communication with the Tet is also strange, main controller looks like an automaton. And of course the sterile environment in which Jack and Victoria live is also inhuman. No trace of individuality, but that at least has a logical explanation. We soon see that the war still goes on and that the humanity lives now underground, hiding from killer-drones, which Jack repairs. They have a plan – straight from Independence Day"" – to plant a nuclear device inside the Tet. And they succeed, of course. There are some surprising subplots which I will not reveal here. And sadly, in the end, very little is revealed about the alien invader, it's origin or motivation, but never mind. Whatever the explanation might be, we (the audience) have already seen it somewhere.",Oblivion

However this can make a movie interesting and can place the viewer in the same place as the main character. This is what happens with 'Oblivion', a movie based on a graphic novel portraying Earth being ravaged due to war and natural disasters. Two people are sent back to extract Earth's remaining resources before heading back to our new planet. The movie is powerful and visually stunning with Tom Cruise in vintage form. As the film unravels, it becomes compelling viewing as many questions about our own existence and being 'human' is asked. This is a sci-film for the ages, which sells itself on being very intelligent.",Oblivion

A Missed Opportunity,3,6 July 2013,"Oblivion** (out of 4)124 mins/ 12Cast: Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea RiseboroughDirector: Joseph KosinskiPlot: Jack Harper is a drone repairman working on a post-apocalypse Earth. With only a few days until he leaves the planet, Jack discovers a crashed spacecraft, which leads him to the truth about how Earth was brought to its knees. JJ's Verdict: Tom Cruise has hit a career low in this bore-fest. The first hour of the film just sees him flying around his designated area, repairing drones and talking about boring Super Bowl matches to his wife (Andrea Riseborough, the film's only bright spark). This would be okay if we were treated to an hour of explosive non-stop action after this but we're not. There is more talking and even when the few action sequences come along they are mainly dull and somehow uninteresting. The filmmakers' have taken a good concept and, although made its scenery and effects very nice to look at, put in absolutely no character development. I was going to accept this film when Morgan Freeman came in and delighted us with his presence but his role is little more than a few minutes long. And don't even ask me what was happening in the last half an hour. The film rushed key plot elements meaning the film was extremely hard to follow.

308,trevor-mcinsley,Surprisingly Good,9,31 January 2014,I say surprising because it has been a while since I have seen any decent or otherwise unique sci-fi films. So many of the modern ones have a tendency to either be dumbed down to hell to cater to a wider audience or get so convoluted and tangled up trying to be clever that they simply become unwatchable messes (aka: The Cloud Atlas Effect).I went into this film thinking it would be bad. Generally when you cast A list celebrities in sci-fi it tends to have that effect on a film. I rewatched War of the Worlds recently and was amazed at how silly the whole thing was and partly that was down to Tom Cruise.Thankfully that does not happen here. Besides from this film seeming like a little bit of an over the top male fantasy at times and giving the female characters very little depth or independence it is good nonetheless. Tom Cruise himself doesn't really lend much to the character and he feels kind of weak but as it turns out... that is sort of the point all along and actually fits in with the plot.It didn't exactly feel like anything special at first but it threw out a good few twists that I actually did not see coming for once. I know this is sounding negative but that is only because I am surprised to find that the film was ultimately pretty good.,Oblivion

It was a good movie.Here in Oblivion we don't have anything! Or maybe I should say we have too much but nothing at the same time!OK, let me give you an idea of this: take the Wall-E plot made poorly, put a mix of The Dark Knight and Inception from Christopher Nolan as a soundtrack, with tiny bits of special sound effects from 2001 A Space Odyssey, steal concepts like Hal-9000 and the Monolith from 2001 again, Michael Bay it all the way (or you can also say, add some excrement to the mix) with famous actors like Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman to give it some credibility, render it all with astonishing special effects with unoriginal concepts, have a payoff that basically copies Moon from Duncan Jones and you have... Oblivion!Yes, it's a HACK! It's all about hacking famous and well developed concepts and turn this collage into a movie!To (not) add up, the characters are forgettable, the dialogue is atrocious and clichéd to death and... no, that's all you have! This sums up pretty well the movie.Of course, the visual effects are stunning, but again, it doesn't add up!Tom Cruise, man, honestly... fire your agent immediately!

The character's actions help drive the plot but you never really feel a connection with them or a reason to root for them.

Tom certainly has gained my appreciation, his powerful performance in Magnolia deserved an Oscar for best supporting actor and his role in Eyes Wide Shut deserved an Oscar for Best Actor (I can name others as well). His portfolio stands out and I can name most of his undertakings by heart! His performance in Oblivion was superb and despite some minor weaknesses in the story line it was a thoroughly entertaining and suspenseful dramatic handful that I've returned to on several occasions. Kudos Tom, I look forward to anything you appear in! In my humble opinion you are at the peak of your profession! The Oblivion Iceland scenery is incredible (despite there being CGI sprinkled in) so come for the scenery but stay for the movie!

313,sedativchunk,21st century sci fi masterpiece with Tom Cruise at his best,10,11 August 2013,"I'm not even sure where to begin. But let me say this; whether you are or are not a fan of Tom Cruise or science fiction films, you should do yourself a favor and see this movie. Oblivion is probably the best science fiction film of the 21st century so far.Oblivion, without spoiling any major parts of the film, is a movie that takes place in roughly 60 years in the future. Earth is a savage wasteland ruined by nuclear war with an alien race. Most of the human race is said to have relocated to another world. Two people whom are a couple (with their past memories and life experiences erased) manage a high-tech station in the sky on Earth. Their daily routine consist of ""cleaning up"" Earth by eliminating leftover aliens on the surface after the war using cybernetic killing drones. The main character Jack (played by Tom Cruise) goes out daily to repair drones that have been shot down or damaged.After a series of events unfold, Jack starts to discover the truth about the drones, the aliens, and himself. He learns that his mission is not what it was said to be. That's as far as my explanation can go without spoiling this film. Oblivion is based off of a novel, which I have not read, but after seeing this film I would love to pick it up sometime to see the similarities between each.Go see this film! Whether you are young or old, male or female, a fan of science fiction or not, there is something in this movie for anyone. Intense, action-packed combat scenes, state-of-the-art CGI, a telling and though-provoking storyline, a nice romantic subplot, and a SUPERB cast. Everything in this film was done perfect; music, picture, and the works, and everything was paced just right. Lastly whether you are a fan or not of Tom Cruise and the antics in his personal life, this is probably his best movie. Great acting, believable scenes and the supporting cast nailed it. Olga Kurylenko, Andresa Riseborough, and the legendary Morgan Freeman were the perfect choices for this film. Very few movies I give a perfect review for, this one gets it. 10/10.",Oblivion

Having only directed Tron Legacy(which was only a moderate success) ,he was able to get $120 million to write/direct/produce his pet project. This is a huge privilege that some directors spend decades trying to obtain, but Kosinksi did it in his second outing. And not only that, but he also got some heavy hitting actors like Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman on board to further convince us that this should be a one of a kind movie from the mind of a single person(a rarity in Hollywood). Based on everything we've seen, the movie looks beautiful, but has also played things pretty close to the chest in terms of story. Does Kosinski produce an incredible story that lives up to his creative ambition, or does this sci-fi miss the creativity and land in the realm of obscurity?Read the full review: http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/oblivion-review/",Oblivion

As for everything else it's just a mediocre movie that could have been much more.The film in brief, involves Tom Cruise and another companion assigned to drain the earth of it's resources mainly focusing on the oceans and taking the water.A few events take place that makes Tom Cruise question the mission and who he really is.The acting was o.k. from most of the characters and a few weak attempts of humor from time to time. I am not sure why Morgan Freeman is listed as one of the main characters in the movie because he is really only in the movie for a good 15 minutes at best and it really wasn't something that was memorable.

Some people will moan about any film and pick things out, compare them with other films, moan about taking parts from other films, my advice is to just sit back, relax and enjoy the film and take it for what it is.

317,aequus314,Ugh... generic big studio property. Bit of a downer — average at best and yawn worthy at times,4,24 April 2013,"Joseph Kosinski's follow-up to his 2010 film Tron: Legacy (which I really enjoyed); is a stunning and eargasmic feast for those who like expensive effects. For everybody else, overall treatment of this science fiction mystery is dull and uninspiring.I'll do without PC geek speak and use layman language.The time is 2077 and decades earlier, an attack by aliens known as ""Scavengers"" rendered our planet uninhabitable. So human beings relocate to a space station in Titan, and send machines back here to extract whatever natural resources are left. The plot in Oblivion involves Jack (not Reacher), an engineer stationed here to repair and maintain robots that patrol the bosoms of Mother Earth. Now, the main objective of these robots (aka ""Drones"") is terminate any leftover ""Scavs"" that may threaten the human outfit. Paired with icy communications officer and girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), Jack also provides tech support to the extraction machines. They have two more weeks before the mission completes, but massive explosions happen one day and Jack uncovers heinous truth.At the risk of spoiling everything, the events that follow are devastatingly predictable and a paste-up of elements from the following genre titles:1) Total Recall — memory wipe and restoration of a romantic past with flashes of cheesy nostalgia in NYC with female astronaut Julia (Olga Kurylenko)2) I, Robot — conspiracies leading up to a showdown with omnipotent A.I. villain, Sally (Melissa Leo)3) The Matrix — no prize for guessing who's the chosen one after Jack's encounter with guerrilla leader of the human resistance, Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman)Now for the tangible: territorial space and atmosphere created by DP Claudio Miranda, is reminiscent of the vastness seen in Prometheus — a disappointment considering his innovative photography n in earlier project, Life of Pi. Character and set designs also evoke traces of kinetics found in 2001 Space Odyssey and Wall-E. Toss airborne battles and cloning tragedies in the mix; essentially, Oblivion is a generic big studio property screaming sentiments about drone wars and global warming.It has the epic looks and formalist style of something very impressive.

Well, he doesn't have to worry about saving the earth in this movie because it is already dealt with.The movie starts with a brief story of our moon's end, resulting catastrophe, shifting the entire planet to Titan (Saturn's largest moon) and the ongoing fight with the so-called Scavengers, all narrated by Cruise himself.Clearly Cruise himself agrees that his memory has been wiped after the war to protect the classified information from falling into the wrong hands. Everything goes like clockwork until a shuttle crashes and what happens next makes Cruise doubt everything.If I add word more than that, you will curse me for this review.

This movie is a unique blend of various emotional coefficients like Love, Self realization, Sacrifice & Poetry (Yes, in a Tom Cruise movie).The visual effects have been the heart and soul of this movie. You will find the ruins of Empire State, Golden Gate Bridge and if you have your eyes peeled, you may even notice the torch of the Statue of Liberty (in the canyons in the chasing sequence). Since this is a post apocalyptic script, grey dominates more than any other color, but you won't get the irritation out of it because it is well balanced by the High Tech gadgets, drones and a house which everyone wants to put their name on.The cast have done a pretty decent job and as a result the movie looks even more presentable.

324,PhilipGHarris,Great look and acting but plot holes galore,7,21 April 2013,"Whilst beautifully shot and acted Oblivion suffers from some gaping plot holes which may leave the viewer cold. If even some of these could have been plugged with clever lines of dialogue, and often this is all they need, then the whole film would have been a more impressive and engaging experience. To discuss these more fully we need to consider the big reveal the film offers: The fact the Tet, a vast monolith floating above Earth in order to manage the last evacuation of the planet, is actually an alien hell bent on sucking the planet dry of energy. Having floated into our solar system approximately seventy years prior to events in the film the Tet is encountered by a human ship which is exploring the possibility of colonising Titan. It sucks the ship in and then clones the two woken crew members – sent back as armies to destroy humanity so it can absorb Earth's energy.Immediately a few problems come to mind. Is Earth really the most energy rich planet in the solar system and why has it failed to wipe out mankind by sending down hundreds of drones, clearly seen within the Tet in the final sequences? The excuse that stealth technology has kept the survivors on Earth secure simply failing to hold water for the period they have been in hiding, especially since there is no discussion as to where they are getting their food from.The film revolves around Jack (Cruise) coming to terms with the fact that something is broken in the world. He has no real love with Victoria (a really great performance from Riseborough) and has memories of Earth, and another woman, from well before the war. Jack and Victoria have both had their memories prior to the previous five years removed, something they fail to question to any great degree, or the film fails to explain away well – wouldn't one be concerned about this? As he completes his last tour an ancient Earth ship makes planet fall and Jack disobeys orders to investigate. This is the remains of the ship that the Tet originally pulled Victoria and himself from – the pair ejecting the rest of the crew - and contains Jack's wife. Rescuing her from the drones, who destroy all the other cryogenic pods, Jack starts to remember what happened, assisted towards the very end of the film, by the flight recorder which reminds him what happened. Another plot thread in the film concerns the fact that love transcends all. Jack (a clone) and his wife find some tender moments when she overcomes the fact he isn't quite the same person she originally knew. Jack realising his own state when encountering another clone of himself who is doing the same job he does in a restricted zone. Whilst this plot is played out nicely in the main you wonder how many Jack's are left on Earth? Even though the clone who survives the film events returns to his ""wife"" it does beg the question of whether she can accept that a whole bunch more may be arriving from across Earth to return to a normal relationship – something the film decides to ignore, rather than address.In the final sequences Jack and Beech (Freeman) take a vast bomb onto the Tet to blow it to kingdom come. For some reason the Tet does not see the bomb, simply not explained again, and it raises the question of how this vast intelligence has survived so long when it appears to be so stupid.With all these criticisms I go back to the salient points raised, the film looks lovely and is well acted. The only characters I felt were underdeveloped, and could have used more explanation, were Beech and especially Sykes, and understanding the scavenegers (surviving humans) better would have improved the feel of the film. Oblivion has a lot going for it, just don't think too deeply about what is happening.",Oblivion

Perhaps the visual part, the ""atmosphere"", obscures the story and characters, however the story itself is pretty intriguing, and the characters are interesting. Avoidance of the excessive dynamics is an advantage - this is what clearly distinguishes ""Oblivion"" among the modern sci-fi genre, separating the thoughtful viewer from an emotions consumer, and giving to the first one time to reflect, and to the second one time to get bored and disappointed.

327,megoobee,Fairly unsatisfying movie,6,13 August 2013,"This is one of those movies that starts off appearing enjoyable but becomes terribly disappointing as it progresses. The storyline is fairly simple – In the aftermath of a great war against an alien enemy, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable. To survive, mankind has escaped to another world but a few humans remain to tend the massive energy harvesting machines left behind. To make things difficult, a few surviving aliens have also remained and try to create havoc where ever they can.It's hard not to notice the behavior of the three primary characters, strange, wooden and unfeeling. Whether it was intentional or just bad acting, it effectively gave away the plot twists and secrets of the story long before they are revealed. You know that everyone and everything is not as they appear and by the time the movies hits its proverbial stride, you will have already correctly guessed everything that will happen.The film is 2 hours in length but loses its entertainment value near the half hour mark. The story is incredibly predictable and has laughable plot holes that make no sense at all. For instance, how do the clones share memories? They are independent of each other but yet they seemingly share memories at the lake scene at the end. (If you haven't seen the movie, I won't give away what this means.)

The movie has a few entertaining action sequences and a few interesting action set pieces. I thought that the combination of sf, romance, action, mystery and drama was interesting and that it made Oblivion a stylish genre film. The movie also has a few great and unexpected plot twists, a few memorable quotes and a few scenes with beautifully sustained awe. The scene where Tom Cruise meets up for the first time with a clone of himself is an example of it. When I first saw that scene my mind got so bombed up because I didn't expect this part of the story to come at all and it was a complete surprise to me as well as strange and I didn't even know what on Earth's name was going on even as Jack defeated the other Jack and went inside his Bubble Ship. When I first saw a second Tom Cruise in the movie I started shouting in my head out loud ""Hey!? What on earth!?"" and ""Wait! Is it Cruise's character's future self having somewhat come back to the past!?"" This plot twist was so original, so great, so surprising, unexpected, breathtaking, strange and incomprehensible that I started considering it to be the most beautifully sustained awe moment that I've ever experienced in any movies in my entire life in memory. The story kept me interested all the way through to the end of the film. I felt that the cameo appearance of the devastated Statue of the Liberty was unnecessary because it has already been used in a few or more disaster movies, making it clichéd. Another problem was the score sound when the Oblivion title showed up on screen because this score sound reminded me of Inception. Though Oblivion is not a great film so I can recommend it to you I still recommend it to you to see and add it in my MUST-SEE list of movies because many of the movie's elements are so impressive and unique, making Oblivion a successful film in its own right. I'm glad to have watched Oblivion. My rating for Oblivion: 7.0/10",Oblivion
329,ivern-326-711636,My Dad Spoke with Tom Cruise During the Release of Top Gun! Just Sayin'!,7,16 April 2013,"Oblivion is about a post-apocalyptic world. The plot is that aliens attacked Earth, so the humans used nuclear weapons to defeat them, resulting in their world becoming mostly inhabitable. So the majority of humans have migrated to Titan, and the character played by Tom Cruise lives on Earth just to do his job on managing robot-thingies. It's a little bit hard to explain, but I'm telling you the set-up is really good.So while the set-up is good, the actual story just becomes too confusing and uninteresting towards the end. Morgan Freeman may be in it, but ... meh.The special effects are pretty damn nice to look at. At least most of the time. The futuristic machinery looks brilliant, but the less pretty stuff is ... well, less pretty.The score is also pretty good. It kind of reminded me of a related movie ... TRON Legacy! Which by the way is one of my favorite special effect movies.There isn't really a whole lot to talk about when it comes to Oblivion. It's really forgettable and there's nothing truly fantastic about it. The set-up and special effects are worth it if you're a huge sci-fi nerd like me, but the rest of the movie is ... pretty boring. It's not bad, in fact it's actually pretty enjoyable at times, it's just ... not anything special. Even if you're looking for just pure entertainment and action, I say the majority of movies this year with the same goal did it better.",Oblivion
330,cary_howe,A full of holes ego project,3,13 September 2021,"I have to say, didn;t it strike anyone as odd that somehow Cruise ended up BOTH being captured by the alien computer AND ended up in an escape pod? Also they never both to explain the pods suddenly crashing into the planet. FYI, they are never called escape pods they are supposed to be sleep chambers but you have to assume they are also escape pods as well. Them being on the ship and them crashing into Earth and everything that happens between is not explained. There's too many plot holes to list and the time frames in no way make sense. As a story it's a confused mess. Once and for all people clones are not the same person they are a twin, nothing more!!!!!! Scifi has always ignored the biology for the fantasy. Also, for the screenwriter, the alien computer would have been trying to get the deuterium which is only a tiny percentage of seawater. Not sure how you'd fit all the world's oceans inside a ship the size of city in the first place? Even the mass of deuterium would be larger than the ship. Sorry, science and commonsense ruin so many bad movies. Could it have been worse? Yes. Could it have been better, easily!",Oblivion
331,tmf084,not a masterpiece but decent entertainment,8,23 February 2014,"I'm not a big Cruise fan, because his pallet is limited and there are only a handful of movies where his persona actually works. Luckily this was one of them and I didn't really spend a lot of time to figure out how many pedestals they had to use every time I saw him in a shot next to a female character.Overall the movie is a bit too long and the first half could be condensed down. Not only to increase the pace but also to make the major twist a bit more surprising. As a viewer you got too much time on your hand to think about the movie and with some interest in sci-fi your first or second guess about the plot twist is probably the right one - however there are a few smaller surprises that keep you interested.What I especially liked though is the broad range of various scifi themes and topics they covered - nothing groundbreaking or original - but a decent blend. Probably because they really tried to clean up the plot of the most obvious holes. And while there were some compromises for dramatic effect (AI can't shoot straight in this one either) it didn't have the painfully obvious holes like Prometheus or Sunshine. Additionally the plot is very well structured, besides the multiple twists mentioned before they also found quite a good way to wrap up all the loose ends close to the end, which kept me interested.Overall impression: A fluffy FX loaded scifi movie which is good entertainment.",Oblivion
332,SnowLeopardMaster,Loved it,9,10 May 2018,"This movie is really good in almost every way. CGI and other effects make the whole thing look really beautiful. Tom Cruise is way underrated as an actor, and most of this movie's haters are just Tom Cruise haters. The musical scores were really cool as well, and the action scenes were thrilling and fun. But in fact suffers from the same flaw as Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. That problem is the plot. It's a big over complicated, and at times, poorly explained. The movie can be pretty confusing, but once you make sense of it, you realize just how creative and well done it is. The problem is figuring out what the plot is.",Oblivion
333,templar77099,"Starts slow, ends with thrill",5,25 July 2015,"""Oblivion"" is not, by any means, a sci-fi masterpiece, yet,and despite having its major plot twist (the scavs are the humans, not the invaders, therefore Earth lost the war and now Jack is just a clone working for the aliens)revealed by the trailers, it is still a fun and enigmatic film to watch. ""Oblivion"" is more of a love story than it is sci-fi. Although the world is post-apocalyptic, the movie focus on Jack Harper, played be the always competent Tom Cruise (I don't care what others might say, he is always good in every he is in), a character who is haunted by these memories of a woman whom he never met. He then realises he loves her and this love can jeopardize his entire mission on our planet. His team- partner is Victoria, played beautifully by Andrea Riseborough. Her performance was the one that really captivated me throughout the whole movie. The woman Jack is haunted by is Julia, played by Olga Kurylenko. I will not spoil her part in the movie, but, despite I kinda liked her, I think that her character wasn't too much explored. Another character that wasn 't well explored was Sgt.Sykes played by the talented Jaime Lannister, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. He is just a fine actor, he is really great and I would like to see him appear more on the silver screen in the next years. Morgan Freeman has the same part he has been playing for the last decade, a important person who enlightens the protagonist and helps him finding the truth. Plot aside, what really stroke me was the photography, special effects and scenery of the film. The way Joseph Kosinski directed the film is noteworthy, and I think that is a very talented director, still young (he is 41) and has a bright future ahead. He also wrote the graphic novel on which the film is based. The CGI is excellent and the scenery, specially the tower 49 (which was really built) are amazing!Despite starting a bit slow,""Oblivion"" is fun ride to a dystopic planet Earth, with a fairly good plot, good action scenes, and a strong cast.Give it a chance.",Oblivion

I did not like this movie.Tepid performances from everyone, including Mr. Cruise, coupled with a really insipid story and a pace that makes watching paint dry seem like a fireworks display happening above a street brawl made this an overly-long crapfest.

But after watching the movie for a second time and thinking about the film's story, i realised i really enjoyed the movie. The CGI in Oblivion is beautiful, the story intelligent and the acting is great. I enjoyed the twists and turns, i did not see the twist in the middle of the movie coming, but it was only obvious the second time watching the movie. Oblivion in my opinion was more enjoyable to watch than Elysium, although i enjoyed Elysium's villain more. Overall i think Oblivion is enjoyable but needs to be watched twice- at some points i felt the movie could drag on and i personally can't stand 'fading to black transitions'. Oblivion 8/10",Oblivion
338,AEBarschall,"Fun, clever, not too deep",8,23 April 2013,"This was a fun movie, with a bit of cleverness in the plotNow, if you did not previously know that Tom Cruise loves airplanes and motorcycles, this movie would surely tell you that. A very large part of the movie is devoted to filming Tom on aircraft and motorcycles. Andrea Riseborough achieves the odd effect of looking as if she is CG when she is real. I was absolutely persuaded that she was CG at one point, but now I don't think so.Tom also prefers younger women. You see that in this movie. The love interests are much younger than he.I think there is a danger when the performer has this much control over a movie for the thing to be too narrowly focused on what he personally enjoys. Nevertheless, it was a fun, peppy movie -- a lot of action, good photography, good special effects, all that stuff we expect from a contemporary Hollywood movie. It's not Shakespeare or anything, but that's not what it's for, not to be intellectual or overly thoughtful, just a diversion.I saw it in 2D. I'm not sure 3D was available, but that would be a good idea, given the number of scenes of aircraft going through complex spaces at high speed.",Oblivion
339,gelmcchristop,The return of the Clean,9,21 September 2021,"Ever since Space Odyssey and Alien, the clean, white futuristic look has been abused by cinematographers and producers, stuffed in sequences where it simply represents nothing. Oblivion is a great exception: black and white, clean and dirty are brilliantly mashed together, driving the emotional impact of the movie by generating an incredible sense of minimalism.The plot itself does have well-placed twists and is one of the most thought-provoking stories in the history of cinema. The abstract and mysterious writing however may confuse or cause the viewer's attention to be distracted by small details. It appears to be the top of the iceberg of an intricate lore, however understanding what is going on is clearly not the creators' intent: they want you to feel and think, and if you let them succeed Oblivion will become a cinematic life lesson.Finally the art and VFX teams deserve a hats-off too. The world and prop design follows the black-and-white scheme perfectly while always remaining grounded to reality, while the effects make for a visually stunning piece of video without going over-the-top with the surreal feel.",Oblivion

341,BharatSamra,Oblivion Indeed,3,11 April 2013,"oblivion (uh-bliv-ee-uh n) noun. 1. the condition or quality of being completely forgotten 2. the state of forgetting or of being obliviousThe only accolade that Oblivion may collect during its short tenure in the memory of cinema-going civilisation (other than a Razzie award) will be the honour for ironically living up to its title with sincere loyalty, even though I doubt that was the producers' intention. This truly is a forgettable film that is completely oblivious of where is wanted to go or what it wanted to be.Oblivion begins with a straightforward and vaguely interesting premise that does not necessarily offer anything new to the sci-fi genre but remains aesthetically magnificent enough for your engagement to remain trustworthy and hopeful that you will be entertained for the next two hours. However, the novelty of the excellent visual effects begins to subside as you come to the realisation that you hold no investment or inkling of care for the characters or narrative. All of one's dislikes of the film suddenly overtake any adoration that you could have had. It is a race between which feature of the film is most generic and reminiscent of other films. It really is difficult to determine a winner of this contest of conventions as there are so many racers clambering over one another, leaving the disappointed spectators unimpressed with the messy display.Oblivion manages not only to make its own theatrical experience less interesting with a weak plot, unconvincing acting and predictable twists, but it in fact reminds us of other cinematic indulgences that we have experienced in the past. Oblivion completely removes its audience from its futuristic setting and contradictorily displaces us back into 2012, 2009, 1999 and probably many other years that I am unaware of. It replicates elements of The Dark Knight Rises (through its score) as well as Total Recall, Moon and The Matrix via the plot. When you spend a large quantity of a film thinking about past films that are superior because the film you are watching tries to overtly be an amalgamated duplicate of these films, it certainly expresses the failure of that film as its presumed intentions to keep you engrossed have failed. If you thought the sentence before this one was quite a mouthful of literary mess, then just imagine that very sentence being adapted for a film and Oblivion is what you will conceive. Essentially, the objective for most feature films in my opinion will be to engage its audience to a state of complete escapism, but when watching Oblivion, one's mind manages to escape this escapism as you spend more time concerned with other films that Oblivion is trying to be, rather than Oblivion itself.The only unpredictable aspect of Oblivion is that the film concludes without a purpose. You are anticipating a dull and conventional climax that will leave you dissatisfied, but in fact something worse lurks at the finale of this unspectacular picture. Once the credits begin to scroll in and out of our vision, the usual cinematic reflection commences and your opinion of the film as a whole begins to emerge, and the only question I have for Oblivion is: What was the point? None of the events mattered, unexplained events are left scattered, and what for the first 20 minutes appeared to be a decent film, shattered into an abyss of dreadful storytelling.I do not wish be completely negative about Oblivion. To give the film credit, there were perhaps a few elements that made the film okay. Most notably the special effects truly are outstanding to the point that they completely convince you of their reality. The futuristic technology, while at times inconsistent, generally is the only feature that keeps you engaged, as to be fair to the film, there is not a moment of boredom to be had during Oblivion, though the levels of excitement negatively correlate with the 126 minute length of the film. Another component of the film that is good would be Tom Cruise's character Jack's attempts at preserving all that he holds dear about humanity as it once was. He desires to restore culture, customs and ideals that he knows existed before the fictional war that occurs before we enter the chronology of the film. Unfortunately though, they fail to enforce this philosophy enough for us to care about his character. Had this been made clear as the focal point in the film, our devotion and concern for the character may have been higher.Indeed Oblivion is a watchable film, though is just not all that enjoyable and there are honestly too many things to dislike about the film that weighing your likes and dislikes of the film is identically imbalanced with a lot of the film's scenes. Some scenes that are fairly unimportant are given a higher degree of emphasis than those that are actually concerned with the narrative, and often feel rushed just so they can get to the action sequences that follow. I am sure some will enjoy Oblivion, but I do not recommend anyone to waste their time with this film as you do not gain anything from being a spectator other than gaining insight that this is how not to tell a story.",Oblivion

It is beautifully made and the CGI doesn't affect or interfere with the flow of the movie.The cons are: The script is somewhat plagiarized from other films of this kind. In fact its the Sci-Fi equivalent of ' Hot Shots' or 'Scary Movie'. What I mean is, you see the influences of many film's in this one. Also, its a ninety minute film, not two and a half hours.Don't get me wrong, its a good film, some may even say its fantastic.

Ironically, Oblivion locks more like an artificial reality than Tron:Legacy does. The visuals are technically intriguing but nothing can help to camouflage the incredible amount of derivative moments: electronic score by M83 (almost sounds like Tron) and a lot of concepts and ideas from A Space Odyssey,Blade Runner, Avatar, the Matrix, Tron (of course...), etc.. Even Tom Cruise copies himself by wearing modeling jumpsuits and sunglasses, racing on bike, running like Tom Cruise, stiff and measured like in Collateral, etc. Oblivion is like a copy of copies of good ideas from others and Kosinski seems to believe that a different packaging makes a different product. The problem is, if you superglue so many different ideas without any narrative talent, the whole thing get's really dumb and boring because you do not really know what or who and what's all about. And that is quite surprising because the story should be very simple to tell considering how unoriginal it is. Déjà vu, confused by the movie, confused why a production with that budget couldn't find a better writer and director, confused why Kosinski got this job after he messed up the Tron franchise so badly... let's obliviate this one.",Oblivion
344,kxok630,Cruising around a bombed out Earth with Tom,4,25 October 2013,"All of the points are for the special effects. The set visuals and other effects were vivid and impressive. The rest of the production showed little thought or originality, with most of the cast and crew not showing up, nor even ""phoning it in."" It's a post-apocalyptic story, set in the year 2077, 60 years after an alien attack laid waste to the Earth, making it pretty much uninhabitable. The remnant population seeks refuge on Saturn's large moon Titan, and now sends some guy down to Earth to check on stuff as some kind of caretaker. Enter Tom Cruise as our hero. Remember how Wall-E endeavored to clean up an environmentally crippled Earth long after humans had taken to space? Well, the little robot Wall-E had a personality that was at once touching; not so with Cruise's character.There is never anything to care about in this character, or anything he does. First of all, Cruise never fills the role. He looks out of place; dressed like he's going to a high school prom while he wanders around a destroyed landscape. Cruise's acting consists of some bland stares at what surrounds him, and a romance with a woman that has as much chemistry as inert lead. The scripting doesn't help the lousy acting; the story really never pulls you in. The characters don't do much of anything, and blunder their way into some plot-devices rehashed from scores of other movies. There are revelations about things, but by this time you may be asleep.Before closing, it's fair to note that Morgan Friedman makes his usually fine effort in the movie. But even he can't save it from the other actors.In short, it's an effort at sci-fi that burns up in the atmosphere of its own laziness. If you like watching Cruise wander around with a confused look on his face, you might like this. But don't expect a story that's worth telling.",Oblivion

The alien supercomputer has just two people that it lies to get a job done. So who built the fancy condo that Cruise lives in? Who makes all the stuff that they use? The food? The medical devices? The portable bike? If the supercomputer makes all this stuff, why not just make some kind of drone repairman out of its own repertoire? Next, why suck all the hydrogen out of Earth? Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. There's plenty on nearby Jupiter that would be trivial to extract. Or even a nebula. Or just collect solar wind.Aside from the superfluous need for the drone repairman and Earth water, let's consider the predictable plot. Earth wins. Yeah! The ending feels good, but hollow calories. Of course we know something is fishy from the beginning of the film based upon the secrecy. After all, what are they hiding that they need their memory wiped? This plot of turning Earthians against their own kind has been explored already in the The Outer Limits. We know he's not going to really take his wife to die.

348,andre_rox99,Confused World....,5,13 April 2013,"OBLIVION is a sci-fi/thriller directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman.The movie revolves around Jack Harper (played by Tom Cruise) who is living with his colleague, Victoria. They are working under 'Tech Drone Maintenance'. The moon was attacked by a bunch of aliens, which caused the Earth to become vulnerable to tsunamis and earthquakes. After all the destruction, there was a war between the aliens and the humans. The humans won but due to the mass destruction to Earth, they were forced to vacate Earth and live on another Saturn-like planet called Titan. Jack and Victoria were the last people on Earth. Everything was pretty routine until Jack finds a survivor, who looks similar to this girl in his dreams. And then he is captured by a resistance group leader (played by Morgan Freeman), who forces him to realize that he has been living on lies... and that forms the rest of the movieSo when I first saw the trailer of this movie, I wasn't sure if it would be that grand, but when I saw Trailer #2, it totally changed my whole perspective of the film and I decided to watch it anyways. I went for the Friday late night show and just wanted to see a movie where the Earth looked different, with an amazing plot and Tom Cruise firing robot-looking aliens everywhere. When the movie started it had quite a boring tune... and as the film progressed it kind of went the same way as the beginning. There wasn't much action, in fact there were only 2 or 3 action scenes in the whole movie. At the end of the movie I didn't even understand what was going on. I just sat inside the cinema, waiting for my mind to indulge in some kind of action. When I exited the cinema, I went home and went on Wikipedia and just read the whole story to understand what was going on.There were some parts which got me pretty hooked but other than that the movie is just a visual-effects fest. The writers were trying to go for a finesse story but I don't think they did a good job executing it well.The only person who I felt did a really good job was Tom Cruise. I felt he played his emotions really well and his acting was quite good. The person who was SO underused was Morgan Freeman. He had NO role whatsoever. And whatever role he DID have, he was there in the movie for like 20 minutes... out of a 135 minute film.If you are going for this movie just for the visual effects, I highly recommend watching this movie in IMAX. If you are going for this movie for action, don't see it. If you are going for Tom Cruise, MAYBE you will like this movie.But overall, I feel this movie just robs you of your ticket money.

MOST OF THE MOVIE VIEWERS ARE NOT AS STUPID AS YOU ARE! Do not get confused by all those 10-star reviews. Most of them are done by paid ""reviewers"". This movie is wrong tactically. Every tactical aspect is wrong and stupid. STUPID. Should I even attempt to mention the tactical flaws? a) No camouflage is used by the main character. He can be seen from miles away. b) Why the concept of helmets is lost so completely? The main character does not wear a helmet even when he rides a dirt bike (a white dirt bike). c) A huge, long WHITE-colored rifle will get in one's way most of the time. Did anyone notice any spare mags? d) What is the story with the rifle-mounted flash light? Don't they have any NVGs or light-amplifying sights? No camouflage + bright flashlights? Do they want to be detected by anyone from miles away? e) The main character is constantly exposed, because he ridiculously works alone. There is no one to spot for the guy who does repairs and therefore cannot watch his 6 o'clock. He acts as though he is alone on the entire planet, although he is so obviously not alone. f) No body armor?! Why? The main character is evidently challenged by various opposing forces, but he has no ballistic protection (see the part b about the absence of helmets). g) If, or rather, when that flimsy flying machine brakes, the main character will be stuck in the middle of radioactive no where. I would not take this job. e) Since the flying machine is not a helicopter, then why does it have a large tail with a fan? A tail rotor is only used on single-rotor helicopters. The flyer in the movie is a heavily thrust-vectoring machine with two engines. So, the tail with a fan becomes utterly useless, obviously. Also, whatever kind of concepts they employ are WAY OVERUSED! Crushed Moon, crumbling Earth, robots getting out of control, clones, Earth invasion, ruined Manhattan, etc. Whiskey, Tango, Fox is wrong with you, Hollywood? You people keep releasing piles of the same nonsense again and again and again! Also, all this sentimental BS is tiring. Just to make the movie appeal to love-starved house-wives, the producers had to add tons of boring ""feely"" sentimentality and unappealing ""romance"". I do not even feel like reviewing such pile of garbage. No, I did not finish watching this movie. I got sick of all the silly nonsense. Thank you, Hollywood.

Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) and Jack (Tom Cruise) as ""colleagues"" but I felt a bit disappointed by the not so strong as expected Beech (Morgan Freeman).",Oblivion
354,richcarter1962,Another Dud from Cruise,4,27 July 2013,"I love good SciFi movies, unfortunately this movie does not belong to that group. I will give you the one thing that was good about this movie. The visuals were stunning. If you don't care about plot and just want to see something pretty, then by all means see this movie.The plot is paper thin. They rip-off just about everything in this movie from some other SciFi's. I would love to see Tom get back to what he did well, a sort of devil may care guy, think Risky Business. Once again his character here seems to be soulless and made from cardboard. The 2 women weren't much better. For me, I didn't care about any of these characters; maybe the writers/director didn't want us to, if that is the case they succeeded famously.If you are a SciFi aficionado, of Ray Bradbury and his sort story telling then you will probably like his movie, if your taste in SciFi leans towards Star Trek then don't see this movie you will not like it.",Oblivion

356,utpal_das,"Just like Tron Legacy, all gloss, no show",2,12 April 2013,"There are a few actors whose movies most people definitely like to watch, the so called box office stars. Tom Cruise is one of them, I like to watch which ever movie he stars and I liked his last 2 ventures, Day & Knight and Jack Reacher, his movies entertain. This didn't. All the movie has was gloss and lots of it, it was a visual spectacle and thats about it. The screenplay was bad, story/ plot is confusing, the actors are very very wooden, even the ever reliable Morgan Freeman was wooden. Cruise was alright. Overall story is that the main actors along with some very powerful drones take care of what remains of earth after a huge battle with 'Scavengers' or that is what the main actors think until the truth is revealed. A lot of the movie depends on the director as we all know and I guess a director has a bigger influence than the star. Christopher Nolan can probably make a star out of anybody. Here, the director was more in charge. The guy had previously made the hi quality 3D movie 'Tron Legacy'. I say high quality because the animation was mind blowing, but the movie was as bad as it can get. Oblivion was not as bad as Tron, but if Cruise was not there, even the mind blowing visuals couldn't have saved the film, not that Cruise can. IMAX effect is good. If there are no other movies in the theater and you just landed there, you might watch it, but don't make an effort to go out there just for the movie. The last 2 consecutive big budget movies turned out as damp squibs (G.I Joe and this) and hope Ironman 3 is better although the trailer doesn't look that promising",Oblivion

Some twists can be guessed, but the movie was well acted, and it's actually a great acting effort by Cruise... not as good as Reacher (which I feel came out at the same time) but decent.The design kind of looks ripped from Mass Effect or the Star Wars Prequels, but overall it was nicely done. Great shots of the desolate landscape in the spirit of Fallout 3.I feel that Freeman was underused and the team he leads were mindlessly erased from plot progression; they're so careful for years and end up as nameless body counts.

For what? To where are pieces which neither this man nor his accomplice gets to know. Amidst the daily repairs and routine clean up, he scraps through what was not suppose to be his area! The truth is beyond the review and is something which you should watch the movie for.

A fiction story that contains a mystery itself generally. It had also a mystery on the characters which you don't find it in a lot of movies .Then the humans who survived and try to destroy their enemies and the alien invasion was a lie and trying to get Jack on the good side an incredible performance by Morgan Freeman .Also the end was magnificent when Jack destroys Sally and in the earth life goes on with his wife who has a young daughter and tech 52 returns home .

Oblivion is a sci-fi movie with amazing CGI and great performances. The story is well delivered to the spectators and there are moments in this movie that will make your jaws to drop.The performance of Tom Cruise as Jack is outstanding and Morgan Freeman as a supporting character did a great job. I loved Andrea Riseborough's performance and i enjoyed Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau playing something else except Jaime Lannister. I never admired Olga Kurylenko as an actor and it is my firm belief that i never will, but to be honest with you she did a great job too.As i said the CGI was great and the music selected for ""Oblivion"" was marvelous.

The film provides wave after wave of revelation that had me scratching my head at one point wondering how deep all of it would go. Fairly deep as it turned out. The minimal cast all acquit themselves well. Tom Cruise as Jack Harper carries the film with ease with good support from Andrea Riseborough as the sad and confused Victoria, and also the gorgeous Olga Kurylenko.Special effects were not overplayed, they didn't need to be, but there were some great scenes of the ruined Earth, ie the harbour of ships that is now a desert and the bombed Pentagon, etc etc.Last year's Prometheus should have been like this, and not the mindless rubbish it was, I wish more films had as much care and thought put into the storyline as Oblivion.Try and see this film before it expires at the cinema, you won't regret it.",Oblivion
363,alexdelliott,enjoyable but disappointing,5,14 April 2013,"I know giving a film a 5/10 is the worst possible move as it automatically earns everyone's hate seeing as the general consensus on IMDb is to give a film a 1 or a 10 with very little scores in between. But I'm going to say that I did find this film enjoyable and thoroughly watchable, but disappointing as it could've been much more.I love the world that was created, and the tranquil scenes of Earth juxtaposed the gritty action nicely. The acting was solid all round especially from Tom Cruise who gets much more hate than he deserves, he is still one of the best actors around.So why only give this film an average score? Well, it made some rather disappointing rookie mistakes. Firstly, there were so many holes in the story. I know it's sci-fi and one must suspend their disbelief, but some of the mistakes were just sloppy. I won't elaborate for fear of spoilers but when the story finally does kick off, don't try to think about any of it too hard. This is my major issue with the film.Also, whilst Cruise's character was well developed, the others (such as Morgan Freeman) were left pretty undeveloped and hence one-dimensional. Freeman pretty much acts as the plot explainer and many of the other characters I simply did not care about as they were given virtually no screen time.If you like sci-fi action then get some popcorn and watch it for some solid entertainment with friends but don't try too hard to think it through. I left the cinema feeling disappointed at a film which was entertaining but could have been much more.",Oblivion

There are many ways to describe Oblivion, but the softly spoken afterword by Tom Cruise's character really makes you feel the human heartbeat of this sci-fi epic. As always, the trailer is full of explosions and set pieces. Oblivion the movie is an entirely different beast that values a human story and characters that are driven by common purpose. While the cast is tiny, I found much to enjoy from Cruise, Riseborough, Freeman and that Nordic guy from Headhunters who is showing up more frequently in Hollywood blockbusters. Aside from unusually limited screen-time, Morgan and other supporting cast are effective and memorable. The threads of the plot are well-woven and I won't give anything away, so what I will tell you is to prepare for a powerful journey into the unknown where nothing is what it seems. Explosive set pieces take a backseat for sci-fi philosophy with twists to spare. Oblivion ticks all the boxes for correct use of literary devices and establishes enough original cannon to stick in your mind long after the credits start rolling. It is a distinct success among the largely abysmal offerings of 2013 so far, don't miss it.",Oblivion

366,drakula2005,"Engaging From the First Moment to The Very Last, But Blink-and You'll Miss It !",10,20 April 2013,"Every passionate moviegoer (as myself) has a certain annual wish-list of films, he/she is willing to do everything to see ASAP.And as a sci-fi fan, it has from some time been a foregone conclusion that Oblivion stands at the very top of my 2013 must-see-at- all-cost list, right up there with Elysium and Riddick among others.So the time finally came and in the time of writing this review, this nutbag moviegoer has seen the film twice.Because, love it, or hate it-you must admit, that blink-and you've missed it.Shut down for a moment-and you've missed it.And that's what's so fascinating about this experience.For those of you, who know Joseph Kosinski-i don't need to tell you, that he's already proved (Tron:Legacy), that he is unparalleled in his vision and style.As if he was born to do sci-fi of the highest order.And even if you wanted, dear reader, you actually cannot look any further than Tron, because there's literally nothing to look at.He is indeed new, but that doesn't seem to be bothering him nor his impeccable vision.The screen writing is also strong, contrary to critics believes.I found the collaborating between so many people in that department rather useful.In most examples, when one has a few writers or directors, the end product becomes rather divided and visibly shaken and chaotic at moments.But the story with Oblivion is very different and unique in it's own way, thus making it all the more special for us.So, with such an elite team penning the script, Oblivion grabs you in it's clutches and doesn't let go until the very end, when all the questions you had during the build-up, are either left open for you to decide what to believe in, or unfold logically, without ruining the whole mystery and mesmerizing enigma and integrity of the film, thus making it an experience, the first must-see Experience of the year to date.And with such a talented group of people at the helms, the only thing missing is an equally strong cast.And, boy oh boy, didn't we get one (that's right, Olga Kurylenko, i'm talking about you).As a person, who's seen the film twice, i consider myself lucky to have been able to focus solely on the actors and their expressions and emotions throughout the second view of the film, so soon after the firs one (it's all still fresh in mind this way).And it's fitting to begin the examination of the actors and the human factor from the man in the front, Mr. 100 million dollar man Tom Cruise.I personally dislike the guy, because of the lack of emotions on screen and the wild personal life off it.But let's focus on the screen-in films such as all ""MissionImpossible""'s, i just can't feel any emotions in Cruise, i understand he must be coldblooded and decisive as Hunt, but even the affection he should have been allegedly feeling towards his loved one, just wasn't there.In his more recent Jack Reacher, it's the same.Rosamund Pike is reaching out, but he's not responding.But here, he's oddly terrific-he even manages to break a tear or two in a few moments.He feels more human, than he does in the films he actually portrays one.But here, although just a number (roughly said, he's more than that), he has all the emotional mojo going on for him.Andrea Riseborough' Victoria is a little bit colder than needed, but given her looks, i assume that was the idea all along-a precise, even perfect (on the outside), yet cold woman-a perfect description for a flawed, non- functional ""human"" being. As one of my most beloved actresses, Olga Kurylenko's fallen angel, Julia, on the other hand, is Vicka's complete opposite.She's warm, full-blooded, a human being in every sense, and Jack's heart rightfully belongs to her, even when she is nothing more but a distant memory, a dream that comes at night.Even with his memory erased, he still sees her as his love, his life in a past world, not yet plagued by destruction.All that time he has been waiting upon her return in his life.She is even willing to sacrifice herself for the sake of all rebellious people left on earth, in order to preserve a little bit of that world she knows still exists in the heart of the still living humans led by Morgan Freeman and ass-kicker Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, and, of course, Jack.Both she and Jack understand the meaning and the consequence of an eventual sacrifice, because they both know and with her help, they both remember and see, that really ""Earth is a memory worth fighting for"".Aside from the strong tagline, which comes to great aid of the film, and a very accurate one as well, the Cruise/Kurylenko pair is a marvelous one, and after seeing her portray Julia the way she did, i no longer feel sadness over Jessica Chastain's (another muse of mine) drop from the film early on.That's how awesome and human Kurylenko was.Just look at her mesmerizing and beautiful eyes, they express a waterfall of emotions throughout.The just say it all...And that piece of Paradise Jack has found and made for them at the meadow by the lake, is the most deserving and fitting finale for the two, although there's always a sour note that one must digest.But i won't spoil it for you.But in the end(linger with me just a little more), Oblivion answers most of the questions it raised, and leaves others intentionally wide open.But the human aspect of it, will remain in my mind as the strongest quality this film possess.And the sheer brilliance in the visionary aspect of it.A fitting finale (the last heartbreaking & in the same time-heartwarming scene in particular) to a fitting summer 2013 opener and my number one so far this year as well!A deserved 10/10 for Kurylenko, Cruise, Kosinski & co. for the masterful job on Oblivion!",Oblivion
367,danren121,Interesting,7,17 November 2013,"OK. A giant upside down pyramid decides to pool earth's resources together for its survival, and uses the clones of a couple of astronauts it kidnapped in outer space to run the daily chores of world domination, whilst convincing these astronauts they're acting in their own interests by concocting a story involving scavs and a eventual refuge in a place called Titan. (Naughty pyramid.)(Titan was a moon the astronauts were originally investing, ahh..)The opening hour of the film is well directed and engaging. Its only when a space craft carrying the sleeping passengers of the original mission (Investigating Titan) is intercepted by Cruise that the lid on his past is lifted. (But intercepted originally by the scavs who are really humans who want to defeat Tet.) He ultimately discovers he is a clone but the memories he retains enable a relationship with his wife (who was on the original mission too but got cut loose upon being detected by Tet - where the pyramid lives.)Trying to keep hold of a wriggling fish feels an apt analogy for the plot. The opening premise is quite promising, there is a day in the life of a star trooper feel as the daily maintenance of North America is carried out. The survivors are an honest bunch, but come under attack by three drones when they open the doors. What they survive on is perhaps not addressed, so we have to assume its snow and baked beans. Morgan Freeman sort of gets his wish to see ""the look on its face"" when the bomb detonates but his emergence from the capsule surely must have been tempered with a little disappointment when he finds himself facing a huge inanimate triangle.",Oblivion

However, the simple and thoroughly unoriginal story is told in a long-winded, very slow manner and the acting is rather bland. The majority of the landscape we see in ""Oblivion"" is in Iceland (and it's worth seeing in its cragged, somber beauty), so if you recognize it, it might be irritating that it is supposed to represent devastated New York. Technically it's an impressive work. The footage of Icelandic landscape with its natural gorges is blended seamlessly into CGI ruins and cityscape crevasses, and the clean, smooth ""2001""-ish structures of the repairmen's bases are a feast for the eyes. But as the technical merits of ""Oblivion"" alone can't create a satisfying cinema experience, we're left with another pretty standard, slightly dull though good-looking sci-fi action flick.",Oblivion

The plot might be a bit confusing in the beginning so I suggest you do a few rewinds on your DVD if you prefer to understand every aspect of the story.

If you're as tired of that unrealistic premise as I am, you might take a little extra pleasure from this creatively twisted scifi adventure.Our hero describes himself as part of a mopup crew in a post-alien invaded, devastated Earth being readied for final evacuation. Our first clue that something's amiss comes when he also tells us that he received a ""mem wipe"" to accomplish his mission of maintaining the machinery that is packing up Earth's water for a trip to humanity's new home on Titan. He and his female partner, in every sense of the word, are due to leave for good in only a few weeks when he picks up on a few other clues that start to jog his repressed memories. Is he really a hero, or is he being manipulated? I loved the imagery of this movie. Iceland's barren and bizarre terrain is as awe-inspiring as any alien world might be. The machines themselves are also beautiful, graceful and clean, much like the futuristic flying EVE robot in WALL-E, only fierce.

In fact, at some scenes, i thought i was sitting in Inception! So, some of the flaws include: Morgan Freeman's character. This is the first (and hopefully last) time i will say this... Morgan Freeman was not right for this role, even though he did a good job.Plot holes.Too many silence scenes; no enough action scenes.and finally, illogical scenes and bad editing.Overall, this was a slightly too long movie that tried to be more than it was, with a mainstream story line, but very visually stunning cinematography.HandHStudios Rating:5/10",Oblivion

Unlike Tron Legacy (his first work on big screen) that barely supplies depth and contrast, Oblivion delivers a wealth of ideas and their successful realization.Downsides: Part of Gonzalez and Trapanese soundtrack, Tech49 sounds like Nolan's Batman so much that I get distracted, come on guys a little more creativity won't hurt anybody. Pieces and parts taken from other movies are sometimes too obvious to be considered as sources of inspiration. The 5 minute introduction isn't really necessary since Jack and Vica will explain all to Julia again during the movie.This movie could give birth for a prequel and sequels, it's beauty and storyline call for more Tets and love stories to unfold...Definitely worth watching, buying and contributing to Kosinski's career.

374,manusanchez90,Top scifi movie! 9,9,18 April 2013,"Before reviewing the movie ""Oblivion"", I announce that I am a huge fan of action and science-fiction movies, specially those set in the future, like ""Total recall"", ""Paycheck"", the ""Star wars"" saga movies, etc. Also, I am Tom Cruise's number one fan. So, when I heard of ""Oblivion"", I knew I would enjoy it. When I saw the trailer, I knew I would love it, but when I saw the movie at a cinema, I was very positively amazed. I cannot explain much about the plot because it is very original and is the ""nitty-gritty"" of the movie. The visuals are great. The devastated planet Earth, the ships, the battles, the action, the buildings, etc. are very well designed and the ships reminded me of the ones from the Star Wars saga movies. This movie gets inspiration from many others of the same kind. It is good to know that the script is original, I mean, it is not based on any movie, book, comic, video game, etc. Even though there is a lot of CGI, some visuals are more crafted than in most scifi current films. It is clear that the director Joseph Kosinsky has done an excellent job (better than ""Tron: legacy"", and I do not think this is bad at all). Kosinsky is a very young and promising director. He was able to combine intense action scenes with mystery and drama in one movie with a very fluid pace that makes you pay attention for every minute the movie lasts (it lasts a bit less than 120 mins.). Tom Cruise is great, one of the best actors of all. Moreover, he seems comfortable in the action scifi genre because ""Minority report"" and ""The war of the worlds"" are other excellent films starred by him. Anyway, they are not as good as ""Oblivion"" for me. Among the cast, we can also find Morgan Freeman (not his best role, but very good as always), Olga Kurylenko (a very active and believable actress), Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (famous for acting in the series ""Game of thrones"", gaining importance in the industry and with a correct performance) and Andrea Riseborough (she is not still well-known, but she played an incredibly believable and dramatic role). In conclusion, the best things of the movie are the pace, the ships, the ships battle, the fight between Jack Harper and a clone of his, the plot's originality and, of course, Tom. The worse thing is that some detail can be a little predictable. ""Oblivion"" is a must-watch-movie for those who like scifi films and who admire Tom Cruise, too, like I do. 9.",Oblivion

377,generationfilm,Oblivion- A Science-Fiction Hodgepodge of Borrowed Ideas that Finds Strength in Visual Atmosphere and Confident Acting,6,19 April 2013,"Science-fiction in film used to be the genre for exploring unfamiliar terrain relating not only to imaginative worlds but also in expanding our moral and contemplative horizons relating to the human experience. However, it seems science-fiction has become a comfortable excuse for only inventing visually captivating sets and technologies for repetitive action sequences instead of utilizing new worlds to widen our gaze into conceptual territory that has relation to our modern existence. This typical laziness can be witnessed in director Joseph Kosinski's sophomore film Oblivion which focuses on creating the architecture of the world rather than worry about the purpose of the structure and substitutes original storytelling for a hodgepodge of stolen plot devices from better executed and more intelligent science-fiction films from the past. Kosinski is known for his resurrection of Disney's groundbreaking cult film Tron with his stunningly visual yet overly stimulated sequel Tron: Legacy and though he repeats his aptitude for captivating visuals they are still inundated by a lack of original foresight by screenwriters Karl Gajdusek, Michael Arndt, and Kosinski himself. Leave it to a renowned commercial director to transform contemplative highbrow science-fiction narrative elements from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Duncan Jones' Moon, and Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker into mere George Lucas inspired mindless space opera. Though Oblivion might be an inferior clone of familiar territory there are some entertaining qualities not only in the visual atmosphere but also in its admirably confident first half before it loses grip on its own unnecessarily convoluted reveals of influences. As an action film Oblivion suffers from its longwinded pauses and as an intriguing science-fiction film it suffers from an overstated sense of self just creating a newer model that we've all seen before. Kosinski does indeed prove that he can entice our imaginations with a lavish immersion into a full dystopian reality but doesn't have the compelling storytelling capabilities to match his visual inventiveness.Read more on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-xI Other reviews: Generationfilm.net",Oblivion

But I was more bothered by the woman's role in this movie. She was just there to love the hero and that love helped him to remember. It's like in this old action movies where the super buffed up very manly heroes have a (of course very beautiful, soft and loving) woman on their side so we can see their weak side and we know for what they are fighting. Until the very end I didn't understand what that woman was good for. She was a pilot, she was no damsel in distress, so why make her appear so weak? I'm really surprised that nobody seems to be bothered by this. We have so many movies out there where woman are potrayed much stronger and braver than man (which is ridiculous and unrealistic) and then we have such movies where they reduce a woman to her role as a caring and loving wife - who somehow got pregnant at the end of the movie and I don't know when that happened! I would prefer something in the middle: an interesting, strong woman who is no superwoman at the same time. Well, that said, the sci fi part was spectacular, I loved the scenery, the cinematography, the pace, the mood, the mystery. I was not bored for one second and that means something when a movie has a run time of two hours. I think 8 stars are well deserved considered how much I enjoyed the movie, even though the ending wasn't the most inventive.",Oblivion
381,FrostyChud,What does a woman want?,8,14 April 2013,"I think I would be a great director. An exercise I love to engage in after seeing movies like Oblivion is to imagine the sequel, only this time told from the point of view of everyday life. I think that Oblivion 2 could be a hit. The central conflict of the film would be that Jack Harper 2 is still beating himself up over the fact that he lost the fight to Jack Harper 1...Jack Harper 1 dug deep and found his human soul, whereas Jack Harper 2 just watched the Tet blow up from Earth like a shmo. How humiliating...Jack got his butt kicked by himself. In the three years it took JH2 to find Olga Kurylenko, he's turned bitter and in fact misses flying his mosquito and skinny dipping in the sweet pool in the clouds with Vika...screw subsistence living, eating berries, and hanging with a bunch of grungy resistance fighters. As for Olga, she misses the ""real"" Jack...never stops reminding Jack 2 he's not up to the standard of Jack 1...disgusted with his cowardice, she begins cheating on Jack 2 with the hunky Sykes character. Sykes turns out to be an absolute dog and after she catches him sleeping with every other woman from the underground tribe she loses it completely and runs away from the idyllic cabin in the hopes of finding a better Jack Harper. The little girl finds a turtle in the pond and adopts it as her pet...a cute detail. Etc. This is how they would film such a movie in France...of course, the price of this emotional verisimilitude would be the epic scope and philosophical tone that make these movies an American specialty. As for Oblivion 1...I liked it. I go for these epic, super sincere science fiction stories. This one is similar to all of the other ones...there aren't that many twist possibilities out there and there's no shame in adding one more variation to the basic theme. Apocalypse...cloning...the official truth versus the real truth...redemption through love...sure, we've seen it before, but we've seen everything before. These science fiction movies are a conversation that we as a society are having with ourselves...playing out in the collective unconscious all of our fantasies about the present of humanity. Of course they're going to resemble each other...they have to if they want to say anything about our world. One important theme here is feminine desire. What does a woman want? The question that famously stumped Freud is front and center here. A million Jack Harpers and only one Julia...the idea is intriguing. And couldn't the whole premise be considered Vika's fantasy? Is not the Tet a big V? Vika is attractive in a prosaic English way...whereas Olga is a Continental fox and femme fatale who completely blows her modest domestic charms out of the water. And who is the culprit? Vika's overweight, insecure mother, of course, whose only advice to the young Vika was something like: the way to seduce a man is by making a good shepherd's pie. Have you ever been to England? It's not a very sexy place...here in France I regularly see bands of chubby young English girls on vacation who clearly look shell shocked by how much sexier and more comfortable with Eros their French counterparts are. This brings us to Sally: who is Sally if not the castrating mother figure whose meddling prevents Vika from becoming the kind of independent, sexy woman that Julia is? Vika's inability to sever the tie with Mother turns out to be the source of the raging force that destroys Earth...beware of a woman's desire...",Oblivion
382,dioditto,Visually stunning with some flaws,7,14 August 2013,"Visually speaking, this movie is truly quite stunning, and understandably so. The director Joseph Kosinski is an alum of Columbia University's architecture program, and the film's stunning set piece ""Sky Tower"" was heavily influenced by Mies van der Rohe's ""Barcelona Pavilion"" with a touch of high-tech surrealism thrown in. The beautiful bubble glass swimming pool is something that can only exist in the far distant future or architect's wet dream.Plot wise, the movie was quite predicable. You can almost guess right off the bat that Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough's characters works for the alien invaders - the technological advance shown in their sky tower is simply too fantastic to be fathomable. Another crucial clue was the ""triangular"" badge that they were wearing (the logo was everywhere) - that was a tip off right off the bat too since it reminds people of the ""Tripod"" from ""War of the Worlds"". Not to mention the supposed space station was named ""Tet"" - the very name that etched in American psychic as the greatest defeat of modern American army by their enemy (Tet Offensive).In many ways, the plot is very similar to the film ""Moon"" (2009), but with alien invasion plot twist thrown in. There isn't much depth to the movie, and it ends before you know it. Which is a good thing because you really don't want to think too hard about it or all the faulty plot holes will start to emerge and you will regret paying to see this movie.7/10",Oblivion
383,skanklover_69,Cruise control,5,1 December 2020,"This is Tom Cruise's movie. Everyone else is a supporting character with little dialogue. Tom Cruise loves riding motor bikes in real life and in the movie there are multiple scenes of him doing that, when using the heli-plane would be a more efficient way of searching. He's the savior of the world with two beautiful women vying for his affections. He flashes his trademark, ""hey, I can't help if the babes dig me"" smile. He's the all American hero, a maverick who plays by his own rules, like he has in most of his films. It's undiluted Cruise. This movie steals shots and stunts from well known sci fi movies and even from his own like the Mission Impossible's. It's pacing is slow, but it has slick production values. The twists at the end are ridiculous. An army of Cruises. That's the icing on the cake. If you still love Tom Cruise then you might like it. Otherwise just let this movie fade into oblivion....",Oblivion

The story is somewhat predictable, and the acting by the supporting cast is not up to the mark. But Cruise manages to hold his own, and tries to carry the floundering script through. There are some annoying plot holes, like how did the guerrillas know about Julia, and how could an intelligent being like the Tet not fathom Jack's intentions, or that he had a nuke in his ship. If enough attention had been paid to the script, this could have been one of the best space movies. Freeman is visible in only a few scenes, and I feel he could have been used better to lift the story. The romantic moments between Cruise and the supporting cast do not really enthrall. It is at best somewhere between a romantic drama and a sci-fi mystery, not quite capturing either end very well.Overall, an average movie with stellar cinematography and a cruising Cruise.",Oblivion

388,jeffrey-utley,The Hardest Movie To Follow Ever. But It's Still Really Good.,8,7 July 2013,"Tom Cruise has been called crazy and proved that he is crazy many, many times. It has been said that he is only good in one role: playing a guy with a gun that has a big situation. Sometimes it has been said that he is just flat out a bad actor. He proved to me in 'Oblivion' that either he's a good actor, or he's good at playing the role of a guy with a gun who has a big situation. This movie is very hard to follow, but good. It was enjoyable to me and kept me confused for a very long time. It's not an extremely complicated movie, like 'Inception', but you can't really figure out things in it. This movie almost completely pulled that off. With amazing scenery and very cool action, this movie very much deserves the rating I gave it.It starts out with Tom Cruise narrating what's happened, what he's doing, and why he is where he is. I didn't like that it was Tom Cruise narrating, because I think that when in the beginning of a movie, to tell what has previously happened, they rely on characters narrating it. I think that it's cheap and if they want to tell us what's happened then they should just show us. Anyway, there's no figuring out what he does, because he just told you, so when he does it, it's kind of boring. That's one thing I wanted to talk about. The beginning, where they should have introduced the characters, they did a little bit, but mostly had boring things happen that no one cared about. I know that this is one of those movies where you figure out that the main characters were lied to and it needs to start out with them having no clue that they were lied to, but if you're going to do that, at least make it interesting and entertaining. This part is why I said the movie almost completely pulls the ""hard to follow"" type of movie off.Later, there's action that's actually pretty entertaining. A few weird things happen that didn't make sense for the characters, which started pulling me into the story. I started liking the movie at that part. Some kind of confusing things happen, and you don't think they need to happen, but later you figure out why they happened. The story then is interesting and better than before. There's a little more character buildup, and there are some things that you can tell aren't quite right. I thought that it was a good idea to do that at this point, because it really made want to know what it was that was wrong, and what's going on.Then, all kinds of weird things start happening and the movie gets better, but I had no idea what was going on and that it was extremely hard to follow. When I can't really figuring out what's going on in a movie, I think that the writing for it is good because of that, but sometimes I think that if you don't know what's going on, it could be bad, because it could have failed trying to give that information to you.Anyway, it was exciting, but my mind was filled, so I kind of had no idea what to think. In this section of the movie the Morgan Freeman part that was in the trailer came, and I didn't really like that part. It kind of happened too fast and didn't really give off much information. It may have tried to give us more information, but it failed to, but I don't know. There was also something else wrong with it that I can't quite put my finger on.Well, after that it starts getting even more complicated and I got completely lost in that part. Before it got even more complicated, it gave us a little information (that part was boring, though), and it explained a little bit of what had happened and what came up next, but I will still completely lost next. I had no idea what to think of the movie at all then. It wasn't boring, because I was confused, but I thought this movie needed to redeem itself, because I didn't really enjoy being lost, then. The things that happened in this section were clever, but very strange, and of course, complicated. Later, it is redeemed for, though.Now it really starts getting good. A lot of the questions are answered and we're set strait on a lot of things. I really started enjoying the movie there. This wasn't exactly the end, but it was leading up to it. Their explanations were very smart in the writing, and are acted very well. There weren't many big things that happened in that part, but I don't really think you can have big events happening what you're trying to explain why all of these crazy things have been happening in a movie, but I think it would be cool to see a movie pull that off, though. So, now we have most of the answers, but not all. The end is coming up, and we're ready to figure everything out!The end of 'Oblivion' is here now, and it is amazing. It starts by huge action buildup, then to a very sudden but completely awesome and intense action sequence that blew my mind. This scene was the main reason this movie got an 8/10. It kept me on the edge of my seat with hardcore action, then emotional scenes, then back to more hardcore action. This movie completely pulled off that scene. Later comes the resolution, and the answers to the rest of the questions, some of them with flashbacks, which I thought were shown nicely. My 8/10 rating means that the movie was really good, and I will want to own it.",Oblivion
389,cosmonadz,Sci Fi conundrum,8,23 April 2013,Oblivion is set in the not too distant future and the story unfolds with small flash backs and present time story telling. After a war with an alien race the earth is left in ruins. The start of the film concentrates on 2 central characters but as the story goes along more are added. It had a certain 'Book of Eli' feeling but quickly gathers pace with its plot. I enjoyed the visuals and the story wasn't too weak although it did lack spark mid way through in my opinion the love/emotional storyline does distract from the premiss. Saying this it still flowed along nicely and as it begins to get complex you don't lose yourself in the middle trying to figure out who is what and when!! The end could have been better but so could the end of a lot of good films. You won't be left disappointed as a sci fi fan it touched on all of the things I like best. I would've loved a more detailed history of the alien race but then I guess time can be your worst enemy when trying to cram it all into 2hrs and 10mins. I would suggest IMAX or a larger screen for an optimal viewing experience. Tom Cruise does what he does best and mixes up the action with a touch of romance of plenty of heart. Oscars I doubt it but a worthy performance never the less. Lets hope this is the start of a run of some enjoyable sci fi films set to hit the big screen this summer.,Oblivion
390,agore3,OK movie,5,6 November 2016,"It was an OK movie and not a total waste of time. Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise so did not see any real new dimensions from him. It had a very slick look but the plot was lacking with a lot of plot holes and it ran a bit long. It started fine but when he had the moments in the stadium and then ended up in shangri-lai on supposedly waste land I felt the movie was not going well. Now, who would put a power core for a drone up front (they just snap in with gum) and it was so easy to disable. They were awful shots so there goes credibility. After meeting the scabs, it started getting predictable and as others as said the mother ship could not tell who the second person was or that they carried weapons. Of course the flight recorder that he happen to have filled in most of the story points. For the conclusion, the other tech finds the shangri-la and they live happily ever after.It just looked like an expensive pretty picture with a weak story although I liked it better than some other recent ones.

392,Aldri7,"some good, some bad",6,13 May 2013,"""Oblivion"" is one of those movies thats hard to review without writing a spoiler. I'll have to be careful...OK, lots of people have written reviews here complaining about how this movie is a rip off of so many other Sci-Fi movies like 2001: a Space Odyssey, Tron, The Matrix, Blade Runner, Wall-E, Independence Day, etc. So maybe thats the bad news. But the good news is that all of those movies were good movies, so at least here you can count on Oblivion NOT being trashy like the Alien series, etc. I mean thankfully, we have Tom Cruise, and playing a role too in which he must confront and understand his own existence almost like Bruce Willis had to do in ""The Sixth Sense"". So you will be forced to think a little bit, but it shouldn't take Sci-Fi veterans that long to get the catch. We've been down this road too many times now.Anyway, Tom plays Jack Harper, a technician entrusted with maintaining power generating equipment and drones on a post apocalyptic earth. Who he actually works for is for you to figure out. Who Jack Harper really is is also for you to figure out, as well as for Jack, who is not really all there mentally. Now, IF Jack can remember whats been wiped from his memory, and many are counting on him being able to do that, he may be able to save earth from the aliens that wrestled control of it from humanity. There is still time, but only if a secret plot intended to bring him to his senses works. Thats the story, anyway. OK, but is this enough to carry the film? Its a very lonely place where Jack works unfortunately, and we must first suffer through a pretty dull opening 45 minutes before anything really interesting happens. Here he is paired up with a beautiful assistant (Andrea Riseborough) but with virtually NO other support structure which is bizarre. So of course they make love. There seems little else to do and no one is watching anyway. But I found all of this boring and tedious. Meanwhile Jack stalks the planet like a Swat team member. Looking for what? Scavs? What are they doing there? Slowly, a plot does begin to unfold, though, and soon nothing is as you thought it was in the beginning. Meanwhile, we've got some nice but not earth shattering cinematography to enjoy, an atrocious music score to listen to, and not a whole lot in the way of dialogue from anybody thats not military-talk. Yawn........Oh, and there are these drones with those blinking red eye-lights. Eventually though, the minimalistic plot a la 2001: a Space Odyssey turns existential when a spaceship with mysterious cargo crashes and we get to scratch our heads a lot. Meanwhile, I like the flashbacks to NY and the ""oasis"" which was green, but inexplicably so given the seeming absence of any other life on the planet. I kinda don't have a clue as to how the shack and all that memorabilia got there, so it was almost like a dream. Maybe it was. Maybe it wasn't real at all, but a state of mind, like an eden. Jack visits the shack early on like a man returning to his childhood. Without his memories, though, what draws him there? Some strange attraction he will eventually come to understand, I guess, and a garden of eden and rebirth it will prove to be ultimately. So, but thats about all I can reveal though, and you will have to see the movie to find out what really happens. I can tell you though that Jack does fall in love, or re-falls in love, which reacquaints him with his human side. Its a love kind of like in ""Avatar"" - a dual ""love of woman/love of nature"" kind of love. And of course, from there, just like in Avatar, we go right to the battle which climaxes the movie.So yeah, its a rehash - I admit it. Avatar mixed with 2001: A Space Odyssey mixed with Independence Day mixed with Wall-E, etc. I'm glad that we never got to meet any real aliens though, which turned out to be one of the interesting little twists in the story. But overall, all of that thought provoking mystery surrounding Jack and his love and his past doesn't quite make up for the fact that so much of this movie is predictable visually, musically, and technologically. Morgan Freeman gives us his usual nice performance, but otherwise, we don't get much insight into the folks that he leads. Their plight? Their pain? Not really revealed, unfortunately. And lastly, ANY movie who's main character's name is ""Jack"" is going to dredge up memories of Titanic for me and WILL YOU PLEASE STOP REPEATING THAT NAME and calling it out over and over again! JACK!........JACK!........Call him Clarence and maybe you won't feel so compelled to cry out.Thank you....",Oblivion

396,KrazzyDJ,The visuals are surely not prone to Oblivion,7,14 April 2013,"In a vast seemingly endless landscape, Jak travels on a bike surrounded by what appears to be the remnants of the Manhattan Bridge. In another shot, Jak's Bubbleship circles a destroyed football stadium which hosted the last Superbowl before the alien invasion that destroyed earth. These are simply two of the many shots that you see in Oblivion showing a ravaged Earth circa 2077. And they're a sight to behold no matter the countless times such sights have been and shall continue to be shown on celluloid. The effects blend in seamlessly and after the initial few shots, it ceases to matter what's real and what's digital.For a futuristic sci-fi that claims to be original (and it is if Kosinski's unpublished graphic novel by the same name is considered just that: unpublished), Kosinski nails the look and atmosphere. But then, Kosinski's already done that in Tron: Legacy, his last outing, which was no less of a visual achievement by any means. Fortunately, at least for me, this one comes out to be a tad bit better than his previous attempt.Jak Harper and Victora a.k.a. Vika work as a team with Vika serving as the operator and Jak handling the drone maintenance work on Earth: repairing drones that have been programmed to destroy any alien life on sight. Earth was destroyed in an alien attack 60 years ago and while the humans won the war, the planet was sabotaged beyond habitation. On one of his routine missions, Jak encounters a flying object that crash lands on Earth. It turns out that there were five objects housing humans with one of them resembling a woman Jak has been seeing frequently in his dreams. Jak rescues her and the real story takes off from there.Joseph Kosinski takes the simple route and has the film begin with a narration by Cruise explained the aforementioned scenario. Perhaps he chose to do it because the film already has plenty of surprises in store in the second half and as such, there was no need to obscure Earth's current situation. As expected, the movie feels like a well polished product in all departments. Cruise, Olga and Andrea turn in pretty decent performances despite having no distinct character arcs to follow. Cruise in particular gives in a very, shall I say, sincere performance playing it low key. Freeman essays his cameo with ease. The Zimmerish music does get a bit repetitive and generic but manages to keep the tension at appropriate levels which suits my tastes so that'll be a plus for me. And thankfully, the movie refuses to go all out into Haloesque action mode for a long time with the action being interspersed and well spaced and most importantly, kept to as much as is required and no more.What you will take in the end with Oblivion are the visuals. Lets face it, by the time the whole movie ends, you'll realize all the plots elements have been borrowed from a flick or two in the past. But these days, its not only about an original plot but an original execution. And for a movie that's not a remake, or a sequel, or an established comic book or adapted novel, Oblivion does the job. It may not be an Avatar but Oblivion is decent enough for a one time watch. And going by the visuals, that watch is best suited for the big screen.Score: 7.5 / 10",Oblivion

To start off, I'm doing a recent Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion. This movie is set in the future. The moon has exploded and Jack Reacher and his partner, who I forgot the name of, have to repair these drones for some organization. But weird things happen, yeah, it's kind of hard to explain. Okay, now onto the review. The story itself is pretty good. It brings us an interesting plot that is pretty thought provoking. But, it's really confusing! All these weird things happen and the movie doesn't do a great job explaining the situation, leaving some obvious plot holes. It's one of those movies where you have to see a lot of sci-fi movies to truly get. The acting is pretty good. It's nothing phenomenal, but it's still pretty good. The characters themselves are bland an uninspired. The only truly likable characters are Jack Reacher and Morgan Freeman (because, you know, he's Morgan Freeman). All the other characters are completely one dimensional. The character developments and relationships aren't much better. They're pretty weak and not well explained. I want to know what happened in the past, not just small snippets. I want to know what got the characters in this state. It doesn't do good explaining. The action scenes are pretty cool. They're flashy gun battles that really keep you on the edge of your seat, but they're interrupted by really, slow, boring, uninteresting character developments. At least the movie did justice at the end, which wrapped up the movie in a great way. The dialogue is, for the most part, pretty good. There are some lines that come off cheesy and pointless. It's a small complaint, but it is noticeable. Overall, the movie was decent. It had a good plot and sweet action only to be interrupted by weak character developments and confusing plot twists. The movie is still enjoyable, but it's not what it could've been. If you want to see it, rent it. It's not good enough for a buy.",Oblivion

401,portsea,"As entertainment, brilliant....",9,13 April 2013,"I went to see this having read a few reviews, I also heard a review from a friend that Richard Wilkins on Australian critic had said it wasn't that good. Well, I have no idea what film they saw, but it wasn't the one I saw. The start was a little slow, but still threw in some moments of concern to keep one on the edge. As the film settled on, it kept moving at a good pace. Story was a basic love story, mixed in with morality, but basically, love story. Cgi was amazing, cinematography was brilliant, stunning even. All the main characters were easy on the eye too, always making it easier to want to watch. Plot wasn't sophisticated, probably described as feel good, but frankly, it was perfect. I left a 2 hour film and wasn't bored for a second. Cruise, for all the press on him and his supposed kookiness, I don't care, he carried the film..... GO SEE THIS, pure entertainment.",Oblivion
402,BoredNow33,Amazing from Start to Finish,10,24 July 2020,"Everything about this movie is perfection! To begin with, the story is fantastic. Twists and turns and a surprise ending. The characters are likeable and interesting. You root for them. You want the best outcome for them. The story is completely unique, not a rehashed storyline you have seen 4 times over.Tom Cruise is simply enjoyable to watch when it is just him on the screen for so many scenes. Olga Kurylenko is beautiful and such a wonderful actress. She shines in every scene she is in.The cinematography is visually stunning! Watch this movie in 4K, it is like you are there. Everything looks so real and beautiful, even on this desolate planet. It makes your heart hurt for the damage our world has sustained in this movie.Joseph Kosinski learned a wonderful lesson from Tron. Let one artist do the whole soundtrack. M83 is a phenomenal artist. The soundtrack he created is more brilliant than what multiple artists could have ever put together. This is one of the most magnificent soundtracks of all time. It is emotional, exhilarating, moving, and so much more. I could watch the whole movie with just listening to the score.",Oblivion
403,connorwburnett,A Film Overshadowed by its Own Soundtrack,6,8 February 2021,"I've got a strange relationship with Oblivion. I have watched it at least 5 times so I know it quite well. Its the sort of film I always get excited to re watch again but each time I do so it becomes less entertaining and more underwhelming. I'm not sure what keeps bringing me back to this film - perhaps its the score. I listen to it quite often and it is probably Oblivion's best feature which tells you everything you need to know about the quality of the rest of the film.Lets start with the positives (this shouldn't take too long). Overall, the action was handled well. Straying away from fast cut action was a breath of fresh air and the use of the sequence shots tracking the drones was quite appealing to the eye.To put it simply, Oblivion is a nice looking film. The cinematography is of a higher quality to most action films however it left nothing to analyse and was quite hollow - the shots looked good just to look good - nothing was conveyed.How about the negatives? Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko were pretty awful. Cruise is just playing your average action hero - his only noticeable character trait is that he wants to escape the conflict and lead a simpler, more natural life. Other than that he was just an exposition dumper and driver for the plot. Olga put on a terrible performance that made me question if she was just hired for her looks, she brought nothing to her role and was just reliant on Tom Cruise's character the whole film. This has got to be the only film featuring Morgan Freeman that I forget features Morgan Freeman. His performance isn't bad but the script is. He had nothing to work with, if you can get Morgan Freeman in your film give him something useful to do - what a waste.The film begins with a massive exposition dump from Tom Cruise describing what happened to the world and their jobs in restoring what's left. The thing that irritates me about this is the fact that they literally recite this exposition all over again after Cruise rescues Olga's character. So what was the point? You just wasted the first few minutes of your film. This does seem like the sort of thing added in post because the studios thought that the audience would be too stupid to understand the film's rather simple premise.I was displeased by the antagonist. The drones were the face of the enemy and they got very repetitive over time. The reveal of the villain just being a big floating pyramid was uninspired and bland.So is this film worth watching? I'm struggling to answer this question because I wouldn't call this a bad film. I would say if you really enjoy Sci - Fi action Oblivion will be great fun for you. If you're looking for anything more complex I can't say you'll be too impressed. Looking at it, 6/10 does seem rather generous. But when I think of Oblivion I think 6/10. Nothing more, nothing less.",Oblivion

Guess it's all Iron Man and Trek, bad timing, people saving up for these two movies, well, see them, and go see this.It takes it's time to get where has to go, which is fine, Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough is lovely here, and is quite excellent with Olga Kurylenko who is the opposite, a very emotional character, Morgan Freeman must of had quite a bit of fun here, and looks way cool, it builds up to the final reveal in the last acts of the film.A simple film in a way, and at least it's not ruined by 3D crap.

Zzzzzzzzz.,3,15 September 2013,"Sci-fi is my favorite genre, so when I read the description of this movie on Redbox, I was excited to try this out, despite getting negative reviews from my in-laws. I should have heeded their advice. I watched about 40 minutes of the movie and called it quits, and even that took a lot of effort. To me, it is quite similar to Steven Soderbergh's remake of Solaris, the only movie I've ever walked out on. It is visually stunning, incredibly slow, and going nowhere even slower. It has a lot of dream sequences, which I personally find annoying. It also lacks any clear plot or direction, though I confess I wasn't paying close attention after the first few minutes, so I probably missed something relevant in that regard. I'm just grateful I only wasted $1.20 renting it at the Redbox instead of paying $9.00 to see it at the theater.",Oblivion

But it's just Total Recall meets Mad Max meets Waterworld meets Independence Day (and I am sure there are other ""meets"" that can be found - heck I might even have found a reference to The English Patient at one point too).Olga Kurylenko is painfully short as an actress of any quality, so is just there for looks. The only actresses of any quality are Andrea Riseborough and Melissa Leo, neither of which given enough to show off their talents further.The pace of the film starts out very engaging, with the customary slow parts in between, to ensure it's not too relentless, but then it gets even slower further into the movie and I was starting to get fidgety.The actual reveal is not really that revealing - you didn't go ""oh I seeeeeeee"", you just went ""Oh right OK"". So a lot of build up to nothing really.And of course it is cliché ridden - just once if a child falls in mass stampede, could the heroine just keep running? And why is it sleeping together once is always absolutely certain to result in a baby? All in all, not sure why Tom signed up for it. Joseph Kosinski (Director) hasn't exactly got a good track record and this matches it.",Oblivion
407,warrenf_peace,Very Good (I LIKED Tron: Legacy) - Maybe a Spoiler,8,19 April 2013,"Tom Cruise is very likable, even in a stinker film, of which he has few, and this was in no way a stinker. It had a slower pace than roller coaster rides like an 'Armageddon' (in that way, like Tron: Legacy), but it held my interest and kept me engaged. Yes, there was some predictability's, but some surprises, too! And how can you not like his female counterparts.. yes, Tom always gets the girls (in that way, I'd like to see him fall down once in awhile in the movies instead of his personal life), but you can't have everything... that is, unless you are Tom Cruise... ha! I'm jealous.I agree the CGI is GREAT! And the Story, once it got past the setup, was very good - not GREAT, but I'd give it a 7.5 (I give it an 8 overall - Production Design was first-rate, like Tron).The music, well, not so great. Tom's acting gets better most of the time, and he's great as a 'come-from-behind' hero. Again, you just can't help but root for this guy. If you like Sci-Fi, Definitely Go See it!!!",Oblivion

Based very closely on masterpieces of the genre such as the legendary ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick or the unforgettable ""The Truman Show"" by Peter Weir, including the famous ""The War of the Worlds"" written by HG Wells, Kosinski signs, in a ravaged land, a visually impressive film, carried by a physical and charismatic Tom Cruise, all in complexity and mystery!On the actress side, Olga Kurylenko brings a pretty feminine touch to the whole, unlike the enigmatic Andrea Riseborough who chills pour blood! The special effects are at the top and the sound, the 5.1 is as immersive as without excess, reserving beautiful effects for a soundtrack with appreciable dynamics. If you let yourself be gripped by this cinema and its very refined style, Oblivion may stick to your skin for a long time! And this even if I didn't always understand everything about the plot with some inconsistencies in its finale, but really promising in the first part.

This novel this movie is based on must have been written using an alternate time line. The movie's war supposedly started in 2017. We're nowhere near this space time line.

410,devileye03,Oblivion - Unique sci-fi movie with a unique title. Deserves a watch! (NO Spoilers!),8,17 April 2013,"Tom Cruise is one of my favourite actors. And he collaborating with Joseph Kosinski for OBLIVION makes it even more exciting as I was extremely impressed with Joseph's debut directorial- 'Tron Legacy' which I missed watching on the big screen. So I had to watch OBLIVION in a theatre for sure.I won't write any spoilers because otherwise it won't be a must watch film. Oblivion is a sci-fi fantasy with full on suspense, thrills and the sci-fi part is just the vessel carrying the story with an emotional core that has a beautiful connect to the audience. It gives out a loud message that no matter how hard we try to be like practical machines in the modern era, we are still only humans with feelings.The cast is small but effective. Tom Cruise as Jack Harper is as usual a brilliant protagonist and gives the film a replay value. But its my personal wish to see him for a change in a complete drama, romance or a historical epic again. (like Vanilla Sky, Jerry Maguire and The Last Samurai). Andrea Riseborough gives some steamy scenes with Tom, specially the unique swimming pool scene is to look out for, which is aesthetically shot. I found her performance far better than Olga Kurylenko (the ex Bond girl). Morgan Freeman in his brief role is memorable.The cinematography & VFX shots are spectacular. Reminds me a bit of 'Prometheus' which is good in a way and adds to the realism of the plot. The 'shattered moon' shown in the sky is a brilliantly creative example of the visual effects.The story is quite unique though I wish the duration could have been decreased and the climax could have been more interesting than it is. Some amazing futuristic gadgets are shown in the movie like Jack's ship and his cool bike which are visually appealing on the big screen.I can't forget to praise the amazing sound and background music. Tron Legacy's soundtrack is already a hit and Joseph Kosinski made sure this was no less. He as a director has shown excellence again and Oblivion is entertaining enough to question that this was his second movie only! Really impressive.Oblivion is a good movie, a commendable attempt for bringing an air of freshness in sci-fi genre, even though it falls short to be a masterpiece. Must watch experience.",Oblivion

412,maveric1974,"Great story, amazing visuals, but not the polished article",6,27 August 2013,"I really wanted to like this. An intelligent story that despite the sic-fi setting would be welcomed by even non-fans of the genre. The production design and the visuals, particularly on the wide, landscape shots are just breath-taking and the future Earth is also well-depicted. Cinematography by Claudio Miranda was just gorgeous (had to look up afterwards who shot it, it was that good)! Alas, the final product felt a bit cold and empty for me and despite really wanting to like it, I wasn't as emotionally drawn to it as I would have liked. The issues for me stemmed from the choice of actors.Tom Cruise was really good, but I felt I was watching Tom Cruise, the star, not the actor who has worked on projects before where you believed the character was doing all the stuff, not Tom Cruise, the star e.g.. Tropic Thunder, Magnolia, Jerry Maguire etc. As much as I wanted to believe his role and his character, it left me slightly cold. When you are not invested in your central character all the way, that becomes a huge problem. Olga Kurylenko was an absolute waste for me. Not for a second did I believe that if that was me, I would be ready to give up my life for her! Her character was well-written, she was gorgeous and had that vulnerability about her, but her acting chops let her down big time. Andrea Riseborough, take a bow. Probably the strongest performance for me. In her small screen time, you totally invested in her character and her motivations. An absolute revelation and I would love to see more of her in future projects.Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau could have been combined into the one single character and that would have been much better. Didn't really see the point of two separate characters for these two.Overall, a great story. Could have been something special e.g.. Gattaca, Moon etc. but unfortunately not quite for me. Kudos to Kosinski and Tom Cruise for giving it a go. Great to see a refreshingly different take on the sic-fi genre. This, despite its flaws, is still worthy of 2 hours of your time.",Oblivion

What is amusing to visualize just as in the movie 2001: A Space odyssey, if we watched this 64 years later, how we would react to the past idea of the future, its a fun thought. I believe there could be other actors more suited for the main role, as i felt Tom was just going through the lines without anything out of the ordinary, blank. On the other hand Andrea Riseborugh (Victoria) really did upstage Tom, clearly she had a better understanding about her characters emotions and delivered a credible performance. If the story was as spectacular as the design we'd have a terrific movie.",Oblivion
414,thetruth45,Good but a borderline copy of an indie movie from 2009,6,28 April 2013,"**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SERIOUS SPOILERS- Be Warned** So, if you haven't seen the movie Moon, then Oblivion is an 8 because it's a cool idea- a guy is being cloned and used to work in industry...ultimately finding out he's a clone and his life and the job that he's doing are not what they appeared to be, and so he rebels against those using him as a clone. So....I hate to break it to you guys, but this MOVIE WAS DONE, and it was done better on a smaller budget only 4 years ago. Go rent Moon. Sure this movie changes some stuff around to make it ""original"" but the general concept is basically an identical steal (i.e. cloned worker finding out he's a clone, his work is BS, and rebelling against the higher power).Other than that there are a few miner gripes: lack of character development for earth colony, lack of explanation for why this alien organization/colony is doing this to the earth, and some of the story lines are completely far fetched and don't make any sense...for example, Tom Cruise's character ejects his fellow astronauts from an ejection hatch in his space ship before he's captured and cloned.....one of those he ejected was his wife....So 60 years later Tom Cruise's clone finds his wife in a time capsule that just entered the earth's atmosphere? HUH?!?!? What a frigging coincidence, and it took 60 years for an ejection pod to make it from a space ship to the earth? Something is off.Other than the inconsistencies in the movie, lack of story explanation, and totally plot stealing, the movie is interesting and kept me entertained. I would have liked this a lot more if I didn't predict and know everything that was going to happen before it happened simply because it was a plot line RIP JOB. If you are going to rip/steal a plot this closely at least WAIT like 20 years to flip stuff around and make it seem original. Don't do it from a movie only 4 years ago!!!! Come on.",Oblivion

There are deserted landscapes, beautiful futuristic buildings and drones and spaceships of an advanced technology. The direction isn't special apart from some crazy zooms. It's obvious that the director has seen 2001: A Space Oddyssey more than once.Tom Cruise delivers a very solid performance, although he doesn't do a whole lot more than being Tom Cruise. The catchy one-liners that he utters are cringe-worthy though. The plot takes some unexpected turns that you wouldn't expect from a Tom Cruise feature.

416,brillmongo,"Glossy packaging, but it's all dumb inside",1,26 July 2013,"The setup is simple enough, bad dudes blew up the moon and so we nuked them all. The loss of the moon's stabilising effect on the earth combined with all the nuclear fallout meant humanity sought refuge elsewhere. But we're still using the earth to suck up all the deuterium from the seas for fusion energy and to protect these installations we got a bunch of heavily armed autonomous drones that kill any ""scavs"" they find.It all looks sorta pretty but the problems in this film quickly build up and compound on each other to the point where very quickly not a goddamn thing makes any sense.Apparently 64 years from now humanity has access to fusion energy so I suppose getting the last few survivors to Titan isn't too big of a problem but mining Saturn's hydrogen atmosphere for deuterium is out of the question? And we totally can't deal with the radiation but our main character who works on the surface and gets dust blown into his face doesn't need ANY form of protection other than the clothes he wears? Also earthquakes were too much of a bother but a -180°c mean temperature is not?Oh and the high risk job of drone maintenance that requires our hero mechanic to be armed with not just a side-arm but an honest to goodness assault rifle, that can totally be done by just one guy, right? Better not give him a couple mates that can at least keep a look out so his bike doesn't get stolen, that'd be boring.Did I mention by the way that our protagonist has a bobble head doll that's got sentimental value to him? No? Well now I have and I'm happy I shared that with you because little details like that are very important to bring to your attention because otherwise how else would you understand Tom Cruise is a human who likes motorcycles and football and has height issues?This film is just plain badly written.

I thought I was going to see more, and in some ways I did, but, in some I did not. The settings in this movie were phenomenal, and it had better acting then I expected. It really hit heart in the ending. But, I honestly thought this movie was to slow, WAY to long, a little boring, and 100% confusing. Toward the end I started to take guesses at when it was going to end. Their was always a perfect spot to end the movie, but instead, they add on 15 more ongoing minutes that waisted my time. The ending definitely could've been better, although it was very deep. It was just how the plot worked and how everything was just all over the place you just lost focus and were not able to pay attention. As much as I want to say I loved it, or even liked it, all I can say is it's okay.Oblivion is a fresh new idea that you may like for sci-fi fans (although I am one) and do encourage you to see this movie.",Oblivion

After discovering a crashed spaceship the contents changes everything that Jack believed about the famous war and even himself.This film was an odd one for me it wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing ether. This film had some very strong elements to it. The cinematography is just outstandingly beautiful. I love a good landscape shot! The camera work on the smaller things like Jack fixing the drones was interesting too and really well done. The acting was of good quality across the rather small cast. Tom Cruise was excellent I felt he was a lot better in his more recent films like Edge of Tomorrow which I loved but he didn't do a bad job and think he gets a lot of unnecessary hate for his personal life/opinions and people put down his superb acting skills because of it. Morgan Freeman is a guest star too and dose a satisfactory job this is one of them Morgan Freeman roles that if I'm being honest anyone could play but after years of acting in some of the most famous films ever *cough* Shawshank Redemption *cough* he's earned the right to take it easy on acting front. The storyline is where it gets rather odd for me looking back after seeing it last night it was a rather simple story but watching it unfold I kept wondering how the whole story put together which was both a hindrance, of not 100% getting what was going on a lot of the time, and a help in the fact its not all ABC, dull, predictable, crud. The script was not notably good but it wasn't notably bad my favourite line was the end one ('F*** you Sally') I just did not expect him to swear maybe more of that when he was in danger and things to add to the realism of the whole scenario would of upped it a bit. On reflection this film was quite good and did the simple things to a very high standard, the cinematography in particular was outstanding, in hindsight the story is simple and interesting, think this will be worth a re-watch in the future.",Oblivion
421,joehemmings68,A Pretty Little Distraction.,7,11 January 2015,"The first thing I noticed about Oblivion was how absolutely stunning it looked. Whether it will hold up in years to come, as I've found CGI rarely does, remains to be seen. For now, everything looks gorgeous, which is impressive considering this post apocalyptic earth is a wreck. What the plot does well is a very slow build at the beginning. Hints are thrown in that something is amiss, but you aren't given enough information to know exactly what. It's classic suspense building and I thought it was very effective. I thought later plot developments were very reminiscent of Moon , but I didn't think this was a bad thing, it was done quite well. I thought by the final third you had a clear view of what was going on so some of the intrigue was lost, the big fight scene was fun, but I could have done without it. The ending on the whole was a bit flat, which was a shame. I have to compliment Cruise, which I don't do all that often. I thought he was excellent, and surprisingly subtle. It isn't a huge cast, but he was absolutely to star of the show here, so props.All in all, this is fun. In terms of it's ideas, it isn't wholly original, but it's nice to have an original science fiction film as opposed to a sequel. I've said it's a distraction because that's what this is. It's quite thrilling but not edge of your seat, it's quite entertaining but not riotous fun, it can be emotional but sometimes falls flat. Putting aside the aesthetics this doesn't truly excel in any way. With that said, if I'd have gone to see this at the cinema, I'd have been well chuffed because it's far above average for a blockbuster.Seven out of Ten.",Oblivion

Intelligent, exciting, properly large- scale spectacular and ultimately thoughtful, and rather heartbreaking.Cruise is magnificent, Riseborough is magnetic and enigmatic, and Morgan Freeman's brief screen time stays just the right side of Hollywood cliché. The M83 score is beautiful .. and in the final twenty minutes, OBLIVION does exactly what you want it to do - it goes big. Very big.

They get into the acting and the cinematography and the personal and professional lives of Tom Cruise, and a whole bunch of other stuff---not including what the movie is actually about.Some of the critics even claim there is not much of a story. They are flat wrong and I am going to have to say why.*** Serious Spoiler Alert *** The point of the movie is that there was a war between Humanity and space aliens. In the beginning, we are told and we believe that, yes, Humanity won that war but at terrible cost.As the movie develops, we start to sense a growing doubt. Did Humanity really win that war or did the aliens win it? The answer gets less and less clear as the movie develops.My initial reaction to ""Oblivion"" was much like everybody else's: I thought it was a slick nothing. But, as I thought about the central theme of the movie---who really won the war?---and put it into our own modern context, I realized the brilliance of it.Everybody seems to think that the West in general and the U.S. in particular won the Cold War. Many people, including scholars, have pronounced the death of socialism and the triumph of capitalism. Of course, that is just what I thought, as well. And yet, today we have a socialist president in the White House, we are getting socialized medicine, and my own city (New York) just elected a Sandinista-style Marxist as mayor.At this point, it is fair to ask: Who really won the Cold War?

Tom Cruise typically has done very well as the hero in sci-fi films, and this film is no exception.In fact, it may be a cut above Minority Report, Vanilla Sky and War of the Worlds. The storyline is strong with a few unique twists to it that keeps it fresh and interesting. The special effects are good and so is the supporting cast. Morgan Freeman plays Beecher, the leader of the ""Scavs"", and Andrea Risenborough along with Olga Kurylenko are the women in his life.

These assumptions turned out to be very wrong, as Cruise's latest movie is actually an aesthetically pleasing, well-crafted, and well written drama that will engage you completely.Oblivion opens with a brief introduction into the world 60 years in the future. Earth has been ravaged by nuclear war, alien invaders have destroyed the moon, and a large group of human survivors are planning an emergency evacuation to Titan, one of Saturn's larger and more hospitable moons. The visual effects here are absolutely stunning; even without 3D, I was truly blown away by how crisp and beautiful the massive landscapes were in this film. Also of note here is the score, which really breathes life into the desolate remains of Earth. It's difficult to talk about much more in this film without giving anything away. The plot has a few interesting twists and turns, the characters are all acted well-enough (Cruise is particularly good), and the last few minutes of the film are magic. I imagine that the reason I enjoyed this film is because I had no expectations. I would definitely recommend this film, but go in with an open-mind and try not to rip apart the story for whatever plot-holes it may or may not have. Also, this movie is NOT an action movie. It's a long, slow moving drama that is well worth your time if you're in the right mood. Overall, it's good, just good. RATING: 7/10",Oblivion
427,imperator-ming,Better than it needs to be,10,12 September 2020,"I'm not gonna lie, I'm a sucker for good movie plots, and so for this movie, I'm basing my rating entirely on that.To me, the plot of Oblivion feels like it was written by someone who deeply explored every character involved, what they are doing, and why. Not everything of that is said out loud, a lot of it is hidden between the lines. That makes rewatching the movie, or just reminiscing about it, especially worthwile.When I write my own stories, I always try to live up to that.",Oblivion
428,bmerrett,Could Be Much Better,4,20 December 2013,If you have ever watched a sci-fi picture in the past 30 years you will recognize most the the clichés in this nag. The canyon chase scene was directly from the Death Star in Star Wars. When was that made???? 70's? The red lights on the drones were from Hal 2001 a Space Odyssey as was the name of the craft they were in. There were enough holes in the script that you could pilot a craft through them. And lets not talk about how terribly slow this picture moved. If we had to watch another New York flashback to hit us over the head with the relationship between Jack and Julia i was going to scream. Tom Cruise is a big enough name to be able to choose his vehicles but he did not choose wisely this time. Give this a miss.,Oblivion
429,Classics-Movie-Fan,Thought provoking sci-fi drama/mystery,8,12 April 2013,"Just saw it in London, England as its on general release here now. Overall its a very decent movie. If you expect a slow moving sci-fi drama set in the not too distant future (2077) then this is that movie. Its by design a slow moving but interesting premise & feels a lot like a 1970's sci-fi classic. Not quite though as the reveals leave you wanting a little more exposition but for the running time it covers pretty much everything anyway.As long as you do not expect anything more than a bleak & thought provoking sci-fi drama you will not be disappointed the visuals of a barren & almost destroyed earth are flawless. Acting is solid across the board & Tom Cruise gives a measured performance avoiding any opportunity to smile or make humour of the dire situation they are in.Andrea & Olga have about the same screen time as Tom overall as the joint female leads but the chemistry between Tom & Andrea & Tom & Olga is just fine.For once you have a modern film which does not fully reveal its ending until the last 2-3 mins up until then you have no idea how its going to end which is a strong example of just how skilled a director Joseph Kosinski is as for me personally I did not notice the 2 hour running time at all as I was so enthralled in what was happening on screen & how it was all going to resolve itself (or not as this does not give you many answers & leaves several questions).8/10 from me.",Oblivion
430,ClintWardley1,"At last, a thinking mans science fiction.",10,28 April 2013,"I was going to wait for this movie to go to DVD (That is what I did for Looper). But my father who is 78 went to see it and called me and said I should see it straight away. My Dad has 2 movies he marks all Sci-Fi against, Alien and Blade Runner. To my surprise he said that he now has 3, Oblivon. I was in shock, my father is a very harsh critic and he is not a Tom Cruise fan at all. He doesn't like Super Hero movies and he thought Joss Whedon's Serenity was OK and Star Wars, he thinks is silly.So off I went with the wife to see Oblivion and he was right. Now, I don't mind Tom Cruise, but really in a lot of movies he plays the same type of character and in Oblivion, his Jack could have been Nathan Algren (Last Samurai) or John Anderton(Minority Report) etc. But in reality that is who Jack was. The questioning main character who doesn't just accept things as they are, he questions.Joseph Kosinski, the director was impressive, the actors especially Andrea Riseborough, were near perfect and the script? Get the Sci-Fi channel writers to watch this to see how it is done right. No cookie cutter plot here. A real science fiction plot, not sci-fi but science fiction, up there with Forbidden Planet and 2001.Why some people give the movie a low rating is beyond me. But after reading the Hated It section I believe that there is no pleasing some people.What more can I say other than see it fast before the office buffoon or some TV critic gives away the great plot.",Oblivion
431,AlanJ2,"Excellent and affecting science fiction, unusually sophisticated for high budget blockbuster",8,14 April 2013,"Excellent fusion of romance and sf, slightly over-length but utterly engrossing and beautifully filmed by 'Life of Pi' cinematographer Claudio Miranda, very affecting performances. A few clichés enter film in second half but overall it's a sophisticated mix of sf and action as most of the serious US critics recognised. It is difficult to discuss this film without spoilers but it combines a number of sf themes and ideas in a way that is extremely satisfying. Elements of 'Solaris', 'La Jetee', 'Moon' and much more. So great to see a big blockbuster as intelligent as this. It's like a consolidation of themes and ideas from the past decades of science fiction.",Oblivion
432,Lackluster-Me,Isn't as bad as everyone says it is,8,26 June 2021,"I really enjoy this movie. It's movie is very complex and I recommend seeing it again. It has a lot of great ideas and has interesting characters I'm invested in. The story is set in the far future. It has been evacuated and abandoned due to an alien invasion by creators named ""scavs"". A drone-repair man named Jack and partner Vika are the last sent there to clean up. Both of them have memories, though only Jack's are seen and in his dream there is a woman who is always there. He has no idea who she is and it's driving him mad. Then bang! A ship crashes on Earth and guess who's on it? The woman of his dreams, literally! For content: one F word at the end, Vika and Jack go skinny-dipping, the noises the drones make are pretty frightening, some gun violence. PG-13 stuff, pretty mild. To all those who say it was too confusing, it wasn't too hard to follow (at least for me). It's one of those movies that requires a lot of deep attention and similar to a movie like Inception, it asks questions but leaves audiences to fill in the blanks. That's one of the things I love about this movie, almost makes me feel like I'm in part creating the story. Don't expect clear answers, it's meant to be a movie that makes you think and theorize and it has a basic enough story that you can connect the pieces a little more clearly than something like Inception.",Oblivion
433,donegalcat,Stylish but unoriginal,5,6 November 2015,"Oblivion is a generally well made and entertaining film. The cinematography is very good, the sets, gadgets and special effects are all top notch. The film also features strong performances by Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko.Unfortunately the plot is a disaster. At times it is incomprehensible, while also managing to blatantly rips off a number of other sci-fi films, in particular The Matrix and Moon while the Scavengers even look like Predator.The film is good to look at, but brings nothing new and is ultimately a disappointment.",Oblivion

The movie is best seen if nothing has been heard of the plot before, so I won't add anything of it here. That is the way I first saw this filmSuffice to say, that both visually and content-wise I have nothing critical to add - it is a perfect movie. And that'd be the only science fiction film, I could show my wife and get out of it respectfully.

435,Kevbo1985,"Overcasted, Underfed, Average",5,19 September 2013,"Tom Cruise is a mercurial actor when you dig into his body of work, and his role in Oblivion almost seems custom-built for somebody else. The story itself is incredibly thin, but all the pieces fall together in proper sequence, and in the end, you're not left surprised so much as satisfied that things play out the way they do.For much of the early portion of the film, the overall mystery factor leaves you curious, but once they strip this away, the film does a poor job of evaluating the antagonist and its motives. Much like Cruise's role, that of Morgan Freeman could have been filled by a much lesser actor with similar results; there is simply not enough room for him to deftly navigate the film in the manner he is capable. Minor parts aside, the casting is not so much a flaw for Oblivion as it is a point of confusion; such big names need not have applied.The plot itself, as I mentioned, is thin on detail and heavy on putting things in their right place. Sci-fi goes in either one direction or the other most of the time, and as a huge fan of the genre in a film sense, Oblivion doesn't have the balance between style, substance and storytelling to truly grip me. The big revealing moments are not so much expected as they are dry, leaving a taste in mouth that is familiar, but one which you cannot quite place where you've experienced it before. A strange sort of deja vu.A few minor tweaks, and a story that didn't pat itself on the back for being sequenced properly and went further into the details of the intriguing world it only dabbles in, could have made Oblivion much more than what it is; an average film, overcasted and underfed.",Oblivion
436,SofiaParkJeon,Great sci-fi movie,8,28 May 2016,"No i'm not a payed reviewer to say good things about the movie. I'm just a regular movie lover who happens to dislike sci-fi movies but to love the dystopian theme. That being said i have to start by plagiarize a reviewer who said that Tom Cruise really loves what he's doing, and i completely agree. Every movie I watch from him, even the bad ones, he manages to get you to fall in love by his character, due to the emotion he puts in it, the man is a great actor, and without knowing it I slowly became a huge fan of his work.This movie is a bit slow paced it's true, and sometimes you can get confused by the story. Jack Harper is a commander on NASA who goes on a mission, this Jack has thousand of clones (then made to serve Tet), being the protagonist Technician 49 who later confronts another clone, Technician 52. I was a bit confuse by this, and i admit I had to do some research in order to understand the film, an attentive viewer won't have this problem though, i'm sure.The movie is visually stunning, the performances are spot on, specially from Cruise and, of course Morgan Freeman who has a small but amazing (and emotional) part on the film.I would totally recommend this movie to the average movie goer and for sci-fi lovers. Also if you love the dystopian theme like I do you'll love the movie. It's slow paced but Cruise manages to get you stuck until the end.",Oblivion

In addition, you'll have nice pictures, special effects, and totally futurist design. But if you want something new? Then you will pass What is it with American cinema nowadays? You have some Top Gun Tom Cruise playing the hero type like Armageddon/ Bruce Willis, Olga Kurylenko playing the Ripley part, the ""jackals"" acting like some weirdo from Predators or Star Wars and AI being always questionable in the Terminator way. Have you seen the Star Wars or Matrix pursuits (or even Battlestar Galactica?)? So you've seen them all. Did you look at Neo in Matrix? Then you have some ideas of the costume type. The planet? Some Planet of the Aps... No it's not spoilers, it's basic knowledge! Where is vision?? Cinema vision? What is it with this kind of Cinema? I think that America needs enemy, it's part of it identity (and I'm not judging that): that's why they (screenwriters because I haven't read the comics) have to express some common reality because SF always has been about present time. So, what are you trying to say? That you don't know anymore who's your enemy? But it's always about the same basic idea: showing off because 'I have the biggest one' (I'm talking about guns and size obviously!): shoot first and ask question later seems to be the same appropriate response and I'm tired of that monologue. Yes, there is no dialog anymore in this cinema: it's just a one-way ticket with no substance. Where is optimism or better realism? (light) jokes? Why does it want to appear so serious when it is just empty? You pay for entertainment (and earring you neighbors trying and failing to be discreet to eat!), and you fill yourself with some inappropriate moral because some of us, just being realistic, don't like the ""middle thing"": choice is about extremity because you act upon your belief for some pointless moment. Expectation? Stop!! You can have a good time: just leave your brain and knowledge of SF outside the door!

439,dragonmysterious,Tom Cruise + Sci Fi,7,17 May 2013,"When you hear Tom Cruise + Sci Fi, Minority Report will definitely come to your mind. If you haven't seen it, you probably should. Now, Tom Cruise has established himself with another big Sci-Fi film. The trailers were done well without revealing too much. In the trailers, there's Morgan Freeman and it makes everyone wonder if he was supposed to be a good or a bad guy.This film evokes your emotions, not mentioning the few comedic lines. The first part will bring you curiosity in the film. The Earth of the future. Halfway through, you get confused halfway. While trying to enjoy it, all I was thinking was that they better explain whats happening in the film later on, and it kinds of distract me from the film but awhile after I got through it, I managed to continue enjoying it. They clear up the confusion in a sort of indirect way, and you will be able to figure out whats happening in the end. After that, there will be some sad moments, but eventually, the ending is a happy one.The more they reveal, the more you will keep guessing. Till the end, I wasn't able to get with the characters other than Jack Harper(Tom Cruise)and maybe the female leads. Tom Cruise was just Tom Cruise. Morgan Freeman was good in his role, though under-developed. Although this was an original script, there were parts of the film where you could have sworn that you had seen them somewhere. For example, there was the scene where Jack was in his spaceship being chased by two robots. Somehow, I actually thought of Star Wars throughout the scene.The visual effects were really well done though. Some parts were very expected but some parts were really unexpected. Regarding the mind-wipe, Mind Wipe doesn't actually delete all your memories but it actually makes you forget them unless something triggered it. (Read Artemis Fowl books for more)Overall, this film was good considering that it was an original script and it actually managed to get this far. Is it the best Sci-Fi Tom Cruise movie? Maybe not. Is it an effective film in making you enjoy some Tom Cruise and spectacular Sci-Fi goodness? Definitely.",Oblivion

I really wanted to like this movie, but I've seen myself fast forward too many times, waiting for something to happen. Special effects were nice but it doesn't make a movie! As the movie unfold, I kept thinking that Tom Cruise doesn't want to play with other actors anymore, but only with himself, if he could. Then the next scene, here's his twin! He was really playing opposite himself! That was too much, couldn't stand it anymore. Mister Cruise is not really a giving actor, who let his co-stars shine.

Not this one however. In my opinion, Oblivion would have to be one of Cruise's more forgettable roles and to be fair, it's not all Tom's fault. What Oblivion seems to suffer from the most is weak directing as well as a weak script as the film starts off slow and the plot could have been better developed. The visual effects and a bit of the action were alright but nothing else to bother about. Another negative I found was criminally underusing Morgan Freeman in his role, it might not have improved the overall product but every little bit could have helped. A shame, really, as I was looking forward to seeing this after not watching it during it's theatrical run. Guess this is one film that wasn't worth the wait.",Oblivion

For another thing, the next movie you see will probably be better than this one. If, on the other hand, you are a regular movie goer -- be prepared to see things that you've seen before. I recognize the influence of ""2001-A Space Odyssey,"" ""Doctor Zhvago,"" ""Independence Day,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" and ""V"" (the original 1983 TV movie). Some of these films were sources of inspiration for the writer/producer/director, others were sources of plagiarization.

The effective background music makes them feel even grander. I think Kosinski's creative process starts basically from the music. It's essentially an orgasmic audio-visual fair, just like Kosinski's previous and debut film- Tron:Legacy. He's more ambitious here, and more passionate. Although, you can't help but recognize the influences behind the story-which are some sci-fi epics I won't name here-and feel deja-vu; it still never stops being exciting and interesting. Oh, BTW I suggest to listen to Oblivion OST by M83 (amazing shoegaze/electronica band) before going for the film. Really! M83's soundtrack feels like Hans Zimmer-Daft Punk-M83 all together at once. And that's effing awesome!I wait for the day when Kosinski is handed an ambitious and promising screenplay. That day, I believe, he will make a master-piece worth savoring for lifetime.",Oblivion

Right from the start, the film doesn't disappoint. It has a real depth that a lot of action/Sci Fi films don't have. A beautiful ambient soundtrack is matched perfectly to the pace of the film and in it's own right is a work of excellence that I now listen to on my iPod.The characters are believable, and as expected, Tom Cruise plays his character really well. Morgan Freeman also plays an excellent role here, and I feel was perfectly cast for his role.The special effects are very good. The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films. (The Star Wars prequels comes to mind!) Where CGI is used, it's not over the top, and blends well with the live action and real sets. The tower set is a work of pure beauty, and helps add to the bright and wide open feel of the film, if that makes sense.As I said previously, the soundtrack is fantastic, and allows me to watch the film over and over without getting bored of it. The sound effects are excellent as well. Specifically the drones make excellent noises at various stages of the film.The overall plot is very good. It has a good amount of twists, and real depth. It is all played out at a pace that seems to adapt perfectly to the story. Action sequences are fast, and deeper, more emotional sequences get the slower pace they deserve.It's funny, but it's one of those films that maybe didn't win any awards and maybe didn't break box office records.. but I find myself watching it again and again as it's just so watchable and enjoyable. There very few films I own that I can watch, go back to the beginning, and watch again right away. Black Hawk Down is one of them, and now so is Oblivion.

Oblivion shows us, successfully and entertainingly, that that is not only way to handle the genre. It succeeds in being brilliant rather than being just another sci-fi film because of the depth of the story. It's a not-everything-is-what-it-appears kind of film, and essential we are drawn into a mystery, in which the chief characters don't even know they are involved. The special effects are spectacular. OK, we know Hollywood can do 'spectacular' at the drop of a hat now, but whereas films like Skyfall and Transformers: Age of Extinction throw endless, gratuitous VFX at the film to try to convince you've seen something good, here they are used to advance the story - rather than the other way around.

Directed by Joseph Kosinski, director of the efficient Tron in 2010.Recently a lover of sci-fi movies, I got to admit that this one has a lot to offer. Visually, the movie is amazing. I personally loved the pursuit with the drone and the ship that Jack is driving in the middle. The idea stays original and it brings us to think about something, to just take a look on what the earth is gonna look like in the future, which is good, (okay, maybe the year 2017 is too soon for the planet to get look like in the film).Personally, for someone who likes to appreciate good actor performances in the movie, I think that this film was not the worst that Tom Cruise played in in his career, in terms of acting. Still Tom Cruise played in pretty not bad sci-fi movies like Minority report (god I HAVE to see it again!), Morgan Freeman is, as always, an actor of good talent. Honestly since I just saw the whole Batman trilogy I just like to see movies with this actor. But Kuriyenko's acting is just bad I think. But damn she's hot. And maybe the love story was a bit too much?Anyway I also saw some good references to other sci-fi movies like 2001: a space odyssey, which is one of my number one movies of all time. Oblivion can be a bit boring at the start but the climax for me was almost breathtaking and quite very interesting.

There is a mediocre plot, clones, fancy flying ships, and women in T-shirts and tight outfits. The ending is predictable and the characters are not really developed. Much of the story is not clearly explained. On the good side, the special effects weren't bad and the sci-fi gadgetry was impressive. If I live to be around in 2070, I want the bedroom set and the master bath in the guard tower.You may find this hard to believe, but Morgan Freeman is in the movies as the leader of the rebels. Gee, we haven't seen him in a while. It was all the way back last month when he was last seen as acting president in ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" and it will be next month before we see him again.

Kosinski has put together a science fiction movie with melodrama and Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles.Cruise has portrayed tremendous depth to his character as the person who is ravaged by the memories of his life in a pre-war Earth. Olga has been able to emote and act well but is unable to demo her depth of involvement with the character. Freeman has been able to provide a stellar support role to the entire storyline.Cinematography (especially in combination with the spectacular CGI) has been great. Editing is appreciable. Story content is gripping enough although it is very much predictable. Felt it dragged a just little long.My rating would be a 6 out of 10. Regards, Ganesh.",Oblivion
456,acocoasa78,good but still quite not up to its full potential,7,23 July 2013,"Well, when I hear Tom Cruise is the lead character of a movie, that movie sure has 50% chances IMHO to become a success, not because his name is on the credits but because he is an old fashion actor, who delivers big time: seriousness, nerve, ambition, no fake moments there! Now, about this production, I think it's quite good, it keeps you awake not knowing what's following...although the moment I saw the first transmission from the Teth, I noticed something was seriously wrong with Sally, she was somehow showing not human behavior...are u still an efficient team????? The characters were OK, all the actors performed well, I just loved Andrea Riseborough's performance by the way (solid entry), Morgan Freeman, best like always, a titan of the movies, I just love him as well, Olga is OK as well. The picture/sound OK but from the special effects side I had better expectations, I consider the effects OK but it could have been better, especially since the movie's budget is not quite low. I have only one problem, with the intrigue and the story in general. The idea brilliant although not an original one, but it could have been better implemented, I mean more twists and spins, it's not quite to its full potential i think. It gave me the impression I was watching a The Outer Limits episode, instead of a big screen blockbuster. Anyway, in this ocean of nowadays' worst movies, this is among the islands of faith. It's not wow, but it is definitely worth seeing!",Oblivion
457,tetraslash,"A solid 7 movie, nothing more",7,21 July 2013,"My rating for Oblivion is a 7. A solid 7. Compared to Cruise's other movies, there wasn't as much action as I had expected. Once again, you have a sci-fi movie with an original premise (Minority Report was great), and great acting overall, and the CG and other effects were done brilliantly.However, the reason why I could've give this movie a solid 8 (which means that the movie was done perfectly, without any issues) was because it left me with the whole ""What was the point of the movie, anyway?"" mindset afterwards. It didn't seem like there was much a point with the movie. Enough that when my mother asked me if I could watch it with my nephew, I replied, ""She probably wouldn't like it; It's nothing special."".The plot isn't defined clearly until halfway into the movie (to allow for a progressive, slow start), but by the time you realize what's happening, it's already ending and there isn't much action to help intensify the severity of the issue at hand.Your interest is held by you hoping that the movie will get better as it moves along, but with the pace of the movie held constant, you end up just watching it and not really trying to consider which parts of the movie were done well.If you ask me whether this movie is worth the time, it is, but, only if you're a sci-fi fan and/or a Tom Cruise fan. Freeman isn't a major character, so don't bother looking for some spectacular performance from him.",Oblivion

This film however has got to be one of his worst. As stated in numerous other reviews........this is so reminiscent of Moon but without the superb story and acting by Mr Rockwell. Plus the meeting of the two clones just didn't have much tension in it ...or maybe I was missing something. You'd think that those who are in the movie biz would be aware of films with similar plots etc.... The effects were very good but that wasn't enough to pad out a film that was slow paced and really rather dull to be honest. I wasn't sold on the relationship with his wife either, they didn't have any chemistry at all. Shame really as I though it was going to be so good as well. I have given it 5 out of 10 only for the effects and the Morgan freeman was in it. Otherwise I would have given it less.",Oblivion

Amazingly derivative plot...,3,7 September 2013,"I went to see this in the cinema, knowing nothing of the plot except that it has Tom Cruise in it.This film, as others have already suggested, is a mishmash of sci-fi films from the last 30 years. In itself, that is forgivable if it makes the story it's own. It doesn't. It starts well, and the special effects are stunning. It even does a fairly effective job of building up the suspense. Regrettably, once the reveal is done, or should I say started, thats not enough. Oh no, now they have to explain everything, literally spoon feeding the answers while you are tied to a chair. And then it turns into Independence Day. Despite my abysmal rating, it is a visual feast.

But its still worth it. There are so many movies today that are like others,its part of living in the time that we do. Just because you have seen something before does not make you super intelligent and allow you to have a self righteous smugness.Tom Cruise does a good job this time around, he really does, the last thing i saw him in was Jack Reacher and i hated that and i hate most of the movies he makes as i usually see the same wooden performance over and over again,so believe me i am not a Tom Cruise fan-boy by any means. But credit where credit is due, he did a good job. He played an emotional part at the ending and it was quite good.Olga Kurylenko didn't do much , she was okay, and Morgan Freeman was the same as he always is. Overall the movie could of done with being about 20 minutes shorter so id give it an 8 out of 10 for that but apart from that small complaint Im very happy with my viewing and I happily would watch again.",Oblivion
462,krirks,Underrated Sci-fi,9,13 December 2013,"Before I watched this film, I didn't know what is it about or read any synopsis. I bought it just from the poster. The opening is very convincing. The CG, the set, outfits, vehicles really help building up the atmosphere of the future. The story line is refreshingly new. You don't know what will be going on next and it keeps you curious about it. The action scene happens occasionally along the movie in the right amount of time. The drama scene, however, is a little too much for this kind of Sci-fi. Tom Cruise nailed it as usual, the role suits him well. The whole plot is a typical American action style, nothing to expect here. Anyway, The best thing in this movie is the graphics, both computer or non- computer graphics are mesmerizingly stunning. Everything is beautifully designed. It's one of the best as far as I have seen in Scifi category. I give it 9 out of 10 just a little bit mistakes here and there but overall, highest score from me.",Oblivion
463,TheTerminatorsky,"Visually great, plot wise a mess.",7,8 June 2013,"For starters, this movie makes no sense. In the words of Mr.Spock, ""It is illogical"". While watching it in the movie theater, I did like the scenery, FX, CGI, set design was impressive; However, the plot did seem like a rip-off of many sci-fi movies such as Blade Runner, Moon, various Twilight Zone episodes, 2001, Stargate, Planet of the Apes, Total Recall, The Matrix, etc.>>> Warning, spoilers below <<<2 NASA and 1 Russian astronauts are sent on a space ship to some planet. On the way there, NASA detects an alien ship. The astronauts are told to investigate. As they do so, Jack Harper launches an escape module with the female Russian astronaut(Julia), who just happens to be his wife. The NASA ship is pulled inside the alien ship (referred to as TET). Then TET destroys the Moon, makes thousands of clones of Jack Harper which it uses to invade planet Earth. Humans respond with nuclear weapons, seemingly defeating the aliens... or, as JH is told and we are led to believe.Now here is where it gets rather silly: Then, 60 years later, clones of JH and Victoria believe they are just 2 people remaining on Earth. The clones have no memories of the past as they are led to believe their memories have been wiped.All the humans have somehow been re-settled on Triton. How could humans after a nuclear war built space ships, and ifcourse housing on Triton is unexplained. But alas, humans need water, thus we have these giant water-sucking things stationed on Earth. Aha! Why didn't anyone think to just clean up Earth instead of spending resources to build ships and transport water to Triton?But wait, if the aliens were defeated (eventhough TET is still there) wouldn't more of them come later to avenge their dead?1st: why keep all the JHs and Viccys a secret from each other? Seems pointless and counter-productive. Had they been told they are clones, why would their mission been compromised? Apparently, each team was told not to go beyond their own zone because of radiation.2nd: 60 years after being ejected from the ship, Julia crash lands on Earth because the rebels have finally figured out how a beacon works. She is rescued by JH, and is told (as JH believes) of what has occurred. However, certainly Julia realizes that neither her husband nor Viccy have aged at all. Thus, she laughs at their story, and seeks the truth by recovering the ship's voice recorder. As some have mentioned, why does the recording of the cockpit still continue after the escape module was launched?3rd: Where did TET come from, what is its purpose, why is there only one, etc.? Isn't there plenty of water on other planets, comets, Moons of Saturn, etc. Why start a war with nuclear armed humans? Why didn't TET show up on Earth 100million years ago when there were no humans and dinosaurs walked around? Even 200 years ago humans would not have been able to fight off an alien invasion.Also, since water has been contaminated why would humans need it at all?4th: Why was a giant robot, which was hiding in the basement, needed to kill just 2 people? Why wasn't dynamite placed at the legs of the house instead? Or air and heat shut off, or gas pumped in? Or food and water delivery stopped?5th: Can 2 people really tolerate each other for 5 years? As Oscar & Felix prove, they cant. Now, 5 months I could understand; and in fact I was expecting them to be on a ship in reality. Also, Why didn't Viccy have kids, was she or he sterile? The script wasn't thought over very well. Now, yes, other sci-fi classics do have plot problems as well; check the FAQ and boards for 2001, how could an astronaut leave his ship without his helmet? If HAL wanted to kill all onboard the Odyssey, it could have just opened all the doors, or shut off the food and water, or reduce temp to -200f? Why do apes on another planet speak English, but humans are as dumb as monkeys? How could Skynet have built a time machine, but no metal could get through, and be so stupid as to send a cyborg which obviously does not blend in with the populace? Why did the Death Star have a huge hole big enough for a plane to fly into? How could an alien ship leave behind a strange looking creature like ET on Earth?",Oblivion

465,elmeeksio,Epic Sci-Fi with some great twists!,8,15 April 2013,"Sci-Fi movies nowadays have the tendency to be clichéd stories or remakes of old ideas, using similar characters and threats, it's not very often that a completely original idea comes along. Oblivion is one of these movies, offering both different and unique plot points, some great acting from all three leads, fantastic design and visuals and spot on directing. The story of Oblivion (taken from an un-published Graphic Novel) introduces us to a post-invasion planet Earth. After an alien invasion wiped out most of humanity, we are told that we used our nukes to end the war. 60 years have passed, and Earth is now a partially radioactive wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), is a member of a 'mop-up' team tasked with repairing drones and eliminating any remaining alien threat. But when Jack is captured by a group of humans, their leader (Morgan Freeman) tells him that things are not what they seem and that everything he knows is a lie. Director Joseph Kosinski is actually the author of the novel the film is based on, and so from start to finish this is his baby! Kosinski creates a frightening future world with Oblivion. The smoothness of many scenes and the way the film constantly holds both tension and intrigue to the viewer is so good that you forget, this is only his second film. The performances in the movie are also superb, with Tom Cruise being on top of his game as our hero, Olga Kurylenko was mysterious and sexy in her role as the survivor that Jack saves from a shuttle wreckage. I was a little disappointed that Morgan Freeman didn't have more screen time, but at least he was great in the scenes he was in. The effects were fantastic, everything from the apartment above the clouds to the ship Jack pilots all looked not only futuristic and cool but also completely plausible which I loved!In conclusion, Oblivion is a great sci-fi movie. It has a love story, great plot twists, stunning visuals, all the elements to make it a classic. However, this is by no means a film without flaws.. there is a particular revelation scene towards the end in which I spotted a pretty major continuity error, that I couldn't work out how they didn't notice it or maybe it was deliberate..i don't know! All in all, I loved this film. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen. To enhance the experience though I would suggest avoiding spoilers so it doesn't ruin the twists in the movie.8/10",Oblivion
466,morgie55,We make an effective team! Tom Cruise Scores on This One!,9,22 April 2013,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE THEATRICAL VERSION.""Jack Harper: 60 years ago, Earth was attacked. We won the war, but they destroyed half the planet. Everyone's been evacuated. Nothing human remains. We're here for drone repair. We're the ""mop-up crew"". If you want to see a fun film with romance, excitement, plausible futuristic inventions, weaponry and computer-control, complete with Big Sister and the apparent salvation of the human race, watch this film.The film's beginnings concern an apocalypse of sorts, where in 2017 Man won, at a terrible cost, a war with an alien invasion. The remnants of that war, fought by the alien Scavs, want Jack (Tom Cruise) but not to kill him but to capture him. The cloud condo (I like to call it) has everything, complete with swimming facilities, showers, food and a hot red-headed, Brit-accented woman (Victoria) who also happens to be Jack's lover and communications officer. Every morning Jack goes out on patrol, fixes downed drones, and they complain to ""management"" up in ""Tat"", a large module miles wide, that is shuttling the last of humanity to its new colony on Saturn's moon, Titan. And every morning the communication from Tat asks , ""Are you an effective team?"" and all hell will break loose if it's other than ""Yes!"" Who could ask for more? There's more to the story than that. We are introduced to an apparency. And like Matrix, there is more than meets the eye and all is revealed, in bits and pieces, as the alien resistance, led by Morgan Freeman's character, Beech, is also not all it seems. Plots and Points:I won't reveal much, just to say the story will be familiar to many sci-fi fans. The action is non-stop (but it's not a military film), and the story slowly unfolds (but it's not Matrix). The plausible machinery (the dragonfly-like helicopter-ship with space travel capability) and Jack's cool, futuristic motorcycle are fun to watch and experience.The film's expostulation of what our world will be like is shocking – New York is completely wiped out. We have the library, subway system and the Brooklyn Bridge at hand. What sci-fi movie does NOT have the Statute of Liberty's arm up in the air, a common feature in these types of films since the Planet of the Apes!Best scenes: Getting your cycle stolen from aliens. I mean, that's really a shame! The humor as Jack catches that ball at the stadium, site of the 2017 World Series. And the hideaway that Jack keeps, a mountain lake and cabin, with remnants of humanity's technology (great Jazz vinyl) unknown to his partner Victoria. When a signal brings down Odyssey, a ship that's been in orbit ""pre-War"", and one survivor, a woman who had been in his flashback dreams, completely destroys all the harmony and substance of Jack's world and sends him on a frantic hunt to find the truth or meet elimination at the guns of drones! Bottom Line: If you like your sci-fi with great scenes, seamless CGI and a constant plot with no pausing, then see this film. The film does take some concentration and if you're observant, you can follow along just fine. In fact I may get the DVD to fill in any points I missed. IMAX, was worth it!

467,feudalserfer,Alternative Plot; Tom Cruise friendly,8,2 February 2014,"60 years ago, the Earth was attacked. We won the war but reduced the planet to Birmingham, or Wansworth, or Stoke on Trent, maybe. We're the mop up crew. It's hard work mopping an entire planet. Everyone else is on Titan. I believe that. Just as I believe L. Ron Hubbard was an alien overlord and you can't tell the difference between Stork and butter. I believe that.Is it possible to miss a place you've never filmed in, a role you were different in, a time you've never lived without the aid of greenscreen? We won the war, but now we have to help giant Remington shavers suck up sea water: are the drugs they give us legal, or what? Our commander is Sally, who bears a striking vocal resemblance to Hal 9000, and who we have never seen, but still believe her home spun southern drawl. Victoria and I are obviously morons. Or clones. Or both. Yesterday, a man who looks like an older version of Morpheus from the Matrix, but sounds suspiciously like the wise old bird from the Shawshank Redemption told me everything I knew was nonsense. I told him not to be so rude about scientology. Then I went to service a droid at a calcified football stadium. Victoria tells me that's what twentieth century Leeds looked like. On a good day.When I met the women that I later learned was my original clone's wife, sixty years ago, before the world fell to the Tet, or the Scavs, or the mongs, I said: Julia, I'm with you, and I don't know your name; I'm dreaming but it feels real. Like a memory of a dream of a fantasy of a Philip K. Dick short story. What the hell's that about? I took Vika flowers. She hated them. I cultivated the last flowers on Earth for all she knew, and she preferred vacuum packed rations. You can't please some people.But after all I have learned, I realised that everything I knew wasn't real. I wasn't real. Victoria wasn't real. Sally's accent wasn't real. And despite being beaten up by myself to save money on stuntmen, I went in search of the house he built. He's a lousy builder. Did he use a spirit level? I think not. I know that, because I know him. Because I am him. I am Tom Cruise, and I am home. Playing the same part I play in every single movie I've ever been in. Clipped, nondescript, slightly odd, beating up full sized men and standing in the shadow of my leading ladies. Standing in the shadow of Legoland cars. We are an effective team.Horatius said: ""How can a man die better than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his Gods?""

468,SouthSideChgo,A Thought Provoking Kind of Sci-Fi,9,24 April 2013,"***Contains NO spoilers***The future looks even more bleak in the latest Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion, and it'll have you questioning the whys of your life and mission. Based on an unpublished graphic novel by Tron Legacy director, Joseph Kosinki, Oblivion is about one man's search to find the answers about himself and his mission. The movie opens to planet Earth, now a desolate wasteland after an alien invasion and nuclear attack, where Jack Harper, Drone technician 49, is part of an effective team with his communications partner and lover, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). Yet not everything is well with Jack ...he's having trouble sleeping due to recurring memories of a woman and being at the top of the Empire State Building continuously haunt him. Who is she? Why does this building hold such significance to him? Those questions and many more are soon answered when a lone survivor named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) of the spaceship named Odyssey crash lands on Earth and a resistance leader of the remaining human race named Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman) take presence in Jack's life. Both characters begin his soul-searching process of truly discovering who (and what) he is, the nature of his mission, and ""company"" (known as the Tet – the alien lifeforce that attack Earth for its natural resources). It's a journey that could ultimately decide Jack's fate and the destiny of the surviving human race. If you're expecting Oblivion to be a ""blast 'em to kingdom come"" type of sci-fi movie, you should skip it. On the other hand, if you like a sci-fi movie where the plot makes you think, question, and decipher clues like an Alfred Hitchcock mystery along with the main character and the action is more of a backdrop than the main focus, Oblivion is the movie for you. Joseph Kosinki, in this reviewer's opinion, did an excellent job paying homage to the sci-fi movies from the 70s (as well as borrowing a few themes here and there from current movies) when translating his graphic novel to the big screen. Throughout the movie, there are notable references to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and the 1968 version of The Planet of the Apes to Terminator, Moon, Tron and Matrix – just to name a few. Visually, this movie is stunning. This reviewer like the contrasting wasteland of mountainous and sandy desert that was once New York City and the luscious forestry where Jack ""escapes"" the ever watchful Victoria to relive some sort of normalcy of a life he once knew. There are some hidden gems in Oblivion to which this reviewer easily recognized besides Led Zeppelin's Ramble On and Procol Harum's Whiter Shade of Pale ...here's one, be on the look out for Pink Floyd's The Wall album.Even though not really a big Tom Cruise fan, it was nice change of pace for this reviewer to see him portraying a character that doesn't start off as the dashing hero but the everyday man who's reluctantly pulled towards that status by Malcolm Beech, leader of the so-called ""scavs"". Morgan Freeman's character, in an unusual supporting role this time, hones in Lawrence Fishbourne's Morpheus character (from the Matix) and the way he cryptically guides Jack to search for the truth without really revealing too much him (and the audience) at once. Just like Jack, we are made to discover it in bits and pieces when he ventures into the radioactive zone. And she liked the seemingly effective yet cold chemistry between Jack and Victoria since they are paired together as co-workers and nothing more. There's no real ""love"" between the two compared to the love Jack and Julia rediscover in the latter half of the movie. Yet the one character that really stood out in this reviewer's mind despite being non-human except for the voice (by Melissa Leo) was ""Sally"". Think of this ""character"" as what Hal did for 2001 ...she was chipper and pleasant yet terrifying with her ""are you and Jack an effective team"" (which had this reviewer wondering what would happen if Victoria said ""no"" to that question) to ""I created you Jack. I am your God"" at the end ...the most powerful movie moment that sent chills down the spine. Music done by the French electronic/shoegaze group M83 wonderfully captures the mood and subtle undertones of Kosinki's Oblivion like what Daft Punk did to his Tron Legacy. This reviewer liked how the opening sequence (titled Jack's Dream) gives the audience seemingly look at happier times while Jack monologues what happened to Earth before the attention grabbing blast of electronica seeing the movie title (think opening sequence to Daft Punk's The Grid with Jeff Bridges in monologue). Other notable tracks off the Oblivion soundtrack include Tech 49 when Jack is roaming the desolate wasteland (beautifully highlights stunning scenery a world that's no more). and Oblivion (featuring vocalist Susanne Sundfer) at the ending credits. Highly recommend seeing Oblivion on the big screen(just to see the stunning the visual effects and scenery) before it's released onto DVD/Blue-Ray.",Oblivion
469,i-Shuvo,A Sci-Fi seldom feels this good...,9,17 April 2013,"Kosinski's directorial work on 'TRON: Legacy' was rapturously received, and earned him considerable attention for his distinctive visual style. He is a student of the films of directors like Ridley Scott and Stanley Kubrick, especially when it comes to their science fiction work, and while 'TRON' showed him stretching his legs, 'Oblivion' sees him working on his own terms and sprinting forward. Simply put, 'Oblivion' is a visually breathtaking, one of the most beautifully directed science fiction films in years. Kosinski's vision of post-apocalyptic earth is both very familiar and incredibly distinctive, with sweeping deserts and dunes covering the decayed and destroyed remnants of familiar monuments, gorges and rivers where cities used to be, and a planet completely at the mercy of untameable weather. If 'Oblivion' has a protagonist, I'd dare say it is the earth itself, with Jack placed as a tiny, almost insignificant figure against his environment. Just as impressive are the designs for Jack and Victoria's futuristic tower base, slick, clean, modern and highly reflective, and completely at contrast with the nightmare of nature around it. Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda approach these rich environments with sweeping, epic photography that uses every inch of the widescreen image. The film has a grace and fluidity to its rhythm, a level of elegance that was once commonplace in the science fiction of the 60s and 70s, but now lost under the explosions and monsters of today. Adding to that strangeness and grandeur is the highly anticipated score from Anthony Gonzalez and his French electronic band M83. In a similar approach to that of Daft Punk and their magnificent score for 'TRON: Legacy', their score lends the film an otherworldly quality, distinct but intrinsically cinematic at the same time. Once again, one of the most interesting film scores of recent times has come from outside of the filmmaking world.Visuals are all well and good, but 'Oblivion' could never work on images alone. Thankfully, its narrative drive and science fiction concepts are just as arresting and fascinating. Kosinski and Karl Gajdusek's screenplay, based on the comic book also written by the director, is a strange mix of incredibly familiar and wholly original. Most of the concepts in the film have been done before, and often in major films. Very few ideas are truly original, but what makes 'Oblivion' work on its own terms is the manner in which they are executed and weaved together. To say any more would be to ruin many of the surprises, but there's a real sense of legacy with this film, that it understands its place in its genre and the footsteps it is following in. It isn't an act of homage, rather an acknowledgement of what has come before, and how those ideas can continue to be developed and explored.While the prospect of a film starring Tom Cruise seems to turn a lot of people off (I'm still not entirely sure why...), rest assured that Cruise delivers a fantastic and intelligent performance as Jack, a pared-down version of the action hero we've come to expect from him. Cruise has always delivered better performances when working with directors he trusts, and that is clearly the case here. He knows that the film itself is bigger than him, and the successful execution of the film is paramount to him. It's great to see him at such ease on screen again, but with obvious passion and commitment to his work. Just as wonderful is Andrea Riseborough as Victoria. She strikes the perfect balance of a woman both soft and gentle, and carved from ice; the camera absolutely adores her. Olga Kurylenko isn't far behind. While her performance isn't as confident as Riseborough's, she matches the style of Konisnki's vision perfectly, and provides the right amount of enigma to drive the film forward. Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo round off the cast with small but memorable, and very unusual, performances. Each actor is aware that they are part of something much bigger - a giant cinematic panorama - and it is thrilling to see them fit themselves into it with such trust and confidence.The more major studios trust in these new distinct voices, the more exciting a place the cinema will become. 'Oblivion' is a stunning return to a memorable era of science fiction, as well as something original and distinct in its own right. Joseph Kosinski has proved himself even further with this second feature, and I can only wait in anticipation for what he will do next. Films like 'Oblivion' are a welcome reminder of how powerfully visual cinema is, how it can take you places and give you experiences no other medium can. Find it on as big a screen as you can, sit back, and become lost in this extraordinary visual marvel.",Oblivion
470,chowdhurytuhin,Visually Intriguing but not Original,4,22 April 2013,"One thing about Tom Cruise movies like Nicolas Cage the focus of the story as well as the camera is irritatingly always on him. There are seldom anything on the other characters. This movie is not different. Seeing the length and slow pace in places, a sub story about Morgan Freeman's character could have been interesting. Also, the storyline is very inspired from ""Moon (2009)"" and the romance angle eerily similar to ""Vanilla Sky(2001)"". There are too many loopholes in the story. Visually its impeccable. Acting performances are also commendable. Action sequences mainly comprise of Star Wars style chases. Final verdict: There are many good movies which are ""inspired"" because of their gripping storytelling- the heart of a good entertainer.

471,FugitiveAmoeba,A Well-told Tale,7,10 January 2014,"Admittedly this reviewer is a sucker for post-apocalyptic films and while ""Oblivion"" is neither perfect nor watertight in terms of plot, it is a well told tale. The film manages to impressively scale down the entire human struggle to a personal fight for the character of Tom Cruise, who looks as good as ever. The visuals are good though not consistently enough to make a lasting impression. The film appears to draw heavily from the great works of the genre including the recent ""Moon"" and this works successfully for the writer/director Joseph Kosinski whose TRON film was a forgettable affair at best. ""Oblivion"" is an entertaining film that is shot well, paced tautly and has enough originality to deserve a proper viewing. 7/10",Oblivion

If you replaced Tom cruise with Clive Owen and Morgan freeman with Gerry Bussey, and changed nothing else, you'd see how few redeemable qualities there really were. A.I. Based aliens from outer space conning human clones into doing its bidding while it steals earths water... Hasn't this been done a thousand damn times.

473,maybakmusic,A good sci fi movie,8,18 October 2013,"This movie was good. In this film's aura and critical reception, I definitely noticed similarities to Minority Report (it was underrated). Without spoiling anything, it is clear that there are massive similarities to certain other sci fi movies... But maybe that is inevitable in this genre. It was very visual and sleek. The story was good, but I felt like it shouldn't have had such a family oriented wrap up of an ending. Plenty of movies that are legendary, ended with a bitter ending that better suited how humans actually are.One thing I noticed after watching this, was that blockbuster sci fi movies (this included) are becoming lame to me, because they are tending to assume that humans can't overpower the invaders, but must outsmart them with a million to one odds, and then throw a Hail Mary for the win. And/or change some high ranking enemy's heart to have them help the good guys. But it doesn't seem that far fetched that humans outsmart their opponents after a massive battle with huge losses, by adapting to their enemy and legitimately going over the top to destroy them. Is that really that weird? That is how humans beat everything else isn't it?Because this movie followed the popular paths, and also unjustifiably overlapped too much with other movies, it doesn't deserve a 10 or a 9. But if you like sci fi, you should watch this once.",Oblivion
474,syahputraeqqi,One of the best scifi movie in 2010s,9,13 August 2020,"I can say this is one of the best sci-fi films of the 2010s. In the 1st act or the prologue, this film feels like it's in a hurry to convey the summary of its backstory. however, you will find out why at the beginning it feels accelerated, that's because before the core of the story, you will be presented with a pretty mindblowing storyline. I really feel mesmerized with cgi treats and amazingly cool special effects.with stunning special effects, this film is also supported by cinematography techniques and magnificent scoring from start to finish. several times I found good framing in shooting some scenes, mostly scenes from tom cruise. talking, about acting, you definitely won't deny how the totality and perfection of Tom Cruise's acting is. all the cast also I think put on a brilliant performance even though Tom Cruise took all the attention to him. Lastly, I think this film could potentially be used as a sequel or made a prequel.",Oblivion
475,KoreanPenguin,Oblivion,7,17 September 2013,"Tom Cruise really isn't my favorite. Although he does do some things right from time to time.Welcome to Earth: 2077. I'm not spoiling much, because we find out Earth was ravaged by nuclear attack, leaving behind nothing but an unrecognizable, desolate wasteland. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) works as a security repairman of sorts, living with Vika (Andrea Riseborough) his wife, girlfriend, roommate, I'm not really sure. Essentially, they are tasked with the duty of repairing and performing maintenance on defense drones within the safe radiation zone. These drones defend several giant rig machines that harvest water or something to help store fuel for the future of mankind, which has all apparently moved off to Saturn's moon, Titan.Besides the unsympathetic and hollow defense drones, Jack and Vika are alone on Earth, or are they? The nuclear holocaust took place because a species of alien attacked Earth, called scavengers (or scavs). Sally (Melissa Leo) guides Jack and Vika through a holo-device, directing them on how to go about protecting the rigs on a day to day basis. Sally supposedly lives on an orbiting space-cube of sorts, called the Tet. Therein lives most of humanity that hasn't already left for Titan.I'm sure you are already lost reading my synopsis, and rightfully so, as it's a maze of a plot. Being a science fiction film, the maze only develops more twists and turns as we progress, until everything that we once knew as fact is no longer such.I haven't seen director Joseph Kosinski's ""Tron: Legacy"" so I'm not exactly sure if he intentionally likes to provide social commentary in his films without resolution on purpose. It's hard to not give away much by saying so, but there is a certain level of subtle (or maybe blatant) discussion here about our environment, and the rate at which the filmmakers believe we are destroying it. At another point, we are in a pristine, well-kept futuristic building, where Jack stands, covered in soot and dirt, a man who used to believe lies, now knowing the truth. A clean, spotless woman stands before him. The juxtaposition is clear, but at some point we are left wondering what it means. And it's not a moment where we actually want to know what it means either.The casting of Morgan Freeman as Beech seems to have been a wasted opportunity. Freeman doesn't have hardly any screen time, and the film's trailer gives him much more credit than is due; can I legally say such a thing about Morgan Freeman?Also, despite a few somewhat painful monologues with Jack raging about some ancient football game, or some classic literature, Cruise is truly in great form here.The highlight of ""Oblivion"" is in the soundtrack. If you are at all familiar with the electronic band M83, then ""Oblivion"" is sure to be a treat. The recurring theme from the film follows the aptly titled single, ""Oblivion"".""Oblivion"" is a fun science fiction thriller, with plenty of excitement and a fantastic soundtrack. Hollywood is falling deeply in love with post-apocalyptia these days, and being fan of it myself, I can't complain.",Oblivion
476,Sage-c4,It's okay...it's okay,7,20 April 2013,"I saw this in IMAX, so it was very big and very loud. It also seemed a bit long, somewhat predictable, but not boring.A simple story line creates a typical Tom Cruise scifi action vehicle, differing from Vanilla Sky and Minority Report by employing far fewer supporting roles, fewer props, and bland featureless CGI backgrounds. Essentially a mash-up of Wall-e and Zardoz, with major visual, thematic, and sequence nods to Star Trek, Star Wars, Alien, Matrix, Inception, Adjustment Bureau, Mad Max, Terminator, Total Recall, Armageddon...yeah, it's pretty short on original elements. There's even a bit of Jerry Maguire and Top Gun here.Still, what emerges is a story, Hamlet or Oedipus, bent to accommodate a fairly happy ending. SPOILERS: There are a few plot devices that jar, like how the flight recorder continued to monitor the command module after separation, or the unexplained discrepancy in the fertility of Julia and Victoria, and why do the drones, which are clearly presented throughout the film as independently fueled and autonomously programmed, fall out of the air instead of continuing their attack? These issues knocked me out of the story, but since the illogic is revealed late in the film, the damage is contained. Morgan Freeman does a credible turn in a limited roll that is just a bit more passive than one wishes. Andrea Riseborough does some real acting, though it's mostly acting suspicious. Her character is actually developed too much for the purpose of the plot, and an opportunity to acknowledge her Ophelia antecedent with an aquatic mishap is missed. And if Victoria is overdeveloped, Julia, played by Olga Kurylenko, is little more than a prop. Really, a little less of Tom figuring it all out, and a little more of Olga, maybe listening to the flight recorder she was so determined to recover, would make the ending of the film more emotionally satisfying. Again, a bit too passive to engage.",Oblivion

It had almost no boring moments and the action was top notch as usual from a Tom Cruise movie. The narrative at least in the beginning was also enough to drive the story and keep the viewer glued to the screen. However, in the last 20% of the film where they had a chance to accelerate the plot and make it into a very good film falls back on itself by creating more loopholes with very lazy dialogue.I had low expectations of Oblivion due to having read the mediocre reviews online but surprisingly found it better than expected.

Wish i can see her at another movie. Tom Cruise act as Jack Harper (Why i feels like saw a Jack Reacher or something..hahaha..), his charisma astounding..Act good and shown emotion as well.The dislike of this movie: the rhythm of story that was too slow. The drone is too simple.. i imagine there would be a bigger enemies than the drone. Too many questions running in my head while watched this. I didn't read the novel or heard any story of this movie. I just did not understand who create tet and why it needs human to fix drone? why only Jack and Victoria copied though.Honestly, maybe the story was too high for me..so i couldn't imagine higher.

In the beginning the build up of the story was solid, and each of the main characters got its share of attention to make you care for it, but everything suddenly got shattered in the middle of the movie and becoming overwhelmingly confused is the least i could say to describe my emotions from that moment forward, then it became a huge puzzle which needed a big time deciphering. towards the end the whole confused thing and the continuous ""Whaaaaat!?"" expression starts to unravel leaving you with a complete picture of everything that was going on, but then you're left with this statement ""It could have gone better"", and don't let me get started with the bad guy's boss who was a complete joke. bottom line : this is not one of Tom's best movies.",Oblivion

Not much to say about this movie, I thought it was great, a much cleverer plot than I expected. Several of the unbelievable ""coincidences"" pan out to be rational as you progress through the movie, so stick with it! But there is still one coincidence that remains a constant irritation. I'd love to see and ""Editors Cut"" where they fix this. It is not giving much away to say that this takes place on an apparently post apocalyptic earth, and very few buildings of any kind survive... It just so happens that the few that do are all dead famous New York landmarks. So the goal posts in the NFL stadium survive and the coin opp binoculars on the Empire State building survive, but there is no trace of civilisation between, no other buildings, no other evidence of streets or any previous habitation.

Almost! But this is Tom Cruise of the Church of Scientology that we are dealing with over here. He is no mere man. He has understood the mechanics of Quantum Physics and is very elegantly trying to show you that there is much more to life than what it seems. We think that we are Alive, Special, with Memories. But what if you are just another clone, with some memory implants? Isn't that what God does to us, our flash-backs, our deja-vu about past lives and small memory traces of another life.We feel it, but then society has given us roles to play. To break out of this role-playing is overturning the system, losing your wealth, property, your wife, and everything that you hold dear. The physical structure will not allow you to break free unless you posses that rare suicidal spirit to destroy the System. To be the ultimate Rebel. To be like Jesus! And that is precisely what Tom Cruise does. He blows it away with an amazing performance so elegant and light, that it took we a few days to digest what he'd done right in front of me. A movie that appeared so bland initially but with so many cosmic truth embedded in it that it can easily become a video manual on Ron Hubbard's Dianetics. Amazing breakthrough story and acting. We are all clones and living meaningless and pointless lives till we really break out of the System! The title says a lot, ""Oblivion"". If you stay within the system, then you are living in OBLIVION. I think we have reached a point in Human history where we need another ""Reset"" of our Civilization.

Even after seeing the entire movie, I am not 100% what was going on. They could have really done a better job of explaining things as the movie progressed.

But thanks to the wonders of cinema my opinions were immediately changed upon a full viewing.This film, to begin with, contains some of the most amazingly stunning visuals, be it from the landscapes, CGI, models or any other facet, they are incredible and I cannot stress that enough. That alone sets this film apart for me. It is what I have come to expect from Kosinski's work after Tron: Legacy set the benchmark.Equally impressive is the soundtrack, composed predominantly by M83, it is a treat to enjoy a score that not only fits perfectly, but also provides such dramatic a feel and compliments the cinematography to the highest degree with all the subtle nuances and electronic aspects.The premise itself is secondary in my case, as I am already in such awe before even considering what merits the plot may or may not contain. That being said, certain aspects correspond very heavily to Moon, which I can see would upset some viewers who believe it to be plagiarism. But it is not to the detriment of the overall experience in any way.The actors and actresses all play their part in an accomplished manner, with Tom Cruise capably maintaining viewer interest, as a large portion of this movie features him alone.In my humble opinion this is a must see for those who bear science fiction tendencies.

492,criztu,It should have been called 'Bleakness',6,17 December 2018,"This movie commits two big mistakes:
1. no good climax
2. no good villainAnd then it feels like they didn't want to spend money on backgrounds, and on character development.The movie's story and visuals are minimal. It's a post-apocalyptic world, but instead of showing elaborate city ruins, it shows dirt. The few ruins that we get to see, are covered in dirt. No post apocalyptic world building, nope. Watch this cardboard ""rebel hangar"" propped up on a patch of dirt instead!
Very little is happening in the beginning, and that is ok, I can live with that as an introduction, allows me to focus on Tom Cruise's character. But that works only if you're going to give me a lot more of substantial stuff later on!
Nope. Seems that the makers of this movie got no budget left. Tom Cruise ate it!I can't help but compare Oblivion to 'Mad Max Fury Road'. 'Fury Road' is a post apocalyptic world too, but it has cars and a car worship religion and dudes employing a car related jargon, there's explosions, huge storms, rocky passages, cities in the distance, whence come strange characters with at least a not-boring appearance.
Oblivion is just monotonous dirt.
The world in Mad Max Fury Road affects the story thoroughly. I can feel the characters trapped inside their world.
In Oblivion, the world is made irrelevant, employed only to execute the car chase, I mean, flying vehicle chase.. Twice is Tom Cruise's character chased by boring spherical machines with guns, and of course, robots are dumb, he-he. They don't get him, and I already knew that, because then the story would end, because the movie is about Tom Cruise.
So Oblivion is ""Tom Cruise and dirt"".There's many other faults to this movie, but talking about it would be more substantial than the movie itself. So let's jump to the conclusion.
The no good climax is that it has Morgan Freeman in it. And that's a nono.",Oblivion

When that happens, suspension of disbelief is easy, and the art becomes a part of life. This is rare. Often the great story is told and the teller succeeds by bringing it to the fore and staying out of the way.A movie is a great story teller, but often the medium eclipses the message. This is clearly one that does. The polish of the production almost blinded me from the view of the movie. Great FX, immense star power, and an excellent score left whatever was the point of the movie on the cutting floor. An escape? Yes. However, as the plot developed, the lack of character pathos and reliance on amazing vistas let my mind wander. Any time the story gives you time to think, it is usually a bad thing.Tom Cruise was excellent, as usual. The rest of the cast, including Morgan Freeman, complemented the star well.

My expectations were high because the movies like this rarely disappoint you. But unfortunately this movie did that.Tom Cruise in the role as Jack is just terrible to watch. The actor that once shined in Minority report is now as stone faced and bold as Nicolas Cage in Wicker Man remake. He doesn't manage to create any interaction with any of the characters in the film. Same with Andrea Riseborough as Victoria. There was no interaction or emotion between those characters, not good or bad, it just felt like they were reading their lines from the paper. Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman were the ones who managed to point out from the characters lacking all depths but unfortunately it didn't save anything because their characters were written so badly, lacking all depth. Instead of limitless possibilities how to use the sceneries of eerie and post apocalyptic earth and its abandoned cities, the only thing we will see is a lifeless, CGI desert. In the poster we can see Jack walking on a collapsed bridge with an eerie, beautiful background. This is something we won't see even single time in the real movie. Where Mad Max and Star Wars films managed to create stunning visions of deserted planet, this movie gives the audience just vain piles of sand over and over again. Few scenes with the CGI forests and the nature are as lifeless and dry as the scenes on the CGI desert. Same goes for the scenes in tower 49. Instead of million ways what kind of visual appearance or small details it could have had, it is nothing more than a gray, dusty headquarter with nothing that could catch the eye of the viewer.The plot itself is nothing special, nothing that we wouldn't have seen already. Still it might be the strongest aspect of the movie and the only reason why the lifeless movie doesn't collapse completely.I fear the crew and the director calculated that a gigantic marketing for a science spectacle in post-apocalyptic earth, directed by the creator of Tron: Legacy and starred by Tom Cruise would become a hit and pay itself back in no time no matter how flat the movie itself was. And that is most likely what the movie will do in no time.The sad truth is that after all the hype the only thing we see is a mainstream Hollywood movie with a mainstream plot filled by low-quality acting and low-quality sceneries directed to mainstream audience with low-quality tastes.A movie that will fade into oblivion in few hours after seeing it.",Oblivion
498,damh_frikinlater,The Disappointment of 2013,5,19 April 2013,"This was meant to be the movie that would make us said: ""the summer season has started"" but it's turned out to be the greatest deception of 2013.This movie is the one thing a movie cannot be: boring. In the past few days I've heard in the media that this film was good but the first act actually was kind of slow. How wrong they've been. The whole movie is boring, second act is even worse than the first and the third is so bad directed that it makes you wish get over it. The screenplay is focused on the solitude of the protagonist when it should have been focus on the action, what Jack will do when he discover that nothing is what is seems.I blame entirely the screenwriters. It is sad to say that one of the screenwriters is in fact the Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy). Even saddest is to say that he actually is one of the creators of the graphic novel the film is based on. This is the proof that it is bad idea for a writer to direct his own movies. Take David S. Goyer for example. He is the hell of a writer, but all the movies he has directed sucks.But if you think that is some serious stuff, you must know then that the second screenwriter is no other than the Academy Award Winner, Michael Arndt. Yes, the same guy that wrote Littler Miss Sunshine and Toy Story 3. The same man that is about to give us the adaptation of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, and must not forget, that is the same man that Disney picked up to write Star Wars Episode VII. I have only one thing to say to this man: make them take out your good name from Oblivion or stay away from the sci-fi genre. The only one writer that is safe is Karl Gajdusek, because he only has written one film and it wasn't very big. So he is just a rookie making mistakes.Kosinski definitely got an F on directing. To be honest, the special effects and the production design were brilliant, amazing. That said, this film is full with unnecessary repeated scene (like Jack dreams). I can't even remember when was the last time I felt insulted on a movie theater. Mr. Director, the audience is not dump, we don't need to see a man closing a capsule, lifting up the capsule, walking outside with the capsule and putting it on a spaceship. Showing only that Jack closed the capsule and then we see it on the ship was enough to figure that he took it there. This movie is full of dump actions like the one I have just described.For those who know a little about screen writing I will tell you why is this film unbalanced. What in the film is the end of the first act should have been the inciting incident. What in the film is the first twist of the second act should have been the end of the first act. What in the movie is the last twist of the second act it should have been the twist of the first half of the second act. And the third act, well, if only were better directed. Seriously, the very last scene was unnecessary, dump, and nothing special. The film should have ended in the scene before that.If you're hoping to hear some good things about Oblivion I can say that it has 2.5 things that were good. The first one was the visuals (already said that). The second one was the cast. It was an enormous cast, full of good actors and actress, but bad directed. And the .5 is for the score. The music was good, but our great director turn it off when it was about to get better. Like he did in every single action sequence.Try not to see this on the movie, safe your money. This is the greatest deception of 2013to the date. I can honestly say that because the person who thought that G.I. Joe 2 was going to be good after the disaster of the first movie just because The Rock was on it, well, that person is an innocent soul.

499,imdb1-1,Totally oblivious to the audience,3,21 April 2013,"Did you see great visuals on TV? That's why this film gets the 3 stars I'm giving it. When it comes to story line, you've seen this before 1,000 times but much smarter in other films. I had no idea that this was based on a graphic novel, more like a bad comic book. By the end, it was clear that this film was made for idiots who can check their brain in at the entrance and worship the man name Cruise who was on Cruise Control.For some reason I allowed myself to pay to watch Cruise try to play 6 foot 6 inch Jack Reacher a few months ago. Bad idea. Gave him one last chance and came in with an open mind. The opening scene is a little murky. You're not quite sure what to make of it. Great visuals, the explanation given by Cruise is hokey, something is off but you just go with it. In short, he and his female companion are supposedly the last remaining people on earth with a job to do before they are ready to join the rest of the others in 2 weeks on Saturn. They are a clean up crew, maintaining drones that kill the alien ""scavengers"" on the planet and extracting water/minerals.Gratuitous CGI, which is done pretty effectively, leads us to the first immediate problem. When Cruise pulls out a New York Yankee hat while reminiscing about a football game, you can't help but think ""perhaps the worst and conspicuous choice of product placement I've ever seen."" From that point on, while you want to figure out some of the mystery, you're loath to admit that this script has silly holes in it the size of Saturn.Now I've seen worse but the middle and ending are very disappointing because the twists are not only predictable but so many remind you of other films. And they are also very awkwardly managed. With each twist you keep begging the film to come up with a better answer for these oddities. And as the film plods along, they are unsatisfactory.This is a good free on cable movie, not worth spending money in the theater. As a rental, be prepared for disappointment. It's Cruise doing Cruise, marching on without brains to pick up a big check.",Oblivion
500,arthur_nonimus,Channels the best of sci-fi,8,2 May 2013,"In a world where sycophants and yuppies demand to see something new every tenth of a second it's good to see that great stories can still be told. Oblivion channels the best of sci-fi to ask the most basic questions - Who am I, Why am I here and What is it to be Human? The basic run down is simple, Jack is a drone repairman. The drones are AI controlled robot sentinels guarding the extraction of the last of the earth resources. Jack's work is vital, the last of humanity is relying on those resources for it's very survival. The 'Scavs' on the other hand will do anything to sabotage this important work.Good sci-fi should examine the human condition, the cool technology and flashy effects merely a vehicle to explore not space but ourselves. This vehicle is used expertly here. Jack has a good life. He thinks everything is as it should be, but as he learns more he begins to doubt what he knows to be the truth. He is forced to ask the questions that need to be asked. This leads to a discovery that will change everything.It is not perfect though. There are two big issues - 1. Emotional engagement and 2. Story flow. The character development is not as strong as it could be over the course of the movie, as such The audience is not given enough reason to care deeply about the characters. The characters just feel a little static, not really developing much throughout. This may be because of the story's development - it went from prelim treatment to (as yet unpublished) graphic novel to movie in just a few short years. The story seems to suffer a bit from the same issue. For example there is one point where a vital piece of information is revealed to Jack and he seems just a little too willing to accept it, where as other things he seems to reject outright until literally bashed over the head with them. This turns out to be a pivotal moment but it seemed a little rushed where other sections of lesser import got more time and treatment. Again this is probably down to the short development time frame.This is a fantastic movie overall and I would recommend it to anyone.",Oblivion
501,onetoten,Better the more you view It,8,31 January 2014,"The 1st time I watched this movie it was confusing. This is a story with complex elements. The second time, the plot was easier to understand but I wasn't sold. The third time cinched the deal and the core of it was Vika, the trusting partner who was the easiest to manipulate. Andrea Riseborough deserves credit for giving the story its most tragic feature. Vika is dramatic irony on steroids. Who hasn't been betrayed in this world? Who hasn't been betrayed on a level that you can't imagine? That's Vika. If she only knew. I wish there had been more of her but it's supposed to be the star who fills the seats in the theatre. The movie is visually stunning with realistic landscapes. ""You wouldn't believe what's down there,"" Jack 52 tells Vika. For some of the reviewers who didn't like this film at first glance, you might not believe what you find if you give this movie another chance. I'm glad that I did.",Oblivion
502,FreedomWatchTower,Going average into the Oblivion,5,1 August 2018,"I watched the Film half a decade after its release, mostly for the reason of it's Score Composers and of it's Sci-Fi origins (rare breed these days).
My expectations where non existant for the simple reason for me not caring about this flick when it originally released to theaters. First up the positive: you are mostly in for a visual treat, you have beautiful landscapes, sets and designs, this is especially fascinating because of its nature. Most SciFi films about a planet where War nearly eradicated most of its inhabitants tend to look destroyed and rather ugly (not in a cinematographic sense). The Orchestral Score is outstanding, especially it's Leitmotiv, french Electronic band (here Kosinski the director goes again, choosing a french elctro band as he did with Daft Punk on Tron) M83. 
Also some cool ideas, i won't spoil, youll get near the end of the story concerning the whole premise (which also is its weakest link at the same time).Next up the Negative: You have not enough information about what is going on which results in you as a viewer just blindly follow the protagonists, which perse is not a bad thing if done right (Great examples 2001, Moon,.....). The saying ""less is more"" seem'ed to be the Mantra of Kosinski, because you get barely any information in the begining of what was going on before the Earth went exterminated and right after that you follow Cruise and his companion along the ride where you'll get tidbits of some random scenes which get explained in the end but in reality dont make any sense, because the character of Cruise doesnt remember them, so it just is for us the viewer which doesnt make sense because why show us something the main protagonist doesnt remember if we as a viewer dont know anything about what is shown to us if it only gets revealed in the end ?. If you set up scenes in the editing you have to take care that in the context they make some kind of sense for the character or the viewer, even both if the story demands for it, you cant just pull in some random scenes and in the end say ""well that was the whole reason"". As i said in the positive aspects of this film, the sparse story elements, which go down a pretty fascinating idea in the end, it also is its weakest link. The most interesting idea of this SciFi story gets revealed in the End and than it stops, Cruise saved the day and ""kumbaya me Lord"". If youd describe the film in short sentences it'll be ""Cruise is rediscovering stuff on earth and gets objectives to hunt for some stuff, there is some stuff he isnt to touch or bring back and then he finds out the truth ...the end"". 
Another big problem is the Action, while it has some cool action setups they also are pretty boring mostly, infact the whole film felt like a Video Game, but the bad kind of Game in which the variety of enemys is reduced to 1, it goes even further the Film reminded me a lot of a Game called ""Destiny"" (not my taste btw), the story has some similar elements and even pretty simmilar visual styles. 
The whole experiene felt flat with some ups but mostly downs, it felt like a franchise starter but the worst kind. What happened to the good old days where even if a film gets a sequel you still focus on making a great film and not holding of stuff for the Sequels (We'll guess we are in the Age of TV where even Movies are becoming big budgeted TV Mini Shows).",Oblivion
503,northumbia,Worst movie ever,1,27 April 2013,"It's rare to find a movie so bad that you can't find anything good in it, Oblivion is that case, even for a pop corn movie. The music comes from the worst movie tree decades ago; the acting is way terrible. This movie is like Star Wars, like I am legend, like Kubrik's Space, like Walle but without the good things: dumb, at every second; dull, at every image; stupid in every dialogue. It doesn't have any sense whatsoever: think in the most powerful machine, a machine whose radar can detect anything, even lies too, but no bombs. Boring, senseless, predictable, is just a manual of how to waste everything. Watch it, please do it, you will realized that your time is so precious that is just unfair to waste it in crap like this.",Oblivion
504,somnorosu2002,Biggest oversight of the decade,9,24 June 2014,"Not sure if this was just in Europe, but this movie is one of the biggest oversights in recent years. I mean, wow! There are so many (mediocre) movies getting so much attention lately and yet I heard nothing of this movie. No trailers, no commercials, no posters, no reviews, nothing. And that's amazing seeing how this is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in a very long time.I do understand that it is not a 'mainstream' movie, like Star Trek, Transformers or Prometheus. Movies that all got a lot of attention mainly due to their predecessors but didn't quite deserve it. Well this one actually does.The screen writing is brilliant. Other than a few omissions here and there, everything is perfect. It keeps you guessing the entire movie and it doesn't disappoint in bringing an awesome conclusion. It also stays away from most clichés in Sci-Fi nowadays. I'm not gonna give anything away because this is the type of movie that even the slightest hint can spoil it.Then there's the cast. I don't think I even need to mention the cast actually. Just look at it and you'll realize you are in for a treat.After the cast you have special effects, story-telling, acting, cinematography, soundtrack... everything is top notch.I loved every second of it and I am putting it right up there with Serenity as one the best Sci-Fi movies that did not get enough attention even though it deserved every little bit of it.",Oblivion
505,michelhovenkamp-1,Enjoyable movie but full of plot holes and lacking explanation,7,30 July 2013,"I was really looking forward to this movie, i watched it, enjoyed it but I feel the movie is lacking.First of all nowhere in the movie it is actually explained why the big alien is extracting resources from planets, it just makes no sense. Somehow it just decided to go to earth and start draining all the minerals. Also if jack is one of the clean up party shouldn't there be a bell ringing when there is literally no one else around who he even has contact with besides Julia? Also why would an alien obviously this powerful need humans to win a war for it and risk them somehow turning against them, just for repairing the bots? Would have seemed a lot more logical to just send in tens of thousands robots to win the war.I also felt that too little was explained about what the entity/alien really is. Also it felt a bit cheap that the entire war was explained by Morgan Freeman in a small monologue. Don't get me wrong, its a good movie. The special effects are great, the sound is great and I kind of liked the lonely/unreal feel of it but the story just felt really lacking. The movie has left me with a lot of questions, and not in a good way.",Oblivion

They did a very good job with it. It's an enjoyable sci-fi film, one of the best I've seen in a while. There aren't a lot of good ones coming out these days.I also wanted to point out one thing that particularly bugged me at the end. Cruise's character had a decent little speech he made to Sally before detonating the nuke, which I liked but then all of sudden right before pressing the button... he RUINED it with a seriously cheesy line...""F*ck you, Sally."" Really? And he was doing so well until that. Oh well. Overall, a great entertaining sci-fi with some fantastic cinematography.",Oblivion
507,InakiArias,"Not a perfect movie, but definitely a sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece!",7,18 April 2013,"One of the main problems of the digital special effects or CGI was, and still is, the lack of credibility in some situations. For example, in the Star Wars saga, the use of animatronics achieved much better results than CGI. Better not to speak about the wild humans of Will Smith's ""I'm Alive"", for me a fact that changed that film from being great to just entertaining.In this film the use of mentioned CGI is simply flawless. The design of the scenarios, landscape, robots is brilliant, the same as the movements and the sensation of ""solidity"" (I'm sorry, my English level isn't as brilliant as oblivion's special effects).I think that thanks to creators like Cameron, Scott and, of course, Kosinski, that technology has reached enough maturity for being considered, at last, as believable as the animatronics are plus the lot of advantages that it carries itself.Following with the plot and how the story is told, Oblivion isn't a hard sci-fi movie. It can be more considered as a light sci-fi/fantastic movie, nearer of ""Stargate"" or ""Startrek"" than ""2001"" or ""the road"". But don't get confused. Even if Oblivion bets for the classical action-adventures structure (specially in the film's second part), the first part introduces a story and a setting which invite to think and letting fly the imagination to both average viewers and hard sci-fi lovers.About the cast and their acting, even if this isn't Oblivion's strongest point, the overall result is satisfying. Jack Harper, the main character perhaps lacks of some complexity but Tom Cruise makes a great acting.In the first act and in the climax of the movie he's enormous. Andrea Riseborough makes a enigmatic and interesting acting. On the other hand, both Kurilenko and Freeman are extremely misused. For me, the worst point of the film.In conclusion, Oblivion shines and fails in the points that this kind of film has to. And that is the reason for which this movie can't be considered perfect. But, believe me, the shining points are extremely brilliant and the mistaken points are much more forgivable than in the most of this kind of movies. A must see film, fully enjoyable and entertaining (126 minutes never passed so fast) with many details of quality. A reference in technical concepts and a new classic masterpiece of the genre.P.d. Tom is back!",Oblivion
508,filmguru11,Oblivion Movie Review,7,20 July 2014,"Oblivion is the second film from director Joseph Kosinski (TRON: Legacy) and thankfully its miles away from the debacle that was TRON when it comes down to a good sci-fi movie. It is evident that he has learned that visual effects isn't everything in a movie and added a human emotional back story to an otherwise tried and tested Hollywood blockbuster.The movie begins with visuals of a washed out Earth and Cruise's voice over narrating the events that have occurred unto this point. An alien race called Scavengers (aka Scavs) have invaded Earth for its resources. Humans won the battle but lost the planet and have since relocated to Saturn's largest moon - Titan. The humans have installed large fusion reactors that convert seawater into energy for their survival on Titan, and to protect them from the Scavs attacks have stationed medium sized orb like machines called drones.Ever so often the drones take a hard hit after a Scav attack and drop down like flies. This is where Jack Harper (played by Tom Cruise) comes into action to provide tech support and security. Jack along with his beautiful and intelligent communications officer Victoria (played by Andrea Riseborough) are the only human survivors on Earth and are ordered to continue on their mission to protect the reactors and drones from the Scavs attacks.Jack is a highly trained efficient soldier and is played effortlessly by Cruise, as he pilots a high tech vessel, smoothly drops down ropes and engages in high end action. Something we are accustomed to expect as seen in Cruise's other blockbusters namely Top Gun, Mission Impossible and Minority Report to name a few. Andrea Riseborough does a splendid job with her performance as her character constantly shows signs of intrigue which keeps you guessing which side she is on. Olga Kurylenko's character was vital in pushing the plot forward but her performance was generally dreary. Morgan Freeman has very little screen time, but does exactly what he's expected and shines in his wisdom preaching General.Oblivion shines beautifully when it comes to the aesthetic look of the film. The movie has fused innovative visual effects along with a variety of picturesque landscape shots and uses it to its advantage. We see glimpses of notable landmarks lying in ruin throughout the film, which works better than the post apocalyptic destroyed city setting used time and again in many movies.Even though Oblivion from the outside looks like a complete no brainer action blockbuster with its futuristic visuals, the human element in the story adds some emotional life into the movie. The movie does take inspiration from other sci-fi classics like Planet of the Apes, Total Recall, Independence Day, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Matrix. But even though it has borrowed various elements from the aforementioned movies, Kosinski has managed to balance it well with his story and derive something fresh and exciting. The performances were top notch throughout the film and Tom Cruise has once again proved that he is still capable of holding a movie on his own and sealed his superstar status. Oblivion has all the essentials that make a great sci-fi film with brilliant landscape shots, amazing visual effects, engaging story and excellent performances.",Oblivion
509,wesawyournoobs,Wow! Fantastic film,10,26 April 2013,"I generally find myself enjoying Tom Cruise movies, and even remarked that I was going to go see 'generic Tom Cruise movie' when I went to see Oblivion. Couldn't be further from the truth! There are some general things that always seem to be in every movie of his - action, riding a motorcycle (seriously, is that in his contract? to always ride a motorcycle?) - but this movie had a lot more depth to it.It was really a fantastic movie, well-written and well-made. The scenery was absolutely beautiful (they shot at the top of Hawaii's tallest volcano for a 360 view). The effects were great.Whoever came up with the concept had a great imagination. Although there were definitely some things that were straight out of Star Wars (if you've seen both you'll get what I mean).I really really enjoyed this movie. It was a joy to watch and whoever decided on the soundtrack deserves major kudos. Procol Harum! There are some plot holes and inconsistencies, but nothing that will bother you too much.

I don't like writing long and complex reviews and the holes I found in the story line would need more examination than the shroud of Turin,,, so allow me to be flippant, why would aliens clone tom cruise to conquer the world when they must have had a well worked out plan before they bumped into him? why then reset his memory after the rest of the toms had nearly wiped out mankind so he would now think he was a steward of the earth engaged in mopping up?? after 60yrs of nuclear annihilation where did Morgan freeman buy his foster grants? Why beat up the moon it wasn't interfering? How did the scavs know there was a pod in space floating around for 60yrs with the crew on board and where did they get the technology to bring it down?

It becomes clear early on that this isn't a just another generic action movie looking to make a quick buck, but a film that GIVES A DAMN about itself, its story and atmosphere, its music, everything, and that is all too rare a thing these days. The imagery is iconic and leads to a number of the most beautiful scenes I've seen at the movies in ages.In addition to being a visual triumph, the story blossoms in jawdropping ways. I always try to avoid watching too many ads because they often give away too much, but the way this one unfolded caught me off guard again and again. Cruise does some of his best work ever and the rest of the cast(particularly Olga Kurylenko, who was wasted in the sub-par Quantum Of Solace) match him scene for scene. The beautiful, futuristic M83 score completes the picture.If you're a fan of Moon, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, or video game-wise, Mass Effect, Fallout and believe it or not Bioshock, you'd be very well-advised to check this one out.

514,walter2-1,"Draws from almost every other sci-fi movie out there, adds very little",5,18 April 2013,"This movie is visually amazing, no question. I have to give top marks to everyone that put this film together, they did a great job on presentation. Too long in some ways, but visually great. Acting was all of good quality. Plus, I had just been to Iceland the year before, and recognized the scenes, it really captures the stark beauty of that place.About halfway into the movies, I started to get a strangely uncomfortable feeling that I was watching some other movie, everything seemed to have come from somewhere else. Scene after scene had that eerie deja vu quality to it, that made me think of another movie. I guess not much is truly original any more, but this really seemed to borrow just a bit too much, without adding much of its own.I was OK with that sensation until we got to the end. It's as if the writers just gave up, and having gone so far on borrowed plot bits, suddenly realized they had no good ending to support this huge $120M effort, and tossed in a final few sequences that are illogical, and deeply disappointing. I felt truly insulted by the ending, it simply is poorly executed, and was quite abusive of the patience and attention of the audience. It really brought home the critical value of good writing, and how its lack can undo the efforts of so many others in a film. this film could have been a 10, but really missed that mark thanks to the last 10 minutes.My advice is to leave 10 minutes before the end, that way you will leave with a good feeling about the film, and not have to put up with the finish, which will only disappoint you, especially on later reflection.",Oblivion
515,stefbuik,Apple Design meets Post-Apocalypse,7,17 December 2013,"Imagine the designers of Apple getting their hands on a not-too-bad script for a Sci-Fi movie. Story is fixed, they may design the props. In other words: The looks/set-pieces are outstanding, pure minimalistic stylishness. The story is well-crafted, but in the end rather un-revolutionary.--I watched it on blu-ray, and the quality of the imagery is really impressive. The Icelandic locations make for a quite un-American background very befitting of the somewhat dystopian setting: (spoiler!) An Earth, slowly being sucked-dry by ginormous installations for..ehh.. what exactly? For something called ""The Tet"" A Space-pyramid thingy.Tom Cruise plays Jack, a repairman that's sent-out to repair armed drones that are programmed to sniff-out ""Scavs"" the ""Aliens"" that apparently tried to take-over earth, but were bombed to kingdom come with nukes. Or so Jack is made to believe.In the end it becomes a rather slowly developing, complex story involving clones, wiped memories, Alien A.i. and whatnot. Some people loathe Oblivion for that (but especially for it's slower pace).True, it's a rather slow pace through the whole thing. Yet, here&there It has some good moments that make it feel like some Northern Scandinavian Movie, with it's minimalist and sombre looks, the main character doing the ponderous, internal turmoil-thing etc, but it lacks the depth and total depressing qualities that define many of those Nordic movies, and the lacking of those qualities sadly makes it look a tad pretentious.Suffice to say, the average ""big 'splosions every 2 minutes"" public will most certainly not like this movie. Same goes for those that expect some deeper, philosophical undertone.I have to be honest here. The director did try to get a ""Nordic"" feel, and does have some good moments, but in the end is too American in his way of showing f.i. ""action"". Too loud, too colorful, too many kitschy interludes (lovers in a swimming pool..ugh.. ) Stuff, frankly, clashes here&there, making for a somewhat unbalanced experience. It feels like he was on the right track, but lost his way in post-production, trying to cater to ""the bigger audience""My biggest gripe? The music. It is too bombastic. Too in-yer-face. Something that irked me to no end. Hence the 7And Cruise is still too much the ""petty American guy"". Kurylenko, on the other hand does inject a bit of non-Americanism in the movie with her peculiar beauty. Although, her acting? Ahem. Not too shabby for a former clothes-horse, but no Oscar material, for sure.Luckily the overall design, and specifically the director's choices for the rather cold coloring of -especially- slower moments, elevate this movie above popcorn-fare, and even successfully evoke a Space 2001-sense here&there, something the director hints at in the extra's.

519,jamieradford,Oblivion reaches for the stars – and almost makes it,7,9 August 2013,"Based on an unpublished graphic novel written by director Joseph Kosinski, Oblivion is set in the year 2077, on an Earth rendered mostly uninhabitable due to sixty years of war with alien invaders known as 'Scavs'.Most of humankind has migrated to Titan, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are stationed on Earth to maintain drones that service gigantic power reactors which supply energy for the new colony. From station Tech 49, Jack flies down to the surface to locate and repair the drones, while Victoria monitors him from the station, hundreds of feet above the surface of the planet. Due to security protocols, Jack and Victoria's memories have been wiped, and their only human contact, albeit by radio, is with Sally (Melissa Leo), who is based on the orbiting space station the 'Tet'. Although Jack's memory has been wiped, he continually dreams of a young woman in a New York untouched by war. When a drone goes missing, Jack descends to the surface to locate it, but what he finds makes him question everything he believes in.Oblivion is visually stunning. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda - who won last years' Oscar, and also worked with director Joseph Kosinski on 'Tron Legacy' – has done an amazing job in his first sci-fi movie.The script, written by Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt is solid, also attempting to be as accurate as possible concerning the science involved within the story. An important element for many sci-fi fans.Tom Cruise does a fine job as Jack. No matter what you may think of Cruise personally, he is a fine actor, and one of the few that can easily make the transition between drama and action and pull it off successfully. Or, as in the case of Oblivion do both.He is ably supported by the rest of the cast which besides Riseborough and Leo also includes Olga Kurylenko as Julia, and Morgan Freeman as Beech.Joseph Kosinski has done a fine job of bringing his graphic novel to the big screen. Although the film is a sci-fi flick, there is enough drama and twists in the plot to appeal to a broader audience.Oblivion may not be the best sci-fi movie ever made, but it holds its own compared to many in this genre, and is a highly entertaining couple of hours. 7.5/10",Oblivion

521,printzr,Comparisons to real life and morality,9,8 May 2013,"Oblivion was a movie that stunned the audience as well as me for its multiple plot twists and intriguing mystery. The beginning of the movie started with questions about who the main character was, and what happened to Earth. Slowly throughout the movie, we get subtle hints through variable glimpses, flashbacks, and memorable items as the main character walks through his main mission. His main mission is all that was given after he and his partner/wife undergone a memory wipe operation that left them clueless about the past.As the mystery unraveled and questions started to become clearer, more deeper questions arose, such as what the secret agenda is behind the mission and the morality behind his actions?I identified myself with the movie because I question morality behind actions with regards to the United State's foreign policy. Like the main character questioned his mission, I question the mission of the United States. Is our involvement in other countries moral and in what interests? Likewise, the use of drones in the movie gave a glimpse of destructive nature of drones in other countries such as Pakistan or Afghanistan. It is almost as if the director of the movie timed the release at such a critical time when Congress is currently deciding what our policy with drones are and whether to intervene into Syria or not. And for that, I found the most intrigue.",Oblivion

I don't know why, it's not my fault - I may not agree w who he is in real life, but, dang it, I like his movies and find him charming! To the movie: I liked it. It has a fair number of loopholes or gaps in logic that simply don't make sense, but, I'll allow it. The overall premise is very interesting and there are several good twists - some you may be able to see coming depending on how ingrained you are in scifi culture.It's overall a clever movie, pretty good acting, nice eye-candy, and absolutely gorgeous cinematography and special effects. Wow. Just blown away by that aspect. The artists of this movie really deserve credit because without them this movie would be nowhere on the level it is.",Oblivion
523,muligens,A thing of beauty,9,26 May 2016,"First and foremost, Oblivion is a visual experience. The locations, set design and prop design are all absolutely stunning. The languid pacing allows the viewer plenty of time to take it all in which is great if you like that kind of thing but probably quite annoying if you don't. Luckily I'm in the former camp. It evokes memories of 2001: Space Odyssey at times, even if the movies are quite different in tone.The soundtrack also really works for me. I am a sometime fan of M83 and he does some of his best work here. Sound design in general is also very impressive.But visual and aural stimulus alone doesn't make for a great film. So, does it hold up in terms of plot and acting? Plot-wise, it is somewhat derivative. But the script is interesting enough to keep my attention and has enough twists to keep things interesting.As for the acting; Tom Cruise does what he does best, which is being Tom Cruise. I'm not a huge fan but he does this kind of thing very well. No qualms about his performance here, he is very good in this. Certainly among his very best performances as far as I'm concerned.Of the supporting cast, only Andrea Riseborough is given enough material to shine. She does very well as the somewhat tragic figure of the movie. Olga Kurylenko is a bit more wooden and her performance is merely serviceable. Morgan Freeman is always a joy to watch even if he doesn't have a lot of screen time. The minor characters have very little screen time but are convincing enough. I wouldn't call this a character driven movie but I can't fault the acting.Overall, there is not enough heft to this to call it an absolute classic but it's certainly a very enjoyable movie. I have watched it three times now; once at the movies, once on DVD and once on TV. I will definitely be getting the Blu-Ray at some point so I can watch it again with the good picture quality and great sound it deserves. A visual and aural feast indeed. 9 out of 10 stars.",Oblivion

These are all kept me to the end without feel bored. It was shocking for that The way it is shown from the beginning of the movie was what actually happened to earth and humans and in the end it is revealed that this is a opposite of what was told in the beginning. It was literally shocking for me. Because I had no idea what was going to happen. Also The way the Alien Ship and the Destroyed Moon are depicted from the earth and drone chasing scenes, action sequence everything perfectly captured and play on screen. Every characters did their best. Specially I like Victoria character more than other characters. She is gorgeous, beautiful and wonderful acting.

My husband and I guessed the twist ending. Not quite guessing everything that happens but enough of the story. I was just hoping there was not a twist I had seen before such as Matrix and I got what I hoped but, there was some elements of the Matrix and 2001:Space Odyssey.It was okay. The ships, motorcycles and other tech was cool. There were some big explosions, some over the top. I was very reminded of Tom Cruise's Top Gun character with all the flying was done in Oblivion. If I am being honest I would have to say I am glad that I did not pay $10 for a movie ticket. I was not really surprised by anything that happened but did enjoy the characters.",Oblivion

All films have some aspect of unreality to them, such as dialogue and plot pacing, and small inconsistencies do not immediately destroy the total value of the artistic piece as a whole. And at least they aren't Avengers Endgame sized plot holes....But overall, this movie is a work of art. The cinematography, design, effects, music, and yes, even the script, are all artistically done.

529,Andy-Wheale,"Fresh, Visually Unprecedented, Emotional, Uplifting, Classic.",9,25 July 2013,"There is very mixed reviews on Oblivion, I can understand why, the plot is not flawless, other than that this movie is not far off perfect.Visually, its unmatched, there is no other movie in existence that combines the actors and absolutely incredible backdrops with this level of crisp, clear, sublime CGI. No shaky-camera, quick-cut nonsense, everything plays out nice and wide, a visual spectacle.The soundtrack is second to none for the genre, even critically compared to the likes of Blade Runner.The acting is AMAZING, I am not a Tom Cruise fan, i've always found him underwhelming, this is his best performance by far, the supporting roles (although few of them) are all absolutely solid too, absolutely integral for a film with such few leads.Plotwise (NO SPOILERS) I thought it was very, very good, the pacing is absolutely fantastic, it starts of slow just to ease you into the surroundings, and the momentum just expands gradually and appropriately in an exciting, edge of your seat fashion.There are many twists, a couple of which I figured out just before they were revealed, and several that absolutely blew me away. One thing I liked about this too is although it's relatively easy to digest on the surface as the film rolls out, it will leave you (in a matrix/inception sense) thinking deeper and deeper into what you've just witnessed, even promoting yourself to add ideas of your own. Some would say this is a bad thing as it should be clear in the film, others (including me) think there can be nothing better than a Sci-Fi film that plants a new concept and ideas in your head that cause your mind to fizz up after :D.If your thinking of watching this film, do yourself a favour and don't research too much into it, i've put everything you need to know in this review, its a superb film that anyone of any age can enjoy, and you will experience emotional, mental, visual and audible excitement from start to finish. A real masterpiece.",Oblivion

This moon is terrible place for humans. Granted, it has liquid lakes an rain, but that is liquid methane we are talking about! So, no oxygen, no water and terrible cold. 2. Why go thru that energy hiperintensive cost of destroying a Moon only to scavenge water from earth? Jupiter moon Europa is 100% COVERED with water! Why not go there and work in peace? 3. Why ""scaws"" at the start hide their appearance from Tom? Makes no sense. 4. So what is the deal with radioactivity? At first, there is zones, later it comes to conclusion there are false borders. After nuclear war? 5. Why all of the clones go to age of 50 Years old like main character? 6. Why mother ship cannot recognize nuclear warhead, but can tell if is main character lying by his breathing and heart rate? 7. If water is somewhat sucked up (as we see from all those scenery and big fusion stations), how comes so much clouds in the area? ...........

The story was original and kept you guessing with twists and turns along the way. The special effects were outstanding, the best I have seen since Star Trek. No obvious CGI and the sound and visuals were just amazing. The acting via Tom Cruise as the main dominant character with good support actors all played their parts well and completely believable. Tom Cruise is now producing and acting in some brilliant movies, I was never a big fan but I am now. Script was clean,concise with no lag time between action,scene and story development. This all leads to a fascinating, believable on the edge ride for the viewer. When the movie comes out on DVD this will be on my list as movie I will watch several times.

""Vanilla Sky"" and ""Minority Report"") that is dramatically entertaining and very thoughtful and relevant to our world today, as the best sci-fi is. Its examination of the ramifications of using drones clearly reflects on the Obama administration's use of the same, including the difficulty of defining the enemy, etc. On a larger level, the film examines the necessity of cultural and personal memory (see the title) for individual and social identity, stressing the importance of tradition and books, as opposed to the electronic distractions of the moment. Finally, all of this is related to the environmental disaster of our own world that is allowing its irreplaceable resources to be exploited.

This seems to be a growing trend here. Movies have actually been getting better in the last half decade and yet audiences are getting more cynical. Oblivion is so much better than the 7/10 it's currently rated at on IMDb. Yes, there are some familiar ideas contained within the plot, but it definitely stands on its own, and the film is a visual masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Oblivion is better than all the modern Star Wars movies put together.

534,interquam,Screamers(Philip dick) + Star Trek: voyager,8,12 April 2013,"Amazing film!!!!The film is an exact rip-off of Philip dick's second variety, in fact is a skewed prequel and can be called as 'The chronicles of Commander Joseph Hendrikson'..This film champions Tom cruise as an 'actor', instead of making films where women want to have sex with his face. Worth an Oscar, but even Oscars are denigrated. A method actor. As he grows older, looks tough and natural and can dole out solid films like this for the next 10 years at least..Zoe bell didn't say a word. But you really need real people like her and not actors for every damn role. Really levels the film.Olga was tom's love interest , but kept the subtlety of the film. No hype---she's one reason i watched a tom cruise film, first time in my life. A woman needs to be a woman.The film even goes on to show the Freemason's symbol or superpower or elitism etc etc that shows all power concentrated at the top and people being sheep, well technically they are all clones of Tom and Andrea Riseborough!! Excessive lethal control. If you do not abide by the fantasia provided and privileged to you, you are eliminated by war machines, as in using a drone to kill an ant!And then there is the star-trek theme...when voyager( V-GER)leaves for deep space and returns with nothing but absolute intelligence in the voice(or form of a woman) persis khambatta in the original and Melissa Leo in the new.From 2017 till now(2077) a superpower or Alien intelligence controls Earth with lethal absolution, using humans as the element by eliminating any threat and making them oblivious to their existence and control. It also goes on to show how tom and his trophy wife provided to him live an amorous life unable to live naturally. Always monitored and audited by machines. It has taken them so many years and clones and they are still unable to have discrete control.Nice film to watch...really spans well...the tron guys did an awesome job.....considering they have done not many films but really it takes nearly 30 years to built content to get the ball rolling..Animation was ace... and the sound, BEST ever in a film!!!!!!! As a critic and film hater the sound was unlike any film ever heard and synced well with the animation. It really shows you don't need ridley scott, hans zimmer or pixar to make a worthwhile watch..This film is a cult, 20 to 30 years i see a sequel or remake....a no-shocker.Here's looking forward to Riddick!!

535,aaronadoty,Exquisite production and great performers wasted on feeble script,5,10 November 2015,"This film looks beautiful. The ravaged Earth, full of the detritus of civilisation; the lovingly designed aircraft and drones; and the house that looks like something from the Jetsons brought to architect-inspired life. They are all stunning, and the film lingers over them, rightly proud of their magnificent, on-screen realisation. Cruise, Freeman, Riseborough and Kurylenko all turn in solid performances, but the show is stolen by Leo as Sally (""Are you an effective team?"") even though she only appears as a video image, and mostly in grainy black and white. GoT's Costner-Waldau is wasted in a cardboard cut-out role.Ultimately, however, the film disappoints time and again through its shoddy script and tiredly predictable, pasted-on action sequences. The film is at its best when nothing much is happening, little or nothing is being said and you have time to just gaze at the gorgeous eye-candy.As with the original cinema release of ""Bladerunner"", the expository voice-over narration at the start is a mistake and serves only as the first example of the many disappointments to come in the ham-fisted storytelling.",Oblivion
536,KaDaWe,As Unrealistic As It Can Get,4,25 August 2013,"I hadn't had big expectations before I watched the movie, but sadly these still weren't reached. ""Oblivion"" is a movie which could have been great, but failed due to unrealism and mistakes.The story itself is well done, but maybe it would have been better if it had been shorter. The technical aspects are amazing, the landscapes and the whole world look great. Tom Cruise plays pretty good either, the same goes for Morgan Freeman (but I think that's self-evident).That's nearly everything good I can say about this movie. The worst part is that the movie is, like I've already written above, unrealistic. Most of the things that keep you wondering are mentioned in numerous other reviews, so you can read them there. Other than that you can say from the beginning on what most likely will happen. And besides Cruise's and Freeman's characters most people in the movie are replaceable.This are just some of the things that I think made the movie a below-average one. So, altogether I can't give it more than four points. That's pretty sad, because it could have been really great.",Oblivion

I've just watched it on the TV and came reeling to IMDb to see what I was missing? Nothing, apparently. It's just awful. I thought the remark by one of the metacritic reviewers that maybe the film was a deliberate parody of all Cruise's other roles was interesting and plausible. Why would anyone want to do that? Did the Scientologists pay for this rubbish? Of the many films people have referenced in their reviews, from 2001 ASO to The Matrix, via Top Gun and Planet Of The Apes, no one seems to have spotted the homage to The English Patient in which the pilot of a crashed plane leaves his wounded female passenger in a cave promising to return for her. But unlike TEP, Tom does actually bother to come back.

Although not seeing the invading alien's true face does not add much mysteriousness,at least it's different.I'm a sucker for British literature, I'm also deeply interested in Roman history. So the quotation of a Victorian poem about an ancient Roman hero certainly makes me like the movie more.Andrea Riseborough overshadows Olga Kurylenko with her brilliant performance. Andrea even impresses me more than Tom Cruise does.Tom is a great actor who's passionate about his work.But movie after movie after movie he plays the hero who saves the world,just like Morgan Freeman who's always the wise old man.(Though to be fair, we really love world-saving heroes and wise old men.)And again,Andrea Riseborough's subtle performance is a highlight.",Oblivion

540,bumpy-3,Tommy get your TOP GUN!!!,5,26 April 2013,"I will admit this is the first TOM CRUISE movie I have ever had the pleasure to lay my eyes upon, but it's not been from a lack of trying. In 1990 I purchased a secondhand VHS copy of a film called DAYS OF THUNDER, but unfortunately there was a film taped over it called COCKTAIL and I didn't stick around to watch the whole thing. I took the tape back to the flea market where I'd purchased it for $9, but the stupid stall was closed! I went back the next weekend and the owner's daughter told me that all sales were final and that I would have to keep the tape. I ended up opening my own stall at the Big Old County Flea Market and Swap Meet in June of 1992, and guess what the very first thing that I placed out for sale was? If you guessed that VHS copy of DAYS OF THUNDER/COCKTAIL then you win. It was also the first item I sold (for $4.50) at the booth, though if I'm remembering correctly it's also the only item i sold that summer back in 1992. Nobody wanted any of my other items, which were mostly old undershirts my recently passed father left behind. I also had about a dozen old (but still functioning) screwdrivers and two old (but not functioning) hammers. The tools had also belonged to my father, who died the previous winter of a cancer in his brain that had gone unnoticed until it was too late. He for some reason hadn't wanted to even try to fight it and in the end he just gave up. OBLIVION left me speechless. The visual elements were by and far the most impressive I have ever seen in a TOM CRUISE movie, and the sound and music were top notch. I looked up the music players and it says the songs were made by a group called M80, just like the firecracker, which makes sense because the effects and sounds in this movie sometimes reminded me of watching a fireworks display. Not exactly like one, but it invoked the pleasant and slightly excited feeling one gets while sitting in the park on the 4th of July (or the 3rd or 5th of July, which I personally hate when it happens, but I guess because of permit restrictions or weather or what have you they sometimes just have to go ahead and do) waiting for the fireworks to begin, and the tingling you get on your neck and spine with the release of each firework. This movie (OBLIVION) also made me think of the end of the fireworks display when they shoot off all the rest of the fireworks at once and it's all a grand display with a wonderful payoff. In the end, I will be recommending OBLIVION to most of my Algerian friends and all of the guys I know who grew up in Ethiopia. An old friend of mine once told me that if you have the knowledge and the inspiration, all that's left is to take action, and TOM CRUISE puts this saying to life with his performance in OBLIVION.",Oblivion

542,atreus_4971,"Excellent, wonderful, a genuine classic.",9,2 February 2014,"Straight off the bat - Brilliant movie.OK, so it recycles a few ideas, but what art doesn't? This film is worthy of the attention of both die hard scifi freaks and the general movie going public alike. It's the best film to come out of the good ole' U S of A for a long time.When I saw that Tom Cruise was starring I was a little skeptical, but then I remembered Last Samurai so I thought 'Ok, give it a chance'. And there were indeed odd scenes, where he kisses his wife he is a good three inches taller than her, but when they are striding heroically in the next shot he is two inches shorter. This is a minor incongruity and actually quite amusing.So where to begin with my praise? A tough question! The acting was very, very good. The CGI was top notch. The stark and lonely feel of the film was perfect. But, the story, oh the story! The way it is so well paced, convoluted but not confusing. It opens like a flower and you exist in moments of revelation. If you want to be gripped you will be. If you want a yank film with a story, this is it. If you want to feel for an instant how fragile we are, there is an app for that too. This film is monumental in it's possibility, it's wonder. The conclusion skips and dances before your prediction, you are never quite sure what or who is the bad guy, good guy, hero or monster.Oblivion is probably the best scifi flick to come out of Yankland in a very long time. I urge you to watch it, but keep the wife quiet or you will miss its subtle beauty.Incredible story. Great film.",Oblivion
543,My_Pet_Mongoose,Style Over Substance (But it's a style I like),7,25 July 2013,"THIS REVIEW *DOES* CONTAIN SPOILERS.Oblivion is almost very nearly the film that it so desperately wants to be: an intelligent, meditative, mind-blowing, sci-fi action epic about Humanity's last stand against a monstrous alien threat.I absolutely adored the look of the film--the comfy little house in the clouds, the not-your-father's-Jetsons-car, the shattered Moon, the empty wasteland vistas of a ruined Earth, and the not-your-father's-ED209s-drones. The art direction, cinematography and direction come together to make this, for me, a very rich visual experience. I'll take this sort of thing any day over the A.D.D. chaos of a Transformers film or the seen-it-already visuals of the Star Trek reboots. It scratched every kewl sci-fi itch I had. The director knows his visuals.The acting is solid, though its nothing that will end up on anyone's highlight reel. Cruise's character of Harper gets the lion's share of development here. Everyone else is sketched a bit too generically to be memorable (a common fault with movies budgeted at over $50 million nowadays).Unfortunately, the movie fails in the plotting department and takes too many cues from other films. Is it too much to ask for my smart sci-fi films to be smart? I don't mean ""not really stupid"" but actually smart. Is that possible? Case in point: It's implied that the cloning of Jack and Victoria by the Tet assists it in draining the earth of its natural resources. But, given the technology level of the Tet, this clone work force doesn't seem particularly necessary to justify the elaborate process. I hard sci-fi story would have and I found Oblivion's laziness disappointing.I gather the Tet somehow downloaded the minds of the original specimens to keep their skill sets but then modified the memory portions to keep the clones under control (explaining away the changes with a security memory-wipe fiction). There are too many questions here and no answers, which is problematic when the conceit is so central to the storyline.Other quibbles include Victoria's gray dress and heels. Why exactly? So she can play Suzy homemaker in the sky? Seemed a little sexist. Morgan Freeman's goggle-shades just seemed weird. Everyone had cool guns, though, so there's that (priorities!). But, in the final action sequence, Cruise dives out of the way of a slow-moving fireball in a trope that's 20 years past its expiration date.I'd also like alien invasion film in which we defeat the baddies in some way OTHER than: 1. The aliens making a grave miscalculation about hospitable conditions on Earth and perish (Signs, War of the Worlds).2. Us nuking the mothership (everything else).Still, I found the faults of Oblivion mostly manageable in comparison to other the far dumber sci-fi action flicks of recent years (Cowboys & Aliens, Battleship, Transformers, Star Trek reboots, etc.) and really enjoyed myself. For me, the spectacular look of the film is enough.",Oblivion
544,darthchris19,"Predictable, but very entertaining",8,30 April 2013,"You will benefit a lot if you do not watch the trailer I noticed. The trailer shows too much and it makes the obvious twist in this movie even more so obvious. First lets go through the cast. Tom Cruise did an excellent job as Jack and Olga Kurylenko also delivered as Julia. Their chemistry worked in the movie and I believed in their part of the story. But other actors chiefly Morgan freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Kingslayer in Game Of thrones) were criminally underused and had just a few bits of dialogue. It would have been better to cast lesser known actors to fill their role. The story itself is very interesting yet as most people will notice, highly predictable. Still there is enjoyment in this film since it is very beautiful to look at. The cinematography is excellent and the special effects are top notch. I was never bored during the movie and there are some plot twists that surprised by the time I was done watching. It might not be the summer blockbuster you were waiting for but you will not go out of the movie theatre disappointed!My rating: 7.5",Oblivion
545,fk7951,"A New Ground for future Hollywood Sci-fi, Well Done...",9,13 August 2013,"This movie is extraordinary. Firstly, the plot seems absolute future oriented and unimaginative visual scientific environment. Secondly, this movie grips all possibilities of excitement and pace, when seen seriously on big screen or Blue Ray DVDs. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who has seen Starwars, Independence Day, Star Trek and Star Gate etc. The concept is simple, its all about aliens and invasion on earth, in the form of human body, directly replicated from only two people, Tom Cruise and his partner Andrea Riseborough. Though they don't kill humans but repair the drones (killing machines) manufactured on 'tet' which kill people where ever they go. The machines (rigs) manufacture something from sea water, that I couldn't understand but got an idea that these machines produce some kind of energy which helps 'tet' to stay alive in space, just above earth. Tom cruise also helps in maintaining the rigs and help 'tet' to get power from the same. The real adventure begins when Tom Cruise's real wife arrives and changes everything, the daily routines and works done by both people comes to an end and a new story comes into picture which gives further excitement and entertainment in the movie, see for yourself. This movie is a worth watch.",Oblivion
546,patyjchoi,viewpoint on cloned human beings,7,28 July 2013,"I want to leave out all the other comments which were mentioned by other reviewers here. The movie is like a grocery store selling all kinds of SiFi movie concepts such as alien's invasion, mass cloning of a human, conspiracy theory, messiah who dies for the earth peace... I do not want to be sarcastic about those factors. This is quite a well made SiFi movie, for highlighting Tom Cruise. It is another His movie.One particular point I want to say is; approach to cloning has been slightly twisted in the film. Remember ""Sixth day""? Adam Gibson(Arnold Schwarzenegar) realizes he is a clone and help his original Adam beat villains. The end? Cloned Adam leaves for his own life.But in Oblivion,it appears that two cloned Jack 49 and 52 are identical person to Julia. Whether DNA is same or not, Jack 49 is just a clone of the original one. They are DIFFERENT entities. The movies seems to claim, All the Jacks' are under one soul. As long as they are cloned from one Jack. This logic is very stunning and brand-new. And it is a dangerous concept I think.Personally I do not agree the philosophy flowing under this movie. Very uncomfortable, and now what will be the end?",Oblivion

548,XanderDevil,"A search for truth, yet no answers are provided",6,27 April 2013,"""A veteran assigned to extract Earth's remaining resources begins to question what he knows about his mission and himself."" That is the IMDb synopsis of Oblivion's plot. I went in expecting a science fiction movie about a protagonist that uncovers magnitudes of answers and truths that go against all his taken-for-granted knowledge.The movie started in an intriguing way, showing us the decimated world wrought by war, and the routines of the protagonist, Jack, and his partner. The visuals of the movie are very well done and it was awe- inspiring to see, ironically, the beauty of such destruction. The cinematography was very well done – I was immersed in several of scenes due to the fashion in which the movie was filmed.The storyline, however, is a giveaway. It is extremely predictable at times, and it takes the protagonist on a path for truth that leads to a puddle of answers. I expected Morgan Freeman's character to provide some answers, and I expected the characters to be more inquisitive and prying for information. However, the characters were satisfied with the face value of the truth handed to them. I wanted to learn more about the world, and I was learning about it vicariously through the characters. The lack of lore presented in the movie left me hungry for more, and I ended up walking out of the theatre empty.Overall, this movie is a rental at best. The acting and the visuals, while good, cannot compensate for the lacking story.",Oblivion

551,malfunkt-1,The sky lounge - the only redeeming quality in this movie.,5,19 April 2013,"Hey look, I'm glad that you liked it. I can understand why some might, but for some us this movie is not very good.If you haven't been exposed to the many common Hollywood and sci-fi movie tropes that are in this movie, it might come across as novel or original.The movie tries so so hard to be many things. Its ruined by being so obvious, predictable, and too long.Stuff I liked (major spoilers) The Tet, has given its clones decked out space lounges in the sky, complete with pool and lattes. The Tet has some architectural design cred, how evil could it possibly be? You have Morgan Freeman, being the same quasi-presidential-leader he's been typecast in since that meteor movie. Its almost just a giveaway having him on the cast.The puppy - yes this movie has a poor dog that gets tazed. Its always puppies, never some street cat.Americana galore - you'll be given a tour of American landmarks conveniently placed throughout the film. You'll even take pit-stop and chill at lakeside cabin and listen to ol' records! Might as well have had him open up a fridge of Budd.The children, saved as an emotional contrivance for the end.Drones, and more drones - fairly easy to render CGI drones that are none-too-bright.Clones and more clones. Why does the Tet not just make androids to do its bidding, why bother with fallible humans? Oh and the score has some huge bass drops, and is just way over the top, but not in a good way.I found this movie to be an odd mix of Moon, Total Recall (old and new), Portal (videogame), Mass Effect (design and music), and Terminator. The problem is all of these are better standalone.There was potential here, it was just over-cooked.",Oblivion
552,bunji999,Style Over Substance,6,1 June 2013,"Oblivion is an average movie. Tom Cruise is entertaining, Morgan Freeman is underutilized, Andrea Riseborough carries out her duties admirably, and Olga Kurylenko is simply amazing.Oblivion's post-apocalyptic landscapes are beautifully done. So much so, that I wish I'd seen it in I-Max. Actor, sets, and CGI seamlessly meld together. Lesser films slap truckloads of effects onto the screen in hopes to distract you from their substandard writing or actors. Oblivion does not suffer this fate. Visually its a work of art.The story left something to be desired. I can forgive using so many different elements from different sci-fi films. Its hard to have anything truly original these days. What turned this film from thoughtful, fun, and riveting to dull, plodding, and tedious was the pacing. I felt like I was hit over the head repeatedly with flashbacks, Jack's sanctuary scenes, and relationship building scenes. I thought to myself many times, ""I GET IT ALREADY! MOVE ON!"" Character development is indeed essential, but Oblivion did so at the expense of the narrative. I believe I would have felt differently if they devoted some of that development to the survivors' stories or went into more visual or spoken detail of how the Earth fell.The ending was predictable. I felt the film had room for one more surprise, and they missed a golden opportunity to do something spectacular. The audience has come this far and its time to pay them off! I took my 13 year old daughter to see this film. I'm rather irritated an F-bomb was dropped at the end. Filth is a crutch for lazy filmmakers. I'm surprised it didn't warrant an 'R' rating.In summary, Oblivion came off as self-indulgent art-house crap trying to be deep and thought provoking and it failed miserably on the latter two counts. The action, acting, and landscapes do warrant a viewing, but do so with the understanding that its unnecessarily long and underwhelming in places. Oblivion is definitely a prime example of style over substance. Rian Johnson, Stanley Kubrik you are not.",Oblivion
553,frodo_unplugged,The electro magnetic heart,5,1 October 2021,"Tom Cruise could just as well have played a character named Tom Cruise instead of a guy named Jack Harper. I swear this Hollywood monolith must have an electro magnet instead of a heart at his core. It's silly all too sterile fun. The characters are as artificial as the surroundings in which they move around. Morgan Freeman appears as the only truly free man in this production, but then appearances can be very deceiving. At least he projects some of that human quality of his earlier roles in this present screen reincarnation/avatar/cipher (take your pick). On the positive side, it makes for a great demo disc for all your new and fancy 4K home video equipment. A generous 5/10 because I dig polished surfaces.",Oblivion

555,kytetiger,"A nice movie to watch, but far from being an innovator in the field of science fiction.",7,9 April 2013,"Oblivion (2013)Jake and Vika are technicians responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of drones on the Earth's surface in 2073, ravaged after a disaster.***Attention, this review may contain spoilers***The premises are told at from the beginning of the film and we follow , the technician Jack, walking on the surface of the grid 49, equivalent to the former island of Manhattan, rediscovering, remembering and experiencing nostalgia for the lost memories of human civilization. There are many references throughout the film over typical entertainment from the city, and we feel happily the reflection from the passions of our dear Tom (Amercian Football, motorcycle, Yankees, etc.).. He plays less extravagantly, but offers us an enjoyable game.It also allows us to see at the same time the establishing of the character of Jack. He is curious and open. He is smart and has a good mind. This aspect is crucial in the development of character and in his quest for truth. So we follow with a singular eye the story, all the intrigues and revelations.There are two-three mysterious scenes and others with very high tensions, but the overall pace suffers from many tractions, involving a loss of speed and generally causing a slight boredom in the audience (people were complaining aloud during the film premier at the BIFFF).Joseph Kosinski has the merit of having artistic taste, and each of its scenes are clean, well made and very enjoyable to watch. There is no crappy assembly and trembling, and the scenes aboard the small ship are pleasant. There are many shots of landscape and they are strongly reminiscent of Ridley Scott's style, for example the beginning of Prometheus.The music is rhythmic and has a broad spectrum, but the melodies, very simplistic, very strongly resemble the themes of the Batman trilogy from Nolan, and background music from Mass Effect. It is impersonal, but it still gives an enchanting effect with the finished product. Sound effects are average, and there are too much of small these overused useless little noise from all the devices (a simple lens doesn't make a sound, stop it Hollywood).The course of history is interesting, but the final feeling is disturbing. There is no originality. Furthermore, we face numerous times a deus ex, cutting net the momentum, the threat of danger and the tension of the scene, Jack feels less like a subject, but more like a passive character. It is at first delighting to find the revelations and reversals of situations, but we quickly realize that this is déjà vu. This film is much like a mash-up of, among others, Wall-E, Star Wars, Matrix, Indepence Day, The Island, Mad Max ...I also regret that Morgan Freeman did finally appear only for ten minutes throughout the film, and that the character of Julia, played by a charming Olga Kurylenko, has almost no interaction with the other characters, being more like an extension of the character of Jack. As for Vika, she remains a stereotypical female character and neurotic.A nice movie to watch, but far from being an innovator in the field of science fiction.7/10",Oblivion

This is the man Hollywood can count on.The cinematography is epic, because of that new camera they used. The CGI is superb. Tom, Olga and Andrea also easy on the eyes. Visually, this movie is very nice to look at. I love the beautiful locations (desert, waterfall, oasis, etc).The story is almost original. There are some parts that remind me of other sci-fi flicks like The Matrix and Independence Day (you'll know which parts I refer to after watching this).

558,xenoraiser,"Arresting Visuals, Vague Details",7,24 April 2013,"The fact 2012 has passed is clearly of no concern to Hollywood. An incoming assault of end- of-the-world and post-apocalyptic pictures is nigh, with After Earth, Pacific Rim, World War Z and This Is the End keeping Earth in plenty of jeopardy. The first one up? Summertime precursor Oblivion. Set roughly a half-century into the future, the movie serves up as many immaculate shots as it does derivations from previous science fiction works.Pitching Oblivion's premise doesn't necessarily make it sound like a riveting experience; Tom Cruise leads a small cast of relatively small players (aside from one Morgan Freeman) as Jack Harper. His task is to repair drones which have been taken down and left by beings known as Scavs. Truth be told, it takes a while to reach the movie's meat, and even longer to find its funky bones. Before and in-between those points are a few stretches that could've easily been tightened for a bit less seat-shifting. Twists and turns, especially of the unpredictable kind, are seldom and infrequent.One thing Oblivion does accomplish well is a certain level of intrigue, namely after the first hour. A certain twist happens that, if unsurprising, still opens up a few questions the movie assumes we've already pondered. As the final act starts to close, a sense of eminence comes forward which, if nothing else, holds our undivided attention. Concern arises not so much with the convenient ending, but the payoff stemming from the climax. Backing details are both sparse and vague, further reinforced by a brief but jarring shift in setting.Looking past the story isn't too difficult, since there are several spectacular sights to behold. If you've ever wondered what Earth would look like after every single disaster movie, Oblivion is here to fill (or show) the gaps. Since many of these come during the first act, it means the feathery stakes can rest easy for a short while. Even when the eye candy changes to slightly more action-packed moments, we still get to enjoy concise directing. You won't feel the raised stakes so much as witness them, but at least the ongoings are discernible. As our key tour guide, Tom Cruise delivers another solid performance. Most of the time, the entire movie falls on his shoulders. Thankfully, he's versed and competent enough to handle this without stumbling or overreaching. And since this is Mr. Cruise, it just wouldn't look right for him to not have at least one attractive lady beside him. In the case of Andrea Riseborough, we have a better take on what would normally be a simple caricature. Some of her emoting feels unnatural, but the unease her character goes through is pleasantly convincing. This is more than what can be said for Olga Kurylenko who, though not bad, doesn't have enough material to work with. Most of her scenes seem forced in. As for Morgan Freeman, who comes in rather late, he really doesn't have to act to convince the average audience member. That said, he works out just a bit more than the character would if portrayed by anyone else. Other than the visual quality, what will probably stand out to film enthusiasts is just how much Oblivion borrows from other sci-fi movies. 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Independence Day and even Armageddon merely lead an all-too-obvious list. Thankfully, while Oblivion can't stand half as high as some, it does exceed the lesser works.While the true juggernauts of 2013 still haven't been released, Oblivion isn't necessarily a minuscule player. Those who have yet to verse themselves with most fundamental sci-fi films might walk away feeling floored. Other, more acquainted viewers will want to see this as a homage to its forefathers, which is touched upon at certain points. Keep your expectations modest and the end results might be enough for you to afford it a recommendation.www.recaphub.com",Oblivion
559,Jaguara333,I am rather confused by the high reviews,5,28 May 2014,"(Mild spoilers near the end by comparing to other films)Pros: Production values are excellent CGI is seamless Action, flashing lights and booms (WHOOPEE!)Cons: Plot quickly degrades in second half of film All major plot elements are stolen from better films, and poorly executed here in comparison So much of this left me asking ""why?""I am from the old school, and a good sci fi film for me needs more than just cool special effects and some action. Almost 1/2-way into this film I actually thought to myself ""Hey, this film is really good"", it was building up to something, and while you had an idea, you were not sure what. Shortly after that, it all went downhill.(spoilers begin here)First off, so much of the actual premise of this film is stolen directly from the much better dramatic film ""Moon"". Not just in the premise and use of the clones as cogs in the machine - each set being manipulated through how reality is presented to them...but right down to the radiation boundary zones keeping the clones from running into each other. The thing is the premise made a lot more sense in Moon - where humans were using humans - presumably because it was easier for us, with our limited tech, to do that than to build machines that would be versatile enough to do the work. However, why do the aliens and/or their computers in Oblivion use humans to do their work on earth? It is an interesting and devious plot device, sinister to use ones own kind against them and all...but it just doesn't make sense. One can presume that a technology that is space-traveling for resource gathering, and whose automated drones are the bane of earthlings (only really effectively fought with alien weapons built for the clones)...one would think that they would have the technology to build maintenance drones as well, no? Instead of having a system in place that works everywhere, this alien force uses a strategy of finding an alien life-form on each planet it encounters, hoping that this life-form is suitable to maintenance tasks on its drones, then cloning them, adapting an entire system to be able to deceive them, feed them, house them, etc...it just doesn't make sense when they could just be having worker drones.Second, the quasi-knight like human warriors...with absurdly big guns. Yeah, OK, whatever.The computer that wants to meet the enemy? Why? The existing system clearly works well enough to have removed most of the oceans. It is clever enough to analyze voices and heart rates, but cannot conceive a potential betrayal - even after this clone has defied orders in so many ways, and been contaminated by the influence of humans?This computer intelligence that can monitor heart rates etc, is unable to notice by any means that the passenger taken into its core is male, not female? Not by satellite monitoring, not by life sign analysis of the pod, not by mass analysis of the spacecraft it designed...not by any means.It has no defenses, yet allows a potentially dangerous force into it's most vulnerable position...makes total sense.I won't even go into the fight scenes, like how a super-high-tech-AI- alien drone can't aim or out-fly a limited human in a craft also designed by aliens...it must be, because, you know, the human mind is so much more precise than super-intelligent-alien-made AI-drones.Overly long sports references...because sci fi fans love sports, right? Hey guys, maybe if we throw in something about the superbowl and let him wear his Yankees hat then we can broaden the appeal of the film, you know? I am amazed they didn't find a way to work in NASCAR (Or did I just miss it?)I am sure if I thought about it more, I could go on...but just like so much in the last half of this film...I have to just ask ""why?""",Oblivion

The films effects are very good and Tom Cruse and Morgan Freeman are perfect for this lovable Science Fiction Movie. The movies story line is very good and stays true what is going on but it does have a couple of twists in it at the end and about half way through the movie. The movie is set in 2077 and you find out that 60 years before the the planet was at war, the moon was destroyed and the planet went nuclear in the end they won the war but lost the planet.

This movie was okay, not super great, but not bad either. I would be just fine with never seeing it again. I'm a HUGE sci fi and fantasy geek, but this movie didn't really do it for me. The plot was VERY slow to progress and I kept wondering when things were gonna get going. Honestly, the last 25 minutes of the movie were pretty great, but everything before that was kind of boring. The movie actually had an ending that I liked, which kind of surprised me.Other posters are right, this movie smacks a little bit of the matrix and a few other well known sci fi movies, but nothing really stood out. Everyone said Avatar was a rip off of Dances with Wolves, but that movie was brilliant. John Carter was considered a flop, but that is one of my favorite movies and every time I watch it I love it more and more. This movie is kind of ""uh...I've seen it, time to move on"".My advice, get this on redbox or at the library and see if you like it before you go out and buy it.

The acting average.. with Olga stealing the show. Without this it would be a 3/10.The plot, like that of Wall-e, centers on somebody repairing robots in a desolated broken world unaware of what's out there. Unfortunately, Oblivion borrows too much from Moon and 2001 a Space Odyssey. Here is where the proverbial wheels come off the wagon. Not only are Cruise's pretentious soliloquies vague with so little story to support them, but the plot has gaping holes and the most unremarkable obvious plot twist I've seen in decades. A far superior example of Sci-Fi is Book of Eli.Oblivion feels like $10 mil art-house movie despite $120 mil budget.

It starts off at a good pace and shows you a post-war earth filled with nothing but deserted land and ruins. It does well in giving you an idea of the magnitude of the battle between the humans and the ""scavs,"" the alien race that attacked us. It feels a little bit like I Am Legend for the first half if you've seen it. The second half explains everything, including a mind twisting revelation. The reason I give it a 6 is because it leaves you with a bunch of questions unanswered. Where did the alien come from and why? HOW did they wipe out earth? (only the aftermath is seen in the movie) What does the alien ""Sally"" plan to do with this deserted earth? Does Sally only want to do something when every single last human being is dead?

Perhaps not the ultimate sci-fi movie (for that I would want to have my mind twisted a bit more, and to see more of exploration of the unknown possibilities), yet it does have enough exploration for me to meet my sci-fi standards: question of identity, question of what it means to be human, question of the meaning of life/death, question of true love...So, yes, if you like sci-fi movies that touch your mind as well as your heart (and not only your eyes and your ears), you will probably enjoy this one.",Oblivion

Well I can confirm that is completely the case, throughout the entire film I couldn't help but find myself spotting similarities with Moon, Independence Day, Star Wars and a fair few more.That all said I still found it enjoyable to watch. It was an interesting approach looking at a human being used to destroy it's own planet. Quite an interesting idea, although it seemed a little unnecessary seeing as surely the robots could look after themselves? and once they had sapped all of the 'energy' out of the sea to power their drones what would they do with the thousands of clones they had on the ship?

572,timo-hellmund,Better than the critics say,10,21 April 2013,"This film is a feast to the eyes for every SciFi fan around the world. Kosinski once again showed us that he is one of the most visionary directors in Hollywood. After two movies. The visuals are stunning and the huge camera pans over the landscapes show Iceland in all its beauty. Yes, there is a place on earth which really looks like this. Most of the landscapes were no CGI, they were real. The set design is interesting as well. Very sterilized, clean but high-value. This also counts for the design of the bubble ship, which every helicopter fan would love to fly with. M83 and Trapanese made a fantastic soundtrack which fits to the film perfectly and even is very enjoyable when listening to it separated. It differs from TRON Legacy in its style. The electronic elements are far more in the background, the orchestra is more in the front. Which is fine, despite the fact that the theme / melody is not as catching as the TRON Legacy main theme. Other than that, M83's score is on par with Daft Punk's work and I hope this time, the score will be a candidate for the award season.The story is good as well. First of all, it is better and quicker and with less slow-downs in it than the TRON script. The SciFi elements are nice and interesting and everything is explained within the movie though some are clearly SciFi and only make sense within the movie's logic. Some questions however need to be interpreted by the audience. The film wants the audience to think about it after the movie is over. Which seems to be a problem for film critics. ""Needs more than 1 brain cell? That's a PLOT HOLE!"" In fact, there are no plot holes if you just pay some attention to what's going on. The action sequences do their job quite well. The camera is not as shaky as in other action films in recent history and the sequences are well paced and well positioned during the 2 hours length.The plot has a lot of references to older SciFi classics (those critics interpret them as rip offs, which is not true). However, the film still has its unique feeling, although you can pick out every reference quite easily. For me, the final climax is no rip off. It is just a huge tribute to one of the most iconic SciFi films of all time. The characters are above average, though some actors could have done a better job. Some emotional scenes do not add up because of the very 'dry' acting.Oblivion is better than Tron Legacy for me and I hope the film will become a success despite the unfairly bad reviews by ""top critics"". Shame on the (american) film critics who only seem to be able to bash Tom Cruise and the 'full-of-tributes' plot. This film is way better than its Rotten Tomatoes score. It is a great, not perfect start to the 2013 blockbuster season and one of the best SciFi films in the past years.Visuals 10/10, Soundtrack 9/10, Story 8/10, Characters / Actors 8/10",Oblivion
573,oxjf,"Overally a good movie, but definitely not original",8,14 April 2013,"I have to say , overall i loved the film, it had a very tron/ star trek (2009) feel with some good music, but it was very predictable and heavily stole from other movies such as MOON, (the guy who is alone on the moon) and well, tron in terms of its visuals.But the biggest thing that got to me was the scientific errors, most specifically the helicopter thing that the main character flies in, they make a big thing of it showing the swiveling engines and zooming in on the tail rotor, but here is the thing, if its got two independent motors on either side, why does it have a tail rotor?It can be to turn or counteract torque because the main motors just swivel... so yeah FAIL!other things that i cannot say as they are spoilers but this movie was just made for the money, written for the money etc.. But it is still a good movie to watch when you want action, drama and thrills.",Oblivion

However, watching this movie, one cant help but feel a sense of dejavu. You have seen it all before. Its kind of amalgamation of great science fiction classics. Maybe the director was giving an intentional nod to some of them. There are even some obvious plot holes. At no point in the movie are you really rooting for one side as the two sides become clear only at the end when the outcome is a forgone conclusion. Overall an enjoyable movie filled with some twists at the end though it lacked the novelty and wow factor thereby, failing to really engross or immerse you.",Oblivion

The visual effects were mind blowing and they seems so real. Its more appealing in the big screen.The way movie starts makes you to fit inside their world straightaway without too much of explanations. There were lots of twists in the tale. When you think that you've predicted the next moment than you'll be surprised cauz its not what it's gonna be. The only thing that stinks in the movie is that its lengthy. You'll get a feeling of 'Come on already' , but you'll regret that when the movie ends. The climax is worth the whole movie, its so cool and new.Cruise and Morgan took the movie in their shoulders , its completely a cruise show. The less you know about the movie the more you'll enjoy. Don't read the spoilers.This one surely surprise you. You'll like it. Recommended for all (not only for sci-fi lovers cauz i am not).",Oblivion
576,jpfloydster,spectacular visuals but story is weak,6,21 December 2013,"Although I enjoyed Oblivion there were moments where I found myself beginning to lull. I certainly am not knocking the film for it's obvious nods and similarities to other sci-fi because there's nothing wrong with that but it never really is able to wow or fully grasp my attention. I really enjoyed the first part of the movie where you are initially introduced to the character and the setting. This kind of apocalyptic setting is one of my favorites and it really shines in this film. Unfortunately there's never any draw towards the character and in my opinion Cruise was lackluster. He seemed very forced throughout the film and unnatural. Much like reading a Stephen King novel (especially It) as soon as I discovered what the aliens were (humans) it was a dull moment, not to mention the fact that if you see a trailer for a movie you can guess what's going to happen. They really tried to throw in as much as they could, what with clones, droids, etc. Nothing just ever seemed to hold any weight. I was expecting an epic battle of thousands of Tom Cruises being sent to destroy the human resistance but instead the evil entity sent two drones. That for me was a let down, I certainly expected a big bang of a battle but was underwhelmed. I enjoyed seeing Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau but his character was so underdeveloped, he was just a familiar face. The story overall took a lot from other films but never gave the audience anything to hold onto. There's certainly a homage to Hal 9000 but didn't give me the eerie feeling as a Space Odyssey did. All in all I thought the movie was an enjoyable one time experience and that's all it needed to be. It wasn't able to hold the atmosphere for the entire movie, only the beginning. Here's my biggest beef with the film; the ending. Tom Cruise flies into the evil triangle up in space with a nuke set to destroy it and put an end to the drones so humanity and repopulate Earth. The main issue here is from the beginning of the movie to the end-ish, the drones scan everything to tell if they're a threat or friend. Not here, not after Tom Cruise had defied Tet (Hal 9000) and just let him stroll on through with a nuke. Oh, and Morgan Freeman. Apparently they didn't want to check that the passenger he had with him was his wife but instead it was Morgan Freeman with a nuke. Whereas earlier in the film the drones could even pick up his DNA particles in the air but they can't tell the difference between a white lady and a black man. It just didn't add up for me. Why would this super being even care about the survivor in the first place when it had just blasted them before. It seemed like an easy cop out. Then it goes back to earth and one of his clones meets up with his wife who apparently gave birth on her own and he intends to fill in as the father/husband role. I imagine it will be really awkward when they find the other 998 Tom Cruise's scouring the planet, maybe they'll take turns being the father/husband. Who knows!",Oblivion

The problem lies exclusively in the acting and writing of this movie, the pacing wasn't even that bad, but the twist about who the villain is, and what the master plan is, makes no sense. The first part of the movie makes for interesting world-building, then everything is thrown out of the board.the ending is particularly bad, overall if you want to watch the good version of the main plot of this movie go watch MOON.",Oblivion

The lighting/physics of the CGI was terrible.The canyon scene was way too similar to Star Wars and ""Sally"" is a weird southern ripoff of Hal 9000.Script/acting: terrible.I don't mind long movies but a cheap sci-fi blockbuster with no character development has no business being so long.It took me 3 nights and sheer determination to get through this.",Oblivion

582,phoneeko,"Beautifully shot, never boring, but...",7,1 May 2013,"Excellent cinematography, if maybe a bit too much on the ""euro"" style (instead of the over saturated colors we see lately). Story is good, but it tries too hard to present you with shocks and twists that can either be seen a mile away or are not significant enough to bring anything interesting to the movie as a whole. Tom cruise is solid as usual, and the rest of the cast supports him accordingly, althou talents like Morgan Freeman and Nicolas Koster Waldau are largely underwritten and underused. Sadly the script sometimes seems borrowed, and as a result the movie reminds you of so many other science fiction movies that it looses its own identity to an otherwise decent reimagining of a ""post- disaster"" future earth. I did enjoy the movie, it is by no means a waste of your time and/or money, it only leaves that idea in your mind that by tweaking it a little more, or maybe even by shortening it and pacing it a little bit faster, a much stronger movie could have emerged. Anyhow, i'm hoping to see Joseph Kocinsky's next directorial effort as soon as possible (TR30N?), I'm becoming a fan pretty fast.",Oblivion

I know he gets paid roughly a billion per word, but wouldn't part of being extremely wealthy mean not having to do the same stupid thing over and over and over? At least Cameron plays with submarines! But we need to realize that as a Scientologist Cruise probably believes some part of all this crap to be FACTUAL, so maybe it's like ""scripture"" to him.Just why are all future fonts slightly squarish? Since they appear in everything ""futury"", they must be superior, so why don't we just give in and use them for everything now? I guess the answer must like in the predictable lack of imagination in the designers of these films.This movie was too long by at least half, but I don't think even the needed slash-and-burn editing this movie required would have made it interesting.And for the last time, NO that speckly-face old black actor guy doesn't automatically add ""gravitas""--not even to Sprint commercials!

The plot contained a couple of well managed twists without spending the entire movie playing the 'can you guess the plot twist' game with over used hints. For the world the story presents, the plot lines did not seem to have and horrible contradictions and the flow was simple enough to follow. The characters were presented and developed well. You felt comfortable with them and felt for them during their challenges in the story. I did find an element of confusion rectifying the elements surrounding Tom C's interactions with the 'aliens' when they tried to capture him and what you find out about them later in the story. Most of those elements are explained away later in the story but there are elements I thought did not fit.I recommend the movie. It was simple and fun.",Oblivion
585,lauluisa,A visually stunning treat,9,13 April 2013,"Having watched the first 20 minutes or so of the film I found myself longing for more just-visual-no-action sequences. Come to think of it, I had the same longing while watching Avatar, Moon, Prometheus, Minority Report and countless other visually rich films. Yes, there was that storm scene within those first 20 minutes, which wasn't necessary (although credible for setting the scene: same old, same old, getting to work in the morning and there's traffic jam on the expressway), but the rest was just enjoyable. Tom Cruise was excellent. Although I'm not a fan I have to admit that he is great in some films. Andrea Riseborough was simply ethereal: I found myself staring, trying to establish whether she was real or digital. And then the drones appear and start shooting and chasing and it all falls to pieces in a blur of explosions and fireworks. Don't get me wrong, I do love me some action, but the shooting and fighting in Matrix is quite enough to last for decades. So I have to respectfully disagree with reviewers who found the beginning too slow and the overall film too long. I would love to have two versions of the film: one in which there could be even more action and another where one could simply immerse oneself onto the barren wasteland of the future and have enough time to really devour all the details. In fact, I wish there were two versions of all of the above-mentioned films. You cannot see details in action and the outcome is predictable anyway, but if you have really seen the details already in the no-action version, then you will be able to recognise and notice those details during the action as well. I think the film was excellent. Yes, there were many parallels with many other films - Island, Total Recall, Impostor and Moon, to mention but a few -, but I think that at this point it is unavoidable. How many original approaches can we possibly have? Aliens - humanoid or not-so-humanoid. Ships - rocket-shaped, round, rectangular, triangular. Alternate timeline - good or not-so-good. Etc. For example, I was a bit let down when the other tech fixing the drone turned out to be another Jack. But then I asked myself, what would have been better? A Jack from a parallel universe? His son caught in a time warp? Perhaps cloning has become as archetypically disturbing to a modern human being, as darkness and spiders? When Ripley found her predeceding siblings in Alien, it was truly disturbing. As it was for Sam in Moon. As for Jack - he had no memories from before, but he considered himself to be an individual - it was excruciating. So, all in all, it was a very enjoyable and even thought-provoking film - not a complete disaster like Prometheus. I only wish the ending would have been different: Julia and her (and Jack's?) child - how'd that happen? And Julia happily accepting another Jack - who, if I'm not mistaken, had no memories of having impregnated Julia? From a practical point of view it would definitely be prudent to have a pile of Jacks in store - just in case. But from an emotional perspective this seems a rather fatal lapse from plausible story-telling. To conclude: if you are a SF fan you cannot afford to miss Oblivion. As for me - I'll definitely watch it again.",Oblivion

587,senderik,Nice way to spend and afternoon but not earth shattering,6,21 April 2013,"This movie reportedly cost around 120 million. I assume that most of that was spent on the salaries Cruise and Freeman because as good as the effects were, in this day and age of PS3 and Xbox, let alone the next gen of PC games, it is almost impossible to distinguish between what is real and what is virtual. Too bad it wasn't spend making the set a bit more convincing or the story more original. Sure the Earth was devastated but did it have to be so total that only a few landmarks were left? The use of deserts always reeks of budget cuts. The design of the ""chopper"" and especially the drones wasn't as inspired as some people make it believe either. The drones could have come out of Portal and the chopper was apparently the last product Apple built before the Moon was blown up. Speaking of the shattered moon, that really looked like a painted matte. There even appeared some fire or magma which is hard to believe seeing the Moon is dead. The story had some nice twists which were pioneered in the Matrix and the end came straight out of Star Wars and Independence Day. All in all, if it wasn't for Cruise and Freeman, this movie probably would have been straight to BluRay instead of the blockbuster it undoubtedly will become.",Oblivion
588,britto-charles,Oblivion - Love Story 2077,7,12 October 2013,"Oblivion is the second feature for Joseph Kosinski which is an adaptation of his unpublished graphic novel of the same name. Set in the remains of the earth after a nuke war by the aliens, Jack Harper(Cruise) a tech and his partner Victoria(Andrea Riseborough) work as an effective team to take care of the drones, hydro-generators and to attack rogue aliens who are called Scavs.Set in the year 2077, Jack is a tech guy who's the last man on earth stationed along with Victoria. The rest of the humans are in Saturn's largest moon Titan and the story majorly happens in the final two weeks before Jack and Victoria return to their station TET before abandoning the earth. TET is their ultimate command center which monitors Jack and Victoria who in turn monitor the hydro-generators which draws energy to be used as fuel for Titan.The story takes a contortion when Jack meets Olga whom he rescues from the wreckage of a space shuttle Odyssey. Jack happening to be the only person who has faint memories of the earth before war and Olga triggers back the memories. Jack and Olga are being captured by the Rogue aliens who are actually humans in disguise and Jack joins them to save what's remaining of the earth.Tom's character as Jack has been built up well and he's adorable in every frame which he appears, specially when he enacts the Superbowl which happens in 2017. Jack's a NY Yankee's fan, that's what I inferred from his cap. He has a bubble ship which looks like a dragonfly made out of glass, the ship has a bobble head on its dash and its the only way for him to vent out. He rides a kind of dirt bike, he has a plant grown out of a tin can. He sets out into the woods and listens to music. He has a collection of books and reads out from The Lays of ancient Rome by Lord Macaulay. He quotes from the poem ""Then out spake brave Horatius, the Captain of the Gate: To every man upon this earth, Death cometh soon or late"".Andrea as Victoria fairs well as a visually appealing colleague of Jack, She shares the bed with him and they swim together but the lady is the one who gives all the command. She's a robot like woman who goes by the commands. Victoria has an aurally alluring British accent that one would forget that there's a Morgan Freeman in this movie. Olga Kurylenko as Julia is namesake role who plays the wife of Jack, whenever she smiles she kind of reminds Lara Dutta. Morgan Freeman, Nilolaj Coaster-Waldau and Zoë Bell are there only to fill up the cast and they aren't even worthy of the supporting cast.The script originally written by Joseph Kosinski and William Monahan , rewritten by Karl Gajudesk and was finally rewritten by Michael Arndt. With so many drafts written by academy award winners the script fails in many parts and seems to be a long boring Sci-Fi towards the end. At places it even reminds you of other Sci-Fi movies, but Kosinski stated that Oblivion is a tribute to all Sci-Fi movie of 1970's.Guess he thought its better to be told before to be found out. It was actually a beautiful love triangle story which was later ruined by action scenes only because its a Sci-Fi movie and dollops of action scenes are highly required. The ""Waking Up"" soundtrack by M23 is very Hans Zimmerish and if you close your eyes and listen you'll mistake it for a Chris Nolan movie.On the whole Oblivion works out well for major portion of the movie. Its certainly to be watched on an IMAX screen to savor the visual spectacle and at the same time one should be happy that it wasn't released in 3-D as a considerable amount of your money is saved. Oblivion tag-lined as ""Earth's a memory worth fighting for"" is a movie worth watching for Tom Cruise fan-boys.",Oblivion
589,andy-barbieri,'Oblivion',9,24 April 2013,"I love my science fiction, and 'Oblivion' felt like a homage to my favourite genre, taking it's recognisable themes from the world of sci- fi. It was also a stunning looking film. From the design (the bubblecraft and drones for example) and the visuals (cinematography was by Claudio Miranda, who won Oscars for his work on 'Life Of Pi' and 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button') and the barren landscapes of a war torn Earth. If ever there was a gorgeous looking film, then this is it!I also enjoyed director Joseph Kosinski's first film, 'Tron: Legacy', and 'Oblivion' seems to continue his style of gorgeously shot films, and I certainly look forward to more from this director.The story itself, which is based on an unpublished graphic novel by Kosinski (an illustrated novel will hopefully be released), and without giving too much of things away, has Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), and his by-the-book assistant Vika (Andrea Riseborough) assigned to Earth, its surface devastated after decades of war with the alien Scavs, to repair the damaged drones that scan the planet surface. When Jack discovers a crashed spacecraft, it's contents bring into question everything he believed about the war, and may even put the fate of mankind in his hands. The trailers don't give too much away, for a change, and although towards the end it becomes a bit of a sci-fi mixtape with familiar tropes from some of my favourite sci-fi films, it's still a very enjoyable ride! The soundtrack by Anthony Gonzalez of M83 and Joseph Trapanese is one of the highlights of the film and very haunting. I've been listening to the score leading up to watching the movie, it's very good as a standalone piece and it does work especially well within the film. It did remind me at times of Daft Punk's score from 'Tron:Legacy' and 'Blade Runner' by Vangelis, which is no bad thing at all!If you go in expecting a full on action sci-fi with aliens etc, like the trailers may have presented then you may come out of the cinema disappointed. But, if you're after a bit of quality in the same vein as 'Moon' and love science fiction, like I do, then you will enjoy 'Oblivion'. I can't wait for the blu!",Oblivion

Moon and 2001 are amongst my favourites so I was put off watching this initially by reading the reviews and the negative comparisons to these. Now I have seen it I can see why it draws these comparisons.I am pleased that i watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Oblivion is a solid modern sci-fi with a lot of positives.the special effects are fantastic, the acting is good (providing you can attribute the soulless performances to clone lack of personality/memory), its has an 80's feel with the way it is shot which makes it seem different. It is slick.One important point to remember if you want to enjoy it is that this is a Hollywood sci-fi, it's not clever or particularly original, there are numerous plot holes that you could point to and there are many clichéd themes. You have seen this film before or at least most of the concepts in it.

Strange events occur with Jack (Tom Cruise) and it then triggers him to ask himself how much exactly does he know about his employers and his mission.Now a run through the acting performances, Tom Cruise was excellent as always, he seemed to carry the movie through the...how do I say it; already used story line, but I'll get to that later. There's Olga Kurylenko (Julia) who, in every movie I see with her in it, she is the mysterious girl who the main character always falls in love with. Morgan Freeman (Beech) needs no introduction and pulled off a very nice performance, despite is fairly small role/screen time. You can't forget Andrea Riseborough (Victoria) who showed a good performance, I can't say it was excellent though.The story, I really don't want to spoil anything but I'm sure the message board has had many many threads saying the exact same thing as I am thinking. I will just say there is a significant movie rated 8.0 and features Sam Rockwell in it, which follows a very, if not, too similar story line to Oblivion, however I'm here to review Oblivion, not... the other one.Oblivion is a fun movie with different genres colliding, including romances, mystery and action/thriller.

592,yaldish,"Could have been a step forward - 6,5/10",6,12 April 2013,"Before I say anthing, I just want to go on record and say that I haven't read the graphic novel.I saw the movie 'Oblivion' on IMAX (My first time). I was stunned by the visuals and production design that this movie had, it reminded me how good the Sci-Fi genre is. I've always been a fan of Tom Cruise, and never really understood the hate against him as an actor. In other words, I had no problem with him or any other person in the cast. The main problem with this film was the score/soundtrack, believe it or not.The soundtracks sucked up all life from the movie and at the same time tried to give it life. Here we have a movie about a post-apocalyptic earth, stunning visual effects, amazing cinematography, great production design and good actors. Now, that in it self is already epic. You don't need a score that sounds like badly composed Hans Zimmer score for 'The dark knight rises' (which it did) to make the picture more epic. And that was the main problem with the movie. If the movie had been more silent - meaning that the only thing you would hear would be the spaceships, guns etc, and less music - the movie would have been more raw and would have given a sign of ""no hope"" in it. You can't have a post-apocalyptic world with ""epic"" music that sounds like Hans Zimmer during the entire movie, and I'm not kidding when I say the entire movie. It also sucked out all life from the characters, meaning that when 'Jack' was sad, the music was extra-super-epic-sad, so you couldn't really focus on any of the acting in itself, the music did it for you. As a matter of fact, when the movie started, I wasn't quite sure if it was a trailer or if the movie really started - because of the music.I didn't have any problem with the length of the movie, there were some amazing things in it which needed time. There was a scene in which 'Jack' floated around in the spaceship near the end which I thought was just amazing. Other than that, it could have been a really great movie.",Oblivion

I feel bad for Jack Harper and his crew. To not be who you think, to not be on the right side and not know it, to be stuck with someone else's memories... and it's quite though provoking to think about the meaning behind these memories and what it means to be someone.

However, the visuals are indeed beautiful - the futuristic white station built atop a mountain, the well-designed swimming pool, the mountain peak where Jack sat on and did things like watering a small flowering plant grown in a can as he looked upon the gigantic hydro rigs and the surrounding landscape.There are a few plot twists, but most of them turned out to be not very interesting when fully revealed. The real identity of the scavengers and the appearance of Jack's look-alike drone maintenance man did surprise me a little, but that's about it.The ending may appear to be slightly rushed, but it would somewhat satisfy those who would like to see a 'complete alien destruction' ending.Reasonably entertaining overall, but I won't recommend that you buy its DVD or Blu-ray disc unless you are totally alright with the perceived lack of character development and average storyline.",Oblivion

That was a mistake. It is one of my favorite movies this year, along with Man of Steel. There is much to like about the movie. Cruise is great, as usual. The story is excellent. I really do not understand how movies like this are considered to be ""unoriginal"". What isn't derivative these days? I really liked the fact that the main twist in the story took me by surprise, and was very satisfying. The visuals are fantastic. The movie had a very ""planet of the apes"" feel, with what seemed like homages paid to that movie. Sure there were a couple of things in the movie which seemed a bit silly, like the motorcycle. And it seems unlikely that the TET can't figure out what Jack is doing.

598,phil1945,"emotionless like a stone, purposeless like watering the lawn during the rain.",5,16 October 2013,"I want to start out by saying that I am a big admirer of the work that Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman have produced during their renowned careers. These two could team up for a NyQuil commercial and I would seriously consider spending three dollars to rent it on DVD, (I am well aware that people do not rent commercials on DVD, but you get the picture.) However, not even this powerful duo can make this movie stand-out.I could sit here and talk about the overly simplistic dialog, the tiresome and unoriginal story, the acting, that is adequate at best and the slow pace of this movie, but I think it would be best to express the feeling that this movie creates, rather than listing everything that is wrong with it.Watching Oblivion is a lot like going out on a date with a girl you kind of know, but never really cared for, and have little interest in getting to know. This is the kind of a date from which you do not expect to find a romantic interest or even an enjoyable company. At most, you expect to spend some money, (because you are after all a gentleman,) and pass the time. You don't have anything else going on that evening and you already promised your friend who has been trying to set you up for months. So, you go, and dine and chat and for a brief moment a thought passes by, ""maybe she will be better than I think? Maybe there is something I will learn about her that I will really like. What if my attitude is the problem?"" But after the date is over, you prove to yourself what you already knew. It's her. Of course it's her. If only she wasn't so boring, superficial, dull, completely not funny, entertaining or intellectual, but she is.That girl is Oblivion.Now, I just want to make a clarification, that this negative mindset is a terrible way to go about meeting new people, seeing new movies and living life in general. I do not practice it and do not recommend it to anyone. However I feel that this example perfectly illustrates my attitude towards this movie.The main problem with Oblivion is that it evokes zero emotions. I could not help but feel nothing at all towards this picture. No anger, frustration or disappointment. Obviously any positive emotions were out of the window.Oblivion is futuristic and visually of high-quality, but in a very unexciting kind of a way. There are attempts at action, romance, suspense and purpose in this movie. However, all resemble more of a thought of doing something, instead of actually doing something. The movie is very video game-like, a slow futuristic video game with very few characters and very few things to shoot at. This game is the kind where you need to walk around over barren landscape and try to figure out what happened. At the end of the game you realize that you have played this game before, many times. It just had a different name.A lot of people really seemed to enjoy Oblivion and claim it to be a great science fiction picture. To each his own, but for my money, the movie Prometheus was similar in genre but heads and shoulders above this film.Go-ahead and take this girl out, maybe you'll see something in her that others didn't. Just be grounded in your expectations and don't talk about yourself the entire night.",Oblivion
599,paulappleyard17,Excellent science fiction film,8,9 October 2013,"This is a very well made science fiction film. It has an intelligent plot, fantastic cinematography, great soundtrack and good cast.There are not too many big budget science fiction films like this made these days, and as a science fiction fan I really enjoyed this film.It could have been better, and it's not up there with the likes of 2001 A Space Odyssey. The movie is dynamic, with plenty of action scenes, making it more sci-fi action than pure sci-fi, and that should help it appeal to the masses more. However, the action is consistent with the plot, and very well done.Tom Cruise has starred in yet another very good movie. In an illustrious career the quality of the films he has starred in is remarkable (with the exception of a few of the MI sequels!) This movie deserved to do well, and it did make a healthy profit worldwide. I'm happy about that, because it may encourage Hollywood to treat us to some more big budget sci-fi extravaganzas like this one.Whilst more of a cinematic disaster movie in space than pure sci-fi, I'm also very much looking forward to Gravity!",Oblivion
600,mickyt-towler,Olivion review,10,30 August 2013,"A good science fiction story .Well acted. except for a couple of scenes just minimal actors on the screen you just have to think about the film and the interaction between it main characters Its a love story spanning 60 years with the Earth dying as a back drop I felt sorry for Victoria with her longing for Jack as she says ""it was always her "". The film doesn't rely on a cast of a thousands or constant explosions. As a person who started read SF in 1949 this IS a Science Fiction at its best and how any one can't understand it is beyond me. The Clones were not simple clones as we know it but exact copies which with their memories suppressed which is a another matter. There are always holes in a story somewhere as in like why couldn't the TET put Satellites in orbit for communication but that's just nit picking, also I wonder what happened or will happen to all the other Jack and Victoria Teams which must have been on Earth seeing as the second Jack was no 52, do they survive and Victoria has Jack to herself, food for thought.",Oblivion
601,danrdeneyer,"Not a bad story, but definitely overlong and too many video-game style fights",5,23 February 2015,"An uneven mix of Moon, Star Wars, The Matrix and any post-apocalyptic movie. Cruise stars as usual as the hero of the story (in this case, even multiple hero), a guy named Jack who is watching over planet earth after an alien invasion destroyed the moon.He lives in a wonderful, futuristic villa with a beautiful, stylish, well-dressed woman and commutes by helicopter around the planet to fix sophisticated broken weapons (called ""drones""). Not a bad job or accommodation, if you ask me. Desolate earth looks quite peaceful and not having traffic jams or annoying neighbors looks great. Unfortunately for Jack, dark secrets are lurking around. Jack discovers that things are not quite as he thinks and that perhaps it would have been better if they were.The discovery involves the crash of an ""old"" spacecraft containing mysterious Julia, who is mysteriously related to Jack. After the crash the movie lose steam and it turns into a boring ride involving too many video-game style fights.The end is quite a let-down. Throughout the movie, which is a good 20 minutes too long, I just kept wondering what Jack and co. were eating, since there was no visible sign of agriculture, fishing or any other activity that provides food. And also, where those stylish clothes were coming from",Oblivion
602,basscadet75,Beautiful and vastly underrated - the Tom Cruise factor?,9,26 February 2014,"I'd been wanting to see this ever since the first trailer, but ended up passing on it while it was in theaters. I'd been poisoned by many of the critical reviews and some internet commenters, who called it ""slow"", ""confusing"", ""plodding"", ""derivative"" and just another vanity project for Tom Cruise.I was happy to discover (after finally watching the Blu-Ray release) that it is actually none of those things. What it is is a beautifully shot, thoughtful, complex sci-fi drama the likes of which we're not often treated to in this era of superhero action movies that just want to blow as much stuff up as possible on screen.Oh, but there is action - it's just that those scenes are strangely enough the least interesting. That's probably because the movie's not really about that - in fact, it's *these* scenes that feel drawn out a bit too long. We know the heroes are going to come through, otherwise the movie would end. I just wanted them to get on with it. The main drama is filled with way more twists and turns than any of the action scenes.It's these twists that make the plot interesting - it opens like a puzzle that doesn't quite fit together, but that's intentional. Rather than feeling like the filmmakers slapped a twist on to make for a surprise ending, ""Oblivion"" is built in such a way that you're actually meant to question the status quo right from the first scene. If you've got a curious mind and you're paying attention, you'll wonder about various little things.For example, about 10 minutes in my wife asked ""where did they get the money to build all this beautiful stuff?"" I won't give away any spoilers because finding out the answers is one of the pleasures of this movie - but trust me when I tell you that all your questions, even seemingly insignificant ones like ""how could they afford this?"" *are* answered. It's pretty satisfying how everything starts to fit together as you watch.The movie really is beautiful to look at and it's mostly well paced to allow the wide open, minimalist settings room to breathe. Joseph Kosinski seems to have a real aesthetic of his own (though one that's obviously influenced by Stanley Kubrick). Both ""Tron: Legacy"" and ""Oblivion"" share many aesthetic qualities - one is primarily ""dark"" and the other ""light"", but they're easily recognizable as having been helmed by the same person. I didn't actually know the same guy directed both while watching, but I remember saying ""this feels a lot like Tron"" to my wife while it was on. That's not a criticism - Kosinski's still building his catalog, but the best directors usually have a distinct style through all of their movies, regardless of genre.I really wonder if the problem a lot of people had with this movie is that they can no longer get past Tom Cruise. I'm not a fan of him personally, but I'm able to detach my feelings about him from his characters. I actually think he usually does a good job of making me forget I'm watching Tom Cruise (in other words, I don't think he's a bad actor!) and that was true here too. The acting among the four principals was surprisingly good, and I think I even have a little crush on Olga Kurylenko.The movie does seem to be a comment on the dangers of our increasing reliance on drones. I don't know, maybe that's a topic that's been covered in films before, but I haven't seen it - or at least not like this. I feel like some people didn't get that, or they did but had already made up their mind about the rest of the movie. Let's not forget, though, that a young Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (which itself was a comment on our coming reliance on AI) was heavily criticized on its release for many of the same reasons ""Oblivion"" has been. That's not to put them in the same class, but just to suggest that it's possible for films to overcome initial critic and audience biases over time. Hopefully that happens with ""Oblivion.""",Oblivion
603,horizons-31265,Underrated and beautiful,10,18 November 2020,"If you like dystopic sci-fi movies, you'll love Oblivion. An example of a wide divide between the impression of critics and movie-goers.",Oblivion
604,sergage,Unintelligent and forgettable (minor spoilers ahead),3,17 April 2013,"This movie started out OK. It managed to establish an interesting and mysterious post war-with-aliens Earth, however after 30-40 minutes it started doing laughable things and unfortunately got only worse as it progressed, to a point that I was no longer laughing - I was almost angry.Like I said the first 1/3 of this film is OK, the rest feels like random scenes glued together that perhaps the director saw as necessary ingredients. Most of the time I couldn't tell what was going on, who the characters were and what were their goals and motivations. Not to mention the numerous plot holes, such as: where does the electricity at the lake house come from since the entire planet is in ruins, why did it take 60 years for the capsule to land, who summoned it, how and why, why did it carry the black box from the ship and how was the device able to record after being detached from the main ship? It may sound like I'm nitpicking, but when the film does nothing to keep you engaged, you can't help but notice these little details.Actingwise the film is OK. The cast consists of mostly decent actors (with my only complaint going to Kurylenko's accent going back and forth between English and American). Having said that the characters are not very believable, mostly because they are never fully developed and their lines are in most cases below average. I never really found myself caring about any of the characters in this film. I should also add that even with all the bad dialog being there the film could use a bit more verbal development, because quite on many occasions you expect characters to talk, start asking questions, engage in intense conversations, but they never do, instead they throw blank stares at each other.The plot is underdeveloped. The already flawed story seems to go nowhere and the 5 minute resolution they've put in seemed rushed and unsatisfying. Most of the action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, bringing the quality of the overall film even lower. Also I think the villain could have used more screen time and more complexity to their character and background.The director of this film is Joseph Kosinski, who also directed Tron Legacy, a film I'm not a big fan of. I went to see Oblivion with average to high expectations, but it turned out pretty much exactly like Tron Legacy - uneven, inconsistent, poorly written and overall not well thought out. If you are considering seeing this - don't. Watch something like Moon instead. I give this 3/10 for the not horrible beginning, the interesting gadgetry, the nice sci-fi atmosphere and the overall concept behind the film, which instead could have been made into an awesome first person shooter.",Oblivion
605,luca-annone,Pretty good science fiction after quite some time,7,12 April 2013,"I would say that this movie is somehow a Moon meets Planet of the Apes (with some other elements of known science fiction plots here and there). But overall I thought it was pretty solid, and absolutely amazing in terms of visuals and aesthetics. I loved the design of their futuristic ""safe houses"" and vehicles. And the depiction of this post apocaliptic world is amazing.The actors are all good, despite a pathetic Morgan Freeman. I have to say, he seems to be repeating himself over and over. The ""rhythm"" of the movie is paced really well. Just at the end maybe it got a little long. But no useless action scenes or stuff alike. So, thanks for that. Unfortunately, I usually find it easier to criticize a movie... But I had to post a positive comment after the (in my opinion) unjustified bad reviews I read here on IMDb. Being myself pretty unforgiving when it comes to this genre. But considering the garbage I saw lately (including Prometheus), this is definitely something a fan of science fiction should see. If I really had to criticize something, I would just say that lately there are too many movies on the end of the world, that give a pessimistic view of the future. And this movie follows this trend. It seems they are suggesting that, to overcome the current difficulties humanity is facing, the easiest solution would be to wipe everything out, hoping that the survivors would do a better job (and some countries tried it already but it didn't really work that well...).Anyway, I give it a full 7/10 (in my scale, good and could watch it again). I would strongly recommend it to anyone that likes science fiction and was waiting for something new worth watching.",Oblivion

Very good original score and spectacular shots are what makes this movie good in my opinion. The all so familiar stories that i see in it almost unchanged and poorly ""glued"" are what makes it bad. This movie has, very explicitly, references to and mainly: ""Moon"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""The Matrix"" and a touch of ""Independence Day"". It's a far too long movie that becomes only bearable by the amazing scenes very similar to the imagery of ""Tron Legacy"" justifying alone Joseph Kosinskis participation on this project. In sum this movie has a spectacular image and a good score that pull the weight being created by the lack of originality and constant reminder that this movie is imitating some very good movies without adding anything to improve them.",Oblivion
608,craterofstink,Watch Moon instead. Same twist done 4 years earlier.,5,28 August 2013,"While certainly derivative of many science fiction classics, Oblivion is also a visually stunning experience worthwhile because it puts ideas in place that make you think and isn't just a visual effects spectacle with wall to wall action. The best moments of this adventure are the spare moments of discovery rather than the impressive action scenes. The story makes you think and keep you on your toes the whole time and even though there's small plot holes here and there that I wish were explained better, they didn't completely destroy the experience like they can with other movies in this genre. The movie slowly reveals its secrets over the lengthy 2 hour run time and there's spots where it could have used better pacing, but overall it does a decent job in that department. Tom Cruise gives a solid performance well within his wheelhouse he is known for while Morgan Freeman is in the movie very little despite getting significant screen time in trailers and commercials. Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough also give effective performances as the female interests in the story. Oblivion is not going to spoke in the same breath as the classics it clearly emulates, but its thoughtful and unique world is worthwhile for someone wanting a little brain with their science fiction spectacle.",Oblivion

The scenes of the surroundings are breathtaking, CGI are the top of game, camera and light are astounding and thats about it. The story is bad it has plot holes. Tom Cruise has done pretty good job, but the problem is story. Pointless ending, too many borrowed element from recent sci fi movies. You just stop caring for the actors after 50 minutes of the movie. Morgan Freeman shows up for 10 minutes, and his character is sooo badly written. Ending is predictable and then it becomes very cheesy. I know this is the sci fi movie but why did mother machine had to have humans to repair her machines that it built, I really don't get it, and why it looks like big HAL ?

611,briansouter,SPOILERS: Deception or Things are not what they seem in film on Drone warfare,9,16 April 2013,"In Oblivion, Americans in particular get to see drones up close, in a manner only seen by their middleeast victims. I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, and still have my queries. The title is suggestive but its meaning in 'forgetting', is not clear till later on. For the first half, life for our hero is simple. Jack Harper is a drone serviceman,who likes superbowl and longs to go to the remaining human colony on Titan,has an idyllic hermitage, with some very old books. He wants to go and wants to remain: Jack is a man divided.But still has work to do on a shattered Earth. He has a team companion, a British woman Victoria who always stays behind monitoring his mission,a sort of mission controller. The only other human we see at first is a woman Sally, a mission controller(for real as we learn) who is supposed to be in the big upside down pyramidal thingy floating above the earth, where other humans are. The drones he services are for the protection of huge vacuum cleaners sucking up earths oceans for fusion power for humans on Titan, we are told. Also to kill any lurking alien menace (what else are drones good for?) Jack likes to take his bubble ship and traverse the remains of earth. He finds a downed drone and we learn he isbeing observed by unknown but likely sinister beings.Here the film is a thriller. Monsters lurk in the dark, threateningly, out of view: its suggested they are the same aliens who destroyed the moon. (Thank god for the drones!) A trip to an underground place where lurk sinister figures who almost kill Jack, but for a drone (god bless em) which comes to his rescue. He is cleared by it and it terminates whatever lurking fiends were present. Things go swimmingly for jack and his lovely team mate (who he ties to please by bringing back a plant(flowers?), which she drops over the side of their house (no potentially toxic plants please, were British): they as we are reminded: 'an effective team', tho he does have these dreams of an unknown woman, and a intact NY. Flies off to an idyll he seems to have made, Till one day a ship careers into the atmosphere and Jack goes to investigate. Finds a human cargo in sleep pods, one woman he is able to rescue but the rest are killed by the drones: an event which alarms Jack. The woman is the woman in his dreams, From here the film slowly turns into a 'reality is not what you think it is' vehicle, as we learn the sinister shadowy figures are the real surviving humans, the drones are really alien kill machines 'terminating' what is left of humanity, and Jack and Victoria are clones. The bad guys are really good guys and vice versa, drones are not there to defend humanity,things are not what they seem, and Jack and Vicky, the now not so effective team are clone pawns serving the alien invaders stealing our earths precious bodily fluids(sorry!) and servicing the machines sent to kill any surviving humanity. Nice! Pananoia never looked so good! For Jack and us, the is advised by advised by god...sorry Morgan Freemans character to enter the radiation zone, which he does ...the truth really is out there! Jack and we the audience suddenly have our take on things turned upside down....or rightside up. If truth lies in Knowing Thyself, Jack gets a real education! This is a well made film showing further advances in film technology and i feared it was all about that and nothing else....but surprisingly it does force the viewer to review the ideas he has been fed by the Sallys of the apocalyptic military media industrial complex...are drones good? are they saving humanity orhave we all been deceived. Its interesting that American jack has a British partner servicing the drones...nudge nudge wink wink.But its not till after Jack enters the Forbidden zone, a finds its another area serviced by an identical Jack Harper and Vicky, that this theme is itself inverted. For Jack Vicky and Julia were part of a mission to destroy the pyramid. Its curious that Julia has a Russian(or Ukrainian) name! A desire to see US and Russia make amends? to become a really effective team. The 'are you an effective team' question 'Sally' asks of British Vicky, can be asked of the current UK/US imperial alliance: add France and you have FUKUS,currently waging war in Africa and middle east...just like the never seen aliens. In politics as in the film, things ain't what they seem to be. It will be interesting to see how Americans in particular see this film.",Oblivion

I am sure the final explosion in the sky was taken from ""Independance Day"" and this just about sums up the film. Bits and pieces from lots of different sci- fi films pieced together with some good cinematography. I now realise why Tom could'nt explain the film when appearing on the Graham Norton Show last week. It's really just a Cruise vehicle and he just isn't an actor of depth and quality to carry this off. On the other hand what a revelation Andrea Riseborough is, fabulous acting. Morgan Freeman plays his normal President/God/Leader of Humanity- (tick the appropriate box part). But overall only a so- so movie.

614,Bwohahaha,"A Rewarding, Visually stunning Sci-fi",8,28 October 2014,"Well, as it is said, you can't always trust a movie on its review. Review to a movie is supposed to be praising its goodness and integrity and also evaluating for its defects and faults. But some folks won't take the risks of spending time on watching the movie in order to give an honest review. Instead takes the shortcuts of imitating and copying others, end up degrading the film. Wherein reality, the facts will be just the opposite of their hideous statements. For me, the movie Oblivion felt like such a victim of false criticism. Movie reviewing sites like 'Rotten Tomatoes' brands Oblivion really rotten. Well, I would say, it's not the movie that's 'rotten' here but it's the review that's rotten obviously.Oblivion is based on the graphic novels of Joseph Kosinki who himself directs the sci-fi, action-adventure flick. Though his previous visionary and technically rich Tron: Legacy (2010) was acclaimed for its visual treatment, Oblivion is far superior to its predecessor on technical and visual features. It's gorgeously designed and mind blending and striking in graphics. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic earth which is destroyed by the invasion of some kind of aliens, 'The Scaves' as the film refers to it. The opening narration says initially it was not by the action of aliens that the earth was destroyed but was because of the humans own actions to win the war against the extra-terrestrials. ""We had to nuke 'em"" and leave the earth hard to inhabit because of the hazardous radiations aftermath produced. With a devastated earth and partially obliterated moon, the humans are forced to shift their habitat to Titan, the moon of Saturn.Tom cruise as the Commander Jack Harper, a repairman who fixes anti- alien drones on earth, offers an exuberant performance. Other prominent casts include Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko and Andrea Riseborough. The movie is primarily condemned for its lack of story (I don't know why they say it but the story is indeed intriguing), despite its praise of visually striking originality. The plot is above average for the subject it speaks, giving importance both to the characters and theme. But it occasionally fails to connect between the story and bringing out effective sentiments. Also feels a bit lagging during the half time but takes it pace and momentum in the third quarter. It does bring some unexpected twists which are OK, but overall succeeds in the attempt to show some reasonable climax. The film speaks about aspects of alienation, colonialism, apocalypse, war and scientific themes like technology, the future life and infinitesimal mentions to human cloning, dystopian and cyberpunk genre.Overall Oblivion is an enthusiastic fiction worth watching. Great graphics and visuals, beautifully designed and architects. Will be a treat to the fans of Tom cruise and the genre. But in the end, like everything it's subjective. It depends upon the person's tastes and perceptions. For me, it's a worth watching movie.",Oblivion

Well you are not entirely wrong. The acting here is very decent. Somehow, i really hoped Morgan Freeman has more acting time in this.Even though so, it is still a good movie. Keyword, GOOD. I don't use that word often, however i really think this movie deserves a thumbs up. This is because all the questions are not left unanswered in this movie, in which is a big plus point for me.The twists in the story does not confuse the audience, moreover annoys them. The acting however is rather annoying, especially Olga Kurylenko. Andrea Riseborough brought out a great performance (thank god) and surprisingly i wasn't enjoying tom cruise's acting.

617,alexxchiodo,"Similar to 'The Island', just not as good",7,3 November 2013,"Okay, I'm going to be as concise as I can.. 'Oblivion' had really high potential when i first heard about its release, yet i don't think it was completely 'finessed' in its execution. Firstly, I really liked the movie's portrayal of creating a futuristic post-apocalyptic world which I thought looked really striking and impressive. Also, I didn't see the revelation coming when Jack discovers that Julia is his wife, there is no civilization on Titan and that Jack is a mere pawn, of many pawns being ""bred"" to supervise the extraction of Earth's remaining resources and repair drones. However that's all i can really recall that surprised or impressed me.From a critical perspective, I didn't feel like I could really relate to any of the characters in the film, not even the protagonist Jack, which isn't very satisfying as the viewer. In addition, I didn't feel like Beech and the survivors got enough screen-time to really make me feel some sort of attachment to their characters. For example, I didn't feel sympathetic when the drones attacked the survivors' base and nearly wiped everybody out, which I got the sense that I was meant to feel some sort of sympathy there, but because I didn't get to see much of Beech or his group I couldn't force myself to feel this way. Similarly, when Jack and Beech destroy the Tet (the massive space station) at the end of the film, I didn't really feel fulfilled or reverent for the characters. I mean I understand they had to do what they had to do but if the film just spent more time developing their characters further I would have felt more satisfied with the ending. This leads me to recapitulate that there wasn't all that much character development by the end of the film; none of the characters changed much from the beginning of the movie. It just felt like an apocalyptic-adaption of the movie 'The Island' when you discover that Jack and Victoria are clones, just 'Oblivion' wasn't as good. I didn't feel any sentimental connection with the characters, and i think that if they had dedicated more time with dialogue between the characters for growth the movie would have been more potent.In conclusion though, the movie wasn't horrible, yet it wasn't amazing. It has its pros and cons but for every pro, there are two cons, which held the movie back. It's worth watching but there's no need for haste.",Oblivion

And since I advised you to stay away from those, I feel like it's my duty to tell you what you need to know about the film before going into it. Here we go. Earth got invaded by aliens, we won the war by ruining it with nukes and now we are getting ready to leave it and Tom Cruise's character Jack Harper, who is one of the last few people still on Earth, is tasked with defending the final stages of preparation of our departure.

Very briefly that's all you need to know.This movie does have a slow build-up, introducing you to our two main characters of Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough, followed by a mind-blowingly beautiful reveal of the world they live in and their job in it. Immediately you can tell that something is not right in this world, that there is something greater going on and I adored this aspect of the film. You also get to see some cool action sequences that mainly introduce you to the so called scaves, the renegades of an alien army that attacked us.Now it's time to talk about by far the best thing about this film. Cinematography and visual effects. They. Are. Mesmerizing. The gorgeous desolate wasteland in an awe-inspiring wide shots (often notably shot in camera) and completely seamless CGI make Oblivion one of the most beautifully looking films I have seen in my life. Let me emphasize this... CGI is completely seamless. There are so many instances where I just can't tell if what I'm seeing is real or visual effects. When the CGI is so good that you can't tell that it's CGI, that is praise-worthy. There is always that one shot that makes you go ""oh, that's CGI"". There is not a shot that is even remotely close to that in Oblivion. Same goes to Cladio Miranda, once again proving that he is one of the best cinematographers we have.The structure of the story is so that you can learn and discover new things about the past and the events taking place prior to the world's desolation through flashbacks and this is where we get to my one very slight problem with the film. Though these flashbacks are very meaningful, they sometimes take you by surprise, often during a sequence that you were already really sucked in. But they by no mean break the immersion or hinder the storytelling, is just that they often happen when you didn't expect them. This is the only reason this film doesn't get 10 out of 10.Also, if you ever feel that other characters besides Tom Cruise are kind of underdeveloped just wait until the grand reveal that wonderfully concludes the film, while leaving a good number of thing ambiguous.Oh, and yeah, the score for the film from M83, huuuhhh... wow.Overall I adored this film, it's one of the best looking film I've seen, pristinely directed, well acted, mind bending, meaningful... and it leaves us wondering what will be the next visual treat we get from Joseph Kosinski.",Oblivion

I see a lot of people saying, ""Watch the movie Moon instead."" Huh? That movie was horrible...imo. And what does it have to do with Oblivion? Nada. Don't watch Oblivion to compare, watch it to relax and enjoy. It's not an action flick, it's a decent story, beautiful CGI and stunning scenery, with a couple action sequences thrown in. If you liked movies such as ""Book of Eli"", ""Bicentennial Man"" or films of that nature, you're sure to enjoy Oblivion as it moves at that general pace. So kick back, relax and take it all in. I'm sure you'll be happy you did. I could watch it repeatedly...and have.",Oblivion
620,khono,Simplistic and Common,5,17 April 2013,"The major plot twists in this movie, as well as most of the plot, is standard fare in science fiction and has been for decades. The only impressive thing in this movie is the visuals.The world depicted is stark with cardboard characters who act predictably and feel hollow. While some of this is certainly intentional based on the theme, the rest are due to careless writing using the science fiction successes of the past to cookie-cut another one out.Even the technology seen in this movie is very limited and reminiscent of the low detail props seen from much lower budget science fiction.Science fiction buffs who are capable of enjoying the sights and sounds despite the simple and commonplace plot should find the movie watchable. Those of you who aren't big science fiction fans probably won't notice the difference so you'd probably enjoy the movie. The plot is about as thrilling as an average episode from the Star Trek franchise, but with better visuals and more famous actors.Considering the $120 million budget, I'd've thought they could have done a better job. But I suppose James Cameron, as well as professional science fiction authors, have raised the bar.",Oblivion

622,ballound,"Oblivion, a movie to forget.",3,16 April 2013,"I was very excited about this title. The teaser was just perfect. I mean, come on, you see Morgan Freeman's face on the light of a mist asking you ""Do you want to know the truth?"" with his Morgan Freeman voice, you can't just say no to that. Plus Tom Cruise has involved himself into awesome Sci-fi titles such as Minority Report, this was promising. I knew it was the same guy who remade Tron who did this, but I thought maybe he had learned from his mistakes and did something good here. Sadly, the teaser was much better that the movie itself.The film is extremely anti-climatic. It is almost an insult to the Sci-fi genre. I have to admit that the kinematics are well executed. The tension and suspense is also well executed. The acting is top notch. The plot is awful and the ""moral of the story"" is non-existent cliché-like garbage.This movie is a major disappointment. It doesn't bare any opinion. It is not entertaining and it is not a deep thought experiment either. It is just pictures and sound. I'm really disappointed, and so will be you if you, like me, expect this to be the awesome movie it could have been.What is a good movie for me, you might ask. Well a movie where I can ask ""What was the point?"" at the end and answer. This movie has no point. Maybe some little thoughts in the first half, known ideas, and that's all.***SPOILERS COME FROM NOW ON*** I feel that I have to justify why am I so harsh. It's been a while since I haven't seen a good Sci-fi movie, and I'm sad to see how this attempt was ruined by god knows what.The plot just leads to nowhere. The premise gets ruined by every plot turn. I still had hope that in the end, I had hope that in the last minute they would tell me what was the point of the movie, what were the author trying to tell the world with this... but no.I recovered hope when that alien thing let Cruise in when he told the truth. That alien thing is either retarded or too smart, I was thinking, ""yes, this is the moment when we have the major conversation that explains the film"". But no! Wow!! The robot-alien-whatever doesn't say anything, it is neither wise nor stupid nor... it just shouts I'M YOUR GOD, GTFO and Cruise is like ""screw you"" and blows everything up. 2 hours I waited to see how would the author of this piece use aliens to analyze mankind or to analyze life or to anything at all, but no. Just blow up the bloody place. And they they had sex and had children and the end. How primitive is that? I left the theater disappointed and tricked once again. When will there be a good Sci-fi blockbuster again? My hope won't die. Don't waste your time on this tho.

I lost hours of my life today watching this romantic movie disguised as a sci-fi movie! Not good at all! Not!I guess the director wanted to create some kind of ideology kind of movie by bringing hope to a sad world and by pointing out the ""Destiny"" fact but first of, you get bored. You have the same music at each scene, scenes are extremely slow... besides 2-3 action scenes, there isn't anything going on. I really had this feeling of watching a documentary on a full HD channel and nothing more.... oh maybe a documentary promoting the Scientology. Wonder why Cruise was in it...

624,VideoMasher3000,"I am glad I watched it, but I have seen much better.",6,7 January 2014,"This was a decent film to say the least, but I have to say I wasn't overly impressed. First I would like to say that the graphics for this film was pretty nice. The technology in this movie seemed like it would be something you would actually see within the next hundred years so I give it props for some decent realism. Besides that and some amusing action scenes along with pretty good acting from Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, there was a lot of this movie that was not only boring, but also frustrating. The only Character that we got any real back story on was the main protagonist Jack, giving us some flashbacks here and there but not a whole lot to go off of. his female counterpart Julia is annoying and no one was sad when she got killed. The second female lead being the survivor of a crashed ship was slightly more interesting only because she was nice person. Besides that when it comes to characters, they were completely uninteresting. Morgan Freeman's role was boring, even though he is supposed to be a leader of this underground society of surviving humans, you get little to no back story what so ever, no personality, no reason at all to like him besides the fact that he is Morgan Freeman. When people died in this film, you felt nothing of it because so many people were underdeveloped. Along with that a lot of the information about the war between them and the aliens is really brushed over and we don't even get to see a picture of what they look like. Also the logic of the film goes against itself. The idea is that sense the only way they won the war was through nuclear weapons, all the humans had to leave to live on titan, one of Jupiter's moons. Though, don't you think that by that time in history were we have the technology to travel across a huge portion of the solar system, be able to create amazingly advanced spaceships and have a giant one in space where its only purpose is to create clones of this one person in little to no time at all...that we would be able to create a devise that can get rid of the radiation caused from nuclear explosions? did no one think of that? A lot of weird scenes that make no sense till the very end which is also annoying. The film in total was slow paced and though it did have an action scene here and there, they were all fairly short and not nearly as exciting as it should be. The underground survivor society of humans is practically pushed to the side so Jack can keep getting screen time. So little is ever said about the survivors at all and with such little investment, it makes for one big bore. In the end jack dies along with Freeman's character, but he comes back as a clone in the end so...ya that makes it better I guess. I am not one to be overly knit picky about this stuff, but this movie just wasn't good. It was terrible but still not good. I give it a 6 out of 10 because the affects were nice and it kept me interested enough to see then end of the film...barely. If you want to see this movie then rent it, it is not worth a purchase and I am glad I didn't see it in theaters.",Oblivion

626,aquarianavenger,More than the sum of its parts,10,21 April 2013,"I'm really irritated by all the reviews that speak only to what Oblivion has in common with other scifi movies. It is true that there are a lot, but that's what is so great about this movie. It takes all the well-worn tropes of scifi like: alien invasions, post-apocalyptic dystopia's, artificial intelligences gone awry, and a David/Goliath fight for survival and tells a fresh and engaging story. This is a movie that actually has something to say, something that I found very touching. In fact, the more I thought about it after the movie was over, the more I loved what it was saying. The overarching message is obvious enough, but the implications of what it is saying reverberate back through the storyline and give more weight to what could appear, on the surface, a simple action-adventure tale. My friends and I discussed it afterwords and made a lot of interesting observations and connections. I have to say that I am very impressed with director Joseph Kosinski who came up with the story and helped write the screenplay. His direction for Tron:Legacy was good but flawed (mostly due to a mediocre script that he didn't write), but here he guides the characters through an epic adventure with the restrained passion of a director who is confident in what he is trying to communicate to the audience. Amid the special effects and big set-pieces there is something nuanced and beautiful in what he is trying to say about life and the here-after. I would definitely recommend this movie. It has all the elements: great visuals, beautiful music, and an entertaining plot. Just keep your mind (and heart) open to the larger themes that are connected to the simpler actions of the characters.",Oblivion
627,jock75,Excellent example of Sci-Fi at its best,9,14 April 2013,"I don't usually feel the need to write about movies, but this one I think deserves my support.First of all, let me say that I am not a Tom Cruise fan; the mere fact that he is in a film is sometimes enough to put me off. But I had heard so little of this film – seriously, it seemed to have snuck into the theatres – that I decided I would give it a go. So I went to a Saturday afternoon session, on my own. And I wasn't disappointed.This was Sci-Fi at its best:, sometimes as awesome as the Matrix with regard to the VFX, but often very understated like Gattaca. The themes were really interesting and the characters were also well developed. The pace was also perfect, with a good combination of suspense, drama sometimes it was even scary.Without going on and on (I don't want to give too much away), I definitely think this is worth seeing at the cinema. Visually it is amazing. The bigger the screen, the better, in my opinion. Also has a great score.People who say they didn't ""get"" it obviously don't understand Sci-Fi.",Oblivion
628,brighambartol,A Must-See,10,12 May 2013,"Oblivion is a refreshingly brilliant story that reminds me of the classic sci-fi movies of the past. The plot is not too complicated or convoluted, and at times even a little predictable, but still very engaging and involved. All loose ends are tied and there is never a moment where you don't want to watch the story unfold. The action is great, but the film presents a well-balanced mix of character, mystery, romance, and, of course, enough CGI explosions to keep the action fans satisfied. This is my favourite film of the year so far. Oblivion is definitely one to add to the classic sci-fi collection.",Oblivion

630,levelllll5,Visually beautiful but that's it,5,2 May 2013,"We are in 2077. Tom Cruise's voice explains us that the Earth has been devastated by aliens, the Scavs, and that they also have destroyed the Moon. Men won the war, but they had to leave the Earth to go live on Titan, one of Jupiter's (or Saturne's, I'm not sure which) satellites. Before they can join them, Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are some kind of maintenance workers in charge of the drones, these little round flying and aggressive machines. The Tet, which is like a big pyramid in the sky, also hires Jack and Victoria to take care of the pumps that suck sea water. For maintenance workers, they have a pretty cool high-tech house that looks like it's hanging in the air, and that has an awesome transparent swimming-pool in which Jack and Victoria play doctor. But every night, Jack dreams of this brunette who smiles at him in the streets and who smiles at him again on top of the Empire State. He knows he knows her, but doesn't know who she is. And the cool home, and the cool pool, he doesn't care about them. Like Walden in Thoreau's book, he likes to go to a little wooden house by the lake to take a nap. And he likes the Earth too, he doesn't want to leave it, even if it's a dangerous place. So anyway. One day the girl from his dream literally falls from the sky, and with her he realizes that all he thought he knew is a big lie. A little bit of 2001, A Space Odyssey, a little bit of transcendantalism, some baseball, some romance, and a lot of special effects. Joseph Kosinski loves special effects, 3D and gadgets, and he's pretty good at that. Of course if you're looking for substance for your brain, I suggest you to go see something else.",Oblivion
631,Oddelg,Unexpectedly and expectedly good,7,15 September 2013,"Ever since the trailer came out, I have wanted to see this movie. And that for different reasons: 1. M83 was making the music to this. 2. Morgan Freeman was in it (duh) 3. It look nothing but spectacular and astonishing with great visual effects etc. All of this, only by looking at the trailer.I have not been able to see the movie before now, since I didn't reach it in the cinemas. So today I bought the DVD and have now finally seen it. Well, to say with a short sentence what I thought of the movie, here is what I say: ""I did like it a lot.""Earth has lost a battle. Well, they won the war, but only by using nuclear weapons against the aliens. In that way, humanity had to leave the so-called home. Jack and Victoria are employed to fix drones that are scanning and looking over the surface of Earth. But Jack has in a long time, wanted to stay on Earth, in which Victoria is against. One day, something unknown and old-school crash-lands in their surveillance-area that changes everything.In the beginning of this movie, it all feels like a science-fiction real-life remake of Wall-E. A Wall-E with arms, legs and an epic air-transporter. And clichés. Then things suddenly changed. In a really positive and exciting way. And the movie's pace raised noticeably. I do NOT want to spoil it to you, because, strictly speaking, after the first hour of the movie has past, it feels like it is an entirely another movie. Therefore, I do not want to talk more of the plot.Have you seen TRON: Legacy? Joseph Kosinski, who directed TRON did also write/direct Oblivion. If you remember the spectacular, mind-blowing landscapes and views from that movie, and you loved it, you will definitely love Oblivion. The way Joseph presents Earth from a past-nuclear war- view is so interestingly well made that I could watch an entire 2-hour long movie of only the landscapes of Earth in 2077. And with the incredible music of M83 underneath the spectacular visual ""orgasm"" makes the entire experience into a ""erection of both ear- and orgasm"". (Sorry, but I could not come up with any better words to describe it with.)Unfortunately, the movie had way too many clichés. From beginning to the end, the emotional scenes were way to predictable. One could easily know that they would kiss by the lake etc. That is what lowered my rating by one star.The other 2 star down was because of all the unanswered questions I got from this movie. There were so many things that I did not quite understand, that I think the crew could have worked a little bit more on for us viewers to understand. But overall, this was a REALLY good movie. It is absolutely worth the money and is really easy to enjoy by both sci-fi fans and not sci-fi fans.",Oblivion

This movie makes me think there is still hope for Hollywood. Imax made it even better experience and I'm happy it wasn't in 3d,just too much movies are done in 3d its getting boring fast.It is noticeable that the same crew worked on Tron,because visuals and sounds are amazing.I wont write anything about the plot cause i don't like spoilers in the conclusion anyone who likes to watch sci fi movies will not be disappointed and anyone who doesn't like them might just start to.

The movie previews to ""Oblivion"" made me curious and interested in watching this movie. I like this film, because the storyline is unique. Oblivion is a mix between Mel Gibson's film Mad Max – in terms of the isolation, and it also has some similarities with the movie The Matrix in terms of its storyline – without the Matrix martial arts. The lead character Jack is played perfectly by Tom Cruise – as usual. Julia played by Olga Kurylenko and Victoria played Andrea Riseborough are great characters and the actresses that played these roles were outstanding. There is a very interesting love triangle that develops among those three characters which definitely gives this film depth. Beech played by Morgan Freeman has a key role in this film, and Morgan Freeman was brilliant in playing a leader in this Science-Fiction movie.There is no real down side to this film, because the storyline is written so creatively that it keeps the viewer paying attention to the very end. This exceptional film was written and Directed by Joseph Kosinski. Be advised, this movie is set in the future in 2077 after the destruction of most of mankind so the whole film is in a state of isolation. So if you don't like movies that have isolated towns, cities, or planets than you probably won't like this film. But like I said, the unique storyline is great, the Drones are spectacular, and Tom Cruise played another memorable role – that's what I really liked about this film.The cinematography is wonderful and the CGI is even better. The Drones are my favorite part of the whole movie – they were innovatively spectacular and they definitely brought all the action to this film – hopefully you'll like them too.I give ""Oblivion"" 7 out of 10 Stars",Oblivion
636,marcus-blakelock,Oh dear Mr Cruise...,3,15 April 2013,"So let me start of by saying Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are all actors I love seeing on screen. So when I look back on this movie I genuinely cannot tell as to why these three agreed to sign up to this pile of crap.If you haven't seen this film yet and don't really know if you should or not - I'm going to make it easy for you: DON'T, like really don't - because afterwards in the car home you will be picking plot holes out with ease. The only people I'd recommend it to are die hard fans of Tom Cruise, and by that I mean REAL DIE HARD FANS because you're gonna need a bit more than loyalty to stomach the cheesy lines, obvious script and really bad flaws in this film. I wouldn't even say go see it if you're a fan of Morgan Freeman considering in this ""masterpiece"" he's in it for about 15 minutes. IF YOU DON'T WANT ANY SPOILERS DON'T READ FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS: So everyone let me draw your attention to the holes in this story: 1. Perhaps the biggest hole I've see in a pretty long time; The whole story revolves around this recording which has been beamed down to Earth and contains the original message of Tom Cruise's last mission into space... again let me say this part in particular ""HAS BEEN BEAMED DOWN TO EARTH."" So would anyone like to tell me why, when Tom listens to the recording, can he still hear himself and his co-pilot within the ship AFTER its been beamed to Earth... oh dear.2. Futuristic robots are chasing Tom, and are being held back by extremely powerful lasers - which seemingly have no effect whatsoever, yet when Tom fires one bullet from his pistol it dies.3. Tom and his co-pilot are living life in their futuristic house, swimming in their pool which can see underneath their futuristic house - yet NEVER do they think ""hmmm we've lived here for 5 years and have never checked the basement, maybe there's something down there?"" 4. Why can intelligent machines from the future pick up respiratory patters to tell if someone is lying, and detect all types of organisms, yet cannot distinguish between a man and a woman? Also they have incredible scanners which can up anything small and vaporise it - yet when hiding behind a waterfall these scanners apparently don't work anymore.5. These bad robots, who also pretty much dominate the planet and can see everything from drones and from space, forbid any type of plant surviving - yet they cant see a massive expanse of rain forest plonked right in the middle of the planet? 6. Oh and apparently advanced robots can now be repaired with chewing gum.To be honest those 6 are enough to say this movie was bad but there are also countless more which I can't even be bothered to talk about (E.G. how long does it take for a woman to die after she has been shot in the stomach, and is losing a lot of blood? Because now it seems like the amount of time it would take to start a spaceship, fly it a few hundred miles, grab some medical equipment, have a fight with a clone of yourself and then fly it back. I gave this 3 out of 10 because of the 3 things which earned it: OK special effects, Morgan Freeman's voice and the ""scav"" helmets which made me laugh quite a lot in the cinema, even though they weren't supposed to.",Oblivion
637,FNDNreview,Sci-fi Top Gun for Cruise in 'Oblivion',8,21 April 2013,"Over the course of the last few years, the science fiction genre of film has either provided major hits or complete misses. Depending on who's acting and who's directing, movie-goes appear to be fairly picky about which sci-fi films they're willing to spend their money on. In 2012, Prometheus took us back to the Aliens universe with critical and commercial success, while at the same time, Battleship and John Carter sank – ultimately drowning in a sea of misery. Speaking of sci-fi success, Tom Cruise has been a part of a handful of lucrative sci-fi endeavors, including Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and War of the Worlds. Now, Tom Cruise is back once again with another pre-summer box office smash, Oblivion.Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Lecacy), Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the few remaining survivors of the planet earth – half of which has been destroyed and deemed uninhabitable after a nuclear war with an alien species, known as Scavs (Scavengers). Harper, along with his partner and love interest, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are in charge of an operation to salvage and extract the last of earth's natural resources, prior to leaving earth and rejoining their fellow humans on a massive space station, called Titan. However, everything is not as it seems when Jack saves a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage of a crash-landing – the same woman whom he has been having recurring memories and dreams. And, after making contact with the Scavs, Jack must uncover the secrets behind the organization for which he has been working and the reasoning behind his absent memory (which was mandatorily removed) . Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo also star in supporting roles.First and foremost, do not leave the theater when you see this film – and you absolutely should see this film. Oblivion is one of the films that will require your attention at all times, because it's extremely easy to miss a giant piece of the puzzle during a bathroom break or popcorn run. The film's plot is relatively easy to decipher by the conclusion of the film, however, there's more going on in this film that you can possibly interpret in one sitting. The introduction of the film crams a whole lot of information into your head to set up the present conundrum being tackled by Cruise's character, Jack Harper. Clearly, he's involved in a snatch-n-grab job, hastily attempting to remove earth's resources, while attempting to avoid any difficulties or interaction with the supposed villains, the Scavs. However, it's impossible to get specific about the majority of the film's plot points without spoiling the film.Oblivion's cast is one of the most impressive features in this film and remains tremendously authentic from beginning to end in this enigmatic drama. Tom Cruise hasn't been this enjoyable in quite a long time and really finds his groove with his character. Reminiscent of the character from War of the Worlds, Jack Harper is mostly in the dark about the majority of the occurrences in this film and is often in over his head – yet somehow always manages to come out of each dire situation unscathed. On the other hand, his partner (Victoria) constantly finds new ways to be jealous in a world where she has absolutely no competition. At times, she can become an annoyance, but that's mostly due in large part to lack of her unwillingness to think outside the box (which is reserved solely for Tom Cruise's character). Finally, let's face the fact here – everything is better with Morgan Freeman.By far and away, the most enjoyable moments of the film revolve around the CGI action sequences – which include some very intriguing and well-designed drones. These drones are the main agitators in a rather Empire Strikes Back-like flight batter which is also a nice flashback to Tom Cruise sitting in a cockpit in Top Gun. It's unclear whether or not the filmmakers meant to create a throwback sci-fi Top Gun-style chase scene, but regardless, this specific flight chase will have you wishing for a Top Gun sequel (which was sadly canceled after the death of its original director, Tony Scott).Overall, there's absolutely nothing in Oblivion that hasn't been done in some other sci-fi before it. Sure, it would be easy to say this is just another post-apocalyptic film with alien invaders, ultimately forcing humanity to unite for a greater good to defeat them. Yet, this film is much more complex than your average space-invaders film. It provides a busier (occasionally confusing) than usual plot (in Prometheus fashion), so if you look away, you'll most likely miss something important. But, if you play close enough attention to the plot points, you'll be able to tie everything together in a nice, pretty bow when the credits role – hopefully coming to the conclusion that Oblivion is a perfectly fun and enjoyable sci-fi film.Overall Film Grade: A-",Oblivion
638,ronhardcastle,Don't know why this movie didn't make it,10,19 August 2013,"I have now watched this movie 3 times, and each time have liked it more than I did the first time, and even then I still enjoyed it a lot. I look at the litany of trash on the screen that DOES make a profit and am dismayed that this one was so unsuccessful. First, it's a GORGEOUS movie, and it definitely has a beating heart. I found the acting quite good, the story involving, and was quite moved more than once. And the technical staff was amazing! I suspect that it will do well on home video and cable and that one day we'll look back on it and wonder why in the world it did so poorly in its initial run. I applaud director Kosinsky and his fine team of actors and the legion of other professionals involved in bringing this to the screen. I REALLY enjoyed this movie!31Jan14: Months later and I've watched it at least once more from my Blu-ray plus find it almost impossible to NOT watch it when I stumble across it on HBO, and I continue to find it absorbing and I STILL can't watch the end of it without crying! I find it embarrassing to write this, but I think I love this movie.",Oblivion
639,prayingwolf,Positive Surprise,8,15 August 2013,"I didn't have high hopes, when I went to see this.Immediately though I was captivated by the beautiful visual style in both the landscape, architecture and especially the cool technology (HUDs and touch-screens etc.). It was simply stunning!As for the plot, it wasn't too original as such, but I loved the ""husband and housewife"" -interplay between ""Jack"" and ""Victoria"". It was somehow cozy to see a single couple alone in a vast rough environment - together, but separated. There was a distinct air of longing about the whole setup.One of the most memorable (and silliest) moments was when ""Jack"" rode his motorcycle for a long stretch of desert. Seemed kinda pointless for him to have to use a motorcycle but it was a nice scene otherwise.Which brings me to the music. I loved it. I give the movie 8/10 for the visual style, music and the bitter-sweet chemistry between the main characters.",Oblivion

No one I watched this with had trouble picking the minor twists and turns the plot takes, but it was quite fun talking about it after the movie. Also it leaves quite a lot unanswered, but sometimes that is half the fun, once again spurring conversation.There were a few minor plot holes and ideas that make you question the motive behind those making them, but nothing that ruins the good mood of the film.Overall enjoyable and fun.",Oblivion
641,leetpaint,Laughably bad yet entertaining,4,20 August 2013,"The only criticism I've heard of this stupid movie so far that wasn't from the voices in my own head was that Tom Cruise is in it, and that he's a Scientologist...really people? Who cares? Anyway, if you are a movie buff, you will surely get some good laughs from this movie, it's very cheesy, but in the good kind of way. I'm still glad I saw this at the Dollar movie. Tom Cruise uses his skills he learned while flying F- 14s in 'Top Gun' to dodge lightning in this movie when he is being chased by killer drones. No, seriously. He literally dodges lightning and it hits the drones behind him. I always write about spoilers in bad movies because it really isn't worth saving up for so here it is. The 'aliens' are the human resistance led by Morgan Freeman! So after years of fighting Tom Cruises drone army, all Morgan Freeman does is leave behind books and things for him...what? Why would they not just leave a note behind that says ""Stop killing us, we are people, here is an enclosed picture of our rag-tag army without our predator helmets on, see? We're humans and you are a clone, and so is your sexy clone partner."" They leave the helmets and predator gear on to ""fool"" the killer drones. WHAT? Oh OK, that explains everything, thank you, movie. That wraps is all up guys. Then the all knowing computer mothership thing lets the humans crash land on Earth for some reason... it's not like the mothership doesn't know about the human craft in orbit. It was right in front of the mothership at one point. Just send out a drone to blast it while in orbit...the drones knew to kill the survivors AFTER the crash, but not before? What? OK there are just so many things to point out for being stupid. Also, why does this have a 7.1? Like how Tom Cruise in this movie seems pretty intelligent, why does he believe he will be ""fried"" in the ""Radiation Zones""? His high tech ship and cool gear doesn't protect him from radiation at all? If it would fry you in the zone, wouldn't the radiation at least harm you when you are close to it? Why doesn't he question that at all? He just accepts that he can't go there. So in closing it sucks, but in a good way. It would be wroth renting at the Red Box if you are bored and wanna drink some beers with your buddies and laugh at all the really obnoxiously retarded parts.

The premise of the movie is novel & i liked it.U don't grasp the exact plot until the last few minutes & what happened.Tom cruise excelled well as always & taken the movie to the next level.What seems to be a post apocalyptic plot which is focused on what happens when earth becomes uninhabitable, turns the other way round as the movie goes on, revealing the story gradually & what exactly happened to earth.I'll cut short the movie in synopsis.1.Movie starts with Jack harper (Tom)working on a mission after which he & his partner plan to move to Titan(Moon of Saturn) as earth became uninhabitable due to the nuclear war between Humans & Scavs(aliens)and the moon already got consumed by the alien invasion.2.Tom actually maintains Drones(sort of robots)that defend the rigs that extract fusion energy from water bodies which will be used for mission.3.He daily comes to earth on this purpose & often encountered with scavs still residing on earth.But he is refrained from entering radiation zone which could cook him to death.4.Moreover,He often gets a dream of meeting a mysterious woman he never know at empire state building in US.This haunts him every now & then.5.One day, they (Tom & his partner) observe an anonymous signal being transmitted off the earth, & Jack pursues to find the truth from this point of movie.6.There will be a series of events which unfold to what exactly happened to earth & his mission is meant to be.Further knowing spoils the effect of the movie.U will find answers for every hell of ur queries.So just concentrate on the content, it is novel & interesting if u could interpret it.Or else u feel it a crap of a movie.It may not be the best, but surely a good watch for Sci-fi lovers & u may repeat it.",Oblivion

Tom Cruise should get a new job--perhaps a commentator on Scientology radio?--and forget acting.I am not a dope--an HLS grad--but this thing was so out of it that any dissatisfied viewers (I hope there were many, despite the amazingly high rating the unscientific IMDb poll gave to this unfathomable work) should join in a class action to have their money refunded and obtain extra damages for emotional distress. Not only was Cruise poor, but Morgan Freeman was even worse. The female leads were so bad it is hard for me to imagine how they were chosen in the first place. ETC.

This applies to machine intelligences as much as it does to those manipulated by them. Ultimately, we all make mistakes and we are all punished for them.Kosinskis film uses tropes from other sci-fi movies (what sci-fi movie doesn't?) and wraps them in the prettiest looking visuals since Bladerunner. The sci-fi future it depicts is almost retro in it's homage to various prog rock album cover art from the 1970's. This is a strength.Its main weakness is an unwillingness to push its world building further into the plot and stick to rather safer blockbuster territory with predictable twists and unreasonable optimism. The visuals remain a wallpaper essentially as the plot carries our hero onward is ways we have seen before, so many times.Nevertheless it is a far better film than critics would have you believe and Kosinski has delivered the goods here, well worth a look.",Oblivion

650,maubet,Pretty solid Sci-Fi and a great way to start the summer.,8,19 April 2013,"Oblivion is a movie that you can go and see without any false expectations. It intents to be a Summer Blockbuster and a Tom Cruise vehicle and it does so without any qualms. However, it also manages to be good science fiction in sort of the smart end of the spectrum.My personal rule of thumb for good science fiction is that it has to contain the following:1.- A fully developed setting. 2.- A plausible premise. 3.- An examination of human nature (or at least some aspects of it)Oblivion contains all three and it also provides a couple of bonuses: a) some social commentary through the mindless repetition of greetings and ""power phrases"" that echo the worst of corporate culture and b) a lot of neat references to other films like Terminator, Predator, Blade Runner and most prominently 2001: A Space Odyssey.The most notorious references to the Stanley Kubric classic are shown towards the end of the movie, but is obvious that *** BIG SPOILER ALERT*** the main premise of the movie is based on ""What if the alien race in 2001 had not been benign"" ***END SPOILER***The visuals of the film are fantastic and the action and the pacing are pretty good too. Overall Director Joseph Kosinski did a great job. My only complain is the very last scene / shot of the film, i feel that is somewhat unnecessary and it would have been better to let the viewer reach that conclusion with their own imagination (after all is very predictable), but what can we do, I guess that is the nature of the Hollywood beast.The acting is solid in general, even if the characters are not fully developed. Tom Cruise shows once again why he is one of the industry's best leading men. I have to admit though, that I was not too impressed with Olga Kurylenko's performance, but that may be because I can't help thinking that Jessica Chastain would have done a much more interesting job.All in all Oblivion is a must see movie for this summer. I would say that is some mindless fun that manages to have some brains in it.",Oblivion
651,pilotvulcan,An immersive and frightening possibly prophetic look at our future,10,29 October 2020,"Cruise has to be one of the ultimate actors of our time and from one pilot to another.....an all round good guy! Morgan Freeman provides another powerful performance in his inimitable fashion as a rebel fighting for survival and for the planet itself. The ubiquitous Andrea Riseborough plays Toms partner with a twist........Olga Kurylenko also featuring in a marvellous and unexpected way! The flight sequences are breathtaking and accurate, nothing equals being up high above the clouds dancing on laughter silvered wings! Tom is a SUPERB real life aviator and he puts this into the flying segments as no other could! As a lousy amateur 'composer' and general keyboards, guitars and music NUT my compliments to M83 for THE most haunting score since the original Bladerunner, by Vangelis! Now guys dont take that lightly as that movie is NUMBER ONE in my hall of fame but now EQUAL is Oblivion. I will watch the movie at LEAST once a month.....or more. Susanne Sundfør AWESOME VOICE in the closing credits song!
It is not a mere movie is is a total immersion into this post apocalyptic future, terrifying and possibly prophetic considering the state of the planet in 2020. A MASTERPIECE, if I could meet Mr Cruise one day I would like to just shake his hand and thank him for all the movies!",Oblivion

654,smellyville90,An excellent homage to the sci-fi greats,8,21 July 2013,"I like many other reviewers here truly recommend viewing this film with a clean slate. That is really how all movies should be viewed anyway, if this were a perfect world. If anyone happens to be reading this who has not yet seen the movie, just stop reading reviews and go watch it.One thing I notice is that people are complaining that this is a 'rip off' of previous sci-fi films and that should be a bad thing. I disagree. Leaving the theatre I had the distinct impression that the director wanted to weave together a slew of creative sci-fi themes and into one standalone film, and I think he did a fantastic job. It is an excellent homage to the great sci-fi movies that have come before it and I think the mistake is in thinking that this movie is trying to be one of them. It isn't. I tire of the critics who yelp at every movie that doesn't present an original idea as though originality is the only key to successful film making. I also tire of the Tom Cruise critics, who seem to grasp at any opportunity to discredit the man, despite the fact that he *is* a great actor who has made some very good movie choices over the past decade. In my opinion, a good movie is one that makes you think and affects you in some positive way long after viewing it. While Oblivion is a first rate entertainment movie - with it's stunning visuals and hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that shines throughout - it is also a dissection of humanity. There are clear religious elements to this movie as well, which I found surprising (Adam and Eve: ""another day in paradise""). While the ideas presented here seem very familiar to avid sci-fi fans (Hello Moon and Matrix!), Oblivion utilizes these themes to convey a message about the enduring human spirit. A message that is worth repeating in cinema. Oblivion is also a character piece rather than a strictly 'humans vs aliens' piece and while Tom Cruise does not pull out any major stops here, his acting is solid, and you warm to his character by the end of the film. Morgan Freeman is just Morgan Freeman. And there's nothing wrong with that, because the dude is awesome. I think a special mention should go to Andrea Riseborough here. Her acting was also solid throughout and I feel her achievements are being overlooked.More than anything, I feel that the soundtrack to Oblivion is what sold it to me. The film is bathed in a beautiful musical score and the theme especially is just fantastic. It would be a crying shame for Oblivion to not be nominated for best original score as this is where it truly triumphs. The music is atmospheric and has an ethereal quality to it.Altogether, a beautiful piece of cinema that is a feast for the eyes, ears and soul. The only thing I can say that I wish was explained more in this movie would be the villain, as their motives in the final segment of this movie makes little sense. However, enjoy it for what it is and don't cry for what it is not. I give this a 8/10 which is quite high, but I feel it deserves a high rating as this is a high quality film. Don't miss it.",Oblivion
655,micskogabor,Oblivion: A movie worth 'going out' for?,7,13 June 2013,"Oblivion had been on my 'must-see' radar for quite a while now. First because director Joseph Kosinski has already proved himself as being a capable director with Tron: Legacy, and second, for not jumping on the 'nowadays mandatory' 3D bandwagon. Tron didn't fully live up to it's true potential with it's questionable narrative decisions, but Oblivion (at least as the early trailers indicated) seemed like a more character- driven and unique movie. Oblivion follows the story of Jack Harper (Tom Cruise), one of the last few humans stationing on Earth somewhere in the distant future. Earth is devastated by a nuclear blast, and the remainder of humanity live on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Jack is tasked from higher above to repair and maintain the drones responsible for defending some drill-like machines, which are extracting energy from Earth's water resources. On patrol on his mission he discovers a spaceship full of survivors crashed into the surface which will ultimately lead him to question everything he knows.Despite that the story borrows from familiar scripts, it still follows a strong narrative. As the story unfolds more characters start to fill up the screen and the plot becomes more convoluted and befuddling. But in the end, everything will make sense though.Lead actor Tom Cruise projects strong performance, and contrary to the film's motto, he indeed makes an effective team with his inmate 'lover' Vica (Andrea Riseborough). Morgan Freeman (who admittedly has less role than the posters would suggest) provides contrast and color to Tom's role. Not only the cast excels, it's also the imagery of the wasteland which is drear and wonderfully realized. It mixes the design elements (spaceships, drones, the weaponry of Jack) of Mass Effect, with the barren and outlandish scenarios of Fallout. The visuals accompanied by the epic soundtrack made by M83 make a powerful 'audiovisual' whole.Bottom lineKosinki delivers a strong and excellent fiction. Where the pacing or the narration falls short, the orgasmic audiovisuals kick in. I, for one, tremendously enjoyed it with all it's inconsistencies, and it's absence left me craving for some more sci-fi action.",Oblivion
656,toppin,Visually excellent though slightly too long,8,11 April 2013,"This movie is - without a doubt - one of the most visually spectacular that I have ever seen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder in that department with the likes of Watchmen, Prometheus, Sunshine and Kosinski's preceding effort - TRON: Legacy. Also (like TRON) the soundtrack is excellent and very well used throughout, enhancing the action and adding depth to some - at times - distinctly average acting performances.Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise but that's not a bad thing in this case, in fact his natural charisma carries the movie through some of its slower sections. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman though he's really not on screen for long enough to influence the movie one way or another. Olga Kurylenko's statuesque profile is unfortunately not matched by her acting ability and I often found it difficult to believe in her character's actions and emotions. Andrea Riseborough turns in maybe the best performance, convincing as the sad and confused Victoria, unwilling - or perhaps unable - to confront the disturbing truth.At over 2 hours I think that it's too long by about 20 minutes. A shorter cut would tighten up the story and eliminate some of the slower sections which I think hurt the movie's overall rhythm and flow.Overall, I would definitely recommend going to see this movie in the cinema, on the biggest screen that you can find. It just won't be the same on TV. The visual appeal alone is reason enough, but combined with a clever (if not entirely original) script, a thumping soundtrack and some exciting action, you should be entertained.",Oblivion
657,boulamatiemike,"Overall a fun time,but some significant flaws",6,28 September 2013,"There is a lot of fun to be had with this flick.First off,although it's no surprise,Tom Cruise shows yet another time he can act. That being said, none of the actors do a bad job. They are all decent in their roles,but none of them does a phenomenal job. Now the practical effects and the visuals are stunning. The CGI is great and the whole landscape shots are amazing. Now let's talk some some of the issues with this film. Some people complained for it having a similar ending/story to another film,which I will not name since this is a spoiler-less review,but you probably know which one I'm talking about. The movie itself is predictable at times,although it does have a number of good twists throughout,which you see coming if you know about the other film.Me having not seen it,I wasn't quite taken out of the movie as some other people apparently had.This film is not by any means bad,but it's just decent,when,given the concept and the casting,it could have been great.Morgan Freeman was really underused here and I really wanted him to have played a bigger role in this,same goes for other characters.My biggest issue with the film is the pacing.First it starts off slow,then picks up for some action,then slows down again for big portion of the movie.Although you are kind of interested in what's going on,the pacing really does not help and might even bore you,as it did to me. There is an epic battle and some amazing moments but the character development is lacking and close to non-existent.So, summing up, Oblivion is a fun time with some friends but not nearly the scientific original epic it presented itself to be. With its amazing visuals and fun action scenes,it's not a movie I regretted seeing but neither would I recommend it.",Oblivion
658,gabormark75,Tom Cruise blows up Scientology?,10,24 May 2013,"First of all this film is an excellent sci-fi, very well put together, and I really enjoyed it.I only started thinking about deeper meaning of the film, related to private life of Tom Cruise, when I saw the very end, when Tom returns to a woman and daughter looking almost like ex-wife Katie and Suri, and saying he is where he belongs, home.Before this happened, he destroyed an upside down pyramid with an eye inside, flying in space, who he first thought were friends but brainwashed him. Scientology is about aliens coming to earth bla bla, if I am not wrong?The woman put to work with him looks like Nicole Kidman, red hair, etc, but it turns out only forced by the evil aliens. They live a perfect life, but Tom dreaming about living in a cabin by the lake. With the other woman.

Some have complained that this film is derivative... but with the wealth of science fiction stories, series and movies that exist in the world at this point, it would be hard not to be a little derivative. The Matrix was derivative. Didn't stop it being a modern classic.In fact, this movie is a real homage to the best themes and traits of classic science fiction. The plot plays out like a very large-scale early 20th century sci-fi novel with added hi-octane action, the visuals are frankly stunning (blame Iceland's scenery for much of that) and Tom Cruise and co. give really solid, seamless performances.The ambient music is really well integrated with the rest of the movie, and the score is just a touch quirky in places, enough to be original by Hollywood standards.It's got plot, visuals, soundtrack, performances... and even a subtle subversive political message (subtle enough to annoy some people without them realizing why, methinks).

The story for me was sometimes a little bit hard to progress, maybe the quality of the theme and special effects where the big thing for me to focus on.. It was a good 10,- spend and if there would be a second part it would definitely be something I would wanna see. It's not al action like the trailer.. Go in with clear mind and realise that this movie is more then an action movie. Oblivion is about love, emotions, hurt and believing what's the best thing to do. Good movie. 7/10 // Leroy",Oblivion
662,SolomonHeale,"Beautiful film, slightly less beautiful plot.",7,13 April 2013,"Oblivion takes place in a future where Earth is a desolate wasteland, essentially destroyed by mysterious alien forces. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) – not to be mistaken with Jack Reacher – is a former veteran who has been tasked with farming Earth for it's remaining resources with the 'help' of Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) – that 'help' being staring woefully at a screen.From there, the plot get's pretty damn complicated. Rather than spoiling the story by trying to explain it, it's probably just better to warn you that a headache is waiting for those who are planning on attempting to follow what the hell is going on (and not even the good kind of headache – or the Memento headache, if you will.) It's probably a film that is better the second time around.The performances are competent, nothing really to shout home about. Risebourough is probably the weakest of the pack, giving a performance that would sit a lot better in a Bond film. Morgan Freeman performs his 'Mysterious man with a voice that could cool lava' act with all the usual finesse – although honestly it's a bit of a con him being on the poster, since he only has about 10 minutes of screen time overall.The most notable thing about the film is just how beautiful it is. It really is one of the best looking films in recent years – right up there with Prometheus (Which honestly is the only thing you'd want to have in common with Prometheus.)The film has a fantastic score to go with the brilliant visuals, which makes for a truly epic experience. If you don't feel your pulse raising the damn roof during the ending sequence, then you're probably dead – Killed by a heart attack that was brought on by the sheer intensity of the scene. Either that or you just don't get excited easily. Which is fair enough.The issue here, is that it seems that Kosinki focused too hard on making it look good, rather than making it feel good.The film is 2 hours, which is a fair length, but at times it can feel slow. Really slow. It probably didn't need to be as long as it is, because a lot of the content feels like artificial padding. The first half of the film is basically Cruise farting around on Earth, getting scanned by flying robots and falling down holes.Also, the general story just feels overly-contrived. It's hard to crucify it like it really needs to be without spoiling it, but really it just comes down to the film just trying to do to much. It's spread thinner than a jam sandwich made by someone with a crippling fear of spreading jam. The one good thing to come from it is that we get to see Tom Cruise fist fight himself which is always fun.In all honesty, setting aside the 'quite stupid but still complicated as hell' plot, the film is actually quite good. It's no masterpiece, but it's exciting, thought-provoking, and of course - insanely good looking. So if you're the kind of person who cracks one out to The Tree of Life, then this film is a must-see. If you care more about content, it's still a good film to check out, but it's not going to awe you in any way. Watch with caution though, because this film may be the one that brings to light your extremely debilitating fetish for beautiful cinematography.",Oblivion
663,jckandersen-139-688098,Hope for Sci-Fi,8,2 June 2014,"Oblivion was one of those films, that went below my radar, and it wasn't until I saw it on a streaming service, that I thought this might be good, and it is.You can read the synopsis here on IMDb, but the story is not new and it's been seen before. However, this movie consists of beautiful images - a visual impact, that is so clean - so crisp. You get the sense that everything is controlled in this wasteland on earth, through the perfect imagery. It is the camera here that tells the story - not dialog.The soundtrack is downright gorgeous and supports that subtle feeling this movie has.I love that sci-fi is slowly returning, where the real notion of scientific-fiction is taken seriously. Oblivion is one of those movies, in line with Prometheus and Moon.I rank this movie 8/10, while not breaking new grounds, it is visually stunning, all the actors deliver, the soundtrack is one of the best I've listened to in a long time!",Oblivion
664,Hausmannsgate,Worth your while,7,13 April 2013,"I went to see Oblivion on premier night, and I had no expectations what so ever. But I must say that it was a positive surprise to me. The direction and style in Oblivion is close to flawless. A scene involving a swimming pool, close to the beginning, stands out in my memory as particularly well done - almost a work of art. All the visuals in this film are beautiful and full of imagination. The soundtrack by M83 is spectacular, and reminds me of Mass Effect. The script, sadly, is not so spectacular. It's not so bad as to ruin the movie, but it has some plot holes and predictable outcomes. It also resembles another very creative script, which sort of makes it feel less original, even if the resemblance wasn't due to directly stealing. The acting was okay. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, a good actor, but not a particularly interesting character in this film. Morgan Freeman is good, but the role is small and also not very engaging. Olga Kurylenko is the weakest link, and I didn't find her very believable in her role.

665,acscpt-537-461080,Nice one this one,8,29 July 2013,"Honestly i wasn't expecting much of this movie. The latest Scfi movies didn't bring nothing new to us. But I was wrong about this one. This is a good movie to enjoy. The vfx are awesome , the story interesting and the acting good, specially Tom Cruise that plays the role of a man (Jack) emotional connected to the planet Earth, even after it's devastation during the war with alien entities. Jack suddenly starts to doubt about everything when he faces strange occurrences and meets someone that he's not expecting at all. All of the character's psychical variations are extremely well conducted by Tom Cruise's performance. No doubt a movie to watch in the big screen",Oblivion
666,igorbozovic81,Forget that Tom Cruise is in - movie is actually not bad at all,8,25 August 2013,"I was practically forced by myself to watch this movie, because I don't like Tom Cruise and his craziness in real life. It started like any of respected SciFi movies, slowly and boring with technical mambo-jumbo in front of the plot. Then, the story finally begun and we had a chance to meet Jack (T.Cruise) as real human being with feelings for material stuff and other humans. Total opposite is the character of his sexual/living/working partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), which is smart, beautiful, obedient to the human command on the main ship preparing to go to ""new"" Earth on Titan. As Jack is abducted by the ""Aliens"" he's fighting against, we come to realize what's the true purpose of Jack and Victoria and why are they so unique. Nothing to impress, You'll figure it out too, but I won't write about it. It's actually not great movie and shouldn't stay in one's memory for too long, but a thrilling movie that will not get boring till the end (after that few boring minutes at the start).",Oblivion
667,Jongould9-598-329696,Brilliant beginning,6,14 April 2013,"Once past the initial old memory scene, the second scene where Jack's monologue summarises the current state of play is visually stunning and is complimented by a powerful score which has great momentum. Tom Cruises monologue is superbly spoken and contains brief but shocking descriptions, with the score matching at this point which then reaches a crescendo as the films title appears. Absolutely brilliant!He flies off and lands to repair a drone. From this point onwards the film becomes quite ordinary. There are some great moments beyond this but overall it is not so good. There are several revelations but none of them have great impact! (Spoilers follow) Jack finds out that he has been killing humans every time he thought he was killing aliens. He should have been puking at this revelation but his reaction is non-existent. He finds out that he is one of many clones but there is no great revelation moment for us as his reaction is negligible. I think there are scenes where the budget was clearly low such as the underground human complex which is small and has too few extras, the destruction of the spaceship which is unconvincing and the old human affected landscapes which were nicely stark but lacked the detail which the illustrated novel had described such as at the ship graveyard. In summary, some great concepts and at times visually stunning but was not able to deliver the impact that such powerful revelations should have provided.",Oblivion

We decided to order a movie in our hotel room one night and we picked this since everything else looked unappealing. We were both blown away by how good it was. Tom Cruise was fantastic. It was nice to see him do something other than another Mission Impossible. The whole movie we were trying to figure out what happened and the reveal was unexpected and very sad. Very few movie tug at my heart strings but this one did. The visuals and great soundtrack really round out the good story and make this an amazing movie. I really wish I had seen it in theaters. Immediately after my wife wanted to know when we could get it on blu-ray. A first for her since she is not an avid movie watcher.

Let us agree there can only be one inception. Complicating a movie does automatically give it a certain level of sophistication. It is a predictable movie in many aspects, and the other half is simply confusing. It is not a movie that you are likely to think about twice, or remember throughout time.

The plot is very interesting, without ever becoming boring. I really like the whole scenario. Acting is very good, Tom Cruise really nailed this one in my opinion. Sound effects are great.

You can literally tell this story 10 minutes long and it would have been way better than this waste of time. Everything is so cliché' and and all the emotions expressed are just so dramatic for no reason. You don't even get the feel of oblivion in the entire movie.

Also, what was that truth he (Jack Harper) found out when he went to the ""radiation zone""? I have the impression some scenes were cut out from the movie I watched, although it lasted entire 2 hours. I could feel how I was getting old during these 2 hours. OMGThan his dreams. His memories. Now, has he been wiped out or not? OK, the machine had failed. Lucky him the dreams remained were of his beloved and, why not to say, hot wife instead of his grandfather. Otherwise he wound have this strange dreams with an old man, that probably would drive him nuts.Another ""observation"". There is this explosion they see and Jack is ordered to not check it out. He does! there are 4 or 5 survivors. One of them is the girl he has been dreaming about. The drones come and start shooting them all and he is right next to the girl, so he avoids her death by putting himself in front of the girl, so the drone gets nuts, deciding whether to terminate the target or all good. Finally the drone decides to leave in peace and not to shoot. This assures American military institution was not involved in its design... ..Now what's the probability of (1)being the only curious Jack Harper out of thousands out there. Because Morgan Freeman said ""He was different"". (2)Of having dreams about a women he doesn't know, (3)to be the only survivor of a crush that he (4)supposed to not to assist?

Well, how did it get there with the module? At the end of the movie Jack is listening to it and we see scenes where Julia as well as the other astronauts are jettisoned away in the module from the main ship and the main ship is still recording and so therefore the flight recorder is still with the ship which goes into the TET.I can just imagine these idiots sitting around writing this script. One of them quips, ""Jack needs to get captured here."" ""Well, how do we write that in,"" Billy Bob answers. ""I don't know,"" says his cousin Joe Bob, ""how about Julia wants to get the flight recorder and so they go back to crash site.""

678,suprabh,A Visual Delight,10,10 May 2013,"As a big fan of the sci-fi genre, it often saddens me to see the same old Aliens attacking the earth and wearing slightly different costumes every time. Somehow someone always turns out to be the hero and saves planet earth. All the innovation on the part of filmmakers is spent on the guns, artillery and destruction images. For me, this doesn't work at all. What I desire to see in a Sci-fi movie- more importantly a movie dealing with Outer Space are images- Strong images that emphasizes on the idea of the life beyond earth or far from earth. This is where 2001: A space Odyssey succeeded in an almost unparalleled way. Those visuals that showed the outer space or should I say the Director's (or the novelist's) imagination of the outer space. Those images and the strong focus and pause on each and every image are what made it so much special. Similarly Danny Boyle's Sunshine or Duncan Jones's Moon worked for me big time- both have them having strong focus on the visuals and done subtly.Watching Oblivion was a great experience for me. It's quite different from what's shown in the Trailers. It's such a breath of fresh air from the loud action zero story science fiction which have less science in the fiction. The most striking feature of the film is its visuals. From Tom cruise's Aircraft to the monitoring system to his station where he lives are all simply stunning, There's a scene where the lead actress goes bare body in a swimming pool- Trust me if you will- the beauty of that scene is not the actress's body but the swimming pool. The Images of a disaster struck Earth and the mini twists in the story compliment the visuals beautifully. It's a long 2 hour plus film and believe me, I was ready to watch it again once it got over.The story is very good if not great and even though I could guess the twists and turns, I liked it that they were there. The first 30 minutes and the last 15 minutes are visually stunning. Tom Cruise is perfect for this role. It's amazing how calmly he portrayed a character which could have been done horribly wrong by some other actors. Tom displays the right emotions and manages to depict his attachment to his planet through his monologues and gestures.Oblivion is a great film for me. Not because it has an exceptional story to tell but because the path the filmmaker chose to tell it. There could have been a lot of noise and unnecessary activity in this film but it remains subtle and does the job in a brilliant way. Love it for the story , love it for the background score, love it for discovering the now getting lost emotion of ""Man's love for his planet"" and love it for the visuals. I hope there are more such Sci-fi movies in the future.",Oblivion

What It lacks is dialogue, characters and acting. Olga Kurylenko is lucky she is pretty hot as she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. All she manages to do in this movie is move her eyes and that's not even convincing.If Cruise wasn't leading this shambles this movie would have fallen by the way side and went straight to DVD. I'm a fan of Melissa Leo and what we got to see of her was nothing to write home about. Zoe Bell, who we know for her excellent stunts and balls to the wall attitude was wasted in this role, she did nothing, didn't even speak. Huge let down.

The characters were one dimensional and forgettable. The plot twists were insanely predictable, just like every other regurgitated money grabbing Pseudo Sci-Fi flick out there. For some reason I felt like I was watching a crappy, live action, violent yet some how boring version of Wall-E.

682,ystump-1,Mediocrity is fate worse than failure.,5,15 April 2013,"Mediocrity is a fate worse than failure when it comes to entertainment. An audience remembers a truly awful movie as much as they do a great one, if for completely different reasons. But nobody remembers a mediocre movie, it's just.....there. Nothing stands out about it or separates it from the hundreds of others in mediocre hell.Well, make room for one more mediocre, forgettable movie.Oblivion is the newest sci-fi/action flick starring Tom Cruise & directed by Joseph Kosinski (TRON:Legacy). In the year 2070 Earth has basically been destroyed due to a war with aliens (Scavs), the moon was blown up which caused numerous natural disasters and prompted Earth to go to war with the Scavs. The humans won, but the Earth lost, the entire population of Earth was moved to Saturns' moon, Titan. Earth is patrolled by drones that eliminate any remaining Scavs and those drones are monitored by two people; Jack Harper (Cruise) & his assigned partner Victoria. Jack soon finds out there's more living on Earth than just the Scavs & everything he thought was true is questioned. Oblivion is an original story & a great premise but it just doesn't do anything special. It starts of great & is a ton of fun for the first 30 minutes but quickly comes to a screeching bore. It's fantastic to look at though, Kosinski makes some beautiful movies I'll give him that. Like TRON:Legacy, it's a joy to look at, has some good action but is ultimately boring, overly long & too ambitious for it's own good. It's about 30 minutes too long & suffers through some pacing issues in the second half. This movie took longer to end than Return of the King. I had recently turned the corner with Tom Cruise; loved Jack Reacher & discovered the incredible Collateral. I was really excited for this one due to this; I have to give Cruise a pass for this one. He doesn't get to do ""his thing"", kinda cocky/totally confident hero that you will always root for. He starts off this way but somewhere in there he loses his charm & the movie suffers for it. I don't blame Cruise for this, you're only as good as the materials you're working with. Morgan Freeman has an extended cameo & he plays Morgan Freeman as usual. Oblivion is yet another case of the trailers deceiving the audience; instead of a sci-fi flick with a ton of action, great visuals, original story & a fun hero I got an overly long, too ambitious, boring, great looking, original story with a boring hero. Oblivion was one of my anticipated movies for 2013, it will be ultimately forgotten & looked at as a missed opportunity & replacement for Ambien for me.www.backdoorreviews.com",Oblivion

684,llamasite,"First time writing a review, awful film, don't waste your time",4,22 July 2014,"Good premise, clichéd dialogue, terrible script, and oh my god, the worst possible sound for home viewing.Firstly, what is good about this movie; decent premise for a SciFi movie, fantastic special effects. That is all.The dialogue, and strength of script is probably what you would expect from a bad Schwarzenegger film, but without any of the fun. It's really hard to become immersed in this film. The action sequences are dull, linear chases, nothing exciting or surprising. These super high tech drones, are seemingly easily disabled by a single bullet or bolt of lightening, and can't spot their targets through a thin veil of water. A good chase sequence should be won by something surprising and exciting, not something lazy and unrealistic. The same with action sequences. Every action sequence in this film composes of a huge fire fight against over-whelming odds, won by magic bullet that disables the seemingly impervious foe. It's just lazy.The sound effects and quality of dialogue were probably the final bullet in this feature for me. The voices and dialogue are whispered, and muffled. When you are having trouble understanding what words are being spoken by the likes of Morgan Freeman, you know it's bad. I had to turn the volume on my sound system to near maximum in order to hear what the characters were saying. The problem with this is that the sound effects are ridiculously loud. A door will open with the gusto of a thousand collapsing buildings. I am sure my neighbours hated this movie more than me. It may be acceptable in a cinema, but it makes it totally inappropriate for normal home viewing. I don't really want it to sound like a nuclear bomb is literally exploding in my living room in order to be able to hear the crap script the actors are spewing out.I usually like Tom Cruise SciFi films.

I was totally disappointed when the wife didn't say ""I Love You"" in critical and poignant scene. The story is only fairly good, but lacks credibility. But then, most Sci-Fi stories are based on a premise that has no credibility. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy good Sci-Fi, but this story doesn't come close to the works of some of the the Sci-Fi masters.

687,dl-alpha-omega,The reason movies are made..,10,9 May 2013,"Perhaps you have already seen the previews or heard others talk about Oblivion. Maybe formed an view but haven't quite got around to seeing it for yourself yet.For me, movies like Oblivion are the reason movies are made.I have heard some people say that this movie was a bit slow, but it was ideal for me. I like action movies (perhaps more than most) but the best movies are those where the action has some meaning and the you care whether the characters live or die or something significant is depending on them. In this film - certainly I felt like the action (fantastic action - particularly the flight pursuit scene) had purpose. Characters - are very well develop and I don't think time was wasted on them even.It is a beautifully shot movie with an astounding soundtrack, some would say even haunting. I am not always a fan of constant dark or foreboding worlds (like the director's previous Tron Legacy or Cruise's Minority Report), but Cruise's character somehow in his own lost way never seems to allow us to descend into deep melancholy. Some say he carries the film, but certainly he brings an air of optimism to the scene and a touch with the reality on this side of the screen. Logic suggests other actors could also play his role. But it is hard to see someone else being able to do it better.It is a movie of a post apocalyptic world which I must say often draws me in, where existence for Cruise's character and his partner is lonely until an unexpected arrival from space.I will not go too much into the plot. It is a film with twists and revelations, but it is a film you feel you are living in. Yes, I have heard some people talk about it not having enough shots fired or maybe a copy of ideas from films like Wall-E, but I found it dramatic, very original possessing fantastic action of consequence. Perhaps like me (and many others), you will sit after the movie is over and listen to the wonderful soundtrack, being haunted by the memory and thinking about it even after a good nights sleep.For me very few movies have had such an effect on me. But it reminds me of the reason movies are made. Should be made. And why we will always watch them.",Oblivion

689,Penderworth,Moon starring Tom Cruise,5,3 May 2013,"Oblivion is not at all original. If that were the only bad things about it, the film would still succeed at being entertaining. But it continues to stumble in several areas:The trailer is so misleading that it may as well have been for an entirely different film. - Technology in Oblivion is beyond anything we have right now, but for some reason an omnipotent artificial intelligence cannot manage to send clear transmissions to its servants on the Earth. - HAL was a character of 2001: A Space Odyssey, not a 2013 film starring Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman. - I got tired of the idea behind Oblivion halfway and just started hoping it would end. - As always, the enemies (this time drones) are incapable of shooting down a ship flown by a man, but somehow they can annihilate hundreds of humans in seconds. Also, they sound a lot like Tie Fighters. - Only Jack Harper knows this: there's actually a lush green portion of Earth which the AI didn't see, even though its main goal was to turn the Earth's water supply into energy using a series of fancy towers. - There are thousands of drones in the mothership, yet all the AI manages to send to attack the rebels three. After that it has to start thinking again. - With all the fancy DNA technology, how did the AI not know Morgan Freeman was aboard the ship Harper flew in? How did it not detect a massive nuclear bomb? Was it too busy concentrating on opening the pod bay doors? - M83's soundtrack began a lot like Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight Rises and ended up being too noisy. - The moon is destroyed. Wow, just like in Time Machine.In the end, Oblivion is a spectacle from the director of Tron: Legacy. It's his second film and it's obvious that the guy needs practice.

It was directed by the same crew that made Tron Legacy, so it was visually stunning. At least, on HD. This is one of those movies that should be watched in 4k theaters or at home in blu ray. I really liked the plot, although it featured Tom Cruise and his checklist of signature moves and contractual obligations. He did his usual scenes like flexing his short little body, the dramatic shower scene, riding a motorcycle(so we can be reminded that he's a biker and ""does his own stunts""), his ambivalent attitude, his confused twitchy eye glare, etc. The movie itself, was visually surreal in a very expensive looking way. The setting is not the usual post-apocalyptic wasteland we're accustomed to see in movies. Instead its a bleak, but natural looking landscape. The landscape is surrounded by dessert, sierras, snow, and futuristic architecture which were erected and terraformed by mysterious overlords called ""Titans"". Tom Cruise inhabits a Jetsons style sky home above the clouds with his partner who runs security operations for the ""Titan"", a hovering utopian space station. Below is the Earth's natural wasteland where most of the movie takes place. Cruise's character is supposed to be Titan's mechanical technician who maintains and repairs Titan's security drones that protect some hydro energy plants used to power the HQ's orbiting in space. Below, a conflicted Cruise starts meddling and stirs up trouble to create an action adventure movie. Its kind of Minority Report all over again. Cruise does his PG13 action scenes and we pretty much know where it leads to. This movie features some themes about religion and loneliness, but Cruise becomes a one man army and takes a dump on all of that. It even features a cruise solo shower scene. As if the one in ""Jack Reacher"" earlier in the year wasn't enough. Unlike Jack Reacher, this movie did not suck. Overall, its a good movie. I thought the whole mood of the movie was depressing(in a good way) and very stylish. Some of the things that ruined it, for me at least, was the corny costars Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman. I don't mean to hate on the guy, but he makes the movie very predictable and PG13. He usually gets his way at the end and saves the day, world, or whatever..... Im not saying that is what happens in this particular movie, but i mean we all know whats going to happen just by seeing Cruise in the movie trailer. Btw, there is supposed to be a twist in the end... or like halfway through, or third way into the movie or something so its not like a spoiled the movie or whatever. I just recommend watching this on Blu ray with a good HD TV in 1080p.",Oblivion
693,ttanerkaplan,Disappointment,3,30 April 2013,The reason that I watched the movie named Oblivion was me wanting to see Tom Cruise acting. . I am 22 years old and I never miss any of Tom Cruise movies in theater. While I was watching movie I figured it is going to be boring and not interesting. Since Tom Cruise is great actor I give him the chance and watched the movie till the end. I do not know anything about director or the writer. The thing that I know is they have no respect to older movies. But you can not fool a guy like me. This movie has exact same scenes The Matrix movie does. I could not believe when I saw human plantation I start laughing when I saw it.  Morgan Freeman was Morpheus and Tom Cruise was Neo really? why? . The Matrix movie was not the only victim. The Island movie was the other victim and you are going to ask me seriously!!! Yes 100 percent positive. The great question is where is the original ideas for new generation movies?,Oblivion
694,Ewe-misc,"Nice twist, but no tension",7,7 May 2013,"After a war with alien invaders, humans won, but the earth was nuked. Jack and his partner are in charge to maintain infrastructures that clean the earth in prospect of a future return of the species, while fighting remaining aliens that hide on the planet. They perform each day the same routine, living their mechanical existence in a bubble.Jack seems to have reminiscence of the life before the war. How can that be? In his dreams, a woman always appears. On day, a spaceship crashes on the planet and his dream turns reality. How come he knows her already? Is the reality he believes really the truth? The film depicts with a beautiful scenery the lone and cold existence of Jack and his partner in a post-apocalyptic planet. The reversal in Jack's reality is a nice plot.Unfortunately, despite its slow pace, the movie fails to develop the characters. Instead, it feels like an alternation of still photographs and actions-packed scenes, leaving little place for emotions.The movie also fails to develop a coherent unity, and progresses instead as a succession of deja-vu from other sci-fi movies.Finally, the movie implies that alien technology is in some way limited, and that they must exploit humans for certain tasks. Again, the movie fails to develop a coherent universe and the plot has numerous holes.I would recommend this movie only for CGI and design lovers.",Oblivion
695,vitam-499-152414,A Titan of a film! - with dark messages?,8,22 April 2013,"It is the writing of Oblivion IMO that steals the show. It is a film at its core that is examining what it means to be a human being. What more could one want? It is basically saying that with memory we are our identities. On the surface that could be trivially true - but at the deeper level the film is encoding the human+robot - a new type of existence. Can a robot or machine be programmed with a memory? Is that human? Well, according to Beech (Jack's missus) the memory is enough- enough to make him be her husband. And at the end, she smiles, even though the last lips she kissed have been nuclearized up in the sky-zone.Well...that's one interesting line within the film! There is also the idea that Jack's character is partly retarded. He drinks beer and played lots of sports - when the earth was alive and at war with the new-techs, but at the same time he is a ""Commander"" of an elite unit taking out the new-techs. This to me is contradiction with character - perhaps? But at the idea level, it is propaganda (of a sort) in that we (the audience) align with the beer drinking, the bassball, and - the fighting commander.I don't mean to be downbeat. Jack is a lovable character, and he has a love for music, and also a love for his wife. So, I will be watching this film again! So this is how I roll. I highly recommend this film - one of the best of 2013 so far!",Oblivion
696,Hal_Computer,"Spoiler-free review, the less you know the better you'll enjoy it",9,17 April 2013,"I really wanted to see this movie from the first time I saw the movie trailer a long time ago. I came up with all sorts of fun endings in my own mind based on the trailer and eventually my curiosity caused me to read too much and I read some spoilers that I wish I hadn't. I still enjoyed the film immensely, but wish I hadn't read the spoilers and suggest you shy away from all potential spoilers, reading as little as possible before seeing the movie. So when you're done with this review, don't read anymore, just go see the movie.I had the good fortune of watching this movie at an advance screening on a smaller IMAX screen and I really enjoyed it, as did the huge audience, judging by the lively and jovial banter as people exited. The movie follows Jack Harper who is a drone repair tech in a future earth that has been ravaged by an alien invasion. He has a by-the-books eye-in-the-sky (literally) assistant named Victoria (nicknamed Vika) who watches out for Jack and reports to Central. They live together in a sky platform to avoid the alien scavs who come out at night. Jack is keeping the drones repaired to defend huge energy machines from being attacked by the scavs. Once enough energy has been stored up from the world's oceans by the energy machines, the remaining survivors of earth hope to leave in a few short weeks for the safety of a new base on Saturn's Titan. To protect certain things, Jack and Victoria's memories have been erased before their present situation. Jack is confused about why they have to leave earth, whereas Vika is ready to go, but they both cherish and respect each other. Then Jack meets Malcolm Beech who tells Jack that things are not exactly how they seem, which sets off a series of events that eventually lead to the end of the movie.Some critics have mentioned something like ""we've seen these ideas before"" in other movies. While it's true that there's nothing totally new in this movie per se, that doesn't make the movie less appealing, IMO. Thinking back to when I was much younger and saw the trailer for the movie Independence Day in the theatre, I remember thinking that the movie looked really fun despite the fact that there've been a zillion alien invasion movies before, but I still hoped they'd do a great job with it because the trailer for the movie was awesome. Was there anything earth-shatteringly new about the movie? Not really, but it was still excellent entertainment. That's how I feel about Oblivion. To me, it's great entertainment.The only minor complaints I had was that the volume of the music while Jack and Vika were in the pool was too much and sometimes things dragged ever so slightly between action sequences. Overall though, this movie was definitely a remarkable treat.",Oblivion
697,a-strangename,"A prodigal effort toward ""suspension of disbelief""",5,24 April 2013,"In a time where big-budget eye poppers are finding their contextual (or lack thereof) footing along comes Oblivion to light the path forward. It is a movie you can watch with your eyes and guts without even once coming within sight of a threat to derail the experience with some clumsily groping attempt to fill in or justify one of the unavoidable plot holes that are such common currency this side of $100,000,000.In a truly water-shed moment, someone must have said, ""Screw this, lets just not explain it"" and repeatedly at that. Genius I say, which is why this gets a 5 instead of a 2. Apply this simple adjustment to a familiar formula means the deletion on such crowd-lamented features as 'lame comic-relief-guy, implausible chronologies and (my personal favorite) unaddressed conflicts. In oblivion you get to answer those questions yourself and because the action-y pace and visual appeal of both the movie and actors those questions are severely developmentally delayed. Unlike the creator of this thing, who managed to elevate suspension of disbelief to the level of sex; in that one enjoys the display, you move from one position to another before you know it and in the end you are limping, wanting more and ready for a nap before 'what just happened?' even enters the equation.-------TLDNR----------- In summation, this movie actually managed to suppress my higher brain function for the duration while tickling me in all the right non-brain places. Its vapid, pretty and intriguing. I hate that art and science are starting to produce viable offspring. I hate that I enjoyed this movie. Recommended.",Oblivion

Am getting a little tired of the motion picture industries constant need to use the Lords name in vain to create effect. I reviewed IMDb today before going to see it and there were no comments under Parents Guide relating to religious profanity. Was I ever shocked when three times I heard GD in this movie! Reviewed after seeing it to add to parents guide but noticed someone already and quickly had. I appreciate your site and always check it before wasting my money and time. In future I'll wait till after release day to ensure it doesn't happen again.More importantly, we need to send a clear message to the industry that they don't need to continue this practice especially in PG or PG-13 movies.

But now I feel that it has been a while since Tom Cruise has given a seriously good movie. This movie is again a very average film with a hackneyed plot. A few years back came a movie The Moon and this movie is very much similar to that movie in spirit and takes ideas from other movies. Taking ideas from other films is not bad as long as you are able to deliver a unique combination of them, but honestly this film failed to do so for me. The plot was very twisted and convoluted in the end and instead of making me think, ""what just happened?"", I ended up saying, ""let it happen, who cares"". So many times we have seen such twists with uninteresting endings. Same thing happens here.",Oblivion
700,GillianKazoo,Predictable?,8,28 September 2013,"I just wanna start of by saying that I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because the graphics, special effects, and animation was all done very well. But am I the only one who watched the trailer for this movie and basically knew almost everything that was going to happen? (WARNING: Spoiler ahead! Caution when reading if not wanting anything spoiled!)The only things I did not get from the trailer were that 1. The alien/ antagonist would be a floating cube thing, 2. That there would be clones or alternate universes of them (Jack Harper & Victoria or whatever), 3. That Jack Harper would die in the end, aka the main character dying...I thought the movie was creepy, entirely possible, and I thought it was kind of weird/ maybe stupid that they didn't let the drone with the bomb go, could it not fly? Like, why did they have to take it outside? Personally I thought after they put the nuke in that a hatch would open from above and it would fly out. So I don't know why all the drones had to come and people had to die and everything, probably because they needed to add more conflict, more drama and more time. And I got really confused because they didn't really make it clear what the clones/ alternate universes were all about, how Jack Harper is 'a weapon' / where he came from? Or how the conflict started? I'm not really sure what they were talking about at that point... Or why they ejected the people that were in deep sleep when they were entering the cube.... So overall I thought it was good, just creepy and confusing. If you've watched Oblivion, what were your thoughts? How did you like this movie?

This movie anyways, has a pretty good plot, and better yet; excellent animation. If I were to say anything myself, I gave this movie a 7/10, although I would've gone for 6.5 if I could have.

I kept watching hoping that things would improve, but they never did.

705,billagozilla,the SF movie I wanted to see !,8,15 November 2014,"I liked this movie !There are few SF movies out, recently, that can match Oblivion. Of course Gravity is one and it's even better, but I'm in doubt if calling Gravity an SF movie is correct at all, actually.Back to the point, Oblivion manages to assemble all the right components of a good SF movie, such as a credible futuristic plot and a nicely visualized technology, and enhance them with great photography and a cool soundtrack.The story flows linearly, with a very good balance of action and dialog and it is only towards the middle of the movie that the viewer, as well as the main character, recognizes that what he believed until then is just a lie.As simple as this narrative technique is, it is still very effective.The acting skills of Morgan Freeman feel a bit wasted on character that is not given enough space.The finale is a bit too much hero-stereotype. But this is somehow softened by the fact that the ultimate sacrifice by the main character is compensated by his knowledge that he will be replaced by his own clone. And that is a nice variation on the hero-will-die-to-save-everyone-else type of ending.And then...I like Tom Cruise when he's smiling.",Oblivion

707,ligiaruscu,"sf pic strong on f/x, weak on plot",4,14 April 2013,"where to even begin? 1. why not erase jack's memory entirely, while they were at it? he's lost his personal memories (and not even these thoroughly, as it turned out), but kept the generic memories of a member of the human race. if these had been erased also, the tet would have had to face no problem with his (their) loyalties, no problem with the fate of the earth, no need to pretend they were all relocating to titan etc. true, there would also have been no story. a loss? 2. this is a world that's supposed to be wrecked and destroyed, where most people have been dying of starvation. yet no one seems to have the slightest problem in procuring energy. a fellow on the run, tailed by two different sets of pursuers, will, as a matter of course, embellish the facade of his shack in the woods with bright lights. (American films don't do poverty very well, except for the purely visual. this reminds me of the young and otherwise quite watchable young actress playing rue in the hunger games, who was supposed to not have eaten for three days, and, when handed a chicken leg, daintily picked the meat off the bones. probably neither she nor her director had ever seen how a real starving person eats.) 3. a woman dispatched on what is essentially a maintenance job, where she will not be seen by anyone but her partner for weeks on end, will be outfitted exclusively with tight dresses and stiletto heels. nice to see that some things are not supposed to change in the future. 4. a person put into artificial sleep for sixty years will, on awakening, have not the slightest hesitation in efficiently using the new technology which she has not been introduced to. 5. someone on one of the boards here wondered how non-American viewers were supposed to relate to all the emotion surrounding the superbowl (or other purely American games). the answer is, you don't. though ""overseas markets"" are a welcome bonus, American films are made with American audiences in mind. 6. one tom cruise is quite enough for one film, but at least this we knew beforehand. two of them is definitely unfair.and that's just a few random thoughts. add the lack of depth of the characters, the mostly indifferent acting (poor morgan freeman!), the utter predictability of the plot, and what it amounts to is: go find yourselves a proper film to watch.",Oblivion

714,gkbuick,Fabulous !!!!,9,12 April 2013,"I saw Oblivion earlier this evening, not knowing much about it other than it was a science fiction film set in the near future starring Tom Cruise. I love sci-fi and generally enjoy Tom Cruise movies. When the movie started, I was immediately impressed by the visuals, the bleak landscape (which is quite disturbing) and the special effects. It takes a few minutes to get used to Tom Cruise in the role and the dialogue at first seemed pretty clichéd. So I watching this movie thinking, OK it looks great, but where can this movie go ? They are just there doing their job on the rig, he's explained what they are doing there, big deal ! But lets just say the movie experience improves exponentially as the film goes on, as the story becomes more complex and things begin to expand and make sense. I don't want to put any spoilers in here, but there was a point when I thought oh no, its gone too far now, this part doesn't make sense (after another patrol craft lands over the sand dune). For those who've seen it, you'll know which scene I mean. But then even that makes sense completely by the end too.Going into this movie totally unaware about any plot detail was the best thing, it made it so much more enjoyable. I was worried this film was going to be great to look at, but vacuous. That it certainly was not ! It was profound and stunning ! Tom Cruise is at the top of his game here and he definitely looks the part thoroughly. The love story is very believable and is quite deep and touching. I had a tear in my eye on more than one occasion. This film touches cleverly on the point that life is about memories, those you love and those you lost, not just about what you do and who you are. This resonated with me. The other main female role, his colleague is also great in her role. The direction, the tension, the sound effects, especially of the drones, are all fabulous. I really can't fault this film, apart from a few minor issues that I'm not going to bring up now ! 9/10, the best film I have seen in a long time.",Oblivion
715,dvdusi,Watch Moon instead!,1,13 April 2013,"Oblivion is a big budget turkey that I did not feel for, root for, relate to or enjoy from start to finish. Why, you may ask. And the answer is simple: because I have already watched this type of movie before, just far, far, far better than this poop Tom Cruise crapped out.Now, I am not a Cruise hater, I always look forward to his movies, but he delivers another major disappointment after Jack Reacher.The another movie I am talking about is Moon with Sam Rockwell. And that's because the two movies deal with the same subject. I think the main difference why Moon worked for me and not Oblivion is because the makers of Oblivion had such a big budget to spend that they just had to throw in everything to spend the money. A bit of heartless action, half baked suspense, a type of ""I am alone on Earth"" type of movie, except he is not (not a spoiler by the way), a bit of important plot references related to famous book quotes just to make the movie look like it has some kind of deeper meaning. The result, in my opinion, is that the film ends up being meaningless and direction-less. It does not know what it wants to be and that's why it felt like a torture to sit there and watch this. It promises something in one scene and then it builds your expectations, crushes them, and in next scene it decides to take another direction.But fortunately, Moon did not have a big budget to toy around with, so the makers had to keep it simple and boy, was it effective!I believe that the people who are praising Oblivion have not seen Moon. So I recommend to skip this one at the movies and rent Moon instead. You won't regret it!",Oblivion
716,Beno-17,A Hopeless Plot,3,13 April 2013,"Let me start by saying that the visuals in the movie are great, acting is reasonable, and although the general story is slow, it has a lot of potential. That is where the positivity ends. For me, the abundance of plot holes / inconsistencies completely ruined the film. Whilst some of these might seem like nitpicking, when you add them together it really detracts from what could have been a great movie. I was asking questions like;The machines seem to have amazing technology, except being able to keep consistent radio transmission.How did Jack and Victoria figure that their control centre / home was built with no humans? If by the machines, then surely the machines are capable of handling drone maintenance themselves, making their roles totally redundant?Why does the machine mother ship's communication go offline constantly?Why are the machines always short on drones?Jack has an obvious disposition toward protecting humans, yet the other humans constantly wear armor that make them seem non-human? There is ample opportunity to approach Jack whilst he makes repairs or is on his own.Despite Jack / Victoria's control center / home being somewhere in the stratosphere, it seems to have swimming temperature and calm wind conditions.Why does Victoria's character have her head completely in the sand, whilst Jack appears to be quite free-thinking?Why are the drone cameras not visible to the machine control? This would have exposed significant intelligence about the humans numerous times. It is standard even with drone technology today.How can the flight log still hear what the NASA flight crew are saying whilst they fly into the white light? If it was in the crashed ship then it must have been disconnected with the sleeping passengers (this is a clear error)?The machine mothership didn't consider that maybe Jack was smuggling something into the ship? Especially after it was clear he knew that they were not human?Broken drones are easily repaired with chewing gum.How did Jack build an entire home on the lake with no obvious access to building equipment or resources?The machines could scan Jack's ship upon entry (presumably by some sort of infrared) and see that there was another passenger, but were not able to distinguish a male from a female? Despite them at times being able to match Jack's DNA on visual recognition?In 2017 suspended animation seems to have been perfected?Why were Jack and Victoria due to go back to Triton in two weeks?The aliens seem to have not nailed memory wiping technology at all.I could go on and on, but this is just the tip of an iceberg for a truly ridiculous plot.",Oblivion
717,MDealer,I got lured into this,3,11 September 2013,"It's apparent that the writers skipped all science and math classes at school. Some basics were plausible and even interesting in the first 30min of the movie, but then it just goes downhill. 1h 30min for the resolution. That's not how you tell a story.Not to mention it glorifies science myths that have been proved wrong 50 years ago. The 'Tet' can't realistically be as dumb as it is.People, die or stop skipping science classes. Do us a favor. Water is useless for energy in Universal scale. There's nothing to do on Earth. Titan? Are you kidding me? That's the last place to go. I really looked forward to all the great ideas in the first 30min, but then was infinitely let down by ever dumber concepts.

718,rblaa,"naysayers are right, but I still liked it",8,29 September 2013,"Reading through the previous reviews, I find myself agreeing with the negative reviews in one sense, but still disagreeing overall. I walked away quite liking this movie.Most of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.Re stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.For me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.Given that theme, the movie's style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.Be careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.But still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.Sure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.To me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.But that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.Plus the drones looked really really cool.Re copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own. I saw and loved Moon (which granted is the better movie), but I enjoyed this one for what it was.I think it helped for me to not see any trailers, and to come in with low expectations after hearing about bad reviews.",Oblivion
719,bigstew,An effective blend of science fiction and popcorn entertainment,8,3 August 2013,"Oblivion mixes post-apocalyptic themes of human survival with science fiction ideas of artificially intelligent extra-terrestrial sentient machine(s). It turns out to be a moody yet fun and entertaining mash-up. In addition, the set and sound design are superbly done of great benefit to the film's narrative. Vast landscapes of the natural earth and the rubble of human civilization are fascinating to look at.

720,borjasupra695,If you haven't seen Oblivion... Don't be Oblivious,8,22 April 2013,"What can I say about oblivion. Is it the best movie I have ever seen? NO, does the story have holes? YES. Do any of these two questions affect how much I liked this movie? ABSOLUTELY NOT.After reading several reviews I have found that many people criticize this movie for having wholes in it's story. The only movies that I have been able to find without any ""wholes"" in it's story, are movies that are actually based on real events. Now don't misinterpret me, there are a few movies based on real events that have wholes. Why do I bring this up? well this movie in no way shape or form stated that it was based on true a factual events, hence having wholes it's almost a given. Now to why I think this was such a good movie. Even though it was not perfect and it has it's flaws, I was able to connect with several characters in the movie, specially Tom Cruise's character. How many times have we found out that things are not like they seem? how many times have we had to make choices without having perfect knowledge on the matter? How many times where does choices easy? How many times did those choices come with a a sacrifice and a price? Because I was able to see all those different details in Oblivion is the main reason why I enjoyed it so much.The movie is not perfect, neither are we, but that still makes us great.",Oblivion

The production values were high, which I always appreciate in any movie but especially in fantasy (sci fi, horror, fantasy proper). That's because I love special effects. The special effects were fine, but not much, quantity-wise.The story was fine, but draggy and possibly not as tight as it could have been. No one's acting was bad, but there was something... overdone... about the way guys kept nodding with approval to each other.

722,djrobwarner2,Leading film in the new sci-fi-fi genre,6,25 April 2013,"The quality of a sci-fi film is typically inversely correlated to the number of dark synthesiser stabs used. Oblivion almost succeeds in bucking this trend but then messes it up by borrowing too heavily from Wall-E,Moon and 2001: A Space Odyssey.The good parts of this film outweigh the corny but not by much. Tom Cruise is actually one of the saving graces of the film - his everyman vibe serves this sort of film well generally. Sadly the obvious borrowing of ideas from other well-known films undoes the potential this story had.Note: we get to see what Catherine Zeta-Jones looked like 30 years ago so it's not all bad.",Oblivion

The narration felt tacked on and uninspired. It seemed like everything in the film had a number assigned to it: sectors, drones, humans, etc. Number soup always sounded stupid in the dialogue.Also annoying thing is that the plot seemed to be cobbled together from many science fiction films (and books), making the film feel derivative.But other than that, it was pretty, had great sound, and the plot (while derivative) was intriguing and taut.

Mostly because I absolutely loved the idea of it, and the twists and turns were really wonderful, but everything was executed so poorly. Tom Cruise gave a horrible performance, which may have been the worst part of the film in all honesty. I was really counting on him to carry the film through plot holes & corny lines, but you can tell he really didn't believe in the film. A big reason I even wanted to watch this film was to see Jaime Lannister (Coster-Waldau), but his part was so minuscule and horribly written that it made me want to scream. Another big problem is that the real meat of the story is pushed way back into the latter part of the second half, with the first hour dragging on and on.",Oblivion

Think hard what movies from last year or the last few years live in your mind today (The Avengers, for me from last summer Star Trek reboot, Iron Man 1 and even Thor) But not remembered at least for me the last Batman, MI GP, Captain America This movie falls in to that group it was good just not remember-able.Part of the movie that worked really well is the love story. The movie used a very different plot line but played it out a bit slow. By time the story developed you were not riding along you were ahead of the story. Most people knew what was going to be said before it was said on screen. The tech used in the movie was great from the bubble ship to the control tower and the drones.

There are plot twists here that are really interesting, but you have to stay with it. The movie seems to start slowly, but it is really giving you important information that you do not realize is important yet. However it is worth the wait. On one level there is a lot of action in this movie to satisfy almost anyone. The look of the movie is great. But it does start seeming slowly and it seems like something you have seen before, but it is not. I highly recommend this. It has a great science fiction concept about humanity. I would explain this idea, but it would give away the movie. Hope you give it a try.",Oblivion
727,saallan09,Oblivion or Oblivious?,7,28 July 2013,"Oblivion or Oblivious? Well, the former is verging on the latter, it has to be said...I'm a big lover of science fiction, in its many forms. As a child I avidly read Asimov, Clarke and many more. I bought the first issue of 2000AD, the comic which introduced us to Judge Dredd. I'm sure it had a plastic spinning disc with three arms in the centre stuck to the front as a free gift... I once had a sew on arm patch from an Apollo mission and a poster for Revenge of the Jedi.That's right... I said 'Revenge'.As a movie addict, I devour the films. Whether it's 2001: A Space Odyssey,Star Wars, the X-Men films (I used to read their comics too), Event Horizon, Black Hole, I, Robot and more, I'd rush to watch and thoroughly enjoy being taken away to times and realities far from my own.I'm quite partial to most Tom Cruise films too. Action and adventure, thrills and spills, they all entice me. I wasn't over keen on the last Mission Impossible film, however. Great ideas and stunts, but should the gadgets go wrong? I don't think so. I love Simon Pegg, and he was great as the franchise's 'Q' character, but those gloves, the mask creator doodad and so on. Part of the essence of MI was the spectacular inventions as well as the non-stop action.Cruise was good in Collateral and I thought inspired in Rock of Ages. Rain Man is a classic (though Dustin Hoffman steals the film).2015, the Year of the Blockbuster brings us another outing from the Mission Impossible stable, but it has to go up against new iterations of Independence Day, Star Wars, Terminator, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Avengers, Finding Dory (Nemo), Fantastic Four, Jurassic Park, James Bond, Avatar, Hunger Games, Alvin & the Chipmunks (?!) and Inferno (Dan Brown). There's also slated a Warcraft film, Assassin's Creed, another Kung Fu Panda, the Penguins of Madagascar and possibly even a Prometheus 2! And breathe.Oh, and prepare my tent for camping out at the Parkway (my local cinema in Cleethorpes - great place!) So. I had high hopes, as Kodaline might say, of Oblivion. It's a bit of a surprise that I hadn't found myself watching it long before now, but life waits for no film, hence I didn't. So there. Last night I had chance of a quiet moment or two and decided, finally, to go for a bit of a Cruise.It started out slow. Probably, I thought, building the tension. Waiting for the huge climax. Interspersing the film with pathos and then flipping into explosions and stunts and breathlessness.After a while of not a lot happening, I interrupted my viewing for 20 minutes of the 30 Day Shred (day 4). I was certainly more breathless from this than anything Oblivion had thrown at me thus far. I then returned to the movie hoping things would pick up.They did, but they also didn't. I won't give anything away about the plot (I had my fingers burned when I accidentally let slip a very important fact regarding the wonderful Judi Dench's brilliant M portrayal in Skyfall - oops), but then, there wasn't much of one to give away.The various set pieces, for me, weren't big enough. They didn't draw out the tension and I couldn't find myself particularly feeling for the characters. I didn't fear the Predator lookey-like Scavs. Olga Kurylenko is decidedly lovely, though, but her performance was a touch wooden. I was disappointed with Morgan Freeman - something I could never imagine myself saying. Shawshank is one of my all time favourites. I thought he was a fab God in the Almighty films. I even liked him in Dreamcatcher. Unfortunately, his brief appearance in this left me cold. It was too predictable. It had been done too many times before.And we knew, didn't we, he'd go for that gun turret? There were many things that could have been built on, the events in the Radiation Zone for one. I thought many of the ideas were good, but none of this film was particularly new. And Independence Day 2 is coming out in a couple of years, please don't steal ideas from the first and then do them so blandly! I could go on, but this film did it for me (went on). It's a shame. The cast was good. The ideas were there, but they weren't developed.It was fine for a bit of entertainment, but just a bit. At the end, I asked myself if I'd enjoyed it, but couldn't really answer. I didn't NOT enjoy it, but that's not the same thing.The shower afterwards and a mind spinning through various aspects of Visual basic code I was trying to figure out helped me ease into sleep.Oblivion could almost have done that itself.",Oblivion

This is a caliber ""Sunshine"" by Danny Boyle with Cillian Murphy film. In fact Oblivion shares much with Sunshine. Their 3rd act is kinda lackluster whereas both films feature fantastic memorable scenes. The strength of this film is not it's story ; the story is there i assure you. The strength of this film lies in it's atmosphere, it's fantastic memorable orgasmic soundtrack with the fantastic visual landscapes. Tom Cruise is a great actor and has contributed much to the sci-fi genre. First Minority report and now Oblivion. Tom Cruise , you sir i may dislike you but oh boy at the same time i admire your acting. The film has nothing to do with the trailer and feels fresh compared to all the 80s remakes. After all Scifi films are beginning to rise once again to Hollywood after a long time. This is not a film where action is the orientation, forget michael bay boring uninspiring stuff.

It also took them 3 years to find Jacks cabin in the woods? I thought the scavs were ""watching"" Jack all the time and you would have thought they would know where he takes hours and hours break to relax and chill out.

In the end , I felt many questions as, how, why, again how.

731,OnZa,Not quite there yet,6,20 April 2013,"Oblivion is a beautifully shot movie. That all can be seen in the trailer already. The overall story is quite good also, and acting is satisfactory. This is mainly a Tom Cruise solo movie and the character feels like it's TOM CRUISE all the way. I did not feel at any point that this person was actually Jack Harper. That is the same problem with Tom Cruise and Will Smith lately.Acting obviously is a big part of a movie (especially one with as scarce amount of personnel as this one) but all other aspects are equally as important. Like said there are many good pieces here but they are not connecting perfectly and well-thought out story has gaps in it's little nuances. Also, many plot turns are sourced from classic scifi movies with some variation.It's not really easy describing the story of the movie without spoiling anything so I wont do it. People will be better of reading the general description and just go and view the movie themselves. In regards of similar content to this film I think ""The Moon"" by Duncan Jones was overall success. Still, this was not a bad movie by any means, but it was unfortunately not a memorable or great one either.

Seems like world is going to end in few months...probably by end of Summer by looking at the release calendar :( AS name suggest I was in total state of Oblivion while watching this movie. It's a story of two person trying to extract earth resource to keep their world functional until they realize they are just serving aliens to steal earth resources. Also there is a underground communities of human being living as some creatures headed by Morgan Freeman. Movie has few moments but otherwise this is a totally flat movie with hardly any twists.

You can notice what I'm talking about in Oblivion and also in his recent sequel movie, TRON: Legacy. Kosinski is missing that attention grabbing direction in his dialogue scenes. All that he provides during those scenes are the beautiful visuals on the screen but, even those are not enough. When the action sequences do come along, Kosinski does a great job visually and also an awesome job thinking them out. Even though there isn't much action in Oblivion, they are very visually stunning sequences, even in TRON: Legacy. Another thing that I disliked about this movie is the looong beginning that dragged on for too long. There were many scenes that I found were just extremely boring and dragged on. There were also many scenes that I think could have been made better (for example, when Jack goes down the hole to repair the destroyed drone.) Overall, this movie was filled with amazing visuals and a great, original story, I just feel like it could have been executed a lot better. But at the same time, I feel like other directors couldn't have brought on the emotional feelings that came with Kosinski's directing (for example, the hidden valley that Jack discovers.)

737,KenLG,Beautifully rendered and executed movie,9,19 April 2013,"I'll admit I'm a bit biased because I've got a lot of love for the style and cinematography Joseph Kosinski and Claudio Miranda brought to Tron Legacy and this film.Because of that, the film is beautifully done from production design to cinematography to the soundtrack. I won't go into the plot beyond noting that there's a twist. May not be a major spoiler but for some it might.I'm becoming a fan of Mr. Kosinski because he manages to tell a great story with a mix of the visual with concise dialog. He unfurls the plot and story with what seems like a measured and experienced hand. It's a combination of a great director and a solid team working with him.I know some people felt parts of Tron Legacy were hokey or just not really solid but don't let that keep you from seeing this piece. It's a very different movie in that Tron Legacy allowed for some silliness because--I feel at least--the source material allowed for it. In this case, Oblivion is based on an unpublished graphic novel that Mr. Kosinski put together with Andree Wellin and Arvin Nelson. It's not exactly a Disney movie. I admit I was a bit worried about Tom Cruise in the lead but he plays it well and in the end convinced me the character fit him like a glove. The other actors put in good performances but the majority of the screen time goes to our hero and Andrea Riseborough who plays Victoria and acts more as a foil to Mr. Cruise--an indicator that that perfect looking facility and their lives may not be as perfect as one initially expects.And even if you're not a fan of sci-fi, you shouldn't necessarily skip this. The story is more of a human story with the sci-fi being a vehicle to paint the picture, so to speak. The plot twist may or may not blow your mind (well, maybe not blow it) but this isn't Inception. :)I loved this film.

These kind of films really cheese me off because the invariable accompaniment to this is a dead awful, dumbed-down plot. Think Independence Day.Oblivion isn't Independence Day. It's up there with Sunshine, Solaris and Prometheus. If you get bored by complexity or seriousness or lack of non-stop action, don't bother seeing it.There were a couple of very minor questionable areas of the plot but nothing that couldn't be feasible in context.I highly recommend Oblivion.

Why would there be only two. Am I meant to believe that during the entire war with the human race it never go the chance to grab a few other genetic samples for cloning purposes.

741,kitschyduck,A Science Fiction Remix That Borrows From The Best,7,13 August 2013,"I don't like Tom Cruise. Therefore I didn't think I'd enjoy this film. Annoyingly, despite all the plot holes (that can be filled with a little imagination and some suspended disbelief in my opinion), an overly cheesy intro and borrowed aspects of at least a dozen other sci-fi movies, I really, really liked it. Some reviewers on IMDb seem to think that taking the best ideas from other science fictions is a bad thing, but I found these 'tributes' quite fun to look out for. Think of Oblivion as a Sci-fi remix. The alien TET with it's soft-spoken voice and ominous red light was very obviously reminiscent of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even Glados from the Portal video games. The drone design strongly reminded me of Portal's Wheatley also (along with their transformation from good guys to bad guys). Inspiration certainly came from Matrix in the form of human 'pods' and a Zion-like colony of rebel humans trying to survive underground trying to use the machines against themselves. There was a scene not unlike Independence Day when Tom Cruise cruises into the giant space inside the 'mothership' above Earth through massive doors under the pretense that he won't be setting off a bomb from the inside. And let's not forget the clone twist already perfected by Star Wars and Moon. Have fun trying to find the many, many other slices of plot and design extracted from all the best sci-fi movies ever made.With a musical score that makes you think 'I'm going to buy this album when this movie is finished' and CG effects that remain utterly convincing throughout, I think it's certainly worth a watch even to just discuss any plot holes or stolen ideas.

The plot is predictable but at least the science behind it is plausible unlike many other sci-fi movies. Action scenes are very well-executed and the sound effects are top notch. Anyone that doesn't like this movie likely shouldn't be watching sci-fi as the back-story and science is elementary for anyone with a scientific background.Tom Cruise is one of my favourite actors and is very convincing in his role as part of a ""clean-up"" team on earth. I wish he would do more sci-fi as he's great in these kind of roles. Andrea Riseborough is also very good as the other member of the team. Olga Kurylenko was an unnecessary addition and the film goes downhill somewhat when her character is introduced.The CGI and picture quality is stunning; some of the best seen so far.

As the movie goes on, EVERY single thing that you were told during the intro is basically explained again. This kinda ruins the movie a little bit. If Tom Cruise's character looked up at the destroyed moon I'd be like ""What the hell happened there?"", and this could have been explained in a clever way throughout the movie. But no, he's already told me why the moon is like that, so let's just get on with the story.The story itself is OK, and the ending is maybe the best part, even though it's far from excellent.What saves this movie is maybe the action scenes and the visual effects.

The story can be pretty confusing for some until the very end, or until (lets say) your buddy explains to you what the purpose of the story was. It takes away from the film that the viewer isn't really getting what the story is all about. Needless to say, the story is pretty interesting, just a little all over the place and not enough explanations. (I guess you would say ""plot holes""?) On a plus side, it leaves room for interpretation. What really saved this film was the visuals and the amazing soundtrack by Anthony Gonzalez! Sci-Fi films are meant to shine the brightest in the ""Visuals"" field and Oblivion manages to succeed with flying colors (literally). The soundtrack is easily one of the best of the year, and to keep it nice and simple, the music in the film will allow you to feel like you're in a whole different world (I'll also note that the soundtrack is worth the buy on iTunes. Oblivion stands out in the crowd with it's extreme visuals, great acting, and enchanting soundtrack! 9/10 for me! (Yeah, the visuals are that good!)",Oblivion

It tries to disguise itself as a trick for the mind, but I've already seen Moon, I already know the plot, the twist and the ending.This was little but a remake of Moon, with some action scenes added to pad out time. I was sitting here hoping the twist would be that he was not a clone, but he was himself, just to get one thing different from Moon, but nope. The only difference I found between this and that movie was that this one had those awful white, clinical rooms that people nowadays confuse with futuristic... It looks more like toilets than futuristic living spaces.",Oblivion
749,JonDoe00,7 Stars? Really?,7,26 February 2014,"I cant believe how powerful mindless ""just bleed"" movies are, god forbid a Film comes along that actually gives you something to think about. A movie about Giant Space Alien robots that ""Transforms"" into stuff banks billions, yet Oblivion, a Film that actually has a story and a message gets a 7 star rating...? What is considered a good a film to the IMDb masses? Pulp Fiction? Top 10? Lord of the Rings top 10? It was OK.. but top 10? really? Trolls and Hobbits go figure. ""Zombieland"" ranked a 7.8, a movie that I could not finish, filled with cheap Hollywood laughs, typical and as mindless as they come gets a 7.8? A robot cartoon is now on the 4th sequel and people keep buying it? I mean seriously, am I missing something? American Beauty imo is a top 10 Film but is outranked by Django? Another typical shoot em up cheap mindless ""just bleed"" movie. ""A Beautiful Mind"" a stellar Film is not even top 100 and is outranked by ""Up"" a cartoon...? lol... What a joke. This Film is excellent and is by far and away much more entertaining than a Robot that turns into cars movie. If your thing is cheap typical played out Hollywood thrills than this Movie is NOT for you. If you have any types of independent thought and is not influenced by what other people say than give this film look. Its interesting and compelling maybe even plausible.9 stars easy. Also, Olga is always good eye candy, that women stays cute, 30's and still adorable ... love her",Oblivion
750,AimadBeddouza,"Combination of Outstanding Performance, Visual Fffects and Originality gives you the best of the Sci-fiction genre",10,30 April 2013,"After seen this movie, I decided to divide it to three aspects before i review it.OK! let start with the story. so, the movie start and i was with it on line, till the half of it or more a bit, and at that moment everything start to change, i'm not gonna tell you what has changed exactly, so not to break the suspense, but i wasn't expecting that the story line will go further than what i was expecting after seen the trailers before the movie kick-off in theaters, trust me at that moment, it will make you to stick to the screen and give the movie more attention than before, even if you have to go to pee, you'll stuck it and ask: oww! hold on a second, what's going on exactly? Now let's jump to the dramatization and performance of the cast, Tom Cruise (Jack) as always gives the best of what he got and he got a lot, so no doubt he did what he had to do to make the movie worth to watch, i mean he lead everyone else to give outstanding performance in this movie. Andrea Riseborough (Victoria), well! she kills it, i mean she gave i think her best performance till date, I've never seen her before in any other movie, this is the first time i know about her and i was blown by her performance. Morgan Freeman (Beech) like any other movie i think he give the same level of performance every time i saw him, in this movie he did what he had to do to help the hero to achieve his goal. Olga Kurylenko (Julia) she gave what she could give, i mean she didn't kills it but she helped the hero to achieve his goal.Then comes the third aspect, it's really stunning visual effects, i mean if there's an original story like this one, you have to handle it and give it a nice looking face, for this movie that's what happened, and because it's Joseph Kosinski who directed Tron: Legacy, the guy knew where he have to look to give such a take breathing visual effects.Ultimately, I was really blown away, and for such a great Sci-fiction movie i encourage people to dig deep in this genre, because there's a lot to be found, and i highly recommend this movie to the ones who got big imagination... others who never liked sci-fiction don't knock this movie door!",Oblivion
751,thewickedjon,Awesome movie,9,19 April 2013,"This movie is an all around cult classic.It takes some of its best ideas from previous sci-fi iterations such as moon, 2001 a space Odyssey , total recall , Prometheus, heck I think it's got some mass effect(video game) going on as well.Although the story elements are composed of old ideas, the way they are put together around the main character make for an excellent departure from the typical sci-fi scene.**Beware of the mid-movie plot twist!!**The visuals & audio are fantastic, and the music is very adequate. The lead actor is superb as always. The overall cast, although very limited (almost no humans)get the job done.Sadly, due to the fact that some ideas are recycled ,or previously seen, the movie will leave an overall feeling that it is lacking originality.

752,trjack1,Great but could have dropped a couple of unnecessary bits,8,18 April 2013,"From the get go you know that something crazy has happened to our planet. You're wondering what has caused all the devastation and where all the people have gone. Some of this is answered early on but there's plenty to keep you guessing right up until the end when some of the big questions are answered. This helped me stay engaged as I tried to pick up on clues throughout the movie. Even after it ended I still was left wondering about a few things. I like a movie that makes me think.Cinematography and visual effects were breathtaking. Good mixture of scenes showing mass devastation and others showing the beauty our planet has to offer. The flying contraption that Jack (Tom Cruise) flies around in is pretty dynamic - looks like a futuristic pod type helicopter. There are some great scenes in this - again, a mixture of breath taking shots up in the clouds but also some fast paced action scenes. Makes you want to own one!On the downside, there was a raunchy seen towards the beginning that wasn't at all needed (movie could have been good for older kids/young teenagers) and use of the F word was totally unnecessary near the end. For me, the film lost its finesse with these baser elements.These 2 'bad bits' aside, the rest of the movie was really enjoyable, exhilarating, and had me guessing all the way along.",Oblivion
753,jacob_44-558-834207,epic,7,26 April 2013,"Personally, I don't really like Sci-fi movies, i loved this one though. Epic storyline, really pulls its audience more and more into the movie. It did get boring at times, I felt as though some of the events were really slow-paced, but really great overall. The visuals were stunning, gave out a really nice theater experience, acting was pretty much flawless, really enjoyed it as a whole. The thing i liked about it the most though is how it gets your attention and holds on to it for the whole 2 and a half hours or so. How the events make you think and wonder about what the hell is going on, twisting the storyline at some points making it totally unpredictable, not a lot of movies can do that. So yeah, in a nutshell, i really enjoyed this movie, didn't include spoilers so those who haven't seen it could read this, get up and watch it. I strongly recommend Oblivion to whoever likes a good theater experience.",Oblivion
754,RPI_engineer,A Pleasant Sci-Fi Film but falls short of Legendary Greatness,6,23 April 2013,"To the person that wrote ""Entertaining but no way a Masterpiece.."" - I couldn't agree more. Just like Prometheus, The vast landscape scenery at beginning and throughout is marvelously breathtaking, and can easily distract us from its major flaws. While the majority of the story made sense, I found the plot rather flat and disjointed with many parts hardly explained. Much about the command center remains unclear with the cloning scene not fully explained. Even though the cloning scene and others are an influenced by other Sci-Fi works that doesn't mean they don't need to be fully explained (What about those who do want many other Sci-Fi epics?). Most disappointingly though, Oblivion does not bring any unique element to the table, it does not carry its own legend - and thus is not a Masterpiece. As for the acting, quality varied throughout the cast. Cruise carried Jack Harper well to the end, and the same goes for Morgan Freeman (in fact, I understand when someone says that Oblivion was a waste Freeman given his flat plot in such a shallow plot line). Kurleyenko however, was only disappointing; even with a flat character lead she hardly her face was emotionless most of the time. Even with the beautiful scenery and well-filmed shots, Oblivion and other Sci-Fi films should not be excused from adequate plot and character development. Its not like critics and viewers will never fathom",Oblivion
755,norero,Excellent and brilliant,9,27 March 2013,"Last night I had the fortune of being in the world premiere of Oblivion in Argentina and see it with Tom Cruise in person in the Theatre,The film is entertaining and the many drafts of the script is very well led by Joseph Kosinski, Cruise is the perfect job, as well as that of Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman.The visual effects are outstanding, using a method of illumination and image overlay replacing the green screen.The plot, besides presenting a few small holes, which are imperceptible catch the beginning of the film until the final climax. Perhaps the presence of the same Tom Cruise and Olga Kurylenko in the room has boosted the expectations a bit to see this film, or how to analyze it, but the general public went very satisfied of the last jobs I've seen Cruise, this is certainly one of the best without a doubt, the story takes science fiction to another level, what would you do if the fate of your race depended on your memories? Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) is one of the last mechanical drone for Earth. It is part of a massive operation aimed at extracting vital resources after decades at war with the terrifying threat of Scavs. But Jack's mission comes to an end. Walk and patrol the sky thousands of feet until your ""high"" existence collapses when a beautiful stranger rescues a ship demolished. His arrival sets off a chain of events that will force Jack to question everything he knows and you end up putting the fate of the human race in their hands. My final opinion is that it is a successful work of Kosinski, based on his own book, and good entertainment, it's the end of the day what a viewer will find the movies",Oblivion
756,bengtsson71,Great movie with amazing visuals,10,10 April 2013,"I have been expecting this film for a long time now. And tonight when I finally got to see it I was not let down. The film features absolutely stunning cinematography, a great cast and a very good story. This is not the color booming flick like for an example Avatar was, this is a darker more adult film in many ways. The cast performance is superb and I must say that the performance of Andrea Riseborough is at the very best. The first half of the film is great and exciting, the second half is somewhat predictable though and therefore not as exciting. But all in all i would definitely recommend this film. It could possibly be one of the best films of this year.",Oblivion

Its like the writers have taken the loose pages of 2001 a space odyssey, Star Wars and perhaps Whalley?,threw them up in the air together, picked them up randomly and used them as the screen play. The plot is very poorly explained making the film very hard to follow. The story was more of a shoot 'em up computer game than a sci fi movie. If your concentration wavers for a second, you haven't a clue who is who or where they are or when it is happening. Effects are good with a lot of speed scenes and explosions.

I don't think I missed any of the recipe. Maybe a little Tron Legacy for the styling that isn't almost directly from 2001. I almost forgot WaterWorld for the collection of trinkets of the life that used to be.I liked it, even though it was Tom Cruise. They copped out with the use of the ""F"" Word at the end. It could have been so much more eloquent, even a ""See you in Hell, Sally"" would have been better.

760,seizethehappiness74,"120 million dollars for a remake of Moon, Space Odyssey, Independence day and Predator masks",5,13 April 2013,"I love Science Fiction movies. But I love them when they create some revolutionary steps in the genre. In this acclaimed movie ""Oblivion"" all I see is the scenes and parts from other science fiction movies like; Moon, Space Odyssey, Independence day, Predator and some others. I am disappointed; I had so high expectations about the movie before I watched but now it really hurts. Esp. When there is Tom Cruise you expect to see a flawless scenario however there are some logical mistakes and holes in the scenario. Before I talk about the holes I like to say that it is a visual feast but when you jump to scenario you will feel that lack of logic in the movie.First thing that disturbed me, is: the ship that Tom Cruise used can be directed by one finger movement to the base by his team mate ( if there is an emergency ). But when it comes to aliens they can't call back the ship they created back to base this is such a big conflict and mistake in the scenario. If you create a movie with 120 million dollars you should be more careful while you are writing the script and scenario.The second thing that disturbed me; On the last scene of the movie when Tom Cruise fools the Alien Ship of that artificial intelligence pyramid; the machine says to him that ""Jack, you are telling me a lie your heart beat is so high"" but when it comes the inside of that little transfer coffin that his ship carries, artificial intelligence can not recognize that the body belongs to Morgan Freeman and accepts them inside, sees no threat. Come on come to your senses and think logically you are not fooling little kids here you should come up with a better idea when you write a good, flawless script and something new.And the others; - Why does Tom Cruise""s team mate wear high heels on the base ? or is it just a marketing strategy of the movie ?Why does the Alien ship resemble with the same symbol on US dollar""s ?Why Jack""s wife can not remember who he is after she awakens from her sleep ? Why does she keep herself in a silent mode ? If I had seen my wife/husband I would try to communicate with her/him.What is the Alien agenda ? To create more drones or more Jack Clones with his team mate clones ? They just create fusion energy for what ?After Jack saves his wife and the crew of the space ship how does the rest of the space ship stay on the orbit of earth for 60 years without being noticed by the aliens ? If I was an alien and come to conquer earth I would control and check everything around the earth. Why does not Jack try to speak and ask some questions to the clone of himself when they saw each other ? He must attack him and capture him without asking questions yeah right :)After getting injured by the gunshot how can Jack""s wife heal so fast ? He just does some surgery there ( which we can not see in detail ) and then all of a sudden she wakes up from the bed and she becomes healed with her abdomen area. How does Jack use electricity on his ""earth home"" ? Lights all lamps at his home like there is an exhibition or a party at home and plays music. Earth is attacked by the aliens right ? So there should not be any power source right ? Why is there only drones at the mother ship ? Can""t the aliens capable of building some other soldiers or ships with their amazing technology ? Why does the alien population only consist of drones ? You attack to earth with drones and you don""t have anything more to attack or defense yourself with ? They produce human needs ( a swimming pool, a luxury home, everything a human being may need ) I mean every detail but when it comes to themselves they just produce drones which make weird monstrous sounds. Why there is no other mechanism or population there which belong to Aliens ? If they build everything where are those damn builders ? There is only drones that attack. It is clear that they can""t build something I mean they can""t even fix themselves :):)Why does all the teams ( Jack and his team mate ) alone ? For example they can chose to have a baby. Why do all the clones have to act the same ? They are not robots. Their decisions in life may be different.All I can say is that this movie made me disappointed. It is just another clone (oops I said clone*) of some other science fiction movies.Give us something revolutionary Hollywood !!! Don""t repeat yourself and let the writers write a good script !!! Let the directors direct a flawless film with no holes in the script And I think actors and actresses should be able to see that there are some flaws at the script and they should able to tell about the flaws about the movie and change the scenario !!! This is the last status of Hollywood; they just create movies like a factory without looking deeply to the movie. As a viewer I can see those mistakes how can""t they see it as a director, as a producer or as an actor/actress ? It is their job to do that !!! They earn money from shooting/acting on movies.I hope Tom Cruise""s next science fiction movie ( ALL YOU NEED IS KILL ) will not be a disappointment like this one !!!",Oblivion
761,FilmEspen1990,"A modern Sci-fi that delivers, but drags out a bit too much.",7,13 April 2013,"Many probably thought they had this movie figured out from the trailers, but oh boy many of them don't. I thought i had it figured, and that the trailers spoiled to much, but i was wrong.The story takes a bit time before it is fully explored, but when it reveals itself it works. Oblivion delivers a true and smart sci-fi story that explores themes of humanity, and the confusion of not having all the information. Since i don't want to spoil anything other then this, i'll cut short here.The acting is good, and it's especially pleasing to see that Tom Cruise is still a top notch actor (after War of the World, i was kinda nervous to see him in a alien invasion movie again.) Morgen Freeman is also a strategically good choice when it comes to explaining the deeper plots in the movie.The special effects are also excellent, and there is many stunning visual shots of the post apocalyptic earth. The drones and technological parts are also beautifully visualized, and is a perfect match with the ravaged background.The movies biggest problem for me is pacing. At times it is slow. Unbearably slow. Because, let's be honest. Oblivion is a smart movie, but it's not THAT smart. It's not the kinda movie where the audience should require 20 minutes for something to sink it, yet that is mostly what you get. After every major reveal, there is like 20 minutes of dragging out, before the story progresses. Also, the only part the movie does NOT stress to drag out, is the ending. This is a huge mistake, because i instantly fell in love with what was reveal to be the main antagonist.All in all a strong 7. It's not perfect, but it has a lot strong points.",Oblivion

It turned out quite different this time. I've always been a fan of Sci-Fi movies. And this was no exception. It brought me back movies like I,Robot, Titan A.E. and The Planet of the Apes (original).The best of this movie is that it will only keep getting better and better, you will love it all the way through the end. It's originality is beyond anything I've watched for the past 5 years. You won't regret watching this movie, it's a great experience. It's not just another action movie, It has great sci-fi elements, and it has a lot of potential for a sequel.After a second time I learned many things that weren't clear the first time I saw it, and I found out elements of even more Sci-Fi classics, like War of the Worlds, Independence Day, and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.

763,cesar-velandia,"Nice movie, sensible sci-fi",10,11 May 2013,"""The Earth is a memory worth to fighting for"", is the premise that leads the science fiction movie ""Oblivion"". Oblivion, which gives its name to the film, refers to the process of planet earth loss as a result of a war against alien agents. Yet despite the utter desolation, the memory lives on, even in the genes of the agents land protagonists of the story. The memory, put in images, in love content, a return to the homeland, to books, to hard rock of the 70s, to evoke revives the essence of life that we keep in the background somewhere: brain , soul or heart or whatever you want to call it, the story moves in those sensitive areas where refuge for harassment usually the outside, either in the depth, or in the reading of the book of poems, is hearing this aria that we transports and leads us to that place we only know and no one else can enter. That place unique sensibility activated and only occurs in the perfect place. , at any stage of things, the future or the past, history exemplified in these lines, is about memory intrinsic notion of the earth as paradise lost even longer longs the death of civilization. Humans no longer inhabit the planet. The earth is reduced to a minimum. The moon was destroyed and dominates the landscape like a trail of fragments Selenites. There heritage, architecture and monuments are remnants almost evaporated. The only solid that remains is the memory of the terrestrial installed in genes cloned to satiety, but reluctantly, never lost its essence, expressed in the most basic feelings: love, nostalgia, memory, emotion . The last emotion perceived memorable and printed to the core of memory. For this I recommend this film proposal of an impeccable, endowed with a concept of pure entertainment, no major ambitions, which pays tribute to a classic of science fiction: 2001 A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick. The last ship to the latest human to orbit the earth and returns after 60 years is called ""Odyssey"" and at the end, not to spoil the function to those who have not seen, omnipresence reminds alien Hal 9000, the computer that is rebels against the rational domain of human DNA. The story is based on a comic or ""graphic novel"", not yet published, which once again confirms the power of the graphic arts that enrich the scripts and storyboards twenty-first century cinema. And proves once again that the formula: hero, heroine, eternal love and fight to the death for an ideal, are and will remain a motivation to continue going to the movies and dream of epic fiction, get us out of the harsh reality.",Oblivion

The story makes you think one thing but then later it turns out to be another. The stunning visual effects has minimal flaws. As the story goes on, you get a feeling to the characters. Some you feel hatred towards and others you feel compassion for. Tom does a good job at being curious and at the same time oblivious towards life and everything. It is one of those films that you have to watch more than once to capture all the effects and the story time twists and turns.

766,JohnL11,A visually wonderful adventure,7,7 October 2013,"If you are a fan of spectacle and fun science fiction, Oblivion is the movie for you. While it isn't a masterpiece of cinema, it is highly entertaining, a fun ride, and never lets the audience down.I went into Oblivion with a relatively open mind. I had seen trailers for it months ago, but it looked like a mindless action movie/summer blockbuster, which is not my favorite genre at all. Hence I didn't know anything about it except that Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman were in it. Now that I've seen it, I can honestly tell most other movie goers that it is a wonderful ride. It has everything you could hope from an action movie: plot twists, adrenaline rushes, mystery, good acting, and just enough explosions to be awesome but not overdone.The biggest problem with the movie is that there is a rather pointless narration for the first few minutes. Narrations are one of my biggest film pet peeves. If I wanted someone to read to me, I'd get a book on tape—surely there are a million better ways of presenting exposition in a film. In fact, most of the information in the narration is presented within the next twenty minutes, and Oblivion would perhaps gain from forcing the audience to form connections implicitly. While talking about story, it may help to point out that the plot is not the main focus of Oblivion. Unfortunately, the story seems almost incidental to the sheer spectacle. Yes there are a few plot twists, but they are mostly predictable, especially to experienced sci-fi fans.But the sheer spectacle is certainly something that Oblivion does right. From start to finish, it is visually stunning. One gets a genuine feeling of awe when swooping over beautiful vistas, or through ruined cities. With so many beautiful shots of nature, the man-made props and sets are given a high standard, but they are equal to the task. Equally dramatic is the musical score, which conveys a sense of adventure and drama, and occasionally soars into emotional territory. Few dramatic action films manage to be pure entertainment without resorting to semi-comedic one-liners, and over the top action highlighted by overblown CGI, yet Oblivion pulls it off. It never takes itself too seriously, but also never feels forced.While nothing extraordinary, Oblivion is a more than decent film that fully lives up to its own promise. Hardcore movie buffs may be disappointed by the lack of originality, but no one who can kick back and enjoy the ride will be disappointed.",Oblivion

As a ""die hard"" sci-fi fan, I didn't even watch the ""new"" Star Wars episodes, full of crappy CGI and foul screenplay. But this, I'd watch over and over and over again. This movie forces you to want to be one of the occupants in the world it depicts. Of course it has it's knick-knacks, which movie doesn't? If you look deep inside, you will find discrepancies that could be an excuse for the professional critic. But everyones who delves into the movies world of fantasy would skip most of the flaws and enjoy it instead. My favorite sci-fi for the past 10 years.",Oblivion

773,kieran449,A unexpectedly really good movie.,10,8 March 2014,"Without revealing any spoilers, I saw this movie ""out of the blue"". Never saw a trailer (I still haven't). I remember hearing the name of the movie and completely forgot about it, and just decided to take a chance and watch it on cable TV one night. It is a Sci-Fi movie with a human heart, so you don't need to be a science fiction fan to enjoy it. Also, I am not a Tom Cruise addict, but he does a great job in his usual way. In fact, all the actors portray their characters very well.There is mystery, action, a little bit of love, and some adventure. The beginning is good, there is a high point, and the ending of the movie is satisfactory in my opinion. The special effects are executed in a way not to take away from the story or the plot, and the story does not revolve around them, but rather they are just a part of the story. If you are looking for a good movie to watch, I have to say it is well worth the viewing, not too predictable. Sit back and relax, you'll enjoy this gem.",Oblivion
774,dwarvenbarbarianrage,Very slow moving and unoriginal,1,11 October 2013,"As a huge fan of science fiction I was so very disappointed by this movie, especially because so many have said it is a good movie. There was very little plot and it was incredibly slow moving so much so that I wanted those 2 hours of my life back. Nothing made up for just how dull and unoriginal this movie is and I love Morgan Freeman's acting. I was not shocked or surprised by anything except how glossy and unrealistic it all looked. The concept might have worked well in its original form as a graphic novel or even a short film but there really wasn't enough there to make it worthy of 2 hours.

Also, it makes you appreciate your home planet much more and keeps you in a restless state of mind all the way.

However, some missing pieces and confusion ended up sealing Oblivion's fate as just that- a very good, not great, movie.First of all, the plot was very complicated- while all of it fell into place at the end, the confusion I felt for nearly half the movie ended up being the biggest concern for me. The plot had ridiculous amounts of thought and time put into it, which allowed me to appreciate it at the end. I mean, this plot was ridiculously well-thought out: Aliens attack and destroy earth. Jack Harper's mission is to ""clean up"" before abandoning earth forever to join the rest of humanity on the Tet. However, it turns out the aliens are actually humans, Jack is actually a clone, and the Tet is an evil planet-destroying being. Jack, and his fellow astronauts, were swallowed up by the Tet except for Julia. Through a series of circumstances, Jack meets Julia and remembers their relationship. Jack, learning that he is a clone, bands together with the remaining humans to destroy the Tet, sacrificing himself and providing Julia with a new Jack- the clone he had beaten earlier.The graphics, cast, and ideas were all there- director Joseph Kosinski just got too caught up in the plot for this movie to be a success.",Oblivion

Ohh, and the ideas...... lets send a drone up to blow them up.....giz you needed like 50 years to figure that out??And then the mastermind Jack comes up with the idea to just drop in because they where anyways invited. Why? because it seems the Tet was so curious to meet another human (got bored half a century with all those Jacks and Victorias) that it invited them up for a cup of coffee.

I've been a Cruise fan for years but that one really, really got my back up. So much so that I have decided not to buy any more Lee child books and was seriously considering boycotting anything with TC in it (oo, get me!). My girlfriend and I though, are both sci-fi fans and we got the Apple TV thing a while back. So access to films through iTunes/Netflix etc is pretty easy. This Oblivion movie came up and I had heard the visuals were amazing etc etc and the trailer I had seen and it looked interesting. But TC is in it. And TC let me down with the whole Jack Reacher thing! So we ummed and aahed and weighed it up and eventually I thought what the hell and rented it. Watched it in bed, and she fell asleep about half way through - not a good sign. She does that a lot though. Problem is that if she falls asleep I have to turn the volume down fairly low, then it's easy to miss important dialogue/plot points etc. And because of that I got a bit confused about two-thirds of the way through, started going on line on my phone to clarify the plot etc while the movie was still playing, got more confused, then turned it off! Amateur! Anyway, we re-watched it next morning. It blew my head off. Stunning, beautiful epic work of a movie. I love it.

791,pitklad,Entertaining & Predictable,6,28 January 2014,"This movie is a bright Sci-Fi with great visuals, I loved the design of pretty much everything is very balanced and doesn't suffer from the over-designed syndrome that most Sci-Fi movies do, so as the battles on the movie, easy to watch, didn't tire me.The soundtrack is perfect but needed some variety because the constant epicness saturates the tension that music could add in particular scenes.Now about the story it is also simple but not so balanced. The first half of the movie is quite slow while in the other half we get some basic info about the past from the underdeveloped surviver human characters no images about how those people live they are just a background crowd for Morgan Freeman...I guess the writers wanted to give more attention on the love story but still this is not strong enough, generally the movie's picks & revelations are nothing we have never seen before so gets a bit predictable and flat as a whole.It is a shame because this ends up to be just a sci-fi movie with Tom Cruise on it. He doesn't give us something new as a performer while a less known actor could make the movie fresher (also the role feels like it was made for a younger actor) the two very young female characters just emphasize this need. The C.Zeta-Jones clone gives a robot performance while Andrea Riseborough looks like she is the only one trying to give something more to her role. Tom Cruise & Morgan Freeman give a ""no need for effort"" performance. For a humans VS robots movie I would expect to see more passion from the humans.In conclusion Oblivion is entertaining visually, quite easy to watch and predictable. I feel like the director could give more with a more worked story and better actors. But I'm afraid they just wanted to make a commercial movie and not a movie to remember...",Oblivion

The story is also good, though the surprise is revealed midway, and then the movie turns into a sci-fi actioner. But overall, an engaging story throughout. Tom Cruise is his dependable self and carries the movie. Andrea Riseborough is very good. Morgan Freeman is underused. Olga Kurylenko was the weak link. I couldn't picture her as a 'haunting' presence at all. I didn't watch TRON Legacy, so did not know what to expect from director Joseph Kosinski.

The landscape is beautiful, wild and barren; when you get to the hidden valley, the green lushness jumps out of the screen in contrast. The design of the house, the guns, the plane, the bike are all sufficiently futuristic, but not outlandish. The story is good with a couple of fairly obvious twists and of course, the big conspiracy at the heart of the film.The bad:It's too long, it needed someone who wasn't in love with the visuals and the repeated dream sequence to step in and cut at least 15 minutes out of it. The acting is fair, but Morgan Freeman is a little wasted in his ""Morpheus"" role. If you're trying to hide from nasty drones that will shoot you as soon as they see you, maybe it might be better not to have feathers (where did they come from?) sticking out of the top of your head. Although the story is good, there are significant plot holes and mistakes that annoy you, during and after the film is done: why does the Moon still glow 50 years after being torn apart; why is it not very windy in the house above the clouds; how has he never noticed that the dead Scavs are not aliens, but human; did he never wonder how it was that the human race built and launched the Tet after the Earth is devastated by war, floods, famine, earthquakes etc.The ugly:The end is pure cheese; the moment the film ends you start to question it: how did the aliens not notice the bomb he brings in; why did they not kill him the moment they knew he was on to them; why did the aliens want him there anyway, they have thousands like him, why not just destroy the defective unit?It's a shame, if they had devoted as much time to the story arc as they did to the design, this film would be a little futuristic gem, but I don't think it stands up to repeated viewing.

Aliens seems not to have many drones any way.7- Where is the Alien race???? a dozen drone and a pyramid?8- The flying jet that Jack uses can be ordered to go back to base and shut down automatically (When Jack enters the space ship) ,if so why when he escapes with Julia Aliens do not use such a command?????9- Drones appear to have extreme aiming and detecting capabilities , but chasing Jack ship by 3 of them and none a bullet can hit!!10- Why the resistance are so few? are these all what left of humanity?11- The planet is supposed to be hit by endless nukes in war but still NewYork remains are OK to walk by no problem , actually no other area seemed to be hit by any nukes!I can go endlessly but the majority of these thoughts during the show spoiled my excitement , i can not forgive lack of logic by this level.Bottom line , one time watch , great visuals and screenplay , nothing new either in ideas nor in acting , if you do not see it you wont miss anything, i am not paying $10 again for such crap story",Oblivion

801,Foley_67,"A Surprisingly Enjoyable, All Around Well Made Sci-Fi Film.",8,15 April 2013,"I never seem to have a consistent view on sci fi films. From hard sci-fi based in real physics of a highly possible future to the polished sheen and constant explosions of the blockbuster sci fi, I feel like I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy it. It also helps if the film has enough serious tones to solidity that mood and allow me to completely suspend my disbelief in order to really enjoy the film. And unfortunately the beginning of Oblivion put none of these elements in place. Maybe it was the film I had previously seen, The Place beyond The Pines. Maybe it was the somewhat cheesy, generic Tom Cruise character. Maybe the sci-fi world wasn't fleshed out enough. However, before long these notions had dissipated and I become fully enthralled in what would be a thoroughly enjoyable, well-made sci-fi film.Oblivion follows Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). on a wasteland version of earth. Earth has become a wasteland, mostly destroyed by an alien race with the majority of surviving humans living in a massive pyramid shaped version of the International Space Station called the TET. Jacks mission, job and life purpose is to oversee that the remains of earth are utilised by watching over and maintaining the vital energy and resource gathering mills on earth and repairing the armed robot drones that protect these mills. The ""Skavs"" creatures that seem akin to the Sand People of Star Wars are implied to be the remains of the aliens and are placed firmly in the role of antagonist as the film gets starting But as the plot thickens, Jack runs into a great deal of problems, from the mysteries behind humans found alive in hyper sleep chambers, to, gunfights with Skavs, and chases scenes and battles against rogue drones before discovering that maybe everything he has been told is not quite as it seems.The entire visual design and look of this film is where it shines the most. The drones, certainly do seem futuristic with the first person computer screen view cementing them as an Artificial Intelligence with high powered weapons to boot. The contrast between the earth turned wasteland setting and the futuristic highly maintained drones and the bright, whiteness of Jack and headquarters makes each setting stand out and become more interesting than they would be alone. These settings also help to give the feel that this really is a different time to where we are now. Lasers replace bullets for the most part adding to the sci- fi future elements, but with bullets occasionally returning for use with the less well-equipped waste landers that appear. Plot wise, it begins with the typical story of a man with a job to do, but curiosity and mystery interfering with the job and the character questioning the line of duty. Thankfully this plot thickens throughout the movie, with some great twists, each twist further taking the movie into deeper sci-fi territory but never becoming too complex. Cruise plays the hero character well, and although a somewhat generic American hero, a reasoning for this character is given in some revelations throughout the film. The other characters played their parts as they needed to be played but nothing really stood out. Sally (Melissa Leo), although only appearing on video has some gradual changes in personality as the movie continues with some great change coming near the end and ... does this perfectly. Not much more can be said about the plot without spoiling the surprise of the twists but the plot provides enough depth to be interesting but keeps enough action to keep everything exciting too. A word should also be given to the varied electronic and orchestral soundtrack, provided by French electronic artists M83. The score provides ambiance when needed and also some huge sounding orchestral parts when actions revelations or even just huge landscape shots appear. Overall, Oblivion is a great sci-fi film, with a well written story full of twists and revelations, some acting that is perfect for the role and an amazing overall look. The score is brought done slightly by some small plot holes, the acting of supporting characters and the fact that maybe everything is a little too coincidental.",Oblivion

We're stuck in our texting machines and haven't put anyone on the moon in decades. We're happy to be distracted by Wizards, Vampires and post-apocalyptic archers. This movie harks back to the original notions of Science Fiction, back when we really appreciated it. Everything we start out knowing in this movie turns out to be wrong. Humans just won't go away or give up. And they won't stop believing.This movie brings back all of those old, long lost themes. The enemy is faceless, huge and mechanically cynical. It has only one mission, and humans are merely pawns in the scheme.And, in the end, the things that make us human become the defining theme of the movie.

If you like sci fi then friend this is your way to go with some amazing visuals. Just don't listen to those who have given bad reviews, I must give them a piece of advice watch Bollywood movies, then you'll come know what is worse.

808,valiantvu,Minimalist Perfection,8,14 December 2013,"Firstly, I acknowledge that there were logical flaws throughout the movie. The largest flaw being that the main lie that Victoria and Jack are operating under is that the Scavs are aliens, so why didn't the Scavs just take off their damn helmets during one of Jack's routine drone fixes and say ""Check it out, I'm human."" Personally, it doesn't bother me too much if things don't 100% make sense. Although I was anticipating a twist and knew that there were humans running around on Earth, I still enjoyed the reveal that the human race had almost entirely been wiped out and the Tech harbored aliens. I also appreciated that the film didn't linger on this fact too long to try to evoke more shock from the audience. The movie went on and dropped another surprise on you with a Jack clone. The plot thickened slowly, but steadily and kept me engaged through the end. Even though there weren't a lot of components to the film (Jack, Victoria, Sally, Scavs, drones, the Tech, sea-harvesting machines), each component had weight and quality. A couple funny things to think about after you're done watching: 1. Where did Julia get tomato seeds? 2. She got pregnant from one night? (so typical in movies :P) 3. What's going to happen when the 50 other Jack clones on Earth find that Julia is alive? No one wants poor Victoria.Anyway, I loved Oblivion. The minimalist aesthetic, forward moving suspense, and great CG help make this a great sci-fi film.",Oblivion

It can be the only reason to see it too! The characters did their job and it wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be with Morgan freeman and Tom cruise, it actually made the movie more exciting and intriguing. The story is unique and is very interesting to watch, some moments can surprise you even if some moment is easy to predict it is not bad because of it.I will make this review short because I think any spoilers would ruin it for you.

Some of the scenes went on a bit but to be honest I enjoyed this as it got you familiar with the characters and what their aspirations were.There were some nice twists during the film which were unexpected and we all enjoyed the ending.Some people said the plot was complicated and difficult to follow.

Its not the first time Tom Cruise has starred in an alien Sci-FI if Minority Report (2002) and war of the worlds(2005) come to mind but as a drone repair man in a post apocalyptic earth I wanted to see what he could genuinely offer to the movie.Joseph Kolsinski who directed the Tron Legacy which I really enjoyed directed this, however I have to admit the plot to this movie was not always coherent ,for starters I could not figure out if the ""Scavengers"" were android robots in the beginning or rebel sophisticated advanced earthlings who were the antagonists in the plot ,secondly the flash blacks to his previous life before his memory was erased even made it more dumbfounding. A bit confusing there and there as I saw his clone protégé and wondered what has two ""Jack Harpers"" got to do with the movie.Morgan Freeman on my part saved the movie from its total collapse as I was able to then link the pieces together and understand how all the characters were intertwined. The ending was like any other ending with striking resemblance to the I robot and hellraiser 4 where the villain self destructs in an ever ending inferno.I will have to give this movie a worthy 7/10 ,even though I was highly critical it did have good visual and CGI effects to keep me going and no pun intended push me into a state of oblivion",Oblivion

The story is great. Unusually intelligent and unexpected. The action sequences are very tense and exciting. The special effects are gently done and understated.In short, the best film I have seen for a long, long time.It's essentially a science fiction film, but also has a love story at its core.

814,gjmooresam,Visually A masterpiece... storyline lacking,7,14 April 2013,"I did enjoy this film to some extent. The visuals are absolutely stunning and some of the best i have seen in a while; watching the featurette showed me how much effort was put into the visuals and it definitely shows. The film is polished and the way the action sequences intermingle with the visuals is enough for anyone to go and see this film. But prepare yourself to be slightly disappointed with the storyline if you are a big science fiction fan. I could see a number of adolescent teens finding the storyline to be the best most intricate thing ever seen, but to any hardened science fiction fan there will be a slight sense of disappointment. *spoilers ahead* The film seems to have taken various concepts from many science fiction films and smooshed them together within this film. I saw bits from the matrix (1999), moon (2009) and 2001 a space odyssey (1968). And i am sure there may have been more. The thing about science fiction is it's easier ability to be original, you can imagine anything in the future and thats science fiction. This film does the opposite, it has taken rather then imagined. It has me to believe that this film may of been a homage to science fiction but i can't really tell. The acting is a little weak, and when tom cruise decides to play basketball with a flannel shirt and new york baseball cap on i couldn't help but cringe (and i felt like the rest of the audience felt the same way). There are elements that have made this a reasonable film but to any real science fiction fan you will leave the cinema with an air of disappointment. 7/10. Giddy Up.",Oblivion

It's nothing but the mixture of already existing movies, with a lots of cliché. There are also tragically illogical things in the movie...Nevertheless the CGI animations look quite good, but I think that's basic for every CGI movies nowadays.

818,allegrahr,What is happening to Hollywood?,2,4 January 2014,"Seriously, what is going on with the film industry, human intelligence in general? The movie Idiocracy is turning out to be quite a prophecy. The only good thing about Oblivion are the visual, special effects. The story is for the brain dead. For starters the timeline. If it were the years 2117/2177, OK, although all movies are more or less fiction, it could be logically legit that we have an alien invasion, world disaster, extraterrestrial high tech etc. But the years 2017/2077, come on... And why on earth can't Hollywood make a movie without an irritating cheesy cliché love story, in this movie a love triangle even. Cruise is of course a macho hero, ""the chosen one"" (lol, a slight Matrix rip off), a clone that ""awakens"" his memories of his human life. The actresses have, as usual for American production, plastic perfect bodies and they, of course, pointlessly take their clothes off at some point. Oh, and a pool in the sky (in which of course one of the female characters dives in naked, lol), as an addition to a super high tech house waaay up in the sky, cool idea, but come on... And even though there are just the two of them in the house, practically on the planet, all the time Riseborough is wearing divine business dresses, high heels, jewelry and has perfect make-up and hair. Talk about stereotypes and sexism... Even Doctor Who makes more sense. The rough idea for the movie is good, although everything was predictable in the movie, within the first twenty minutes I knew the bad guys were the good ones and were human, not alien and that the area struck by radiation wasn't struck by it at all... And why can't they make 1:30h movies like the used to? This was a pointless stretch, as if the movie wasn't boring enough... Oh, well, that's 2h of my life I'll never get back, thank heavens I didn't have to pay to watch it, I would've demanded my money back.",Oblivion

I went to the cinema today in anticipation of a decent sci fi film, and all I got was a lackluster clichéd pile of rubbish! The acting was poor, Andrea Riseborough overacting, just like she did in 'Welcome to the Punch', and it wasn't Cruise's best performance. What ruined the film for me was an abundance of plot holes and a bizarre and unorthodox ending, put at the same time as generic as they come! The 30 second journey between Yosemite national park and the empire state building particularly made me chuckle to myself. Simple mistakes relating to physics that a 10 year old could pick out: Jack's swimming pool that is somewhere in the stratosphere has perfect wind speeds and temperature to strip off and jump into!

Walking through the movie really bring some chills in that darkest scene. Regardless of its initial slow pace it actually puts you in oblivion and imitates you to discover the plot but it grows a new direction every time and reveals at the end! Tom cruise performing brilliantly with Sir Morgan freeman and of course the actresses. Some very impressive special effects of after-earth and the shattered moon.

I think tom cruise does a good job, he really showed me why he should do sci fi films. I also think Olga really brought it, she made some of moments in the movie really stand out. I also think Morgan freeman was a boss, I like that the director did not make it about him or showed too much of him. So going back on the graphics, the scenery in the movie was outstanding. Some plots in the story was predictable, but they are original ideas here also that you can appreciate. I give this a seven because they are times where the director could do better, but also there were parts that could have gone bad if not done right. I believe that this film will age well in time, unlike some sci fi films that get outdated or just generic,I feel that this film will not suffer from it.",Oblivion

The storyline was OK, but a tad predictable...especially the ending. My biggest criticism was the length of the film...everything could have been tightened up by the removal of a good many superfluous scenes. Tom Cruise does a decent job as does the rest of the cast. Morgan Freeman really has little more than what amounts to a cameo appearance in the film. If you were expecting him to have a major role in the movie, you will likely be disappointed.

So you know I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan cause I see him as a pretty boy image. The story started off good on what was left of Earth after nuclear war. However, the movie spent a lot of time with developing Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough characters. There was some brief nudity in this movie of Andrea's backside. Sorry in HD no matter how dark the film maker tried to make the shot still lots of detail. Somewhere around halfway through the movie I had figured out the twist in the plot of the story. To me this is where the movie should have switched gears into the twist. It did not. When the movie started putting the whole story together for the audience it seemed rushed. At one point my son thought the movie was going to end without telling the story of what really happened to Earth. The movie ran long but we did enjoy the show. Special effects awesome, sound was great and Tom did OK in the tough guy role. Good movie to go see.",Oblivion

Yes, I agree that visually this movie can be appealing to sci-fi fans, myself being one of them, but to others who look for some sort of reasonable plot, originality, or logic behind what's taking place, forget it. I suppose most of the $120,000,000 budget went to CGI and they just made up some plot to go with it. Maybe Hollywood is running out of ideas, as there are many recycled ones in this one, but they are certainly running out of good screen writers.

I'm not going to give any spoilers because the plot was so weak that there is practically nothing to spoil...yeah, the movie was that bad. The movie lasts for about two hours and there are only three action scenes. The rest of the movie is just bad acting, corny speeches and pointless scenes; for example the sex scene was okay but what made it ridiculous was the music. The music was probably the only good thing about the movie, but sometimes it would do this random drum chorus that sounded retarded, like during the sex scene and the climax. The script written for the actors was awful, i know Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman did there best, but like The Avengers, good actors don't make a good movie, a good movie needs 1) Awesome plot 2) Awesome scripts for actors 3) Good music, and finally 4) Mind-blowing action/scenery. All of those things are important except maybe the last one. This movie has none of those things. There is a bunch of scenery but almost no action at all. I also noticed nothing new, meaning everything was copied from other movies like the matrix, Predator and even some video games like Portal. If this is the best Michael Arndt can come up with then i am sorry to say this but Star Wars is as good as dead. After watching this lame sci-fi flick i have absolutely no expectations for new Star Wars movies. I mean come on, if Phantom Menace was better than this, which it is by the way, then there is no way Disney's Star Wars films are going to top off the prequels. This movie is only good for one thing; to show the world what a terrible writer Michael Arndt is and why Disney should have nothing to do with Star Wars...period",Oblivion

I wish it had a little more action in it, but it is not really that type of movie. The story is very detailed you need to pay attention to the voice overs to understand this movie. The music was very kind of techno/ TRON like. It was very keyboard meets action thriller which failed a little for me. This takes place in the future the date the earth was destroyed which was 2017 and it takes place 60 years after that. Tom cruise is an action movie nut. He always does a great job with his characters. This movie is made in layers details in this movie always come back to some importance. Everything in this movie makes sense by the 15 minutes.

The only way to destroy them is with nuclear weapons. Now Earth lies barren while the remains of humanity heads for Titan. A few repair men are left behind to maintain the drones that protect the floating factories mining the last of Earth's resources from the ocean. The last of the invaders known as ""Scavs"" are intent on destroying these structures.Tom Cruise is Jack Harper, technician 49 along with partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are responsible for maintaining the drones and ensuring that the sea water mining stations are defended against the ""Scavs"". Victoria remains on their tower providing back up and communications for Jack while he patrols the scarred remains of Earth.During one of his patrols Jack discovers a signal coming from a tower, beaming into space. Shortly after a mysterious object crashes and Jack races to investigate. Jack's discovery that the object in question turns out to be a ""lifeboat"" carrying human passengers challenges everything he has been taught to believe.I wasn't sure what to expect going in to Oblivion. I was fairly unimpressed with Tron Legacy, director and writer Joseph Kosinski's last movie. Style over substance was what worried me. Tron Legacy was visually stunning but ultimately soul-less.You can see from the first frame that Kosinski hasn't lost any sense of style. Everything looks stunning. Jack and Victoria's home/ work place is a crisp minimalistic stone and glass tower, a stark contrast with the scorched Earth below. The bleak landscape of Iceland stands in for the ruins of New York, home to the remaining ""Scavs"". Mind you, this should be expected from Kosinski as he based this on his original graphic novel so he should know exactly what he wants on screen.Cruise and Riseborough are great - they seem to be the perfect couple but something is bubbling underneath. I can't go in to any more details without giving away the many plot twists in the movie.Some of the other characters don't get as much development and suffer from this, again I can't say too much without spoiling the film.Similarly to Tron Legacy, this film does feel slightly soul-less. The strength of the actors' performances certainly helps to combat this but there is a feeling of emptiness at the end of the movie. I still enjoyed it and would be quite happy to see it again but I wouldn't rush to buy it at full price - I'll wait till it's in an offer somewhere!The other main niggle is the film copies many other of its sci-fi predecessors. There are many scenes which merely nod at previous movies but there are some that are lifted wholesale from other films.

Cruise tries his hardest to hold the film together, but some of the dialogue sounds like it has been taken from a crappy version of Mars Attacks. It reminded me too much of a number of previous sci-fis(2001-A Space Odyssey springs to mind).The score also didn't suit some of the scenes, and was too-The Dark Knight-y in places,though it worked well for the action scenes.

831,buffa82,Oblivion is a letdown and feels cold to the touch,6,20 April 2013,"Oblivion is a letdown to say the least. Since my colleague Moore reviewed it for the site, I was able to catch it and just watch it like a normal movie lover. Going in I was hoping for a riveting science fiction blast of entertainment because I like Cruise and he doesn't waste our time with his work. I left trying to understand what happened to a solid idea for a film? The biggest problem with the film is it carries ZERO payoff. Sure, we get an answer(somewhat) to Harper's riddle and his struggle and find out what exactly happened to him before the earth was obliterated, but in the final moments a sweet little bow-tie is placed on the film and it sinks the film deeper in muck. The climax is disappointing and the resolution is downright corny and second rate. When in doubt, Hollywood screenwriters resort to a failsafe tactic in their writing and here they did it again in a manner of speaking. Oblivion starts off hot, starts to die slowly and ends with a thud. Cruise is an underrated actor and usually nails his roles(you don't have 12 straight 100 million dollar grossing films and 3 Oscar noms for no reason) but here he is miscast in the role and brings the movie down. Freeman just kind of shows up and spits out inspirational jargon. The women's parts are very underwritten. Worst of all, the film has no soul. No emotional impact. If it had half the heart and soul of Derek Cianfrance's A Place Beyond The Pines, the result may have been more worthy. As it is, Oblivion is a disappointing stinker which may deserve a look on DVD or a late night stop on cable. Next up....Pain and Gain.",Oblivion

Throughout, the viewer is sympathetic toward the protagonist and other characters. One feels compassion for the characters' situation and interest for how things will turn out for them. In my opinion, one of the earmarks of a good science fiction story is that it establishes a set of rules or laws and then follows those rules to their logical conclusions. As you become familiar with the rules, it is possible to almost anticipate what will come next, building tension as you wait. So long as the story obeys its own rules, I am willing to suspend my disbelief and the science fiction, however radial, drives the story. Oblivion does this well, explaining the state of the world, if you will, and then remaining completely within those confines throughout. The cinematography, computer generated graphics, and story logic (as described above) combine to make this science fiction film plausible, beautiful, and entertaining.",Oblivion

You seem to either love or hate it (judging from the reviews), but try to not read or view any spoilers! If you liked Tron: Legacy its safe to assume that you will love this one! If you haven't seen the movie, stop reading this review now!--- SPOILERS AHEAD ---The score is excellent with Tom Cruise giving his best. Most notably for me though was Andrea Riseborough's Vica. You constantly think something's wrong with her but you just can't put your finger on it.A lot of people have complained about the plot having too many plot holes and elements copied from other SciFi movies. Without doubt there are a few goofs - but which movie doesn't have any? None of them are really crucial and they did not ruin the movie for me.In my eyes the plot is excellent and a lot of details pay homage to great classics of the genre. Just a few examples: If you know how and why HAL was named HAL, it might be worth looking up, how TET might have come to its name. TET's actions and reactions are very interesting from an AI's methodology. And did you notice, that Julia's daughter was played by twins? How awesome is that (if it wasn't just coincidence)! It's also interesting, that almost nobody discusses the re-appearance and treatment of Harper 52 at the end of the movie. At least for me this suggested some major ethical questions.In short: SciFi at its best in the shape of a blockbuster.",Oblivion
835,darkpool,A rather brilliant Sci Fi Action movie with heart.,9,30 July 2013,"Brilliant, brilliant and, well, brilliant.The entire film is brilliant.The entire landscape and soundscape is wonderful.The pacing, editing, direction and CGI are all flawless.Tom Cruise really can carry a movie and imbue it with a solidity and grounded manliness and this is a brilliant vehicle for him.Olga Kurylenko does a lovely turn in her role, showing a sensitivity that helps bring the human element of the film to life.Same too does Andrea Riseborough, who is equally lovely, but in a different, more sublime way.But, even with the great Morgan Freeman present, it is Tom Cruise who really brings this movie to life.I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good story told well. Especially if they like it mixed with action. And even more so if they love SciFi with a human element, as I do.",Oblivion
836,russlikesmovies,Stupendous movie!!,9,24 May 2013,"Pros:Plot: Interesting (8/10) Acting: Great (10/10) Screenplay: Phenomenal (10/10) Cinematography: Beautiful (10/10) Sound-work: Polished to perfection (10/10) Overall, one heck of a movie! (9/10) Cons: There were only a few elements that slightly bothered me throughout the movie. For starters, the soundtrack was great, but could have been better. Don't get me wrong, I liked it a lot, but it sounded too much like Tron at various points during the movie. Another element was the reoccurring science fiction aspect that all humans are are reproductive bodies, and that all love is is a feeling. The soul was forgotten. This isn't a big deal though. It's just a personal opinion.Also, be aware that the movie does contain some foul language, such as words ranging from the 'd word' and 's word' to words like g** d*** and the 'f bomb'. Near the beginning there're two scenes possessing brief yet minor nudity (Nothin' but butt. It's PG-13, so that's all they can really show.) I also felt like there was an anti-god aspect near the end of the movie. I may be overreacting about that one. You'll just have to judge for your self. I don't want to give away any spoilers or else I'll be ""blacklisted"". I'm new here, and that wouldn't be fun.Conclusion: All in all, Oblivion is a visually masterful, and immensely entertaining movie! A definite must- see for science fiction fans and non-science fiction fans alike!",Oblivion
837,gorann1993,"Great movie, great story!",8,25 July 2013,"Great movie, kinda predictable but I loved it! I liked the story, action and acting. Story was absolutely amazing, If you are fan of alien invasion movies and world ends this is the movie for you. Appearance of Morgan Freeman made this movie so much better.But to be honest this movie was predictable at the end. Too many silence scenes; no music. Final conclusion, great movie, warmly recommended to watch. Rate 8/10 because it was kinda predictable for me. All in all great movie, probably one of best in this genre.This is the Best Out on its on Sci Fiction movie I've seen in a very long time. As good as the Star Trek movies but no comparison",Oblivion

But it is WAY TOO MUCH waiting until it even touched the main storyline. The life of a couple, always effective, blah blah blah.. But honestly, the fact that Vica and Jack are aliens is quite surprising, so it is a major plus too. I always loved Cruise and this movie reminds me of Top Gun (which I like very very much), but because he is the most suitable person, I won't complain. All in all, I only give this movie seven out of ten, because it made me yawn and sleepy a little bit.",Oblivion
839,sacredsoul_13,Nothing special....almost predictable,4,9 August 2013,"This is 2013....and already we have seen tons of Sci-Fi ....aliens in our planet...zombies here....zombies in mars...hi-tech (nearly illogical) gadgets,post nuclear holocaust, machines gone rouge and Cloning....I wont say there are no good sci-fi but common how long.. since early 70's Science fictions are more or less permutation and combinations of the elements mentioned (more or less).... Certainly it has become lot more tough to shock us with these stuff now-a-days.Yet if you try it out the easiest formula is put some bankable names( tom cruise & Morgan Freeman in this case)....do a good sound comp and no compromise with Graphics then put all the elements together to make a SCI-FI MILKSHAKE. Oblivion seemed nothing more than that...good visualization and sound effects and that's all..Up-to first thirty minutes one can hardly fathom actually what is going on because indeed NOTHING SEEMS TO GO ON... all the things seems to be stuck in slow-mo,not the starting i expected.Actions sequences were nothing new and lacked creativity....there is really little room for actual ACTING...characters seemed shallow and obviously both stars of the movie could have been utilized in lot more better way...However not bad as a TIME PASS movie...but if u expect something intense like Mission Impossible or Knight and Day (posters and covers were indeed misleading )then you will be disappointed",Oblivion
840,nmt-tomlinson,"Entertaining and Original, very predictable; could have done more",6,6 August 2013,"Ill put a big (SPOILER) before them.First off, this is intriguing, you get a vague sense that TOm CRuise is not who he thinks he is. THe movie has a very (SPOILER) (not just for this movie but for the Sam Rockwell MOON) MOON feeling from the start. It is very obvious what the scavs actually are, and anyone can start to see a bigger conspiracy unravel.It is very entertaining and well done, but i wouldn't consider any of the plot twists ""good"". Maybe the one where he (SPOILER-minor) enters the radiation zone is passable, but the rest are very obvious. Beyond that, some good old fashioned canyon fighter-drone flying scenes and a couple of shoot-ups. It could have been a lot moreEND SPOILERNo mistake, this is very aesthetic and well-done, thoroughly entertaining, etc. I highly recommend you watch it, just don't expect to see something shake your sci-fi inner child like Star Wars ep 4 or something.If you wan't a sci-fi masterpiece, or something more like it, look into Moon, Looper, or Book of Eli for twists and turns that make you think, morality that affects you like Bioshock Little sisters, and just a better film.",Oblivion
841,dragonslayer36824,Watch for the *AWESOME* visual effects!,4,8 August 2013,"It's 2017. Aliens(called ""The Scavengers"") in-universe attack. We nuke the Earth. We migrate to Titan(?!). Fast forward 60 years to 2077, and we have Jack(Tom Cruise) and Victoria(Andrea Riseborough) -- two people whose job is to protect the power sources here for our colony at Titan. Their memory is wiped sometime back, and when Jack starts to remember, things go awry.As you noticed, the film's story is horribly, horribly clichéd. It mirrors some of Cruise's earlier roles. It even features signature shots of Tom Cruise running a la Mission Impossible. You could guess what happens at the end at the first 30 minute mark itself. And I personally hated the climax.As for the acting, it is good. Cruise is excellent. Riseborough and Kurylenko(who plays Jack's wife Julia) are good. The role of the resistance leader is built for Morgan Freeman(he makes everything better :D), and Ser Jaime Lannister is there too.However, the real highlight of the film is the visual effects. They are totally awesome -- whether they be a damaged Empire State Building, a destroyed moon, or the home in the valley. Fantastic!! Could just watch for them again :) Music is -- well, it's not exceptionally great, it's not terrible either, although it is jarring at times. Final thought: I really feel that this should've been made as a video game, instead of a film. It has everything required for a video game!!",Oblivion
842,brettstacy1,briefly...,7,2 September 2013,"I have developed a loss of confidence in Tom Cruise's ability to entertain me.Jack Reacher was a bit of a snooze so I had low expectations for Oblivion. I did enjoy this film and give it the same rating as Prometheus,7/10. I enjoy sci fi, though not an acolyte ,and this film had enough story to keep me in it, and then some. Tom's age worked for him as he needed to look a bit weathered , but was still a bit too pretty. Where are the ugly guys with acting chops? The ugly men need to be used in Hollyweird to give these films a gritty feel. That is one of the things I like about British TV acting...real people who CAN act.It works on many levels...though I understand why the US film machine relies on household names like CRuise,I still hope for a time when more films use unknown actors who may not fit the typical mold.The whole time Im thinking about Cruise's films, his ageing,his interest in Scientology...this prevents me from being fully transported by a film. Overall, a totally rent-able movie.",Oblivion

Sci-fi is one of my favourites genres and I am happy to suspend some belief in the interests of enjoyment but this is one of those films that throws all reason out of the window and gleefully re-uses some of the better sci-fi set-ups without any thought as to the reality of the situation.I should have given up after the first 10 minutes but it is one of those infuriating films that you feel compelled to watch to the end. Don't make my mistake as I now want someone to help me forget I ever watched this movie, which is still preying on my mind (not in a good way) a day later and which has compelled me to write this review as some kind of catharsis.",Oblivion

845,gemini4,Moon revisited,3,20 October 2013,"Sorry, this plot has too much in common with the movie 'Moon' from 1999 to score highly. Moon is essentially the story of a futuristic maintenance worker who oversees machines producing energy for those back on earth. The hero works alone in remote zones and frequently finds himself out of radio-range from those who control him. The moon worker eventually discovers he is a clone, his wife is a recycled illusion and his life is a charade created by his masters. Similarly, in Oblivion, the protagonist is a man fighting the good fight by maintaining and securing energy creation machines. Authorities conceal the clones true identity from him (along with fact he and his love are both clones) so he keeps working to create energy for their world. In his travels, the clone discovers other versions of himself. The clone discovers the love of his life, and his mission is a scam setup by the people who control him. The clone uses the motivation of true love to eventually rebel against his evil masters. Using escape pods in the name of love for the finale is fundamentally the same between the movies except for the direction of travel. Oblivion is well produced and features attractive stars but the concept is not sufficiently original to be challenging.",Oblivion
846,cs_veg,Oblivion - a real flick to our modern days,8,6 June 2014,"In my opinion, Oblivion is a real flick to our modern days.What is this story really about, if we ""cut off"" the sci-fi scenery?There is a strange couple who lives at the top of the world in a modern house equipped with wide windows, beautiful view and -of course- a pool.The woman is a neat-freak and careerist whose god is her boss. The man is an engineer, who does his routine everyday job, but he has a romantic soul. (The soundtrack shows this ambivalence, a floating sound over a repeated pattern.) Fan of baseball, old LPs and other retro stuff. Thus, he also has an old ruined cabin at the lake shore. He doesn't even dare to show it to her.In their circle everyone looks like a clone, who does the same dull job, no human distinctive characteristics, everyone just looks like the other. Outside of their circle, all the people are ""scavs"", like they would belong to an alien planet, with attacking intentions, to storm the heavens of upper classes.What is it that these rich people really do? They suck Earth's resources until she -holy Gaia- will be a desert and they hope they can move forward to another planet to plunder.The controlling center is ""TET""; in French ""tête"" means ""head"" and ""leader"". Thus the leaders are living far away from the dusty Earth, almost in the sky. They control the law enforcement, the drone-like, machine-like executioners. The leaders have no human feelings; the only important thing is the effectiveness to achieve their goals. They speak in an artificial, insincere voice and their all existence is based on lies.So, there is this couple. The woman, Victoria -namely, who strives victory- belongs to and represents these cool blood upper classes. The man starving for some human experience -to feel some real life-, but finds no understanding from his spouse. Living in an ivory tower and longing for a real life, wanting to go ""down"" back to the Earth - these feelings are expressed by the scene of the starter fall of Jack's driving his flying vehicle.And one day a woman of his dreams (literally) drops from the clouds (literally)...So, what this movie really mean to me, is the question if we dare to live a real life or not, can we draw back from the Earth-destroying madness of our modern days. And can we find a way to our -not so shiny not so equipped but real- home of cosiness. And the movie's title -Oblivion- asks us: after the memory erase-like brainwashing of our everyday routines, is our soul still capable yet to remember our real essence to being human and live a real life?Is this a dream or can it be real?",Oblivion
847,bentbilluglyhillary,Time I'll never get back,2,16 June 2014,"One of the most poorly acted and painfully boring movies I can remember seeing. Tom Cruise is certainly no heavyweight, but his attempts in this movie didn't even come up to the standards of a high school play. Although this thing was on TV, and I didn't have to pay theater prices to see it, the time I wasted watching Oblivion is lost forever.No way could I bear to stay on the channel continuously through the entire torture, so I was continually 'grazing'.

849,mark_r_knowles,Great Love It!,10,2 December 2015,Regarding the criticisms of others these to fall into 2 kinds: 1. Derivative plot ideas from other Sci movies 2. Implausibility/inconsistency of plot So my reply: 1. Most Sci movies are to some extent derivative of other films or books. However I think the whole is greater than the sum of the parts in this case. Combining these ideas in the way done has created a new and unique story in itself. 2. So often in Sci you have to go with the premises and see where it takes you. Many popular Sci movies have implausible elements which I could list yet this does not detract from the story. In this case I don't think any of the elements are so implausible that they couldn't potentially be explained away.,Oblivion

The story unfolds gradually to a big stunner at the end and only slows at the middle. The music is very similar to THE DARK KNIGHT as i found with TRON:LAGACY but i enjoyed it anyway.

Instead of the Superbowl court for example which is the crater itself. And his life is in danger but he does not need any protective clothing or some kind of robot or another clone support.

Amount of oxygen-decent, no wind no solar radiation all cool. Another subject that was so ridiculous, he brings his wife back, her memory was not wiped out.

And yes they make instant connection moment later they are already heading the crash scene. No talking no explanations nothing just all for granted.

Joseph Kosinski's second film outing is a modern homage to the great sci-fi films that have come before. He has taken themes predominant in science fiction and filtered them through his own unique lens. Does this make it a sin? Isn't everything a derivative of something that has come before, or has the keyboard toting armchair review elitism of our current age prevented us from enjoying movies with an open mind? This film is one that pays much attention to visual detail and has struck an efficient balance of atmosphere coupled with an arresting soundtack that has been tastesfully layered throughout the movie...even till the end credits.The casting of Andrea Riseborough as Vistoria is an inspired choice. She epitomizes the lead character's struggle with their mission. Her performance is poised, measured and immersive. Olga Kurylenko as Julia provides a suitable contrast to the lead protagonist's ideological wrestle with his assigned task. Finally, Tom Cruise gets much flack due to his larger than life public persona and his many dances with controversial issues, but that should not take away his credibility as an actor. In terms of production value, fans of cinematography, effects and art direction will no doubt get a kick out of watching this carefully considered piece of film design. Check out the making of here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=DzqdzBZRM9kThoroughly enjoyed this film, yes the reviews are mixed, but that's the beauty of movies, everybody gets a chance to make up their own minds.

But you should not have to go through this level of disappointment at the point of maximum anticipation.What was absent was any sense of who these bad extra-terrestrials where, why they did what they did... All we get is a giant desk ornament?!? What is this, 2001 (the movie)? Perhaps my ignorance of the original material - is the Tet dear to the hearts of fans? I am sorry but massive power and advanced intelligence requires complexity. Even 'Battleship' got that right (and everything else wrong, but that's another story).What was also absent was any sense of struggle to achieve victory against overwhelming odds (Independence Day all over again?). (This strongly linked to a complete vacuum of imagination in relation to the bad guys).Not sure if this was a case of 'we ran out of time/budget'. It amazes me any movie representing thousands of peoples' efforts can pass through months of scrutiny, re-writes etc without someone saying 'hold on guys, something's missing'.There are some plot holes but i forgive all these for the gorgeous production design - clothes -vehicles - buildings etc - and the breathtaking natural landscapes used as the environment.ACtually not forgive completely. The masks thing... seems to satisfy the plot but not have a valid reason from the characters' viewpoint - why would you pretend to be the enemy?? especially when there seems to be no example of one to copy... and if they hadn't done this the plot would have fallen apart, right? As with so many it comes down to the writing - the story itself. The x millions of $ of actual production are not the issue. Why can't we get stories that are immune from criticism?

Must we obey our God or face him and set each of ourselves as our own Gods?
I don't know and this movie sure didn't prove to even be aware it could have been as grand as one that indeed noticed how to write characters' speech and plot and become a movie with it's own identity, character... art. Becoming a must watch that could make each and everyone of it's viewers make real questions and become inspired. That's what this movie could have been.

And a couple engaged to be married would of course be sent on a space mission together.I didn't really get the gist of the story, but that's because there was too much whispering by the characters. Usually the whispering would take place after noisy fighting scenes.There's lots of silly sound effects made by Jack's flying machine, but I was reassured to hear that computer systems of the future still use the same reassuringly futuristic beepy-clicky noises that all computer systems from films and TV of the past twenty years use just so I know that deep complex computations are taking place.I found myself critical of the scenarios the Jack was placed in, to only later find they were not what they seemed. Clever. A twist!

Oblivion is plot driven and it is like a puzzle (if not a sophisticatedly complex one) that you're presented piece by piece. There's not really one single big moment of surprise, the mystery is simply unraveled throughout the film. You don't get a flashback at the end to sum it all up or anything, so you have to follow the plot and pay attention to it.The visuals are indeed stunning. And of course there's CGI. But the way it's used doesn't attract negative attention. It's just smoothly embedded into the movie.There are action scenes. But they don't go on forever. They are well placed and legitimate.Sure, the plot isn't entirely original and innovative. But it's very well done and thought through.***SPOILERS***WARNING***SPOILERS*** As for the allegedly implausible technology. It's alien technology! The human technology we get to see (i.e. scavengers technology) isn't that much more advanced than what we have today. And I would expect an alien race that travels through the galaxy exploiting planets to be far more advanced than we'll be in 2017. So I find it entirely plausible.The ending might seem a bit rosy but I think that's mainly because it's a kind of happy ending.",Oblivion
868,seanyeageradventures,Great movie experience well worth watching and understanding,9,29 December 2020,"Take in the music, the scenery, the visuals, the action and the twists.
This is a superior sci-fi film with humanity written through it.
Having watched it several times, it gets better with repeat viewings. The soundtrack is amazing and the cinematography is top-class.
Sure, we can pick some holes in the plot if we choose, but for me this is a top drawer movie that leaves you thinking about what-ifs and the nature of our own lives. Do we live for tech or do we live for our own simple desires and instincts? This is right up there with the best sci-fi movies.",Oblivion

Acting of Tom Curise and Morgan Freeman were expectional as always. However, the gun fight were meh and stupid. So many death were unnecessary. The weapons human used were trash considering it was at the year 2077. Nevertheless, the story was good and the amosphere was stunning. I enjoy the movie a lot.",Oblivion

The heart of the Tet draws on '2001', but the execution of that falls flat in comparison.",Oblivion

STILL WATCH IT. GREAT FILM . . . . I really don't want to go into too much depth about the storyline as spoilers would. well spoil it , everything is explained at the start of the film, and you have to pick up on those little hints throughout it to really enhance your imagination of what happens/happened. enjoy, i only wish i could have that first watch again .",Oblivion
873,Piggyton,Thought provoking Sci Fi with twists,9,24 July 2013,"I went into ""Oblivion"" blindly thinking it was a run of the mill post apocalyptic feature with gorgeous visuals but little in the way of true substance.I was completely wrong! While this film does boast it's fair share of visual effects it also has a solid and thought provoking storyline with plenty of twists and turns.Tom Cruise once again proves that he can present engrossing characters into his 50's. Morgan Freeman also has a small but important role in the film. The characters meshed well and brought the story to life without taking from it. Sometimes I will watch films and be more interested in the star than the character they're portraying but I was too mentally ""in"" the film to let my mind drift.If someone is looking for a good Sci Fi/thriller/mystery I would definitely recommend this film for two good full hours of entertainment.",Oblivion
874,Fangorn1,Good movie which could have been great,7,13 April 2013,"Just recently coming out from the theater, I have mixed feelings regarding this movie. Most things about Oblivion are good, very good actually. The cast is excellent, they all bring personality into their respective roles. The cast is not actually very large, but no more are needed. Visually, Oblivion is stunning. Beautiful scenery and good-looking special effects. It does feel a bit spartan as a whole, but it does fit the theme. The music is also great, adding to the feel of epicness to the movie. I would really recommend watching this movie in the theaters, it is definitely that kind of a movie.With all of these aspects of greatness, there is a major one on which Oblivion fails to deliver. Unfortunately, its the story part. It is a bit thin. While the story is not bad, its not good either so it sums up to merely okay. And for this epic kind of movie, this is a let down.In summary, Oblivion is an epic movie which could have been great had there been more depth to it.

Went to the cinema with a few of my best friends and we were all captivated and held in place by a warm feeling of satisfaction until the end.The whole spin at the end was somewhat inspired by The island but it still delivered a shock when Morgan Freeman started to explain everything.

It was presented with Tim Cruise solving a global problem however it only felt very much a couple people solving there own unique problem with his help.Some time spent showing a global broader issue would have validated the struggle.Beyond that, I highly suggest a watch.",Oblivion
877,kris-cotten,Oblivion,7,20 April 2013,"TLDR: I'd recommend seeing this movie.Long story short, I don't feel that this movie was wasted time. Oblivion just dragged on at times and was in need of editing to pare down the film about fifteen/twenty minutes. The big reveals were underdeveloped and anti-climatic, and two love interests superfluous. I really wish there had been more effort in developing the object's personality and motivations. Any attempt to humanize the humans as they did for the robots would have been really helpful as well.However, the soundtrack was pleasant and some of the scenery breathtakingly haunting. Always enjoy seeing what others imagine the future will hold in terms of gadgets, architecture, and clothing. Cruise did a superb job, the film was just too much for him to hold together on his own. And obviously, Freeman could have been used to much more effect.",Oblivion
878,neofloyd,Best Movie of 2013 and probably last 15 years,10,23 July 2013,"1- It has something for everyone: it has action, great visuals, CG, gadgets, haunting romance, mystery and the story makes sense.2- Tom Cruise is really stepping his game up. He may very well be the best actor of our time. It takes a really keen eye to see everything he does with his gestures and reactions and he only seems to get better with time.3- Lets talk about this film's score : It follows a progression so beautifully and fits with every facet of this movie. It begins by fitting well with the presentation of this apocalyptic world but with a glimmer of hope, then with the dream sequences and revelation of lost love and that awesome vocalization by Susanne Sundfør at the end. The sound is timeless. It gave me goose bumps really, This is only mentioning the main theme. All the other extracts are just as well made. I think M83 will be doing a lot more scores soon.Also the sound effects in this movie are amazing, the clones, the signals, the devices. everything is awesome.4- The Script: I might catch some flack for this but I think it was well executed and if there is a glitch at this point it is the fact that they do not explain why at the beginning of the movie we see the ""Scabs"" move in a very animal manner almost running on all 4's. Has anyone explained that yet? But the rest is just incredible : You should see the other guy? That's genius! Of course story wise they could have simplified a bit more and made it so a prequel and or sequel could be an interesting possibility.4- Photography: Visually Impressive. Every shot was a masterpiece, this movie makes Prometheus take a back seat with a vengeance. and this is a die hard Ridley Scott fan your reading BTW.I cannot even begging to imagine the amount of detail they had to put in to those open shots of panoramic when the plane or whatever is flying in full day light. I mean everything is so constant and the CG is so well blended, it was a feat. Very far and beyond those video gamy shots in well everything with heavy CG.I think this film will attract many new fans to Scy Fi but the downside is that they will not be able to find anything even close to this masterpiece.To me this movie is the best movie made in recent years, no doubt.",Oblivion

I am impressed with the Director's vision of keeping it that way and seeing the entire picture for what it was, and not taking it to a light show warp speed, saber, type of film with fictional drama and predictable love story. I am also grateful to see a good flashback that was very well done when it seems that all of Hollywood wants them gone.

I would say predictable and with some script choices quite inconsistent; the main one being the battle scene which is the ""bridge"" to the final: The first time a single drone approaches the ""scavengers"" base they have look-out posts which set an alarm; this allows them to ambush the drone and destroy it with minor losses. But when THREE drones reach the base (at the same door and possibly following the same route of the first one) no alarm goes off and the scavengers are ambushed by the drones just when they are opening the main door of their base; so the drones can literally be the ""deus ex machina"" to evolve the plot in a more tragic way: the chief of the scavengers is fatally injured and the ""trojan drone"" (that is so ""Indipendence Day"") is destroyed, so our hero will have to sacrifice himself for the good of humanity.And how come Jack can build his little personal Eden without Vica even suspecting it if she can trace him at anytime and use his on board cameras to watch what he's doing?I already wrote it: inconsistent and predictable.",Oblivion

But I must say this movie is extremely entertaining, keeps you wondering what will happen next. Of course he has numerous ""running"" scenes (it's an on going joke with my husband and myself), but very much worth watching, It kinda makes you wonder if UFO's aren't like us, but they wear disguises to protect their own identifiable anatomy!

884,medtecdawn2,Great movie,7,1 August 2015,The movie was visually spectacular. Story was very compelling. Musical score added to the feel of the movie. Tom Cruise was excellent. Morgan Freeman was too but didn't have a big part. He was wasted in my opinion. Melissa Leo was annoying with her southern drawl as Sally. I personally find most of her characters in her movies annoying. Olga Kurylenko is beautiful and does an adequate job as Julia. Andrea Riseborough showed a lot of vulnerability as Victoria. The ending felt a little rushed but is satisfying. The orange light was either a rip off or tribute to Hal in 2001 A Space Odyssey. Movie was somewhat long but I think cutting some scenes would detract from it.,Oblivion
885,sivan070,"Great movie, not all potential filled",7,28 August 2013,"While Tom Cruise's acting in the film was good, I think Jack should have been portrayed by a new face to eliminate that recognition of Jack as Tom Cruise and to allow the viewers to perceive him as an unknown person now referred to as ""Jack"". The overall acting in the film was very well done. Morgan Freeman was excellent and somehow didn't interfere with meeting his new character.The Post-apocalyptic scenery is jaw dropping and really gives the sense of exploration and adventure while watching. The drones were perfect in their visual appearance and sound design, with each drone noise your heart skips a beat and they project intenseness and power, as were the towers and power stations, the visual and graphic work is truly something to admire. The story contains great thinking and ideas that can be developed and explored creatively to produce a true masterpiece of the mind and since the writer is the director, he would have projected this creativeness on screen. But I can't get rid of that feeling that Oblivion is a work in progress and not a completed story ready to be put into the world of visual story telling. It just lacks some of the depth and detail that could be included in it, or perhaps is only in the graphic novel. It felt very short.",Oblivion
886,heArt-coder,It would be a masterpiece but they have chosen to make it shiny,7,23 July 2013,We have this alien fear for a long time. Mostly USA based film makers shown us variety of aliens than we may encounter on future.Todays science made it clear that we should first build super intelligence(like singularity project by Ray Kurzweil. Tet looks like an evil version of it.) to travel long distances on space. The next step is to build a gigantic planet eating(even sun) structure to provide energy and resources that needed. doing it and how or not is a question for humans.Knowing all of this turns this movie a social message work on my eye... like all the other ancestors. there might not be any alien but we still need movies like this to not became an alien like Tet or not create one. we have a great potential on becoming consumer of planets. just look what we are doing to our planet. great scientific developments always brings extraordinary hazards.

The first half of that movie was epic and had so much potential... and then the second half of the movie made me want to punch babies it was so bad. That was truly the most colossal piece of crap high budget film I have ever seen. I reiterate, there was SO MUCH POTENTIAL in the first half of the story. But then it was like the writers just completely gave up and threw together the second half with absurdly contrived dialogue, abandoned any semblance of continuity or appeal to reason, and abruptly reverted to the story line of Independence day (which wholly did not work). That was literally the most disappointing A-list cast movie I have ever seen.

889,davey_havok,"At best, a poor emulation of sci-fi grandeur",4,18 April 2013,"It's not great, let me start off by saying that. I don't mean to be (to used the go-to and clichéd term on IMDb) a 'hater'. I'm not. Despite Cruises many personal faults, I still think he's a terrific actor, and he usually makes great choices when it comes to scripts. This is not one of those. I understand there are countless reviews that already that discuss this films penchant for previous sci-fi works. And usually a film that pays homage to other ideas from before itself do so with reverence, and with a flair that brings something new. This film does not. This is the culmination of Hollywood producers sat in room brainstorming previous successful innovative ideas, and trying to compress them into one story that will garner the biggest box office return. The visuals were impressive, especially given the budget. I know that may seem like a silly statement, but most films nowadays on such a scale will have a budget twice as large as this film and yet still won't achieve such beauty with CGI. (The Hobbit, for example). So for this I give Oblivion high praise. However, the plot is pandering and thoroughly un-original. And again, the argument here seems to be: ""All sci-fi movies borrow from earlier works and themes."" Yes, this is true to an extent. But what most seminal works of sci-fi have in common is that they elaborate on these themes, and they in turn offer something new. This film did nothing. It took what it could from previous concepts, smashed them together into a mess of a plot, and hoped that younger audiences who wouldn't be aware of its blatant plagiarism would marvel at its supposed uniqueness. Nothing about this films plot has merit. Inspiration has its uses, and it will nurture ideas. This was simply a hack attempt to capitalise on previous works.",Oblivion

Instead Oblivion wallows in outdated heroism and 'gag me with a spoon' dialogue that reeks of someone who really thinks he is writing a classic, and so will be forgiven for making the actors utter the immortal words ""dream of us"" in order to be romantic.Wonderful visuals wasted on a boring story with no point.

Again you immersed in a post apocalyptic world where the protagonist undoubtedly overcome evil, to stay with the girl and no matter that can pass later. To enjoy a movie like this should erase our minds the thousands of similar stories we've seen, and the movie is so full of plagiarism it's absurd. is a mix between Matrix, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Independece day. attempts generate suspense in certain situations when it is obvious the outcome which will minutes later.In summary, since the beginning it was foreseeable that ""mission"" was the bad people or scavengers were human survivors, and that the protagonist would remember his past.I think if the money they invest in creating these movies fully pochocleras put her in good directors or screenwriters, would live in a better world",Oblivion

When a movie moves at a good pace with an interesting storyline, time flies and 2Hrs are not wasted watching a lovely sci-fi murder mystery set in an exciting yet believably vision of a world where not everything is what it seems.I had a feeling of ""Blade Runner"" in some scenes, that was the quality of the total package this movie delivers.",Oblivion

895,alamoon,A Sci-Fi movie that fails to give you science or fiction......,5,3 August 2013,"A good sci-fi movie should have one of these: i)It gives you enough details to satisfy your thirst or ii)It gives you enough elements to satisfy your thirst for imagination and leaves the rest to you. Unfortunately, Oblivion fails to do either of that.Why is that? It is because of the very weak plot that contains almost no background history and results in complete disappointment. I mean, seriously, a movie of this budget should not be of this class. If anything, I noticed the romance of this movie to be far more superior than the actual story. So, you may as well treat it like a romantic movie rather than science fiction.Another major flaw of this movie is that it lacks complete originality. Not that copying ideas is a sin, but building an entire movie that has every foundation taken from somewhere else is surely a sign of great weakness.To make matters worse, the talented actors/actresses of this movie have not done a satisfactory job either. Also, the movie has a childish like ending that does not follow a strong logic. If a machine is capable of taking down the whole civilization of earth, it shouldn't be dumb enough to fall for such parlor tricks.Well, there is still some good sides though - like the visual. The visual is absolutely stunning and much more realistic than we get to see. The details are just perfect. While the score is not something you will call very good but it does its job. Finally, if liked 'Tron Legacy' you'll probably find it watch worthy but those who didn't, like me, don't go for it.In a nut shell, not even close to an enjoying movie, a time passing one maybe when have nothing else.

It rather tends to stay on familiar ground dealing with typical sci-fi topics which we have seen in many other similar productions. However, 'Oblivion' is thought-provoking, engaging and manages to feel disturbingly 'real'; qualities that will probably satisfy many viewers. Add to all this its stunning visuals - courtesy of the new Sony 4K resolution camera - and you have a very interesting movie that hardly disappoints.

But no apparently not the machines are conveniently super smart when the writers/director needs them to be yet completely stupid & clueless when they don't want them to put another hole in this sinking ship of a plot...if you can call it a plot? It had one good idea when cruise's character realises that the radiated zone is in fact fabricated & it's just to stop him seeing himself (cloned) this was great & a big sort of moment in the film but then he beats him up ties him up goes to the 52tower to then return & tied up cruise is gone but it's never mentioned as if by magic? Then if that's the same cruise that helps Freeman's character at the end why would he even help? He isn't then in cruise character & suspects nothing right! Or wrong? Argh I don't even know & I don't care! Just thought I'd share some thoughts on what could have been pretty awesome yet turned out to be totally pointless?!!!",Oblivion
902,brun_v,"Entertaining, but in no way a masterpiece.",6,10 April 2013,"Coming out of the theatres following my viewing of this film, I was confused. I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.The ending was rushed, clichéd and quite cheesy, that I was sure about. But I had enjoyed the film, more or less. The visuals are stunning. The cinematography was truly impressive and I think it is these Prometheus-esque visuals (in terms of quality) that successfully manage to distract you from what is actually quite an appalling film.The storyline is shallow and the large majority of characters undeveloped (I honestly don't see much point in Morgan Freeman's character). Even after the real human faction is revealed and a group of drones rampage around massacring everyone, you just don't feel anywhere near the amount of sympathy as you should do.When the super villain is finally revealed, anyone who has seen 2001: A Space Odyssey will have immediately recognised a blown up version of Hal. The (fairly predictable) clone twist is reminiscent of Moon although it is accepted by the characters after only a couple of seconds of conflict.The first twenty minutes however, were very good (minus the lightning scene). The setting of the post apocalyptic time frame was laid out beautifully with a collection of scenes which almost reminded me of a futuristic version of I Am Legend.Yes underneath the film is a very generic amalgamation of various sci-fis that came before and it is definitely not a masterpiece in itself, but to the open minded viewer it provides more than enough to give you an easy two hours of mild entertainment and pretty landscapes.(Does anyone else question Tom Cruise's morals in stranding his wife alone in a valley for three years, thus forcing her to give birth by herself? Oh yeah and when did that happen? Hours after she was shot? Wait how did she recover?)",Oblivion

Very long, bland and very predictable. There are vast parts containing absolutely nothing, and when stuff does happen its very dull and unoriginal. Moving on,this exceedingly unsurprising film, is that you could see that right from the start where it was heading and what exactly is going to happen. The so called ""SCAVs"" were humans in disguise which wasn't a surprise at all. Cruise's character had been brain washed due to a ""mandatory memory wipe."" which wasn't very surprising at all. The one thing that I didn't see coming was that Cruise's character was a clone, and that wasn't a very effective twist at all. Acting wasn't anything special. Cruise tried his best but in my opinion fueled my view on him as being a very over rated star. And as for Kurylenko I feel that she is also an over rated actress who seems to just be a pretty Russian/Ukrainian actress. Lots of questions were left unanswered. There were continuity errors with gravity. His Elvis bobble head figure should have been floating around when he was in space. And how the hell did the flight recorder that proved so vital in the story's progression end up on earth when Cruise didn't even put it in the part of the ship he ejected before entering the alien space ship. A very poor idea, poorly executed, but annoyingly well advertised. How this movie got that much of a budget for all its advertisements and effects is criminal. I think this film will flop, and flop bad which is what it quite frankly deserves. Don't go and see it.",Oblivion

Personally I liked the never ending Twists, Action, Sci-Fi Stuffs and some major thrill points. Tom cruise has done justice to the Action sequences, but to be honest you should not expect too much or too heavy Action sequences, as this is more into Tech-stuff and humans are supposed to be protected right ;), having said so, the Action sequences actually match up to the plot!!They built some mean machine concepts which will be probably liked by most of us.I would recommend anyone who has an Interest in Sci-Fi stuffs to watch this without hesitation.But at times(though negligible) the plot goes sloppy on the Love ground, but it all adds up in the end.Just one more thing, the Concept was pretty neat.Happy Watching!!!",Oblivion

How did the other ""jacks"" know about the scavs and his wife and such...they hadn't been through the exact same events as this clone...had they? 2. I wish the movie would have gone more in depth on the war and maybe show a clip of jack being taken by the bad people or jack and his wife together during the war. 3. Who was behind the whole ""sally"" idea? There must have been someone controlling the robot..Aliens? But then the humans are not safe and they have to kill whoever was controlling sally. Maybe a sequel? But the way the movie ended suggested no sequel. Anyway, those are my only questions and/or suggestions. Everything else was just awesome!

907,ollieukmad,"Great visuals, but let down by lack of emotion",7,12 April 2013,"First of all, I would like to congratulate Joseph Kosinski for depicting lovely shots of Iceland with added effects. The landscape is epic, and the stark contrast between the slick, clean Tom Cruise and the barren wasteland is beautiful. Unfortunately, the rest of the film lacks the emotion that the scenery deserved. The lifeless and rather lacklustre performance of Andrea Riseborough as Victoria took away from the film somewhat, and Cruise as Jack Harper seemed like a paycheck for Cruise and nothing more. Morgan Freeman as the leader of the resistance was the shining star of the film, as he usually does, however he was sorely underused, adding a sense of enjoyment to the whole movie for the brief time he was in it. Olga Kurylenko as Julia also was a high point, and possibly the only serious emotional character in the film. The picture could also have explored the mythos of the apocalypse a lot more. Overall I would give the film a 7/10, as the film has a striking visual style that is let down by emotionless performances, a very interesting potential idea but a lack of closure, and under utilisation of possibly fascinating characters. Watch it if you enjoy great visuals, and don't mind a less than substantive plot.",Oblivion

The desolation of this sad future is well brought to the screen: the music helps also to involve emotionally the viewers.The plot is nothing original, but the story is well told.The special effects are also really well done, and the drones in their simplicity are just scaring and cold. The design recalls a lot the one seen in District 9 (the weapons at least).What i really didn't like was Tom Cruise. I am not talking about his performance (that in my opinion was really good), but about his presence as main action hero. Maybe this is a subjective thing, but i would have preferred to see some one else instead of him.Cool movie, anyway. One of the best Sci-Fi in the last 5 years i would say.",Oblivion

It also features several very popular and very good actors. But the plot is just terrible. A decent broad idea, but still a terrible plot. ""Plot"" is a strong word--it's more of a series of twists just to keep you on your toes, nothing really happens, and there's very little character development. There aren't even the classic elements of a plot, you know, with a rising action, climax, etc. Which is sad because of the potential that the creative and amazing special effects and all-star actors give.

It's another typical Hollywood flop, the kind we've been used to in the past 10-15 years. The plot is nothing else but a melting pot of ideas taken from other science-fiction movies, like Independence Day or Star Trek: First Contact. There's plenty of mistakes, which are almost insulting for the somebody with a little bit of know-how in the movie business (one example - where did they find the two capsules in the end?). The only positive aspect would be the special effects, but they are rather the kind one expects in 2013 in a science fiction movie.

It immediately grasped my attention as the storyline was so different than anything I have seen as of late. Tom Cruise is the perfect man for the lead role, and does not fail to deliver a good performance. If you are a relatively simple person with a short attention span you may become a bit dazed and confused as to why certain components of the film are occurring, but it adds up in the end beyond measure. Although 'Oblivion' forces you to work slightly harder than usual in understanding the plot and each twist that it takes, it all comes together very well in this thrilling yet slightly confusing film. No doubt one of Kosinski's best so far.",Oblivion
913,JayLRedfern,Fantastic example of Sci-fi,9,11 July 2013,"Stunning visuals and a play on a concept we've seen before in other ""the earth is uninhabitable"" post-apocalyptic movies. The loneliness of setting and characters adds to the great atmosphere this movie gives. The movie is also quite slow-paced but that is complimented by the isolated feel of the main characters and their roles, rather than being some gun-ho style of movie which sci-fi movies tend to be. Great soundtrack too with some tracks perfectly tied into the expected feel and sonnd of the drones. This is a great example of modern-day science-fiction without being an all-out war with alien invaders. Highly recommended.",Oblivion
914,jhinho1914,Beautiful,10,25 July 2013,"This is a very beautiful movie. I was skeptical at first but I every minute was enjoyable. From beginning to end it's got you on the tip of your seat trying to find out what's going on. The movie is long enough to trick you into thinking you know what's going on. And then they throw in a twist. Then the story continues. Once again when you think you've figured out what's going on, another twist. Then you think it's ending. Twist. Not only does this have a nicely woven twist, it's also very sentimental. It shows the passion of one man for this world. I loved how the story was written. I'm also very happy that all the important questions were answered. Doesn't leave any real big loose ends that make you feel uncomfortable or annoyed that you didn't understand what or why. Very very creative not only with the graphics and the soundtrack and sound effects, but with how they plotted the whole story. The story was consistent throughout, and the movie just keeps replaying on how well it was written over and over in your mind even after the movie. You really appreciate the creativity of the movie. There are thousands of scifi movies out there. But I have to say this is one of my favorites. Because it's not your typical alien invasion. It's a story about love, and figuring out what's going on rather than the typical adventure where you know what the story is about and you practically know how it's going to end. It does have a cliché ending, but how else are you going to finish off an alien invasion? I still think everything in this movie was brilliant.",Oblivion

The only decent part of the film, or one that I did actually sit up and pay attentive attention to was at the end, while Cruise plays the flight tape recorded of the NASA flight that found the alien ship; now that, was some good five minutes of my life. Really enjoyed it and would have liked to have seen more of that. Oh and be aware, there's the cheesiest entrance to this film that's like a very bad aftershave advert for ""old man river's cent"".I'd wait until it's on Sky as it's so slow, it would help with that Sunday roast laze that happens to us all.",Oblivion

The scary part is that co-writer Michael Arndt is in the writing team for the Hunger Games sequel and the new Star Wars trilogy!The major holes have been covered in most other reviews, so here are a few that haven't been presented. What was the Tet's plan for cloning if the NASA ship didn't accidentally happen upon it? Since Jack is a clone, why does he have memories? Usually clones are grown from birth, do the aliens have a Xerox machine that creates carbon copies?Why would they design the droids in such a way that the Scavs can so easily harvest their parts? Where was the converted water energy going, we didn't see any of it being transported? The Tet must have a novel way of producing energy to have traveled to Earth. What about the rest of the world?

I mus say that I was sorely disappointed by this flick, today. I would warn you that there are spoilers in this review, but someone spoiled this movie long before I got here.The characters are flat. The story itself just doesn't pull together. For example, Tom Cruise's character is a human ""technician"" that must somehow be required to repair machines that were originally built BY machines to destroy humans. How does THAT make any sense? So imagine an unimaginative Tom Cruise movie that took a dab of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a pinch of the Borg from Star Trek, a bit of post- apocalyptic mankind from Mad Max, a smidgen of pod racing from Star Wars, a bit of The Matrix and a dash of Independence Day. Mix well, let steep until rotten, project on a screen at $8 or more a pop. Trust me: you've seen this movie done better. Avoid until it's on Blue Ray for $1.50.

922,costaricacommune,IRONY: A Clone of the film Moon,6,21 July 2013,"To keep it short, I will begin promptly.INCONSISTENCIES:1. In a world of drones, aliens, and motherships, why couldn't they get their radios to work for basic two-way communications? Yes, I realize he flew ""below radar"", but we're talking about aliens completely destroying the moon... Surely they can figure out radios.2. Again - n a world of drones, aliens, and motherships, why couldn't Jack be tracked with an RFID chip as well as his ship. He's always cruising around and no one knows where he is... ever heard of GPS? I mean, if you can blow up an entire moon, and destroy an entire planet, you'd think that tracking your spacecraft would be pretty standard...3. The guns... Morgan Freeman has a blaze of glory battle with a basketball robot, and unloads a copious amount of shells into it - yet it doesn't die. In fact, it knocks Freeman on his ass, and keeps on killin. 30 seconds later, a drone is shot with a rifle and drops like a fly. In an earlier scene, we can see Jack shoot a drone with his pistol, and drops it like nothing. Very inconsistent (even if there's a ""sweet spot"" for them to target, it's still pretty lame).4. The scenery vs. the story - What the hell? With millions of dollars worth of C.G., this is the best story you can come up with? Mad Max meets Moon? The entire story is based on the idea that an Alien is using Jack as a tool to help repair assets. Jack is a clone, and he doesn't know it. He later meets his wife and kills the aliens with Morgan Freeman, and they die as martyrs (typical Hollywood martyrdom). See Star Trek 2009 intro scene.5. How did Jack's wife get on the shuttle that was pulled into the mothership (Tent)? Additionally, how did it orbit for 60 years? I'm going to have to watch it a second time to catch up on that part.UNORIGINALITY:1. A knock off from the movie Moon? Jack - your typical ""tech. dude"", works on automated equipment that helps procure natural resources from Earth. Jack has memories lingering up in his cage, and he struggles to remember himself. Slowly, he realizes it's a lie... The rest is nonsensical Mad Max type action scenes.2. Tractor beams, lasers, and motherships - yes, this is an alien film without the grays. There are a few power-cells and radiations too...3. A clone of the movie Moon... how pun-tastic.4. Two-way radios still being used 100 years from now... ?5. GPS - Why are the aliens so technologically advanced and yet so incredibly out of date? 6. Morgan Freeman's Accessories - Cigar, Trench Coat, and Driving Goggles. AKA - Mad Max Wardrobe AMBIGUITIES:1. How did Jack have enough time to build a secret resort without anyone knowing about it? I mean seriously...2. Why did the creepers at the beginning squeal like pig-men and then later reveal that they were simply humans?3. How did Morgan Freeman know more about Jack than the aliens?4. At one point in the film, Jack randomly finds a book, reads a specific page, and Morgan Freeman knew it... how? Seriously...5. Rope + Winch = Nylon Snap. Meanwhile, you have flying spaceships and drones capable of voice recognition. I apologize - it's 4:00am, and I must sleep. Way too much money for such a generic/recycled story.

Beautiful and as capturing as they get, the visuals keep the audience in awe. Also, this is Tom Cruise's best performance in recent years. The story may not be as rich as they made in olden days, it still manages to keep you engaged in its proceedings and offers enough twists (some actually very good ones) to hold you to it. I particularly found the background score the next best thing after its cinematography. Charged with tense tunes and thrilling energy, it perfectly complements the proceedings. At a runtime of 124 minutes, the length allows the movie to setup its characters and plot at an easy pace and saves Oblivion from a being a rushed up attempt.It's a good watch and a must for all Tom Cruise fans.",Oblivion
924,hadockjohn,Kosinski Too Talented for Technophobic Clichés,7,23 April 2013,"I have mixed feelings about Oblivion, but I'd recommend a watch nonetheless.First, the cinematography is one of the most beautiful I've seen, perhaps the best one to date in science-fiction. It is certainly on par with Tron: Legacy, if not more spectacular even. Just for that, Oblivion is worth the entry cost. And I don't regret watching the film if it helps Kosinski to keep doing this sort of awesome visual work.On the other hand, I have some issues with the plot. At some point in the film, I thought we would get a very nice metaphysical reflection. But unfortunately, the story falls into the common traps of uninspired sci-fi writers, like technophobia. The many plot twists also tend to blur the philosophical content. The screenwriters want to tell too much and seem to lose their focus along the way. Tom Cruise deserves credit for his excellent performance in the leading role. Andrea Riseborough is very good, too. The rest of the cast is either less convincing, or underexploited.Oblivion is a good entertainment, and certainly worth watching, but I'm sure Kosinski could do even better next time.",Oblivion

Other than special effects this movie has little to commend itself. The plot takes a long time to develop and after it does you find yourself wishing it had not. It appears that the script was written by a committee who did nothing but sit around a table referencing scenes from other, much better movies. If Tom Cruise does not give a strong nod to Will Smith from at least 2 other works (Independence Day and I, Robot) then he should be ashamed. Let's list the movies that Oblivion ripped off: 2001 a Space Odyssey, Planet of the Apes, Independence Day, Star Wars, War of the Worlds, I Robot, Terminator 3, The Matrix, and Caddyshack.

The story isn't bad at all. In fact, you understand more and more when you begin the film, if in a moment you don't understand something, it could be normal because it's intended. Tom Cruise, as always, is an excellent actor, he didn't make a lot of science-fiction film but here I'm really impressed, he proved us that he is also good in this kind of film. In the beginning, I found really weird to wear a NY cap in a destroyed field but, once again, I understood why. I am also disappointed (not really disappointed but it just would be nice)that Morgan Freeman wasn't enough present in the film but I think it's normal as a supporting actor. Anyway, he is awesome!I also found really weird how humans die when drones kill them, they disappear instantaneously, not convenient for a death but maybe it was the science-fiction side.

Cruise is as good as ever and the supporting cast fill their roles well. Second I would say that the cinematography is rather good also. At some points I found myself wide-eyed, admiring the image on screen. Last but not least I would also say that the overall aesthetics of the film are pretty decent. The design of the world is interesting and eye-catching. The special effects are pretty tip top. All of these elements save the film from being a complete failure.The dark side to this film however lies in it's story, it's narrative. The film is far too long - it has too many acts. The audience is slowly spoon-fed each tiny detail even though is only takes the first 20 minutes (AT MOST) to figure out basically whats going on and what will happen (this isn't helped by the trailer for the film as it reveals too much). There is nothing really hidden in this film for too long (even if you haven't seen the trailer) as you are suspicious of just about everything that the main characters take for granted and (hopefully I'm not giving anything away or *spoiling* the film) you are right to suspect these things. I don't believe this film gives the viewer too much credit. As I have said it is slow. This is not only due to the endless details being spoon-fed but also the relentlessness of the action scenes, where you will find yourself sitting around waiting for the next plot point to come up. It distinctly feels as if the audience is faster than the film and the audience is just not being challenged at all.So, should the film be cast into oblivion? Or does it deserve a chance? Well I would say that it's average. Not really worth paying to see but in a few years if it's on television on a quiet Sunday afternoon maybe watch it and see what you think. If you really like it then fair enough, but in the end you can't really argue that it's much more than a film factory Tom Cruise vehicle - with some sci-fi bells and whistles on it.",Oblivion

934,mhhrobbins,Visually stunning Science fiction,8,10 April 2013,"The new film from the director Joseph Kosinski who directed 2010's Tron Legacy, has two things going for it, his brilliant visual style and a brilliant score this time provided by M83 rather than Daft Punk who scored Tron Legacy. The film is rapturously beautiful, it was filmed with 4K cameras which is definitely the way in which to see it as it was stunning. The film stars Tom Cruise who can make anything watchable (as he did with Knight and Day, barely) and he brings a familiar face for somewhere completely foreign territory, as the world has been devastated by a war for earth. He is joined by Morgan Freeman who does not feature as much as the poster would have you believe, also Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko. The best thing about the film is the action which works very well and we have a Texan Melissa Leo at mission control who is a figure of mystery and plays to some of the more interesting parts of the film such as who creation and the feeling of home, which Cruise does. The film has the tag-line ""Earth is a memory worth fighting for"" and this film is definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen with the best projector possible.",Oblivion
935,matt-evanchak,This movie is a rip off of Moon with a bigger Hollywood effects budget. Watch Moon instead of this!,2,19 April 2013,"This movie was very disappointing based only on the complete unoriginality of the movie. Visually, this movie hit a home run, very cool images of the effects of Earth without the moon with little touches of landmarks that we would all recognize and connect with. Based on that statement you would think well the story can't be that bad right? Well, no. First, the movie was so slow. It took forever to develop and I found it hard to follow. I felt I was thinking a lot during the movie, ""Just get on with it already!"" Next, the movie was just unoriginal in every little detail. There was a fight between a spaceship and some drones and it looked like it was straight out of Star Wars. The thing that I was most upset about was the obvious rip off of the movie Moon with Samuel Rockwell. Both of these movies contained the same twist in that the main character were both clones working on a distant planet helping the rest of the population elsewhere. Moon was more of a psychological thriller where as this movie lacks this psychological part and tries to make up for it by looking really pretty, but it just wasn't enough. Overall, I left the movie angry because they took a great idea in Moon and just added special effects to it to make Oblivion. Don't watch this movie, watch Moon instead and you will be much happier. Visually this movie earns an 8/10 but because of the slow pace and lack of originality I gave this movie a 2 out of 10.",Oblivion
936,pdavi43,"Good visual effects, but lacking common sense and a clear plot.",3,10 April 2013,"I went to see this movie this afternoon, holding high hopes. I had seen the trailer, and was keen to switch my mind off for a few hours and just enjoy the movie.Unfortunately, I couldn't switch my mind off during this movie, as it was so filled with inaccuracies and flaws that I found it impossible to actually enjoy it. It got to a point where I could think of nothing but everything wrong that was happening. This movie, set in the much too near future for any of the technology presented to be plausible, is about Jack Harper, a man left on Earth with his assigned partner after Earth's moon has been destroyed by extra terrestrials, and although the human race has won the war, they have been forced to leave Earth and live on Saturn's moon, Titan. He travels about his futuristic helicopter, in search of damaged drones. Throughout the movie, so many painfully obvious flaws in the story line and general scientific inaccuracies are seen that I lost count. Although many sci-fi movies are lacking in scientific accuracy, Oblivion really sets a new low. It was clearly directed toward those lacking enough intelligence and common sense to realize how flawed the movie is, and yet the story line and plot was very difficult to follow and understand. Without giving any spoilers, I feel as though the writer had a very clear idea when he began writing, and then he slowly lost direction of where the movie was going, and suddenly ended it with a convenient, yet horribly disappointing ending. I believe the writer attempted to make a movie full of life-changing revelations, much like The Matrix, although lacking the intelligence that The Matrix held. However,The visual effects displayed in this film really are pleasing to the eye, and only the just make the movie bearable. This being said, stunning visual effects don't make up for stupidity.

938,michael-p-ross,Pleasantly Surprised,8,11 April 2013,"I'm not sure why some people seem to utterly hate this film. Although there are some bad points, there's nothing that would merit a score of 0/10. It's unfortunate that some people would prefer to make an attention seeking statement rather than fairly rate a movie.I was expecting to be disappointed by this film - big budget, Tom Cruise, heavy on special effects - it seemed inevitable that it would be a damp squib but it wasn't.There's very little novel about the story, which seems to be an amalgam of concepts from many other films. Luckily, though, they are all good concepts from good films - Independence Day, The Matrix, Moon, The Terminator, 2001 all make an appearance.The pace is good for the most part, perhaps a little slow in places, and the special effects are well executed and visceral. The story is interesting if not groundbreaking and the twist is not exactly what you'd expect; although very early on you will realise that all is not as it is made out to be.You shouldn't walk into the cinema with unrealistic expectations. This isn't a cerebral film. Your mind won't be blown. You won't see stunning performances or deeply moving dialogue. If you are looking for ""art"" then stay away. If you are a sci-fi fan looking for a bit of decent escapism then I would recommend Oblivion. The best £4 I've spent at the cinema in a while.",Oblivion

Some decent twists. And the effects and the scenery were all awesome. There were no problems with the acting. Maybe some people just didn't understand the story. I could see that. If you're stupid.

But movies are not just about actors and scenes. It should have an attractive story to support it. And storytelling should be done well, this is what Oblivion failed to do.Oblivion spends too much time (probably half the movie) as an introduction. By the time 90% of the audience got the point, it kept on going and going.And there are so many plots which do not make a very good sense, I won't point them out, you can see them by yourselves.However, Oblivion's world of Sci-Fiction is very pleasant if you are a fan of sci-fiction, although it was quite a surprise to see a motorbike with two wheels.Overall, a decent movie with stunning CG and actors,but no where close to be a superb movie.**Don't expect too much action scenes either!",Oblivion

Well though many of the reviews here are fair, there are many that seem to exist to show their hate for anything sci-fi. They just don't seem to get it, and therefore love to say how much they hate it.Many people are saying this is nothing new because there are elements that remind the viewer of films like the matrix, moon, independence day etc., but that's just like giving any rom-com a 0/10 because it contains kissing and laughing, a break up and a get together. On to the film... I wasn't expecting much, the trailer gave no indication for a developing story-line at all, and though most Tom Cruise films are entertaining, they're never exactly high-brow. How I was proved wrong. It is well written, imaginative, thrilling, epic, emotional, and never forced. it's more than enough to pick up sci-fi reputation after Prometheus dropped it. It's easy to pick one or two could-be-holes, but just as easy to use your brain and fill them in yourself. Just watch it; if you respect sci-fi, then you won't be disappointed.Also great music by M83, a few tracks noticeably similar to tracks from TDKR, but can't exactly blame them, and they're not the only ones capitalising on Batman's success in the music department.",Oblivion
944,bruno-de-marques,Great Sci-Fi pic. Definitely worth big screen watch.,10,12 April 2013,"- - SPOILERS BELOW - - - I've really enjoyed this movie. A ""must see"" for sci-fi fans. Period. The aesthetics and designs are fantastic and I didn't find the plot predictable as it is said in other reviews. Nitpicking a bit: Unfortunately, though, it follows Hollywood's not-so-recent trend of ""same but different"" plots. For those who like Sci-Fi and, like me, try to see everything that comes out, you will undoubtedly find in Oblivion traces of the ""The 6th Day"", ""Moon"", ""Independence Day"" and certainly others. That said, it's not a bad thing. It's actually rather difficult (not to say impossible) to come out with a plot which is 100% fresh. Plot Tension also came a long way since ""Tron Legacy"" but some viewers may find it a bit slow at times. Personally, I like it just the way it is. A few issues: I found odd that when the ship with the bomb entered the Tate, it didn't recognize it was 52's and not 49's And, before that, that Repairman 49 wouldn't know that there should be, at least, another 48 others like him around they may not look like him, but there would be others. I don't think this issue is clear in the movie – since he never met any other except the other clone in the contaminated zone. I also have trouble understanding why the scavengers walked funny (like fast crabs?) before he knew they were human – maybe it's just how the clone saw them in his mind before knowing the truth - but I still think it's a rather ""cheap"" trick so viewers would not guess - right away - that Scavengers were actually human. As I've said, this is ""nitpicking"" – it's a fantastic movie and I will definitely buy it in Blu-Ray (or 4K), when it comes out.",Oblivion

And of course, a Tom Cruise action story wouldn't be complete without a Hot Love Interest to expand appeal beyond the sci-fi crowd.Yes, clichés are abound in this movie and if you were hoping for a fresh new sci-fi mind-exploder, this isn't it. Instead, the writers have combined many well-accepted sci-fi concepts and thrown them together to produce a lukewarm plot. Anyone who has seen Wall-E, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, The Matrix, and similar movies will notice more than a few things in common between the stories.While the acting is of reasonable quality, the visuals and music are what really stand out. Most of the landscapes, architecture and props (basically the entirely movie) are made with CGI and they are nothing short of breathtaking, thanks to excellent cinematography and other things that no one understands. Nothing fell short in the soundtrack department either, with an excellent combination of futuristic electronic and a sweeping orchestra by Anthony Gonzalez of M83 and Joseph Trapanese.Nothing ground-breaking, but certainly a well-constructed, solid movie in most respects.",Oblivion

He is ably assisted by the other cast members but the win goes to Freeman. His understated performance hit the right note for a film of this size and scope. The story twists at a nice pace and the action is not over-extended. All in all, this is a fine film and a future benchmark for the genre. This being Kosinsky's second film he must be praised for a work so detailed and entertaining. Better than Tron Legacy and a new marker in his journey in Hollywood.

Seeing the film in theater was an emotionally charged, theatrical roller-coaster. The script, simplistic yet charming and intriguing. The soundtrack, a complimentary masterpiece to the futuristic feel of the time period, yet subtle enough to capture the underlying romance tones represented between the protagonists.

I strongly believe that no other film has more brilliantly shown the Earth after Apocalypse.

Ouch.What's wrong with it? Just a short summary: 1) A house standing on only one pole several hundred meters in the sky, and isn't affected by the wind. 2) Highly sophisticated robots with worthless software because the damn things can't shoot straight, or at least, can't hit the main characters but can make a one-shot-one-kill to figurants/extras (even more stupid than in the Terminator-movies) 3) A planet-consuming giant space-robot who's too stupid to see through a simple deception (ending of the movie) 4) The planet-consuming giant space-robot looks like HAL2000 5) A totally barren planet with a 'secret' oasis, and somehow this oasis was only discovered by Tom's character nor affected by the global catastrophes. And the robots, nor the resistance seems to have discovered this place. 6) Awfully slow movie. Just enough storyline to fill an hour instead of two. 7) And again; stupid robots/AI. Come on people. Once the evil space-robot/AI-thingy discovered the rebel-hideout, it sends 3 killerbots. Once these killerbots are destroyed, none follow directly. I mean, this is 2013 people. We've got smartphones, programs that can do the thinking for you. So imagine where we would be a 100 years in the future. The plot, and especially the behaviour of the robots, seems to be made up in the 70's or so.And can someone tell me when the kid at the end of the movie was conceived? Surely not after the first raid on the rebel-hideout.Not only do I want my time & money back, I also would like to see an apology from the makers. If you are to decide to make an sci-fi, make it a believable one. Start reading Asimov or something, that man thought about technological advancements and consequences.

952,seansebastian1990,Oblivion: Sci-Fi Nerd Heartbreaker.,6,17 April 2013,"I'm sorry sci-fi nerds - and I use the term lovingly - this is another fascinating fictional world marred by its big-budget aim on audiences other than yourselves. Based on the graphic novel of the same name and creator, Oblivion is a plausibly constructed sci-fi world, even if it lacks the intrigue it was aiming for. Jack Harper (Cruise) and his companion, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), have been commissioned by the human race to defend energy generators from Scavengers: an alien race that have lost the war for Earth, but remain in covert pockets across the globe. Supposedly, Earth was rendered inhospitable for humans and the surviving population has taken refuge on a monumental space station. There are issues with the premise and the world Joseph Kosinski has crafted here. The film's dreary progression fuels your skepticism, instead of placating it. The final reveal does settle most logical qualms and leaves a comfortable amount of ambiguity, even if you've completely checked out halfway through. In it's strain to bend your mind, the film goes on to twist itself into oblivion, blending up common sci-fi elements and not-so-subtly referencing the classics. But it does so far too slowly, drawing attention to inconsistencies and implausibilities and attempting to shift your focus to character development. Unfortunately, even weaker still are the human elements in the film; characters who fit neatly into their linear roles and actors who play them with mind-numbing simplicity. As always, Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise. There isn't a role in which he's 'playing' quiet or brooding that doesn't make you wish he would retire. Oblivion is no exception. Jack Harper is simply an American guy and that's about all you can bring yourself to care about. Even Morgan Freeman playing Morpheus isn't enough to make you sympathise with the human race. The narrative is actually engaging and it's a crying shame the structure of the film simply leaves nothing to grasp to.Technically, Oblivion is a step up from the visual brilliance of Tron: Legacy. Kosinski's reliance on CGI is saved by its complete cohesion with the actors and thankfully, you won't see any awkward renderings of Jeff Bridges wondering through the frame. The film is visually ambitious, certainly, but it doesn't go all Matrix: Reloaded and try too much. The post-apocalyptic landscape is actually beautifully shot and the film offers wonderful sweeping shots of mangled landmarks against foreboding mountain backdrops, drawing just enough attention to itself to dilute the film's sedative side-effects. Oblivion refuses to strap on its spectacles and delve into the finer details of its own world. Whether due to a heavy studio presence or simply due to Kosinki's own insecurities, this is a film fascinating enough to make you wish it was far more absolute. The first Matrix is an archetypal sci-fi and did everything I wish Oblivion had. It was ballsy enough to lecture you for an hour about its rules and only then reward you with snippets of ingenious action. It never got bogged down in drip-feeding intrigue or caught in the attempt to be anything else. Oblivion, while containing merit, is disappointing. *Piece also appears on http://telaveev.blogspot.com.au/",Oblivion

The thing that stands out is the premise: The good guys are a bunch of freedom fighters, living in caves in a desert created by laying waste to the planet, being hunted by killer drones sent by a faceless imperialist power that is only interested in stripping resources, and uses their own kind against them. Hmmm. This is a bit familiar. Disturbingly the freedom fighters win the battle by nuking the multinational-corporation, um, I mean alien robots. Ironic? Or what?Kind of derivative. Acting a bit minimalist - can never tell whether intention or not in Hollywood. On the other hand the twist in the tail was done reasonably well. Saturn's moon an unlikely destination for humanity - Jupiter is a lot closer. Not to mention Mars! At one point Jack 49 is shot in the chest, but not apparently injured.

956,shamoke-664-726076,A faithful adaption to the blockbuster RPG!,8,20 April 2013,"So I heard they were making a movie based on the game Oblivion and I thought it was going to be great. Starring Tom Cruise and directed by Peter Jackson. What could go wrong I said? Well yesterday I went to the theatre with a few of my closest friends, friends I used to talk to about Oblivion all the time. I remember the first time we all rang each other up and were in a conference call together. We talked for hours about how this was it, this was the future of RPGs. There was no limits to the game. We could do anything and go anywhere. We talked, laughed and cried. The game was incredible and I remember fondly how we all shared our experiences together. How we explored some remote dungeon in the far off wilderness and uncovered another piece of spectacular armor. How the monsters scaled in difficulty. The game was always a challenge. The dialogue was great, and sir Patrick Stewart was amazing. I can't thank the game industry enough from bringing me something so cherished. Thank you Oblivion I will always remember you.But now it is time to talk about this movie. First off let me just say the CGI was beautiful. Masterful even, if you are a fan of great action and CGI you will be pleased. I was a little sad when I didn't see one mountain lion, or anything. No mud crabs running around either. Those were a great part of the game. Also, the magic in the movie was not as overt as in the game. Morgan Freeman was totally a high level mage in the movie, but you didn't see him cast spells really. I thought it was clever that all the clones signified saves in the game, and I also liked how the world was so vast and Tom Cruise explored it just like Oblivion. There were caves, houses and even a few dungeons. The movie had a lot of flying. Maybe that was some foreshadowing about the dragons to come. I don't know. I was just really confused by the whole thing, but in a good way. It really stayed true to the story with all the Oblivion gates that had to be destroyed, and even threw in a great twist that the main character lost his memory which was a welcomed change from the original game's story. That sure kept me guessing till the very end! I'll give the movie an 8 out of 10. It is pretty close to the game, but there are some differences like I don't think the empire state building is in the game.",Oblivion
957,aturnerc7,A lot of plot holes..(Spoiler Alert),5,20 April 2013,"First off, it was a good movie with great effects, casting, and acting. The story line was also great, but there are so many plot holes that make this movie that could have been an 8 or 9 down to a 5. 1.) Jack 49 somehow knows the outcome of the 2017 Superbowl, when in the flashback, the original Jack says he doesn't want Sally to ruin the outcome for him. 2.) When Jack and Julia meet, Julia wants to get the flight recording back from the remains of the ship. We later find out that the remains of the ship are from the ""escape pod"" part of the ship, while Jack and Victoria were flying in the cockpit. Why would the flight recording be in the pod and not the cockpit? 3.) Julia describes her mission. The thing is, how could Julia know the mission was reassigned, if she was in Delta sleep so she could get to Titan? 4.) At the end of the movie, Jack 52 finds Julia at the cabin after 3 years. With some of the memories the original Jack had and memories of Jack 49. Does this mean thousands of the Jacks will show up at the cabin? 5.) How in the heck did Julia give birth alone? Surely she didn't have to rip the umbilical cord with her bare hands. 6.) What happened to all the other clones on Earth? They would have been paranoid thinking that all the life that was going to be transported to Titan from the TET. was destroyed and they were the only humans left, stranded on the planet. 7.) One question I'm sure everyone is asking. Where did the TET. come from? Was it an alien-made space-ship and grew a terrible conscience or what? Is it a species and are there more of them out there?",Oblivion

She said after the movie that it was one of the best she has seen. This was not a ""scary sci-fi"" but a thoughtful well presented movie. It was an excellent movie! We saw it on base here in Naples. The special effects are fantastic! Our base dose not have very good projection equipment but the movie was great. The storyline was a real surprise at the end. the aircraft and the drones were really cool. It is amazing to think... where we will be in the future......

It is completely unoriginal;- the story is a rip off of a movie called Moon (which stars Sam Rockwell and is superbly acted). While visually stunning this does not add enough value to the film given how truly dreadful the acting is- and yes i do mean cruise who looks slightly constipated throughout the movie. If you want a movie with substance that will keep you engaged, and give you food for thought this is not for you. If you want something which is thinly veiled attempt to show of CGI and relaunch Tom Cruise into the mainstream then go for.

Throughout the film I was impressed with the visual effects and was taken back by how this film created such an outstanding plot. This film left me feeling and wondering... It quite honestly left me speechless and it is hard even now to construct what I'm saying. The reason why this film deserves great credit is because when a film is presented to an audience, the idea is for the audience to be captivated in the story. Sort of like loosing your self into another world where the film puts you. This is the what happened to myself, I really felt I was in this world and was convinced! If you feel like leaving your day to day life behind for a couple of hours this is a film that will take you. Overall, this is a film not to be forgotten with a brilliant new edge on world apocalypse, brilliantly performed and outstanding directing.I recommend this film to anyone.",Oblivion
964,Tyrusjoseph-667-574142,A very good sci fi story that's full of realistic plots...a possible future for earth and mankind.,10,23 April 2013,"There's a lot of true science in this film, since its not some cheap flick. It's a Tom Cruise. And it's the only reason I had to go see it and it didn't disappoint. There are some factors which I really like. One being how the moon was destroyed by aliens which caused massive destruction on earth. What a powerful event that if any aliens our there would know to do, it's a smart thing they would do, ... Destroy the moon and earth will collapse momentarily. Great point. I've seen tons on UFO movies but none which aliens used their minds to create such true science conclusion. I love it. The idea stands out in the movie the most to me. Secondly, jack and Victoria DNA was used for cloning multiple techs to monitor earth is very well a possible idea aliens can do to use humans to work for them, which is what most scientists believed about the ancient gods, or Zachariah sitchin books depicts. How humans where created or made to work for them, as how we today build machines and robots. Wonderful idea in this conclusion. No movie is perfect. No director nor book writers got it all figured out. After all, its still only just a movie for us to enjoy, and not some real documentary of any known UFO factuals. But given the technology we have today and the geology studies and astronomy research, this movie makes good sense. I give it a 10 for its pure fun and interesting science conclusions and plots. I also like to give a 10 for Tom Cruise on his success in this film because when it comes to sci fi, only he and will smith has movies worth watching.",Oblivion
965,scotch1100,Rock Solid,9,24 April 2013,"Some movie reviewers are just not up to watching SciFi. It's the only reason for tepid reviews to me. If it ain't StarWars or StarTrek they won't get it.No movie is perfect including this one. My very lightweight knocks on Oblivion are: 1) You won't leave the theater meditating on the meaning of life, the universe or human consciousness (like say The Matrix Part 1, or Inception). 2) You won't deeply hate the antagonist when he/she/they/it get what is so richly deserved. It's there, because it has to be there, but it's not over-sold.Oblivion is nowhere near as complex as Avatar, StarWars, StarTrek etc, but it IS a complete story and well told. The entire plot holds together for me, with a very few (non-fatal) glitches.Seeds for the plot twists are there, but you may not catch them so you can be surprised. You will be amazed at the set designer's earth-based mechanicals and architecture (stuff that might even humble a Steve Jobs). Watch for the swimming pool. Off-planet stuff looks like the work of a different crew, over-reaching and derivative, but minor.The characters are well written, directed and acted. You will like Cruise's lead character immediately (unlike say John Carter or the Great and Powerful Oz). ""The Camera Loves Him"" - even at age 50 with Cruise's face touching 3-4 sides of the screen. He can also ACT that close up. You will like his character in part because he is well written, but also well directed and very well acted. Tom's real-life wacky SciFi faith might have cost him two amazing wives, but it didn't take away his ability to perform. Might even help, a topic for another day. I say: Rock-solid SciFi storytelling. You'll get your money's worth, even if you buy the big popcorn and a drink... and IMAX.",Oblivion
966,reinierovertoom,Oblivion - Proper SF despite a couple of pretty serious mistakes,7,25 April 2013,"Summary: The world was attacked by the Scavengers. They destroyed the moon, which caused many natural disasters across the planet. The war was eventually won by the humans after deploying nuclear weaponry, but afterward the planet was mostly uninhabitable. The humans now live on Titan, a moon of Saturn, apart from a few who stayed behind in a large space station, or on earth, where large machines now harvest water for fusion energy. Some remaining Scavengers continue to disrupt that process. Drones defend the machines, and a few humans remain to repair the drones if they get damaged.Jack (Cruise) is such a repairman. Assisted by his communications partner and girlfriend Vika (Riseborough) he finds damaged drones and repairs them, or takes them back to his base/home if he doesn't have the parts to repair them on the spot. Jack often dreams of a woman (Kurylenko), and is haunted by several ""memories"" that he is not supposed to have because of a memory wipe he had to undertake for security reasons. This causes him to question the things around him, and gets him into trouble. I will stop here, because otherwise I will reveal too much.Oblivion is a post-apocalyptic SF movie with a couple of upsides and a couple of downsides. Let me start with the downsides, so I can end on a positive note. ;-)1. The movie contains lots of plot ideas that were already used in other movies. It's not a one on one copy of another SF movie, but there are many things that are not very original.2. The movie is pretty predictable. There were many plot twists that I saw coming, even though I am pretty naive when I am watching movies. I didn't really mind this, but I am sure some will.3. There is a pretty extensive list of mistakes they made in the movie. Some of them bothered me a bit, most of them not really, but if you are a severe critic when watching movies, they might stop you from enjoying the movie. Other reviews reveal that this is a serious possibility.4. The acting isn't perfect. Cruise does a decent job, but the problems arise with the supporting cast. They just don't seem to get the chance to have their characters develop properly. Freeman should have had way more screen time, and Riseborough also doesn't get the chance to make Vika grow on us. Kurylenko does get quite some time to have her character develop, but she seems to just underperform. Not sure who is to blame here though. Might be the director's fault instead of Kurylenko's.Now, enough with the criticism. Time for some upsides! And the movie deserves a positive end note, because I enjoyed watching it a lot, despite of its flaws.1. Visually, the movie is spectacular! The large machines look great, the destroyed moon looks great, the action scenes are really nice and the combat drones are outright frightening. Their speed and efficiency are really impressive. The landscapes from the destroyed planet Earth are also very beautifully made.2. The plot, though somewhat unoriginal and containing many errors, is actually really interesting. The starting point is nice, and there are many twists that I liked. An SF fan should definitely not be disappointed by it. If we compare this plot to say Star Trek (2009) or the Transformers movies, it is quite a relief to finally watch a proper story again.3. The speed of the movie is very good! If you read other reviews, you will find that some thought the movie was slow. Perhaps they liked the speed of the last Total Recall movie, but normal movie fans will find one big roller-coaster of action sequences and special effects just tiring and pointless. The slower pace in Oblivion helps us familiarize with the characters and the story. If the movie would have been any faster than this, the story would have become one big mess and we would not at all have been able to enjoy character development (which I feel was already lacking a bit in the current pace).Conclusion: I would rate this movie a 7/10. Yes, there are many flaws, but I enjoyed the movie a lot, and there is lots to enjoy about it. Most SF movies have plot errors, but that's what you get if you make a movie with a complex plot, action sequences, special effects, a love story and so on. SF movies are never perfect, and this one is a solid effort. To a general audience I would say 'mildly recommended'. For SF fans it's a must see, though it probably won't become your all time favorite.",Oblivion

Try not to find the things, focus what would happen next... because this is science fiction movie not thriller nor mystery. This movie is great when you look at how well story is spread out with music (if you watched with IMAX, you would know it is just the best work on sound) as well as the emotions/ mood created each moment. I have never felt satisfied after watched a movie like this before! Don't watch this movie with bias like ""oh it is tom cruise"" ""oh this doesn't have great something.. blah blah"" Watch this without comparing with any other sci-fic movie. This movie is different than other sci-fic packed with actions nor crazy sci-fic effects. One sentence describing the ""Oblivion""..

This movie had nothing special, some laser beams, flying golf balls with guns and an upside down floating pyramid. The storyline had you wondering the entire movie, what??? I never in my life fell asleep during a movie twice. I forced myself to wake up, thinking I was missing something only to find out I missed nothing. The only thing I missed out on was a good nap. While I was sleeping I would hear an explosion and wake up instantly thinking ""Oh my god, you're missing the action!! WAKE UP!!"" but when I opened my eyes it would all be over. I asked my wife ""What did I miss?"" only to find her snoring away. I'm shocked this movie has received 7 stars. It should receive 2 stars at most as that's how many famous stars are acting in it. Hollywood keeps wondering why people are stealing their movies online. It's cause they keep putting out junk like this. I'm sure the Tom Cruise fans will love it just because he is in it.",Oblivion

Visual effects are good, but plot of this movie evolves in a very slow pace with only few surprises. Therefore this movie is boring. I could have tell the plot of this movie to a friend in a 5 minutes. The thing is that this 5 minutes is extended to 2 hours. Such a disappointment. Not even Morgan Freeman appearance in this movie could save it and when I say appearance I mean appearance as he may be at the movie maybe for 5 minutes. Maybe a little longer. There are a few logical holes in the plot. The story of the movie was the major flaw for me. It seems like there wasn't much thought put into it. Filmmakers just patched scenes together with visual effects somehow following the story enough for this movie to be presented to the public.

972,cpowell974,Did not live up to its potential...,4,1 May 2013,"Wellanother movie that did not live up to its potential. The premise of this movie was great. The story was not. It lacked serious development and really fell flat. The story seems more like a pitch developed for the producers. ""This movie will be about this and that involving him and her and a few others with this and that action thrown in and this is how it all will turn out. And, hey, Tom Cruise wants to be in it!"" About half way through the movie I started to feel terribly disappointed. OKto be honest, I felt disappointed after the prologue. Part of a great movie is letting the story unfold as it happens. What do they say about writing a good story?—show don't tell!I want to care about the characters in a movie. I'm a very sensitive guy—I cry at the drop of a hat. Seriously, I didn't once feel for any of the characters in this film—nary had a tear well up in my eyes. The science fiction portion of the film was never seriously developed either. There was just too much bouncing back and forth between a love story and the science fiction story of which neither engaged. It seemed like the writers and director were trying to make a love story with a science fiction subplot. Unfortunately, they failed on both accounts.How about the action? Some of the action stuff was a bit unbelievable. The scenes involving the drones seemed terribly unrealistic. However, with that said, there wasn't too much action—there just wasn't enough of anything else.I love science fiction when done well. I like love stories when done well. The potential was great for both in this movie. I think all the actors did a good job—the writing and direction were just not up to snuff. This was just another one of those movies that you wish you could go back a do all over. I believe script writers, producers and directors should take the lead from authors who write great stuff—sometimes you have to do it over and over and over again to get it right. The first couple of drafts are rarely worthy of publication.(OhSound effects were great; however, I didn't really see any advantage to this movie being done in IMAX. Most of the scenes just seemed flatmuch like the story. And, I have to disagree with those that loved the soundtrack...it didn't' do much for me either.)",Oblivion

I recently watched Scavengers, just for comparison, an excellent B-movie in my opinion which had more convincing directing than this. This movie gives the word 'generic' a whole new meaning. I wouldn't even consider this sci-fi (due to lack of realism) but rather fantasy romance/drama.This movie is an excellent example for what happens if you want to reach the largest audiences by finding the lowest common denominator. Mindless action sequences paired with romance, emotional waffling and a story directed so overly simplified that it can easily be understood by 3 year olds.

When you continue to think about a movie for several days after watching it, you know it really had an impact and succeeded in captivating your thoughts and attention.I loved that it didn't focus solely on special affects or action.

A few times I caught myself whispering things like, ""whoa, that's crazy"", or ""didn't expect that""... Not something I usually do throughout a movie.

976,mitch-denham05,A poor use of 2.5hrs...,3,5 May 2013,"A brief review of the movie 'Oblivion'I should start by saying that there will be a couple spoilers coming up, so if you really want to see Oblivion, frankly after seeing it I cannot imagine why you would, don't read any further. This is a spoiler alert.I cannot easily express in words how bored and disappointed I was with this movie. It is tediously predictable, with stereotypical (main plot) characters with no real character development to speak of.There's the 'bad ass' military guy (Tom Cruise), the 'emotionally broken/O.A.G.' lover character (Andrea Riseborough), and the 'surprise! I'm actually your wife' character who's supposed to be an important character to the overall story but you just don't care (Olga Kurylenko), and then we come to the 'Old guy who's kinda strange and is thought to be the enemy, but actually knows sh#t, and is actually a good guy' character (Morgan Freeman). We're expected to care about these characters, especially the first 3 mentioned, but you honestly don't. You especially have no reason to after it hits about the 1.5hr mark when a (read: another) predictable event happens (the ""enemy"" are actually people not aliens, and the ""good guys"" are actually the alien bad guys...).Tom Cruise played his role fairly well, but it was similar to many other roles he's had. He's really the only character you sort of care about to a small extent. Andrea Riseborough was just plain annoying, she reminded me of Overly Attached Girlfriend to be honest. Olkga Kurylenko didn't play the role very well, however her role wasn't brilliant anyway. Morgan Freeman was unsurprisingly the best in his role, and suited his character very well as the old guy who knows sh#t.There are scenes in Oblivion which I couldn't help but think ""Man, this director really is a fan of Star Wars"". There's just so many things wrong with this movie, things which should be a basic feature of any movie (except for perhaps a porno) - Character development: You won't find any of that here. Original plot ideas: You won't find these here either. Plot twists/interesting events: Again, something which doesn't exist here. The feeling of being immersed in another world: Nope.I went into this movie actually expecting something somewhat substantial, I mean this movie does have Morgan Freeman after all! Sadly, I was presented with a 2.5hr long sleeping pill. I literally held off going to the toilet just to distract myself from the boring misery on the screen, just to have something else to do.I suppose it was visually well done, and I did like the scene where Tom Cruise fights Tom Cruise, but other than that it was a complete waste of time that I'm never getting back. I hope Morgan Freeman was paid a lot of money for this role, because it's by far the worse movie I've seen him in; I'm including the 'Evan All Mighty' series of films in this too.TLDR: Oblivion is a bad movie. Don't waste your time.",Oblivion
977,tomdinan-677-604686,Unimaginative SF film with an interest in Macaulay,6,5 May 2013,"The production values are good but to me this seemed like an unimaginative version of good earthlings defeat bad alien. And for some unexplained reason Thomas Babington Macaulay's book of poetry ""Lays of Ancient Rome"" had a part in the movie. They quote a stanza from it ""Then out spake brave Horatius,The Captain of the Gate:""To every man upon this earthDeath cometh soon or late.And how can man die betterThan facing fearful odds,For the ashes of his fathers,And the temples of his gods,"" I suppose this is meant to represent Tom Cruise's character's struggle against alien oppression. I got a copy of this book from the library (1875 edition). This poem, Horatius, is pretty heavy stuff with numerous references to ancient Rome. What was the purpose of the movie makers in mentioning this poem? Do they want us to run out of the theater and go to the library to get a copy?I was also disappointed with the role that Olga Kurylenko was given in the movie. It consisted mostly of staring agape at Tom Cruise. Too bad really; what a waste. She had a much better part in ""Quantum of Solace"" , the recent Bond film.",Oblivion

He then discovers a dead clone in a rover and starts to investigate. The moon wasn't a great movie, but it also used cloning and the main character also found out he was a clone.

That is my only negative about this movie and is minor.The graphics and special effects were very good and engaging.The story line is complex enough to be interesting and isn't one of the typical, overused, and predictable Hollywood scenarios. The movie might be hard to follow if not a sci-fi and futurist fanThere are several themes and archetypes used, some are: pyramid (the Tet), compartmentalization, DNA memory, artificial intelligence, drones, and clones. Good stuff for sci-fi fans.The gist is man versus machine or biological intelligence versus artificial intelligence, and since humans made this movie, the humans win.",Oblivion

Technical effects are top notch, and the props are reminiscent of the Star Trek series in their quality and cool factor. But what blew me away mostly was the landscape photography which is really what gives this movie it's character. Watching the credits at the end one finds out it was mostly filmed in Iceland, hence the astoundingly stark moonscape type backdrops. Now I want to travel to that country ! Good acting and superb directing from Kosynski, though the script is a bit hard to follow at times. I won't go into that not to give anything away, suffice it to say you have to pay attention...

This year really hasn't been one for the critics, who, for the most part have mis-judged every film that I have seen. Perhaps the critics are becoming too critical, or too politically correct, both of which impair their ability to see a good film when one is right in front of them.Onto the film itself and it has all that one would expect of a good scifi, mystery, suspense, incredible visuals, a 'what happens next' scenario and a few loud bangs thrown in for good measure. Tom cruise plays his part amazing, especially considering the complexity of the character he plays (revealed in the movie). And any movie containing merely the voice of Morgan Freeman is always worth a watch. This film is not dumbed down, it does even attempt to make one think about life and the world, so perhaps that is why the critics disliked it (hehe). I would not say its a top 250 (imdb) but its definitely a movie that I will always recommend, and when attempting to find fault, i was unable to find enough of one to warrant any other rating than 10/10.

Unfortunately in the second hour the movie totally collapses because there is a strong parallel with the movies ""Moon"" and ""Independence day"". Actually ""Oblivion"" is more spiced up version of ""Moon"" with almost the same ending as ""Independence day"". And that's really the stupid part of the movie. An alien identity with the smartest of high tech (scanning) gear just let's good old Tom Cruise fly into the heart of the mother-ship with a bomb, where Tommy throw some heroic philosophical dialog lines in the air and of course blows up the mother-ship.

But the screenwriters had a brain slip thinking that stunning visuals (much better than average CGI), some nice music and reliable actors ""Mr.Sci"" Tom Cruise and ""Mr.Awesome"" Morgan Freeman could carry this movie. The 4 shining stars the movie get is from the above alone. The remaining 6 collapsed stars are just bad decisions...I will ignore the fact that the first 20 minutes of the film contain the teachings of a certain Hubbard; IRL I would rant about this but not here.Instead I make the case that this movie is Moon, with sprinkles of a love story and some action. I will go as far as saying that this is a blatant and plain bad Moon remake. Some guys are, unbeknownst to them, working for an adversary (insert bad corp from Moon), there are lots of them (Moon), they are promised to go to a better place (insert end of work shift from Moon). But they are a bit different, and discover the true nature of the beast (Moon), and...But why they are even there to begin with is awfully bizarre. Maintenance crew? Really? Is it that smart of the very intelligent entity to keep humans as such? I refuse to believe that it need some external beings to maintain it.Then again, it is not that intelligent. It seem to suffer from conditional strokes. The very advanced pattern recognition it exercise just vanishes sometimes. Perhaps it needed a repairman(?). My favorite part is when in a total of 15 seconds of screen time, it confess its stupidity: ""I detect that you breathe heavily, your heart rate is rising, voice analysis show you're lying, there are 2 of you, and"" *bzz* ""Oh, I could at least have installed minor means to detect radioactive material.

The movies have to be good regardless of the director or film star. I say this because the last movie that completely blew me away was Vanilla Sky and now another Tom Cruise movie has done the same. I couldn't find fault with it. At all. Its visually stunning and yet very understated, not once did I feel that the creators were showing off as is so common these days. The OST is unbelievable. M83 have managed a score that easily equals Hans Zimmer, Michael Kamen and Thomas Newman. I can't speak highly enough of the music and its part in my appreciation of the film. It is simply beautiful and used to great effect throughout. Cruise is on top form and looking very comfortable. Morgan Freeman is terrific as usual and really suits the part so well.

I think it deserves to be considered among the classics of science fiction. This is a character and story driven film more than an action adventure, although it has enough action to make it fun to watch. It's visually stunning, owing to the fact that it was shot mostly ""in camera,"" meaning that the sets and location are almost entirely real with only as much CG as needed. The actors are acting in real spaces and not in front of green screens. The musical score is unique and original and integrates very nicely with the visuals.I love that the story reveals its surprises as it goes along and isn't predictable. I love that the scenery, sets, objects and such in the film are beautiful to look at. It reminds me in many ways of Forbidden Planet, another sci-fi classic that's still fun to watch over 50 years after it was made.

The designers created everything you see in this movie to scale to make a truly realistic experience. The sky tower was designed beautifully!

May be if you are an avid science fiction expert you can fill in the yawning gaps , YEs it is basically a love story, though why you would care about either character who would know.

997,jdaedalus,Gorgeous but flawed - doesn't live up to its potential,6,13 August 2013,"This is most definitely a worthwhile use of your time if you are a fan of science fiction. The first 1/3 or maybe even 1/2 or so of the movie is utterly captivating, thematically, visually, and especially sonically, and the acting is quite compelling.(I have to make a note here about the sound design, especially in the beginning... it is really spectacular and original, blending perfectly with the original music composed by M83, as well as the visual aesthetic.) Unfortunately the film comes apart at the seams in some regards...I think it starts to lose steam about the time of the dramatic reveal, when the mystery and ambiguity of the situation goes up in smoke, and there are unfortunately no further plot twists left. (One more Shyamalan-esque turn would've earned this movie a lot of points in my book).There are also a number of pretty extraneous-feeling action/chase sequences, with a lot of extremely worn out Hollywood tropes. Morgan Freeman is utterly underused as an actor, and Olga Kurylenko's performance was unimpressive. Actually that might not be her fault, because Julia's character was rather unimpressive.This brings me to a final point: there are no really positive female characters in this movie. Julie is there only to further elaborate Jack's character, and to give him someone to save and protect, ""Sally"" is just a bitch, and Victoria, although she is wonderfully portrayed by Andrea Riseborough, is a deeply flawed character, ultimately a tool of the system, more interested in safety and security than knowing the truth (and saving our planet/species). As she says herself, ""I don't want to know."" This just strikes me as very unbalanced, if not worse (and I am a guy).I must say that I did like how they tied everything together at the end by cutting between present day and the events on the Odyssey, as Jack listened to the flight recorder.All in all, this is worth your time, definitely has its moments, but is too uneven to get my full endorsement. Points for tackling the themes of cloning, memory, identity, and AI (and bonus points for just being so gorgeous and visually/sonically convincing), but ultimately this was too Hollywood and not enough Moon (see Moon 2009, by Duncan Jones).",Oblivion

The story is so well accompanied by visual prowess it will envelope the unspoiled mind. If one could see this movie without having seen any movie ever before it would stay in your mind forever. Imagine having only read books and used your imagination to play out the stories in your mind and then see this film: it would certainly blow your unspoiled mind. The acting is also far above average. The emotions are not discussed and debated and chewed up and spit out and digested again as in Woody Allen flicks, yet are held inside most of the time and are revealed visually on the characters faces.

As an engaged viewer you don't really care about the characters very much, your relationship with them throughout the story is pretty distant.Tom Cruise is at the centre of everything in fact I don't think there is a single time where the camera is not following him, except for a few minutes toward the end.If you are looking for a great story, Oblivion is not going ""blow your socks off"" but to pass the time, it certainly suffices.",Oblivion

It was the Alien Skavs. It was Sally. But who is Sally? I also loved the character development with Jack Harper. The whole clone thing was a cool twist.

That being said, it seemed that any time that there was an opportunity to produce a scene multiple ways, it was done the wrong way. It appeared as if this was the directors first film, even though I am sure it was not.There was the swimming scene with Tom and the female lead. They were talking, rough-housing, and making commotion from one camera angle, and then it switched angles, and Tom was swimming silently by himself and nothing was going on! It appeared that the director asked for the crew to get some ""B Roll"" of Tom just treading water, and they'd just edit it in somewhere.I also hate to bash Tom Cruise, since it is assumed that it is the bias from him going crazy, but it is not. One of my favorite movies is The Last Samurai. That being said, he was pretty not believable in this movie. It looked like he was collecting a paycheck.I gave this movie a fair shake, and saw this over another movie I was sure that I'd love, and was incredibly disappointed.

There is a LOT of hydrogen and oxygen out there in the universe, and of all the things that make our beautiful planet special the isotope ratio of our water is not one of them.Additionally, the dramatic pauses really got to me.

The movie's depth is great, you will need to watch it 2-3 times to fully understand a look, a word or even a slight move in the first 3 minutes that actually gives a big hint about what is happening around.Finally, in lots of scenes but also in general, there are plenty of messages-opinions having to do with modern people's way of living.PS.

1013,matiglas,Almost perfect movie.,9,18 April 2014,"This is one of that kind of movies that are special, with a perfect plot. For those who like Sci-Fi, I think they will love this movie. Because the complicated history it has, makes the watcher not to know who are the good, and who are the bad. It may be difficult to understand first, but after watching again some parts, you should be able to understand it and worth it. The only reason I didn't like this movie is what happens with the protagonist's girlfriend. Anyway as they say ""Another day in paradise""... I love this sometime utopia... sometime dystopia movie... Also because it shows the reality which the business and richest persons make us to see. Summarizing, I recommend to watch ""Oblivion"".",Oblivion

I missed Oblivion at the multiplex because I believed a critic when they said it had nothing new to offer. But on viewing the Blu-ray version at home alone with no distractions I was able to glean that this was an excellent movie premise with good plot twists . Yes I've seen Moon and other sci-fi this movie /graphic novel adaptation borrows from but what I came away with was what its like to want to be and remain human.. and how love of another person or the earth itself can reinforce your humanity. I hope that Universal eventually recoups the $120,000,000 spent getting this to the screen( $84,000,000 gathered so far ) and the movie gets the following it deserves and remember... its no John Carter of Mars !!",Oblivion

1016,PRim69,Disappointed,6,7 February 2014,"Whether you enjoy this film depends in what you want out of watching a film. Film quality is great, acting is good. I can't remember seeing Morgan Freeman acting badly in any film I have seen. Tom Cruise Is Tom Cruise. Sometimes good, sometimes OK. Here I thought he was good. I'm afraid the actors were let down by the storyline though. Basically the writer has watched Independence Day, The Matrix and Moon and merged them together. Quite predictable. Ending was a bit corny. Seemed to be made for that part of the US audience who don't like bad things. Apologies for the sweeping statement but it was already an end of mankind type film where mankind comes through adversity with some sacrifice along the way and then to sugar coat it at the finale was pretty poor in my book.",Oblivion
1017,artturi-petaja-944-34181,Well balanced and capturing sci-fi,8,9 March 2014,"Oblivion is a film that succeeds in something that is increasingly uncommon in films, especially high-caliber, visually elaborate films. It ties up the bundle leaving no loose ends. When the movie ends it gives the viewer a sense of satisfaction; a sense that everything in the film had a purpose and the different elements were in balance. The film is visually impressive to watch and the setting of the story is capturing. There is action but not too much to undermine the atmosphere and mystery of the story. The dialogue is not excessive either and that which is there is well thought through. The characters are convincing, both in script and in the performance of the actors. The story line is one that could easily give rise to a 2-hour explanatory monologue and far from all questions that may arise in the viewer are answered. However, in this case that is not a problem. The film itself doesn't address more questions than it answers. It does not attempt to explain everything; it focuses on only a few characters and their story, no more. This is why Oblivion succeeds rather well. It does not try to take a bigger bite than what a 2-hour film can chew. The result is a well-working balance that is enjoyable to watch and satisfying afterwards. For anyone who finds the film's genre interesting, Oblivion is worth to watch as it easily ranks among the better sci-fi productions of past years.",Oblivion
1018,jacenhalstead,100% just OK,6,30 June 2014,"This movie is OK, worth a watch at least. That is if you're not someone who will be bothered by the fact that:1.) this is a mediocre rehash of every sci-fi movie that came before it. I mean, even as a tribute to the great movies you're ripping off you could introduce something new to the mix (see Cabin in The Woods for an example of worthwhile tributes). but no, not here. 2.) any romantic subplots that exist are entirely undone by a complete lack of chemistry between the characters. that's not to say the acting is bad, it isn't. there's just no emotion between these characters. 3.) well, mostly just number 1 on my list really... oh, wait!4.) there seems to be no motivation, or at least no explanation for the motivations of the alien or the robot or whatever the hell it is. further more, no explanation of what it is exactly (i have to assume that it's HAL from the future who's traveled back in time to exact his revenge). no mention of where it came from, why it needs water or why it's really stupid. A little bit of back story goes a long way, even a tease to get the imagination working (an advanced civilization created a machine that transforms water into energy and now it's gone haywire, reeking havoc across the galaxy. this is just off the top of my head here). over all this is a movie for people who've never seen movies and don't require much of them. but if you've got some time to kill or just wanna space out to some big budget scifi it's worth the 2 hours.",Oblivion
1019,aajgood,"A moody, thought provoking movie",9,10 July 2014,"I'm not surprised by the mediocre scores - it is a movie that wants to engage with people at a more intellectual level. It doesn't spoon feed the audience an infantile plot - you are going to need to think a little about this one. Great movie and very thought provoking.The CGI and action sequences in this movie are very good, but it's not what this movie is about and the lack of constant action is not going to entertain some. As this movie does not move at 100 mph and has some complex ideas and a darker moodiness to it, it will not appeal to everyone. However, if you like a movie that provokes thought, that leaves some deeper philosophical questions and ties it together with high production values, you will love this one.As I watched this movie, I queried some of the plot choices and see many of the same questions I asked myself here on this site. As the movie progressed though, these queries were answered. There are no inconsistencies and everything fits into a tight package. A lot of it does not becomes clear until we hear the flight recording toward the end. For me it was an 'oh yeh' type moment that helps fit things in place, such as why Jack was with Victoria.Quite a few spoilers coming up.I read some comments that criticised the ending - someone called it facile resolution. I think this is wrong. The resolution wasn't about having to go in guns blazing at the end, the resolution came from beating the system. Having to fight his way to the Tet or overcome physical barriers put up by the Tet would belittle the battle to discover who he was and why he was there.Why did it take the scavs 60 years to bring down the spacecraft? It could have been five years or it could have been 500 years. Presumably they had not captured a drone until this point and didn't need the fuel cells from the spacecraft until then. Capturing the drone motivated this action. It took time to capture the drone because time was needed to progress to a point where spare parts were in short supply and the drones could not be reliably repaired. Why weren't there enough spare parts? I think this was a plug for the human capacity to resist and employ guerrilla tactics - something an alien being may not have expected.What a remarkable coincidence that jack's wife was on the spacecraft. No it wasn't. Jack and his wife were both on the spacecraft originally. Jack and Victoria were the only humans to come into contact with the Tet as they were in the lunar module - the reason they were cloned and manned the towers on earth - the remainder of the spacecraft was left to orbit earth. It was clear that the Tet didn't really understand humans and human relationships. It explained why Jack and Victoria had such an unusual relationship and were not entirely compatible - which was really well portrayed and added good tension in the earlier part of the movie.What did the aliens need all the power for? It is not explained and not relevant to progressing the story.For me the movie raised a lot of other questions about clones. If I am a clone with the same memories as the original, am I for all intents and purposes the original. Is Jack 52 just as much the father to Julia's daughter as Jack 49?",Oblivion
1020,chafir-1,"Decent premise, middling execution, horrible waste of a character.",6,3 January 2014,"I would not recommend spending money on this movie. The basic plot line is sound and the core idea is excellent, but as other reviews note they screw it up by surrounding it with tropes and clichés all over the place. Up until the ""reveal"", I was engaged. After that, not so much. The biggest issue I actually had with it was that after discovering and rescuing Julia, I was initially stoked for her character as being someone with some presence and command. In short, she seemed badass (selected for a secret space mission, sharp enough to stop herself being sedated moments after regaining consciousness, clear objective to retrieve the recorder). For a moment it looked like the character depth of the movie was stepping up and the whole thing would be more interesting.But... if I remember right, after they retrieve the recorder, her only lines were basically ""Jack!"", ""Jack...?"" and ""Jack -"". As soon as she's played the part of supplying the recorder she turns into this foil for the main character to obsess over his past (while she looks on silently), gets shot just so that Jack needs to go to a certain place, and strips down to a tank top on a cold- looking windy landscape for no apparent reason. Since Jack apparently did not feel sweaty enough to even roll up his sleeves, it's hard to not feel like this was simply to provide a bit of sex appeal for the emotional scene at the binoculars, and lying prone in the cave. Lame handling of a really promising character and perfectly represents the film's total two- dimensionality.",Oblivion
1021,lealaphyeris,My opinion (may contain spoilers),7,14 August 2014,"I wanted to watched this film long ago, and on Tuesday I did.Well, I'm not so impressed. When I saw the trailer, I thought this would be a great film - I love this kind of Sci-fi ones.The graphics is great, and the romantic line is cute. the actors also did a great job. However, there are many glitches and illogical events in the story.Like: when Jack enters the 'radiation zone' with his ship, the ship switches off and he cannot start it up again. However, when he steals the ship from the other Jack, he can enter the radiation zone without the ship switching off.Also, the story is a bit slow at the beginning, and in the end it's too fast. The very end is - in my opinion - awful. I'm on the opinion that it could have been much better. For watching it once it's good, but I don't think I'll watch it again.",Oblivion

For a movie like this that has a lot to give and explain I think 2 hours is a good run time, at no point did the movie feel long winded. I am not a massive Cruise fan but he plays this role very well. Others have pointed out some flaws and no doubt like everything it isn't perfect but if you are looking for some interesting, thought provoking and moving sci-fi then give Oblivion a watch.p.s World class soundtrack!",Oblivion
1023,turbodude55,Brain Damaged Plot,3,7 October 2014,"If you aren't able to give this movie 1000+% of your attention while it is running, then don't even try to watch it. Even then, you will more than likely have a bad migraine at the end anyway. Unlike great sci-fi time travel/third dimension shows like the Back To The Future series that enable the viewer to follow some level of plot complexity well, this film forces the viewer to analyze and re-analyze every event ad-nauseum with the only result being severe progressive confusion.When it attempts to ""pull it all together"" 10 minutes before the film's end, the many pieces of confused sub-plots and key events cannot be either: 1) Logically reconciled to better explain the overall plot up until that point, or 2) Explain clearly how or why Jack (Tom Cruise) ended up with Morgan Freeman instead of Julia in the alien mother ship, and how the bomb ended up with them when it was obvious that Kara could read Jack's vital signs and more, but not detect the presence of a large nuke? Of course, every sci-fi show has to have clones in it, doesn't it? What's worse is that even on my 50"" plasma screen it was hard to tell (and I'm still not absolutely sure) that they were all clones of Jack and Victoria mounted in the wall of the ship. Other reviewers seem to be not remarking about the very end when Jack ends up back at his mountain shack and all live happily ever after with kids and all.Bottom line is too late in coming, and too much left to the imagination of the already severely confused victim of this movie. A movie that makes any viewer with more than a room temperature IQ work this hard to be entertained isn't worth the time or the effort, even if it DID make sense at the end. Thank God this was on my cable premium channel so that I did not have to pay for it in a theater or as an On-Demand.I actually felt bad that Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman put their names on this psychotic venture. I am a fan of Cruise for great performances in flicks like Born On The Fourth Of July, Rain Main, and A Few Good Men. Morgan Freeman deserves everyone's respect for all his great dramatic roles. So I guess he was fooled into showing up because they told him his character Beech had a ""God-like"" persona. Besides, George Burns could not return from the third dimension to play the part. Burns must should been the Director Joseph Kosinski's first choice, as they both live in some other dimension, or should I say reality or realm of sanity as in Joseph Kosinski's case.I rated it (generously) at 3 stars only for some exciting and well executed visual effects.

1025,nathan-tavares,Great movie with great visuals,9,16 December 2014,"Oblivion takes place on a futuristic version of earth in the year 2077. A war has broken out between two sides: Humans and Alien Scavs. The humans won the war, but it cost them the earth. They used nukes, which solved the problem temporarily but has forever ruined the earth's surface. The remaining inhabitants that survived the war are living on one of Jupiter's moons. Orbiting above the earth there is a space station called the Tet. Inside of the Tet is Sally (Melissa Leo). She gives orders to Jack (Tom Cruise) and Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who are the last 2 survivors on Earth. Jack is a drone repairman. His job each day is to fix the drones that Julia assigns him (Alien Scavs like to shoot down the drones and steal the cores of them for their use). With only 2 weeks remaining and vivid flashbacks of his past, can he make it off the earth to be reestablished with the human population?This movie has quite a bit of action and plot twists; in fact you will probably be at the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. The special effects for the scenes in space are through the roof, amazing. For someone like me, who appreciates the reality of space, they did a great of portraying it. Especially when they were describing how the Alien Scavs had blown up the moon. The camera slowly pans up in the night sky and you can see the moon with blown up bits around it. A music group known as M83 made the soundtrack. Many people know this group for their song titled, ""Midnight City"". I really think music can make or break how much a scene matters and they did a great job with the movie score. It stars Tom Cruise, but also has Morgan Freeman in it and he is great in this movie. I can't say too much about Morgan Freeman except that I wish he would have had more of a role in the movie, but he is present in the movie for a little. The costumes actually play a big role in the movie. They are designed really well and are used in the movie for more than looks. For example, the Alien Scavs use fighter jet helmets not only to hide their faces, but because they have radio's built into them for communication and it masks their voice from being comprehensible. They use these throughout the whole movie and many other props. The movie is around the 2-hour mark, so it's slightly longer than an average movie but they do not waste time, something is always going on. Instead of being like a movie that could really be less than an hour but they end up dragging it one for an hour and a half. Overall I think that this would be a good movie for anyone who likes Action/Sci-Fi genre movies. The movie is visually stunning and the plot is brilliant. This movie will definitely leave you wondering whether something like this could ever happen in real life.",Oblivion
1026,ecpeters13,Nothing monumental. Really enjoyed it nonetheless :),7,11 January 2015,"In a world where the post-apocalyptic/alien invasion setting has been done a thousand times over, it's certainly difficult to find something that sets itself aside from the others. Oblivion is one such film. Though some have complained about the clichés and plot holes, I personally believe that it easily makes up for these things with its originality in concept and overall likability. I have tried to find another movie to compare it to. I just can't. No other film of this kind has left me so intrigued and then satisfied at the films conclusion. And when I say intriguing, I mean really intriguing. Even the bad marketing that Oblivion had prior to its release didn't ruin this. Now I may be praising this film but I do acknowledge the issues that others have brought up. It's far from a perfect film. Oblivion just appealed to me in a special way... Its a delightful treat of originality with some clichés sprinkled here and there. If you can learn to look past it's issues and enjoy oblivion for its original concepts, intriguing plot, likable characters, on screen romance, and highly satisfying ending, this film delivers.",Oblivion

The only thing I didn't quiet understand was how easily Julia could fall in love (or stay in love) with someone she knew was a clone of her husband, rather than her actual original husband. That part was a bit weird. I also don't think that a clone would have resurfacing memories of the person they were cloned from. That was a bit far fetched as well.One of my favorite things about this movie was the small space ship that Tom Cruise pilots. Damn that was an awesome space craft! You could see in the movie how the brilliance of the technology and design in the space craft (as well as the ""drones"") would make them extremely ""effective"".",Oblivion
1028,samskala,Crap,2,7 May 2013,"Two only for Morgan Freeman and some decent camera work. 8 points off for being so bad it literally made me angry. I have not seen Moon and I will try not spoil anything signifcant for you, but if you have seen one scifi movie, don't waste one second of your life with this. I was so excited going into the theater, I thought the premise looked great. I like post apocalyptic films and have no problem with Tom Cruise. First point, the pacing is terrible. There are moments that drag on endlessly, then things perk up a bit, back to dragging. If the characters were more engaging the slow spots might not have been too bad, but they are not. Tom is the best of the lot. No one else really has anything to do or contributes much on screen. The Vica character was as useful as the computer on Star Trek, but less charming, to call the rest caricatures would be kind, mainly they are just fodder for the drones. Plot holes, OMG. I lost count at how many, but here's a few that really burned, the drones can either not be shot down with about a million bullets fired at them, or just one bullet will take care of them, Come on! Two, spoiler - given that Vica has Jack (Tom) on a very short leash when did he have time to make his cabin in the woods? Three, spoilerish when the ship is ejected and sent back to earth, where did it go b/c it never landed on earth? Was it just in orbit? How did the folks here know it was there and how to get it down? Did NASAs records survive the annihilation? Also, and then I will close, the story is repetitious, painfully repetitious. I don't mean just that it rips off so many better films, I mean the movie shows the same scene many,many,many,many times. Like spoiler Jacks ""memories"" or whatever of old Earth. You see the thoughts many times, then he meets up with a female and has the thoughts again, then he talks about the thoughts and then you see the scene again, for like the 5th time.

Perhaps the best film score I've heard for several years. The cinematography is quite something, not many sci-fi films manage to look quite so real. Some say it loses momentum during the second half but I actually felt the second half was just as strong.
