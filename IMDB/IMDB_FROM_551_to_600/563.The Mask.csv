0,MartinHafer,Not for children...but very enjoyable.,8,26 October 2018,"I have a friend in Italy that has been pestering me to watch ""The Mask"". Angelo thinks it's one of the best movies...ever! Well, while I don't match his level of enthusiasm, I did really enjoy the movie and think it's well worth your time...unless you are a kid. While the movie looks like a kids' film, there are too many adult jokes and kicks to the groin to make it a good movie for younger folks.Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a nice guy but also a total wimp who lets people walk all over him. Upon discovering a strange Norse mask and uncovers who you really are down deep, he becomes a Tex Avery-style cartoon character in the real world. Now, Stanley is part lover, part trickster...and he runs afoul of a gang intent on doing bad stuff. Can Stanley manage to stop the gang, save the girl AND stay out of jail??This film is enjoyable on a turn off your brain and enjoy level. It's filled with CGI, homages to various cartoons (such as ""Swingshift Cinderella"") and is worth your time. And, in this case, Carrey was the perfect actor for the role due to his energy and athleticism.",The Mask
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Hugely enjoyable comedy, and by far one of Carrey's better films",10,14 April 2010,"I truly enjoy this film. It isn't the best movie ever or anything like that but it is still a hugely enjoyable comedy in my opinion. And I also think that along with Liar Liar and The Truman Show that The Mask is one of Jim Carrey's better movies. Here Carrey's role is split, his mild mannered banker and a wild, crazy superhero. Either way, he excels in this film, he is completely in his element and completely unpredictable. He is helped by the special effects, which are utterly amazing, a truly imaginative and sophisticated visual style that worked so well here. Here because of the special effects, Carrey moves around at whirlwind speed, pops his eyeballs and swaps parts of his anatomy for his cartoon equivalents and you know what it is jolly funny. There are so many good scenes though my favourite was the Bugs Bunny-style Cuban Pete routine. Also superb are the script, which is as funny and as imaginative as the film itself and the suitably tongue in cheek music score. Not to mention the adorable pet dog, underrated Peter Reigert, Peter Greene's Dorian and gorgeous Cameron Diaz. Overall, hugely enjoyable, funny and imaginative, so much better than its sequel Son of the Mask which I disliked so much I try to forget it exists. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Mask
2,Leofwine_draca,Too silly,4,19 September 2021,"My first exposure to Jim Carrey, age 13. Not a fan. I don't mind slapstick humour but this was too much, too silly. The only things that made an impression were the cool CGI effects and Cameron Diaz, who never looked this fine again.",The Mask
3,SnoopyStyle,Perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey,8,25 December 2013,"A mask with magical powers is released from an underwater chest in Edge City. Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a super nice meek bank clerk. This is the first movie with Cameron Diaz. She plays a hot bombshell who walks into the branch to open an account. It turns out that she's actually casing the bank. Then he finds the mask, and things take a turn for the crazy.This is the perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. He is basically a Bugs Bunny cartoon with the mask on. And that's his persona on stage. This premise allows Carrey to use his manic energy to the fullest without looking ridiculous. And it doesn't hurt to have a hot Cameron Diaz walking around in those tight short dresses.",The Mask
4,kosmasp,Hello Ms. Diaz,9,4 June 2021,"Cameron Diaz ... what an introduction to the film world. While I reckon some may feel that her walking into this or how she is portrayed, is borderline sexist, you would be taking the fun out of the movie even before you started watching it. One thing is for sure: Jim Carrey is having as much fun as anyone can have. You can tell and it really comes through his performance and through the screen to anyone watching.There is a movie logic - so whatever happens here .. just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow! Good guys finish last ... unless they find something that changes their life(s). Rewatching this made me realize how good it is .. good actors involved too, but it is the Jim Carrey show no doubt about that. I do wonder why the sequel is rated so low ... the idea seems so foolproof that ... but I haven't seen that yet ... I just might watch it one day ... I think I have seen worse ... anyway, back to this! This is amazing, so there you go!",The Mask
5,lee_eisenberg,"""The Mask"" is, and forever will be, SMOKIN'!",10,19 September 2005,"""The Mask"" was the movie that introduced my family to Jim Carrey. And we all thought that it was great. Carrey plays unlucky bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, who one night finds an ancient mask. When he puts it on, he turns into sort of a cartoon character; think Roger Rabbit on acid. The really great thing about the movie is that they just turn Carrey loose. Anything that you can imagine him doing, he does here. A particularly funny scene is when the police tell him to freeze, you'd better believe that he freezes! All in all, Jim Carrey's humor will never get old. He may have given his all-time funniest performance in ""The Mask"".",The Mask
6,jboothmillard,The Mask,10,16 March 2005,"When I was younger this used to be a fantastic family comedy film, and it still is. Basically Stanley Ipkiss (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey is the mild-mannered bank clerk working with best friend Charlie (Richard Jeni), and one day he meets and is instantly attracted to the beautiful Tina Carlyle (introducing Cameron Diaz). They see each other again (after he has been soaked) at the Coco Bongo Club, and it is on his way home that he discovers an ancient green wooden mask inhabited by the spirit of mischievous god, Loki. When he puts this mask on, he is transformed into a green faced uncontrollable wacky cartoony alter-ego superhero. When Tina eventually meets ""The Mask"", she is instantly attracted to him and has no idea it is Stanley. Meanwhile, Stanley has to deal with Lt. Mitch Kellaway (Peter Riegert) who has reason to believe Stanley is this ""Mask"". Eventually, Stanley has bigger problems when Tina's villainous gangster boyfriend Dorian Tyrell (Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene) gets hold of the mask, and plans to take over Edge City with his new found power. The concluding scenes in the Coco Bongo Club, fighting for the mask, including dog Milo putting it on, are fantastically funny. Also starring Amy Yasbeck as Peggy Brandt, Orestes Matacena as Niko, Nancy Fish as Mrs. Peenman, Jim Doughan as Detective Doyle, Denis Forest as Sweet Eddy and Ben Stein as Dr. Arthur Neuman. The cartoonish special effects are amazing, Carrey is hilarious as The Mask, Diaz's debut is great, this is just a must-see family film. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects. Cameron Diaz was number 65, and Jim Carrey number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Diaz was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and the film was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Diaz's great introductory entrance. Outstanding!",The Mask
7,BA_Harrison,"You'll love it when Carrey does the chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom!",10,20 October 2007,"Not only does Chuck Russell's The Mask deliver one of Jim Carrey's best performances, a shed-load of brilliant anarchic humour, special effects that still look fresh today, and some excellent musical numbers, but it is also the film that introduced movie audiences worldwide to the charms of the delectable Cameron Diaz. In short, The Mask is SMOKIN'!Carrey plays mild mannered nice guy Stanley Ipkiss, who happens upon a strange mask that, when worn, enables the wearer to become a suave, indestructible heroalbeit a very mischievous one. Unfortunately, it also helps to get Stanley into a whole heap of trouble, after his wise-cracking alter-ego upsets local gangster Dorian Tyrell, first by ruining one of his heists, and then by making out with his gorgeous girlfriend Tina (Cameron Diaz).Director Russell expertly handles the non-stop madcap action, which is heavily influenced by the manic cartoons of Tex Avery and Looney Tunes (both are referenced in the film), and funny man Carrey gives his career the boost it so badly needed with an unforgettable turn that perfectly showcased his manic style, bringing him to the attention of Hollywood's big hitters.Packed full of eye-popping make-up and visual effects, and an even more eye-popping debut from Diaz (who sets the screen alight from the moment she saunters out of the rain, sexily clad in a figure hugging red dress), The Mask is 97 minutes of pure unadulterated fun for lovers of outrageous, zany, slapstick humour.",The Mask
8,moonspinner55,A lot of fun...but exhausting,5,23 February 2008,"Nerdy bank clerk Jim Carrey (playing Stanley Ipkiss, perhaps in a nod to ""The Ipcress File"") runs afoul of gangsters; luckily, he has recently acquired an ancient mask which, when worn, turns him into a whirling dervish of a super-hero. Live-action cartoon is best left to younger audiences, with unsubtle humor, formulaic plotting, and in-your-face mugging from Carrey, who busts many moves for the length of the picture. Carrey is actually fairly agreeable here, particularly as clerk Stanley, and he's paired wonderfully with saucy Cameron Diaz, making her debut as a torchy gangster's girl. The special effects are initially quite colorful, but they wear out their welcome, as does this exceptionally slim plot. Followed by a Carrey/Diaz-less sequel and an animated TV series. ** from ****",The Mask
9,dbdumonteil,"When I wear this mask, I can be whatever I want...",7,22 April 2003,"A quite important number of movies paid a tribute to Tex Avery's cartoons like ""who framed Roger Rabbit?"". ""The Mask"" ranks among them and is a great success, although this movie takes back some characteristics suitable to American movies and particularly this one: the transition for a character from a low level to the degree of hero. Here, the main protagonist (Jim Carrey) is introduced as a clumsy person in the beginning. But the discovery of a weird mask will turn his life upside down and make him become the hero of ""Edge City"". This mask will also allow him to conquer Cameron Diaz's heart and to triumph over a gang who wished to take the city under control.As a consequence, the movie uses a globally thin and convenient screenplay but fortunately, it's compensated by the funny moments where ""the Mask"" tops the bill and this is the occasion to intervene a fanciful, but efficient humor that finds again the devastating tone of the cartoons from the forties and the fifties. It also doesn't hesitate in parodying the gangster movies from the thirties and even ""gone with the wind"".Jim Carrey's performance remains one of his best to date. He's well directed and never hams it up unlike the silly ""Ace Ventura in Africa"". Let's add an amusing description of the Kellaway cop (Peter Riegert).A movie eventually entertaining enough to sustain the interest in spite of its weaknesses.",The Mask
10,sunwarrior13,A Perfect Vehicle For Jim Carrey,9,16 October 2012,"The Mask is a fantasy comedy that is based on a series of comic books published by Dark Horse Comics. The film stars Jim Carrey as Stanley Ipkiss, a man who finds the Mask of Loki that turns him into The Mask, a trickster uninhibited by anything, including physical reality. The supporting cast includes Peter Greene as mafia officer Dorian Tyrell, Amy Yasbeck as a newspaper reporter, Peter Riegert and Jim Doughan as two police detectives, Richard Jeni as Stanley's friend, Orestes Matacena as nightclub owner and mafia boss Niko, Ben Stein as a psychologist, and Cameron Diaz in her feature film debut as Stanley's love interest Tina Carlyle.Hyperactive mayhem results when a mild-manned banker discovers an ancient mask that transforms him into a zany prankster with superhuman powers in this special-effects-intensive comedy.Stanley Ipkiss is a decent-hearted but socially awkward guy who one night finds a strange mask. Stanley puts on the mask and the banker transforms into The Mask, a green-skinned, zoot-suited fireball. The rubber-faced Mask possesses the courage to do the wild, fun things that Stanley fears, including romancing Tina Carlyle. The larger narrative, involving the efforts of Tina's gangster boyfriend to destroy Stanley and use the mask's powers for evil, prove less interesting than the anarchic comic set pieces.The film delivered enough laughs as it is a perfect vehicle for the talents of Jim Carrey wherein he seems to have found a story and character that work together with manic energy.In addition to his physical talents, the film makes effective use of digital visual effects that bestow the Mask with superhuman speed, insane flexibility, and popping eyes out of a Tex Avery cartoon.The design is bright as a button and the transformation scenes real eye-poppers, but the film's best special effect is putty-faced Carrey with his razzle-dazzle star turn as the affable Stanley and his manic alter ego.This makes it a marvelously energetic and highly enjoyable.",The Mask

12,LeonLouisRicci,Tex Avery Lives,10,23 December 2013,"One of the Best Movies of the 1990's. This is a Charming Homage to Animator Tex Avery and a Perfect Role for Jim Carrey. Oh yea, Cameron Diaz in Her Debut is Drop Dead Gorgeous. There is not much to not like in this Wonderfully Rendered, virtual Remake of Animator Avery's Gags. He was a Legendary Groundbreaker in the World of Cartoons and is a Name often Linked to the likes of Walt Disney and Max Fleischer.But this Film stands alone because it is so well Crafted that it cannot be Overlooked in its near Perfectness. Everything comes together here as a Work of Art. There is the use of State of the Art SFX (1994), a Bravura Performance from Carrey, a Stunning and Full Musical Performance from Diaz, and a Brilliant Amalgamation of Cartoon and Live Action. The Dog is also in on the Fun and is as Good as Everyone Else.This is a somewhat Underrated Movie that holds up Fine, and is a Timeless Piece that will Entertain Audiences for Years to come. Just like those Old Cartoons. A Must See.",The Mask
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The Strange Case of Thespian Jim and Comedian Carrey,7,21 November 2009,"It's interesting that the film that does so well at solving the core problem of JC's style is his first big, starring role. He is hilarious when nothing stops him; it's really that simple. However, his schtick works best for sketch stuff, where the laughs are all straightforward and throw-away. For a feature, it really works best if you care about the characters, if they're credible and relatable. They are here. The risk at using extreme stuff for material is that, at the end of the day, we can't recognize it. We can't get completely into it. Here, the goofy antics are entirely linked to the alter ego that he also plays, explained as the catharsis for a repressed ""nice guy"". His facial expressions(clear through the well-done make-up) and voices and all are put to excellent use. The humor in this tends to be over the top, silly and wacky, and if you're up for it and enjoy such, you're likely to love that aspect of this. It's got inspiration from the classic Tex Avery cartoons, and a wide array of pop culture references. There is cleverness and parody as well. Ben Stein and his bone-dry wit are marvelous here. The plot is good, and in spite of being relatively typical stuff, it does surprise the audience. All parts are well-cast, and Diaz shines; it's no wonder this gave her a career. Pacing's great, this is never boring. The effects are perhaps dated today, but they show a real energy and enthusiasm, they all get the job done, and you can tell that these guys wanted to put something specific up on the screen, and would not stop trying 'till they did so, and that is always wonderful to see in a business we associate with jaded, cynical attitudes. The tone and look are spot-on, for walking a difficult balance between grotesque and cute. Editing and cinematography are well-done. The odd thing with this is that, for all the stuff that's written almost with them in mind, this isn't all child-friendly. While it is somewhat restrained, the violence and occasional disturbing content isn't necessarily something all parents will be OK with their kid seeing. In fact, I believe there are a bunch of people who did find watching this to be too intense when they were young. Nonetheless, if you think you'll be fine, and you like imagination-packed thrill-rides, then jump on. You won't want it to end. The DVD contains two entertaining and informational commentary tracks(the older of them has a little moderate to strong language), four documentaries that I will review individually since they have their own pages here on the site, two deleted scenes with the option of hearing the director go into why they were taken out, and what his intentions were with them, and finally, a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any and all fans of Carrey, the style of jokes and gags, and the genres of fantasy and/or romance. 7/10",The Mask
14,neil-476,Sometimes everything just works,9,31 May 2010,"The comic from which this movie is derived is quite a dark piece of work. Happily, the movie adaptation chose to concentrate on the humorous and surrealistic elements which were always there. Even more happily, the movie coincided with an upsurge in Jim Carrey's career generated by his performance in Ace Ventura, and provided the perfect vehicle for his brand of face-pulling physical humour.The story is serviceable, but is essentially no more than a vehicle for the wonderfully imaginative visual sequences.This was one of the earliest movies in which sophisticated CGI provided truly eye catching sterling support to a storyline, and it is a joy to see Tex Avery-inspired cartoon goings on translated into photorealistic ""real life"" visuals. There are some terrific musical sequences too, and the movie is also very funny.Oh, and it was Cameron Diaz' first movie. There are few stars whose first appearances on screen I recall (Ursula Andress, and then I'm searching) - Diaz in The Mask is another.",The Mask
15,evanston_dad,One of Jim Carrey's Better Comedies,7,17 March 2009,"Combining Jim Carrey with a bunch of giddy special effects seems like a redundancy, since Carrey himself IS a special effect. But that's just what this film does, with mostly entertaining results.Carrey plays a nerd who finds a mask that transforms him into a superhero when he wears it. Cue lots of intentionally cartoonish effects reminiscent of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" The film features an early role for Cameron Diaz as a love interest for Carrey.The film was Academy Award nominated for its visual effects, but it lost the award to the much subtler and more impressive effects of ""Forrest Gump.""Grade: B",The Mask
16,anaconda-40658,A Lively Cartoon.,6,19 August 2015,"The Mask (1994): Dir: Chuck Russell / Cast: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, Amy Yasbeck: Spellbinding visual extravaganza that addresses our inner person. Jim Carrey plays a bank clerk whose boss is difficult, his landlord is critical, and the woman he got concert tickets for turns him down. After his car breaks down on a bridge in the rain, he sights what he believes is a person in the water but upon diving in he retrieves only a wooden mask. Putting it on spins him about in mass energy becoming a human cartoon. He drools over a beautiful dancer at a nightclub leading to an outrageous dance number. Exquisite visual feast with Carrey's face shifting into various shapes. Terrific concept grows repetitious until it hits a grand slam finale. Director Chuck Russell references old cartoons and film noir. One major issue is that it is not given why the mask is in the water or how it got here. Other than that, Carrey embodies the role right down to the final showdown. Cameron Diaz is fetching as a dancer whose introduction is mysterious until she becomes a damsel. Peter Riegert is cardboard as an idiot police inspector. Peter Greene as the villain is also flat and conventional. Amy Yasbeck plays a double crossing bimbo who befriends Ipkiss and then sells him out to the villains. Its genre analysis is inventive and in a class of its own. Score: 6 / 10",The Mask
17,FlashCallahan,A power tie....,6,1 March 2014,"Stanley Ipkiss is a shy man who working in a bank.He discovers a mask by the sea, which pictures the Norse god of tricks and deception, Loki.When Stanley puts on the mask, he transforms into an uncontrolled reflection of himself, that does crazy and sometimes, criminal things.This new super Stanley falls in love with a singer, Tina Carlyle while he decides to eliminate every gangster in the city......Between Apr 1994, and Dec 1995, here in the UK, Carrey was shoved down out throats until we got burned out.Both Ace Venturas, Dumb And Dumber, Batman Forever, and this were released, and they were huge hits.Looking back though, only one of those really holds up, and this isn't it.It's not as dark as it should have been, the comics were very dark, Ala Tank Girl, this is aimed at kiddies, and teens, and twenty years later, by Zeus does it show.Carrey is still good as Ipkiss, but after a few turns as the titular character, he really starts to grate, and the catchphrases are nowhere near as funny as they were when I was sixteen.Saying that though, it's pretty original for a comic book movie, Diaz is superb as the object of everyones affection, but it just doesn't hold up today.",The Mask
18,Wuchakk,Top-of-the-line comedy/drama/fantasy/thriller with Jim Carrey based on the Dark Horse comic book,9,6 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Chuck Russell based on Mike Richardson's comic, ""The Mask"" stars Jim Carrey as a bank clerk who is an extraordinarily nice guy, but too much of a pushover when it comes to confrontations. He inadvertently finds a mask of Loki, the Norse night god of mischief and, when he puts it on, he becomes his true self, the person he is WITHIN: a cartoony romantic wild man. Peter Greene plays the head antagonist while Peter Riegert plays the police lieutenant who investigates the havoc in the wake of The Mask.Jim Carrey's breakout year was 1994 when his three hugely popular movies hit the theaters: ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" this one, and ""Dumb and Dumber."" The following year he appeared in ""Batman Forever"" and the sequel to ""Ace Ventura."" ""The Mask"" easily ranks with his best films. When I first saw this flick in the late 90s I didn't know anything about the Dark Horse comic, so when Carrey's character first puts the mask on I didn't know what to expect and so was thoroughly taken aback by the kinetic flurry of thrills and laughs.Cameron Diaz appears on the babe front and the film really highlights her winsome appeal and ravishing figure, not that I was ever enraptured by her (then again, I don't NOT like her either). The song & dance routine featuring The Mask & Tina (Diaz) at the Coco Bongo nightclub is knock-it-out-of-the-ballpark entertainment. Remember those great song & dance routines in Coppola's ""The Cotton Club"" (1984)? Parts of ""The Mask"" are like that, but with a silly, comedic and over-the-top dynamism. The stunning Amy Yasbeck also has a significant secondary role (be sure to watch the deleted scenes to discover what happens to her character; it's hilarious in a black humor way and should've never been cut from the movie).THE FILM RUNS 101 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & San Pedro Bay, California.

21,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of my favorites in my DVD collection,9,23 November 2003,"Remember back in the day with the hit TV show In Living Color had several stars, one of them being Jim Carrey. He was one goofy guy with crazy physical comedy routines that could get your stomach hurting from laughing so much. But could this man make it to the top and possibly bring in a number one movie at the box office? He did, with 1994's smash hit The Mask. I remember seeing this movie when I was 9 years old and being in the theater nearly dying of laughter. I wanted this movie so badly on VHS when it was released, my parents got it for me and I think I must have played it a few dozen times a day. Jim Carrey was like no comedian that I had seen with how crazy this guy would be and The Mask truly showcased his talents.Stanley Ipkiss, a clerk at an Edge City bank, is a shy, luckless romantic who is regularly bullied by nearly everyone around him, including his boss, his landlady, and car mechanics. His only friends are his dog Milo and his co-worker Charlie Schumacher. Stanley is smitten with Tina, a beautiful young woman who his new client at his bank. Later that night Charlie and Stanley go to a club, but after being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, Stanley is stranded with a broken-down rental car at the city's filthy harbor, where he finds a mysterious wooden mask. When he takes the object home and puts it on, it comes alive, wraps around his head, and transforms him into a wackily-suited, green-headed, cartoonish figure called ""The Mask"", a trickster unbound by any limitations whether be personal inhibitions or physical laws, who cheerfully exacts revenge on some of Stanley's tormentors and terrifies a street gang that attempts to terrorize him.I still watch The Mask to this day, it's one of my personal favorites in my DVD collection. Jim Carrey is still a blast to watch, how could you not laugh during his Cuban Pete performance and getting all the cops that are trying to arrest him into a salsa dance? Cameron Diaz's first ever movie, God I wanted to look like her so badly when I was a kid, she was so beyond gorgeous and absolutely adorable in The Mask. Even Peter Greene made one heck of a creepy villain as Dorian and seeing him transform the mask into something like a monster was just scary. Then seeing Jim Carrey's dog transform into the mask was classic slapstick three stooge like humor that would get anyone laughing hard. The Mask is a classic that I will always enjoy and recommend if you need a good laugh, great Jim Carrey movie, still one of my favorites.9/10",The Mask
22,MovieAddict2016,S-s-s-s-mokin'!,7,23 December 2002,"Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a ""zero"" as the film tagline says, who never speaks his mind about anything. The typical mild-mannered guy. After Stanley finds an enchanted mask under a bridge one day, though, everything changes. He goes from ""zero to hero"". But first, he plays around with his new found menacing powers. Calling the mask a hero is like calling Hitler kind of a good guy. The mask makes Stanley rob banks, scare people and more. He's half-hero. ""The Mask"" is not great, but it fits Carrey's film persona quite well. He bounces off the wall (literally) and just doesn't sit still. Typical Carrey. If you're not one for loser-to-hero films or wacky slapstick, don't see ""The Mask"". Otherwise, it's worth a peek.3/5 stars",The Mask
23,sddavis63,Jim Carrey And Not Much Else,5,15 July 2001,"Jim Carrey is - as always - excellent in this movie that features little else to commend itself to viewers. Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a shy and awkward bank employee whose life is changed when he finds and dons a mysterious mask that brings out all of his innermost feelings and desires. In short, he becomes everything he wishes he was - and finds that he's better off as who he is. Perhaps a good lesson in life for all those who wish their lives were different. But this movie didn't go for any serious message. It went for laughs, and in doing so featured - at best - sophomoric humour (which is sometimes hilarious and sometimes painfully bad.) Combined with lacklustre performances from the rest of the cast, what emerged was a mediocre film which broadly resembles a big cartoon. I watched this movie with my 8 year old niece. She thought it was great. That should tell you something right there. This is definitely a movie for the younger set. If you don't have an 8 year old to watch it with, I frankly wouldn't bother.",The Mask
24,thesar-2,"Smokin', Everyone Was",9,13 April 2013,"Quick! (Just like the Mask) Let me tell you my story.Honestly, I don't remember if I saw this in theatres. I probably did, because what I do remember in early 1996, is buying the VHS copy of this movie and I watched it a grand total of 5-6 times in under a week. I recall watching The Mask over and over and never getting sick of it. Sure, I had plenty of other movies to watch, but this onewas so much fun.And it still is today. Recently, I bought this movie on BluRay, because I remember loving it, but haven't seen it in over 10 years. I seriously had just as much fun today as I did with those multiple viewings when I first bought the VHS. This movie really holds up from the many years since its release. It really is timeless.Goody-Man Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is transformed into the daredevil Mask figure when he finds, and dons an ancient wooden mask, and his inner desires come out tenfold. He goes for the girl, inadvertently pisses off the mob and takes care of business as ""The Mask"" superhero/cartoon character that mild-mannered Stanley couldn't.The story isn't exactly new, even for 1994, but it's take on the age-old underdog/superhero is fresh, exciting and most of all HILARIOUS.As a matter of fact, when prepping and watching the movie to write this review, I was puzzled on which genre this movie fit in: Action/Adventure + SuperHero? Or Comedy + the rest mentioned? And as I found myself laughing and laughing, even after my 5+ original viewings, I settled on: This MUST be a comedywith a close second of Action/adventure + SuperHero.I think this is a very underrated film. It was a very old concept that was a ton of fun, thanks to Jim Carrey at his peak and newcomer, Cameron Diaz who (almost) stole every scene she was in. She was gorgeous and talented and it was hard to believe that this was her first outing. Honestly, as much as I do like her, but not so much every movie she's been in – though I do enjoy a lot of her films, she was fantastic in this. And I understand that dog was like a prop, I still LOVED little Milo. You have to suspend your disbelief a lot during this movie, so you might as well believe all the dog accomplished.This movie is so straight forward to typical movie viewers and still, it's a lot of fun.

26,ElMaruecan82,"Dr. Carrey, Mr. Mask ... and the cinematic tribute to the greatest cartoon director!...",8,10 March 2016,"Along with ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"", Chuck Russell's ""The Mask"" is part of that 1994 trinity that finally, and forever, put Jim Carrey in Hollywood map. He was certainly a successful and relatively known comedian before but I'm sure the size of his house and the relationship with his banker had considerably improved in 1995.And it was a deserved success, as only the big screen could do justice to this face-of-thousand-faces, to this extraordinary elasticity and capability to transform into a celebrity or to express any possible emotion, or both. Just look at Carrey becoming James Dean, it takes him a few seconds but it's like watching a live metamorphosis and the result is outstanding, he seems to have a rubber-made face that can use every single muscle. And when you see the two other movies, you realize that Carrey has elevated the word 'grimace' to the rank of high art, and that in fact, he didn't need the mask to be the Mask, still, he needed ""The Mask"" to show that he was Carrey before the Mask.Indeed, the paradox of ""The Mask"" is that it uses Carrey's talent with a device that is a green rubber mask and one of the first use of CGI to create Tex Avery-like special effects, and that premises gives the misleading impression that the faces Carrey makes are the results of special effects. Yet, this paradox helps the movies and Carrey's career as well, as it allows him to play a more human and appealing character than Ace Ventura and Lloyd Christmas. As the meek and shy Stanley Ipkiss, Carrey can let his more sensitive side being expressed and create a likable character in the same vein than Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin and let his Mask-counterpart act like Harpo Marx.Ipkiss is a timid bank clerk who's get bullied by everyone and he has no one to vent his anger on, he just comes back home, talks with his dog Milo and watches a few Tex Avery cartoons and envies the wolf's exuberance and liberty. It's like Jim Carrey wishing to be Jim Carrey. We finally have glimpses on a realistic facet of the actor's range and it does have a few serious undertones as it explores the traditional 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde' dual personalities theme with a sort of Faustian notion that there's a price to pay for being better by cheating, that it might lead to mayhem and a false impression of happiness. But he's only human and when he discovers that mask on the beach, he can't resist.And he has a taste on how it feels to live like a Tex Avery character and becomes one of the greatest creation of the 90's, a guy dressed in the typical zoot suit and act like a real version of Genie from ""Aladdin"" with some of the obnoxiousness of Ace Ventura. Yet, there's no doubt that ""The Mask"" is 100% original creation, and a source of gags and music like no comedy had provided since the Golden Age. The film is punctuated by great musical numbers, a magnificent Cuban party, a Konga with policemen and prostitutes, some impressions where Carrey can deliver his comical talent and so many unforgettable punchlines as ""Smokin'"" or ""Somebody stop me!"".But if it wasn't just for a series of 'unstoppable' stunts, musical vignettes and other comedic numbers, the film would have quickly become redundant. There's also great performances, besides Carrey who, for once, is allowed to tone down his usual zaniness and shows a true vulnerability, and manages to look sweet and handsome. There's the scene-stealing dog, who has a great talent to read the lips, and it contributes to one of the film's best gags, totally lost in the original French version I saw and it tells something when the film's best gag doesn't involve the main character.And there is the love interest, played by Cameron Diaz, in a film debut kids who became teens in the mid-90's never forgot, I plead guilty as I remember having rented the VHS only for her entrance and the nightclub sequence. Diaz is amazingly sexy, sensual and beautiful as the equivalent of Tex Avery red-headed pin-up, it's not just the body but perhaps her smile that makes her so appealing, but Diaz just doesn't play the pin-up, she's as convincing in her acting as Carrey and even pulls out dramatic expressions when the situation requires it. Both Carrey and Diaz deserve credit for their performance, and the scene where they dance together is the greatest tribute to Tex Avery, and the film had me if only it gave tribute to my favorite cartoon director.It was 'no holds barred' with Tex Avery, but that's not true, Tex Avery cartoons, as crazy and nonsensical as they were, were not just successions of fourth-wall-breaking moments, mindless screams, wild explosions or chases that never added up to the plot, don't get ""The Whacky World of Tex Avery"" and good old Tex Avery cartoons mixed, Avery was a storyteller, and ""The Mask"" doesn't take its zaniness for granted and can afford a good plot with an obligatory antagonist, well-played by Peter Greene, a mid-90's figure who seems to have disappeared from the screen (he was Zed in ""Pulp Fiction"" and Redfoot in ""The Usual Suspects""), an embittered cop with his jovial assistant, and a nice climactic confrontation where the Mask shows its limits, when worn by the wrong person or animal (Muttley-like-laugh) Indeed, it's better to act according to our true nature, and it doesn't take a mask to reveal who we are, in Ipkiss' case, the mask was just the catalysis for a new departure and for Carrey's career. I have a feeling ever since he started doing these comical roles, Carrey has tried to prove he was more an Ipkiss than a Mask, this shows how defining the movie is.",The Mask
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Brilliantly rubbery, creatively cartoony effects help tell a dark, surprisingly deep story.",8,11 April 2018,"'The Mask (1994)' has some surprisingly deep allegorical undertones and a nice message about being yourself, and your best self at that, to overcome the problems you previously thought someone in a mask would be better suited to solve. It also has a real underlying darkness, which shouldn't be shocking to anyone familiar with the much harsher and more cynical source material, which contrasts nicely with the cartoony powers possessed by the wearer of the eponymous facial facade. This is one of my favourite comedies because the humour comes from such an honest place, our hero first hiding his insecurities and then them being unceremoniously released in sometimes creepy ways, and the story itself works incredibly well without relying on its laughs as a crutch. It does all this while using its incredibly inventive and wonderfully realised rubbery, real-life toon aesthetic to brilliant effect. This is a real highlight of Carrey's career. 8/10",The Mask
28,bowmanblue,Still great after all this time,9,25 January 2016,"I haven't watched 'The Mask' for years and I was actually wondering how well it would stand up after over twenty years. Back in 1995 Jim Carrey was Hollywood's (comedy) golden child. Everything he touched was Box Office dynamite. However, since then, his offerings have been a little more hit and miss (don't get me started on 'Dumb and Dumber To!'), but I'm pleased to say that The Mask still shows off his manic persona and comedy timings.I have a feeling 'The Mask' was based on a comic book, but I haven't read it! Therefore, I can't really say how well it's transferred across to the big screen. Although I can say that it works. Carrey plays a – depressingly average – guy who's too nice for his own good. Everyone takes advantage of him and his life is pretty awful. Naturally, when he finds a mysterious wooden mask that when worn transforms him into a green-faced superhero, he chooses to fight crime, protect the weak and generally stand up for justice. Or rather he kind of considers all those options. He mainly just uses his new powers to get back at all those people who have wronged him and do his best to woo the – then unknown – Cameron Diaz.Yes, the story is hardly original and, if you've seen any of Marvel's latest offerings, it's pretty much identical to every other superhero film, i.e. man gets superpowers, man fights crime, defeats villain and gets girl. But, don't let any small lack of originality put you off. It's not there to be a great work of art with deep and meaningful prose and character arcs. It's there to entertain, utilising Carrey's full repartee to the max.The manic jokes come thick and fast. Normally, the best films are 'team efforts' when the cast all play their parts. Not here. Here it's just Carrey, Carrey, Carrey. He steals every scene and created a thousand new catch phrases in the process.It's a fun film and it should be enjoyed by everyone. It's simple enough to be understood and enjoyed by children and it's just dark enough to appeal to adults.100% prime Carrey (and Cameron Diaz is pretty good, too).",The Mask
29,g-bodyl,Fun to Watch!,8,6 July 2011,"1994 has been a kind year for Jim Carrey. That year is what gave him his long, stellar career. He starred in Ace Ventura:Pet Detective, Dumb and Dumber, and now the Mask. I thought this movie is the best out of the three. I really enjoyed this movie a lot.This is about a guy named Stanley Ipkiss who is a bad luck guy. He finds an ancient, Viking mask that has special powers. When he puts the mask on, he becomes a fun character.I think that this movie proved that Carrey can do just more than comedy. He can also do drama. He was very fun to watch. This is also Cameron Diaz's first movie. She is very good looking in this movie.Overall, I had a fun time watching this. It's a nice movie to watch over and over. I rate this film 8/10.",The Mask

33,inkblot11,"There's absolutely no masking of the fun here, this film is hugely entertaining",9,22 December 2008,"Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a glorified bank teller and a shy, ""nice guy"". This means his salary, prestige, and success with women are very limited. Living in a small apartment with his faithful dog, Milo, and with the landlady from Hades next door, Stanley keeps trying, nevertheless. When the lovely Tina Carlisle (Cameron Diaz), a lounge singer, comes to open an account, Ipkiss is more than attentive and gracious. One day later, his car breaks down and he is also thrown into the gutter by a pretentious nightclub bouncer. Ending up in a river, our hero finds an old wooden mask. For some unknown reason, he takes the relic home and flings it onto the couch. But, aha! That mask is magic and the following evening, Stanley is compelled to put it on. From that moment, Stanley is transformed, when the sun goes down, into a green-faced, super-powered, ultra-confident man. Heading toward the nightclub where he was rejected, he scores a hit with the crowd and with the lovely Tina. But, during the night, he also beats up some thugs and scared his landlady, so the police detective (Peter Riegert) comes by to ask questions. With the mob gaining power in the town, especially Tina's horrific boyfriend, Dorian, the detective wants to curtail the criminal activity. But, can Stanley avoid the urge when the mask's powerful magnetism comes calling? This is a hugely entertaining film that masks none of the fun from its intended audience. Although there is enough violence and sexual connotations to make the film unsuitable for the youngest, older children and adults will delight in the flick's antics and Carrey's irresistible performance. As the man who goes from ""zero to hero"", Carrey's genius for physical comedy is a total delight. The supporting cast is also nice, with Diaz a huge asset in her first major film, for she is utterly gorgeous and sweet. Riegert, too, is dead-pan fun as the uber-serious detective, while all of the other cast members give equally memorable turns. The setting in seedy ""Edge City"" is marvelously tacky while the costumes, especially Tina's knockout outfits, are very nice. As for the script, the direction, and the special effects, they are all beyond great. Miraculous might be a better word! In short, if your goal for an evening's film choice is to laugh, laugh, and laugh some more, here is a first tier candidate. It would be difficult to see anyone not having a swell time while watching The Mask.",The Mask

35,The-Sarkologist,A Whirlwind of Fun and Amusement,8,12 October 2013,"This is one really impressive movie. It's style seems to be 1940's retro and is like a living comic book on screen. I quite like the comic book style movies, that is if they are done well, and this movie has been crafted brilliantly. The Mask is not a deep movie, but rather it is a fun movie where we watch Carrey's talent blossom in a character that was almost made for him.Stanly Ibkiss (Jim Carrey) is a nerdy bank clerk with a heart of gold. To him the world seems to be going against him because he is basically used, abused, and then discarded by all around him. Then one night he finds a mask floating in the harbour, and when he puts it on, in a whirlwind, he becomes a comic book superhero.I won't go deep into the movie, but rather discuss the one thing that seems to come out of it, and that is the idea about masks. Ibkiss is naturally a funny and delightful fellow, however this changes when he puts on the mask, because while his heart doesn't change, his confidence does. In a way it is Ibkiss' lack of confidence that lets him down. However, as we come to realise at the end of the movie, Ibkiss doesn't need the mask to be confident, or even a super hero, because all the mask does is that is amplifies what is already there. Ibkiss realises that he does not need the mask to be a super hero, so finally discards it and becomes himself.I guess the major theme here is to be one's self, and as such things don't matter. We shouldn't try to be somebody that we are not because if we do that we only end up fooling ourselves. Further we should not let others define who we are because the only person who and define who we are are ourselves. Ibkiss thought that he needed the mask to be somebody but in the end realised that the mask was nothing except something that drew his true self out from himself.I could rave on a bit more about this movie but I won't because I really don't need to. This is a superbly good movie and it is one that is really enjoyable to watch, and makes a far better movie that Carrey's earlier Pet Detective.",The Mask

41,filipemanuelneto,To laugh until you can not bear it,7,29 November 2016,"The film is slightly inspired by a Gothic comic magazine, where a mask is responsible for the irrational and dangerous attitudes of several people. The film, devoid of this negative charge, is a comedy that marked the nineties and revolves around Stanley Ipkiss, a naive and romantic banking employee played by Jim Carrey. He is the happy owner of a rudimentary wooden mask, of Viking origin, which he discovers to have the gift of freeing the desires and behaviors normally withdrawn by people due to fears or social conventions. The mask also gives its wearer an unusual resistance, speed and invulnerability.The film was one of the most thrilling successes of the career of Jim Carrey, who was for a decade the king of comedy in Hollywood. The actor shows to be tireless, giving the film a contagious energy. Carrying the film on its back until the end, Carrey laughs and makes laugh countless times, never losing the focus of his character and all the emotions he need to show. After all, Ipkiss is not a clown, but a loser with deep feelings and a lot of solitude. A true test of versatility which paved the way for other comedies, without closing doors to a lot of dramatic works, in which the actor would prove to be resourceful and talented. Cameron Diaz enters the film through a very simple and little-worked character. Thought as a supporting character, it would have been mere figuration with lines if the actress did not strive to do a decent job with the meager material she received. Special effects and animation are a focal point of the film, and have been brilliantly performed. The photograph is very elegant, with attractive colors and a good light.",The Mask

44,jzappa,A Candy-Coated 1990s Madcap Patchwork,8,17 November 2010,"I guess the reason why I liked this movie so much as a kid can't be safely detached enough from the reason why I found it so pleasant revisiting it on a whim. So I'll just get it out of the way now: Yes, I still get choked up when Stanley's dog Milo cries for him outside of the jail. OK? There. But it's not just that. It's that this dog, really named Max, is not just a prop; he's a bona fide character. Few movies have taken it upon themselves to really give the dog something interesting to do, but this dog not only emotes to tear jerking effect but also performs exciting unexpected feats, following the bad guys' car, intercepting the mask from the bad guys, all done to please an audience of children, of course, but nonetheless done exceedingly well to that end.The opening shots of The Mask give the impression they were recovered from a distraughtly shoestring 1950s sci-fi movie. Marine salvage operations bring about the breakage of an antiquated trunk that's lay for lifetimes on the bottom of the cove, and a peculiar wooden mask drifts to the surface. Shortly thereafter, unhappy bank teller Stanley Ipkiss, an amiable geek played by Jim Carrey, is gazing into the murky waters after a frenzied night of embarrassments. When he glimpses the mask drifting with some debris, he for some inexplicable reason thinks it's a man in trouble and jumps in to save him. All he retrieves is the mask.Metamorphoses are naturally the heart of comic literature. Billy Batson yells ""Shazam,"" Clark Kent scurries into a phone booth, Bruce Wayne slides down the pole, and invariably an inconsequential pushover befits a comic-strip hero. No wonder pubescent kids react to these stories so fiercely. Think about what happens to Stanley when he dons the mask. He's instantly changed into a delirious cyclone of aggravated liveliness, clad in a banana-yellow zoot suit, a intersection congealing the Joker, Aladdin's genie, and rudiments of The Shadow.One of the crucial design choices must've entailed the Mask character's makeup. It renovates Carrey's facial appearance into a much bigger, comic-bookish caricature, while all at once the facade is still able to authentically move. The effect is a movie character who appears half genuine, half comic strip. And director Chuck Russell is up to utilizing special effects to shift easily between what might be possible and what is unquestionably not, as the Mask spins like a fast-tempo jazz hydrometer and gleefully triumphs in circumstances that would've overwhelmed poor Stanley.The plot starts with luckless Stanley utterly smitten with statuesque client Tina Carlyle, Cameron Diaz's debut. She trifles with him in the bank while taking clandestine videotape of the vault for her boss, the violent Dorian Tyrel (a quite well cast Peter Greene), who manages the Coco Bongo Club, where, sure enough, Tina's the catlike diva. The plot otherwise features Richard Jeni as Charlie, Stanley's sounding board, who familiarizes him with the charades of the Coco Bongo Club; Peter Riegert as a cop who notes the Mask's tie lookss to be of the same cloth as Stanley's unbelievable pajamas; and Milo, Stanley's dog, who's no less than as cunning as his master.It's also this manic energy and 1990's madcap patchwork that holds together a narrative that is every trace as imitative and baseless as it can be. The art design on the movie goes for the loudest possible 1940s film noir aspects of plenty of superhero comics, and the Coco Bongo Club seems reprocessed from Criss Cross or Out of the Past. Stanley's apartment looks like an adolescent boy's bedroom; all that's lacking is a sign on the outside of the door saying ""No Girls Allowed!"" The appearance of the film is as much entertainment as anything else. It's been alleged that one of the crucial traits of an actor is a capacity to share the delight he takes in his performance. You could say The Mask was anchored in that.",The Mask
45,Vartiainen,Jim Carrey is the man,6,9 August 2019,"In The Mask a demonic visage gets released upon the world and ends up in the hands of Stanley Ipkiss, a frumpy bank clerk with something of a bone to pick with the world. It transforms him into a living cartoon character, with the power of violent slapstick on his side. And in a moment of perfect casting they got Jim Carrey to play this role.The idea is a fun one and Carrey is definitely enough of a rubber face to pull it off, even though the actual mask is mostly handled with CGI. It mostly captures the essence of Carrey, but I have to admit that something is lost in the translation. Carrey is very good when out of the mask, but I have to admit that part of his charm is the fact that he's so cartoon like in real life. When you make him an actual cartoon character, it loses something.I also have to admit that the humour is missing something here. I read that they had to scrub a lot of the visual gags for budget reasons, and it kind of shows. There are some good jokes here and there, but most of them are merely okay. The movie is at its best when it simply allows Carrey to sink into a comedy routine, but that's rarely the case.Still, if you're a Jim Carrey fan, the film is definitely worth a watch.

Jim Carrey owns this film,7,12 November 2010,"This was on TV last night and as I am a fan of Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz(it was her movie debut)I decided to watch it again.The movie is based on a comic by Dark Horse and it tells the story about a timid mild-mannered man named Stanley Ipkiss(Carrey) who is how shall I put it a kinda guy who wouldn't be a hit with the ladies and is a bit shy. One stormy day and a beautiful young woman named Tia Caryle(Diaz) comes in and Stanley is smitten by her unaware she is the girlfriend of a gangster called Dorian(Greene). One night Stanley is humiliated as the car he had on loan gives up on him on a bridge and he spots something in the river and thinks its a dead body. Turns out its an enchanted mask that has special powers(apparently its suppose to be the god Loki who was banished into this wooden mask many years ago). As Stanley loves cartoons one night he decides to put it on and what do you know it wraps on his face and he twirls around like that Tasmanian devil in the Looney Toons and is transformed into an over the top crazy womanizing cartoon like creature who is dubbed ""The Mask""or as the comics would say Big Head.I loved the part where the mask takes out a condom out of his pocket and does bizarre impersonations of Elvis Presley and some other people. Another is the Hey Pachuco scene with Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz dancing together.Jim Carrey has to be the most wackiest actors I have ever seen in my entire life. He is so OTT and so loony yet you gotta love the guy as his just so adorable here. Plus his my favourite comedic actor of all time next to Robin Williams. Cameron Diaz was pretty darn good in this flick too as Jim Carrey's love interest Tina Carayle. It may have scare the crap out of me as a child,but having said that its very funny. The special effects are very well done especially the make up effects on Carrey as The Mask done by Greg Cannon.Keep an eye out for a Jack Russell named Milo who is so hilarious and adorable.I'll give it a 7.8/10. Very good.Beware of the sequel Son Of The Mask,it is terrible.Edited on the 15th of July 2019Best part: The Cuba Pete number or anything where Carrey is the mask.Worst Part: Not much of Jim Carrey as The Mask and can be a tad bit scary for a younger audience.",The Mask

Then Milo, Ipkiss' dog uses the mask's power to take on the gang himself. It was a blast! A super hit for Carrey, don't get me wrong, this movie was not a letdown, not one bit! This will be another notch in his belt of hits. Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!",The Mask
49,FiendishDramaturgy,Clearly Carrey's Best,9,9 March 2007,"Jim Carrey's style is considered by most fans to be over the top. So how do you cast a man like that? You give him a script like the Mask, that's how.This is by far Jim Carrey's best work. There are some that are AMONG his best, but this is THE best I've seen him do.A Cheezy but highly amusing storyline, great dialog, innovative dance routines, and great characters dominate this work, and Jim Carrey purely DELIVERS! You could do a LOT worse with 2 hours of your life.It rates a 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Mask
50,XweAponX,Brilliant,10,26 July 2018,"This was the perfect casting of Jim Carrey ever, and the best comic-book based film ever made. Hands down.And although Carrey has made other interesting and funny films, none have utilized his abilities as this practically made-for-Carrey film has.The Mask as a character itself is based on all of those cartoons with the redhaired dancer and the wolf, many were made during the WW-II years. One of them even had Red Riding Hood being eaten by the wolf at the end, or at least sitting in his pot.This was as clever casting as Robin Williams in ""Aladdin"" or ""Mrs Doubtfire"", something which we'd never see again. I believe there was even a sequel that is so im-memorable, that it's not even linked to this film in an IMDb search.That's where this film has a commonality with the Disney Aladdin films, you cannot do a sequel if you cannot reproduce a once in a lifetime performance.It's that personalities like Carrey and Williams are so dynamic that you can't just replace their characters with new actors.There were a lot of great character actors in this as well, including Carrey's landlady.This film could have had a good sequel, should have had one. I had never heard of this director, but he did a great job especially with the primitive CGI, very similar to Burton's work.It wasn't just Carrey, this was very well directed. And Cameron Diaz did not hurt, either.",The Mask
51,CubsandCulture,The technical aspects hold up really well-the comedy is pretty good too.,8,7 May 2021,I saw this back in 1994; it is a fun film that is one of the better zany Carrey comedies. If you like Carrey's sense of humor-I generally do!-you should find this funny enough. There's not much that has dated badly in terms of the comedy. The story is overly cluttered and convoluted. There's a stronger plotline involving Ipkiss just handing out just desserts to people that is hinted at in the film. The gangster (sub)plot is unneeded and not all that compelling or funny. But Carrey is manic enough to have most of the gags land.With that said when I re-watched this today-in 2021-I was surprised by how well the CGI and other effects have held up. They look better-as in they convey the idea the film is going for-than a *ton* of CGI from the same time period-including Forest Gump (which won the Oscar). Some of this is that film is not intending the CGI to be 100% photoreal as it is aiming for cartoony images. But it is also the technicians' skills and some happy accidents. I suspect the mask's color-a shocking green-made the effects easier to work with. I found the effects compelling in their own right. If nothing else this is a good film to look at.,The Mask

53,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Jim & Cameron dazzle!,10,17 November 2005,"First of all, I'd like to say that Jim (Carrey) and Cameron Diaz dazzle together as a mild-mannered bank clerk and a sultry nightclub singer. You guys are great! The first time I saw it, I didn't even know it was Cameron Diaz portraying Tina Carlyle. When I saw THE MASK again for the first time in five years, I was surprised to find out that it was her. I practically cheered when Stanley/The Mask (Jim Carrey) beat the daylights out of Dorian (Peter Greene). I thought The Mask was a funny guy. Another thing that I liked about the movie were the songs that were performed at the Coco Bongo. I especially loved the swing piece that was performed. The song that made me laugh the most, though, was ""Cuban Pete."" In my opinion, Tina (Cameron Diaz) sounded good when she sang ""Gee Baby, Ain't I Good To You?"" You go, girl! The special effects were very intriguing in my opinion... especially the transformations from man to ""Mask."" In conclusion, I highly recommend this smash hit to all you Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz fans who have not seen it.",The Mask
54,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Classic Carrey,9,11 January 2016,"Jim Carrey careens through The Mask like Gumby on coke, a hopped up ball of energy that lights the screen up in glorious craziness that's pretty out there even for him. In casting a character that basically becomes a loony toons character in real life, they hit the nail on the head with Carrey, and he delivers in a tour de force piece of physical comedy that put him on the map in a huge way. Also bursting onto the scene in her official breakout role is Diaz, playing the luscious Tina Carlyle, a sultry lounge singer. Carrey's eyeballs pop out and his tongue rolls onto the table when he sees her dance. Audiences had the same reaction, and her work here catapulted her into the stardom we see her in today. Carrey plays mild mannered bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, a pitifully beta push over who's about as good at talking to girls as he is dealing with his domineering boss and witch of a landlady. He's a wimp, a thorough Nancy boy, a set up which makes the eventual metamorphosis into The Mask all the more delectable of a payoff. When he hits proverbial rock bottom, he finds an ancient looking Mask in the harbour, and takes it home. Upon putting it on, he transforms into a living, breathing representation of his innermost desires and feelings, bursting out in a deliriously zany, green faced maestro of mayhem that can pretty much do..anything. It's somewhat Freudian, and there's even an interlude with Ben Stein as a droll psychiatrist who ponders Ipkiss's sanity before booting him from his office. Carrey as The Mask is the star of the show, an ever wisecracking ball of slapstick glee and mirth, whirlwinding his way from one over the top encounter to the other, with his trusty dog Max. He's finally given the stones to take what he wants, albeit in violent, creepy and demented fashion, and pursue Tina, in between bank robberies, assaults, car chases and Cuban dance numbers involving a troupe of singing cops. On his tail is nasty crime lord Dorian Tyrell (the intimidating Peter Greene, having a ball) and a grouchy police detective (Peter Riegert). The film is pure 90's cheese given a shot of surreal antics. There's a whole army credited to the visual effects, and one can see why when you look at the splendour on display, rushing past at such speed and precision you'll need a re-watch just to catch it all. One of Carrey's best, a milestone for Diaz, and some of the most fun I've ever had growing up with a film. S-s-s-s-smokin!!!!!",The Mask
55,gcd70,Painful doesn't come into it!,1,2 April 2008,"One question. How is it that Jim Carrey became a household name producing garbage like this? Director Chuck Russell's ""Nightmare on Elm Street 3"" was not nearly as scary as this is stupid.Pathetic plot concerns a drop kick bank clerk's change in fortune when he stumbles upon a mysterious mask which alters and enhances the personality while controlling one's actions. Soon Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) finds he's the most popular guy in town, not only chased by a knockout blonde (Cameron Diaz) but also the cops and a nasty gangster.""Mask"" is simply a no rules, slapstick gone mad flick which relies entirely on the manic Jim Carrey and some wacky special effects. Carrey fits the bill and the f/x team do just fine, but absolutely none of it is ever funny, and isn't that the idea?I can honestly say I was tempted many times to halt the tape and give up, but I persevered for some inexplicable reason. My reward was seeing out the most baffling box office hit of recent years. Painful doesn't come into it!Saturday, November 23, 1996 - T.V.",The Mask
56,Spondonman,Why I still watch movies (metaphorically speaking),7,14 August 2005,"Although I prefer the classic 40's and 50's 5 minute cartoons of Tex Avery to this homage, I must admit it still makes me hoot with laughter whenever I see it. One of the few 90's films I've liked (out of only a few more) I think it has the edge city over Ace Ventura, equally memorable for Jim Carrey taking off Captain Kirk in the dolphin tank as well as the horrible undisciplined ending.This also has as eye-candy a shapely Cinderella Cameron Diaz who is marvellous - as someone to paint a few little dresses on. Rather smoking for the eyes, I concur with Wolfie. The biggest star however was Milo, what a masterful yet restrained performance, basically as straight-dog to Ipkiss in either form. The two cops were a throwback to 40's style films too, such as the Falcon, Boston Blackie etc - no one is that dumb in real life, uh?The Mask has to be the best comedy film in decades, probably the best film of the 90's full stop, and I'm so glad a sequel never materialised.",The Mask
57,Spleen,How to cast Jim Carrey,8,19 December 1999,"It's hard to use Jim Carrey in a movie.  He's very good at his rapid-fire mimicry routine, but how can it ever be anything other than a diversion from both character and story?  (Very rarely is it a pleasant diversion.  `Ace Ventura' was unendurable.)  And yet, what else can you do with him?The `Mask' solves the problem so neatly it almost cheats.  The story is ABOUT someone with a double life - so by day, Carrey does all the character and story stuff, and by night, wearing the mask, he does his stand-up schtick.  The two are as integrated as they need to be.  It's pulled off with such an air of innocence I can't possibly complain.  SOME of the clichés (those to do with the police especially) are so very worn out that even the most thorough of movie-goers is surprised to find them still alive; but the writer seems to have been honestly unaware that they were clichés, so that's okay.I was told that the film is saturated with animation in-jokes.  I couldn't spot very many.  Stanley-with-the-mask has the soul of a Tex Avery cartoon character: I suspect that's all there is to it.  The computer animation, or the computer-enhancement of Carrey's animation, is tastefully done.  It never looks pasted over the top of the footage the way so much computer animation does.  (`The Mask' failed to win an Oscar in the special effects category - like so many other more deserving films, it was beaten by `Forrest Gump'.)  The Cuban dance numbers are irresistible, as is Stanley's pet dog.  Sure, `The Mask' is no masterpiece, but it's a clever, charming film that richly deserved its runaway success.",The Mask
58,Galina_movie_fan,Delightful Comedy,8,8 October 2009,"I've seen this hilarious, inventive, fast, crazy, and delightful comedy many times and it never bores me. It makes my eyes pop up and my jaw drop down not unlike Jim Carrey's Mask persona in one of the film's many incredible scenes. This is the perfect movie for Jim Carrey's talents in physical comedy. He sure had a lot of fun and improvised in many scenes doing the parodies and paying the homage to the famous movies and characters in recognizable and hilarious way. The movie made me laugh all the time; it is a perfect fun for the whole family which does not happen too often. All supporting players made the film even more enjoyable but one actor who did impossible and almost stole the central spot from Carrey was the dog, the Jack Russell Milo. What a great performance! If they ever gave the Oscars for the best animal performance, Milo would be the one to receive it. The Mask also marked the film debut for an ex- model, 22 years old Cameron Diaz, and I believe that it was one of the most stunning debuts ever. The moment, she stepped in Stanley Ipcus's (Jim Carrey) bank and his life, the new star was born. I've never seen her as beautiful as in her first movie, and her dance with Carrey at the night club has proved that she could keep up with the most amazing physical comedian of our time. Great fun. Oh yes - how could I forget the Oscar nominated special effects that made Carrey's transformations from a shy clerk to a superhero absolutely amazing. I think that this comedy is timeless and it would delight the viewers of all ages for many years.",The Mask
59,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Jim Carrey's Role,10,7 January 2012,"For the few Dark Horse Comics that have been adapted onto the big screen, this one was done right. Along with Dumb and Dumber (1994) and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), this is the other film that really had the public tracking down who in the world was Jim Carrey. In my opinion, just like how the character of Lara Croft fit Angelina Jolie really well, the character of The Mask is the perfect role for Carrey. From what we've learned about Carrey, he is a living cartoon and still loves to watch cartoons. So in a sense, being The Mask was not hard task for this actor.Originally the personality of The Mask was much more violent and brutal than the one in this film. Jim Carrey wanted to give the character of The Mask more of a comedic touch. This was a good direction to go because that IS Jim Carrey's strong point. Carrey can be psychotically funny but not psychotically insane. He even proves in this film that he can sing! Another individual who starts off her career at a promising level is Cameron Diaz. And not only did she start her career off right, but also she's now one of the highest grossing actresses. That's luck if you ask me.What's great about Carrey is how he acts. He can be great as a cartoon character AND he's even more convincing as a wimp (as his alter ego, Stanley Ipkiss). What made Carrey more effective in this film than the other two he made in 1994 was that his energy (which is pretty high), was under control. Because of that, this probably gave Carrey's character more of likableness. As Ace Ventura or Lloyd Christmas, he was more or less free to do whatever he thought was funny on screen. In movies like those, you either really love the character he plays or you absolutely loath it to no end.As for the comedic part of this film, CGI is used, but it is used as it should be used; as a tool. All the CGI does, is enhance Carrey's cartoon mannerisms into a heck of a performance. From bouncing around like a rubber ball or having his eyes popping out, it makes the scenes that are funny even funnier. There are even parts in this film that have The Mask reference other characters from other movies. Things like that are what make this film all the more better to watch. Composer Randy Edelman provided the score behind this film. I like the music that he made for this. Edelman made good use of making the music sound animated when The Mask was on screen and calm when Stanley Ipkiss took over. Although I liked the music, my real appreciation lies within the film of Gettysburg (1993). The kind of music that he made for that movie was spiritually moving.As a last comment, I would like to say that I really did like this movie. This was my first Jim Carrey movie and after watching his performance, he has become one of my favorite actors to watch. However, I would be interested in seeing a remake of this film sometime in the future. Not to say Carrey's performance wasn't good but I would be more interested to see The Mask in his true form; a brutal, narcissistic psychopath. I say this because that's what the character originally was. Jim Carrey does quote a couple of moments from the original comic book but it isn't carried out the same way in the end. As a first choice, I would like to see Carrey play The Mask again but in the way The Mask originally was. And if Carrey wouldn't do it, then I would just be in the mood of seeing how it would turn out. But to be realistic, this is probably as good as its going to get.With a role that practically IS Jim Carrey, The Mask succeeds on all levels. It's a funny comedy, with great special effects and although it's slightly altered from its comic book origins, it still leaves a memorable impression.",The Mask
60,raulfaust,"Ooh, somebody make me stop laughing!",7,3 December 2010,"I first saw this movie when I was about 7, and just saw it again (18 now). I remember it used to scary me, don't know the reason yet.The Mask involves the audience and it's impossible to not laugh in some parts. The best for me was the Mexican cop's dance, although it was totally idiot, this is the kind of comedy that makes me laugh - and the one where Jim Carrey works better. The never ending limousine was quite funny as well.I had no idea how hot Cameron Diaz was, her beauty is different from modern girls. I don't know what is it, but she attracted me in a way no other actress has done so far without being in a porn movie, so she got my respect from now on.I tend to not like action movies because they usually take longer time to finish, but this one had the ideal length to don't bother the spectator (or just a few minutes more than the ideal).

61,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,10 if you're 7,1,1 June 2017,"OK, I get it. Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies of all time. Ace Ventura Pet Detective is juvenile fun. So it's no big shock Hollywood greed-heads would want New Jerry Lewis in a movie where he can basically do his shtick and they can make a billion dollars. But painting Carrey's face green doesn't make him funnier. It just makes him creepier. Sure, there's some clever stuff in here, like his ''dying'' scene where he mimics Hollywood westerns, among other things, before parodying Sally Field's Oscar acceptance speech. Clever. Not funny. But clever. I could see this being the greatest movie of all time if I were 7 years old. But as an adult I didn't find anything funny. Not one laugh. Not. One. Depending on one's point of view, this movie's huge profitability cemented Carrey as the new comedy superstar. Lots of funny movies and $20-million paydays followed.

The mystery of the mask itself, what happens to Ipkiss, the romantic story lines: they all get progressed and slowly revealed throughout the movie, and whether or not the answers are what we want, we get them. More importantly, we're not just given answers to make way for the action. The information is drip-fed at a decent pace so the audience can enjoy the scene and then shift focus afterwards.There also has a lot of the same feeling here that one may get from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" where cartoons exist in the real world, so there is a technical feat accomplished here that could have drastically changed the movie.",The Mask
63,PredragReviews,"""No, I don't smoke, but for you? I'd shoot the Surgeon General!""",9,5 April 2017,"I have a feeling 'The Mask' was based on a comic book, but I haven't read it! Therefore, I can't really say how well it's transferred across to the big screen. Although I can say that it works. Carrey plays a – depressingly average – guy who's too nice for his own good. Everyone takes advantage of him and his life is pretty awful. Naturally, when he finds a mysterious wooden mask that when worn transforms him into a green-faced superhero, he chooses to fight crime, protect the weak and generally stand up for justice. Or rather he kind of considers all those options. He mainly just uses his new powers to get back at all those people who have wronged him and do his best to woo the – then unknown – Cameron Diaz. Yeah, the story is hardly original and, if you've seen any of Marvel's latest offerings, it's pretty much identical to every other superhero film, i.e. man gets superpowers, man fights crime, defeats villain and gets girl. But, don't let any small lack of originality put you off. It's not there to be a great work of art with deep and meaningful prose and character arcs. It's there to entertain, utilizing Carrey's full repartee to the max.I really liked this film, as I think it shows off splendidly the comedic talent of Jim Carrey at his best. This film is the perfect production for him to unleash his unique brand of comedy whether it is over the top, or damped down for a specific scene. Normally, the best films are 'team efforts' when the cast all play their parts. Not here. Here it's just Carrey, Carrey, Carrey. He steals every scene and created a thousand new catch phrases in the process. This film is a lot of fun, and director Chuck Russell does a real nice job of crafting a true to life Tex Avery cartoon that lovers of the older short cartoons will truly enjoy and ever since it was originally released in the cinema again I really loved this film and is a really true tour-de-force comedy classic and shows off the actors at their best. The soundtrack - what can I say! Jazz and swing, and the whole art decor feel of places like the Coco Bongo night club - it's just got a whole 1920's, yet modern, feel to it - it's very aesthetically pleasing. Feast on a comic book creation being transferred onto the big screen in an all time ""Carrey classic"", this film will definitely bring out your childish side.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",The Mask
64,mike48128,Strill Amazing After 20 Years!,9,26 January 2014,"Cameron Diaz (Tina) and Max the Dog (Milo) steal this picture out from under from Jim Carey, who plays ""The Mask""! ""Tina"" was supposed to be a just a live-action ""Jessica Rabbit"" but she is sexy, cute, funny and smart, and can she dance! Yes, she is the proverbial ""girl with the heart-of-gold"" but so much more. ""Max"", I hope, won some kind of animal ""Oscar"" as the tricks he does are truly amazing. The story of ""Loki's Mask"" is very simple. Put on the mask and you become just like yourself only more so. If you are shy and romantic (like ""Stanley"") you become a super-hero ""Ricky Ricardo"" impervious to bullets and bullies. If you are an evil monster through-and-through (Like Dorian) you become the devil incarnate. Fantastic CGI from ILM and a long way from the primitive CGI used in ""Jumanji"". The Mask turns into the girl-loving ""Wolf"" and several other Tex Avery cartoon characters. Bullets can't kill him. He can leap from buildings, dodge bullets and swallow bombs like Superman. In one of the best scenes, Carey becomes ""Cuban Pete"". Wearing only the green mask, he orchestrates an entire Conga-line dance number with Edge City's Police on his own without much help (if any) from ILM. It's amazing to see. There is a cruel edge to the action, as several thugs are blown away by gunfire in various scenes. Thankfully, also cut, was the Tribune newsgirl's demise (See DVD extras) which wasn't funny at all, but was in early release prints. Fictitious Edge City is only a step away from Gotham City and very ""campy"" indeed: The giant piggy bank and costumes at the nightclub. Landfill Park, complete with colorful methane gas clouds.

67,sme_no_densetsu,Still smokin' after all these years,7,25 May 2008,"Years ago this was one of my favorite comedies but when I rewatched it recently I was prepared to find that it hadn't stood the test of time. Happily, I was proved wrong.In case you don't know, the premise of this film is that 'Mr. Nice Guy' Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) happens upon a magical mask that transforms the wearer into a reflection of their innermost desires. In Ipkiss's case it changes him from a unassertive, hopeless romantic into a love-crazed wildman. The story wasn't exactly going to win any awards but it is a great showcase for some inventive comedy.Probably the reason why this movie still entertains me is because of the sheer cartoonishness of The Mask's mannerisms. Carrey is perfectly suited to mimic the sort of exaggerated physical comedy that you'd usually see in animated shorts of a bygone era. Then there's ILM to fill in the blanks with some pretty nifty special effects.This was also the introduction of Cameron Diaz, who was indeed smokin' at the time. She's charming and has pretty good chemistry with Carrey. The supporting cast is better than you might expect, with Peter Greene great as the menacing Dorian Tyrell, Peter Riegert surprisingly ideal as Lt. Kellaway and even a typically understated appearance by Ben Stein.The direction is nothing to write home about but there are a few musical numbers that have a cool, jazzy flavour to them. Like the physical comedy, they're like something out of a bygone era, and all the more welcome for that.So, there you have it; a film that's good for a few chuckles.

71,BrandtSponseller,Incredible success when seen as a surrealistic cinematic pastiche,10,22 February 2005,"Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a bit of a dorky pushover. For example, he buys hot concert tickets to try to get a date with a fellow bank employee he's been pining after, but she easily scams him into keeping the tickets for herself, and he is too weak to publicly object. But when he comes across an ancient mask of Lodi long ago discarded by Vikings who tried to bury the ""troublesome object"" at the ""end of the Earth"", he discovers it has the power to unlock his true self--suave, smooth-talking, manic, a bit dangerous, and a hopeless romantic.The Mask was a perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. It not only allowed provided the perfect justification to flamboyantly engage in his rubber-faced antics in a manner even more over-the-top than what he'd become famous for, but it provided an opportunity to stretch his acting chops towards a more serious side at just the right time in his career, paving the way for later work such as Man on the Moon (1999), The Majestic (2001) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004).The success of the film wholly depends on Carrey, as he has to sell his characters' frenzied insanity so that it's believable as a reflection of Stanley's inner self while at the same time likable but teetering on the edge of becoming obnoxiously overbearing. Of course, the amazing special effects and make-up help, as well as the clever script and more than competent directing and cinematography, but with the wrong actor in the part, the whole affair could have easily collapsed. The other cast members are fine in supporting roles, with Cameron Diaz coming across as being almost otherworldly beautiful, but Carrey is rarely off-screen, and rightly so.The Mask is notable for both spoofing almost the whole history of cinema while at the same time respectfully paying homage to it. The audience is treated to everything from silent film slapstick to lavish musical numbers (with excellent songs), frenzied Tex Avery-styled animation to gangster film suspense. On its surface, the film is a crazy, often funny, hyperactively paced cinematic pastiche.The subtext about identity and public faces versus private selves is interesting, but not the focus. It would be fine to explore further, but to do so in this particular film would have taken too much time away from Carrey's surrealistic tour de force. Besides, we've had later films where that subtext has been closer to the heart of a story, such as Catwoman (2004), and where it was very thoroughly and competently dealt with.Many aspects of The Mask differed from the comic book source material, but this is a case where the changes led to such an excellent result that most people have forgotten about the source material and primarily remember Carrey's performance in this film as definitive.",The Mask

It's not really an obsession, but Jim Carrey is my favorite actor. The Mask is a fun film that really is a film that most people may not appreciate. Well, some may, some may not. I truly do appreciate The Mask because for a film that came out in 1994, it was pretty neat. I also thought it was pretty funny and pretty fun. I didn't really have a problem with The Mask, because I can't find much wrong with it. It's a cartoony film that has a great cast, which introduced Cameron Diaz, who I also like. Whatever Cameron Diaz is in I am most likely to see it. Like I had no intention on seeing What happens in Vegas, but I saw it. I really liked The Mask, though it is a little silly at times, it's still really funny and pulls itself together.

74,sarastro7,Superlative superhero comedy,10,26 October 2008,"Being a superhero comics reader, I tend to see The Mask primarily as a superhero movie. When I look at the best superhero movies yet made, the list of really good ones is quite short. The first X-Men movie was good, the Spider-Man movies are decent, and the best of the lot may be Mystery Men. I also like Sky High. But, one I frequently forget to consider is The Mask. It is actually just as good as Mystery Men, and so one of the two best superhero movies yet. It is a total comedy classic, also in terms of Jim Carrey's acting. Everything is done perfectly and for reasons that make sense to the plot, and it's just fantastically funny: ""I can explain everything!!"" ""Explain THIS!"" ""Ummmmm....""Taking its cues from Tex Avery cartoon is genius, and complementing everything with superb (for the time) special effects that still hold up today is just brilliant. This movie has it all, and it all gels in perfect hyper-slapstick harmony. The story is cool, the acting and casting are inspired, and Cameron Diaz is pitiably innocent and adorable.A fine, fine piece of movie-making.9 out of 10.",The Mask

76,hall895,Not smokin',5,18 February 2011,"The Mask is a movie which certainly has some positive things going for it. But there are plenty of things working against the movie too. In the end it all balances out to leave us with a movie which isn't great but isn't terrible either. There are some good things to appreciate but not enough of them to prevent the movie from ultimately being somewhat disappointing.The story follows shy, luckless, dorky Stanley Ipkiss. An ordinary guy. Ordinary that is until he finds an ancient wooden mask which when he puts it on transforms him into a wacky, green-headed superhero. He's a crazed whirling dervish with all kinds of wonderfully exploitable powers. He's got speed, he's got strength, he seems indestructible. And he can conjure anything he wants out of thin air. Stanley's luck is about to change. Now he can exact revenge on his tormentors. And he can get the girl. Yeah, there's always a girl.This is a seemingly perfect movie for Jim Carrey, enabling him to just go nuts. A guy like Carrey can have a lot of fun with something like this. Which makes the fact that the movie so often seems devoid of fun rather puzzling. Oh, Carrey surely has his moments. But somehow, even with the bundle of energy that is The Mask at its heart, the movie often is a little dull. Too much dead space between Carrey's best moments. And while Peter Greene does fine in playing the movie's main villain Dorian Tyrell the rest of the bad guys leave a lot to be desired. You don't expect the actors playing the thugs in a movie like this to all be little Brandos and De Niros but is it so much to ask that the actors at least be competent? No such luck, it's strictly amateur hour with these guys. Some truly cringe-inducing acting. Everyone involved, from Carrey on down, is not helped by a script heavy on puns which are very hit and miss. Carrey is so manic that he can make most things work and at least extract a mild chuckle from the audience. Other performers aren't so fortunate.The film has its good pieces. The visual effects are undeniably terrific, the film looks great from beginning to end. Carrey does an admirable job bringing his crazed character to life. And there is one thing about the movie which is indeed ""Smokin!"" That would be Cameron Diaz. She plays the aforementioned girl for whom Stanley longs. To say Diaz is a jaw-dropper in this, her film debut, doesn't even begin to do her justice. And besides looking ridiculously, impossibly gorgeous she shows she can actually act too, so that's a nice bonus. You've got Carrey, you've got Diaz, you've got a decent lead villain and those dazzling effects. But it doesn't all quite add up. The story lets down the movie. It's not consistently funny enough and there are times where the story really struggles for any momentum at all. At times, too many times, things are rather mundane. And mundane is not what you're looking for when you turn Jim Carrey into a whirling dervish superhero.",The Mask
77,Beta_Gallinger,The total amount of laughs and excitement added up earns this an 8/10 in my book,8,1 July 2008,"I was just under eight years old when ""The Mask"" was released, but I probably heard about it around then. I also first saw the film probably as early as 1995, though I'm not sure if I saw the whole thing. My clearest memory of that experience is the scene where Jim Carrey puts the mask on and says, ""It's party time!"" I saw it again a few years later, in my early teens (left with a clearer memory of it that time), and have seen it twice within the past couple years. I may not have enjoyed the second viewing of the two QUITE as much as the first, but it at least came close, and was still a lot better than the last Jim Carrey movie I watched, ""Liar Liar"".Stanley Ipkiss is a shy bank clerk who is easily pushed around and can't seem to ever be romantically successful. However, after one unlucky day, he finds a mysterious mask floating in the water near the bridge! He takes it back to his apartment with him, where he tries it on, and it magically turns him into a crazy, powerful, tough, aggressive, green-headed alter ego, The Mask! He doesn't know this at first, but this mask is an ancient one that represents Loki, the Norse night god of mischief! As the Mask, the bank clerk begins to wreak havoc in the corridor, and then outside, where he scares off a bunch of street thugs! He then wakes up the next morning, thinking it was all a dream, but he is wrong! After this, he continues to put the mask on at night, and tends to have better luck than he did before he found it, including his luck with romance, winning the heart of his love interest, Tina Carlyle. However, nobody in the city knows who's behind this mask, and since Stanley tends to cause trouble with it on, the police are after him. Not only that, he also finds the local mob after him! The last time I watched this 1994 blockbuster, a couple nights ago, I certainly didn't find it consistently hilarious, and it took a little while for it to really pick up. The first REALLY funny part I found was when Stanley Ipkiss' borrowed car falls apart just before he finds the mask. After that, there are quite a few very funny, sometimes hilarious moments thanks to Ipkiss' green alter ego, including the part where he pretends he's dying in a mobster's arms. The Mask is a rather silly character, but that doesn't mean not funny. The humour still isn't as consistent as I had hoped, and the scene where Stanley, with his mask on, forcing everyone around to dance may be a bit overlong. However, it's not entirely the humour that's making me give ""The Mask"" an 8/10. It also gets suspenseful at times, especially towards the end. So, I couldn't rate this film any more than a 7 if it relied entirely on humour for its entertainment value, but with the humour AND adrenaline combined, I think an 8 is more like it. Also, something I got out of this film that I obviously wouldn't have back in the mid-nineties is Cameron Diaz, who is so hot here in the role of Tina Carlyle!""The Mask"" is not the greatest comedy ever made, and Jim Carrey's antics are not always funny, but they usually work, unlike in ""Liar Liar"", where his silly voices, sounds, etc. got on my nerves a bit. Here, his character's alter ego is an amusing one, and is a lot like a cartoon character, so it's not much of a surprise that this movie spawned an animated series, which brings back memories, as I saw some episodes of that cartoon during its fairly brief run and enjoyed them. If you can't stand Carrey as a comedian in general, then I'm sure his performance here would be no exception to you in this film. On the other hand, for Jim Carrey fans (or those who SOMETIMES find him funny), who want a comedy, action, and fantasy adventure, this successful blockbuster from fourteen years ago could easily turn out to be an entertaining experience.",The Mask
78,educallejero,As funny as the Hulk movies!,2,6 October 2018,"Yes. 8 or 11 years old me liked it (I don't remember loving it, even then). But my God this movie is bad. As a non Jim Carrey fan (he has a couple of actual good movies like Eternal Sunshine and Truman Show; actual comedies like Liar Liar and Dumb and Dumber; and awful disasters at comedy like Ace Ventura and Cable guy and at actual movies like Yes Man and Incredible Burt Wonderstone), I find him appealing when surrounded by a structure and story but not when he's just doing dumb faces and sounds with nothing else to support it.And this is just that. Jim Carrey doing Jim Carrey stupidity for no reason without reason and Cameron Diaz being the definition of pretty.Without any enhancing substance, this movie is nothing more than an annoying mess.It's only a two because it does have some fine set pieces in terms of production values.",The Mask
79,Stampsfightclub,Vigorous and enjoyable fantasy,8,24 March 2010,"Unlucky banker Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) discovers a mask in a river that gives him superpowers at night.The film that launched Cameron Diaz into our hearts and lives is also one of the more forgotten Jim Carrey masterpieces of slapstick comedy.When son of the mask was released 5 years ago it was slated as destroying the original concept of this film and ruining the family entertainment value of cinema and whereas plans for a sequel were originally thought up in the 90's this is a film best left alone as a sheer conceptual mind blast.Opening with an attempt at cementing some mystical origin, a scuba diver uncovers a case where the mask floats away and our adventure begins.Converting to the interior of an average bank we see Carrey's ordinary Joe conversing with a friend about concert tickets and is attire and laid back attitude instantly recognises as a push over who has no romantic socialism. Therefore cue a fresh face to give the film a far fetched romantic premise and we have a new star on our screens.Cameron Diaz, shot in one of the best making career openings ever (Megan Fox has nothing on this) director Chuck Russell chooses a soaking 20 something Diaz walking through the door before cutting back to Richard Jeni's beautifully spoken ""Hold the phone"" before switching back to the entrance and zooming in and then up to allow Diaz flicking her hair and walking confidently and purposefully towards the two star struck bankers. A moment of pure genius and idolism. As far as performances go, Diaz certainly generates the right mood for this picture, being perfectly innocent and charming, a figure looking for friendship and love, and the American certainly chances her own splendid dancing and witty humour. Whilst her comedy persona has improved through films such as My best friend's wedding this was a film that begun her road to stardom.Choosing a normal average bored character in day to day rota Carrey expands on the conventional through true wacky styling when the mask is in place. There are occasions when there is an over step of eccentric portrayal, on the park bench for example, but the majority has viewers siding with his spontaneous mischievousness. Not to forget Carrey is able to capitalise on the script through splendid catchphrases and facial expressions.The script itself is a good vs evil eventuality that adds some spice and tension in the final third whilst constantly having us smiling and laughing along with the array of familiar villains and good guys.A quick mention of the score by Randy Edelman which has a way of capturing the moment of vivaciousness perfectly whilst being sentimental when required.It may have flaws of over exuberance and a formula of eventual outcome but this is a joyous ride of passion and vigour that is certainly worth catching as a reminder of Carrey's brilliance.",The Mask
80,KnightsofNi11,Utterly pointless,4,28 October 2011,"Jim Carrey is widely known for a select few movies that he did in the mid to late 90's, along with a couple in the early 2000's. The Mask is one of the most well known of these films. Carrey stars as Stanley Ipkiss, a lowly bank clerk who stumbles upon a mysterious mask that turns him into a maniacal green faced nutcase who has the ability to do anything. The first thing he uses this mask for is to rob a bank, which sets off a whole series of events involving a ruthless band of gangsters and a beautiful night club singer named Tina Carlyle, played by Cameron Diaz in her very first feature film.Now, despite this being a well known Jim Carrey film, it's also a very bad film. This is where physical humor blows up in your face and becomes unbearably moronic and not funny in the slightest. I honestly feel sorry for the talented and actually funny Jim Carrey for being subjected to such idiocracy in this film. He can't even save the overall pathetic attempts at comedy. The jokes and physical humor in this movie range from absolutely atrocious to almost worth a chuckle, but the latter is far and few between. The majority of this film is just dull and lifeless dribble that wants to be funny but can't find the right chords to stroke. It misses the mark again and again as it becomes more ridiculous and stupid as the film goes on. Needless to say, about ten minutes into the film I couldn't wait for it to end.The problem with a film like this is that it knows its all about the comedy. It only seeks to deliver funny jokes and entertaining gags, rather than a deep and intellectual storyline and skillfully woven character development. The Mask obviously has neither of the aforementioned things, but it doesn't have the funny to replace them. The only way to really put it is that this is just not a funny movie. It isn't even painful to watch bad, it's just so dull, so lifeless, and so sloppily made and poorly constructed that I can't think anything of it.I don't want to give the impression that I possess a searing hatred for The Mask, I only want it to be known that it is just not a good film and not something worth watching. It's a waste of an hour and forty minutes, not because it is the worst movie ever made, but because it is so underwhelming and so forgettable that you accomplish absolutely nothing by watching it. There are plenty of other Jim Carrey movies worth checking out before you waste your time with The Mask.",The Mask
81,DarthBill,Somebody stop that Jim!,8,13 February 2004,"This was the movie that got me into Jim Carrey (though I'd seen him on ""In Living Color"" a couple of times), and it's still my favorite, though Ace Ventura #1 was also kind of funny.The great thing about this film is that Jim is actually really restrained all throughout, only going into goof ball mode when he puts on the Mask. He's pretty likable and engaging here, not quite as prone to irritating some audience members like he did in ""Batman Forever"" and ""Ace Ventura #2"". Cameron Diaz... my God, she looked SO GOOD here, how have her looks faded so quickly since this film? She looks so... plastic now, kind of like a giant Barbie doll.One of the big standout scenes in this one is Jim singing ""Cuban Pete"" to escape all the cops. Not that the other Mask gags are unfunny, but Cuban Pete really stands out. Too bad the cartoon Mask didn't have a little more restraint to it.",The Mask
82,Hollywood_Yoda,Totally Awesome,8,21 June 2007,"I was much younger than I am now when this film was released in 1994, but it has been a favorite since. I always did like Jim Carrey, and this was only the second film of his I saw. And this film was a starting point in Cameron Diaz's career.The acting in the film was moderate, with Jim Carrey being his exceptionally funny self, and Cameron Diaz stealing the scenes. It was hard to picture Amy Yasbeck as a backstabbing reporter who broke her silence about the Mask.It was good to see by the end that Jim Carrey threw the Mask away and got the girl. It was an excellent film, one in which thrust Diaz into super stardom. And Jim Carrey's popularity was thrust into the stratosphere with this film. The start of his major career.",The Mask
83,Ruskington,Jim Carrey at his slapstick best,6,10 April 2020,"On the face of it (sorry, couldn't resist), The Mask is a fairly awful movie. The story is ridiculous and the acting, by and large, is quite atrocious. It's essentially a cartoon with real-life humans superimposed onto it. However, thanks to the sheer brilliance of Jim Carrey, it's actually quite enjoyable. Carrey doesn't just provide huge comedy value with his hilarious slapstick antics as The Mask, he also plays the tepid Stanley Ipkiss delicately and with great restraint. His adorable sidekick Milo is a showstopper and really adds to the feelgood factor.And has there ever been a more perfectly beautiful woman than Cameron Diaz in this movie? The teenage version of me that first watched this in the 90s would probably say no.As long as you aren't expecting anything more than a screwball comedy with an over-the-top storyline and pantomime acting, I would highly recommend The Mask. It's goofy and flamboyant and Carrey is brilliant. It drags on a little too long and the bad guys get a bit tiresome but it's still a very entertaining watch.",The Mask

85,bellino-angelo2014,"Wonderfully enjoyable comedy, and one of the best movies from the 1990s",10,1 November 2019,"I always loved this movie. It's not the best movie ever made but it's among the best movies from the 1990s and one of Jim Carrey's best movies that he has ever made. He was born for this role since he has such a rubbery face and he is very energetic movement-wise. Here he is split in his dual role of Stanley Ipkiss, at day a mild mannered banker and at night when he wears the mask, he unleashes his true self: The Mask, a manic cartoon-like superhero. Thanks to CGI effects that were new for 1994 movie-goers, Carrey spins like a whirlwind when he wears the mask and moves pretty much like a cross between the Road Runner and Taz. The script is clever and funny just like the movie itself and the performances are all best-of from the stars' careers. Jim Carrey is in his natural element and Cameron Diaz here in her debut is lovely as a mobster's girlfriend. All the supporting characters, including Milo the dog and the police detective, are nice to look at. And the soundtrack is one of those soundtracks that will remain stuck in your memory forever. All in all, a great comedy highly enjoyable and much much better than the wretched Carrey and Diaz-less sequel SON OF THE MASK, that I loathed it so much that I only try to forget that it was made in the first place.",The Mask
86,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,One of my personal favorites as a child and still love it as a young adult!,10,30 August 2012,"OK, I never read the comics this was based on, but in terms of judging a comic-book movie adaptation on it's own merits, I used to watch this a few more time as a little child at the mid-90s when it was released and I loved it as much as anyone else in this website even as a young adult. Sure, it may not be the best movie, but I've seen much much worse films and I think that this is one of Jim Carrey's best films in my opinion next to Liar Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.The story is pretty engaging and has some of my favorite moments throughout the film (the casino scene, the dancing sequence, the balloon animals, and the quotes ""Somebody Stop Me!"" and more), the script's humorous and made me laugh really hard, the special effects are the epitome of greatness, and the music is good, but the strongest aspect goes to the cast especially Jim Carry which I like the best and I liked his personality (going from a mild-mannered person to a wild and crazed superhero). Cameron Diaz and others did a great job with their roles and the villain is pretty good too. The pacing is brisk and the songs are good too.Overall, love this movie as a kid and still love it as an adult and it's definitely worth-watching!",The Mask
87,Atreyu_II,This movie is a scream!!!,9,7 July 2007,"If you ask me, 'The Mask' is Jim Carrey's best work ever. It's his best movie and the only one of him I find really great. It's not a movie without its faults, but it's original, imaginative, creative and has very good comical gags. It's a classic. Or, to use only one word to describe it: ""Smokin!""Jim Carrey can be two things: either a really funny comedian either a comedian who does his job well but overacts, although no one can deny that there is a genius inside this man. In 'The Mask' he is awesome. I consider this one of his best actings of all time, if not his very best.In 'The Mask' Jim Carrey portrays Stanley Ipkiss, a clerk in a nice Edge City bank. He is a very nice and easy-going guy with great sense of humor (which matches his funny name). He is «the nicest guy», yet shy and somewhat depressed and he does not have much success in his job and personal life. He doesn't have much friends, except for his co-worker Charlie and his loyal dog Milo (a Jack Russell Terrier). Stanley likes to watch cartoons (particularly a Tex Avery one with a whistling wolf), decorates his apartment with items from these cartoons and he has the most unusual pajama :)Jim Carrey also portrays the title character (The Mask), which is the other side of Stanley Ipkiss... or at least what he wants to be but can't be without the mask. The mask gives him superpowers and courage to do things he wouldn't be able to do without it. For example, he can dance like Fred Astaire, Gumby and Barishnikov (all together) - and he can flirt with the gorgeous Tina Carlyle. The Mask is a cartoonish figure that can do incredible things.This film is a crazy comedy, a film that surpasses the limits of imagination. Yet, despite its cartoonish humor, it also works well as a thriller and has a dark atmosphere. At the same time, this movie is clearly inspired (in many ways) on several cartoons, such as the Looney Tunes, Tex Avery's 'Red Hot Riding Hood' and even the live action/animation movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. The movie also has great sceneries and backgrounds, as well as great lines, nice special effects and its magic.Cameron Diaz in this movie... my goodness! Is there any guy who wouldn't fall in love with her in this film? She was really a stunning beauty in this film. She was absolutely at her hottest and most sensual here: she was more curvy, sexier, so beautiful and her smile was even more enchanting. Her role as the gorgeous and loving Tina Carlyle was a great acting debut for her. Plus, she was great in this role. In fact, she was a better actress in her early acting years than in more recent years. And she got slimmer with time.Cameron Diaz also sings very well in this film, with a husky, jazz-like voice. What a difference comparing to 'My Best Friend's Wedding', where she sings terribly. She was 21 years old in 'The Mask' but she surely looked older than that. She is really like a live-action version of Jessica Rabbit in this film.Other funny characters (along with Stanley Ipkiss) are Charlie Schumacher, Milo, Detective Doyle and the impatient Lt. Mitch Kellaway.Most of the soundtrack is great: the opening theme and other instrumental themes during the movie and even the cheerful songs ""Hey Pachuco"" and ""Cuban Pete"" - this last one is sung by Jim Carrey himself in a hilarious part where he (as The Mask) dances and makes the policemen dance either. It really makes one wanna dance.Most actors are pretty good in their roles: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, Ben Stein, Amy Yasbeck, Richard Jeni, Nancy Fish, Jim Doughan and Max.Max is the name of the dog that portrays Milo. The intelligence of that dog deserves to be mentioned. This breed of dog is known for its intelligence and loyalty, but also for being lovable, playful and stubborn dogs. Milo is all of that. Plus, Milo seems to understand everything they tell him. When his master is giving him orders, he moves his head as if he is understanding every word that is said. Plus, he climbs a considerably tall wall to rescue Stanley and we can see in his eyes when he is feeling fear, joy and sadness, for example. What a fabulous dog actor!The loaner... what a piece of junk! That car makes its own scenes hilarious! Why? Simply because of what it is: a charger in a junkyard.Jim Carrey makes this movie as good as it is. I believe that this movie couldn't possibly be this good without the great Jim Carrey. This role was made for him and couldn't be played by other than him.This should definitely be on Top 250.",The Mask

89,emm,Unmasking the wasteful ideas from other movies.,4,28 January 1999,"THE MASK was not very good. Jim Carrey tries too hard to be funny, and seems to be the perfect role model for a guy with the green face. Wasteful are the references from vintage Hollywood movies and cartoons. Remember the old M.G.M. cartoon about a wolf who falls for a bombshell singing ""Oh, Wolfie""? That's among the plentiful you'll discover here. I also remember how this film was marketed. Why would THE MASK attract very young audiences with its killer display of tornado animations when it has enough violence to keep 'em away? This is definitely no ROGER RABBIT, and not what you're expecting!",The Mask
90,moviesleuth2,Irreverent fun!,7,26 April 2009,"If anything, ""The Mask"" could best be described as a cartoon for adults. Yes, it's a live-action film, but there's enough animation to sufficiently blur the lines between animation and live action, and the film's spirit is pure cartoonish.Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a mild-mannered bank accountant manager who's always treated like doormat, even by his friend Charlie (Richard Jeni). One night, Stanley finds a mysterious mask which when put on, unleashes his complete alter-ego, known simply as ""The Mask."" But the mask is not bound by laws (legal or otherwise, which gets Stanley into trouble, both with the law (represented by the cynical Kellaway (Peter Riegert)) and the mob (Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene)).This film is all about Carrey. While his first major foray into film, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" allowed him to perform his antics, ""The Mask"" is a better vehicle. This is because it allows computer animation to supplement Carrey's abilities. Plus, ""The Mask"" allows Carrey more creativity.Fortunately, Carrey is up to the task. Like Robin Williams, he's skilled at impersonation and animated personalities. Carrey has great fun lampooning everything to circus sideshows to the Oscars. But Carey spends only about half the movie (at most) as The Mask. As Ipkiss, he's more subdued and meek. But Carrey is equally adept at portraying someone like Ipkiss. It is Carrey's versatile skill that lets ""The Mask"" be a caricature, while Ipkiss be very real.Carrey's co-stars are great as well. This represented Cameron Diaz's film debut, and it kicked off her career with a great start as the knockout club singer, Tina Carlyle (doesn't the name just SOUND beautiful?). There are few actresses with more screen appeal than Diaz, and ""The Mask"" makes as much out of it as possible. The other female, Amy Yasbeck is frumpier, but appealing as well. Despite Diaz having a huge aptitude for comedy, she isn't given much of a chance to use it here; Yasbeck is. Yasbeck has a great sense of comic timing.Carrey's male co-stars are more varied, albeit slightly. Peter Riegert is terrific as The Mask's nemesis, Detective Kellaway. It's a familiar part in this sort of movie, the no-nonsense cop with no sense of humor. But Riegert has a few advantages: first, the law is REALLY on his side, and his banter with his dimwit partner Detective Doyle (Jim Doughan) represent some of the comic highlights. The late Richard Jeni shines as Ipkiss's friend and co-worker, Charlie. While Jeni doesn't steal any scenes (he's almost always paired with Carrey),y he has his shares of funny lines, all of which are delivered aplomb. As the villain Dorian Tyrell, Peter Greene is adequate, but not especially memorable. He's not even the best villain in the movie. That honor goes to Ricardo Matecena. He's only in two scenes, but he's noticeably more menacing than Greene, especially in his first scene.""The Mask"" represents director Chuck Russell's most memorable hit. This is because while he has a knack for visuals, his direction in other respects is bland. He works best when he makes scenes as set-pieces. Two of the best examples are the musical numbers, the first being a surprise dance number of ""Hey, Pachuco!"" with The Mask and Tina, and the second is a rendition of ""Cuban Pete"" between The Mask and the Police Department. They're both energetic and fun.While ""The Mask"" may not be the pinnacle of the genre, it's definitely worth a watch. Though I never saw it in theaters, I'm guessing it works better on video than it did in the theater.",The Mask
91,Min111,He turns into the mask,5,2 October 2014,"It's one of 'many' Jim Carrey movies - The Mask. I seen it, and I thought the movie was very entertaining! There was too much entertainment. 'The Mask' is an action, comedy and crime movie. You could also say it's a romantic movie. 'The Mask' is a movie worth watching if you're looking for something to laugh at. In fact, you'll laugh numerous times. I lost count how many times I laughed when I saw 'The Mask'. The story is about an insecure bank clerk named Stanley Ipkiss who lives in a rental apartment with his little dog named Milo. I like that dog by the way. The dog has a major part to play. Milo is my favourite character. Anyway, at the bank, Stanley Ipkiss meets a beautiful woman named Tina, and he's fallen in love with her ever since he laid eyes on her. Does Tina like him back? You need to see the movie to find out. Later, his car breaks down while driving home. Much to his frustration. He spots something unusual over the harbour bridge, so he decides to go closer to the city's harbour, but what he thought was there was indeed something else. What does he find? He finds this strange wooden mask, and he takes it back at his apartment. When he goes back home, Stanley Ipkiss puts the mask on without knowing the magical effects of it. He turns into a superhero known as 'The Mask'. His face turned green in process. He also learns that the mask's powers only work at night. I liked how Stanley Ipkiss had a lot of cash at his apartment after robbing the bank. The bad guys eventually take the money away from his apartment. I actually wanted Stanley Ipkiss to keep the money, or return it to the bank. The detective widely suspect Stanley Ipkiss to be the bank robber. His partner thinks it may have been an inside job. Stanley Ipkiss life changes dramatically with the thing he has in his possession. There were a lot of other characters in the movie. Another one of the characters I liked was Mrs Peenham who lives at the apartment. She's always furious with Stanley Ipkiss. There's also Charlie who happens to be Stanley Ipkiss best friend. He happens to work in the same bank. I really liked the part where the both of them saw Tina walking into the bank the first time. The reaction on their faces was priceless! You need to see it. I also just like how Stanley Ipkiss enjoys watching cartoons though he's a man. I'm amazed with the things 'The Mask' can do. 'The Mask' is crazy. Jim Carrey was the right man to play Stanley Ipkiss. If it was anyone else, the movie would've been a disaster. There's also an animated series of 'The Mask' which I always wanted to see as a little kid. I think 'The Mask' is also a superhero movie.",The Mask
92,Peach-2,Good film for Jim Carrey.,7,19 January 1999,"Tis is a great film vehicle for Jim Carrey and a nice little film to boot. Sure it isn't very original, but the special effects help compliment the story and the leads are well cast. Jim Carrey is terrific in 2 roles as the Mask and Stanley Ipkiss. Cameron Diaz, in her first picture, sets the screen on fire as the women of his dreams. The film is a total cliche, but I enjoyed it very much. Oh yeah, the dog was cool too.",The Mask

94,RossRivero99,A hilarious superhero comedy,7,12 June 2019,"Jim Carrey is one of the most gifted comedic actors of all time with some really funny performances in movies like 'Liar Liar"" and ""Bruce Almighty"" and this movie is no exception and is a perfect vehicle for his wild and manic screen persona. Carrey plays a bank clerk named Stanley Ipkiss who lives alone in his apartment with his little Jack Russell Terrier Milo who is probably one of the smartest and most clever dogs we'll ever see in the movies. One day on the job he is talking with his best friend Charlie (Richard Jeni) who also happens to be his co-worker when suddenly a blonde bombshell by the name of Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz in her debut movie role) who wants to make an account while flirting with Stanley at the same time but is really using the flirtation as a distraction because she's really there to retrieve information from the bank with a hidden camera in her purse and relay it to her boss/boyfriend Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) who is planning a robbery of the bank. Later that night Ipkiss is standing on the edge of a bridge and suddenly sees an odd looking mask with a bunch of garbage around it which makes it look like a person has risen from the water, and being the good samaritan that he is thinks someone is in trouble and tries to help only to realize that it's a bunch of garbage and takes the mask with him back to his apartment. He then tries on the mask and it makes him swirl like a tornado in the midwest around his apartment and the mask makes him do all sorts of crazy things throughout the movie, and Ipkiss is always questioned about the mask character by a reporter named Peggy (Amy Yasbeck) and a police Lieutenant named Kellaway (Peter Riegert) who is always on Ipkiss's tail. The movie is very funny and the special effects make the movie a whole lot funnier while aslo having very good action sequences, but the movie's real focus is the relationship between Carrey's and Diaz's characters with their excellent chemistry together. This movie makes me even more eager to see Jim Carrey in more dramatic parts after watching a movie that sometimes loses its footing a little but is injected with life everytime Carrey is in any scene in this movie.",The Mask
95,CANpatbuck3664,Carrey is Phenomenal and the Rest of the Movie Holds Up Pretty Well,9,13 November 2021,"Most of the characters in the Mask present themselves as stereotypes or stock characters but they evolve as the movie goes on. Stanley is very much the likeable shmuck, Tina is femme fatale, Charlie is the token sidekick, Kellaway is the angry cop and Milo is the comedic relief in a cute and fuzzy package. But to the film's credit, as we get further into the story, things start to change. Ipkiss is secretly super goofy and hopelessly romantic, Tina's not just with Dorian for the money, there's more to Peggy than meets the eye and Dorian's darkness is deeper than the surface level. I wouldn't claim it's a master class in character development but it's a surprise card the movie has up its sleeve. You might find yourself getting more attached than you might think, at least compared to most comedies you watch today.My comments about Carrey's performance in this may come across as hyperbolic or even unrealistic but even revisiting this today, this is a transcendent acting job. He's so perfectly cast as Stanley Ipkiss, he's not only believable and sympathetic as the repressed and downtrodden everyman but the movie pulses with comedic adrenaline every time Stanley puts on the Mask. Jim's fantastic in every sense of the word, his style meshes perfectly with the CGI and watching him do his bits with the Mask was like watching Carlos Santana play a guitar or Tom Brady throw a football. To have anyone one else playing this character would have been a great disservice to the movie. Cameron Diaz got her start here and while she's gorgeous, watching it again, I was taken aback that she did great work in this. She's not given Oscar calibre material but her talent and acting ability does shine through here. This isn't just a Jessica Alba in Sin City or Megan Fox in Transformers where her sex appeal does all the work, she does a good job being vulnerable and she has good chemistry with Carrey. Peter Riegert doesn't get enough credit for his turn as Detective Kellaway. He's really funny and with him going from serious cop to buffoon in one minute to the next, he doesn't miss a beat. Peter Greene is menacing as Dorian without being too scary or dark, he also gets a couple of chances to be funny and he's surprisingly good. Green accomplishes what this movie needs him to and I can't fault him for that. Amy Yasbeck is fun as Peggy; they pull a nice switch with her character that makes the film a little more unpredictable. Richard Jeni is also decent as Stanley's friend Charlie; he doesn't get much to do but he fills his role. I'm not the only one to point this out but if there's a most underrated member of the cast, pay attention for Anne Fletcher as the singing cop in the Cuban Pete musical number, she's only on screen for a couple of minutes but she's really memorable in such a small part. I tip my hat to her and it's the kind of thing you rediscover years later watching this again.In a surprise to everyone, one of the aspects that should be praised with The Mask is the set dressing, costuming and score. I'll start with the score which is as smooth as H$!!, the musical numbers are fantastic for a movie that's not a musical in the classic sense but even the music playing over other scenes sounds fantastic. The Cuban Pete number, might be the best scene in the movie, it gives Carrey room to strut his stuff, its offbeat and disarming and its really funny in the context of the story. There's a pseudo swing vibe to the rest of the movie that makes it stand out from the pack and the instrumental work really helps you meet the movie on its level. I don't put an emphasis on costuming normally, I'm more concerned with other things but whether it was in the comic and it was a good translation or they came up with that for the film, that yellow suit the Mask parades around in is iconic to me. Its so distinctive and I couldn't picture the character without it. Cameron Diaz also has some memorable outfits that really stood out to me after rewatching this again. Again, credit should be given where credit is due and despite it not being The Lord of the Rings or Guardians of the Galaxy, the extra work put in does transport you into this world.Despite the fact I watch this movie with rose coloured glasses, it isn't without flaws or problems. It does suffer from a tonal inconsistency, some scenes in the movie like when Niko is interrogating Dorien or eventually Niko's death are pretty dark while the rest of the movie is pretty light and breezy. It also is conversely a little too cartoonish (the movie's vibe, not Carrey's performance) in other moments. Even with the rules The Mask establishes for itself, it stretches plausibility in some scenes. I'm going to attribute that to the comic's material being much darker and them trying to translate it to the screen. I also have to point out that while it ages pretty well considering, if this movie were made today, Stanley's pursuit of Tina would be much creepier. It approaches that line once or twice but it pulls back enough to avoid most of the problematic material.I would never claim The Mask is perfect but I was so happy after finishing my viewing of it. So many movies I loved as a kid don't hold up, age well or have been deemed inappropriate due to shifting societal attitudes (Shanghai Noon or Rush Hour 2 come to mind). This movie is still a blast and unless you can't stand Jim Carrey or his antics, I can't imagine anyone not finding something they like in this film. I still love The Mast and despite the occasional misstep, I would put it on again without hesitating.",The Mask
96,policy134,Fantasy/comedy beautifully done. Carrey does his best work here.,8,25 March 2005,"It is not easy for me to say this because Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors but nothing he has done since The Mask is very remarkable or put in another way, his performance here is still his best. I didn't much care for the Ace Ventura films even though they did have a great Carrrey performance. His dramatic roles are mostly admirable but doesn't really stick with you for that long. The Mask was and still is a movie where almost everything was so beautifully done that everything else he has done feels mediocre. Especially, when you look at his other venture into fantasy film with ""The Grinch..."" it is but a mere shadow of the sublime universe that is created here.Every time we see a shot of Carrey here is like watching a hundred firecrackers going off at the same time. His Ipkiss character and what happens to him is almost every boy's dream come true. Who among us haven't wished that we could let go of all of our inhibitions and get the girl of our dreams in the process? The production design in the entire movie is also pure gold with bright colors and a film noiresque ambiance. The villain, played by Peter Greene, is also truly frightening and Cameron Diaz has never looked better. One fault i can point out is the policemen characters. They are just too buffoonish and belong on a second rate kiddie show. Other than that everything is so well accomplished that a sequel which was initially planned would have ruined the first film. I'm glad that as of this date it still hasn't been made.Jim Carrey might have ambitions to be more than just a comic actor but I think that he should be proud of this film and if he never wins an Oscar he should still consider himself the best comedic actor of the 90's. Too bad there isn't such a category.",The Mask
97,Horror-yo,Comedy Classic.,8,19 May 2016,"This film has typically gone underrated. This is Jim Carrey's introduction to the major international public, and just like every other film he'd star in, he steals the show. As I ask in almost all my Carrey-starring movie reviews: could this film have even existed, or been efficient at any level, with ANYONE ELSE but Jim Carrey ? This guy is like Michael Jordan for a basketball team. You may have mediocre coaching, game-plan or even other players, but with very little and him on your squad, you can still achieve greatness or at very least glimpses of it. People forget that underneath the graphical effects, there's Jim Carrey. He's the Mask more than CGI or costumes. The film is funny, fun, entertaining if you'll only go into it with the according mindset. It's a nice tribute to the Tex Avery's and old school cartoonish classics, and a wacky, wacky premise to even begin with. It's also got a bit of morality: we all wear masks; and also the Mask itself is only power, it is the one who wears it who determines if he transforms into a positive weirdo, or a monster. Well written, fun watch. A classic.",The Mask
98,saadanathan,Smokey!!!!!!!!! 7/10,7,20 February 2021,"""The Mask"" is one of Carry's classic films and most remarkable ones. This is the kind of movies where Jim Carry can let all his humor and comedy burst out like a parade. His portrayal both as Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask are hilarious and compelling. At one point his a complete loser during the plot and afterwards he receives this huge confidence by using the mask. It's a good conflict between two personalities of one character. Every scene with Carry as the figure of the mask is wild and funny as hell. Just shows you his such a talented person. The only thing I may have against the film is that it is another origin film of how a regular person becomes a hero. Many origin films have been made and many of them either by Marvel or DC. So it would have been nice to have a different plot going on the movie instead of the same origin story. Overall it is a fun movie to watch.",The Mask
99,TheMan3051,Awesome!,10,11 November 2002,This is easily Jim Carrey's greatest picture! Not only that but in my opinion this was one of the funniest films of the `90s.

101,richieandsam,I love this movie and can't say anything bad about it.,8,1 December 2013,"THE MASKI remember watching this when it first came out. It was such a big thing back then.The movie is about a sad lonely banker who finds a mask one day. When he goes home and tries it on the mask sticks to his face and changes him into a completely different person. The problem is, he robs a bank that a criminal organisation were already going to raid. Now they are after him as well as the police.This is a comedy that is more like a cartoon than live action. There is slapstick as well as musical sequences. But it is all so well done that you can't help but watch it in wonder.The movie stars Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz. This was Camerons first movie. She was very good in it considering she didn't have much acting experience. Jim was fantastic in this, Back in the 90s is when Jim was in his prime. He was making so many great movies back then and he was so funny. This is probably my favourite Jim Carrey film. He is still making good movies now, but they just don't seem to be as funny as the ones he made back in the day. One of my favourite characters ion the film though is not even human. Milo was fantastic. Milo was Jims dog in the movie. The dog that was used was so well trained that even he was really funny and made me laugh so much.As I said before, there are some musical numbers in the film. Yes it is done in a very cheesy way, but it fits in with the movie very well. The songs are very catchy and funny to watch... especially Cuban Pete. I actually bought the 12"" vinyl single of this back in 1994.The special effects are still very good even for now... so you can imagine how good they were when the movie came out in 1994. It really was amazing back then and it was completely awesome to watch.There is a sequel to The Mask called the Son of the Mask... avoid at all costs. It is terrible and really destroys this classic film.The Mask is so funny and very entertaining. It really is one of my favourite films from the 90s.I will give this film 8 out of 10.""Hold on, sugar!

102,Darth_Osmosis,Extremely fun!,8,12 June 2018,"The Mask is both a different kind of comic book movie and hero! If he is even a hero is debatable, but he IS the protagonist of the film! There is no life changing accident that makes him a hero or a loss that sets him on a path of the grim and dark anti-hero! His life isn't too great before getting the titular mask, but nothing is truly awful either. When he wears the mask he receives some awesome powers and turns into an exaggerated version of himself(or Jim Carrey) an overly hyperactive jester with a broken heart(or a lonely heart at least) and then the fun begins... And it is fun, this movie is outrageously fun and thoroughly enjoyable!",The Mask
103,baileycrawly,Incredible,9,12 February 2020,"I grew up with Jim Carrey movies. They were always on TBS with regular marathons and encore performances. Of everything Jim has done in his career, nothing had quite the same level of appeal and immediate likability that The Mask did. The story of a relative nobody finding an outlet through which their innermost desires could be openly and fearlessly explored resonated with me a lot. The jokes landed back then and they're still just as good now. Carrey has every bit of the charisma necessary to tackle this role properly and he does it spot-on from start to finish. This is a fantastic film to showcase why Jim Carrey was such a huge success in the 90s.",The Mask
104,DavidSim240183,Sssmokin!!!,10,14 January 2004,"I don't like all of Jim Carrey's films because his madcap antics can be so over the top and annoying at times. But The Mask isn't like that. Its hilarious from beginning to end. The plot is fairly unoriginal, a loser comes out on top story, but Carrey's performance elevates the material to classic status.Stanley Ipkiss is a meek banker who can't get anywhere. His love life is practically non-existent. His landlady has seriously got it in for him. Everybody takes advantage of him. And the worst part is, he just takes it.One night, after a humiliating encounter with the love of his life Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz in her feature film debut) at the Coco Bongo nightclub, he happens to find a wooden mask in the river. When he puts it on, it transforms him into a completely different person.The Mask as he comes to be named is obviously inspired by the Tex Avery cartoons, because he is like a human cartoon character. All his inhibitions are stripped away, and he can literally do anything he wants.Jim Carrey is perfectly suited to this character, because The Mask is such a zany bundle of dynamic energy. He is so completely mischievous and has none of Stanley's ineptitudes. The mask gives Stanley the attention and fame he has always wanted.There are many memorable scenes, made even more special because this film was one of the first to use CGI. The FX are dazzling, and really help bring the film to life. The Mask moves like a whirlwind, he has cartoon eyes that pop out on cue. His legs are as fast as the Road Runner. The delights are numerous.One of the best scenes is The Mask's Cuban Pete act when he is in a tight spot with the cops (as The Mask he robs the bank he works in). It is a marvellous dance number that would not have looked out of place in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Stanley has absolutely no control over what he does when he becomes The Mask, which is why it becomes more of a burden to him.Eventually, the mask falls into the hands of Dorian Tyrel, a local mobster. But unfortunately, he has different ambitions than Stanley. When he puts the mask on, he becomes a monster. The mask gives him the power he has always craved, and will allow him to take over Edge City. Obviously, Stanley must prevent that from happening, so he gets to play hero without the mask.Cameron Diaz is a very beautiful woman, and even in her film debut, she really proves she can hold her own. Any outfit looks good on her. She's quite charming. And she has a wonderful smile that quite lights up her entire face. I'm just glad she got the recognition she deserves.Typically, the audience knows things will turn out well for Stanley in the end, but this is still an entertaining film. Apparently, there is going to be a sequel, but it won't star Jim Carrey because he hates to do them. I'm not sure when it comes out, but it should be interesting to look at. After The Truman Show, The Mask is Jim Carrey's best film.",The Mask
105,lagudafuad,somebody stop me,7,24 December 2012,"You just have to appreciate the technicality and the visual effects that went into the production of this massive hit. The Mask introduced a character that we all started to love and cherish, a hero that can do absolutely anything his mind thinks of. This slap stick comedy showed how Jim Carrey became a good lead actor; he carried the show right from the start to the final battle, doing everything we see in the Warner bros cartoons.After this massive hit, an animated series was also done, introducing more villains and more takes into the life of Stanley Ipkiss. This movie ""The Mask"" is based on a series of comic books of the same name; the comic is the product of Dark Horse Comics and The Mask was introduced in the 80's based on a concept by the publisher Mike Richardson and created by writer John Arcudi and artist Doug Mahnke. Like in this movie the comic series follows a magical mask and its owner Stanley Ipkiss. When the mask is worn the wearer can bend reality, do the impossible physically and survive the unbelievable. All this is based on the wearer's depth of imagination which The Mask will then surpass.The plot is about a Mr. nice guy, Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) whom the world seems to step on. Things took a turn around for Ipkiss when he came across a magical mask, which gave him powers to do the impossible. But The Mask was uncontrollable and Ipkiss stepped on toes which were ready to do anything to kill the man behind the mask. The movie is filled with thrilling visual effects, and a wonderful cast. Jim Carrey was just exceptional. The Mask was also Cameron Diaz's first acting role, which later pushed her up the ladder as she now features in major movies yearly.The Mask was a huge box office hit making over 350 million from its 23 million production cost, it was also a critical acclaim, leaving behind it a trail of catchphrases in its time like ""smoking"" or ""somebody stop me"". Its high box office status made the makers approach Jim Carrey for a sequel, which he turned down (as Carrey believes making sequels are not challenging). The ideas for the sequel were then used in the animated series, which spawned two seasons. Later after 11 years, a sequel was made but it was unrelated to the first or the animated series, it was titled Son of The Mask which received high negative reviews and was a box office bomb, as the visual effects and the plot were lame and out of place, putting in consideration that it was made with over 84 million.Our hero The Mask is best portrayed here in this beautiful movie and it is a keeper. www.lagsreviews.com",The Mask

Stanley Ipkiss is a nice bank clerk but is unable to stand up to anyone and pretty much a pushover to anyone. After the worst night of his life, Stanley's car breaks down on a bridge overlooking the river. As Stanley beats his car he sees something in the water. After retrieving it, he walks home. That night he throws the mask on to his face to scare his dog, Milo (Max) an incredible force overtakes him and his face becomes green. He is overcome with a supernatural power to create things and cause mischief. That night he enacts a little 'revenge' on the mean people of the day including his land lady and car mechanics. But soon Stanley's fun is disturbed when his goofs indirectly lead to the death of small time mob boss Dorian (Peter Greene). Avenge is enacted and Dorian is now out to kill all the gangsters of the city and retrieve this mysterious mask. Along the way Stanley gets help from local beautiful dancer Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz), Max, and Lt. Kellaway (Peter Riegert).The Mask is smart, it's funny, and it's one of Carrey's earliest films and Diaz's first film. The Mask is filled with gags and humorous jokes one of the best being Stanley dancing with Tina and being shot, then accepting an Oscar for portraying the killing. Carrey does good work with Stanley and makes him out to be a total loser with a dog as his only friend. You'll laugh to tears and have a fun time while watching Carrey transform into the mischievous 'Mask Man' and along with Milo once.

But although this movie could have been buried in a shallow and not so interesting story, this one manages to stand out from the rest. Why? First of all, when I saw this one I thought that I was seeing something new. The main title is dazzling, with Randy Edelman's rousing music score (I would give anything to have the cd) filling our ears, and a heavenly theme accompanying the mask in its ascent to the surface. Edge city is a crime-filled place, but manages to be a beautiful sight. Cameron Diaz is a revelation. The humor is out of this world. And when I saw this one as a kid I wished to have that power to be whoever I wanted to. Jim Carrey has in Stanley Ipkiss an even better role than Truman Burbank. The same goes to Cameron Diaz, who is the perfect bombshell. The CGI is also jaw-dropping and eye-popping (literally). I loved all those little touches that made this movie a great ride. And I would love to have that movie score, Randy Edelman: please release a cd!!! A question, however: what the hell happened to the sequel?

The script is fabulous and the management even better. Chuck Russell in his best work gives us a series of unforgettable scenes, it would be impossible to choose one, but among the best could mention: the artistic number of the character of Cameron Diaz in Coco Bongo in the style of Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda"", scene of theft In the bank and the scene in which the Mask gives its deserved to punk-dressed criminals.With regard to the cast, all of them showed off, from the protagonists to the secondary characters. Jim Carrey (The Mask) in his best performance in a comic film, with every gesture, every nonsense, every madness, robs us of laughter from beginning to end. Cameron Diaz (Tina) impeccable in her debut as actress, wasting sensuality and sweetness at the same time, thanks to that majestic body, that blond hair and sky-blue eyes. Peter Greene perfect as a villain, just by looking at that good face and those deep blue eyes and you know who the bad guy is. The cops very awesome, as always the clever (Peter Riegert) and the clumsy (Jim Doughan). And last but not least, I do not know what it's called the dog that made Milo, but what a bonanza, by God, stole the show that little son of a female dog.As a curious fact, the film is based on the eponymous comic. Yes, nobody or almost nobody knows that. But since the film was filmed and because of its wide acceptance by the public, the comic came out of anonymity, one way or another. To finish, in one of the deliveries of the comic, The Mask shares chapters nothing less with the Joker and Batman.",The Mask

Not only is it hilarious and awesome, but its one of my favorite Jim Carrey roles ever!Jim Carrey stars as banker Stanley Ipkiss, who finds a mysterious mask, that when put on turns him into a cartoony, green faced maniac who causes all sorts of mischief. This gets him into some trouble with not only the police, but a gang of mobsters.Funny and entertaining from start to finish. Of course it is Jim Carrey, so that is expected. He has two roles in here: One where he's normal, and then when he has the mask on. Both roles are funny. Cameron Diaz's introducing role as the target of Jim Carrey's affections, who also get involved in a lot of his mischief.Basic comedy with all standard comedy ingredients. Very laugh out loud funny.

If you go into this film wanting to see Carrey act like a Pratt then you will leave happy. However, if you expect some sort of rational story then you will leave not so happily.

But it works in this one. Especially with Jim Carrey as the lead role. I've noticed that Jim Carrey always gets the goofy and crazy roles. It was actually weird seeing him as a sane and normal bank clerk during the beginning of the movie. Regardless, I love Jim Carrey. He's a great actor.This was a pretty good film, considering I don't usually like crazy. The actors were great if you take into account that they're acting in a slapstick sort of comedy. It reminded me of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, actually. Though, I did like this one more. I also thought that the special effects were great for the 90's. Or maybe that's just me.In The Mask, Jim Carrey plays an average bank clerk who one day stumbles upon a mask which allows him to let loose and become crazy.

I was expecting to like it just as much as I remembered, but I didn't. I was pretty disappointed in that fact. I mean, I guess the movie is OK, it's still watchable, but it just leaves a little something to be desired.Jim Carrey is likable enough in his role, and he is entertaining to watch, but the movie just seems a little silly, and not necessarily in a good way. I'd recommend watching it only if you're wanting a mindless little distraction from the burdens of everyday life. If you're looking to find anything of substance here, you're probably going to find this to be a letdown.I'd compare this movie to what it felt like watching episodes of the old 1960s Batman TV show as an adult.

like films and dislike filmsI re-watched it again And found myself tolerating the film most of the time. Instead of enjoying it.To me personally Jim Carrey is one of the most overrated actors out there. I know that he's been there for a long long time and he's considered one of the legends to some people.
But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. And mine is I majority of the time can't stand the actor. his face expressions are very irritating.I disliked the film but I'mma keep it short and only state 3 things that I hated
Jim Carrey is portraying someone who is extremely pathetic and lets people walk over him. Even in the end when he was winning he was pathetic the only part that he wasn't pathetic in is when he wore the mask.The mask is an extreme dangerous weapon anyone who possesses the mask becomes basically a supreme titan. And ipkes have thrown the mask multiple times it's very irritating. And annoying. why not keep the mask to himself. Lock it somewhere if needed he could wear it.

147,BlueSkies765,Jim Carrey IS The Mask,10,2 June 2020,The Mask was made for Jim Carrey. Even though he had some good work before this movie I think he really got popular during the Mask/Ace Ventura era. His cartoonish and expressive style of comedy really stood out. The movie is based on a cartoon and really feels like one too. Anything goes. We're also introduced to other stars like Cameron Diaz. I remember when they would promote this movie they milked the heck out of that shot where she walks into the bank. I would see it everywhere. I think she played the role well as the girlfriend of the bad guy who still feels like a real meanie to this day. It sometimes feels a bit out of place. The very realistic feeling and harsh bad guy in a somewhat cartoonish Universe but I guess the point was to show Stanley is the exact opposite. Peter Greene played the bad guy well.What I really didn't notice when I first watched but now is that the dog Milo was pretty talented. They had him doing all kinds of trick that he did with ease with the right expressions. It was the movie The Mask that made me want to have a dog.One of Jim Carrey's best movies.,The Mask

In particular - Jim Carey nailed his role, and I think it's the best movie he has done (although - I've watched most of his movies, bar a few). I also think that Cameron Diaz did well too. Overall - you know it's a great movie when you can re-watch it, and still greatly enjoy it every time.
Finally - I think this movie deserves more than it has been rated on this site - but I understand that this is a particular style of humour i.e. slapstick. Not everyone will get it or find it funny.",The Mask
149,drawlife,SSSmokin' indeed. Jim Carrey is a comedic tornado.,9,15 November 2014,"This is my favorite Jim Carrey film of all time. I love this film quite a bit. It's fast, it's fun, and it's funny. Stanley Ipkiss(Jim Carrey) is a bank clerk, he's nice guy, that lets everyone stomp all over him, not to mention that he is a hopeless romantic. He stumbles upon an ancient mask that represent the Norse mythology god Loki. Upon wearing the mask he receives superpowers and brings his inner most desires to life. What I love most about this film is that there is a duality between Stanley Ipkiss and the Mask. As Stanley he's shy, timid, mild-mannered, a good guy who gets taken advantage of. But, when he puts on the mask, he's the complete opposite, he's able to become someone he wishes to be: full of wisecracks, jokes, cartoony antics, and full of confidence who chases after Stanley's love interest Tina who is portrayed by Cameron Diaz. I believe this is the film that showcases just how good of an actor Jim Carrey really is. He's able to remain as human as possible, perhaps even a little relatable to some guys as Stanley Ipkiss, but he's able to go off and show off his physical comedy as the Mask. He is literally bringing a cartoon character to life. It's very memorizing. I sincerely believe this is an underrated performance by Jim Carrey. The supporting cast is great. I liked everyone in this film. Peter Riegert is great at Lt. Mitch Kellaway who chases after the Mask, who suspects that the identity of the Mask is Stanley. Peter Greene is great as the villain Dorian, a complete jerk from the beginning. Cameron Diaz is good in her supporting role as the love interest, there is decent chemistry between her and Jim Carrey. Oh and she is also absolutely gorgeous in the film, stunning really. Richard Jeni is also very good as Stanley's best friend at his job. The real supporting character that steals the spotlight is Stanley's dog Milo. A great sidekick and director Chuck Russell puts good use into the dog and actually serves the plot. For 1994, the visuals are impressive and frankly still hold up very well. The disappointing aspect of this film was Amy Yasbeck's character Peggy who is a writer for a newspaper, and a semi-love interest for Stanley. There's a neat twist in the film involving her character, but she abruptly disappears in the film, I already know the behind the scenes story involving her character, but the film doesn't wrap her arc and it's very apparent. The other thing I would have liked to see is the reaction of what the Mask is able to do with his abilities, nobody in the film seems like it's a big deal that he's continuously traveling in a tornado, or able to elongate his body, let alone do everything physically impossible, especially Lt. Kellaway. It doesn't have too much credibility in that department. This film is will always have a special place in my heart, as cheesy as it sounds. The Mask is the first film I watched on VHS. Batman Forever being the first film I ever saw in theaters. Both which stars Jim Carrey. It's really because of Jim and this movie that really got me into films in my youth it opened the doors for me. Green also happens to be my favorite color because he frequently plays characters that are green. What I love about this film is that this film has somewhat of a deeper message. As quoted by Ben Stein who has a role in the film, ""We all wear masks."" Stanley Ipkiss actually wears a mask in the film, he wants to be something else, but he's too afraid and too timid, and the mask provides his desires, eventually he learns to become the man he wants to be and doesn't really need the mask anymore. 9/10",The Mask

But because it came out the same year as Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, Natural Born Killers, The Lion King, New Nightmare, The Crow and True Lies, they were getting all the talk. This movie shouldn't be recognised as the best film of 1994, but the best comedy of its decade. And no, they never made a sequel it doesn't exist (it does, but let's just forget about it, alright?).

151,ingemar-4,Light movie version of a pitch-dark comic,8,24 August 2007,"I first met The Mask as a comic, a violent, even revolting comic. I had to read it is small doses, because the violence was too extreme for my taste.As a movie, it is totally different. That is usually a bad sign, most movies that changes the concept so much fail to tell a good story, but when The Mask gets a less violent script and Carrey's incredible rubber face combined with cartoon-style special effects (and pretty good acting in between), the result is that the humor gets a lot stronger.In the comic, Ipkiss murders his old teacher with a book down her throat, and the car service men are slaughtered in similar ways. In the movie, we see one of the car service guys in pain, but he obviously survives. When the comic Ipkiss slaughters dozens of policemen, the movie version merely teases them. And it is much easier to laugh at.And the movie is great fun. No wonder it made Carrey a superstar. I have seen many of his movies, and this is one of the very best. Other favorites, ""Bruce almighty"" and ""Truman show"" are in many ways logical successors.The original story misuses our Norse god Loki as bad as US people always seem to do. Americans seem to be unable to understand Loki, so they use him as a devil or a demon, which is completely wrong. But the movie is more bent to mischief than slaughter, so the movie makes a big step in the right direction.Something that disturbs me is the bad guy Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) and the plot around him. He is a flat, standard mobster, and his part seems like something that was slapped on because the original ending was too horrible for the movie. But let me also say that the actors do their job well. I just feel that the standard gangster plot feels cheap.So the mobster plot was a disappointment in an otherwise very funny and worthwhile movie.",The Mask

I enjoyed the henchmen, thugs in the park, and the two leaders of the bad guys at loggerheads with each other. The dim witted banter between Doyle and the Lt was not necessary but didn't hurt anything either. The movie as a whole was a worthwhile watch. That said, the true star of the movie is MILO. Every damn scene with him in it was awesome. The scene where he is jumping trying to get to Ipkiss in the jail cell always makes me laugh my ass off. I was always a big dog person who didn't care at all for small dogs until I saw Milo in action.

I hear you screaming from your pews, well, the reason I'm watching right now is that he's tying a balloon into a gun and firing it upon gangsters. It's not just that every shred of humor up until this point has been impotent but the fact Jim Carey's doing it and I'm thinking ""why get the guy who was Ace Ventura and try to put a mask on him? Was this Jim's ideal? Liar liar has me thinking maybe he likes doing these kind of movies, if it's for fun then good for him, if- oh look the movies over! What happened? I don't know I wasn't paying attention, I think maybe the blonde girl was vapid or using the loser for her own interests or something, some more silly looney-tune rubbish ensued and Jim Carrey gets paid. Then he's fished by some dimwit for another soulless comedy vehicle, draining his soul just a lil more until one day he has to do a decent film and redeem himself in his own eyes, lest he stick his head in the oven from shame. Why do I hate this movie so much? It almost made me hate, HATE, Jim Carey. I was bored of him for a portion of my young life, and that's not right. Copy and paste into Mr Poppers Penguins.In short, skip this one.",The Mask

163,MoviesReviews101,Verdict: Strong comedy,8,20 November 2014,"Story: The Mask starts by taking us to the Edge City where all the action will take place. We see the Mask released from its locked up underwater treasure chest, we then get to meet our protagonist Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey). Stanley is a lonely banker who gets walked all over by his co-workers along with people taking advantage of him during his daily life. When his bad day continues to get worse he finds a mask that transforms him into a charismatic mad man. After the Mask character gets involved in a bank robbery he ends up making enemies with the criminal minds in the town putting Stanley's life in danger. Stanley must learn to measure his new found confidence gained from the mask to save the girl and clear his name. The Mask makes for a great comic book story, it plays on the very simple ideas of not having enough confidence until you can become someone else. It also looks to follow very simple save the girl from villain story, easy to work with and makes for an overall entertaining idea. The Mask doesn't try to throw any twists in the story keeping it easy to follow. It really comes off as a simple comic book story that can be followed and enjoyed by all. (8/10)Actor ReviewJim Carrey: Stanley Ipkiss/The Mask as Stanley he is quiet laid back banker, who lets people walk all over him. After he puts on The Mask he becomes a mad man with no fear. Jim does a great job balancing the two characters with ease and being able to bounce between them with a blink of an eye. (9/10)Cameron Diaz: Tina Carlyle beautiful woman who approaches Stanley in the bank but her motives are not what they seem. She becomes a romantic interest for Stanley. Cameron makes her debut in film here and does a good job in the damsel in distress role. (7/10)Peter Greene: Dorian criminal that The Mask gets involved with after losing his long planed out bank job. He wants to the power of the mask but soon shows the darker side inside him. Peter does a good job as the villain but never offers anything we haven't seen before. (7/10)Support Cast: The Mask's supporting cast is henchmen, police officers and a friend of Stanley's. They all play their part to offer a few laughs for The Mask character.Director Review: Chuck Russell – Chuck does a good job directing this fun comedy film. (7/10)Comedy: The Mask offers plenty of laughs, with Carrey being the main cast member offering them.

164,Ryan_9,Fun and enjoyable,8,21 July 2020,"I liked ""The Mask."" Jim Carrey (Stanley Ipkiss) did a great job and was hilarious under The Mask persona. I liked how he played both a human character and a cartoon one. It shows how great of an actor he is with being able to go from playing an average, shy, and hopeless romantic to the complete opposite of that. I loved the dialogue especially when he said, ""Look ma, I'm roadkill!"" That line and the balloon animal scene had me cracking up. I also loved his rendition of ""Cuban Pete"" with the cops. Cameron Diaz (Tina Carlyle) was so hot in this and I loved the dancing scene between the two as it was very entertaining. I liked Tina and thought she was a good character.If they gave out awards to animals then, Milo would've certainly won a few because he was an excellent dog and performed so well. It's ironic how the MacGuffin in this film is a mask when in today's world masks are a large factor in deciding how society runs. Although, I think a mask that gives you superpowers is something everyone could use right now. Obviously, I mean that for good reasons.Overall, I'll give ""The Mask"" an 8/10. A fun movie that has something for everyone to enjoy.",The Mask
165,kikoydaba3,a comedic classic for its irreverent humor and surprisingly awesome visuals,5,3 September 2019,"Despite a poorly constructed story, The Mask remains a comedic classic for its irreverent humor and surprisingly awesome visuals. Jim Carrey's perfect slapstick comedy cannot save a paper thin narrative and characterization. Cameron Diaz, in her first film appearance, stands alongside Carrey albeit being overshadowed, cementing herself as a sex symbol with a juicy performance. The motivations of the characters are not properly fleshed out for a satisfying conclusion. Having a weak antagonist also does not help.The Mask can't be called a waste because the comedy is stupidly great, especially the police dancing sequence and Looney Tunes references, making the film essentially a live-action derivative of the iconic cartoon characters. However, as a satisfying film with great characters and story it drops the ball.5/10",The Mask
166,tobydale,A deeply flawed film - which children should not see.,6,12 April 2011,"I first saw this movie when it came out. It was hyped and it delivered - I enjoyed it. For it's time it had a lot of very good special effects. It left us with the immortal ""Smokin'""! and ""Somebody stop me""!Carrey is average as the nerky bank clerk, but as The Mask Carrey is terrific and very funny.Over the years I've grown to regard The Mask as a kids' film - but here's the big problem; The Mask is most definitely not a children's film!!!I sat down and properly watched The Mask for the first time in years and was really quite surprised and disappointed at what I saw; It's very violent. For example; The Mask/Ipkiss (a good guy????) goes for revenge on the garage workers who humiliate him, and one character is hospitalised with an exhaust pipe clearly stuck up his rectum. He then goes on to rob a bank! There is some pretty ripe language - short of swearing, but only just! Pretty much all of the adults, including The Mask/Ipkiss, are BAD role-models who do pretty bad things to each other. The comic-like setting is not comic like enough, and children will only see the nastiness, not the irony.So - Despite its billing, The Mask is not a kids film. What does it offer adults then?Well, there's Cameron Diaz, who is very easy on the eye, reminiscent of Jessica Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). In fact Diaz even strikes very similar poses to Jessica, probably deliberately. She does quite well with a silly character and script, a very good first outing in a big movie for her.But that's about it! There's nothing of substance here for adult viewers. The film is cartoon like on all levels; The story is weak, dialogue silly and infantile. The setting - ""Edge City"" might as well be New York, don't know why they called it Edge City. There's lots of pointless stuff like this, which isn't funny. Also not funny is the epi-centre of the film; The CoCo Club - which is guarded by nasty bent thugs and in spite of the glamorous dressy people outside all fighting to get in is not a place to aspire to. Not good for any children watching, not good at all. Worse still - the ""Hero"" Ipkiss/The Mask is desperate to gain entry in order to chase after Diaz. Not somewhere a Hero should be looking to go - not something children looking for a ""Hero"" or adult role-model in general should see.There are lots of bad guys, bad guys working for bad guys, working for bad guys - and they all smoke! Even Diaz works for a bad guy - which makes her a bad guy too. The cops are silly and seen to be so. Then there's The Mask who seems to be a good guy but is a bad guy quite a lot of the time. He takes the Mickey out of the bad guys, but then he robs the Bank that his alter ego Ipkiss works in! The Mask packs lots of weapons too and in one scene uses a 'balloon' machine gun to shoot up a knife gang which come after him to try and mug him. Not for children! Sure - The Mask is funny - but he is NOT a classic goodie, not a ""Hero"".There are plenty of scenes with overt violence which are much too strong for children under the age of 11-12. The worst one is the huge shoot up at the Club near the end; there is plenty of blood, plenty of holes in chests. Not good for children, not good at all!So - this film fails to be kids classic, which is really what it should have been. It fails to entertain adults on anything more than a simplistic level. I've given it 6 because Carrey is excellent as ""The Mask"". The film very occasionally shows the viewer the humour in what it might be like if you could really do what your inner self tells you you should do. But so what?",The Mask
167,JoshSharpe,Mindlessly silly but not very funny,5,29 August 2012,"""You gotta ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya?"" The answer is: not really. At least, I could have felt a lot luckier if this film was a lot better. Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a nice guy who can't stick up for himself. One day, he finds a mask that transforms him into the man that he wants to be but doesn't have the courage to do so. The mask even makes his crush fall for him. Although this all may sound creative, which to me it does, this movie was disappointing. I expected more from Jim Carrey and despite being amusing at times, it should've and could've been a lot funnier. There were only a few scenes when I genuinely laughed and when you have Jim Carrey in a comedic role with a story as wacky and creative as this one, it is no doubt there should be more.",The Mask

171,miroslavhradel,A timeless classic,10,25 February 2021,"The Mask was one of my instant favorites when I first saw the movie in the late 1990s, and watching it for the first time in six or seven years made me realize what a timeless classic it has become.There are virtually all the ingredients that make a good comedy movie. The plot proves to be both original and entertaining from the beginning to the end. The foolish and cartoonish nature of the movie's characters, especially the bad guys and the cops, is understandable when one considers the fact that The Mask was based on a comic book, and it does happen to be a trope that makes a significant contribution to the high comedic value of the motion picture.The special effects are even more impressive now that the movie is almost thirty years old. The Mask feels modern in many other aspects as well. Not only it is miles ahead of the numerous unimaginative and forgettable flicks that were added to the comedy and fantasy genres in recent years, but it also has the ability to emphasize how bland they are.Jim Carrey delivers a solid performance as the star of the movie and almost single-handedly keeps the story on course. Peter Riegert and Cameron Diaz in her debut role turn out to be the most consistent performers in the supporting cast, with the remainder of its members delivering relatively unspectacular performances and so giving the movie its only blatant flaw.",The Mask
172,schmimic,Jim Carrey stars in this somewhat amusing flick that is reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons.,6,23 April 2005,"Starring: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Greene So, you should have been tipped off by the fact that this movie stars Jim Carrey that it's not really high on the intellectual scale plot-wise. Sure, it's amusing, but it gets less amusing as you get older. Fortunately my maturity level seldom increases dramatically, so I can unashamedly say that I do like this movie. It's just not great by any stretch.Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) is a low-key quiet banker who keeps to himself for the most part, watches cartoons, and is a doormat for the general public. Then one night Stanley thinks he sees a body floating in the water beside a bridge, only when he gets to it he finds that there is no actual body. He does, however, find an interesting mask. A green mask made of wood. So he takes it home, not thinking too much of it.Then when he's home, he goes to try the mask on, only to find that it's more than a piece of wood. It sucks onto his face, leeches onto his personality, and brings out the wild side of Stanley Ipkiss that nobody ever thought existed. His character is not unlike watching a Saturday morning cartoon as far as the antics he gets into.Then when Stanley is The Mask he commits a few crimes, like robbing the bank he works at, vandalizing his auto repair shop, stuff like that. The police start looking for him and figure out that The Mask and Stanley are one and the same. Eventually a crime lord kind of guy finds Stanley and takes the mask from him, and it turns him into a very powerful, very evil being, capable of practically anything. Then of course Stanley has to stop him, blah blah blah, and that's about it plotwise.Like I said before, it's hardly an intellectual movie. It's semi-amusing and worth at least one watch, provided you don't have to pay more than three or four dollars to do so.Bottom line: 2.5 out of 4 (maybe a renter)",The Mask

The Mask is a classic comedy and for 25 years old, it still holds up to this very day.The movie is about an average guy, Stanley Ipkiss (played by Jim Carrey) and he is living a mediocre life as a banker and being swept under the rug. One night, he comes across a legendary mask that, when he puts on, turns him into a full blown crazy and wacky guy. Stanley uses these powers to hit on a hot chick, Tina (played by Cameron Diaz) and to stop this mob group from robbing and later wanting to kill Tina.Everything about this movie was great. The dialogue and quotes from Carrey were funny and clever, the special effects were impressive, and pacing was fast and great.Also, this is Cameron Diaz's first movie, and I gotta say, she did a wonderful job as playing the love interest. Her character was likable, sweet, and there was great chemistry with her and Carrey on screen.Jim Carrey's dog, Milo, was also lovable and funny and was a terrific sidekick.Overall, I love The Mask.

The film really being the perfect setup for Jim Carrey's comedy styling's. The plot follows Stanley Ipkiss, a typical working scrub. Who finds a Mask which turns him into a egotistical Cartoon character essentially. Who causes the ire of the local gangster. Jim Carrey leads the film fantastically, the zany nature of the story and his acting give the a comic book feel, giving it a timeless quality. The humour at times being very childlike, but at times having a real edge to it. The villain Dorian Tyrell played by Peter Greene is quite a ridiculous character in a lot of ways, with so many poor henchmen around him. But Greene does some how get over this and makes him pretty intimidating. The film also has Cameron Diaz possibly at her sexiest with a great entrance in to the movie, and Milo the dog contending with Carrey with some very funny moments. Things i did not quite like were the attempts at comedy involving the cops. I did like Peter Riegert cynical detective, but his inept partner was just plain annoying.A great film to take you back to your childhood and remind you how funny Jim Carrey can be.",The Mask

179,wile_E2005,"""...Jimmy, a Mask named Jim Carrey!""",10,27 November 2008,"This film is a cult classic. Those six words are enough to describe the movie itself from my view.I never really got into it when I was younger (maybe cause I never SAW it!) But then early this year, since I am a HUGE cartoon fan, I decided to check it out. And boy, did I miss out on a lot of fun, which I was finally able to be part of! For starters, THIS is the film where Jim Carrey's zany/goofy antics are absolutely perfect and in time with the movie he is starring in. This movie even made me like Jim Carrey a bit more (I previously saw him in ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" which was actually kinda good IMO). And it gave me my first glimpse of Cameron Diaz, which was appropriate since it was her debut film role as the beautiful miss Tina Carlyle. And was she ever sexy! Combine the Girl of ""Red Hot Riding Hood,"" Jessica Rabbit, and Daphne from ""Scooby-Doo,"" and you've got a great character with a great actress! Ben Stein was also great, too. I get a kick out of hearing his ""boring"" voice! The plot is one I can identify with. A social misfit that loves cartoons... almost kinda like ME! (Though I'm a bit more socially successful than Stanley Ipkiss was). And after a terrible day, he finds the ancient mask that transforms him into... THE MASK! From here on, it's classic cartoon bouncy/zany stuff whenever The Mask is lurking! Unfortunately, he is only the Mask for 30 minutes of the film, maybe because this was produced in 1994 and they didn't want to blow a lot of money with extensive use of CGI animation (Remember, CGI was state-of-the-art for its time back in 1994!) The Mask is able to whirl like the Tasmanian Devil, seduce like a Pepe Le Pew clone, carry many things up his sleeve, and just put a smile on your face.The Mask's cartoony antics are very similar to (and reminiscent of) some of the great super-cartoony classics, such as the Tex Avery cartoons, some of Bob Clampett's best works, and ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo!"" (Great show, BTW!) The CGI animation is state-of-the-art for its time (Shame this film didn't win the Oscar for best special effects!) Some of my favorite bits include the lines ""It's party time! P-A-R-T... Y? Because I GOTTA!"" and ""I believe my friends are (on the guest list for the Coco Bongo club), perhaps you know them... Franklin, Grant and Jackson!"" and ""Let's ROCK THIS JOINT!"" I also loved it when The Mask squeezed that little horn at the car, but the horn lets out a long verbal ""AAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGAH!"" as loud as a Chrysler air raid siren, as well as when he is asked by a punk if he's got the time, The Mask gets out a ticking clock and says ""Look at THAT! It's exactly two seconds before I honk your nose and pull your underwear over your head!"" This then results in The Mask's first wedgie! And his little balloon animal show... ""For you sir... a French Poodle!"" *BANG! Sputter...* ""Sorry son, the dog was rabid, had to put it down!"" And what about the Hey Pachuco musical number, and The Mask's ""Oscar-winning performance"" (complete with an animated applauding audience silhouette!) Personally, my all-time favorite part in this movie is when The Mask goes to the Coco Bongo nightclub, and among seeing the sexy Tina Carlyle, he bugs his eyes out, unfurls his tongue on the ground, pounds his heart through his chest, and then he MORPHS INTO A 'TOON WOLF AND HOWLS AT HER, THEN WOLF-WHISTLES AND BANGS HIS HEAD WITH A MALLET! That wolf scene is a thousand times better than any werewolf transformation I have ever seen on film! Whew... glad I got all that out. Anyways, one of the best movies ever made.

181,ninjagaiden007,Jim Carrey at his best.,10,6 January 2007,"never thought it could happen. Jim Carrey (star of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) upstaged -- and not once, but twice! While it's true that The Mask is another vehicle for the rubber-featured modern-day amalgamation of Jerry Lewis and the Three Stooges, this time around Carrey has some competition, and there are a number of scenes where he ends up playing second fiddle.The special effects are, for the most part, rather impressive, but they're as frequently guilty of overwhelming the star's performance as complimenting it. Nevertheless, if you think Carrey has an expressive face, wait 'til you see him with the mask on. Eyes pop out and jaws drop -- literally. ILM goes to work with their own version of live-action animation whenever anyone dons the mask. Good costumes and make-up serve only to enhance the computer-generated visuals.And, even as the audience's attention is arrested by the work of the effects wizards, there's still room for a canine scene-stealer. Milo (whose real name is Max) is the perfect foil for Carrey's goofiness and -- yes -- there are occasions where his animal antics divert the spotlight away from his two-legged co-star.Carrey, meanwhile, is playing a split role: mild-mannered Stanley Ipkiss and his superhuman alter-ego, the Mask. Stanley is a shy, unassuming man who works in a bank and lives with Milo in a small apartment. One day, following a terrible bout with Murphy's Law, Stanley finds a curious-looking mask floating amidst some debris in a river. Later, at home, when he finally gets around to trying the mask on, Stanley learns that this isn't some archaeological curiosity. It has power - the power to transform. From the moment the mask clings to his skin and his face turns green, Stanley's personality undergoes a radical shift. Insecurity is replaced by flamboyance. Physically, there seems to be little that he can't do, from twisting his body into a pretzel to taking a bullet in the chest or forming a tommy gun out of a balloon.While wearing the mask, Stanley makes a comment about becoming a superhero, but he's really interested in one thing: Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz), a voluptuous nightclub singer who works for a local gangster (Peter Greene). Following a bank robbery (to finance his wooing), the Mask discovers that a cop, Lt. Mitch Kellaway (Peter Riegert), is hot on his trail. And it's not that difficult a trail to follow. After all, how many lime-faced bandits are there who move like the Warner Brothers cartoon Tasmanian Devil? Carrey plays Stanley with surprising restraint, giving his zaniness free reign only when the mask is on. In some ways, it's a Clark Kent/Superman thing. Stanley and the Mask might share the same body, but they're very different. One is a typical nice guy who finishes last. The other is Robin Williams' genie from Aladdin come to life (Carrey provides dozens of whirlwind impersonations).As a comedy, The Mask is genial, but its recycled plot is far too thin for the film to succeed as either an adventure or a spoof. ""Comic book"" and ""cartoon"" are two terms that come to mind for describing this movie. Neither is intended to be pejorative, but each conjures certain apt images.Carrey is only in The Mask for 25-30 mins. I wanted to see more. But it's good to see his serious stuff as well.For me, Ace Ventura was too much concentrated Jim Carrey. In The Mask, the forceful personality is diluted. The star is mostly-subdued except during those off-the-wall bursts of energy that accompany the appearance of the Mask. The film is entertaining enough -- in a light, undemanding sort of way -- but more than the combined efforts of Carrey, ILM, and Max are demanded to camouflage the seams and holes still apparent in this production. No one else could have played the part better.",The Mask

It is about a nerdy guy named Stanley Ipkiss who works as a banker and loves his dog named Milo. Then one night he finds an ancient mask derived from Loki (Greek god of mischief) that brings his innermost desires to life and turns him into a wisecracking green superhero that's basically a real-life cartoon character before our very eyes. This movie has everything from groundbreaking special effects, references to cartoon characters such as Tazz (when he puts on the mask, he spins around like a tornado), the Roadrunner (he dashes) Tex Avery cartoons, a great climax, and blonde bombshell Cameron Diaz (her first film role). This is a movie that I have, and if you like Jim Carrey, go out and buy it. I have watched it several times, and if you haven't seen it yet, please do.

184,alfCycle,Still fun after all these years,8,7 June 2017,"I loved this movie as a kid in the 90s. I couldn't say how many times I've seen it. A safe bet would probably be more than 20. However, I hadn't watched it in about 15-20 years. There are lots of movies I loved as a kid that don't hold up too well when viewed as an adult. This one is still a whole lot of fun to watch even today. Surprisingly, the special effects are still pretty damn good. I've watched some 90s movies more recently where the special effects looked awful and distracting by today's standards. I can't say there was any particular scene in The Mask where I thought the effects were noticeably lacking. This movie does not take itself too seriously. It is basically a live action Looney Tunes cartoon. This could easily come across as obnoxious and dumb, but this film really pulls it off in the best possible way. Jim Carrey was perfect for this role. I can't imagine anyone else as The Mask. I also loved the use of music in the film. The song and dance numbers are highly entertaining. Overall, The Mask is just a really fun movie and anyone that enjoys those old Looney Tunes cartoons should have a good time watching.8/10************SPOILERS************Recommended for those that enjoy looney tunes super powers, really smart dogs, nice guys that can't catch a break, bumbling cops, douchebag gangster villains, 90s henchmen, condom jokes that go over kids heads, sexual innuendo, breaking the fourth wall, atomic wedgies, anally intrusive consumer feedback, swinging dance numbers, conga lines, ass biting, head p*ssing, bomb swallowing......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: 10+",The Mask

The effects were just amazing, Jim Carrey's performance was amazing and he always made you laugh and this film is my number one film of all time. I can't stop watching this film even to this day, if you want to have a laugh or want to see a great comedian at work then this is the film for you (I know it's mine). One of my favourite scenes of this movie is when he goes up against the bad guys and pretends to be shot as the Mask, Stanley Ipkiss is such a sweet and awesome character. It's one of Jim Carrey's finest films and I recommend it to anybody. I give this film a 10/10 and it's SMOKINNNNNNNNN.",The Mask
192,mikestollov,Like Looney Tunes Cartoons Brought To Life,10,20 November 2002,"When you get someone like Jim Carey it's often hard to find a vehicle that's suited to their talents. No such problem here, with the manic, hyper energetic comedian fitting the role with utter ease. It was as if the whole idea was written with him in mind.Actually it's more likely that someone sat down one day & decided to see just how far they could push the new digital special effects of the day. Whatever, the results are pure lunacy.Carey, as mild mannered, down trodden Stanley Ipkiss is a bubbling pot of seething desires & emotions ready to boil over but forever with the lid firmly clamped down. He plays the part supremely, not overly sentimental (something of an achievement in today's Hollywood!) & always giving an air of the raging spirit within that is just itching to get out. It's like watching someone walk a tightrope.Jim Carey as The Mask is something of a whirlwind, quite literally. Who can forget the two stand out lines when the Mask takes over; ""Somebody stop me!"" & ""Smokin'!"". These two lines sum the character up in a marvelous way.His dog, Milo, is also well done. How on earth some Hollywood exec didn't insist that it become some sentimental pooch I'll never know. Yes it is far too intelligent, far too useful, far too convenient, but it is excusable in the context of the film.The marginal story line about gansters, a bank heist & so on is merely a framework for Carey as the Mask to perform increasingly manic acrobatics on the screen. The references to cartoons, especially Wiley Coyote & Road Runner (perhaps the best, most imaginative cartoons ever made) are obvious. There is even a direct steal from a Bugs Bunny cartoon where it appears that the audience has stood up in front of you to applaud a performance as Carey gets handed an Oscar.The cops & the villains are all about as dumb as each other, which is the reasons why they're there. Carey as the Mask is the focus of all this, after all. Peter Riegert as Lt Kellaway & Peter Greene as the villanous Dorian Tyrell do the job well though & Tyrell even gets a shot at wearing the Mask with somewhat muted results. Let's face it, nothing compares to Carey's version.The pace wanes a little towards the end, but still contains an interesting twist, where the love lorn Carey discovers the truth about Amy Yasbeck's reporter & Cameron's Diaz's night club singer. It is  not what you'd expect. There are also some surprisingly good musical numbers, I bet that took some explaining in the studio board meetings!All in all a good laugh & the mark of this film is that several years later, after watching at least 3 times since release, a recent TV showing still made me laugh again.There'll never be another, perhaps that's as well as I doubt that the material would be so forthcoming, although it's a shame there won't be another helping of The Mask.",The Mask

194,moviemonster92,"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""The Mask""",6,17 August 2006,"Jim Carrey is one my favorite actors of all time. He is great and very funny and has made a lot of great films and career choices. One of them was The Mask. It is one of the movies that got Carrey started in the acting business. The plot is simple and outlandish. Stanley Ipkiss is a too nice pushover bank clerk in Edge City. After one of the worst days of his life he comes across a mysterious mask, owned by Loki, the God of Mischief. So now when he puts on the mask, he becomes a crazy romantic. When he starts to fall for the girlfriend of the local mob boss (Cameron Diaz, in one of her first roles). The mob finds out about the ancient mask and are out to find it. The group, which is led by Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene). So Stanley has to save the day and get the girl. The acting and visual effect are all very well done and probably some of the greatest at the time. Jim Carrey heads the movie very well with supporting help from Cameron Diaz and Amy Yasbeck. All in all, a great comedic classic that should go down into visual effects history.3 out of 4 stars",The Mask
195,d4rk3v1L,excellent comedy of 1994,9,11 June 2005,"""The Mask"" it is a movie that causes to see and to see as many times as be necessary to stay happy, it is that Jim Carrey is excellent comic actor, and its performance in this movie, like in the other comic movie of 1994 (Dumb and Dumber) they have taken it to the fame that today in day has. Other comic movies as ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" they are others that should be in our collection of comic classics, and as an user he/she said somewhere around in their comment: ""1994, year of good movies"", ""1994 Jim Carrey's year"", I say that he's right, and I hope that the stupid sequels that ruin the original spirit of the movies like ""Son of the Mask"" they stop to be carried out. P.S. Another attraction of this movie is Tina (Cameron Díaz), first movie where I see it, and that it is its sensual stereotype that has not had in other movies (perhaps in ""The Sweetest Thing"").",The Mask
196,L_Garou,It really is a spicy meatball!,8,17 January 2021,A spicy little classic is what it is. Super funny because of Jim.

197,bryanplateado,One crazy movie with a lot of funny moments!,9,22 October 2020,"The Mask is a 1994 comedy and slapstick movie starring Jim Carrey. It is about Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey), a bank clerk, who lets people push him around and never stands up for himself. One night he finds a mask, and whenever he puts it on he becomes a crazy wild man. The Mask is a great movie that has so many good things about it. Jim Carrey gives a great performance as both Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask. Him as Stanley Ipkiss was pretty funny because he makes everything weird and awkward, which is funny, and when he becomes The Mask, it's one of the craziest and funniest scenes you will see. Jim Carrey has really good chemistry with Cameron Diaz as well. Cameron Diaz gives a really good performance in this movie considering the fact that this was her first movie ever. I really like all the characters in this movie and everyone gives a really good performance as well. Chuck Russell did a really good job directing this movie, and the screenplay written by Mike Werb was also very good. The special effects, in my opinion, still hold up to this day. They are still really good and really cool to look at. The comedy and slapstick is utilized very well in the movie, and that's mostly from Jim Carrey, and it's hard to think that Jim Carrey wasn't even the first choice for Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask. The studio's first choice for the role of Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask was Matthew Broderick, so they were considering him for the role. There were other actors considered for the role, but Jim Carrey was the best choice for the role. My only issue with the movie is the tone. It doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. The movie can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or a darker kind of movie. I know the movie is based on comic books, and the comic books are very dark and brutal, but they did decide to change that for the movie and go a more friendly way, so I can't really give the movie a pass for that, but that's my only issue with the movie. The Mask is an awesome movie with great performances, great special effects, a really funny screenplay, and the movie is just very entertaining. It may not have a consistent tone, but the movie is still very good. If you haven't seen The Mask yet, go and watch it, it's really good.",The Mask

It got something really important: all movie elements. You know; such as love, drama, humor (especially), action. But not horror, thinking about it... Anyway; if you haven't seen this movie, you should.

It represents the hidden fantasies of each of us and we possess powers that make us physically invincible, resilient, immune to bullets, superhuman speed and strength and freedom to do whatever we want, without fear of reprisal or police rules state etc ... in a nutshell winners, a world where we do not close the doors of the best club in town for being a nobody like the good Ipkiss, having the most hot girl, the best table, spread tickets like candy at a Christmas parade, in short, be the mambo Kings, as they say.The visual effects, even today are still very good, being deservedly nominated for an Oscar and other awards in that category.It also highlights the very successful and catchy songs like Coco Bongo Pachuco ¨ or ¨ Cuban Pete, police soundtrack.Nothing more to say about a film that won her debut year and has already become a cult film and fondly remembered for those lucky enough to live intensely the last decade of the 90s.",The Mask

If you've seen a Jim Carrey movie you know his style, he tends to overdo a little sometimes but he manages to stay funny, a lot of people don't like him because of all the weird stuff he throws in while acting, but this movie can change some minds about Carrey. The Mask follows the story of Stanley Ipkins, an average guy who finds an ancient Scandinavian mask, it contains within the Norse god Loki banished and imprisoned, now whoever puts on the mask gets possesses by the joker spirit of the god gaining incredible powers and the will to cause problems.In The Mask Carrey plays two characters, one is the more-than-regular Stanley Ipkins, who's a shy fan of cartoons and works at a bank, he's not good with the ladies and the world seems to conspire against him at all costs, luck sure doesn't seem to enjoy playing on the side of Ipkins at all. The other is when he puts on the mask and transforms himself into a green-masked party-boy maniac, ready to joke all around town, all his romantic repression is unleashed and he starts acting in a cartoony style much like the cartoons he enjoys so much seeing. There are funny scenes all around but the highlights are when Carrey puts on the mask, including dance scenes; one is particularly funny because it has a cover music track of Cuban Pete sang by Carrey himself, seems like the song was destined to be funny. The movie also features the debut of Cameron Diaz when she actually looked cute and not a super-sized barbie doll.If you like Carrey you really should see this movie because it's one of the best stuff Carrey ever pulled.

213,barleeku,"A brilliant, wild ride",10,21 April 2005,"This is one of the most exuberant, wild comedies ever, with Jim Carrey turning in one of the most absolute comic performances ever seen on screen. Sure, there's the make-up to help him along, but it's all nothing without his incredible body language (yeah, I know he doesn't really hop around like that) and his Carrey-esquire ability to push each gesture to the limit without violating the viewer's confidence in Carrey's underlying intelligence. Cameron Diaz's entrance must be one of the most amazing film debuts in history and, being a terrific actress anyway, she sustains the impact throughout. The supporting cast is great,especially Peter Greene in the critical role of Dorian, Nancy Fish as Carrey's landlady, and Richard Jeni as Stanley's buddy. What really elevates this film beyond simply being a great star-vehicle is - well, actually, a few things. The sets are suggestive of ""Edge City"" - the name of the city in the movie - but nothing like the wasteland of Robocop or the Gothic urban-scapes of Batman. Sometimes, understatement works better - the movie has a comic book element to it, of course, but the sets themselves, while hinting at a sinister zeitgeist, don't fall into comic book sensibility. But the element that raises this to a 10, for me, is that it's simply a very well-told story with a great script. It's filmed tight, things make sense emotionally, the pacing is varied and compelling, and one cares about Stanley (Carrey) and Tina (Diaz) from the beginning of the movie. I am surprised at the rating this film receives from IMDb'ers - I would have thought it'd be higher. But maybe it's because recent first-time viewers are used to Carrey and Cameron, and even the tone of the movie itself. I saw it when it came out with one of my kids, and have watched it numerous times thereafter with them - and by myself as well. Catching 10 minutes of it on TV is still a treat some nights.

He works in a bank, has trouble talking to girls and watches cartoons before going to sleep. All this changes one night when he finds an ancient mask in the sea. From curiosity, he tries on the mask and BAM! one of the greatest monsters from the 90's is born. Now with a green face and a goofy yellow suit, the mask heads out to the city to live the good life. His pockets loaded with ridiculous gadgets and his mouth filled with cheesy one liners.The Mask is a lot of fun to watch. Rarely does a movie take you to such an unusual situation and makes it relateable to the audience. Jim Carrey executes his role with comedic perfection. His voice, movements and expressions almost make it seem as if he had once upon a time been a maniac with the green face. The other actress that needs a mentioning is Cameron Diaz, making her debut as one of the sexiest women of all time. She brings all the boys out their seats and makes all the women jealous. Don't be surprise if you keep coming back to see this movie just because of her.I recommend this movie to those who are looking for a fun time.

This brilliant script has everything, 1940's gangster movie suspense, silent film slapstick, and classic Looney Tunes inspired antics all thrown into a blender. The CGI effects, make-up, and costumes are all fantastic, but what is also amazing is that Jim Carrey is pretty much playing two separate characters in the same movie. He does his usual wacky shtick as The Mask but he also plays a sympathetic hero as Stanley Ipkiss. The beautiful music is just icing on the cake. Without a doubt, The Mask is a comedic masterpiece.

The rubbery, one-of-a-kind effects, stylish art deco setting and vintage comic book vibrance create a terrific atmosphere, and the fact that it's all played so straight might be why it works as well as it does. Peter Riegert's Dt. Kelloway, Peter Greene's Dorian Tyrell and the rest of the mobsters never seem like they'd be out of place in a ""serious"" '90s crime drama, so seeing them all get caught up in the Mask's cartoonish exploits is a sight to behold.The excellent supporting cast, including the late, great Richard Jeni, Cameron Diaz' debut performance, Ben Stein at his deadpan best and the superbly emotive dog Milo round out every scene with something great. At the end of the day, the film is, of course, Jim Carrey's, and his stunning comic antics as the Mask are surprisingly rivaled by his Stanley Ipkiss. It's a role he fills with one compelling touch after another, each subtle expression as impressive as his wildest face-pulls. The earnestness with which he embodies what so many of us frequently feel like - a nice guy just desperate to unleash their inner Jim Carrey - is perhaps The Mask's most impressive spectacle.",The Mask
219,punyerd,Nothing like The Mask,3,23 January 2021,"Nothing like The Mask at all. This Mask is a hero, not an extremely scary and brutal psychopath. Jim Carrey would have been a great actor to play the ACTUAL Mask, but he makes him goofy and comedic. The Mask is put to shame with this. There isn't even a Kathy Matthews, Mitch Kellaway doesn't do much, and Stanley doesn't turn into a psychopath as soon as he puts the Mask on. And he doesn't die at the end. Knock off.

221,jryndon,Hero in a Mask? I,8,22 July 2015,"The hero, stanley epcis, hope I spelled that right, is a banker. He is quite a cartoon fan with a dog, which I believe is the most adorable, bright creature I've ever seen. Then he met this woman and the story starts to run.Its basically it. But what made this a good view is its comical ways and I meant it to be both figuratively and literally. Jim Carrey takes up the figurative part. I think he is the best in this regard, for what I've seen so far in years, ever. The Literal part will be about the effects and animation and it is impressive. To make guns move so real but you know it doesn't spin like that in reality, and that is the amazing part, considering the time in its production.The ending, you will find it predictable but the story though important, not quite the only factor that makes this good. Though there is a sudden twist in it. The good was stupid and turned out bad and the beautiful and enemy turned out a trusted ally.The hoola, hoo, holla! was the best of my watch. The choreography with exaggerated movements we know Jim Carry carry out so well was superb. The coco bango, yah! Well, this isn't turning out to be a good, intelligent review. Let's resume then...The music and dance routines. There were many of them. Quite the jiggle and before you'd know it, a smile is painted in your lips and laugh out loud. It is super comical and unreal, and it's obvious this would never happen even if it was the common reaction of talking and walking, but it is part of the goodness of the movie.Obviously, I've enjoyed the movie, of re-watch and year 2015. But I can't say its humor would appeal to the people today. No need to say that this kind of things evolve along with everything else. Maybe, perhaps, but to my believe, more likely.",The Mask
222,Wilson102,One of the best comedies from the funniest guy in Hollywood,9,10 September 2009,"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was really the movie that put Jim Carrey on the map. The Mask is the movie that solidified his position as the funniest guy in Hollywood. In The Mask Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss the nice guy who always finishes last. He gets a hold of a mask that once he wears it his innermost desires come to life. Will Stanley let the mask rule his life or will he realize he's great just the way he is. You'll just have to watch the movie to find out. Jim Carrey gave an awesome performance in this movie. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a musical or comedy. He didn't win it, but his performance was definitely good enough to have one it. Ipkiss is in no way Ace Ventura. He isn't the confident wild man that Ace is. He's the nice guy that finishes last that everyone likes. Carrey plays it to perfection. Once the Mask is put on Carrey becomes that wild man that we love so much and thats where the movie really excels. The animation they used for Ipkiss with the mask on is great and Carrey plays the wild man better than anyone ever. He sings, dances, and throws out some of the best one liners ever. Stanley Ipkiss is a great character and thanks to Jim Carrey for making him that. Cameron Diaz is great in the film. This was the movie that introduced us to the formere model. She holds her own real well in the movie. Carrey was so hot when he did this movie riding the success of Pet Detective and she shines in this role. She is absolutely gorgeous throughout the whole film. She's not a bad actress and I really wish she'd do more roles like this. The extras on the DVD are decent. There are some deleted scenes that are alright and the directors commentary is decent as well. The movie can be viewed in full or widescreen format and it features dolby digital sound. I wish they'd done some more with the special features though. They could have done something cool with the music or special effects, but they didn't. The music is great in this film. I have the soundtrack as well and the music helps make this film great. Jim Carrey is great when he dances and sings in ""Cuban Pete."" There are some great swing songs like Royal Crown Revues ""Hey Pachuco played in the movie. This really could be considered a musical in many ways. This is a fantastic film. It's fun the whole family can relate to and is a must own. The DVD is pretty easy to find cheap, so don't miss out on this fun film.",The Mask
223,MovieFan095,My Favorite Jim Carrey Movie of All Time,9,16 December 2019,"Jim Carrey is a really funny comedian, and this is my favorite movie that he stars in. The Mask is a classic comedy and for 25 years old, it still looks really good to this very day.The movie is about an average guy, Stanley Ipkiss (played by Jim Carrey) and he is living a mediocre life as a banker and being swept under the rug. One night, he comes across a legendary mask that, when he puts on, turns him into a full blown crazy and wacky guy. Stanley uses these powers to hit on a hot chick, Tina (played by Cameron Diaz) and to stop this mob group from robbing and later wanting to kill Tina.Everything about this movie was fantastic. The dialogue and quotes from Carrey were funny and clever, the special effects were impressive for 1994, and pacing was fast and great.Also, this is Cameron Diaz's first movie, and I gotta say, she did a wonderful job as playing the love interest. Her character was likable, sweet, and there was great chemistry with her and Carrey on screen.Overall, I love The Mask. It's Jim Carrey at his best because he gets to have superpowers and be funnier than ever.This movie is WAY WAY better than that terrible sequel known as ""Son of the Mask"" which is one of the worst sequels ever made.",The Mask

He is extremely funny in the Mask, the acting of the mask he turns into is brilliant and hilarious! The way he moves his teeth makes me laugh out loud because its so damn funny! It definitely surprised me that such a good movie could be made in 1994.Also Cameron Diaz does a great job for I'm quite sure of her very first movie. I always thought she was quite pretty but just ordinary but when she came onto the see when I first saw the Mask earlier this year, my mouth dropped in awe. She looked so good! She began well, and I think it boosted her career with the stunning acting.I've always enjoyed the way Jim Carrey makes a fool of himself in such films as Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty. I am actually looking forward to seeing 'Fun with Dick And Jane'.FINAL RATING- Worth the watch, Classic Comedy!",The Mask

And it's just not funny. I didn't really laugh at all throughout the whole thing. And I didn't really like any of the characters, Stanley is creepy around women, so is his friend.

It also brings out the deep inner repressed character of a person, be it for good or for evil. For the character of Stanley Ipkiss, the deep inner self is a collage of old movies and cartoons with the soul of a hopeless romantic thrown in for good measure.The idea of the Mask is a unique story idea, and it provides the perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey to act out his palette of comic abilities.Unfortunately the story is also riddled with clichés: the loser male figure defeats the villain, becomes the hero and wins the girl, the cop is bumbling and uptight, the one-dimensional crime-lord is pure evil, and so on.But one can forgive the clichés and get lost in the pure spectacle that is Jim Carrey doing his thing. It is hard to envision this film having been successful without Carrey as the lead. Cameron Diaz also puts in a respectable performance as the love interest in this career launching endeavour.While it's no cinematic masterpiece, the Mask is fun and highly entertaining. I would like to see more from story creators Michael Fallon and Mark Verheiden.",The Mask

But let's not forget the colorful visuals and beautiful, on-the-spot photography, that really makes this film shine. As old-fashioned as this film is in many ways, it's also simply irresistible.

230,josephbarker,JWB's Mask Review,9,24 August 2016,"Ahh The Mask... One of my favorite movies from my childhood along with Jurassic Park... I use to own this movie on VHS but now I own it on Blu-Ray... But It has a very interesting history, Back in the 80's The Mask was nothing more then a Twisted Horror Comic published by Dark Horse Comics (No surprise really Dark Horse are always publishing some Dark stuff, But they have done some good stories like Aliens Vs Predator, Indiana Jones, Star Wars and some James Bond comics, But these days they've been publishing some Interesting stuff lie Anime and Manga based comics, Isn't that right, Mark Crilley? the man who did Brody's Ghost.) But then New Line Cinema brought the rights to the comic to make a series of films, in order to recreate the success of the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise the same horror franchise that put New Line on the map... Thank You Freddy Krueger for making this possible. Freddy Krueger: It's no problem Mr Barker, I also advised New Line to let Warner Bros. Entertainment by New Line to save us from bankruptcy... How ever When WB did a Remake of My movie, It didn't go the way they wanted.JWB: I'll be sure to check it out along with your film series and Freddy vs. Jason, Back then when people first heard they where making a movie of this Green Face, Some of them where like ""There is no way this is ever gonna work!"" Not only was the old comics Demented, Cruel and sick, But the Comic Book movie of the mid 90s where really crap at the time, Like Spawn, Batman & Robin, STEEL and Tank Girls, But when this movie was finally released, People where very very VERY surprised that Not only did the Movie barely resemble the comic but it was damn good for a change making it one of them weird rare exceptions of a movie adaptations the doesn't follow the original source material and is better for it Which explains why there are movies out there that are deviating from the original source material, Reasons why they did this change is to make it more appealing to everyone.I've watched this movie in the past and to this day, And clips of it in a Mexican hang out called the Coco Bongo like in the movie... hmm guess I now know where that idea came from. I really like this movie, Sure the effects might be cheesy a bit, But that is was makes this movie stand out among the bad ones in the past... Jim Carrey is perfect in this movie yeah he did Ace Ventura and he was The Riddler from Batman Forever...But the lest I hear about it's stand-Alone Sequel Son of the Mask, the better, For it was already covered by the Blockbuster Buster and the Nostalgia Critic with very questionable results... A big Horrific Let down to the Mask Franchise, If someone tries to do another sequel... Please let it be a Direct and proper sequel to the first Mask movie.",The Mask

Ipkiss uses his newfound powers to woo the heart of Tina (Cameron Diaz) and save the city from an evil gangster. Although Diaz is totally overshadowed by Carrey, his dog and the wild special effects, she still makes an impression. The clever story line is a perfect fit for Carrey's off-the-wall humor. The movie moves at a nice clip with lots of funny little moments to keep you smiling.",The Mask
233,gabe-09926,"OK for adults, Excellent for Kids",5,12 September 2019,"GENERAL CONSENSUS (BAD, OK, GOOD, EXCELLENT): OK for adults, Excellent for Kids*SKIP BELOW TO VIEW MY SETUP
Do you ever wonder why you enjoyed movie more in the theatre than when you bought it on blu ray it home? We all know films are more exciting and exhilirating when watching them in the theatre (i.e. more immersive). The simple answer of course as to why our viewing experiences are better in theatres than at home has to do with the limitations of our media to view it at home (TV's, blu ray playes, home theatre systems, etc.). With the advancements of todays technologies in televisions now days such as high resolution TVs (4k's and beyond), improved media formats (blu ray, 4k UHD) and frame rate manipulation (24P vs 60P) etc., among many other features, this has brought us closer than we've ever been to being able to match theatre qualities that ultimately give us that same immersive experience. Unfortunately some new features of todays tech can actually hurt the viewing experience as well. Your setup is going to be vital to how you experience a film and ultimately what you thougt of it. You may be telling yourself ""well duh, everyone knows that, so whats your point?"" The point I'm trying to make is that not everyone knows this and may have an improper setup when writing a reviews on a film. This is especially concerning to me when I see reviews suggesting films were ""bad,"" ""outdated,"" or ""what were they thinking, people actually thought this was good."" Case in point, PLEASE, make sure you have the proper settings when viewing films before making a review on it as it can most certainly effect what you thought of it.I am a film lover and nothing brings me more satisfaction than to see others experience that same level joy as I do. Conversely, nothing upsets me more than to see a good film get torn to shreds due to an inadequate setup. So instead of giving you my 2 cent review of a film, since there are so many good reviewers out there already, I will simply rate the film and state whether I thought it was good, bad, ok or excellent and tell you how I watched it. Obviously settings are subjectable to each setup and individual perspective and I am in no way shape or form suggesting that my way is the only correct way but rather this is how I enjoyed it and you might like it that way too.",The Mask

I saw this when I was 5 yrs. old, and was scared at first, but then I saw it again, and I was laughing my pants off. In the opening shots of The Mask looks like a low-budget film underwater, with a iron chest resting for ages, until it is unlocked, and a mysterious Mask comes out of the chest and is founded by a nerd loser, bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss. Once he puts it on, it brings his innermost desires to life. The Mask is sort of a mix with Lonney Tunes character, with Tasmanian Devil, like the spinning tornado, as the Mask transforms, dying on a thugs arm like Bug Bunny, Tex Avery's Wolf at the Coco Bongo Club. As a result, the character played by Jim Carrey is half real, and half cartoon. The Mask has great comic elements, and is laugh out funny, Carrey gives his best performance as a cartoon character.

241,Flamingwad,the way the mask speaks to me in july 2002,9,28 July 2002,"Looking back at a film largely forgotten by the general moviegoing public years ago, I notice there is something about the mask that really represents a different style of creativity when it comes to the art of computer generated special effects. A critic of movies should take another look at this movie and notice the drastic ways the use of computer generated special effects has spiraled out of control. Films nowaday have muddled the true entertainment of special effects with lavish overproduction. When an entire city is digitally created and zoomed through with a free range 3d camera it is not the same as when 3D effects and live action play off of each other naturally. In The Mask Jim Carrey becomes a god, he can do anything he wants to do, bend the true elements of reality around him, and his insanity is brought to life with the use not even MILDLY TASTEFUL visual effects. These special effects are over the top, but they are not RIDICULOUS. Reality is getting cheapened by computer generated graphics. Any movie can have good special effects. Mortal Kombat, Annihilation had great special effects, so did Lost in Space. Those are horrible, horrible movies. Take me back to the days with movies were tasteful, subtle, subversive, extreme, calculated. Movies like Road to Perdition and the upcoming Gangs of New York are looking interesting, but still there is a flood of mainstream brainpan droppings that start sucking out your lifeforce as soon as you start to stare into their idiot void and don't stop until you're out 8.50 are contaminating the market and putrifying American cinema.

Despite Cameron Diaz's beauty, she couldn't steal the show away from Jim Carrey who was on fire. An instant classic and a very entertaining movie to watch. I wish there was a part two; too bad it was put to an end. I'd say that the weak link in this movie was the villain. He needed to be more aggressive and evil, but overall not a bad job. The Mask was a very charismatic character and made the movie more fun to watch. The visual effects were pretty good also.

I cant say anything more, its just him Carry's best film to me, and deserves a little more recognition. This movie set out a cartoon series(which was not as good since the joke of putting a cartoon in real life is gone) and eventually a sequel, which i did not enjoy much either.

247,universalkinggamerguy,One of the best superhero and comedy movies altogether,7,30 May 2019,"Normally I'm not a big fan of superhero movies as they usually have a skeletal plot mainly being good vs. evil, the screenplays are usually not tight, the editing is always weak, their movies tend to drag making some audience members die of boredom and the acting is never usually great with actors usually hamming or underperforming their part. Superhero movies usually target children, teenagers, geeks & nerds, people who love action and don't care for meaningful cinema and other sorts of audience members. The biggest problem I have with superhero movies is that they don't really feel like movies but it's more like one is going to an amusement park or something else.Comedy movies aren't that good either as they're usually exhibit an immature, raunchy, silly or young nature especially the comedy movies of the last 2 decades.But this movie proved that superhero and comedy movies can be good with the right content and humor provided and boy oh boy does Jim Carrey give such a knockout performance. In fact, this is Jim Carrey's best comedy work to date and he hasn't followed up with a comedy this brilliant since. Gosh I miss this Jim Carrey as he has aged and moved on.The movie starts off with a typically bland note and we are introduced to Stanley, a stereotypical shy nice man who lets people take advantage of him and doesn't say anything then he comes across a mysterious mask and wears it.Once he wears the mask, he becomes ""The Mask"" and what follows up is several humorous scenes. The funniest scene is the chick-chicki boom scene and the pre-climax fight scene is super hilarious especially the Dog wearing the mask.A big problem with this movie is that the movie drags in between and parts of this boring, but otherwise this movie was great comedy for its time.Direction is decent Editing is weak too many unrequired scenes in the screenplayJim Carrey steals the show and is perfect in his role both in his nice guy character and as the mischievous Mask superhero. In fact he is the soul of this movie and his brand of comedy makes this movie all the more watchable and uplifts the value of this movie.Cameron Diaz looks good and is okay in her part, Peter Reigert is very good, Peter Greene is okay, Richard Jeni is fun to watch and the rest are alright.",The Mask

I have to say, The Mask was one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies if only because he gets to bounce around the screen like a cartoon character. He was made for a role that's literally a cartoon. Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a foil to his alter ego in the mask, who is almost a character on his own. Not only does it show the regular character growth that comes in a movie like this, it presents more comedy than some ""comparable"" works like ""Stranger Than Fiction"" from Will Ferrell. Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) is the perfect ""unattainable"" girl for Stanley: hot, almost oppressed, and may actually be looking for a nice guy - even if she doesn't realize it. Though that may be a little cliché, it works because Stanley gets the girl in the end.I think the real shame was that they couldn't get Carrey for the sequel and that the Son of the Mask turned out to be such a flop.",The Mask

A better idea would be that The Wachowski Brothers would do it instead, they sure know how to do a perfect movie.",The Mask

257,a-topping1,Carrey at his best!,8,16 April 2005,"A great mad-cap film full of laughs! Down on his luck guy finds mask that transforms him in to a superhero, sounds normal enough, doesn't it?! This film allows Jim Carrey to perform at his best, and he takes full advantage. He shows, I believe, why he is one of the best comedic actors around today, he seems to have no boundaries and is so full of energy he could make your head spin, but they're good things! This film also introduced the world to Cameron Diaz, and what an intro!! She doesn't really shine in this film, but as her first, was probably never expected to do so, she's a nice bit of eye candy for the guys, and I'm sure they don't mind! There are plenty of really funny moments and a bit of sentiment too, in all a great film!",The Mask
258,derry-pt8,Perfect summer comedy,7,5 March 2012,"The Mask was a perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. It not only allowed provided the perfect justification to flamboyantly engage in his rubber-faced antics in a manner even more over-the-top than what he'd become famous for, but it provided an opportunity to stretch his acting chops towards a more serious side at just the right time in his career, paving the way for later work such as Man on the Moon (1999), The Majestic (2001) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004).The success of the film wholly depends on Carrey, as he has to sell his characters' frenzied insanity so that it's believable as a reflection of Stanley's inner self while at the same time likable but teetering on the edge of becoming obnoxiously overbearing. Of course, the amazing special effects and make-up help, as well as the clever script and more than competent directing and cinematography, but with the wrong actor in the part, the whole affair could have easily collapsed. The other cast members are fine in supporting roles, with Cameron Diaz coming across as being almost otherworldly beautiful, but Carrey is rarely off-screen, and rightly so.The Mask is notable for both spoofing almost the whole history of cinema while at the same time respectfully paying homage to it. The audience is treated to everything from silent film slapstick to lavish musical numbers (with excellent songs), frenzied Tex Avery-styled animation to gangster film suspense. On its surface, the film is a crazy, often funny, hyperactively paced cinematic pastiche.The subtext about identity and public faces versus private selves is interesting, but not the focus. It would be fine to explore further, but to do so in this particular film would have taken too much time away from Carrey's surrealistic tour de force. Besides, we've had later films where that subtext has been closer to the heart of a story, such as Catwoman (2004), and where it was very thoroughly and competently dealt with.",The Mask
259,khloeey95,A Favourite From My Childhood!,10,28 June 2018,"I'm writing this as I watch this film for what could be the hundredth time (or possibly more since I've been told that me and my friend used to ask to watch this every day, after school, when we were really little), and I just have to say that this will always be a favourite film of mine. Always. I think this must be the first film that I ever saw that starred Jim Carrey and since then, I've considered Carrey to be one of my favourite actors of all time (alongside Robin Williams). You can't help but love how wacky, and lovably quirky, he is in this film! I know that should I have kids in the future, I will definitely have to show them this film - who knows, they might even love it as much as I do!It's funny, crazy, hilarious, amazing, enjoyable, and seriously epic to watch! Favourite moments/scenes/quotes (from The Mask):1) His first transformation with the mask. (And when he says ""Look ma, I'm roadkill. Ha-ha-HA!"" - I would find this so funny when I was little).
2) His singing and dancing scenes (with Cameron Diaz's character, and his rendition of ""Cuban Pete"" with the police).
3) His scene in the park with Cameron Diaz's character when he says something along the lines of ""J'adore, j'adore, shut the window, I don't care!"" (I'm not at this scene just yet and can't remember the line exactly as it is, but I always found it hilarious).
4) And the scenes in the casino where he gives a speech for ""winning an award"", asks ""Did you miss me..? I guess not!!"", and when he swallows the dynamite and exclaims ""That's a spicy meatball!"" with an accent.There are numerous moments in The Mask that are noteworthy, alongside the ones I've listed above, and just as funny and great to watch. If you haven't seen this film, I would truly recommend that you watch it as soon as possible. If you love comedy and really want to have a laugh, then this would be a great choice!",The Mask
260,3Shirts,A movie for everyone,9,20 February 2005,"I disagree with the other reviewer, when I first saw this movie I was 16 and I thought it was brilliant. I am 22 now and I still like it. The only reason you should avoid this movie is if you dislike Jim Carrey's style of overacting and being silly (I know some do). Otherwise he is great in this and without him I don't think the concept would work at all. There is a balance of story with all the comedy and while it isn't a life changing movie it is fun and well made, the effects are great for a film of it's age and stand up OK even 10 years later. The characters are ideal, the two detectives are the perfect double act and Cameron Diaz is both incredibly beautiful and talented in her first big role. In summary, I think adults can enjoy the silliness and the comedy as much the kids and the plot, acting and effects knit the whole lot together really well.",The Mask
261,Oly-5,"Pure fun, yeah !!!",9,23 January 1999,I think this film is better to watch two times - so you could give a real price to the actors phrases... Jim could play this role even without a mask i think :) One of the best comedies with great special effects - the best of which is Jimmy The Mask :) If you have never seen it - you missed a lot !

And it was my first foreign movie i've seen. And since that time i know the ideal script. for 1994 year effects used in this film were INCREDIBLE! No one movie can fight with Mask for really ""usefull"" effects that are needed in movie. I'm Russian, and i can't explain this well, but i know such words as incredible, awesome, amazing, beautiful, fantastic... But ""the Mask"" is FILM! not comedy or drama, thriller or fantastic...

But now I'm old enough to understand and appreciate the plot, comedy and effects it's a lot more enthralling experience.The effects are absolutely mind-blowing. Especially when Carrey's in the club during Cameron Diaz's song when he turns into a Tex Avery like hound.Above all it's the quick one-liners and physical comedy that shine through. I was hysterical with laughter in the park/ Cuban Pete scene.Those of you that have seen the film will probably agree, if you've seen it for the first time recently... what the hell took you so long.",The Mask

269,evanavan,"Awesome, under-rated classic.",10,28 September 2006,"How often do you see a movie like this? It absolutely rocks. Even though it tones down the violence of the dark horse comics, it seamlessly blends Tex Avery style wackiness into the real world. If that does'nt reflect the inner child in us and what everyone wants to be, then what does? Firstly, the main character is brilliant. Hes an explosive combination of all the wacky toons we all love. But the difference is that its all amplified 10 times over and its all real! You actually combine all this wackiness into a very serious, realistic, dark and gritty world. The guy who came up with the 'Tornado' routine needs to be given a major award. This has to be Jim Carrey's best performance in his career and for once, hes not overacting or being annoying. Cameron Diaz looks her best in this movie.The actors who play Kellaway and Doyle also give very likable performances. The villain is also very well played but he loses his charm when he puts on the Mask. The music is also awesome. This is one extremely enjoyable film that is also very posh, cleanly cut and refined despite its subject matter and content. The production values are very high.My only complaint about this movie is that it does'nt have enough of the 'Mask' himself. For that you'd need to go and see the animated series but the latter is not at all as good as the movie itself, strangely.",The Mask

273,johnstone-richards,Unbelievably good,8,1 July 2017,"If you ask me, 'The Mask' is Jim Carrey's best work ever. It's his best movie and the only one of him I find really great. It's not a movie without its faults, but it's original, imaginative, creative and has very good comical gags. It's a classic. Or, to use only one word to describe it: ""Smokin!""Jim Carrey can be two things: either a really funny comedian either a comedian who does his job well but overacts, although no one can deny that there is a genius inside this man. In 'The Mask' he is awesome. I consider this one of his best actings of all time, if not his very best.In 'The Mask' Jim Carrey portrays Stanley Ipkiss, a clerk in a nice Edge City bank. He is a very nice and easy-going guy with great sense of humor (which matches his funny name). He is «the nicest guy», yet shy and somewhat depressed and he does not have much success in his job and personal life. He doesn't have much friends, except for his co-worker Charlie and his loyal dog Milo (a Jack Russell Terrier). Stanley likes to watch cartoons (particularly a Tex Avery one with a whistling wolf), decorates his apartment with items from these cartoons and he has the most unusual pajama :)Jim Carrey also portrays the title character (The Mask), which is the other side of Stanley Ipkiss... or at least what he wants to be but can't be without the mask. The mask gives him superpowers and courage to do things he wouldn't be able to do without it. For example, he can dance like Fred Astaire, Gumby and Barishnikov (all together) - and he can flirt with the gorgeous Tina Carlyle. The Mask is a cartoonish figure that can do incredible things.This film is a crazy comedy, a film that surpasses the limits of imagination. Yet, despite its cartoonish humor, it also works well as a thriller and has a dark atmosphere. At the same time, this movie is clearly inspired (in many ways) on several cartoons, such as the Looney Tunes, Tex Avery's 'Red Hot Riding Hood' and even the live action/animation movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. The movie also has great sceneries and backgrounds, as well as great lines, nice special effects and its magic.Cameron Diaz in this movie... my goodness! Is there any guy who wouldn't fall in love with her in this film? She was really a stunning beauty in this film. She was absolutely at her hottest and most sensual here: she was more curvy, sexier, so beautiful and her smile was even more enchanting. Her role as the gorgeous and loving Tina Carlyle was a great acting debut for her. Plus, she was great in this role. In fact, she was a better actress in her early acting years than in more recent years. And she got slimmer with time.Cameron Diaz also sings very well in this film, with a husky, jazz-like voice. What a difference comparing to 'My Best Friend's Wedding', where she sings terribly. She was 21 years old in 'The Mask' but she surely looked older than that. She is really like a live-action version of Jessica Rabbit in this film.Other funny characters (along with Stanley Ipkiss) are Charlie Schumacher, Milo, Detective Doyle and the impatient Lt. Mitch Kellaway.Most of the soundtrack is great: the opening theme and other instrumental themes during the movie and even the cheerful songs ""Hey Pachuco"" and ""Cuban Pete"" - this last one is sung by Jim Carrey himself in a hilarious part where he (as The Mask) dances and makes the policemen dance either. It really makes one wanna dance.Most actors are pretty good in their roles: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, Ben Stein, Amy Yasbeck, Richard Jeni, Nancy Fish, Jim Doughan and Max.Max is the name of the dog that portrays Milo. The intelligence of that dog deserves to be mentioned. This breed of dog is known for its intelligence and loyalty, but also for being lovable, playful and stubborn dogs. Milo is all of that. Plus, Milo seems to understand everything they tell him. When his master is giving him orders, he moves his head as if he is understanding every word that is said. Plus, he climbs a considerably tall wall to rescue Stanley and we can see in his eyes when he is feeling fear, joy and sadness, for example. What a fabulous dog actor!The loaner... what a piece of junk! That car makes its own scenes hilarious! Why? Simply because of what it is: a charger in a junkyard.Jim Carrey makes this movie as good as it is. I believe that this movie couldn't possibly be this good without the great Jim Carrey. This role was made for him and couldn't be played by other than him.This should definitely be on Top 250.",The Mask

But because of lack of money, it slowly became a wish in my memory. Today I watched this film, and it is simply the pioneer of the times.

Cameron Diaz is such an amazing actor and it was interesting to see a comedy person and a sexy blonde seducing person come together and fall in love with each other.

This movie still makes me collapse on the floor laughing at Jim Carrey's silly antics after watching it maybe 20 times. My personal favorite bit is when Stanley Ipkiss aka The Mask (Carrey) spontaneously turns into ""Cuban Pete"", a singer/dancer/one-man band whose catchy music gets the entire police department dancing to avoid arrest. Although I generally enjoy more clever, witty humor, Jim Carrey's slapstick is no less than brilliant, with incredibly funny impersonations and perfectly timed gags. Equally good is the film's plot, which remains funny, interesting, and engaging to the very end. 10 out of 10 stars, no questions asked. If you haven't already seen it, rent or borrow it.",The Mask

When we arrived at the cinema and saw the poster showing The Mask we did not feel like watching it. But as it was a long way home we decided to go and see the film. And we enjoyed the movie so much that we decided to go to see it next day again. The first time we watched it we did not catch everything as our eyes were flooded with tears of laugh and our bellies hurt form laugh cramps. The story is really catching and Jim Carry is simply fabulous. The plot makes you think what it would be like if you had the mask and what you would do with it.

282,cameronadrian,Ahead of its time,9,8 May 2018,"First, I would like to say that without Jim Carrey; the Grinch, Ace Ventura, (the mask) and many other classic movies, wouldn't have been half of what they are. The Mask is an older movie that stars Jim as Stanley Ipcus, an overly nice bank teller who's kind of a push over. One day, Stanley meets Tina (Cameron Diaz), a dancer at the local night club and a bombshell. Stanley doesn't have the guts at first to ask her out, but he finds an old Norse mask (it belongs to Loki, god of mischief) by accident. When he puts on the mask, he becomes a flirtatious cartoon character that has superpowers and a large amount of confidence, something Stanley lacked on the outside. I love this movie, and I think that compared to movies around its time, they went for a new style mixing cartoon comedy and real characters. This allows for a younger audience to enjoy it as well as the parents of said kids. Yes, there are definitely some corny scenes, especially the fight scenes, but this sort of laid the framework for future movies that would do this type of interaction. I gave it a 9/10 because it had my attention the whole movie, Cameron Diaz is a bombshell, and Jim Carrey couldn't have played the Mask any better (in my opinion). One of the best scenes in this movie is where the mob boss makes one of his henchmen lay down and he hits a golf ball off a tee in his mouth. This scene was particularly powerful because the rest of the movie is relatively calm and less violent but this scene had a lot of potential for it. The mob boss ends up letting him go and this power play scene showed no questions to who's in charge, and what he's willing to do if you cross him. Of course, at this time in film history, happy-ever-after endings were quite popular, and this was one of them. The final fight scene is quite unorthodox, but Milo saves the day and the way they incorporated all the characters backstories and tied them together, really made the movie amazing to me.",The Mask
