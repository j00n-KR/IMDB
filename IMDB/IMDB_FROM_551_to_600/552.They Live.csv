0,MartinHafer,wow does this movie NEED a remake!!,7,11 June 2005,"This movie has many flaws, but underneath them all it has the basic core of a fantastic sci-fi movie. Remaking it could easily take is from slightly above average to GREAT.The flaws: 1. One reviewer says this movie is a cheap shot at the Reagan era. That's probably true, but despite my being a conservative, I didn't mind this underlying tone. 2. The machismo, at time, is so over-the-top it's like watching a WWF wrestling match--which shouldn't be surprising due to Rowdy Roddy Piper (a pro-wrestler) playing the lead character. This probably was much of the reason they included the completely inane and mega-stupid fist fight between him and his best friend. What were they thinking? The only way the movie could have gotten more off track was if Vince McMahon or Hulk Hogan had made an appearance!Despite this, the plot is FANTASTIC!!! The notion that the Earth is being secretly run by aliens who appear like us (due to amazing high tech devices) as well as humans who knowingly work with them simply because ""it pays well"" is so jaded and paranoid but so cool when you see it in action in the movie.So, my advice is to watch it on tape and speed through the stupid fight sequence. Without that, the movie should get a 9.",They Live
1,Leofwine_draca,One of John Carpenter's last great movies,9,12 November 2016,"Once upon a time, John Carpenter made great film after great film. It happened in the '70s, it happened in the '80s...and then mid-way through the '90s, something went wrong and he started turning out rubbish. Thankfully, THEY LIVE is one of his glory-day efforts, a cult film that manages to succeed despite a low, low budget. The reason? It's original. It might be yet another alien invasion flick at heart, but INDEPENDENCE DAY this is not. It's got brains, thought behind it, and genuine surprises throughout. It's also a satire of '80s consumerism just as biting as more 'worthy' flicks like American PSYCHO.I really enjoyed the first half an hour, which steadfastly refuses to reveal ANYTHING that's going on. The viewer's wondering what the heck it's all about, and then Roddy puts on those sunglasses and BAM! – one of the best twists in screen history. I think so, anyway. I love the idea of the truth-revealing sunglasses and the aliens using the human race as cattle; I loved the wit of the posters and magazines reading stuff like 'CONSUME' and 'STAY ASLEEP'. It's logical, it's believable, and at the same time, it's a whole load of fun. Some people criticise the special effects in this film, particularly the simple blue-and-red masks that make up the alien faces. Nothing wrong with these. While the little UFOs may seem cheesy today, those aliens are VERY creepy. I watched this film as an impressionable 15 year old, and it creeped me out then; today it still creeps me out. Great use of monochrome photography adds to the illusion.One of the most engaging things about this film is its low budget nature – it means Carpenter had to work harder on what is, I suspect, a labour of love. His synthesiser score, repeated throughout the film, is a familiar trademark, as is his icy humour. The casting of a wrestler in the leading role is guaranteed to raise a few eyebrows, but Roddy Piper is a likable presence who carries the film ably. It helps that he's supported by some acting stalwarts – Keith David reprising his hard-man role and Meg Foster as an icy is-she-or-isn't-she villainess. Halfway through the proceedings, the movie turns into a nostalgic '80s action-fest, complete with muscle men toting sub machine guns, explosions, and all manner of cheesiness. Highlights include a lengthy fist fight between our two heroes and any scene involving those aliens. A fantastically enjoyable oddity!",They Live
2,SnoopyStyle,Great concept but poorly executed,5,14 October 2014,"Nada (Roddy Piper) is a drifter who come to L.A. skid row. He gets a construction job and co-worker Frank (Keith David) leads him to an outdoor homeless camp. Gilbert (Peter Jason) is the leader of the camp. Nada follows Gilbert into a church. He finds sunglasses and 'They Live We Sleep' written on the walls. The police comes to raid the church and tear down the camp. The next day, Nada goes back to the church to find a box of those sunglasses. When he puts them on, he sees the world as it actually is. The world is full of subliminal messages and the most power people are all weird looking aliens. He starts getting in trouble with the cops and he kidnaps Holly (Meg Foster) to hide out at her home.I certainly like the concept behind this movie but I don't really like Roddy Piper. He has a very narrow acting range. He's only good for fighting. Also I don't like the character as he is written. He can't give those sunglasses away. The fight to put them on Frank is ridiculously stupid. It is a great concept wasted by a poor leading man and a weak execution. The guys literally fell into the alien headquarters. The whole final battle looks so badly done. I have never seen any movie character get shot and fall backwards like that. And they did it twice. This is just so badly done.",They Live
3,Prismark10,They Live,4,6 November 2019,"They Live wants people to wake up and see what is happening in society. Conservatives have hijacked the term 'woke' as an insult.John Carpenter wanted to satire Reaganomics in They Live. Only to find that a few decades later that the enemy has twisted his message for their own nefarious purposes. Neo Nazi groups show They Live to their brain dead followers to demonstrate that the Jews are running the world.Roddy Piper plays a nameless, homeless drifter looking for a job in Los Angeles.When he gets a construction job, a fellow worker Frank (Keith David) takes him to a rapidly growing homeless camp. There he sees interference on a television screen and a preacher talking about a great conspiracy.Piper finds some sunglasses in a box and when he puts them on, he sees hidden subliminal messages all around him. The rich, powerful elite are skeletal beings with some humans who collaborate with them. Piper needs to let humanity know of the alien presence.Carpenter has made an updated version of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Unfortunately despite the satirical tone and the political subtext. This is a flat film that descends into silly action scenes. It is dull and lethargic for long periods. Piper's lack of acting skills do not help, probably as the Reagan supporting wrestler turned actor never believed in the message in the first place.",They Live
4,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best John Carpenter's Films,8,21 May 2011,"The unemployed construction worker George Nada (Roddy Piper) drifts to Los Angeles and finds a job. Nada is a man that believes on the American Dream and expects to have his big chance someday. He befriends the worker Frank Armitage (Keith David) that is a conformist and invites Nada to camp in the homeless settlement where he lives. Nada observes that the television has weird interferences from a pirate transmission of a man that belongs to an underground movement and notes a strange movement of people in the church on the other side of the settlement.Nada sneaks around the church and finds a box with pairs of sunglasses. When he wears the glasses, he discovers that the average people is being dominated and subdue by subliminal messages and several persons are aliens indeed. Further, the elites are corroborating with the invaders, receiving financial support in return. Nada forces Frank to wear the sunglasses and together they seek other humans aware of the situation to organize a resistance against the powerful aliens from Andromeda and their associates.""They Live"" is a B-movie by John Carpenter and one of his best films. Years before the red-pill of ""Matrix"", a simple worker finds the real world wearing a pair of very special sunglasses. Nada learns that the fight of classes in the American society is supported by aliens, in a sharp social and political critic to the neo-liberalism of Ronald Reagan that affected the lower classes.I do not recall how many times I have watched this film. I am a big fan of John Carpenter and in my opinion, this great director, writer and musician deserves an Oscar for his magnificent filmography. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Eles Vivem"" (""They Live"")Note: On 15 July 2013, I saw this movie again on DVD.Note: On 22 August 2015, I saw this film again.Note: On 15 September 2020, I saw this film again.",They Live
5,gavin6942,"Oh, They Live Alright",7,2 March 2006,"The story of a homeless man (Roddy Piper) who stumbles upon some sunglasses that give him the ability to see the media's true messages and what lies beneath the skin of some of earth's more powerful people. (Hint: Either someone was reading too much David Icke before filming this, or Icke stole his philosophy from this film.)The film started as the 1963 short story ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning"" by Ray Nelson. Nelson is an interesting guy in his own right, having studied theology and meeting the greats of the Beat Generation before becoming a science fiction writer alongside his friend Philip K. Dick. The short story (only a few pages) was very heavily used: the name Nada, the reptilians, the hidden messages, and the key component of the TV station. This is possibly John Carpenter's most under-rated movie. Unlike ""The Fog"", ""Halloween"" or ""Assault on Precinct 13"", which were doing just fine, this is the one most in need of a remake with updated technology and special effects. Not that any ought to be remade, but this one makes sense. But do not get me wrong, they did great with what they had.The plot drags at times (especially in the first half), and the messages get repetitive, but the underlying satire is a somewhat biting one -- though maybe not as blunt as I would like. There is an interesting interpretation of the free enterprise system, wherein aliens are using America -- and presumably the rest of Earth -- for natural resources, as though we were the Third World and to be exploited. What is interesting is if you take this to the next logical step, which the film does not.Assuming it is justifiable for us to fight off the foreign menace who are using our resources to make themselves rich while we suffer, it stands to reason that the Third World people have the right to fight off foreign invaders who exploit them for their resources and make them suffer. Which I presume is the point of this film -- causing us to think about how some people are rich and others are not. The answer is because we can turn our backs to the poor and feel no guilt.Carpenter has said this film is a response to the policies of the Reagan era. And that is undoubtedly what called Carpenter to action, but to pin this as anti-Reagan is too narrow. The film condemns consumer culture as a whole, which is not a conservative versus liberal issue. It is an American issue, or even a first world issue.But, yeah. Starring Rowdy Roddy Piper. Fighting police. And getting into the most memorable fight in movie history with Keith David... which seems like 15 minutes, but is really only 5 minutes and 20 seconds. You will wish it was longer, trust me. What more to say? Watch this movie! Carpenter's second best sci-fi movie, next to ""The Thing"", easily. Recommended!Scream Factory has released the definitive edition of this film on Blu-ray. Not only does it look and sound great, but it has a full-length commentary from Carpenter and Piper. The back of the disc says it has ""more"" features than listed, and this is quite right: you will be bust for hours watching all the content, including an interview with Meg Foster.",They Live
6,lee_eisenberg,chewing bubble gum and striking a blow for the exploited common man,7,17 April 2006,"Given how we're constantly barraged by advertising and such things, it was inevitable that they'd make a movie like ""They Live""; and specifically, that only John Carpenter could make the movie. It features wrestler Roddy Piper as a drifter who, after putting on some strange sunglasses, can suddenly see that various advertisements are actually telling people to obey authority, and that many people in high positions are actually aliens enforcing the status quo.It seems that this is probably an allusion to the exploitation of the common man by the rich and powerful (as a previous reviewer suggested), even if the movie takes a horror-comedic approach to everything - namely the ""bubble gum"" quote. I'd call it worth seeing. Also starring Keith David and Meg Foster.",They Live
7,jboothmillard,They Live,5,6 September 2020,"I recognised the poster for this scary movie when I looked it up, and I'm pretty sure I saw images from it in the John Landis book Monsters in the Movies, so I hoped for something fun, directed by John Carpenter (Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, Escape from New York, The Thing). Basically, drifter John Nada (Roddy Piper) arrives in Los Angeles looking for work. While out on the street, he sees a Street Preacher (Raymond St. Jacques) warning that ""they"" have recruited the rich and powerful to control humanity. Nada gets a job on a construction site and befriends fellow construction worker Frank (Keith David), who introduces him to shantytown (a town of crudely built huts) leader Gilbert (Peter Jason). That night, a hacker interrupts television broadcasts, claiming that scientists had discovered signals that were enslaving the population and keeping them in a dream-like state, and that the only way to stop it is to destroy the signal at its source. Those watching the broadcast complain of headaches. Nada secretly follows Gilbert and the street preacher into a nearby church and discovers they are meeting with a group that includes the hacker. He sees scientific equipment and cardboard boxes inside, and Gilbert worrying that the Hoffman lenses they made won't be enough without ""strong people"" to help them. Nada is discovered by the blind preacher and escapes. That night, the shantytown and church are destroyed in a police raid, who surround and beat the hacker and preacher. The following day, Nada retrieves one of the cardboard boxes containing many pairs of sunglasses, he takes a pair, hiding the rest in a trash can. Putting on the glasses, Nada discovers that they make the world appear black and white, revealing subliminal messages in the media to obey, consume, reproduce, and conform. The glasses also make many people appear to have skull-like faces, revealing that they are actually aliens. When Nada mocks an alien woman at a supermarket, she realises he can see her true form, and alerts other aliens via a mysterious wristwatch. Nada leaves but is confronted by two alien cops. He kills them and steals their weapons. Nada enters a bank, holding the shotgun, he sees several bank employees and customers are aliens. He states ""I have come here to chew bubble gum, and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubble gum."" He then murders several aliens and escapes by taking Cable 54 employee Holly Thompson (Meg Foster) hostage. At Holly's home, Nada tries to get her to try on the glasses, but she knocks him out of the window and down a hill, and then calls the police. Nada returns to the alley and retrieves the box of sunglasses from a garbage truck. Frank appears to give Nada his paycheck. Nada tries to get Frank to put on a pair of the glasses, but Frank thinks Nada is a murderer and refuses to listen to him. Frank and Nada get into a long brawl. Eventually, Frank is too tired to stop Nada from putting the sunglasses on him. After seeing the aliens and a flying saucer, Frank agrees to help and go into hiding with Nada. Frank and Nada find Gilbert, who leads them to an anti-alien movement meeting. At the meeting, they are given contact lenses to replace the sunglasses, and learn that the aliens are using global warming to the planet more like their own and are depleting Earth's resources for their own gain. They also learn that the aliens have been bribing humans to become collaborators, promoting them into positions of power. Holly appears at the meeting, apologising to Nada, with information of where the source of the signal is located. However, the meeting is raided by police and many people present are killed, with the survivors scattering as the police surround the area. Nada and Frank are cornered by police in an alley, but wearing an alien wristwatch, they accidentally activate an opening to a portal that they escape through. The portal transports them to the aliens' spaceport, where they discover a meeting of aliens and human collaborators, celebrating the elimination of the ""terrorists"". They are approached by a former Drifter (George 'Buck' Flower), now a collaborator, who gives them a tour of the facility. He takes them to the basement of Cable 54, the signal source, which is protected by armed guards. Nada and Frank find Holly and fight their way to the transmitter on the roof, but Holly kills Frank, revealing she is a collaborator herself. Nada kills Holly and destroys the transmitter but is fatally wounded by aliens in a helicopter. Nada gives the aliens the middle finger as he dies. With the transmitter destroyed, humans all over the world discover the aliens living among them. Also starring Sy Richardson as Black Revolutionary, Susan Blanchard as Ingenue, and Norman Alden as Foreman. Former wrestler Piper is a rather wooden lead, but then again, his dialogue is rather daft, at least David, Foster and Flower are good support. I will be honest I drifted in and out for the half an hour or so, but as soon as the lead character put on the sunglasses, I recognised the clever satirical aspect with subliminal messages in advertising, I enjoyed the long fight sequence (hilariously spoofed in the South Park episode ""Cripple Fight""), and you does remind of something like a 1950s classic alien invasion movie, a fairly fun science-fiction horror. Worth watching!",They Live
8,Woodyanders,One of John Carpenter's best and boldest films,9,22 March 2013,"Honest and hard-working everyman drifter Nada (a sound and credible Roddy Piper) decides to alert the unsuspecting human race to the existence of sneaky and cunning alien invaders who control our everyday lives and are exploiting various resources for their own nefarious personal gain. Made under the clever (and misleading) guise of being a straightforward and unpretentious Grade B shoot 'em up sci-fi/action opus, writer/director John Carpenter uses the crafty premise as a brilliantly subversive means to make spot-on stinging, trenchant, and provocative social and satirical commentary on mindless conformity and complacency, rampant consumerism run amok, corporate omnipotence, the duplicity and unreliability of television and the mainstream media, the erosion of the middle class, how folks compromise their values on a regular basis in order to achieve substantial wealth and success, and the fiercely drawn delineation between the rich and the poor. Moreover, Carpenter not only does his customary ace job of creating and sustaining a gritty downbeat tone and a brooding paranoid atmosphere, but also delivers plenty of choice cheesy one-liners and tops everything off with a wickedly funny line in sharp sardonic humor. The super acting by the bang-up cast keeps the picture humming: Piper brings an appealingly earnest and believable lived-in quality to the scruffy average guy main character, Keith David gives a splendid performance as Nada's reluctant construction worker ally Frank, Meg Foster radiates a suitably sinister aura as the enigmatic Holly, Peter Jason does engaging work as compassionate underground army resistance leader Gilbert, Raymond St. Jacques registers strongly in his small, yet memorable part as a blind street preacher, and the always enjoyable George ""Buck"" Flower contributes a stand-out portrayal as a treacherous turncoat who sells out mankind so he can have a slice of the good life. A brutally protracted alley way mano-a-mano fight between Nada and Frank rates as a definite exciting highlight. Kudo are also in order for Gary B. Kibbe's neat widescreen cinematography and the fine bluesy score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth. An absolute powerhouse.",They Live
9,rmax304823,Potentially Interesting Flick Torpedoed.,2,5 May 2012,"It has a couple of good one liners of the sort that kewl youngsters will find inspiring.""I'm here to chew bubble gum and kick ass -- and I'm all out of bubble gum."" ""Life's a bitch -- and this one's in heat."" That's about all it has, this clumsy rip off of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" The general notion is that the world has been taken over by aliens. I can almost believe that about Los Angeles. Roddy Piper, unemployed laborer and weight lifter, wanders into town and winds up at a settlement of homeless people. He's not bitter about his humble status. As he tells an acquaintance, Keith David, ""I believe in the American dream."" And who wouldn't? Here's a homeless bum who is always clean shaven by the studio barber and has carefully styled and blow-dried hair.Anyway, Piper, who cannot act, finds a pair of sun glasses that reveal the true nature of the society he lives in. It's run mainly by aliens who have skull-like faces. Without the glasses they look like ordinary people except richer. There are ""subliminal"" messages posted all over the place, visible only when the sun glasses are worn, that have seduced the humans into ant-like workers who never question anything or have independent thoughts. Somehow this is all controlled by a TV antenna.I don't really want to get into the plot because it's absurd to being with and no apparent effort has been made to turn it into anything other than another paranoid vision that justifies violence.Well, I'll give one illustration of what I mean. When Piper picks up the glasses and tries them on for the first time, he discovers what's up at a magazine stand. Stunned, he wanders unthinkingly into a drug store. He puts the glasses on again. Most of the customers and staff have the skull faces of aliens. He takes them off, points to a woman behind one of the counters, and remarks with a smile, ""You know what? You look like you just stuck your head into cheese dip."" If that's what you would do and say if you'd just discovered the world had been taken over by aliens and the humans had been hypnotized into acting like obedient zombies, then this is the movie for you.",They Live
10,ma-cortes,Two down-on-their-luck workers face off an invasion wearing sun-glasses through which they can see the true face of extraterrestrials,7,7 October 2014,"A drifter (John Carpenter wanted a truly rugged individual to play Nada , he cast wrestler Roddy Piper in the lead role after seeing him in WrestleMania III , 1987) discovers a pair of sunglasses that allow him to wake up to the fact that aliens have taken over the Earth . Wearing them, he is able to see the world as it really is , as he watches strange messages : Obey , Buy , Marry and reproduce , Consume , No thought , Stay sleep , Do not question authority , Watch TV , Consume , Obey and consume . The drifter named Nada join forces with a construction worker called Frank (second and final of two collaborations of actor Keith David and director John Carpenter who had previously both worked together on The Thing (1982) around six years earlier) and both of them take on an extraterrestrial threat . The Aliens keep humans in ignorance and they rule our world as they like. Nada and Frank seek other people aware of the situation to carry out a resistance against the hidden extraterrestrial from Andrómeda . This exciting picture become a Cult Movie contains mystery , chills , noisy action , thrills , fights , social critical and bits of humor with tongue in cheek attitude . The movie is full of suspense , weird atmosphere with dark and surprising ending . Interesting screenplay , as Ray Nelson's short story ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning,"" which was the basis for 'They Live'. Roddy Piper and Keith David are pretty good and likable as two workers who unwittingly become involved into a fantastic world underneath . The famous big fight sequence between Roddy Piper and Keith David was designed, rehearsed and choreographed in the back-yard of director John Carpenter's production office . The fight between Nada and Frank was only supposed to last twenty seconds, but Piper and David decided to fight it out for real, only faking the hits to the face and groin. They rehearsed the fight for three weeks ; Carpenter was so impressed he kept the five minutes and twenty seconds scene intact. The film is partially shot in black-and-white which involved only the scenes and sequences where the aliens were visible to the audience when characters are wearing the sunglasses for most of the film , but this visual aesthetic ceases towards the end of the picture whereupon the aliens become visible in color for the film's final act . Adequate special effects , all the various aliens throughout the movie, both male and female, were portrayed by stunt coordinator Jeff Imada . Appropriate support cast such as Meg Foster , George 'Buck' Flower , Peter Jason , Sy Richardson , Raymond St. Jacques and John Carpenter uncredited, as the voice that says ""sleep"" . Is known for an unofficial ""Carpenter's Repertory Group"" of actors who he enjoys working with, including Peter Jason, George 'Buck' Flower, and various crew members . Nice electronic musical rightly fitting the action by the same director John Carpenter . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Gary Kibbe , Carpenter's ordinary .Director John Carpenter is in familiar ground with this well-done tale on the style of comic books and old Sci-Fi serials . This was second and final of two times that director John Carpenter worked with Alive Films , the first was the previous year's Prince of darkness (1987). Writer-director John Carpenter has said of this movie that it was a critique of Reaganomics, a ""vehicle to take on Reaganism"". His films often feature important visuals shown from a video screen , as the end-of-the-world transmission from the future in Prince of darkness (1987), the Norwegian recordings of the expedition to uncover the aliens in The Thing (1982), various TV sets and the general anti-TV motif in this They live¨(1988), etc. ¨They live¨ was realized during his best period in the 70s and late 8os when he directed classics as ¨Halloween¨, ¨The fog ¨, ¨Christine¨, ¨1997 escape from N.Y ¨ , ¨Big Trouble in Little China¨ and ¨The thing¨ . The movie will enjoy to Science Fiction fans but packs a roller-coaster thriller and wholesome amusement . Rating : Above average. The film will appeal to John Carpenter enthusiasts.",They Live
11,BA_Harrison,I bet David Icke has this one on heavy rotation.,9,14 November 2012,"I'm a sucker for a spot of good old-fashioned sci-fi paranoia, and They Live, from director John Carpenter, is one of the finest examples the genre has to offer, a pitch-perfect blend of cutting social commentary, unashamed B-movie silliness, and hard-hitting action.Pre-dating the similarly themed The Matrix by over a decade, and made on a fraction of that film's budget, They Live stars Rowdy Roddy Piper as blue collar construction worker John Nada, who, with the help of a special pair of sunglasses, discovers to his amazement that the world is in fact ruled by ugly aliens who keep the human population under their control through the use of subliminal messages and mind-altering broadcasts. Like The Matrix's Neo, Nada opts to fight his oppressors, joining a group of freedom fighters dedicated to revealing the terrible truth to the unsuspecting public.Full of ingenious ideas, cool visuals, eminently quotable snippets of dialogue, and great fight action, including one of the best prolonged street brawls ever captured on film, They Live is creepy, exciting and funny in equal measures, perfect viewing for anyone who has ever had the sneaking suspicion that all is not as it seems on the surface.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",They Live

13,paul_haakonsen,Much better than I remembered it to be...,6,6 May 2020,"Oddly enough I've always had some kind of aversion towards John Carpenter's 1988 movie ""They Live"". I suppose it was because I wasn't impressed the first time around back in the late 80s when seeing the movie for the first time.But I sat down and watched the movie again in 2020, and turns out that my aversion to the movie was founded on my preference of movies back in the 80s, because I happened to enjoy ""They Live"" today in 2020. It is actually a rather enjoyable and entertaining movie. And it is such a glorious swing at the mentality of consumerism and society, that it is a movie that obviously have survived the passing of time, as it is still very applicable to our world in 2020.The movie's story and plot is nice and enjoyable, and the story progresses nicely throughout the course of the movie.Initially I was also a bit hesitant about the movie as it starred WWF athlete Roddy Piper. But he was actually surprisingly good in the movie, and he did carry his role and character well, not to mention having a lot of memorable one-liners. And it was also nice to see Keith David in this movie.The aliens, parasites, or whatever they were as presented in the movie was actually good. I like the concept of them being hidden in plain sight, blending in around humans and looking exactly like humans, except when seen through a special filter.I am rating ""They Live"" a six out of ten stars. If you haven't already seen this 1988 movie from iconic horror director John Carpenter, you should definitely do so if you have the chance.",They Live
14,Quinoa1984,a brilliantly over-the-top science-fiction/action/satire hybrid; one of the best of 1988,10,8 August 2006,"There's a part of me that, while watching They Live for the first time, thinks 'this is just B-sci fi trash that only attempts shallowly for social and political satire, not to be taken seriously'. But there's another part that outweighs that, which finds this and other John Carpenter films to not meant be taken TOO seriously anyway, all in the (accepted) disbelief that must be taken to really enjoy and admire his work. But as far as being a sort of B-movie goes- and They Live, despite having a bigger budget and more special effects than most, has that spirit in its bones like an old comic book from the 50s- this is probably one of the best I've seen from the past twenty years. Like Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China, it doesn't kid itself what it is for its audience- a hilarious take on subject matter that is not taken for granted. It's an intelligent, hilarious, and extremely entertaining movie, where the subject matter is not very nuanced and (as in Dawn of the Dead) in your face and right up there without question. It's like a 1950s sci-fi piece about invaders from other planets seeking us out for domination, only shifted in the 1980s (and still relevant for today more than ever) and given both realistic grounding and just a pure hard-boiled action film. It has the danger of being cheesy, dismissible material, but somehow it all works much better than expected.For a film like this as well you need a star, who in this case was a WWF superstar, who has much more on-screen machismo and a strong enough presence with some good acting skills. Roddy Piper fits so well into this role it shows the potential that unfortunately hasn't been tapped by most filmmakers. Carpenter sets up the story perfectly well with its ambiguity- it's all from Nada's point of view. (His name is never given, but hey for this story who needs it anyway?) He's a drifter who gets construction work, but by the slums he lives in he sees a church doing strange things, and after an out-of-the-blue incredibly violent police raid, Nada soon finds a pair of sunglasses left behind. He puts it on and his world goes completely awry; many people are aliens, subliminal messages saying terms like 'Obey', and if you're spotted SWAT teams fly in. He draws in the help of his reluctant-to-the-point-of-fighting friend Frank (Keith David, always good but very impressive in his typical tough-guy way) to seek out the source of all of these 'signals' given off by the visitors.Again, this could all be pretty hokey in the wrong hands. But Carpenter trusts the material to the point where he takes it seriously on one side and not on the other. There's a kind of attitude about the film, as with others in his work, that reflect of course cynicism and outrage at the system, but all in the guise of something much more sinister at work. As the best sci-fi gets at criticism of society as it is, the underlying current in They Live does get some very good jabs in. Perhaps what I mean by this divide in serious and not (and yet both sides working well) is when Piper puts on the glasses the first time and almost bugs out at what is all around him. This is a very funny section of the film- possibly the funniest- but it's filmed unpretentiously and the direction is always very concisely with bits of imagination (those black and white inserts, obvious, but always fun). And at the core of this being a satire on the controls of society and breaking off from it (or just not being on it to start with) is not skimping on what some would expect- loaded with guns, violence, action that isn't compounded by excess weight.Featuring a fight sequence that ranks as one of the most intense and amusing in recent memory, perfectly chum-like dialog, one of Carpenter's very best musical scores, and an ending that packs it all in, They Live is a great escapist movie with a message that actually hits. It's also an prime example of a talented filmmaker having something to say through a genre; a tale of suppressed and controlled society with originality, cool, and subversive tact. It'd probably make a neat party movie, too.",They Live

He observes strange happenings at church and on TV. It all culminates in what looks like a giant drug bust, but Piper finds the contraband is only a box of cheap black sunglasses. He puts on a pair and, we're off and running...""They Live!"" is a wild ride from director John Carpenter. He also contributes to the writing (from a Ray Nelson story) and music; the soundtrack is especially outstanding. There are flaws as the film plays on - it's fine until a confrontation inserted more to give viewers a long, bone-crunching fight scene than move the narrative convincingly. The second half is less interesting, but it's never dull. Marvelously-eyed Meg Foster (as Holly Thompson) provides Piper with feminine interest, and there are fine supporting roles for George ""Buck"" Flower and Raymond St. Jacques.

16,BandSAboutMovies,Still important,8,1 June 2021,"Sure, They Live is a science fiction movie based on the 1963 short story ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning"" by Ray Nelson, but isn't it really just another western by way of John Carpenter? Nada (Roddy Piper) is a man who Carpenter can work his hatred of the end of the Reagan era out with. So how did he decide to make that into a movie from a major studio? Television.""I began watching TV again,"" Carpenter told Hero Complex. ""I quickly realized that everything we see is designed to sell us something. It's all about wanting us to buy something. The only thing they want to do is take our money.""Carpenter also saw the story in Alien Encounters, a comic book that Nelson appeared in, rewriting his tale and working with artist Bill Wray. He acquired the film rights to both the comic book and short story and wrote the screenplay himself.Carpenter made the movie for $3 million and selected Piper because he looked like he had lived a life. Keith David's part was written just for him, as Carpenter had enjoyed working with him on The Thing.Nada's name means, of course, nothing. He has nothing, he has no one and yet, he is the man that humanity must rely upon when facing an enemy that is already us. When he views the world through special glasses, he can see the messages that the unseen they have kept hidden from us for so long.How long? Why? And to what end? Well, look. This is an exploitation picture through and through. You can see it from the left - that's where Carpenter seems to be coming from - as the aliens are terraforming our world through pollution and global warming. Or maybe you can see this as the original fake news if you've on the other side.This is a film with both a sad and happy ending. I guess you can just call it a John Carpenter ending, a place where tough men see a middle finger until the closing curtain as the only way to end up on the winner's side of the balance sheet.Despite being critically savaged - you can xerox that line for nearly every post-Halloween Carpenter movie - time has been beyond kind to this movie, which seems more and more based on real life and less a work of fiction.This Alan Hynes poster is amazing.There's been a lot made of the fact that Roddy Piper claimed that this movie was based on fact. He'd bring up - it's on the commentary track he did - that in the 1950s, a company manufactured a TV that planted subliminal messages in women's brains and he'd seen a doc about it. Well, he may have seen that movie, but he didn't realize that L'affaire Bronswik was a parody.Speaking of different groups seeing this movie in their own light, several white supremacist groups have taken to this film as an allegory for how Jewish people run the world. Carpenter even responded to this on Twitter by saying, ""They Live is about yuppies and unrestrained capitalism. It has nothing to do with Jewish control of the world, which is slander and a lie.""",They Live
17,Coventry,"Terrific concept, mildly disappointing execution",6,17 December 2007,"""They Live"" benefices, without exaggerating, from one of the greatest basic horror/Sci-Fi premises ever, but regrettably enough the wholesome doesn't even rank as one of the greatest movies of the 80's decade. The idea of highly intellectual alien having taken over the world, gradually incorporating the wealthier social classes and inconspicuously oppressing the remaining humans with subliminal advertisements is fantastic (at least, in my humble opinion), but sadly the execution too much revolves on spectacle instead of suspense and the whole thing quickly reverts to an almost ordinary fistfight & shootout action movie. This was to be expected with a wrestling star in the lead role, but still it's somewhat unfortunate to witness how overlong action footage has to compensate for more thorough plotting possibilities. Halfway through the film, for example, there's a fight between Roddy Piper and Keith David that goes on for nearly ten minutes, yet the only purpose of this scene is for Piper to convince his pal to wear the special sunglasses and see the world how it really is. The setting is California around the turn of the Century, late 1990's, and Piper stars as John Nada, an unemployed construction worker who moved from Detroit and befriends a few people at the campsite where he finds a new home. Life as he knew it drastically changes finding a box of sunglasses that reveal the painful truth: the rich people in the streets and on TV are skeletal aliens disguised as humans and we're continuously surrounded with billboards spreading eerie commands such as ""Obey"", ""Consume"" and ""Marry & Reproduce"". Nada and his friend Frank (Keith David) subsequently join an underground movement and join the battle against the aliens, but they are super powerful and everywhere. The 20 minutes, namely the scenes prior to Nada's discovery, are slow but very atmospheric as John Carpenter clearly suggests there's something very wrong; only you have no idea what exactly. The sequences of the world as seen through the sun goggles are shown in creepy black and white, but this effect is overused and rapidly loses its impact. In fact, the B&W is genuinely creepy just once, when Nada finds himself surrounded by skeleton-faced aliens inside a supermarket. The plot continuously gets sillier and fairly large holes begin to appear near the end, but since Carpenter clearly always seems to indicate that we shouldn't it all TOO seriously, ""They Live"" nonetheless remains a fun and memorable genre effort.",They Live

20,hitchcockthelegend,Life's a bitch and she's back on heat!,8,12 June 2013,"They Live is directed by John Carpenter who also adapts the screenplay form the short story Eight O'Clock in the Morning written by Ray Nelson. It stars Roddy Piper, Keith David and Meg Foster. Music is by Alan Howarth (and Carpenter) and cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe.Unemployed drifter Nada (Piper) wanders into the city looking to find work, but upon finding a unique pair of sunglasses he sees a different world to everyone else. It's a world frequented by an alien race who are using the Earth for their own nefarious means.See The Truth!Carpenter does subversive sci-fi and it's a whole bunch of fun. Stripped back it's evident that They Live is Carpenter's wry observation on the politico posers who endorse the rich getting richer and everybody else sliding down the pole; to where they stop nobody knows! It's also a blatant paean to the glorious years of the 1950s when paranoia based sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features ruled the air waves. It's also a wonderfully macho driven action movie, laced with comedy as well. You can rest assured there will be plenty of shooting, punching, dodging and spoken lines to make you smile.Piper is no Kurt Russell, but we shouldn't hold that against him because he fills the role nicely. With muscular frame, 80s hair and a quip on the tongue, he is most assuredly a Carpenter leading man for the 80s. Alongside him is the reassuring presence of Keith David, himself a beefcake and also one of the coolest muthas on the planet. It's easy to believe that these two can save the planet, even after nearly beating each other to a pulp during a prolonged side-alley fight sequence, where Carpenter doesn't miss a chance to parody professional wrestling. While away from the beef, Meg Foster gets the lead lady role, with those amazing eyes nestling in perfectly with the world Carpenter has created.Carpenter does political? Yes, but it's not the be all and end all of his intentions. He wanted to make an action sci-fi schlocker with sly politico undertones as motives. And that's exactly what he did. Joyously so. 8/10",They Live
21,Theo Robertson,Silliness Ruins Premise,6,17 June 2002,"This has a really good persausive idea that aliens from another dimension are infiltrating the Earth and colonising it through the media , politics and free market economics. With globalization and neo liberalism being the political words coming out of radical mouths at the start of this century how can a film like THEY LIVE fail ? Well it seems not too difficult to ruin the premise , all you have to do is camp it up , have a really overlong and pointless punch up between two of the characters, underdevelop the pollution aspect of the conspiracy , and have a laughably silly final scene . Hard to imagine that Carpenter made the bleak and ultra downbeat THE THING a mere six years before. Mind you PRINCE OF DARKNESS was absolutely dour and humourless and perhaps fearing another box office flop Carpenter decided to inject a lot more humour into this project to give it more appeal , bad idea . But that`s not to say THEY LIVE is a major disaster , it`s not but with so many great and topical ideas involved it should have been much better .Trivia point: Arch conspiracy theorist David Icke has made a fortune writing and lecturing on the theory that shape shifting lizards from another dimension are behind globalization . They are doing this by taking control of this planet`s banking systems , industrial bases , governments , and media. If I was Icke I`d be more worried about John Carpenter`s lawyers than about shape shifting lizards from another dimension",They Live
22,Hey_Sweden,"""The golden rule: he who has the gold makes the rules.""",7,16 January 2015,"Interesting and relevant entertainment from John Carpenter stars wrestling icon ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper as beefy drifter ""Nada"", who arrives in an L.A. of a near future where the gulf separating social classes has become stronger than ever. Enjoying the hospitality of a community for homeless folks, he inadvertently discovers the strange truth: aliens are among us. Their real visages and subliminal messages are only visible when a person puts on special sunglasses, designed by a resistance movement. The aliens are in collusion with the most affluent people on Earth to keep the lower classes in a state of submission while they take advantage of our planets' resources.Ultimately, ""They Live"" turns into a fairly conventional urban action flick, but it's certainly got some good ideas going for it. Carpenter, using a pseudonym, adapted the story ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning"" by Ray Nelson, and gives us a thoughtful meditation on how people can be manipulated by those that have all the power and influence, and a scathing indictment of the Reagan era 1980s.""Rowdy"" Roddy acquits himself well in the lead, and delivers an amiable performance. His dialogue is full of some choice quips. He's joined by the eternally cool Keith David, who's working with Carpenter for the first time since 1982s' ""The Thing"". Meg Foster is fine at portraying a beautiful but aloof woman whom Roddy continually encounters. Two Carpenter regulars, George ""Buck"" Flower and Peter Jason, have two of their best roles with him. Raymond St. Jacques is commanding as a blind preacher; other familiar faces in the cast include Sy Richardson, Susan Barnes, Norman Alden, and John F. Goff.Carpenter composes another of his catchy electronic scores, and continues to make full use of the Panavision aspect ratio. Some of the best shots have both the homeless community and towering office buildings in the frame, quite literally showing two different worlds at once. The makeup on the aliens, admittedly, is pretty damn silly.Of course, no summary of ""They Live"" is complete without mentioning one of the most epic of protracted fight scenes (between Roddy and Keith); every time you think it's over, it starts up again!All in all, a solid entry in Carpenters' filmography that both amuses the viewer and provides some food for thought.Seven out of 10.",They Live

24,poolandrews,A great Sci-Fi horror film with a strong message.,8,23 September 2005,"They Live starts with struggling labourer Nada (Roddy Piper) who drifts into Los Angeles & finds work on a building site. With nowhere to sleep fellow construction operative Frank (Keith David) offers to show him the way to a basic camp for the homeless. While there Nada notices some strange activity in a nearby church involving a blind preacher (Raymond St. Jacques), Gilbert (Peter Jason) the campsites leader & a guy with a beard (John Lawrence) who keeps hacking the signal from Cable 54 so he can get on telly to preach his weird theories. Nada also witnesses the local police raid the church & destroy the campsite, upon closer inspection of the church ruins Nada finds a box full of sunglasses. However, these are not ordinary sunglasses as they allow the wearer to 'see' aliens that have infiltrated our society & their mind controlling techniques. With the help of Frank & the few remaining revolutionary's, Nada sets out to expose the alien race before it's too late & Earth is completely taken over!Written under the pseudonym 'Frank Armitage' & directed by John Carpenter They Live is a unique film that almost works to perfection, almost. The script obviously has heavy social & political overtones, the rich & powerful join forces with the aliens whom promise wealth & protection. While the idea of society being control & brainwashed through the use of subliminal messaging, TV, magazines & billboards is unnervingly all to plausible considering the barrage of imagery that we see each & every day of our lives. The first half of They Live really plays on this & works extremely well, unfortunately the second half plays more like the standard Sci-Fi/action/horror film that you may have expected with various shoot-outs, fights, revolutionary's, silly special effects & alien technology taking over & dominating the proceedings. Having said that They Live moves along at a good pace & never becomes dull or boring & both aspects of the story, the action & the subtle social commentary, are engaging & entertain as the alien plan unfolds on screen. There are very few character's in They Live as the story is told almost entirely through Nada's (which means 'nothing' in Spanish, so now you know!) perspective as They Live also takes a nice swipe at how self obsessed & selfish modern society is. Things become a bit silly at the end with watches that make people disappear, various unlikely coincidences & it felt too rushed as if Carpenter didn't quite know what do do with the ideas. With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 They Live is technically a pretty decent film, the widescreen cinematography is fine, the music is easy going & as a whole it's very well made throughout. The aliens look a bit odd & for the most part are only ever shown in black and white, the violence & gore is as restrained as it gets with a few gunshot wounds & a cool five & a half minute fight between Nada & Frank. The acting is OK but nothing outstanding, Piper does a more than acceptable job considering his wrestling background although I'm not sure about that hair style! Meg Foster turns up as the love interest Holly Thompson but despite her near top-billing in the credits has very little screen time. I liked They Live a lot, I thought it was an original & somewhat brave piece of film-making from John Carpenter that works very well for most of it's 90 odd minute duration. A great film & a must watch for all horror/Sci-Fi/John Carpenter fans alike!",They Live

It has a cult following but it deserves wider recognition. The script is smart and actually has something to say, unlike most popcorn flicks. The cast is terrific, particularly ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper in easily his best movie role. He gets lots of funny and memorable lines. His professional wrestling background comes in handy, too, as he and Keith David have the greatest fight scene in movie history here.

27,zardoz-13,One of Carpenter's Lesser Epics,7,11 October 2012,"""Halloween"" helmer John Carpenter must have run out of dough while he was making ""They Live"" with Rodney Piper, Meg Foster, and Keith David. This enigmatic, alien invasion thriller about deception and mind-control unfolds with urgency, developing the dysptopian world that our brawny hero must negotiate carefully to survive. Nada (Rodney Piper) walks out of a railway tunnel at the outset and enters sprawling Los Angeles. Eventually, he finds work on a construction crew and takes up residence in a makeshift camp. The residents sit around and watch television. Occasionally another weaker signal interferes with Cable Channel 54, but little about these bootleg transmissions makes sense to anybody. Nada becomes best friends with Frank (Keith David) who helped him get a job on the construction crew. One day Nada investigates a nearby Catholic Church and discovers that the choir warbles their songs from a tape recorder. A group of resistance members use the church as their headquarters from which they beam out a signal.Things really begin to happen when our hero finds a cardboard box brimming with huge, wraparound sunglasses. When he slips them on, wearing them is akin to staring through an X-ray machine. Nada is horrified to learn that Earth has been invaded by aliens, and these extraterrestrials have gradually taken over society, subdued nations, and are working with quislings to uproot any remaining pockets of resistance. Nada tries to get Frank to slip on the spectacles, but he refuses. These two guys battle each other as if they were titans in a smackdown in an ally. When it appears that the fight can go no longer, Nada surprises Frank and takes him down. Frank reacts with similar horror after he sees what is really happening. Messages about procreation, watching television, obeying, and others populate the landscape. Humans look at them and cannot see the message without the glasses. These two hellions embark on a crusade. They encounter a resident from the makeshift camp (Buck Flowers) who has sold out to the aliens. Along the way, they have a running battle with the authorities who are trying to wipe out the last vestiges of resistance. Early in the action, Nada takes a hostage (Meg Foster) and believes erroneously that she is sympathetic to the cause. He performs one hell of a header from her apartment.The chief problem with ""They Live"" is that it has a downer of an ending. Our heroes never confront an alien leader. They blast away at alien soldiers but they never learn much about the occupying aliens, except that resistance is futile. Of course, this doesn't prevent Nada and Frank from carrying out their mission. When our heroes don their sunglasses, they can differentiate between the aliens and the humans. Humans appear normal when peering at them through the glasses. The aliens, however, look like ghouls with hockey masks and their faces and bodies are dappled. Just when it looks like our heroes are about to make a difference, ""They Live"" ends on an inconsequential note. Apparently, this is the kind of supernatural, science fiction saga where the aliens triumph over humanity. Carpenter makes our heroes sympathetic, while the aliens are unsightly. Actually, ""They Live"" qualifies as one of Carpenter's lesser efforts. The aliens are too cryptic and the heroes aren't heroic enough. Finally, ""They Live"" ends up as a disappointment. The orchestral soundtrack that Carpenter composed is atmospheric. Meg Foster makes a superb alien.",They Live
28,Boba_Fett1138,John Carpenter's alien invasion movie.,8,4 April 2011,"As far as alien invasion movies go; this one has got to be one of the most original ones out there.This movie made me realize how much I'm missing the 'old' John Carpenter, even though I'm not even a big fan of just all of his early work. His last truly good movie dates back from the early '90's. He seems to have lost his touch off lately and his recent movies also seem to lack relevance. Early Carpenter movies always meant something and had a deeper underlying meaning to them, as this movie also does for instance.You could say that this movie is being more of a social commentary and satire than a serious straight-forward science-fiction flick. And I like the movie for that! Luckily it really doesn't take itself too serious and also deliberately goes over the top at times. If you look at this movie too seriously, it will come across as a very silly and perhaps even lazy written movie. Really not that much gets explained and lots of stuff simply doesn't make sense. But yet as a social commentary of its era it really manages to work out very well. The aliens in this movie aren't here to conquer the Earth or to steal or women but they are here to get rich fast, over the backs of the mindless consumers living on Earth. Everything in this movie is a clear statement against capitalism and just the Reagan-era in general and I must say its done in an amusing and creative way, without ever becoming too ridicules as a movie.It's definitely a movie with lots of cult potential, which makes it a shame that this movie is any better known than Carpenter's other work. As most other Carpenter movies, this one is being made with limited resources, which forces it to become creative and to come up with ways to stand out, without having to feature any spectacular or big moments. Like often, he does this with his characters as well as with a whole bunch of subtle little moments.It's funny how the main character is blowing away every alien that comes in his sight, without asking any questions about what they want or why they are here. He has no moral problems with it, even though the aliens are all human looking and acting. This is also what I often like about Carpenter movies. He is not afraid to show any violence and to make his main 'heroes' some tough, over-the-top, action heroes, that you are always yet capable of relating to.The main character in this movie is being played by professional wrestler Roddy Piper, who really fits the role well and even manages to act his way through the movie. Of course he also gets to show some of his wrestling skills, though he's mostly using some big guns throughout the movie, as does the always likable Keith David.Even though the story to some will come across as simplistic, it actually is one that has some really clever moments in it. I for instance liked how the movie fooled you a couple of times with who were going to be the good and bad guys within the movie.Something that also makes this movie stand out and memorable are the looks of the aliens, that only can be seen when wearing special sunglasses or contact lenses. They are really ugly and grotesque looking, though all you see of them are their faces and its effects for it aren't even that convincing looking.An unique movie for sure, especially to be enjoyed by the fans of John Carpenter's early work.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",They Live

Piper being in the role didn't bother me, and he does just fine. David and he are awesome in this. The acting is never below average. The plot is marvelous, and develops nicely throughout. I can also vouch for the high quality of the short story that this was based on, and I certainly would suggest it to anyone who enjoys this, and vice versa. I won't detail the idea, and would say that going into this without knowing it is a good way to do the initial viewing. There are grand surprises and twists in this. The sense of humor is bad-ass. The dialog, including the one-liners, is all well-delivered. The pacing is spot-on. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are quite nice, if dated by todays standards, and they arguably were never as well-done as they could have been, with a larger budget, but that's part of the charm, and they work well.

30,view_and_review,Read This Review,8,1 October 2019,"Submit. Obey. Consume.Those were a few of the hidden messages that were hidden in plain sight in They Live. I thought I could make a similar message the title of my review. If you're reading this then I think it worked.Nada (Rowdy Roddy Piper) is an itinerant laborer that has found his way to California. He's in need of a job, food, and shelter. He finds all three, but the shelter is more like a homeless camp. The camp he's holed up in is across the street from a church that seems to be active all hours of the day. When Nada visits said church he finds that it is more of a headquarters for something.When the church is evacuated Nada goes back to find a box of sunglasses. They must be special if there's a box of them. They are. With these sunglasses on he can see all of the hidden messages around the city: ""No independent thought."" ""This is your god."" ""Obey,"" and other messages. What's more, he sees that some people are not really people at all; they're some kind of humanoid with the skin missing from their faces. It was at this point Nada ""woke up,"" but now he has to do something.One thing he did was recruit his coworker and camp-mate, Frank (Keith David). But before that, he decided he would take out a few of these aliens himself. My favorite scene is when he walked into a bank with two guns and said, ""I've come to chew bubble gum and kick ass and I'm all out of bubble gum."" That has to be one of the best lines in movie history. It was brilliant.Clearly, the premise of the movie is that we've become sheep. Through television and consumerism we all lead a life in which we are asleep just following the commands given to us. Of course, in They Live our commands come from an alien race that has found a way to brainwash us with hidden messages. Who knows, maybe that is the reality. Something like The Matrix but not digital, which is why I like this movie so much. I loved The Matrix and this is the prelude to that.

Nada tries to convince the world of this fact, without much success, though he later joins a resistance group, after becoming a fugitive.Clever and satiric film works well for the most part, because it contains lots of thoughtful ideas about the world we lived in then - and now!

Key scenes yes, but the film as a whole, no.Piper is an odd choice for the lead, but he looks like your typical white collar American who struggles to make ends meet.

The guy was the best at making horror films and remaking them in the case of ""The Thing"". Here he made a very good film about a guy who finds some sunglasses that allow him to see some very strange things. I enjoyed this plot as it reminds me of a Dean Koontz story called Twilight Eyes, as in that one only certain people could see these strange creatures and in this one sunglasses allow a person to see the world as it really is as there are some strange looking people out there to be revealed when these special sunglasses are put on. There is also a Stephen King story where people who smoke can actually see things, but it may have come after this film was released. This one stars Roddy Piper of WWE fame, my guess is that Kurt Russell was busy with another project as he was generally John Carpenter's guy during this time. Do not fear though, as Carpenter is able to get another of his faves in this in the form of George Buck Flower. Piper does a commendable job as he is certainly a much better actor than most wrestlers during this era as this film is good while Hulk Hogan made steaming pile of crap after steaming pile of crap during the 80's, 90's and beyond. Piper being in this film also sets up one of the longest fight scenes between two guys I have ever seen and it was a rather good back alley brawl that was literally in the back alley. Meg Foster was also in this film and she was annoying, but then she was supposed to be. The ending was funny in a way and though I hated to see the lead guy end up the way he did, he did manage to get a good one off.",They Live

But that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. Roddy Piper, the WWF wrestler, plays a drifter who stumbles upon a huge secret: the powerful elite on Earth are really aliens who exploit the working man. They are disguised as people, but with a pair of special sunglasses, he can see which ones are which. Without a second's worth of questioning, he grabs a shotgun and starts blasting away at every one of the ugly s.o.b.'s. It's silly, but entertainingly so. As an action picture, it's serviceable. Unfortunately, there are long stretches where nothing much happens, and it takes forever for the plot to start moving, instead treating the whole thing as a mystery for about a half-hour, which Carpenter executes badly. By the time Piper starts to see the aliens, I was the only person of four watching it left awake.",They Live

I remember watching this when I was young, and like any other movie of John Carpenter I liked it. But now after so many years rewatching this movie didn't give me the same joy as in the past. For that the negative points are too overwhelming and by that I mean the terrible script (the lines in this movie are pretty dumb), the acting is also pretty bad (even for a movie from that time), and the action scenes look so fake (let's just say nowadays we know how to do this better). That said I still enjoyed the story, even after all those years, it's still relevant for our modern society, so it is worth watching, but the quality of all the things mentioned above is just below average and that's too bad. I normally don't like remakes but in this case I think they should remake this movie.",They Live

It probably helps in that regard to cast a pro wrestler as your main hero, stop the movie dead in its tracks with an insane back-alley brawl and pepper the movie with one-liners that are just the right flavor of cheese. Indeed, that whole stretch from the discovery of the sunglasses to that alley fight is some B cinema of the highest quality.

I don't share the director's admiration for the guy but teamed with Keith David things move along well enough. And then they have a fight because David won't try the sunglasses that Piper has found and have such an affect on ones perception of the world. Apparently there are four blank pages in the original script, representing the fight and it took some four days to shoot. It also seems to go on for four minutes, which is a lot of scree time. Its well enough done, some say one of the best but is unnecessarily protracted and certainly when I started to loose a little interest. The action afterwards is less introspective than that before and there is more fighting and running about in tunnels as the films becomes something of a cross between an 80s computer game and Star Trek. I had to stop myself laughing out loud at the teleportation scene but maybe the director intended a bit of light relief. Either way, for me, silliness takes over and what might have been some dystopian tragedy turns into farce.",They Live

41,KineticSeoul,A cult classic masterpiece,10,12 January 2017,"This is one of those movies that is simple and yet has quite a bit of depth to it. In fact the depth when it comes to the social commentary in this is quite effective and yet entertaining to watch. This is one of my favorite John Carpenter film that really got my attention even when watching it as a kid. The societal study of covert factious regime is the main factor at it's core that drives this story. With deep messages on being blinded by the media, entertainment and what politicians has to say. All are manifestations created by aliens to subdue and control the human race. It's actually compelling. Sure it has the B movie vibe going for it and can be corny at times but the corniness actually makes this more of a fun ride. Instead of it being overly serious and dark, it's corny and yet ingenious. I also liked it's portrayal of how the poor are quicker to see things for they really are. While the rich and people with status only care about controlling others and taking advantage of people. And only does things when there is something in it for them. So I found it ironic when most of the aliens were people that work in the entertainment industry, media coverage and politics. The subtle parts when the characters get headaches when they see and hear the truth for a period of time to add to the satire. Even one of the scenes that show a long fight between two friends near a dumpster has a meaning to it. Because the main protagonist is trying with all his might for his friend to see the truth for what it really is. And how society lacks integrity and can easily be bribed for position of power and wealth. While succumbing to turning a blind eye to the truth in the process. So overall, this is a movie I would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys films in general and not just science fiction fans. Because before ""The Matrix"" there was this cult classic masterpiece. 10/10",They Live

John Carpenter's cult sci-fi / action is fresh, tip-top entertainment packing ballsy action, shade wearing, Roddy Piper, elastic dialogues that are just so memorable (""I've come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass""), Keith David, aliens in human disguise and cryptic messages. But what makes it has got to be Piper and David's very long-winded beat down, which is rather bruising to watch. I heard that it went on and on and on and boy, they weren't wrong. ""Put on those sunglasses or start eating that trashcan!"". Should have listened to the man. Priceless.The innovative plot (adapted off a short story) starts off like something out of a Larry Cohen feature, as the story sets-up a commentary about social importance (""We'll do anything to be rich"") and urban plight featuring the poor / working class with an alien spin to it all. It's a hidden façade (numbing our senses, so they can influence decisions and control lives without anyone really knowing). But then it settles down with its glum paranoid air, novelty images and gut-busting action, but the dialogues always remains biting -- Piper as a drifter discovers there are aliens hiding amongst us when comes across some special sunnies and then he intends to show them up. Carpenter's style is full of energy, showing so with the funky soundtrack and sweeping camera-work. After a cruise-like beginning, the momentum picks up and then never surrenders. The boisterous action is caught with such dynamic verve and is tautly staged with certain toughness. The performances are all suitable; Piper and David are likable as our heroes.

43,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Pleasantly surprising sci-fi actioner,9,29 December 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits John Nada ('Rowdy' Roddy Piper) is an unemployed labourer who drifts into a small town and manages to blag himself a job on a construction site. After a bit of racial tension and macho posturing, he makes a new friend in Frank (Keith David). Frank lives in a sort of trailer park in the middle of corporate America, that the world's richest nation would rather you didn't know about. There's also a TV there that is interrupted with messages telling how the world around them is really a front by aliens to control our minds and make us obey their commands. It's also constantly raided by heavily armed, brutal riot police. There's also a stash of fancy-looking sunglasses in a box. One day, probably just wanting to look cool, John tries a pair on, only to see funny alien faces on certain people and billboards and other mind control substances get decoded for what they really are. Rather than laying off the acid, John comes to realize that the interrupting broadcasts on TV are true and that he and the rest of those who are on to the big conspiracy must band together to stop it, rather than going it on his own and looking like a totally psycho, demented nutter.I've seen a few other of Roddy Piper's works and with him being a former wrestler and all I was expecting this to just be a light bit of switch your brain off fun. But I seemed to forget it's also directed by John Carpenter and the surprisingly intelligent, inventive film I was greeted with, rather than giving me a bit of harmless fun, made me wonder why on the back of this Piper didn't get a bigger big screen career rather than just making a lot of DTV movies.The film was made 20 years after Night of the Living Dead, and at first glance many of the ideas (the interrupted TV broadcasts in particular) may seem to be stolen from that film, but it's better to see it as a spin-off of that film rather than a rip-off, even as an update, bringing the concept to a more modern audience. It even borrows the commentary on consumerism from George Romero's Dawn of the Dead and updates that.Carpenter is apparently also a huge wrestling fan, so there's also a huge (but rather pointless) scene in the film where Piper and David wrestle that has impressive chereography if nothing else. As the lead hero, Piper actually doesn't have much going for him here, dry and kind of bland but David is impressive support, well suited as an action co-star.Piper and Carpenter are kind of an odd mix, and given his rather lacklustre performance, it's obvious that it was Carpenter's love of wrestling that cast Piper in the lead role, but as a clever Carpenter film, he controls it all the way, cheap, cheesy special effects and all. Very impressive. ****",They Live

This leads to a slow first half that ultimately drags down the much more fun and ostentatious sequences that come later on. When it works, it works well and is an entertaining pseudo-exploitation flick with some great fight-scenes - including a fantastically unnecessary, surprisingly brutal yet slightly camp alleyway brawl over a pair of sunglasses - and a proper sense of its underlying satirical humour.

It's basically a masterpiece of a B-movie. In B-movie terms... this is the 'Godfather' Parts 1, 2 and 3.We join a vagrant (played by a wrestler no less!) who stumbles onto an alien plot to take over the world. He decides that ain't gonna' happen! And he does it in style.I could mention the numerous classic (yet completely cheesy) lines.

The concept of the film is interesting, but it's so low-budget as to almost resemble a home movie project.On the other hand, all of that has camp value, and director John Carpenter also gives us quite a few moral messages that are still highly relevant 30 years later: beware of the mass media controlling you via its messaging ('Conform', 'Submit', 'Don't Read', etc). Beware of people being made wealthy by selling out their morals, and joining an untouchable elite. Beware of unbridled capitalism. Heck, even beware of those changing the planet's climate. Wake up people, says Carpenter. All of this is at the hands of aliens who can only be seen by wearing sunglasses somehow developed by an underground resistance, but the social commentary is clear.

It was a little disappointing for me since I have played Duke Nukem: Time to Kill from childhood and thought it was all his own words but, unfortunately I was in that regard.Anyways I thought Roddy Piper was an excellent and badass actor. I honestly didn't know he was a wrestler until I've seen his IMDb page and unfortunately, he died last year from cardiac arrest. He does resemble a lot of Duke Nukem, except for the long hair. Man, himself and Keith David were beating the hell outta of each other for around 10 minutes (well it did felt like that long really) all because the reason of getting David's character in wearing a pair of those sunglasses! Even though I liked the movie, I was rather annoyed at some of the scenes. I would have loved to see Piper alive in the end instead being shot by the alien cops and getting the girl without her betraying him. I would love to have seen themselves a couple since he is the 'good guy' after all! I didn't like the fact Keith David was his sidekick, it's just I think Nada would be better off on his own. I actually would've liked to have seen him use a bulletproof vest too like, it would give him more power and destruction into killing the aliens.

49,CuriosityKilledShawn,...we sleep.,7,1 October 2006,"Almost every John Carpenter flick is cult, or underrated, or a sleeper. It seems that audiences never truly ""get"" his films until long after their release. Only now are people warming slightly to Escape From L.A.They Live is no exception. It takes forever to get going and has hardly any dialogue. But remember, I'm talking from the angle of someone who lives in an era where there is always an explosion in the first ten minutes, just to interest the audience.Taken from a short story, Eight O'Clock In The Morning, the film focuses on John Nada (Roddy Piper), a drifter, who comes to L.A. in search of work. After scrounging a job at a construction site, he stays in a shantytown, run by Gilbert (Peter Jason), and becomes friendly with Frank (Keith David). After a while, he reckons that Gilbert is up to no good, as he is always disappearing into the gospel church across the street, and is reluctant to spill the beans too easily.Nada gets the feeling that something's not quite right. And so do we. Only we can't figure out what. Then the fuzz show up and lay waste to the shantytown. Nada just stands there and watches, looking totally confused. Next day, he raids the church, only to find boxes of sunglasses. He swipes one and when he wears it, not only does he see in black-and-white, but the world isn't quite the same. Ads and billboards tell him to ""Eat"", ""Sleep"" or ""Marry And Reproduce"". Magazines say nothing but ""No Independent Thought"" and ""Do Not Question Authority"". But, most distressingly, some humans do not look human in the least. They have big bulging eyes, with purple skull-heads. Naturally, Nada is freaked out.Everything rests on his shoulders. He hardly ever speaks, yet the story is told through his eyes. We know what he knows only by reaction and facial expression. It's a difficult role and yet Piper handles is pretty good. Although the dialogue is pure exposition, Carpenter never fully presents us, or Nada, with a threatening situation.Obviously, the non-humans are aliens. But, like the tagline says, who are they, and what do they want? It seems like they want to rule the world and exploit the working class, but that's the way things are anyhow. Apparently, they lead ordinary lives. If they weren't around, then someone would still be running the show, probably in the exact same way.It is because of this that Nada's sudden desire to go on an alien killing spree is too much to handle. Carpenter fails to make much of the movie after this. Meg Foster's character is almost totally irrelevant and extraneous. She serves no purpose. The prolonged fight scene between Nada and Frank is supposed to be funny, but simply isn't. It just feels odd and the comedy doesn't come through. I guess Carpenter let this scene go because Piper had a lot of wrestling experience and it might be a good idea to film a less fake-looking fight with him. Although Nada and Frank are friends, the reason for them to beat the crap out of each is stupid and not ironic at all.The ending is a bit abrupt, but the director has never been one for indulgence. It's a good ending though and it will make you laugh, which is fortunate, because you're hardly likely to smile much in the second half.Interesting, but not up to the standard of Carpenter's earlier work.",They Live

Roddy Piper plays a homeless drifter whom discovers the reason for the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor in the world when finding himself a box of glasses in a church. When he put on the sunglasesses, he can see that aliens truth faces and notice they have infiltrated society in diguises of wealthy yuppies. He sees through their subliminal messages in media outlooks such as books, magazine, billboards and television such as words like obey and don't question. The use of black and white whenever John puts on the glasses, give the word, a 1950's B-movie look as well, as tribute to them. I can't help thinking it's a Twilight Zone episode. The black and white also gives the movie, totalitarian look at it, as if watching fascism era footage. He soon joins the counter culture in a revolution to stop the invasion. Roddy was great in the role, he had such a rich and textured character in this film. His performance is still one of the more underrated and meaningful in a science-fiction film because it deals with something we live with every day, advertising and authority, and to not let either rule you. It's about being your own boss, and live life the way you want. Rather than looking not normal like Hulk Hogan, Piper doesn't looks like a WWE guy, but a regular Joe who stand under the moral: nothing wrong with a hard day's work. He starts to see not only does the aliens hold a threat, but common human beings whom sold themselves out for greed. I think most people miss the over-all deeper message of the movie. No the evil in this world is not aliens from another planet, but the men and women who let greed rule them and would step on anyone for wealth. TV, advertising, and mainstream news does make people ""sleep"" or rather get dumbed down. We are manipulated on a daily basis as we are their slaves. America was based on the idea that everyone has an equal chance but this is just no longer the case, that's what set off Piper into fighting them. Pipers starts to quote one-liners only to feed how badass the character is. Some of them are good, some of them come out of nowhere. ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all outta bubblegum."" he quotes on the run, what kind of person says that when cops are chasing him. Shouldn't he not be public light at this point. Piper enlisted co-worker Frank (Keith David) after the world's longest fist fight over nothing. No, really. This scene was only suppose to be 20 secs, but John Carperter like the fight so much, he put the whole fight scene in. Carpenter allows 5 minutes of gratuitous Piper-David eye-gouging, an apparent bone to wrestling fans. The fight is brutal, and both characters nearly killed each other just because Frank is too proud to try on the magic dark glasses. It is completely stupid. Man, that guy is the worst sunglasses sellsman I've ever seen. Both men happen to stumbles (literally) into the scope of how big this reality of a galactic-size conspiracy when they find their secret base and a rich guy who show them throughout the base and how to stop them. He tells him, that it turns out those darn aliens are just intergalactic free enterprisers doing a little cross-worlds exploitation of our natural resources because the Earth is just another Third World to them. The media and the human power elite buy into this exploitation -- for them, it's just business as usual. All that information, for what reason. Why because he mistakes them for millionaires despite Roddy and Keith not wearing suits, looking dirty, and out of place. Come on, Carpenter, that's probably one of the most sloppy writing I ever saw. It's seem rush. On the way, both men meet up with one of the most scariest actor I ever saw in dimensional doppelganger of Kristie Alley, Meg Foster. She reads out the lines, barely giving out an emotion depth to it at all, and somehow she end up as the love interest to Roddy's character. She got what she deserve in the end of the movie, so look forward to that. This satire of Reaganomics and the ""greed is good"" era is a great genre picture with a clever subtext. John Carpenter still tells a story better than his contemporaries. His heroes are more interesting. He's a master of mood and timing, which probably comes from his instincts as a musician.

53,The-Sarkologist,A movie that exposes our fear of freedom,8,16 December 2013,"I remember watching this movie a long time ago (basically when I was a kid) and I really liked it. Recently every time I see it I state that it is a brilliant movie, but nobody really seems to listen to me regarding this movie so I hired it and my judgement still stands. Even though it is a B-grade science-fiction movie, it is actually quite good.Basically the world is going through economic hardships and many people are loosing their jobs, but the rich seem to still be living a luxurious lifestyle. A guy comes into Los Angeles looking for work, and finds some, but stumbles upon an organisation that seems to be attracting the police's attention. After a particularly nasty raid, he decides to investigate further and steals a box which he discovers contains sunglasses. Rather annoyed at this find, he ditches the box but keeps a pair and puts it on for a shock - everything contains subliminal messages and a number of people look horrid. We learn that the horrid people are actually aliens that have made a pact with the power elite on earth.Basically this movie seems to have a huge social commentary attached to it. Earth in this film is a third-world country and our power-elite have sold out to these aliens. We are simply a planet with resources worth exploiting and these creatures have made deals with us to get these resources. Money is the thing that entices us so they give us lots of money and take what they want. One statement in the movie is that it is easy to sell out because all we want is money.The key is a statement made at the beginning: when we are born we are told that we have to succeed and then the person who tells us tries to rip us apart to succeed himself. This movie creates a bleak and empty world were everybody emotionlessly pursues money, while those who do not have the fortune to be in the wealthy social class must struggle to survive. The places we visit here are the wealthy district and the shanty towns where the poor and the wretched hide and struggle to survive.It is interesting to see how people sell out. Basically the wealthy do not see a problem with these aliens, but when the guy sees the truth through the sunglasses, he realises that we are all being manipulated by subliminal messages that are everywhere. The only reason we do not see what the signs really say is that there is a transmission that hides everything. The goal in the movie is not to wipe out the aliens - that cannot be done - but to reveal the truth to everybody, and thus they must wipe out the tower. The wealthy don't want that to happen because they have everything already - freedom does not matter when they have freedom with money.I guess there is also the idea of subliminal advertising, but this is not really the thrust of it, but that we are being to controlled to think and do what we do, and if it is socially unacceptable then we must be reprogrammed. We are programmed by everything that we look at, and in the movie there are subliminal messages, but we do not need a movie to tell us that advertising programs us. Humanity basically needs to be told what to do because most people don't like to think or make a choice, as such they look elsewhere for their decisions to be made.This is a good movie and it is very socially damning. I have seen movies that are much more so, but this basically strikes at our nature, the desire for wealth and power and will give up our freedom and our thoughts to obtain it.",They Live

So happy to own a collector's edition of They Live, very much worth it! Quite unique and wonderful film!",They Live
55,paulclaassen,This...was...so...boring...,2,12 June 2020,"John Carpenter has made some incredible movies over the years, and off course some not so great. 'They Live' falls in the latter category.Regarded as one of the great 80s horror films, I don't regard 'They Live' either great or a horror. The only horror was having to sit through a film labelled as a horror, but where very little happens. The action (and I'm referring here to something of interest happening) is few and far between. All that actually happens, is the hero, Nada (played by wrestling superstar Roddy Piper) looking through his glasses and shooting aliens.Uhm, why should I root for Nada? Why is he killing these aliens, that have lived in peace among us for so long? Why should I approve of them being killed in cold blood when they pose no threat? They haven't even harmed a single person, yet Nada is killing them left, right, and centre, and then I'm supposed to feel sorry for the humans when the aliens fight back? Whaaaat??I also found the film rather slow moving. There were times when it felt like the film needed a push. Then there was the annoying fight scene between Nada and his friend (mind you!), Frank, that seemed to go on forever - and the only reason they nearly KILLED each other, is because Frank refused to put on the glasses. Seriously?!! Meg Foster's character, Holly, also doesn't really bring much to the table. All the characters were underdeveloped, in fact.The script also provides very little explanation of anything, really. Where does the glasses come from? Who made them? Why do they even exist? This is a weird - and ultimately boring - film.Would I watch it again? Uhm, no-o-o!",They Live
56,tomgillespie2002,Actually very clever beneath all the silliness,6,14 October 2012,"A nameless drifter know simply as 'Nada' (former WWF wrestler Roddy Piper) wanders into Los Angeles and finds construction work to get him by. He befriends Frank (Keith David), who takes him to a homeless community, where the impoverished do what they can to help themselves and each other. Nada notices that at a nearby church, a group of freedom fighters, including a man who hacks into TV stations to deliver a message about society being enslaved, are stocking something in massive quantities. When the police destroy the community, Nada escapes after stealing one of the boxes, only to discover they are stacked with sunglasses which, when worn, allows Nada to see the truth - the planet has been overthrown by an elite alien race that are using advertising and mass media to deliver subliminal messages to the consumerist public.Using numerous sources, including the work of H.P. Lovecraft and the short story 'Eight O'Clock in the Morning' by Ray Nelson, as his inspiration, director John Carpenter coined the idea for They Live after becoming sickened by the media's aim to simply take your money. It's a quite fascinating concept, as Nada wanders the streets littered with signs dictating messages such as 'Obey', 'Marry and Reproduce' and 'Keep Sleeping', to keep the human race zombified and hooked on consuming. Admittedly, it's a rather graceless and unsubtle execution, but They Live has its tongue so far in its cheek that its popping out the other side, and its mise-en-scene rooted in comic book aesthetic. When Nada wanders into a bank rocking a shotgun, spying the numerous alien suits, and proclaims ""I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubble gum!"", you'll know it's not exactly a film to take too seriously.The film is littered with memorable scenes and moments that have cemented its status amongst the cult favourites of its era, and most memorable is the five minute fight between Nada and Frank, as the former tries to get the latter to try the sunglasses, with Frank refusing given Nada's previous killing spree. It's a ridiculous episode, re-starting numerous times when you think its all over, but it's very funny, and actually impressively choreographed. The casting of 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper as the lead only increases the curiosity I had with this film, and although he's never going to win any Oscars, his lethargic and stoic approach suits his character, and makes himself a memorable hero (even with his sociopathic yet casual approach to mass murder). But beneath all the silliness, there is something very clever here, and has a relevant message that is even more powerful today. The coming together of various mediums into something we carry in our pocket, means the advertising elite are now always on our person - our phones seem to run our lives, with millions noting down their every move on social networking sites. Anyway, I digress, but it's these intriguing themes that make it such a shame that the film is so eager not to take itself too seriously, it resorts to ham-fisted (yet very funny) action scenes and cheesy one-liners every time it's in danger of becoming satirical. Yet, I suppose, it's the ridiculousness of the film that makes it so memorable, and it is undoubtedly a fun and colourful comic-book sci- fi/horror.",They Live

58,poe426,Down and out...,10,13 July 2010,"Remarkable when it was first released, John Carpenter's THEY LIVE still holds up- and is still (unfortunately) relevant. The damage done by the Republican Reich in this country will take a lot of undoing (the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, is a direct result of a lack of government regulation and its long-term effects are still unknown); nor are Reaganvilles like the one Roddy Piper lives in in the movie a thing of the past (the homeless abound here where I live, though city ordinances have been enacted in an attempt to at least keep them out of sight/out of mind). THEY LIVE moves along at a pretty rapid clip, and Piper is much better here than he was in HELL HAS COME TO FROGTOWN (which isn't a bad little movie in its own right). The makeups remind me more than a little of the creatures in I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE (THEY LIVE feels overall like a 50s sci-fi shocker) and the space-traveling ""jaunts"" from planet to planet seem to have been inspired by Alfred Bester's THE STARS MY DESTINATION.

59,eddie_baggins,"An important part of film history, plus one amazing fight",7,10 February 2014,"Hopefully any film fan will agree that there is a true unbridled joy found in the watching of a John Carpenter film from his 1980's heydays. With The Thing, The Fog, Starman, Escape From New York and Big Trouble in Little China the decade was a productive, unique and enjoyable time for the master of schlock and all his fans. Ending off the decade of greatness was 1988's They Live and while not in the same league as the previously mentioned films is still a thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi yarn that had a lot to say then and even more to say in today's climate.Carpenters yarn is a film that operates on many a level whether it be as a comedy, a political/social commentary, a Sci-Fi or merely a low budget action flick and is a tale that has more ideas than a dozen modern day movies. The centralised tale of drifter Nada played by the muscle clad Wrestlemania star Roddy Piper is an excuse for Carpenter to critique the ever growing marketing of the modern world where everything exists to sell or promote to the people. It's a startling idea realised in a still grand fashion of magic glasses that allow the wearer to see things for what they are – come to the Caribbean is replaced with ""Marry and reproduce"" marketing signs replaced by the lone and now famous ""Obey"". With a low budget Carpenter realised many a great idea even if he made no secret of production hearkening to 50's Sci-Fi production design.When praising many elements of They Live it must also be stated that when compared to other works of Carpenters career peaks it pales in comparison, not fit to wear Snake's eye patch or hold MacReady's flamethrower, it's a film that jumps a little too much in tone and the finale is somewhat too haphazard to end the film off on a high. Piper to is too cold in the main role, the wrong side of being too cool for school and the musical score by Carpenter and musical partner Alan Howarth is also a little too frequent and repetitive to not grate by the hour mark. Small criticisms of an enjoyable film yet enough to tarnish it from true classic territory.They Live is a lively, energetic and unique film that is deserving of a watch by any Carpenter or Sci-Fi fan. Featuring unquestionably one of cinemas greatest fight scenes and ideas/concepts that have now seeped into everyday culture They Live stands as a historic and important part of movies as we know them today.3 and a half unnaturally long ally fights out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",They Live
60,kapelusznik18,The world needs a wake up call and were gonna phone it in,6,1 February 2016,"***SPOILERS***Based on Ray Nelson's 1963 short story ""Eight O'clock in the Morning"" the movie ""They Live"" has to do with a secret invasion of Earth by alien forces who integrate themselves with the human race as they slowly take it over. It's out of town drifter turned construction worker John Nada, Roddy Piper, who soon gets the drop on who these aliens are by coming across a box of discarded sun glasses after the church were they where hidden in was ransacked by the gestapo-like local police who bulldozed it to the ground.Putting the glasses on John sees the world in the a stark black & white aliens prospective in them controlling everyone on earth with subliminal messages telling the humans to blindly obey them and desist from preventing their control of the human race. Even worse John sees that a good number of human beings are traitors to their own race by joining the aliens in enslaving the human race so that they can be on the ""Winning Team"" when they finally take over. John in trying to sound an alert after slugging it out with his non believing fellow construction worker Frank Armitage, Keith David,finally get him to see, with a new pair of sun glasses, the light and thus join him in his fight to both inform and save the human race from what's planned for them by the alien invaders.****SPOILERS**** John in his attempt to knock out the TV dish that keeps the human population from finding out what the aliens are doing to them is betrayed by Holly Thompson played by a zombie-looking Meg Ryan who already betrayed him once- The guy just never learned- before by blowing away his fellow human freedom fighter Frank and turning him over to her alien masters. This all backfires on her and the aliens that she's working for by John blasting her, with a hidden firearm, as well as blasting the TV dish and thus having the entire human race able, without the uses of the mysterious sun glasses, to see the aliens for what and who they really are and most of all, by joining together, by being able to finally stop them.",They Live

You know these new stealth copters....but seriously, there should be more movies like this.  It updates 50s paranoia into the late 80s early 90s fear of economic collapse, xenophobia.... but this is only a surface interpretation.  In truth, it's a clever satire that only a few will appreciate; it plays on our notion of who we are, whether the human race can have enemies or would always be its own enemy.  It also parodies our selfishness and stupidity and blindness to the situations that are really around us, our ability to go on with a situation we know is intolerable, and it's about how one man (two men) could reach the breaking point.  Homoerotic undertones?  I think so.  Isn't the black guy jealous at one point in the movie?  Anyway, great film, love it",They Live
66,Anonymous_Maxine,Quite possibly the scariest funny movie ever made. Or the funniest scary movie ever made.,8,9 February 2004,"They Live is one of those horror movies that is so scary and so good that it has become a comedy classic. Yes, comedy. There are maybe a total of five horror films that were made in the 80s that are or ever were even slightly frightening, the majority of them, particularly those which remain popular today, are popular because of their comedic value much more than their scariness. Now, I don't mean to badmouth 80s horror or to suggest that these movies are a sustained string of cinematic failures, but you really can't watch something like one of the Nightmares on Elm Street or a Friday the 13th film and afterwards say that you laughed less than you were scared. Okay, so maybe this is just me, but I really think that it can hardly be denied that the comedic content of horror films provide a large part of their overall appeal. And whether you personally agree with me or not, it's not hard to see that John Carpenter agrees.My favorite example of this in They Live is the way Nada (the basically nameless main character) reacts when he first begins to see what the alien beings really look like when he finds those glasses. Personally, I would have kept my visions a little more to myself until I figured out what was going on, but this guy hilariously tells an elderly woman exactly what he thinks of her appearance in the middle of a crowded convenience store. Now, I should probably point out that this is not really something that translates very well into film-review form, you just have to see it for yourself. By explaining it in writing here I feel like Mr. Burns trying to be funny (`We'll have some excellent practically-based jokes!').
And then, of course, there is the violence, which is so overdone that it's subsequent humor is nearly unrivaled until Quentin Tarantino came along and made Kill Bill. Nada is a construction worker who is struggling to maintain a job (as are many of the other workers), but desperately needs to show his visions to someone else just to make sure he's not insane. He finds himself wanted by the police (for reasons that I won't explain), and shows up at the construction site where he works to try to get one of his coworkers (also struggling to maintain this job to make ends meet) to try on the glasses. Personally, if I was in that guy's situation I wouldn't want to be getting involved with this apparent nutcase either, especially if I needed that job as badly as he obviously did. Nada is not about to let the guy go until he sees, though, and thus follows The Fight Scene, capitalized for obvious reasons. And by the way, if the guy didn't want to get involved with Nada, it seems like it would have been slightly less troublesome to just look through the glasses and walk away than to get into a full-on kickboxing match with him in broad daylight for half and hour or so.I watched the DVD version of They Live, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed that there was nothing on the DVD about how they did the makeup of the aliens, because I always thought that that was the most interesting part of the movie (besides the fact that the whole control issue so closely resembled the operation of mass media and commercialism in real life). So what you have in They Live is a very interesting premise with a pretty simple delivery, but it works because it's cleverly done and believable, despite the fact that the whole magical sunglasses thing is more something that you might expect to see in a fiction story written by a kid in fourth grade. When I was in fourth grade I wrote a story about a hat that I could put on to make myself invisible, and the conceptual difference is really not that much.They Live is one of those 80s horror/comedy gems that is widely overlooked, especially today, when massive video chains like Blockbuster have reduced their horror sections to contain little more than the ridiculous crap that Hollywood cranks out and foolishly labels horror films, like Jeepers Creepers (one of the dumbest horror films to come along since I Know What You Did Last Summer) and other such nonsense. Granted, they still carry a few of the good ones - my local Blockbuster still has the original Nosferatu in its horror section, as well as some of the excellent recent horror films like The Ring and Ringu, upon which The Ring was based. And I DID rent They Live from my local Blockbuster, but it was in the DRAMA section. WOW. This is an example of the way that the horror genre has evolved and the way that older horror films have been affected. You would think that if they were going to completely redefine a genre, they would at least have put a movie like They Live in the COMEDY section.",They Live

70,hellraiser7,Hidden Inflitrators,10,11 November 2018,"This is another one of my favorite films of all time and my sixth favorite film by one of my favorite film directors John Carpenter. It's also my favorite alien invasion film of all time, I like the fact that this is once again another one of those covert alien invasion stories which I always found the most interesting kinds of stories because it shows the aliens using clever tactics for takeover as opposed to the clichéd direct approach. This film is sort of like ""V the miniseries"" only that series took the allegorical approach, this film takes the satirical one and it's unrelenting at that.I really like the story and premise which I think is very clever and plausible when you think about it. Aliens using Capitalism to prey on our own weaknesses for control, it's literally takeover without firing a single shot because we've allowed ourselves to be enslaved by our own greed and vanity.The film has a bit of a sense of humor in places which makes the film not all so serious. One bit that makes me snicker a little is seeing some of the They aliens in commando/army uniforms at the TV station using what looks like a PKE meter from ""Ghostbusters"". Yeah, if I ever saw guys like that running in my place of work using things like that, I'd believe their aliens. And of course, what Roddy Piper says in that bank with that bubblegum quote that has been referenced from the ""Duke Nukem 3D"" game.The two main protagonists are solid and sympathetic, Keith David on of my favorite actors is good as usual as Frank he's rough, tough, and cool all at once.
But of course, Roddy Piper really drives this film, I remember seeing him in this film thinking how cool it was seeing him in a movie for the first time since Rowdy Roddy Piper is one of my favorite WWE wrestlers. This film was his film debut and he doesn't disappoint as he is a surprisingly capable actor, it sucks that he didn't get to become an action star the fact that didn't happen I thought was a lost opportunity. But anyway, he really plays it straight as John Nada as opposed to his usual rowdy cheery over the top persona from WWE, this is a guy the feels like any other guy that is down on his luck.I kind of like how he has a sort of passive aggressive persona throughout the whole film which is interesting because though most of the film he really doesn't say much, but he doesn't really need to as his facial expressions really say it all for us, but also he's a doer. Those things I can emphasize with as I'm not much of a talker and more of a doer myself. Though he's not all quiet as he has some of the best and memorable lines in any movie. Really like the back and forth both Frank and he have making this film a bit of a buddy cop movie, whenever they talk with each other it feels like both are friends whom have their agreements and disagreements.But we really feel for both characters as both are literally down on their luck which makes us all the more want them to win. Both aren't losers their underdogs smart people that have been crap canned by society which is unfortunately true with most smart guys and girls. They both want to have the good life and make something out of themselves they just need the chance; you can say fighting evil aliens is one hell of a chance.I really love the shades sequences, when we see everything in black and white which is interesting. Supposedly this is a way of seeing everything as it really is which is cool, strange and eerie. Just like Roddy we are slowly but surely discovering what is what; when we see in the shade's viewpoint the world in black and white, sort of like in the film ""Pleasantville"". It's really gives you a feeling that you've just entered a whole different world where it may look the same but isn't.We are seeing reading material and things that all have subluminal messages like ""Obey"", ""No Imagination"" and other stuff. And of course, when he sees one of the aliens for the first time, just like that reaction on his face I was thinking ""ok this is starting to get a little scary."" These sequences also induce the sense of isolation as he, a sum of people and us are the only ones that really know and see the truth.The They aliens are good villains, they sort of could be ""Doctor Who"" villains, ironic I say that since the show did a two parter with the 12th Doctor where aliens utilizing the same deception tactics to take over earth. I really like the make up design of them as the aliens are these creepy walking skeletal faced beings with strange sparkling eyes. It's a scary thought the possibility that the next person you talk to or see could be one of them in disguise. But what make them a true threating is their deceptive nature, not just from hiding their looks but true intentions, they can talk to you like your best friend but really aren't.In one scene, one human male is talking to one of the aliens sad that he didn't get the promotion, and the alien is giving him encouragement but it's false sincerity, we know why the human didn't get the promotion and probably never will. The They aliens just go to show how capitalism, greed and vanity can make inhuman monsters of us all.The action is solid, from of course this film has one of my favorite fights of all time which is the infamous fist fight scene between both Nada and Frank yeah, no surprise, which has been parodied in ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons"". It was just really fun but also kind of funny as both we're just going at it for a long time all because he just won't put on the damn glasses, seriously it wouldn't of killed you, let alone avoided all of the pain received. Though this is kind of funny because it's true as most fights are started because of the stupidest reasons.But also the shootouts from the bank shootout and the one I like best the final battle at the TV station, really love it when the go down that long white hallway which I though was a pretty tense part of the shootout almost similar to the sequence in ""Hard Boiled"" as it plays out almost like a live action first person shooter game. We see both character as they slowly approach forward, just ready to take out any aliens that pop out every corner and avoid hitting innocent people coming their path. I also like the cinematography on the gun discharges as we get a slight close on the M-16 muzzle discharging.However the film is not all fun and games as the main thing that drives is as I said it's unflinching satire on the issue of our capitalistic counterculture which was heavily prevalent in the 80's but this film has became eerily and even a little scarily prolific on what's happening now as this problem now became much worse with our growing epidemic of homelessness, authority abuse, media manipulation, corruption within the upper class system and politics that is literally choking every class in their eyes beneath them.One of the residing themes in the film is on what America is and should be. We see a couple of scenes where a television is showing a flag and an eagle, but also, we then see the encampment site which has all different races from all walks of life. The people in the encampment site along with John Nada and Frank are all the true America because they all follow the true golden rule which is do unto others as they would do unto you, as some are helping to get though the day to have what they essentially need in life and a little hope for the future. In John and Frank's case it's fighting and defending freedom itself, which is the American way.What disturbing about the They aliens just like the aliens in ""V the Miniseries"" they're also a fascistic force as their doing exactly what the Nazis have done, from their deceptive tactics pretending to be friends and helping. But also, in one scene they are destroying and driving out the encampment community from their homes, which is the same thing the Nazis did with the Jewish communities, only here it's happening on America soil. Seeing that scene alone shows how far society has sunk, betraying American values to make a quick buck.The only bad things about the film are Meg Foster's character is useless (except for part of the end), she just seems like a filler character much like Bidwell in a season of ""Doctor Who"" just wasn't needed. But also, most of what happens at the end, it felt like a rush job as there was a twist from out of the blue that doesn't work, let alone what happens with both leads I thought was a bit of an insult. It's almost as if the writer didn't know the proper way to end the film but was under pressure and just came up with a half baked solution. This doesn't hurt the film too much, because the ending isn't bad per say but all the same it's not great it could have been handled better. Overall this is a great film I highly recommend if you a John Carpenter fan as well as a fan of the alien invasion genre.Don't look up at the skies for the aliens, they could be right under your nose.Rating: 4 stars",They Live
71,Captain_Couth,The Cinema of John Carpenter: They Live.,9,20 August 2005,"They Live (1988) was another classic science fiction-action film from John Carpenter. The eighties were a great time for this legendary film maker. Some of his best work was made during this era. Professional Wrestler Roddy Piper stars as Nada, a homeless day laborer who becomes a hero by accident. Keith David co-stars as his running buddy. Earth has been slowly invaded by aliens under the guise of conservative Reganites. They have repressed the have nots and corrupted those who are willing to sell out their friends and neighbors. The aliens use a form of mind control to not only brain wash the masses but it's also used to cloak the aliens true identity. They pollute the environment to make the air more breathable. Nada stumbles across a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses (During a routine police raid on homeless camps) that allows it's wearer to go beyond the sophisticated alien cloaking device. Shocked by what the world has become, he tries to get his friend to wear them. After a lengthy fist fight, his buddy is convinced and joins him to find those who made the glasses.The two hide out in a flophouse until things cool down. It's there that they met the few remaining members of the human underground. They're planing a raid on the local television station (that's where they think that the satellite feed from the aliens is coming from). But before they can execute the plan, a informant has ratted them out from their hide-out. Only a handful of fighters escape the raid. Nada and his buddy head for the Television Station. Nada fights his way to the top of the building only to be betrayed yet again. Before he's gunned down by a police helicopter, he fires his pistol into the transmitter. Dying, Nada sees it blow up right before his eyes. Now everyone wakes out of their alien induced slumber and sees the aliens for what they're truly are.Awesome film.

When he finds a job a fellow worker, Frank (the always awesome Keith David) takes Nada to a shantytown to stay where Nada notices odds things going on at the church opposite, leading him to discover a pair of sunglasses which lets him see the aliens that are really in control of the world.They Live is basically a Marxist thesis being made into turned into a film. Nada is able to see the evil network of the upper ends of Capitalism are secretly controlling the world, using mass market and hegemony to enact their plans, keep the masses down and make humans no more then unquestioning puppets. There is a criticism of mass media in the 80s at it constantly bombard the masses with adverts and poor programmes: it can be easy to make the case that it is even worst now with the rise of celebrity culture and reality TV. There are even modern parallel as well about the divide between the wealthy and the poorest in America and a little nugget where it was mentioned the government bailed out the steel industry show no gratitude and the bosses give themselves massive bonuses.The acting is mostly weak to put it nicely. Piper was a WWF wrestler so it was clear he was not a trained actor, but he does have the action chops and has charisma. Piper also has an excellent ad-lipped one liner that was fitting for Carpenter's style. David is always a welcome presence in film and he was the best actor in the film.Carpenter supplies plenty of B-Movie violence and action which will please fans. Two of the best moments are when Nada's makes his discovery he goes on a killing spree and a five minute long fight scene between two bulky men simply trying to beat the hell out of each other. It's the kind of thing you want in a film like this.They Live is a tout film, having a running time of 90 minutes. This is a film that buys into conspiracy theories that the world is secretly run by people who for the own interests, grind down any dissent and no chance of advancement. I personally do not subscript this world view but people who enjoy Carpenter's work will get pleasure from They Live.",They Live
73,strong-122-478885,"WTF!?... Is This Really Our ""God""!? => $$$$$$$$",4,23 April 2012,"Fave Movie quote - ""The ""Golden Rule"" - He who has the gold, makes the rules."" Director John Carpenter once claimed that initially ""They Live"" wasn't a success because a vast number of people just didn't want to be ""enlightened"".(Oh! Really!??) Like - If enlightening us poor, pathetic ignoramuses was really Carpenter's mission in life (and not to make piles of money) - And if this film's message failed to accomplish said goal - Then why the hell didn't Carpenter (feeling so strongly as he did) go for a second attempt at illuminating the ignorant masses? Eh? Why? (He certainly had the resources to do so) And, besides that - What's it to Carpenter whether a vast number of people chose not to be enlightened, anyways? Eh? What's it to him? I mean - If Carpenter had actually went ahead and spent a few extra bucks on some decent looking make-up effects (instead of having his aliens look like a bunch of frickin' Kermit the Frogs on speed), then maybe, just maybe, a vast number of people might have paid attention to this film's message and actually been enlightened.... No? Released in 1988, ""They Live's"" story was basically already 25 years old before Carpenter got his grubby hands on it and adapted for the screen in the most cheesy fashion imaginable. Its ideas essentially came from Ray Nelson's 1963 novella called ""Eight O'Clock In The Morning"".Personally, I don't know why people view ""They Live's"" story as all that intelligent, anyhow. If intelligent aliens really wanted to wipe us out (non-violently), then what could be a more simple (and intelligent) course of action than to put us all to sleep - And once asleep - Presto! - We die - And just dispense with all of this subliminal brain-washing rigmarole. (Like - Spare me!) As I see it - ""They Live"" was pretty much a poor-man's Sci-Fi/Comedy, where guns never empty, fights are poorly choreographed, production values are at an all-time low, and our tough, pretty-boy hero (whose name literally meant ""nothing"") only understands the state of the world through chewing bubble gum and kicking ass.Don't get me wrong. I didn't hate ""They Live"". As far as its entertainment value went, I found it to be about on par with the likes of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Yep. It was no better, or worse, than that.",They Live

In fact, I don't think there's a single conspiracy theory to which he doesn't subscribe. It's no surprise that he recommended 'They Live (1988)' as one of his favourites, and, I must admit, it is a rip-roaring film with an intriguing premise. Robust drifter George Nada (pro-wrestler Roddy Piper) discovers a pair of sunglasses that reveals the world for how it actually is: billboards and magazines sparkle with Orwellian phrases, and many ""people"" are actually grotesque extraterrestrial beings bent on enslaving humanity. Nada begins to resist the status quo, recruiting a reluctant co-worker (Keith David) into the true nature of reality, but only after a gratuitous but hilariously intense fist-fight that lasts a good five minutes.'They Live' was apparently a response to the Yuppie subculture that was prevalent throughout the 1980s; that is, young middle-class businessmen obsessed with wealth, status, and materialism. The Yuppies have gotten a raw deal in popular culture: The Narrator in 'Fight Club (1999)' was a disenchanted consumerist seeking to feel human again, and Bret Easton Ellis' novel ""American Psycho"" (certainly one of the more disturbing books I've ever read) was an altogether unflattering depiction of ""stereotypical"" yuppie Patrick Bateman (superbly played by Christian Bale in the tamer 2000 film adaptation). 'They Live' subscribes to a working-class fantasy in which all wealthy people are either aliens – here, Carpenter takes an uproarious dig at Siskel and Ebert – or humans who have betrayed their species for the good life.",They Live
75,kevin_robbins,This is a must have for your DVD collection and a must see for horror fans,9,26 April 2021,"They Live (1988) is an all time classic I recently watched for free on Vimeo. The storyline focuses on a couple construction workers who discover some sun glasses that show hidden agendas in our commercials, magazines and society in general as well as aliens disguised as humans among us. Can two construction workers save the world? This movie is directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, The Fog and The Thing) and stars Roddy Piper (Hell comes to Frog Town), Keith David (The Thing), Meg Foster (The Lords of Salem), Peter Jason (48 Hrs.) and Susan Blanchard (Prince of Darkness). The story for this was created by John Carpenters perception of the Republicans, Reagan-nomics and the impact on society during the Reagan administration. There are so many political undertones in this, ""worship greed,"" is a reference to his perception of Republicans, and how money and false narratives in commercials, magazine and the news sways public opinion. It was a very smart storyline. He changed Republicans into aliens for the sake of a horror storyline. The makeup on the aliens faces is so well done. Roddy Piper and his one liners were awesome, especially the ""kick-ass and chew bubble gum"" and ""Formaldehyde-face"" lines. Also loved the homeless man in this. Overall this is an epic masterpiece in terms of entertainment value. It isn't a ""perfect"" film but you find it so entertaining you overlook a few warts. This is a movie that felt like it could have been 45 minutes longer and still been just as fun. Overall this is a must have for your DVD collection and a must see for horror fans. I'd score this a 9/10.",They Live

77,dwpollar,Different aliens among us movie...,6,7 November 2009,"1st watched 10/6/2009, 6 out of 10 (Dir- John Carpenter): Different aliens among us movie presents the idea that all those doing well are aliens and the low life's are human. The film starts out as a homeless man just trying to get a job -- becomes curious and runs into a group that is blocking TV transmissions. He finds a box of glasses that reveals the alien presence in subliminal messages on billboards and, of course, who are aliens and who are not. The intriguing part of the movie is that some humans decide to work with the aliens to get ahead and some don't. This is obviously an allegory about our current world as well and it's nicely done by John Carpenter. Instead of a typical gross-out alien movie -- we get a thought provoking story with some action but made very plainly just to get his point across, I guess. In my opinion, this is one of his overlooked gems that should be viewed by more and given it's place as an alternative alien movie. It's not spectacular-- but has a nice slow paced story that brings you along with some tongue-in-cheek humor and an interesting message made with an obvious low budget -- but done well.",They Live
78,lukem-52760,Another Masterpiece from the legendary Carpenter,10,26 November 2018,"John Carpenter is my favourite director,he's just excellent & a Genius.THEY LIVE is the most important work of Carpenter's career, it's a film that is so relevant & speaks alot of truth. Amongst the action & thrills there's alot being said & lots that has happened & is happening now!!! A wake up movie, a sci-fi Thriller full of depth & scary realism.Carpenter is also easily the most influential director of all time!!! Almost every new director is trying to channell that creepy isolated atmosphere that oozes out of his excellent & classic movies.THEY LIVE is another BRILLIANT Thriller in Carpenters BRILLIANT 80's era filmography & this film is truly OUTSTANDING & way ahead of it's time!!!I won't go into all the political bits about government corruption & all that's sprinkled all over this exciting sci-fi action Thriller as many have in great detail by many carpenter fanatics so this is about how much i love this true cult classic.Roddy Piper was perfectly cast instead of Carpenter regular Kurt Russell who is also EXCELLENT but Piper feels new & fresh faced,some new rugged action hero drifter & he's excellent!!!Roddy looks AWESOME & acts Awesome & really does make a cool down to earth-low on luck Hero who wanders into a huge conspiracy involving Alien beings.The music again is excellent as always by the legendary Carpenter & also his look & shots of Los Angeles are BEAUTIFUL & creepy at the same time!!! You feel the loneliness of his characters & hopelessness of their situation as the streets look eerily deserted most of the time with a sense of dread in the air like something big is about to happen!!!Carpenter is the master of moody atmospheric landscapes & here in the city of Angeles matches any of his other classic's & similar in tone & style to his 70's masterpiece Assault on precinct 13!!!The Great Keith David (who was in Carpenters The Thing) is the best he's ever been in here in his role as Frank, another unlikely down on his luck hero who eventually teams up after a huge CLASSIC fight with Nada (piper) & these two are hilarious together & make one of the best teams in cinema history.I connected more with Keith's Frank in the movie because Frank is father & family man who has had to move on his own to sweaty, smoggy & busy L. A to find work as back home in Detroit he lost his job & was left stuck with nothing. Frank hasn't seen his wife & kids for months & is angry at the system & government that only takes care of the one's with money & power. I totally understand Frank's attitude to everything & i think he's the real hero of the movie & the most relatable & one of Carpenter's best written characters. Keith David is better here than he was in The Thing.Nada is such an interesting character too, he's a loner & drifter who is a decent guy but seems lost & doesn't know his place in the world & he tells a little about his tough childhood with his violent father & it's all those little bits that also make Nada one of Carpenter's best written characters too!!! Roddy seriously gives an excellent & thoughtful performance as Nada & is pretty much mesmerising in the role, piper was truly a gifted actor if given a good role. The buddy aspect of ""They Live"" is also one of it's greatest strengths as Nada & Frank make such a good duo & you just love these guys. Two ordinary, down-on-their-luck guys trying to survive in the gritty & dirty streets of Los Angeles & end up becoming heroes of the world.Yes this late 80's time for John Carpenter was actually as good as his earlier years when he made Halloween & The Fog as here he made a Trilogy of movies one after the other that are all absolute BRILLIANT!!! We first had the fun fantasy Cult CLASSIC Big Trouble In Little China (1986) that i grew up loving & then it was the BRILLIANT Horror Thriller Prince Of Darkness (1987) & then finally the Excellent SCI-FI Action Thriller They Live (1988),all 3 are fantastic movies.They Live is still relevant today actually even more so!!! & John Carpenter created 2 of his best characters in this film with the rugged tough drifter hero Nada (piper) & the equally tough Frank (David) & that makes this movie easily one of Carpenters best,definitely in the top 5 of Carpenters movies.So yes They Live is a truly exciting action packed sci-fi Cult classic with career best performances from the 2 leads Roddy Piper & Keith David so this movie deserves the huge cult following it's gained & makes for perfect late night entertainment.",They Live
79,hu675,One of the Coolest and Underrated Films of the Late 1980's.,8,2 September 2005,"John Nada (Roddy Piper) comes to L.A. to search for a Job. On the same working place, when he finds a job. John meets Frank (Keith David), Frank asks John to come along. Where Frank stays with poor people and a place to rest. Once he gets there, John watches television and sees some subliminal reporting by a scientist. The scientist is trying to get an important message on television by using frequency. John knows, there is something unusual going on at a house nearby. After a small band of cops are beating these poor people trying to find, where does that frequency is coming from. The next day, John goes to the house nearby and he finds one thing an open box. That box was hidden in the wall and when John open that box. He finds nothing but sunglasses. When he takes one of them, John sees a whole different world. A Bizarre look of L.A. in black & white with images full of subliminal advertising messages are visible though special glasses. Then he notice the only purpose of these glasses are the civilians are mixed with aliens population amongst them! Directed by John Carpenter (Assault on Precient 13, Ghosts of Mars, The Thing-1982) made a extremely well made film mixed with action/sci-fi elements and a refreshing scene of humor. Piper is good here, he has some memorable scenes with some funny dialogue. The film's best line from Piper is ""I come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass but i'm all out of bubble gum"". There is also an unforgettable scene with Piper and David, when Piper asks David to put the glasses on. When David refuses to put them on. Piper and David get into a very funny fistfight scene that turned into a classic scene. The film might have a few flaws, only depending a matter of personal taste. The Alien Make-Up effects are extremely awful but intentionally funny. The film ends with a great pay-off. The film is hilarious at times and always fun to watch. Since this film like most Carpenter's works become a Cult Classic.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Surround 2.0 Sound. Too Bad, Universal didn't release a Special Edition of this landmark independent film. The DVD from Europe, Carpenter and Piper recorded an running commentary track for this film in a two disc special edition. When in the U.S. get out Special Edition ? DVD doesn't have no features. This is a amusing satiric sci-fi adventure. Underrated to be sure, the film ages well despite awful alien make-up. Based on a Short Story by Ray Faraday Nelson titled ""Three O'Clock in the Morning"". Screenwriter ""Frank Armitage"" is actually director Carpenter. Panavision. (****/*****).",They Live
80,jfgibson73,Cult Classic,5,26 May 2013,"I mostly saw this movie because of Roddy Piper. He can't act. At all. The story is run of the mill sci-fi, albeit one with a timeless message. Of course there are people in charge who are doing things most of us will never know about. The one interesting idea this movie had was the glasses that let the wearer see who the aliens are. It worked really well when we first get to see all the hidden messages in the magazine and billboards. The story was enough to keep me watching to see how it would end, but ended up reminding me of the old radio dramas from the 50's. In fact, I think I would rather listen to an episode of ""Lights Out"" than watch this again.",They Live
81,drystyx,Cult classic or just plain classic?,9,30 April 2007,"That is the question. Or is just both a cult classic and a classic? Whatever, this is a fun, thrilling, and yet remarkably intelligent film. And who can ever put on a pair of sunglasses again without expecting to see....? The characters hit the viewer hard, and none of them wimp out. All of them have a lot of integrity. Oh, yes, the plot? A drifter slowly ambles onto a plot of aliens who are here among us, and only by wearing special sunglasses can you not only see them, but you can see the propaganda they have been spreading. All this is done with a surreal attitude, but an all too realistic approach. You could swear it was really happening. Is it just a movie? The great fight scene between the two main male characters excels because it doesn't look choreographed. It begins as a real fight, with both parties not sure at first they want to fight, but then things get out of hand, and bam! Fight! They stumble, they miss, they fall, they get up. It is a real fight! Not some comical bit from action pictures that leave you shaking your head. But this is just one part of a great movie. There are so many parts you can pick, which is one sign of a cult classic, along with making characters out of what most movies would make stereotypes. The filming is not as surreal as a cult movie, so maybe it is just a classic. No matter what, there is gutsy action, and something for everyone. Pretty typical Carpenter work, but this is probably his best.",They Live
82,dworldeater,They Live. We Sleep.,10,27 February 2015,"John Carpenter's They Live is one of my all time favorite movies and in my opinion also one of his best. This action packed sci fi thriller is unique in many ways and delivers social messages without being preachy. This also is the best movie ever to star a pro wrestler and Roddy Piper is fantastic as the lead. The Rowdy One is John Nada. He is a loner and working class drifter looking for work and a better life. Nada soon discovers that skull faced aliens have infiltrated our society and are exploiting us for their own means of survival. One of my favorite actors, the criminally underrated Keith David is lead support actor and greatly helps carry the film. He worked with John Carpenter before on another classic and personal favorite, The Thing. He also is one of the few actors around that can nearly match Roddy Piper in toughness, but really act as well and deliver such a solid performance. The fight between Piper and Keith David is around 10 minutes long and one of the most memorable movie fights in film history. Also, setting the tone and pace to the film is John Carpenter's bluesy, rough and tumble working class score. While They Live is an entertaining, kick ass film with a ton of action and hilarious one liners, it also has a social message. The parallels between the aliens in control and The Reagan Administration are just as relevant in today's political landscape. In fact, the gaps between the have and have nots have widened. The homelessness problem is much worst and poverty and inflation continue to grow at a rapid rate. The wealthy elite are making more money than ever and at a great cost to our society as a whole. Meg Foster appears as well as John Carpenter regulars Peter Jason and George ""Buck"" Flower. I have fond memories of seeing this film in a packed theater when it was released in 1988 and I've been a huge fan ever since. I also remember purchasing one of my favorite albums on the same day. The album was the, at the time new release ""Leprosy"", by death metal legends Death on cassette. All and all, it was a great day in my youth.",They Live
83,ferbs54,Bubble Gum,7,26 April 2017,"Last night I had the pleasure of seeing a movie that I had wanted to see ever since its initial release in 1988, John Carpenter's satirical sci-fi horror outing ""They Live."" This is the film in which the late Roddy Piper stars as a drifter who comes into L.A. and gets a construction job. He befriends another worker, a black man (Keith David) who brings him to an outdoor soup kitchen. Nearby is a church that doubles as the HQ of a group of revolutionaries who are trying to spread the word that mankind is being manipulated and ruled by a group of outsiders, and, long story short, Piper later finds, in that church, a pair of sunglasses that, when put on, allows him to see all the subliminal advertising beneath the surface of our everyday reality. And even worse, he is now able to see that many of the folks walking the streets are, in reality, skull-faced aliens who are intent on conquering our fair planet! The first half of ""They Live"" is a very suspenseful 45 minutes indeed, while the second half turns much more action packed, as Piper and his buddy grab guns and proceed to blow things apart at the cable TV station where the aliens have set up a base. The film grows wackier and more outlandish as it proceeds, and contains one of the longest fight scenes in screen history; a completely over-the-top slugfest between Piper and David as Piper tries to get the other to try on those darn sunglasses. And ""They Live"" also contains one of the greatest lines in cinema history, as well. When Piper first gets wind of the alien presence, he grabs a shotgun, walks into a bank with his shades on, sees all the aliens about him and declares, ""I've come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubble gum!"" You've gotta love it! Actors Meg Foster and Raymond St. Jacques add their talents to the proceedings, and the film, which I recorded off of HBO, looks just great in high def. All in all, great fun. So glad that I was finally able to catch up with this one. And later this week, I hope to catch another Carpenter film that I have never seen before, ""Ghosts of Mars."" Stay tuned....",They Live

Keith David and Roddy Piper were great in this film, not matter the fact that neither had much acting ability (though David has improved over the years). I will state this, this film had one of the all-time funniest moments. The last scene, where the lover suddenly starts fornicating and says `Hey Baby, what's wrong.' A gas of a scene to see if you haven' watched this movie. Anyway, I'm a slut for bad movies which have no problem making fun of themselves.",They Live
85,aidanratesmovies,"""I came here to chew bubblegum and kick a**. And i'm all out of bubblegum...""",10,2 November 2020,"Although it isn't without its slower moments, They Live is a clever and unique little sci-fi gem that is not only peak Carpenter, but also flips modern themes on its head in more ways than one. What amazes me the most about They Live is not only that it remains a fun and well made film, but that it holds up still with its messages today. Its layered take on social issues, consumerism, and other glamorous lifestyles is told in a almost satirical but deeply repugnant manner that surprisingly still remains relevant. Besides the obvious social issues involved, They Live is also an excellent and campy little sci-fi gem full of some fun dialogue and excellent action scenes. The look of the film isn't anything special, and although the acting isn't in anyway perfect, it seems incredibly grounded, which fits a film of this nature. The script is complex, the dialogue witty, the world written well, and directed quite cleverly. There are some pacing issues towards the beginning of the film, nothing predictable necessarily, but you can feel like you are going through the motions. At times it can be a slow burn, but there is enough to keep you entertained and invested in these characters you come to view upon the screen. In the end, John Carpenter remains of the 20th centuries best directors by proving that he can not only make a great sci-fi flick, but a great social commentary, and a great B-movie too, all at once.
My Rating: 9.25/10",They Live
86,I_Ailurophile,"Classic, thoughtful sci-fi/action thriller",8,3 March 2021,"'They live' is another sorry instance where I can't believe it took me as long as it did to watch for the first time. This is a fantastically entertaining film, full of clever writing and sharp action, but which is also astoundingly relevant to our everyday lives.It's a little strange that one of the most well-known lines of bravado in pop culture comes from the film of a director whose works have often been spurned upon release, generally achieving cult status only much later. Although, that somehow tracks - speaking broadly, bits and pieces of Carpenter's remarkable filmography tend to get picked up by the wider culture, even if his films don't: Michael Myers is a horror icon, but the 'Halloween' franchise is known for generic slashers and not the sly thriller it spawned from. Snake Plissken's look and demeanor has inspired other characters, but not everyone who knows the likes of ""Metal Gear Solid"" recognizes the character or the movies he's from.It's almost like the all-consuming yet wasteful ethos of capitalism is so thoroughly ingrained in society that we'll hone in on and put on a pedestal those things that stand out to us the most about even a singular piece of media, and readily discard the rest no matter its value.That may seem like an abrupt tangent, but both one-liners and capitalism are essential to this movie: 'They live' is full of wit and action, but there's something much more substantial just below the surface.Rowdy Roddy Piper puts in a fine performance as our unnamed protagonist, often listed in credits simply as ""Nada."" A drifter looking for work, he stumbles into a camp for the homeless, where keen perception clues him in to strange goings-on centered on a neighboring church. And that's only the very beginning, as he comes to learn of an alien conspiracy controlling society from behind the scenes.Piper is joined by a great cast featuring Keith David, Meg Foster, and recurring Carpenter collaborators including the ever-lovable Peter Jason and the ubiquitous George Buck Flower. Everyone performs admirably as they bring this movie to life, from unprofessional subterfuge to shoot-outs, from a deliberately overlong and hilarious street fight to a climactic climb through an enemy stronghold. There aren't many quiet moments for our characters to get to know each other, and in one fashion or another most character interactions take place amidst more camera-ready activities, giving the feel of a brisk pace to the movie.The screenplay is full of smart dialogue to complement the action, and those two aspects together craft a film that should keep just about anyone happily engaged. But entertainment is only half of 'They live.'The feature, written during the height of the Reagan administration, is depressingly topical even today; the commentary on the structure of society is less than subtle. The aliens that our hero discovers are thinly-veiled stand-ins for the rich and powerful: An eye-opening scene late in the film shows the extraterrestrial overseers wine and dine with well-to-do human collaborators, their positions maintained or even granted by betraying the rest of the planet. Given the means to see reality for what it really is, Nada observes nearly every advertisement and product to be little more than a tool with which the governing entities manipulate ordinary people into mindlessly serving their needs. As if these peeks behind the curtain weren't enough, the police are also party to the conspiracy, noticeably protecting the interests of entrenched powers at the expense of the public at large that they have sworn oaths to serve. Stridently anti-capitalist themes are as plain, prominent, and paramount in 'They live' as Roddy Piper, and only with willful ignorance could they be disregarded or misinterpreted.While this is a movie that most sci-fi, action, and/or thriller fans could enjoy generally, the focus in the narrative on a message immediately relevant to daily life elevates it to a must-see for all but perhaps the youngest of viewers. On the one hand, 'They live' is fun and silly, but on the other, it has very important thoughts to convey.Putting aside the thrust of the narrative (as though one can, or would want to): 'They live' is well-written, with a strong cast, featuring compelling action and an engaging story. It fits snugly into the ouevre of a great filmmaker like John Carpenter, and it's well worth watching for just about anyone.",They Live
87,vertigo_14,"Simulacra forerunner to the ""Matrix"". (spoilers)",7,12 March 2006,"They Live is not especially great science fiction work from John Carpenter & Co. However, the themes presented here: that of a society blinded to the spectacle and ultimately, it's own doom--take over by an alien race--is a good fictional example of what French theorist Guy Dubord calls 'the Society of the Spectacle,' although the most amazing and thorough representation of it so far has been the first of the Matrix trilogy (although even these need not be science fiction films as seen in How to Get Ahead in Advertising and Fight Club, among others).This film, based on Ray Nelson's short story, ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning,"" may seem initially cheesy to begin with due to the starring role being held by former pro-wrestler Roddy Piper. Although, the supporting cast (especially Kieth David as his trusting ally and the seductive, but double-crossing Meg Foster) are solid enough to keep the movie in stride. The story involves a nomadic freelancer who comes to a rather rundown part of Los Angeles in search of work. Along with the temporary shelter he finds at a nearby communal area (where some fellow co-workers live), he also stumbles upon a crazy cult warning about the existence of dangerous aliens who have taken over the planet and blind the people as to their existence. The alien's credo: ""Obey"" and the people seem willingly in trance, able to be brainwashed through their consumerism of not only products, but slogans and rhetoric as well. The Americans (they don't focus on any other place) are conditioned to accept this and follow it easily. The aliens' plan for takeover through consumer habits seems so easy and, unfortunate for humanity, almost in completion.Sure it sounds like paranoid hooey, but not until the curious nomad stumbles upon sunglasses that expose the reality does he learn that the crazies at the church were right all along. The sun-glasses provide self-actualization and he tries to educate his friend (Kieth David) of the same, as he needs a fierce ally if they are to of course, try to stop their oppressors. It seems like a lot of work for two guys, but com'mon--this is an 80s action/sci-fi film and the numbers don't matter in the battle between good and evil.The political themes of this science fiction tale are of modern relevance and are more interesting than the actual execution of the film. Fans of decent b-grade science fiction should be impressed, although there are moments towards the end that seem to rile in somewhat mounting implausibility. It certainly is nonetheless entertaining in the cult classic sense and well worth trying.",They Live
88,a_chinn,"Corny, but engaging and still relevant minor sci-fi classic",8,24 March 2020,"This is another film I'm giving more stars to than it probably deserves because of a childhood fondness for it. For whatever reason, this film made an impression on me and always stuck in my memory. Despite the limited acting ability of professional wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper in the lead, the idea of aliens secretly taking over and subliminally lulling the populace into complacency (through TV, media, consumerism, and other distractions), the story remains interesting and relevant today (i.e. more screens, more apps, more distractions). A prescient film if there ever was one. Writer/director John Carpenter made this film in the 1980s Regan Era, but in the age of the 1%, the decline of the middle class, and police shootings, this film surprised me how relevant it is today and even more so than when it came out. Roddy Piper plays an out of work construction worker who discovers an alien race has secretly taken over the government, media, and the business world and have perpetrated a subliminal campaign to keep the masses asleep and in their place. When Piper discover specially designed sunglasses that allow him to see his world plastered with subliminal messages telling the masses to ""SLEEP"" ""OBEY"" ""CONSUME"" ""WATCH TV"" ""DO NOT QUESTION AUTHORITY"" ""MARRY AND REPRODUCE"" or ""THIS IS YOUR GOD"" printed on money. In this film, billboards and television are the main modes of conveying this message, but imagine how much easier it is to placate the masses in the internet age with smart phones, tables and laptops in the hands of most every citizen. Thematically, this film is Carpenter's most overtly political film. In terms of storytelling and tone, Carpenter has always had something of a throwback style and this film, although thematically serious and fairly grim at times, actually reminded me of the corny sci-fi films of the 50s and 60s. However, it works. One the spectrum of corny sci-fi, this is not goofy sci-fi for kids, like ""Invaders from Mars,"" but I would liken it to scrappy politically subversive science fiction films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" That film took on McCarthyism and Carptener's film is taking on the 1%. There are a number of Carpenter regulars in the film including Keith David, George ""Buck"" Flower, Peter Jason, and Al Leogn in an uncredited bit part. You also get Meg Foster and Sy Richardson so it's a solid cast. Overall, ""They Live"" is smart social commentary, even if it's told with a lot of hokum (and I'm not even going to get into epic fist fight between Piper and Keith David, which alone make the film worth watching).",They Live
89,davidmvining,"Great Ideas, but Broken Storytelling",5,14 September 2021,"My tastes in movies are pretty mundane, I think. Almost everything a movie fan is ""expected"" to like, I like, and most things I'm not ""supposed"" to like I don't. It's definitely not some effort to fit in with a particular set of movie fans (most of my movie conversations cheerfully take place with people who have vastly different tastes than I do), it's just how my tastes align. That being said, I've never been able to see the real appeal of They Live. I've seen this twice now, and I surprisingly had pretty much the exact same reaction now as I had the first time I saw it about fifteen years ago. I was kind of indifferent to it. There's entertaining stuff, but what this movie is really remembered for is about a twenty-minute section in the middle of the film, and I think that's because the movie outside of those twenty minutes doesn't make a whole lot of sense.There are interesting parallels between Carpenter's 1988 film and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver. In both, a man, detached from anything permanent, arrives in a new city to take a job. Both end up finding their cities overrun with people that disgust them, and both end with the central characters taking loaded guns to exact justice. In Scorsese's tale, it's told from a place of depression. In Carpenter's it's told from a place of pure rage. Emotions are strong places to tell stories from, but they also have this tendency to driving the writers away from the less interesting parts of building a narrative like structure. It's all about the core emotion, and anything else tends to get pushed aside. Come and See is an example of a great film born from pure rage, put together with care at creating a very specific emotional reaction that the film is asking the audience to share. They Live seems to operate under the assumption that everyone who watches it will share Carpenter's emotion and objects of hatred from the get go.It's hard not to see this as part of Carpenter's frustrating career, working hard within the system to deliver what people want and getting rejected when he puts himself out there (The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China), and I do think that's part of the anger here (the talk of ""selling out"" feels key to that). However, Carpenter has said on more than one occasion that this film is about one thing, and one thing only: Reaganism, and boy did he hate Ronald Reagan. Can he make a great movie where the central point was hating Ronald Reagan and his economic policy? Yes, he very much could have. Did he? I don't really think so.The problem, I think, is that the bad guys are never really defined clearly. Nada (Roddy Piper), shows up in Los Angeles and finds a job at a construction site. He stays the night in a small homeless encampment across the street from a church where a pirate signal is going out trying to cut into the signal from a cable channel with a satellite dish (sure, okay). Very soon thereafter, the police show up and clear out the camp. Now, this is one of the keys to hating the antagonists of the film, and I'm going to be honest, it falls short. Going after a pirate signal isn't the action that takes me immediately away from them. Clearing out a homeless encampment isn't either. I think the level of violence is supposed to be a trigger, but, surprisingly, the violence is rather tame.Separated from his nascent bit of civilization, Nada finds himself with a single pair of sunglasses that show him a hidden world just under the surface. Every ad, magazine, and sign is telling him to buy, consume, and obey. This is the stuff that the movie is known for, and it's a great image. However, it's also surprisingly pedestrian. Ads want you to consume? Yes, they do. It's not exactly a secret. The more insidious part is that there are creatures among us, disguised as humans, and the sunglasses show Nada who they are. They're ugly, looking more like decaying corpses (by design) than living creatures, and they control everything. After Nada takes out a few in a bank with a shotgun, he runs back to the one man who was nicest to him, Keith David's Frank. News of Nada's rampage have reached Frank, and he's unwilling to meet with a murderer. Nada needs someone to confide in, and the two end up in the famous five-minute alleyway fight. The fight itself is brutal and realistic in ways that most fights aren't with the two landing punches and needing time to recover from their injuries, but I find a hard time really getting into it because the ask from Nada is so small: to put on the glasses. I get the masculine urge to not bow to pressure on Frank's part, but there are instances where he has the glasses up to his face and is this close to putting them on where he could see through them that it just kind of breaks up the fight for me a bit. I admire it technically, but I find it kind of frustrating to watch.Then the movie stops being famous, and we get our confused third act. It's confused because Carpenter isn't really sure what we're all supposed to be mad about. The great sin that gets repeated a couple of times in the latter parts of the film is humans ""selling out"" to the aliens. The homeless encampment is never mentioned as Nada and Frank get together with an underground cell of freedom fighters (sold out by a woman who really should not know where the meeting was happening because the movie never bothers to explain it), and then they end up at the alien headquarters where a human, recently accepted into the alien ranks somehow (this world building is...let's just say incomplete), decides to show them around without any sort of guard. It's here where the ""sin"" is really spelled out, the selling out, and it's odd. I get it in concept, joining up with an oppressive, insidious, and covert alien force that's trying to strip mine the planet, but it's unsupported dramatically. A smarter script would have made that core goal of the aliens part of the first act instead of the homeless camp, but Carpenter was writing from a place of anger and didn't think through his dramatic structure all that well. More ends up getting made of the selling out than the strip mining, and that's why I can't really separate this film's basic point from Carpenter's troubles with the studio system. He had tried to work in it, keeping who he was as an artist intact, but he struggled under the strictures of the organizations and ended up making compromised works that he couldn't really stand behind fully. Going full corporate was selling out to a degree (ironically, his next film, Memoirs of an Invisible Man, is him fully selling out).On a certain level, I get it, the appeal of the movie. The concept is cool and some of the key moments are executed with a certain appreciable style. However, the movie simply doesn't work all that well as an actual story. It's poorly built with jumps in logic and a muddled central point. Being creative purely through emotion has some advantages, but it also has serious drawbacks. If Carpenter hadn't been promised carte blanche from the get go, he might have found the time to hammer out the script a bit more before shooting. As it stands, I find They Live an ultimately frustrating film experience that's more important for a central twenty-minute stretch than actually an enjoyable or engaging story to latch onto.",They Live

Tons of genres are squished into one, wholly enjoyable 90 minutes that not only excites with its sometimes creepy visuals and intense (and hilarious) action sequences, but also provokes with its satirical edge. ""They Live"" is a film made memorable and immortal not only because of its entertainment value and abundance of fun scenes, but also because of its sharp social commentary that is almost Orwellian in nature. Tons has already been said about this movie, and it really is a film worth watching right away as a review cannot truly encapsulate how much excitement and intrigue this film really contains.

91,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An interesting horror thriller that could use some improvement,6,1 October 2017,"Director John Carpenter has been known for many unique films in cinema history. Mainly his forte has been in the horror genre, but he has spilled over into other types of stories that remain just as memorable. Escape From New York (1981), The Thing (1982), The Fog (1980) and Halloween (1978) especially, were the ones he is the most famous for. Even Starman (1984), which was the most deviant of his projects had a heartfelt story. However, if there were something that a lot of his projects had in common, it would be the idea of alien beings inhabiting the human body. It's not in everyone of his movies, but there are a bunch that push the idea of what were to happen if there was life beyond Earth and if they happen to look like us. Would they be threatening like the alien from The Thing (1982)? Or would they be innocent and genuine like Starman (1984). This question is also explored here, but with a different kind of lens. What if aliens ran our lives? At least on an everyday life kind of level.That's more or less what Carpenter examines here. Adapted from a short story originally written by Ray Nelson, the story is about if humans discovered that their lives were being driven by an alien life force and not they themselves. How do they realize this? With the help of sunglasses that actually see right through the impostor human. The person to have the gumption to bring this to light is Nada (Roddy Piper), a drifter. Initially, he was looking to find work to keep his life going. Instead he changes careers to vigilante when he finds out the earth has been subjected to these phony people. Convincing Frank (Keith David), a newly met acquaintance that he's not seeing things, the two set out to stop the invasion. Along the way he also meets Holly (Meg Foster), a broadcaster who reveals to him that all the subliminal messages these aliens put out are through a main signal distributor. For an overall story, it is decent for its setup. But there are certain qualities that are repeated from prior movies.Aliens looking like humans but nobody can tell they aren't humans? Sounds very much like Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978). Although that is not a film Carpenter is directly related to, his film The Thing (1982) has used those key elements before. Here is no different in that respect. What is done in the script that hasn't been seen in other Carpenter films was the use of political undercurrents in an unbiased manner. This is displayed when Nada compares the world around him with and without the special sunglasses. A poster will say ""visit Hawaii"", when really it means ""marry and reproduce"". Other messages like ""watch TV"" or ""don't think independently"" are signs of conformity. These are things corrupt people want to see in the everyday citizen, because the less informed the better. It's a clever spin and instead of the corrupt people in real life causing the issue, it's aliens that look like real people. The other problem this film suffers from is the pacing. Sometimes scenes drag on longer than they should.Character wise Roddy Piper is an entertaining main lead for this film. Widely known for his WWF days, Roddy Piper demonstrates in this flick he can be a convincing actor given the right script. It is interesting though that Carpenter cast him so not to overuse Kurt Russell. However Piper doesn't look that different from Russell, being that he has blond/brown hair, a mullet and plays a tough guy spewing one liners. Keith David as Frank is another great actor. David is known for playing very grounded down to earth characters and he too has some lines that are comical that he exchanges with Piper. Meg Foster is another nice addition to the cast. She of course is cast as one of those complex characters that is tough to determine a motive on. Sadly there's no man villain to really talk about but the aliens that have the human like appearance are the enemy. Although they are not really scary looking, their design is freaky and is more grotesque than anything else. The rest of the visuals are adequate too. Sadly for those looking for gore won't get that in this movie. It's surprising since Carpenter is known for his gruesome spectacles like The Thing (1982) and Prince of Darkness (1987). The practical effects are still noteworthy though. Gary B. Kibbe was credited as cinematographer. Having experience in other camera related positions in movies like Halloween II (1981) and Prince of Darkness (1987), Kibbe keeps the camera focused and clear on the shot needed to be shown. He would later be the cinematographer for In the Mouth of Madness (1994) and RoboCop 3 (1993). Lastly, the music composed by Carpenter and Alan Howarth was probably one of the largest highlights to this piece. Seeing that Howarth is consistent in synthesizer instruments, the score to this film also utilizes these components. What's unique about is that the sound comes across like a smooth jazz western and it works really well since it fits Nada's personality. An underrated film score indeed.While it may drag in some spots, the gore / horror isn't there and there are elements borrowed from other familiar films, the overall experience is still fun to watch. It could have used improvements in those areas but it works okay even with that. The main cast is likable, the script has engaging undertones and the film score is relaxing in its sound.",They Live
92,PredragReviews,Men in Black II: The Search for the Glasses!,7,6 April 2017,"""They Live"" is gloriously over the top and wonderfully eccentric. This is John Carpenter having loads of fun and the audience is along for the ride. A drifter arrives in the city looking for work and a roof over his head. He accidentally stumbles into an alien invasion which no one, apart from a small selection of locals, has noticed. The aliens are disguising themselves by brainwashing everyone through their televisions. It isn't until he finds a pair of sunglasses that have the ability to see past the brainwashing and see who is human and who is alien that he realizes what is really going on.Carpenter often has something to say in his films and here it seems to be that the world being blinded by consumerism and not seeing what is in front of their own eyes. Here the message is a little haphazard and doesn't come across that well as it is lost amongst the outlandish action and over the top set pieces. Carpenter does subversive sci-fi and it's a whole bunch of fun. Stripped back it's evident that ""They Live"" is Carpenter's wry observation on the politico posers who endorse the rich getting richer and everybody else sliding down the pole; to where they stop nobody knows! It's also a blatant paean to the glorious years of the 1950's when paranoia based sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features ruled the air waves. It's also a wonderfully macho driven action movie, laced with comedy as well. You can rest assured there will be plenty of shooting, punching, dodging and spoken lines to make you smile.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",They Live

But instead he rides off into his own world of social parody, violence, and commentary on the foibles of mankind.  Carpenter himself seems bored, and feels the need to toss in an action sequence occasionally. Particularly the _incredibly_ long Piper/David brawl - all because David's damned character won't put on the glasses!  Piper is okay - neither incredibly good nor bad.  He's basically a good action-hero actor...but there are parts of the movie where something a bit subtler is needed.

95,denis888,"Not Perfect, But Highly Elegant And Cool",9,12 June 2017,"This is a semi-forgotten classic of 1988, John Carpenter's lost gem, his acid attack on Reaganomics, consumerism and very clever Left Field critique of a society that thrives on TV and propaganda. The great late Roddy Piper plays Nada, a man who opens a terrible secret to himself and who becomes a powerful warrior for the right cause. Keith David plays his sidekick with his usual gusto, while Meg Foster provides a very brief but nevertheless awesome role of a traitor. You have to watch this excellent movie which shows a typical Alein Invasion thing at a very unusual glance, and what is a bit saddening here, is a lack of proper character development as well as some depth of plot.

Personally, I'm not crazy about Roddy Piper's on-screen presence, let alone his delivery and one-liners. Perhaps, with some leniency, one can observe all that as that fight.A really cool aspect is the sunglasses, or more particularly what can be seen through them.

99,Jeremy_Urquhart,The Citizen Kane of B-movies,8,20 April 2020,"They Live is an example of a perfect B-movie, perhaps my personal favourite B-grade film of all time (with perhaps the exception of 1978's Dawn of the Dead, although I like to think of that as more a ""B+"" movie). Make no mistake though- this doesn't mean I think it's a perfect film- it has its flaws, quite a few actually, but all are acceptable in the context of a low-budget B-movie.The basic plot is absurd, so please excuse the probably awkward explanation of it: They Live is about a homeless man named George Nada (played surprisingly well by Roddy Piper- a wrestler), who wanders around Los Angeles looking for work and trying to get by in life. One day he comes across a pair of sunglasses that allow him to see that the whole world has apparently been blind to the fact that aliens have taken over the Earth and are controlling the entire human population through subliminal messages. While wearing the glasses, Nada can directly see the subliminal messages behind billboards lining the streets of LA- they literally read phrases like ""NO INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT"" and ""OBEY"" when seen through the glasses. Furthermore, the glasses allow Nada to see beyond the disguises the aliens wear- without viewing them through the glasses, the aliens look identical to humans.Once Nada acquires the glasses, he makes it a personal mission of his to shut down the TV station where the aliens are broadcasting much of their controlling messages from- he also finds out that destroying this station will allow all humans to see directly through the disguises of the alien invaders. Oh, and along the way he kills a bunch of aliens with a carefree attitude that many action heroes of the 80s possessed. And it's a heap of fun to watch him do so.If the plot sounds a little silly, it's because it is, but thankfully the film never takes itself too seriously, with its metaphorical tongue being almost constantly planted in its metaphorical cheek. That being said, there is an element of satire to the film which keeps it from being just a mindlessly over-the-top 80s action flick, with clear parallels being made between how the aliens in the film control the population and how the media in real life often wield controlling power over the masses. It's interesting to think about such things briefly, and it's kind of cool that there is a message in the film to ponder, but it's not the film's main focus, and therefore it never feels preachy. It's a little like Romero's Dawn of the Dead in that regard- that film created a parallel between the mindless hordes of zombies and the mindless hordes of individuals who flock to shopping centres, but it never really got in the way of the sense of fun that the film so gleefully possessed. There's some sharp social satire in both films, but never to an overwhelming or unnecessarily pervasive extent.I would love to go into some of my favourite specific scenes, but the bulk of them happen in the second half of the film, and as I found the movie to be refreshingly unpredictable, I'd rather refrain from giving away too many details. I will just say that the first third of the movie is a little slow-going- Nada doesn't find the glasses until about half an hour in, but once he does, the film really picks up, and barely loses any steam on the way to a surprisingly poignant yet hilarious finale.This film is quite well-known for two reasons- the first is its famous line said by Nada about chewing bubblegum and kicking ass, which was referenced in Duke Nukem 3D. It's perhaps more famous now for being said by Duke Nukem, which is a shame, but the line itself without a doubt originated from They Live. The other reason is a one-vs-one fight scene between two characters that happens about halfway through the film which goes on for a stupendously long time- probably too long, but then again its the scene's monumental length that makes it so memorable. The scene is so drawn-out it keeps on flip-flopping between being hilarious and tedious, yet it remains so fascinating to watch because of how openly excessive it is.As I said though, the movie has its problems. The pacing's not great, being that the first 1/3 of the movie is pretty damn uneventful. The music gets a little repetitive too- John Carpenter wrote a decent enough score for the film, but he only seemed to write about 2 minutes worth of actual music, so the same theme gets repeated a lot. The film has an incredibly low budget too, and it's pretty clear throughout, but your mileage may vary on whether that's a truly bad- I kind of think it adds to the movie's charm, and therefore works in its favour. Surprisingly though, I don't have too many bad things to say about the acting. I was expecting a cringe-inducing performance from wrestler from Roddy Piper in the lead (LEAD!) role, but he's surprisingly good, and works well with the material he was given. Keith David is good as always, even if he is sort of the ""black sidekick"" (at least for part of the film). With this performance, Keith David continues to prove that he's one of the best actor's barely anyone knows the name of. The acting from the two leads in this film really is much better than you'd expect, even if it's not Oscar-worthy material or anything.So yeah, I guess I did link this movie to Citizen Kane in the headline. Citizen Kane is almost as perfectly made as any film can be- you don't necessarily have to find it entertaining to acknowledge that. On a purely objective level, it pretty much is a masterpiece of film-making (although I always wished it had a more memorable/ iconic score- seriously, no one can hum the ""theme"" from Citizen Kane). Many people much smarter than myself have written countless words on why Citizen Kane works- see pretty much anything Roger Ebert wrote about that film if you want an idea of why the movie is so highly regarded. Citizen Kane is definitely an ""A-film,"" while They Live is a B-movie. It's nowhere near a perfect movie, but when you take into account its limitations- low budget, non-high profile actors, a smaller filmmaking crew- it's pretty fantastic. Incredibly entertaining, hilarious, unpredictable, and featuring some surprisingly good social commentary, They Live is an under-rated gem that you should seek out and watch, whether you're a B-movie fan or not.",They Live

It was so unexpected and so 80s I really like it.

102,mstomaso,"Clever and fun, with plenty of Carpenter weirdness",7,14 February 2005,"WARNING: The author of this review loves challenging films.They Live is based on a pulp sci-fi story about aliens who live among us and manipulate us through subliminal advertising, other mind control techniques, and sometimes, guns and bulldozers. Like most Carpenter films, its artistic, fun, intelligent and does not take itself too seriously.As usual, Carpenter's casting is brilliant. Roddy Piper plays the good-hearted but not very bright construction worker who is both the hero and protagonist of the film. Keith David, whose character is just a little bit brighter, is his unwilling sidekick. Piper's character sees some strange goings-on in a local church, hears some weird paranoid ramblings from a street preacher, and becomes especially curious when the church is raided by 30-40 police officers and the vagrant camp where he lives is bulldozed one night. Soon after, he finds a pair of sunglasses in the now abandoned church, that literally changes his view of the world around him. The fight scene between David and Piper, while straight out of TV wrestling, is one of the most jarring and bizarre scenes in the movie - it goes on for a very long time - which nicely and subtly points out its significance in moving the plot forward. When Piper finally gets the sunglasses on David's face, he is vindicated and the last shred of doubt about his sanity disappears. From that point forward, they are both committed to saving the world from the alien menace. Further description of the plot would approach a spoiler so I won't go any further. Both of the main characters succeed in dominating the screen, to the point that it is hard to even notice the contributions of the rest of the cast. Both actors are surprisingly good, though understandably typecast (these are, after all, two very big guys) but - who the hell is Keith David? look him up here on IMDb.com and I'm sure you'll be as surprised at I was. He's quite an accomplished character actor. Raymond St Jacques, for all of his five or so minutes of screen time, makes a lasting impression, and Meg Foster is perfect for her ambiguity. Overall, the character development in this film is quite excellent despite the difficulty of pulling it off in a decidedly B sci-fi genre.From an artistic and technical point of view, the film must be judged against Carpenter's other works. Carpenter has practically created his own film genre, and each of his films bears his mark very clearly. Carpenter's camera work is remarkable for its unremarkableness. He chooses not to use gimmicks and allows his cameras to tell the story without embellishing it. Like his version of The Thing, this technique fits very well in this film, as it helps the viewer suspend disbelief in what would otherwise seem as ludicrous as an episode of the X-Files. Carpenter often makes his own soundtracks. Of these, the soundtrack for this film is very good, but terribly repetitive and, after a while, a bit grating. Nevertheless, its goofy redundancy helps to lend a comic edge to the film. Is there a point?I would argue that there is. Carpenter is always more interested in fun than poignancy, but he doesn't shy away from recognizing the value of the material he brings to the screen. Of all of his films, They Live is one of the most overtly political - as it carries some very clever messages about capitalism, conformity, poverty and the horror that everyday life can be for some people. This is all done, however, with a good sense of humor and an almost teenage sense of rebelliousness, all very typically Carpenter. A great film for B-movie fans, intelligent sci-fi fans and those who enjoy film as an art form.",They Live
103,IonicBreezeMachine,"An alien invasion by economics and class disparity, a biting critique of our stratified society",9,31 March 2021,"Set in Los Angeles during a massive recession, the film follows a nameless drifter identified as Nada (Roddy Piper). Upon security employment at a construction job, Nada finds residence within a community of other transients like himself. When a raid on a nearby Church the police storm the transient encampment and scattering the occupants. The following morning as Nada scavenges what little he can from the police rousting that wasn't destroyed, he comes accross a box of sunglasses that when worn show the world is under a mass hypnosis by alien creatures posing as human and using societal disparity to slowly but surely take over. Now armed with knowledge of this invasion Nada goes across Los Angeles intent on knocking down the alien forces.Released in 1988, the film is one of director John Carpenter's more overlooked films. Made for a relatively low budget of $3 million and starring Canadian wrestler Roddy Piper, the movie was treated as a disposable B-movie that although successful disappear quietly from theaters after turning a profit. While the movie can function as a playfully cheesey low budget sci-fi actioneer, the script, the acting, and its underlying satirical subtext make this one of the best Sci-Fi action movies ever made.The script for They Live written by Carpenter under the pseudonym Frank Armitage is based on the short story ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning"" by cartoonist Ray Nelson. With Ray Nelson growing up during the Great Depression, you can definitely feel that authenticity in the material as we see modern day Hooverville equivalents in Reagan era United States with very little different from the Great Depression save for the technology. The opening scenes where the nameless Nada wanders around Los Angeles newly arrived looking for work as we see indifference from the upper classes and the toil and hopelessness of the transients struggling and living hand to mouth is as haunting as any of the images from Carpenter's horror work because of how close to reality it is. They Live is an excellent example of Social Science Fiction, and while other movies have tried to tackle the subject with the dignity of 1984 or the trashiness of The Purge franchise, They Live is probably the only attempt I'd say makes its subject matter approachable without diluting it.While the movie is satirical, the movie remembers it is still an action/horror/sci-fi picture and it does all three just great. The alien designs looking almost like mummified corpses makes them a disgustingly fun antagonist we love to see taken down, and the aliens' usage of facets of modern day society to take down rabblerausers and dissidents results in some frightening imagery that wouldn't have looked too out of place from protests of the past decade.The direction and acting help bring They Live to a standard above and beyond its contemporaries. While Roddy Piper is very much a physical presence more than a vocal one in the movie, the movie plays to Piper's strengths taking an almost Scharzenggian approach that works well with Piper and helps him incorporate his wrestling delivery into the movie in a way that feels organic and entertaining.Piper throughout the movie is a man of few words (per the action hero trope) but when he does talk his casual delivery shows he has a real talent for some terrific one liners and biting jokes that gives him that action star charisma. If this had been a bigger budgeted film with more advertising, I have no doubt that Piper could've been an action star success on equal footing with Schwarzenegger. Keith David as Frank Armitage is also quite good in the movie. David does well playing a family man in the same position as Nada who unlike the more gregarious Nada wishes to just keep his head down and not cause trouble. It's a really good straight man performance to the more exaggerated style of Piper and the two work off each other quite well.They Live is one of the smartest and most entertaining sci-fi action films of the 80s easily standing on equal footing with the likes of RoboCop or Total Recall. While the movie lacks the big budget spectacle present in either of those two films, it makes up for it with a biting sense of satire/humor and a genuinely fun and unique take on alien invasions. While some may disagree with me, They Live is the BEST movie he ever made and I can't recommend it highly enough.",They Live
104,mentalcritic,"""Stealing John Carpenter's Ideas"", the new book by Chris Carter...",9,18 August 2000,"The idea that aliens control our world and secretly pull the strings on which we all dance is nothing new, nor is it particularly unusual. But in They Live, John Carpenter turns it into the almost-ultimate word in satires of American culture at the end of the twentieth century. It would be the ultimate, in fact, if Paul Verhoeven had not beaten him to the punch in the previous year with RoboCop. Both films depict an America that is in the terminal stages of its addiction to capitalism, although they also approach the material from completely different tacks. While RoboCop uses a cog in the increasingly totalitarian wheel to depict a system and a world gone mad, They Live instead tells the tale from the perspective of a total outsider. It is not a coincidence that our central protagonist's name translates into English as ""nothing"". He is a full representation of the ever-growing underclass that the wheel rolls over. Here, John Carpenter's fiendish imagination fleshes out a tale of who really rules in a world where the President is basically an actor.Nada, played with a surprising restraint by Roddy Piper, starts the story as exactly what his name implies. He is nothing, a mere cog in the system that is leaving him without a place to work. As he talks his way into a job on a construction site, one of his new co-workers shows him a place to stay and get food. Coincidentally, it happens to be near a church where some strange goings-on can be observed. Meanwhile, the television set in the nearby outdoor group home is acting up, breaking the program every so often to present a speech that, in fragmentary form, makes little sense. Most of the residents dismiss it as just being the work of a crank, but Nada's curiosity grows until he sneaks into the aforementioned church and discovers that the broadcasts are coming from there. Not long after, the police raid the church, and the people hacking the television signal are scattered to the four winds. But Nada manages to investigate what the police left behind.The moment when Nada opens the box and finds nothing but sunglasses is puzzling, but nothing can prepare one for what soon follows. Putting them on, he discovers that what the man on the hacked television signal has been saying is true. Signs depicting models suddenly bear messages saying ""MARRY AND REPRODUCE"", and it gets even more puzzling from there. It is not until a rich-looking businessman comes to buy a newspaper that the shocking truth becomes fully evident. How John Carpenter so seamlessly pulled off the contrasts between the world we see and that monochrome ""real"" world would make for an amazing audio commentary in itself, but alas, no DVD with this feature exists yet. By most commercial standards, the film was a roaring success, earning over three times its production budget at the box office. Matter of fact, it only cost two-thirds what it cost to make Escape From New York, at least if you believe the IMDb. Carpenter must have kept in practice in the years between these two films, as They Live looks more like it cost fourteen million.As I have intimated in the subject line, Chris Carter must have really liked both The Thing and They Live, as almost all of The X-Files' material is more or less directly lifted from those two films. This, however, is an example of the aliens secretly controlling the world idea done the right way. Knowing that the idea alone is too preposterous for the audience to accept, Carpenter surrounds it with details of the workings of their society within a society. In less time than it takes Carter and company to meander around a single X-Files episode, Carpenter creates a living, breathing alien civilisation. He expertly suspends reality in graduating steps. It is not until the second act that we get the idea that all is not what it seems, and then it is only for brief flashes. Our hero reacts in much the same manner as any of us would. First by having doubts about his sanity, then by hedonistically exploiting the situation. It is not until the final act that our heroes get it into their heads to do something about it. By this time, the monochrome effects showing the aliens in their true form are minimised. It has the pleasant side effect of emphasising that the heroes now see clearly.If there is a weakness in They Live, it may be that the pacing is off. Scenes that establish the problem and its solution go by in less than a minute at times, but a brawl between the two main characters takes more than five minutes. There also seems to be a sense that the resistance network shown consists of only one cell somewhere in America. Perhaps this was the effect that Carpenter wanted, but it does throw the viewer out of the film at times. Roddy Piper is not the best actor, but this part literally has his name all over it. His dialogue in the bank robbery could only have come out of his mouth. This soon gave rise to the Wrestler Rule: when you want a character to sound boisterous nine out of ten times, cast a former professional wrestler. Keith David does not let the side for ""real"" actors down, either. His portrayal of slowly becoming more of a believer is what keeps the viewer in the reality of the film during much of its latter half.I gave They Live a nine out of ten. I paid something like thirteen American dollars to buy it from Amazon, and I felt it was money well-spent. I can mention it in the same breath as RoboCop, and that is not an easy thing for a film to achieve. It is a perfect postcard of the 1980s. See it post-haste.",They Live
105,Joxerlives,"Brilliant but flawed film, out of it's time in many ways",7,22 October 2012,"Loved John Carpenter in the late 70s and early 80s, he really was brilliant. He lost it in the mid 80s and They Live is his last hurrah. A not-so-subtle allegory of the Regan revolution blaming the growing gap between the rich and poor on an alien invasion and mass brainwashing (rather than the inherent weakness of human nature). However once the film moves beyond the initial shock of Nada's revelation it dies on its' feet. Good things? The wonderful Meg Foster who effortlessly improves any film she ever graces with her presence. Nada's terrific scene where he robs the bank, reminiscent of Jesus throwing the moneylenders out of the temple, so great that Roddy Piper actually improvised his classic 'bubblegum' line. Nada gleefully blowing away the aliens but disarming and letting the human cop go because he genuinely doesn't know what's going on and thinks he's fighting 'commie terrorists'. The longest fight in cinema history. The fact that money is stamped 'This is your god'. The terrific ending. Bad things? It rather stretches credibility that the aliens are supposed to be the rulings class yet take working stiff jobs such as cops and bank security guards? Isn't it a bit of a stretch that Keith David's character gives Nada two weeks pay after he slaughters dozens? Nada's everlasting magazine on his MP5. A great film but one more suited to the post-Watergate cynicism of the 70s (and the more thoughtful sic-fi it generated, Silent Running, Soylent Green, THX 1138) rather than the peak of the Regan revolution of the 80s, the triumph of capitalism over communism (and competing with the bombastic appeal of Predator, Robocop and The Hidden)",They Live

107,hnt_dnl,My favorite John Carpenter movie!,10,1 August 2012,"THEY LIVE (1988) is one of those ""80s"" movies that eluded me as I was growing up. The two adjectives that you hear most about ""80s"" movies are 'dated' and 'trivial'. But a funny thing has happened to movies in the 00s. Most movies now are really indistinguishable from each other, no matter what the genre. Summer movies are big on special effects, with no story or good characters. Non-summer movies are either boring Indie flicks or dull mainstream bids to win Oscars. And every other movie is now a remake or a reboot! But in the 80s, it seemed like a movie could be about almost ANYTHING and still be entertaining! Even a lot of ""bad"" ones are getting re-discovered as cult classics! Go figure.They Live is another 80s movie that has managed to reach the level of cult status, but that's not surprising given the source...John Carpenter! Who is fast moving up my list of favorite directors! I already had been a big fan since the 80s of his no-holds-barred cult action comedy Big Trouble in Little China and have recently gotten around to watching (and loving!) his atmospheric and spooky horror flick The Fog. There's a nonchalance and unassuming quality with which Carpenter directs his flicks that is really inviting. He doesn't overdo it with camera action or music. Rather, he focuses on the characters and dialog allow them to drive the action, rather than the other way around, and sets a tone and mood that permeates throughout his movies. They Live starts off very methodical and slow, establishing the main character and a couple of minor ones very well while setting an ominous, foreboding tone, and once it gets going, it REALLY gets going! It had been years since I'd seen it until recently, but I remember totally liking this effort and now have come to appreciate for how psychic and clever it really is!They Live stars 80s wrestling icon Roddy Piper (in a surprisingly persuasive performance) as a ""John Doe"" style drifter who finds work at an LA construction site. There he meets fellow worker Frank (a solid Keith David) and the 2 live at a local shelter that is run by Gilbert (reliably played by Peter Jason, who later played a role in Carpenter's anthology flick Body Bags). Piper's character finds out that the shelter is a front for a secret organization, that gets raided by the police, but not before Piper finds a box of sunglasses in the group's hideout. After donning a pair of the glasses, he sees the light! The world has been infiltrated by aliens who have worked their way up through societal ranks and hold key positions of power and authority (businessmen, police, newscasters, politicians) and all the signs and media carry subliminal messages that force the general populace to conform, submit, and obey! Then there is this long sequence where Piper discovers the magnitude and scope of the alien threat via the sunglasses that is truly spooky and scary, and he proceeds to go on an alien-killing spree! During his escape, he kidnaps a local yuppie named Holly (played by the beautiful Meg Foster in an all-too-small role) and tries to convince her of the alien threat.While They Live has several moments of hilarity (most notably in some of Piper's dialog) and has a comic air about it at times, it is mostly a serious film with an important message. Piper's blasé dialog actually complements the horror and action scenes as it's coming from a character that is at a crossroads in his life: he's homeless, with little to no hope of a good future, and is in ""last straw"" mode, BUT he also has a heart (as illustrated in his connections with both Holly and Frank) and morals and defeating the aliens is his way of saying that he does count and can make a difference.Yeah, I know it all sounds cheesy and cliché, but the movie never feels like that to me. While the effects are cheap (which is intended since this is a very low budget B movie) and the dialog is purposefully tongue-in-cheek, the message and the way Carpenter tells the story is most certainly NOT cheesy or cornball! They Live is actually one of the more provocative low-budget flicks I've ever seen! The drab black-and-white world that is relayed through the sunglasses is actually pretty scary-looking, relaying a cold and empty feeling. The movie is actually pretty disturbing and violent, with the big alleyway fight scene, as well as the attacks on the shelter and the underground basement, and of course in the climax. The main stars Piper, David, and Foster really do a great job with the serious moments and making the viewer believe in the imminent threat.The film's ending is simply smashing, simultaneously ambiguous and yet somehow uplifting. They Live is a pleasing blend of horror, satire, comedy, action and is grounded in a lot of truth! My fave from John Carpenter!",They Live
108,ODDBear,B-movie social satire spoof,7,4 April 2006,"Set in the near future (made in 1988), a drifter that goes by the name of Nada discovers that aliens have invaded society and are governing the earth. Using hidden messages to propel obedience, encourage massive consumerism, not question authority etc. Nada can distinguish these aliens from ordinary humans by using special sunglasses and soon he joins an army of rebels that set out to uncover the truth for all the people to see.It's called a sci/fi action film that's armed with a social conscience but it's really just a low budget spoof by master horror director John Carpenter. Carpenter's ventures into other genres usually turn out pretty well. He made the best film about legendary rock'n roll performer Elvis Presley, a heartfelt romantic film with Starman and a relatively successful Chevy Chase comedy Memoirs of an Invisible Man. Carpenter has tackled action films before and more successfully with Assault on Precinct 13 and Escape From New York, he's quite literally proved himself to be able to take on any cinematic genre. They Live works best as a funny and violent social satire aiming it's guns squarely at the Reagan administration. The ever increasing gap between the rich and the poor, the ever so growing consumerism and the pursuit for wealth (in essence; greed) are explained here in a fun fashion but it's not to be taken too seriously. This is John Carpenter in B-movie mode and few are better in this territory than him.Some usual Carpenter traits are present; such as his trademark moody music score (composed by himself and Alan Howarth) that sets a cool tone for the film and a familiar scenario involving ordinary people getting caught up in circumstances for which they have no control over and rise to the occasion. As usual in a Carpenter film, the protagonist here is more in the anti-hero department (you could easily envision Snake Plissken, had he not chosen the criminal path) and he's very well realized in the hands of ex-wrestler Roddy Piper. Piper displays a reasonable amount of acting talent and looks good in one of cinema's longest (but very amusing) fight scenes. In fact all the cast do a splendid job here.They Live isn't John Carpenter at his best but it's a fun diversion all the same. Fans of him will probably enjoy the film more than others, it's fairly slowly paced despite it's relatively short running time, it's not exactly chock full of action but it's cleverly written (by Carpenter under the alias Frank Armitage) and overall has a lot going for it. That fight scene alone is worth the price of admission.",They Live

What's worse is they have enslaved us humans, since all the wealthy appear to be aliens, suffice to say Nada joins forces with Frank (Keith David) and later with the rebellion to stop these creatures once and for all. When They Live came out, I must admit I had low expectations. With a professional wrestler (Ahem, No Holds Barred) and a cover that didn't exactly inspire greatness, how wrong I was, as They Live is easily the best movie to date that has starred a wrestler. (Yes better than The Princess Bride, although just a little bit) They Live has such wild imagination as well as unpredictable twists, that the movie lets us buy into the fantasy of the premise. The movie's message is one that has aged quite well, in fact it's politics have gotten even better with age. They Live does have its weaknesses (Mainly in Meg Foster's character) but typically this is very enjoyable and compulsively watchable stuff.* * *1/2 out of 4-(Very good)",They Live
110,one9eighty,Laser surgery for yours eyes and senses to prepare you for the slavery you live in,7,8 February 2016,"Now here's a cult classic and great film. I remember watching this as a child in the eighties, as a wrestling fan I instantly recognised mullet haired ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper in the central role, and as a fan of horror seeing John Carpenters name on it was more than enough of a reason to watch it. I enjoyed this film then and fast forward twenty or so years later I still enjoyed it when it happened to be on a late night horror channel. A drifter going from town to town finds some sunglasses which reveal to him the reality of the suburban jungle he is living in. Aliens have been living amongst us for sometime and society is being drip an agenda to maintain it's conformity and consumerism while keeping it numb and dancing unaware to the sound of the rich and powerful drummers in servitude and subconscious slavery. It's up to ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper as Nada, to tell the world and then save it. There may have been goofs and gaffs galore in this film but if you are looking for those you have missed the point of the film, it may be tongue in cheek at times but this was an attack on the American political system in place in the 1980's, an attack on Regan, greed, capitalism, conformity, poverty and mass consumerism. While it was created in the 80's and is about the 80's take a step back and ask yourself if the film could still be relevant today, the answer is of course it is. Nothing has changed at all and the film is as valid now as it was at the time of it's release in the 80's - albeit slightly dates in appearance. What this film cleverly does without you realising is it adjusts your vision; you can step out your front door and if you remember some of the content of the film you can see without glasses that those things depicted are the realities that we live in today. I am constantly surprised by the amount of people who haven't seen this growing up, it's harmless yet meaningful, it's action packed yet family friendly, it's bad but good all at the same time. Definitely worth a watch and a whopping 7 out of 10 on my 'difficult to please' rating system. I'd happily watch this again, any time, which I can't say for a lot of modern films.",They Live
111,phubbs,They Live,8,16 November 2014,"Probably one of the most overlooked and underrated films by Carpenter yet possibly his most clever. All his own work and a quite beautiful look at how paranoia and fear within an ever decreasing economy can be exploited for a good story.Now I'm not saying all Americans are suspicious conspiracy theory doom mongers but this film exposes that ever present trait whilst also scratching at the notion of constant gross consumer consumption, greed and subversive subliminal messages touching on hypnosis and domination.To be honest the whole idea just shows how some Americans (including Carpenter) think most of the time, always looking over their shoulder and suspicious.As for the film its a romp that just keeps going and you wanna know how it ends. The start is slow and dull, it takes time to get going but once Nada finds the sunglasses of truth things get really interesting in a good way. I love how Carpenter made this film, its dated but still looks great as it has that nice B-movie look which is mainly down to the budget. Think of it as an unintentional result that happens to fit the whole films concept perfectly. Classic 50's alien B-movie fluff enhanced with time.The whole idea is really very clever and imagined so well. We see the alien corrupted world controlling the now unaware obedient humans in their daily lives through the black and white shades Nada finds. Without the shades the world appears normal, an illusion created to blinker or fog human eyes.The aliens only appear when the shades are on and boy do they look creepy. Even though its obviously a simple mask the makeup and design is superbly created and really gives an eerie effect. That skeletal skull look with those quite scary eyes!I have always been surprised with the great performance by Piper also. The guy was a WWF wrestler at the time for Gods sake yet his acting here is great, just perfect. He really carries off the suspicion and awakening of the story to a tee. As for his character of Nada...all I can say is the guy certainly has an element of Jack Burton if you ask me. 'I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass...and I'm all out of bubblegum'I also like how this film isn't predictable. It keeps you guessing and you're never sure how it will end or who will survive.The subtle political jabs, crazy ass humour and out n out action is a curious blend but like Carpenter's 86 film 'Big Trouble in Little China' he manages to pull it off with ease and create another cult on his filmography.

112,Mister-6,Roddy Piper Conquers the Martians...,7,18 January 2000,"Or something like that.  At any rate, ""They Live"" proves once and for all that 1) John Carpenter was always a master of atmosphere, 2) Roddy should make more movies like this and 3) aliens are the root of all evil. The plot in a nutshell - Roddy is a drifter who discovers sunglasses that enable him to see that aliens have infiltrated our society as socially affluent yuppies and only a small band of renegade humans can save the world from staying ""asleep"" and being mentally and subliminally conquered by them.I always liked stories like this, but the way Carpenter approaches this is like an '80s version of the Red Scare: only this time it's aliens, not Russians, who walk among us.  The effects, while not outstanding, are good enough to make the story acceptable.  And that fight between Roddy and Keith David, while draining, is still worth watching in the same way the old bar room brawls between John Wayne and any unlucky cow poke would be.  Maybe not innovative but remember, one of those guys is a professional wrestler!Carpenter's direction doesn't disappoint - he still maintains his usual ""one-good-solid-shock-per-film"" quota, but the story, while entertaining, just doesn't seem as original at a second glance.  The last few minutes of film, which I wouldn't reveal for anything, are pretty entertaining and give their money's worth.  All in all, ""They Live"" make for an entertaining experience.  And if you always expected something funny about the rich and affluent, even better.Seven stars and an autographed pair of sunglasses for ""They Live"", Roddy's finest hour.TIDBIT - there's a part where Roddy grumbles, ""I've come to chew bubble gum and kick a**, and I'm all out of gum.""

Though not a true classic, They Live is an engaging Orwellian-type urban thriller. Rowdy Roddy Piper (in a surprisingly effective performance) plays an unnamed drifter who finds a low level construction job and takes up residence in some type of squatter's camp near downtown L.A.. Things look like they still look in most U.S. cities today. The poor are desperate, and the rich seem to keep getting richer. But it seems that some of the residents of this camp are using the church across the street as a kind of a resistance center. But resistance to what? After putting on a pair of special sunglasses he finds at the church, Piper learns a terrifying secret. The well to do are actually aliens whose identities are revealed by the glasses. All sources of media are also subliminally ordering people to consume, obey, and procreate. Small drone aircraft buzz overhead to keep watch on things. The aliens seem to have people totally under their spell. When Piper tips his hand at his ability to see the aliens for what they are, he becomes a hunted man. Can he stay alive long enough to help the resistance expose the entire alien scheme? Who can he trust, if anyone?They Live has too many serious over and undertones for it to be simply dismissed as a low budget exploitation flick. Still it relies heavily on old fashioned shootouts and ass whipping to get its point across. There is nothing subtle about it, despite its low-key first act. Piper is about as subtle as a cinder block thrown through a stained-glass window. At one point, he and Keith David have a long fight that seemed to be like a choreographed Wrestle Mania encounter. It brought plenty of guffaws from the audience. The conclusion is awfully abrupt, too. But this is still a solid and diverting picture, and as timely as ever. In this country, the gap between rich and poor is ever-widening. And people seem less inclined than ever before to ""put on the glasses"" and take a hard look at things.

115,eminkl,"This is a perfect genre feature: death-defying, jam-packed, exciting, manic, and a little cheesy.",8,13 December 2019,"John Carpenter's damnation of the controlling mass media and the self-centered ruling class in 1988's terrific ""They Live"" might be wiggy - consider that the hero is played by a professional wrestler, that the film features one of the longest, most bizarre fight scenes in movie history, and that its understanding of physics is a shakier than my hands after drinking two cups of black coffee on an empty stomach - but wigginess doesn't always equal shoddiness and Carpenter wisely contemplates all the necessary precautions before going for deep-throated satire. Because the guy's apt and a dependable filmmaker when it comes to reinvention in the genres H.P. Lovecraft loved the most, just about everything about ""They Live"" is effective. It's broad, sure, but its mania is endearing, and Carpenter's cultural observations are so sharp and so solidified that the frenzy surrounding his full-bodied lampooning only polishes his stance. An abundance of self-seriousness and we'd have a no-fun arthouse feature, so welcome is ""They Live's"" pulp imitating cheekiness. The movie stars Roddy Piper as an unnamed, down-on-his-luck drifter (the closing credits refer to as ""Nada"") in the slums of Los Angeles looking for work. Shortly after a montage decides that finding a job ain't as easy a task as the bourgeoisie would think, Nada gets a construction gig that temporarily puts an end to his lack of prosperity. But Nada's world is rocked when the local shantytown is massacred by what appears to be law enforcement officials. With the attack coming hours after being a captive audience member to a blind preacher's (Raymond St. Jacques) ramblings about some form of world domination on the part of beings from outer space, things are awfully suspicious - especially so when Nada stumbles across a box of sunglasses left over in the wreckage. Moments after he puts a pair on, though, does the world, in a ""Matrix"" twist, become gnarled beyond belief. Through this new accessory does Nada see everyday existence for what it really is: a black-and-white wasteland where the upper class are vicious, very literal monsters controlling those beneath them through the media. Advertisements suddenly read ""obey,"" ""marry and reproduce"" instead of ""buy this computer,"" ""travel to the Caribbean""; persons of interests are distinguished by their looking up like kids dressing up as Skeletor. Because it's unappealing to see a reality so frightening, Nada takes it upon himself to join a resistance group and fight the power. But since the patriarchy is much more dangerous than it's been cracked up to be all these years, the man, though burly and weary, may not be able to survive for as long as he'd figure himself to be able to. Perhaps no one would survive as for as long as Nada, however - what we have in him is an almost comically tough quasi-fighter who'd give Schwarzenegger a run for his money if his mullet didn't make him so distinctly uncool. ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass,"" he iconically proclaims to a group of fiends at one point during the film. ""And I've just finished my bubblegum."" If that isn't the best one-liner in an action movie and if Nada isn't the most underrated anti-hero since Franco Nero, then I'm Bruce Lee's cousin. So exquisite is the way Carpenter's so deftly able to make a durable, horror-tinged action comedy with as many perceptive tunings of social commentary as unfiltered stabs of delight. This is a perfect genre feature: death-defying, jam-packed, exciting, manic, and a little cheesy. ""They Lives"" is among Carpenter's finest films.",They Live

117,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Watch,9,27 November 2007,"The story here is ridiculously simple. A guy named Nada, who is a drifter of sorts, finds a very special pair of sunglasses that enable him to see past the facade of society and at the disturbing truth that it hides. The result is a brilliantly executed film that walks the fine line between utter hilarity and all out horror.There are many memorable scenes in ""They Live"" but the one that sticks most would have to be the one when Nada sees downtown Los Angeles through the sunglasses. The bleak and hopelessly dystopian view is all the more shocking that most people don't know about and, as a result, have accepted it. Rather they have been conned into accepting it, but the difference is just the same. The pessimism of the film is balanced with some great black comedy. The scene where Nada walks into a bank is simply priceless. The video game ""Duke Nukem 3D"" even took the immortal one liner from that scene for its own use years later. Having played that game back in junior high school, I had no idea that it was actually from this film. Interesting is the fact that ""Duke Nukem 3D"" and video games like it fall into the very category of things that this film is clearly against. Another great thing is the film's ending. The ending manages to combine action-hero badassness (is that even a real word?) with great comic timing and still be intelligent enough to leave you thinking.Funny, exciting, and daring this is a very important movie that all should see at least once. --- 9/10 Rated R for violence.

But the pace of the movie is a bit too slow in my opinion and the acting pretty lame.

120,AhmedSpielberg99,"Long Live, Carpenter!",8,26 October 2018,"From his movies I've watched so far, I can say that Carpenter's movies share a cool style of direction, cool ideas, and cool characters. But They Live has something more.... a cool way of unraveling and unfolding the plot!Carpenter here unfurls his movie's story as if he says to his audience: ""I don't care whether you're enjoying the movie or not. You came here for the movie's bizarre and outlandish concept, and here it is!"".Not too much dialogue; the thing that may make the viewer feel a bit bored, especially before the action rises. But so what as long as this brilliantly reflects the movie's themes of working-class subjection and media control!A very slow way of resolving the conflict of the plot; the thing that may infuriate the viewer, and make him worried lest the denouement would be so rushed. But so what as long as the results, as the movie proceeds and the end result, are more than fulfilling and rewarding!In all honesty, Carpenter went a bit too far to say the least. As the transitions between an act to another are quite abrupt and scrappy that can make you feel as if something is missing; something that is necessary to make you more convinced. The transition between the first and the second act can redeemed; because there is an information that is represented later at the second act in a most subtle way. But this is not the case about the transition between the second and the third act. As there are some things that should have been quite difficult to work out, but they ended up being solved pretty quick by some coincidences and plot holes. Let alone the major plot hole concerns the whole story that you may realize at the end, if not while watching the movie.It goes without saying that in They Live, Carpenter offers a timeless biting and daring political satire neatly encapsulated in a loony thought-provoking sci-fi flick while maintaining, at its core, its B-movie quality the genius director famous for.(8/10)",They Live

But I finally caught it the other night and had myself a ball. The movie has some great lines - ""I'm here to chew bubble gum and kick ass - and I'm all out of bubble gum!"" and a hilarious 10 minute fist fight between Roddy Piper and Keith David. This is a movie with tongue firmly in cheek and is one of John Carpenter's most memorable films. It revolves around construction worker Piper picking up a pair of sunglasses that enable him to detect that aliens have infiltrated the human race, and good ol' Roddy soon puts Arnie and Stallone to shame!Great fun.",They Live
122,vostf,There's something about Carpenter,7,24 August 2002,"For some people John Carpenter is only a bum doing low-budget movies and that's all. This is the American global point of view: people want their money's worth so they feel better if a film costed a hundred million dollars, including top-class FX and a big star with his star on the Walk of Fame and a $20m fee (plus %).Okay but hence they can't see what Carpenter is really good at. It's not being lenient with his movies to say so. Carpenter got used to work with a reduced crew so that it is not possible for him to be himself with a big budget. Assault on precinct 13 and The Thing are his major achievements to me. With Assault he showed us how good he could do with very little. The Thing stands as the maximum he can do with a bigger budget without going into a coma after he's had a close look at everything from development thru post-production.To sum it up in Carpenter's movies directing is in the foreground. To see only the cheap aspect is like watching for goofs. There's much more fun in just getting in the movie.They LiveThe way Carpenter builds his narrative with John Nada, the poor lonesome cowboy in modern days LA, is great. Thus it's important to see They Live without knowing much about the plot. If you read the outline you'll certainly find the first hour too slow-paced. The last part with Nada fighting the villains along with a side-kick is less good since it's really difficult to look good with a low budget went it comes to action. Anyway Carpenter's directing is much more effective when danger is here and nowhere (Assault, Halloween, The Fog, The Thing); or we have to be with a Snake Plisken character, kicking asses from time to time, right from the start.",They Live

124,ersinkdotcom,"John Carpenter's ""They Live"" delivers fun scares and social commentary.",6,24 November 2012,"John Carpenter has an interesting track record of films. Many are considered cult classics like ""Halloween,"" ""The Thing,"" and ""Escape from New York."" Others are held in high esteem by some and shunned by others. I'm referring to ""The Fog,"" ""Prince of Darkness,"" and ""Vampires."" A select few are seen as outright disasters. One prime example everyone would agree on would be ""Ghosts of Mars."" A film that seems to fall just a little shy of being considered a shining example of his work is ""They Live.""Two drifters try to make ends meet while working construction and living in a shanty town. One of the men, Nada (Roddy Piper), begins to notice suspicious activities occurring in the church across the street. He investigates and finds a small group of people who discovered aliens have taken over the world and dominate us subliminally through hidden messages delivered via television, billboards, newspapers, and magazines. The only way someone can see who is or isn't an alien is by putting on sunglasses that act as x-rays and expose the otherworldly intruders. Nada must find a way to convince his friends and fight back against the evil beings.It's obvious that writer Frank Armitage is using aliens as a representation of corporations, the government, and the controlling upper class in ""They Live."" He clearly has issues with anyone trying to oppress the ""little"" guy or the less fortunate. His story works beautifully as a sort of parable exposing this idea.Where the movie breaks down is in its pacing. The set-up, beginning, and end of the film move along quite nicely. Things start to drag a bit in some middle spots, but it doesn't completely ruin the viewing experience. It redeems itself every time the sunglasses are put on and we get a glimpse ""behind the curtain.""The age of ""They Live"" is clearly seen in its visual effects. The alien faces look like rubber masks but still look good for a low-budget sci-fi / horror film in 1988. This doesn't make it unwatchable. If anything, it adds a feeling of nostalgia and appreciation for this genre masterwork.Although I wouldn't put ""They Live"" on the same level as ""The Fog"" or ""Halloween,"" it still deserves a mid-range spot in John Carpenter's repertoire.",They Live

127,Aylmer,Intelligent scifi film following lunkheaded protagonist,7,12 October 2015,"Carpenter's Golden Era fizzled out somewhere in the late 80's between PRINCE OF DARKNESS and this movie. This film has some amazing scenes and excellent ideas though not without its share of campy silliness and sloppiness which adds to the fun. Still, I can't help but wonder how much better this film would have been with a few more dollars and a lot more attention put on making sure the script was up to snuff.Conceptually, this film is great with a plot that nearly writes itself. Unfortunately, it settles into total conventions and the plot never really has any sense of reality or immediacy to it because things are so sloppily set up in the first act.Right at the start I've always chuckled a bit right when Piper walks into the unemployment office and a guy in a wheelchair scoots by him just unsubtly shaking his head in frustration. Things feel even sillier when it turns out that a blind street preacher Piper sees raving to some crowd of strangers is some central figure in the human resistance. Wouldn't they try to maintain a lower profile? Also, how are they so taken off guard by the police raid but never seem to notice the giant 7- foot blond wrestler in a plaid shirt parked across the street aiming binoculars at them all day and night?Like everyone else, I love how a heavily armed Piper pulls a reverse- HEAT and escapes a police shootout by entering a bank and shooting the place up. This awesome scene is undone immediately after by Piper just easily exiting the back door (are cops really this stupid?). It could have all been so much better to have the bystanders reacting more realistically (especially to their kin talking into wristwatches and disappearing) but Carpenter can't seem to be bothered by that and just whisks the plot along to a lot of unfortunately repetitive and uninspired action sequences involving dozens of nameless henchmen in ill-fitting army surplus store uniforms.Piper gives us an earnest performance as a clumsy hobo who suddenly wakes up to reality, but the real star performance belongs to Keith David. As much goofy fun as the 6-minute fight scene is, I'd have much rather seen a fight focus on a point in the film where the stakes were larger or devoted more time to Keith's conversion or setup. The film makes a lot of right turns when a few lefts might have made for something truly classic. As it is, the film falls just short, though it'll always retain a strong cult following for its pre-MATRIX social commentary mixed with fast-paced action and Carpenter delivery the (unfortunately?) cheesy goods, true to his standard.",They Live
128,Space_Mafune,Entertaining if Flawed,7,13 December 2002,"THEY LIVE tries to be both a social statement and an action film and doesn't entirely succeed in either area. Both do provide their moments though. The best scenes in the entire film are the wild subliminal  world underneath the real world Nada sees when he first puts on the glasses. Now this is a wild idea I would like to see examined a little more in film. While we all know there's a ring of truth in what is revealed to Nada here - In reality things aren't quite that black an white. Good and evil can not be so easily determined. The action stuff is sometimes good with loads of violent and exaggerated gun battles but the film seriously lacks logic here too as people do things which are totally impossible. Still if you don't think too much about it and overlook the plot holes and illogic of the ending, you'll have fun watching it. Basically if you enjoy action films it's a good romp.

Roddy Piper is cool in the main role (especially for me, because I like him in WWF too) and Meg Foster is gorgeous. Still, movie kinda falls apart when Nada goes full Rambo on the aliens, but it still remains a fun experience to the end. There is also a long fighting scene in the alley between Nada and Frank, which is probably in the movie just because of Piper's wrestling career. Especially cool scene is when at the movie's end Carpenter mentions himself and Romero in a joke. All in all, you won't go wrong with this one.

I was thrilled by the plot and if IMDB existed back then, it would be a straight 10! But I was 10 years younger, i.e. 14 years old. I saw it again today; I appreciated the way the plot evolves (slowly without logical gaps, something I really miss in a lot of movies), till the point the hero finds out what's going on (which is about at the 30th min of the movie). I highly recommend these 30 min because you can really get inside the atmosphere. But after that, it was a let down. I found a lot of trigger-happiness (everything evolves around guns) and this extremely tiring fighting scene. I cannot stand one minute of fistfight (so boring if it isn't for real) and with this I was bored even by pressing the FF key on the remote!A good film for those who are conspiracy theorists and don't find continuous use of violence unnecessary and diverting from the subject, or for those who want to see just a shallow action movie.

They Live is based on a Short Story called Eight O'Clock in the Morning, the screenplay is written by John Carpenter using the name Frank Armitage. The film sees a drifter named John Nada going into the city for some work, he soon finds work at a construction sight and finds a place to live with the help of a worker named Frank. Strange things keep happening with TV's a broadcasts are constantly held warning people about what's really going on in the world, John finds something strange going on in the church and decides to check it out, inside he finds that a group of people are broadcasting the messages here, at night they're all suddenly attacked by Riot Officers. John escapes and the next day goes into the church to investigate some more, he soon finds a box containing sunglasses, he decides to take one and when he puts it on he sees what the world is really like. Signs, money, books all tell us what to do but we don't even see it, devices are on traffic lights, small ships fly over monitoring everyone and the people who really control us are Aliens that are disguised as us. After causing a disturbance in a store John is confronted by Police officers who are also Aliens, after killing them he takes there weapons and goes into a bank where he finds more of them and shoots them all before escaping, John holds a women named Holly Thompson hostage and she takes him to her house but when he is distracted she knocks him out the window. On the run from law John meets up with Frank who doesn't want to get involved.

I hadn't really seen many John Carpenter movies before this one, and I hadn't really heard many reviews about it, so I thought I was taking a risk buying it. Turned out to be a great movie. Roddy Piper did an awesome portrayal as ""Nada"", a nobody who wanders into town one day and joins a small slum on the outskirts of town. He makes friends with Frank (Keith David), who had moved from his family to find work. They soon discover a church across the street is sending signals through their TV's. A bearded man (John Lawrence) would appear on the screen and tell them that they are being controlled through their TVs. Nada wanders in one day and is confronted by a blind Street Preacher (Raymond St. Jacques). Soon the church is raided and their organization starts to fall apart, then Nada discovers sunglasses which reveal the truth, which is, that many people walking around are actually aliens from the Andromeda galaxy, and that they control society.

135,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,25 April 2005,"Carpenter rounded off his eighties career with They Live, an action and sci-fi mix with all the usual Carpenter traits, but which also works as a propaganda piece, and seems to have influenced films such as The Matrix. It is a film about unseen forces controlling us, about speaking out and taking action, rather than sitting back and accepting that what you see is the way the world should be. Featuring many good ideas, minimal and cool dialogue, shady characters and unlikely heroes, They Live is considered by many as Carpenter's last good film, though I have enjoyed most of what he has done since.The film begins with a drifter walking into town, looking for any sort of work. His name is Nada, though this is never said, and he eventually finds work at a building site. There he meets Frank who introduces him to his slum neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city. Pirate TV broadcasts tell of the upper class getting richer, and the middle class being drained. Nada sees that these broadcasts are coming from a nearby church, but is warned not to get involved or the cops will take him away. When one day the church is raided, Nada finds a box of sunglasses. When he wears a pair he begins to see things- advertisements turn to slogans such as 'sleep' and 'obey', and realises that aliens are walking disguised amongst them, mostly the rich people. He grabs a gun and begins killing them, trying to find out why, who, from where etc. He meets Holly who works for a TV station and tries to convince her, but she doesn't believe him and calls the cops. After a long fight Nada manages to give Frank a pair, and he too sees what has been hidden from the public. They find the people who made the glasses, and set out to stop the aliens who are using humans, and other planets as resources for their own wealth.This works as a social commentary on class, wealth, the politics of the time, and as an anti-war message for today. Invasion and subtle control are tolerated until a few rebels realise the truth and fight back. We should not be content with buying what we think makes us look good and become numb and dumb. Roddy Piper of WWF fame gives a fine performance as Nada, and of course his strength is exploited. Keith David is as strong as always, and Foster looks chilling and distant. The effects are still effective even if they do resemble something from the forties, and the story is good. After a slow start things speed up towards a typically Carpenter ending. This is another good film by Carpenter which lacks the best scares of The Thing and the fun of Big Trouble, but still is greatly entertaining and worth watching.8 out of 10",They Live
136,charchuk,Entertaining with an obvious message,6,11 April 2007,"Fairly entertaining, but pretty dumb and way too heavy-handed with its message. I mean, I have no problem with biting satire, but can you get any more obvious than huge messages all over the city? Not very subtle. The concept of humanity being 'asleep' is an interesting one, but would be done much better a decade later in The Matrix. Roddy Piper does his best Arnold Schwarzenegger, and dissolves from an interesting character to a generic action hero by the end, but has some classic lines (""I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubble gum!"") and possibly the best 'fall out of a window' scene ever. There's also an incredibly long and random fight scene between him and Keith David that, while fun to watch, is pretty terribly choreographed - it's obvious they're not hitting each other. It also comes right out of nowhere. By the end, any semblance of a serious satire has been replaced by another generic '80s action flick. A fun watch, but that's about it.",They Live

At first you think he's acting or something, but as soon as things heat up he's spluttering and ranting like he's having Piper's Pit flashbacks. ""Formaldehyde Face!""

With subliminal messages as ""OBEY"", ""CONFORM"", ""MARRY AND REPRODUCE"", ""CONSUME"", ""WATCH TELEVISION"" and ""SLEEP"" everywhere, it is seen as all to easy to succumb to this train of thought, this sleepwalking of the living, the lifeless Souls that are never truly awake. It is through this thought control and the paranoia's that exists within this modern world that the aliens have this world tied up and neatly packaged for its own manipulative uses, to further themselves at the expense of the meek, mild and the lowly sufferers of a jobless, homeless, hungry and cold world.This is the battle of self-awareness and one mans struggle with a reality check that has these alien beings staging war against the up-rising and rebellious armies from the gutters and streets.

But far way back, before those guy hit the big screen and somewhat redeemed themselves from the bad reputation, The Hot Rod himself teamed up with the master of horror to star as the lead in a science fiction short story adaptation. It's indeed an odd couple to helm such a project, but the outcome was not as disastrous as I expected. First of all, the whole concept of the story is extremely multilayered and combines a lot of interesting topics, such as social criticism and sublime repression by aliens. It's a strange mix that surprisingly works so well, but the execution isn't as formidable as the premise makes one hope. Mostly the screenplay lacks the ability to pack the viewer, it's moderately flawed. With a runtime of solely one and a half hours, the film wastes the first sixty minutes with building up a mystery that was obviously understood within the first fifteen minutes. It sound ridiculous, but it's almost literally half of the film filled with Roddy Piper staring around in disbelief and showing off his muscular physique. Most of the runtime was extremely slow and verbose and didn't bring forward the plot. What I thought would be the whole movie, was squished in only thirty minutes. The storytelling is painfully unbalanced and failed to find the perfect pace. Also, the tone shifts from serious to playful multiple times and this inconsistency really hurts the development of atmosphere. The score was kinda disappointing as well, it has the typical simplicity, but the same bass line thoroughly repeated didn't support the tension at all. Next to this, it was almost inevitable that The Rowdy would show some of his moves, but aside from this, he surprisingly did a decent acting job. He made his character charmingly nasty and weirdly charismatic. Additionally, he and Keith David share a genuine and sympathic chemistry, thus enabling the audience to identify with them a lot. Such a shame that we can only experience this in an extremely rushed final act. The ending nevertheless is simply badass and a satisfying conclusion to this paranoid hell ride. All in all, it's a tremendously entertaining flick that in its core makes a lot fun, but only if you can ignore the obvious flaws it has. In the end it's a fun flick with a great concept and characters, but miserable plot structure.",They Live
143,jcbutthead86,A Great and Original Sci/Fi/Action Film Classic. Carpenter does it again.,10,28 June 2012,"John Carpenter's They Live is another Carpenter classic that greatly mixes Sci/Fi,Action and Social Commentary. The film has gained a cult following over the years and it is well-deserved.They Live is the story of an out of work drifter named John Nada(Roddy Piper)who has just arrived in L.A looking for work. When he finally finds a job, he meets up with a co-worker named Frank(Keith David) who becomes Nada's friend. Frank tells Nada that there's a place called Justiceville that takes care of the homeless and unemployed. When Justiceville is raided by the police, Nada looks through the damage and finds a box of sunglasses and when Nada puts on a pair the sunglasses reveal that the rich humans are actually aliens controlling and influencing everyday life and Nada tries to warn and tell people but it's not going to be easy.One of the reasons They Live is a great film and works so well is because it's just as relevant as it was back in 1988. The themes of people becoming poor,losing their jobs and the economy going bad relates to what's going on now in our society. Carpenter always said that this was a commentary on the Reagan era in the 1980s where the rich were getting richer and the poor were growing poorer. Carpenter sets the tone for the film in the first ten minutes showing people that are homeless and losing their jobs. You'll relate to John Nada when he's trying to look for a job in the harsh and troubling economy. If you take out the Action and Science Fiction the stuff with the economy and homeless would seem like something out of the news or a realistic documentary. It's that accurate. Instead of using humans,Carpenter uses aliens as the villains who are posing as rich human beings taking over society. Carpenter gives us a dark,eerie,paranoid,apocalyptic view as if the world was falling apart and you don't know who trust and who's human. You say that Carpenter was continuing his themes of paranoia and human beings from The Thing where human beings are paranoid and afraid of the aliens and of each other which are great themes and those same themes work here as well. What I also love about the film is the Humor and satire in this film where television and advertisements have subliminal messages underneath and also mocking the rich and the consumer culture when during the 1980s most people were about getting rich,making a lot of money and living good lives,but They Live turns that idea on it's head and offers a funny and biting satire of the era. Carpenter's commentary and jab at the Reagan era is very much dead on. John Nada is another classic Carpenter Anti-Hero we can relate to because he is down to earth and a human being that keeps his head on his shoulders and keeps his cool when he starts to go after the aliens but is also tough and cool individual that doesn't messing around. They Live is a Western in disguise and John Nada like other Carpenter Antiheros is a modern day Western cowboy instead trying to survive in the Wild West is trying to survive against Aliens in a big city The Action sequences in the film are well done with great shootouts and intensity and has one of the finest,longest,greatest fight scenes in film history. The fight scene is brutal,long and funny and at times you feel like it will go on forever,it's one of the most realistic fight scenes I've ever seen because you can feel those punches and kicks almost like you're in the scene yourself. It's Five great minutes of fighting you'll never forget. Great scene. The film also has one of the greatest lines in film history and will be quoted forever thanks to Roddy Piper. A great line. For a film made on a 4 million dollar budget the special effects are outstanding and at times makes the film look like it cost 40 million. Carpenter is a master at making a low budget film look like 70 million dollar film. The ending of the film is classic and funny and is a wonderful cap off to the film and is one of the things that makes They Live a great movie.Roddy Piper is great as John Nada bringing a cool and calm feel to the role and when Piper gets into the action,Piper says great one liners and kicks ass. No wonder Roddy Piper is one of the best pro wrestlers of all time. The Underrated Keith David is wonderful as Frank,Nada's co-worker and friend,with David bringing the same intensity and depth he brings to a lot of performances. Meg Foster does a fine job as Holly,a person that Nada meets and is trying to tell her what's going on. Carpenter actors George'Buck'Flower(Drifter)and Peter Jason(Gilbert)give great performances as does Raymond St. Jacques(Street Preacher)who is great in his small role. The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant. Carpenter moves the camera slowly and giving the film a great atmosphere especially during the black and white sequences with the aliens. The action scenes by Carpenter excellent and well-done with tightness and great editing. Great job,JohnThe score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth is excellent mixing together Western,Blues and Jazz that perfectly matches the tone of the film. It's probably my favorite Carpenter score.John carpenter's They Live is to put it simply a great and one of Carpenter's best.If you love Sci/Fi,Action and Cult films I suggest you see this film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",They Live
144,x_manicure_x,Funny and based on an interesting idea,6,14 August 2021,"John Carpenter's most straightforward commentary on post-Reagan America is surprisingly a goofy action B-movie full of corny one-liners. His attack on consumerism and media brainwashing is still relevant today, to the point that this film could be considered as the Bible of conspiracy theory Facebook pages.The most memorable thing about this film is definitely the black and white world seen from Nada's sunglasses, which has a deliciously retro look reminiscent of '50s sci-fi movies or even Fritz lang's ""Metropolis"". Then there is the incredibly epic and equally silly street brawl between Nada and Frank, which represents the difficulty of making people aware of the truth that lies in front of their eyes. The first third is a little slow-paced, but once the action kicks in, it gets rather addicting, ending with a cherry on top.It's not clear how serious Carpenter was about this film, but the choice to have a wrestler represent the working class just makes me think that he probably wasn't that much.",They Live
145,ThrownMuse,Clever sci-fi film with current cultural relevance,10,14 December 2004,"An unemployed man in the 80s (of the WWF variety, complete with Mel-mullet) shows up in the big city looking for work, American Dream intact. He finds a ""Hooverville""-like (perhaps Reaganville!) community that takes him in and finds work in construction. He notices that several of the providers are ostensibly up to no good and hold meetings at the local church. He stumbles upon a secret door and finds a stash of...80s sunglasses! After the community is destroyed by the police, our baffled working-class hero pops on a pair of the glasses, which allows him see the world as it really is, and wake up out of his sleeeepy false consciousness! Was Carpenter reading up on his Marx? Maybe! Either way, this sci-fi/action flick is fantastic, cheesy, and clever. ""They Live"" was obviously influenced by the excess of the 80s, but doesn't come across as dated and actually seems very relevant to the current cultural climate in the US. There are various flaws (namely, the creepy-in-a-bad-way Meg Foster and her character), but overall this is an excellent, amusing, and entertaining film. My Rating: 9.5/10",They Live

147,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,One of my favorite Carpenter's best horror/sci-fi monster movies,10,15 November 2019,"One of Carpenter's best horror sci-fi movies and my favorites. I grew up with this movie. The 80's were the best times for movies. Movies from 80's are only collectors I love John Carpenter I love his movies ""The Fog"", ""Escape from New York"", ""The Thing"", Prince of Darkness"", ""Big Trouble in Little China"", ""Escape from L.A."" and ""Ghosts of Mars"". Yes I enjoy these movies so much and They Live with Prince of Darkness is my favorite Carpenter 80's horror movie. Roddy Piper R.I.P. his best performance in the movie ever, one of my favorite wrestlers and action stars I grew up with it. John Carpenter visually, brilant, clever directed this style of action movie.""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubblegum.""I loved Roddy Piper in Back in Action (1994) it was arguably my first movie I saw as a kid Piper's movie. Tough and Deadly (1995) was my second film I watched on VHS I rent it the movie in the video store those two are decent one Piper did. They Live was my third film I saw and Jungleground (1996) was fourth and favorite film Roddy Pipper did. It is a shame and a tragedy Roddy Piper past away in July 30, 2015. He was one of my idols he was in Walker, Texas Ranger and in one of the episodes Piper played, he inspired me not to give up and throw my high school away. I graduate even tough I was so close by giving up and quit in sophmore and not finish the class, but I finish it. Roddy was a really good not only as a wrestler to me he was a hero and a nice person.As about the movie: Come out the same year as A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood and Fright Night Part II did, they are one of my favorite horror movies of all time.Nada (Roddy Piper) a down on his luck construction worker. Discovers a pair of special sunglasses. Wearing them he is able to see the world as it really is. People being bombarded by media and goverment with messages like ""Stay Asleep"", ""No Imagination"", Submit to Authority"", Even scarier is that he is able to see that some that some usually normal looking people are in fact ugly aliens in charge of the massive campaign tp keep humans subdued.The fact is like Aliens control our planet and the world looks how it is described in this movie. Carpenter filmed this movie with color and than Black and White color. Great effects, stunts, puppetery. It has action scenes. The fantasy is great. John Carpenter made his own music which I love the music soundtrack for this movie. Carpenter made this movie the way he wanted. They don't make movie slike this anymore.The fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David was great choreographed. The fight should only last 20 seconds but Roddy Piper and Keith David fight for real, it was rehearsed for three weaks. The fight takes longer than only 20 seconds. This is the second collaboration between John Carpenter and Keith David their first movie together was ""The Thing"" I love that movie to death. Meg Foster is in it from Leviathan, Best of the Best II and many more movies. She is one hot sexy lady as Holly Thompson. I love her in this movie.They Live is one of Carpenter's best horror movie from the 80's I love the style and the action pices in it. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc collection. It is one of my favorite Carpenter and horror movies.",They Live
148,karlericsson,Maybe the bravest film ever made.,10,17 October 2001,"In this day and age, when yuppies rule the world, it is indeed a brave thing making a movie, which depicts them as alien non-humans, slaughtering man-kind when not enslaving it.The truth is, of course, that the yuppies are just lackeys, which in this film only applies to the humans joining the aliens and not to the aliens themselves.Nevertheless, what a wonderful brave film! Took a long time for Carpenter, before he recovered from this one, it appears. He still isn't back amongst the money-makers. But with this film, he has left a legacy of awe.Mankind enslaved by market-economy, brainwashed to stupidity. That's what this film is about.

152,FairlyAnonymous,Very entertaining but it is hilariously bad,6,19 March 2013,"I've come here to chew bubblegum and write reviews. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie. It is entertaining. It is fun. But we all have to honest with ourselves here and admit that this movie is hilariously bad. Everything from its minuscule budget, lack of explanations from scene to scene, and overall bad choreography makes this movie pretty bad... and yet... it pulls it off somehow.This is one of those movies that is surprising because you would expect a bad movie to be boring and not interesting but this movie IS INTERESTING AND ISN'T BORING! The concept is around a guy who finds a pair of sunglasses that allow him to see the truth that Earth is actually populated by aliens that are controlling us. This is a neat concept and throughout the movie I was constantly interested about what was going to happen next. I can see why people really like this movie because it is entertaining and you can tell that it is purposely being cheesy... but...That isn't a full excuse. Just because it is entertaining that doesn't mean it isn't bad. Troll 2 is extremely entertaining and it is still a bad movie and deserves all of the hate it gets. One of the main problems with this movie is that it is way too short. Because the movie is so short (for an action film) it seems like a lot of scenes were rushed so there aren't a lot of explanations or any real character development. The action sequences are okay, though a couple of shootouts were cool. To me I thought it was just annoying how quickly the plot progressed because if it were fleshed out a bit more I think it could've been a much better movie. Let's not forget that the special effects are pretty merp and the aliens only placed one satellite dish apparently to cover their appearance.Overall ""They Live"" is an entertaining action movie. It is campy, has some nice one liners, low budget, and is overall enjoyable. I would suggest watching it and there isn't anything really inappropriate in it until the last 15 seconds of the movie. Go and watch it!",They Live
153,harrylosborne,Fun of the alien kind,6,4 April 2021,"John Carpenter built his reputation on the horror icons of the 70s and 80s: ""Halloween"", ""The Thing"" and ""The Fog"" are all his works, names now synonymous with the golden age of Hollywood slashers and the conception of brilliantly gory visual effects.""They Live"" is a slightly different beast, concerned less with visuals and more with the story. It's a shame that the acting is so horrendous and absurd that it doomed this movie to the B-list, because otherwise I really enjoyed this refreshingly well-executed tale.""They Live"" revolves around a special pair of sunglasses and a curious protagonist, messily played by former wrestler Roddy Piper. His strongest asset is his mullet; his weakest is his acting talent. Keith David isn't bad (a long-time collaborator of Carpenter's), but otherwise, the acting leaves a lot to be desired.Elsewhere, I actually loved this film's art design, a great mix of dystopian and menacing, all under the veil of a normal society. The 80s aesthetic is utilised by making the alien presence minimal but starkly contrasting, doing a damn sight better than nearly every other production of that era.Furthermore, 'their' willingness to blend in is a great mixture of amusing and potentially terrifying. It's infrequent that extraterrestrial films have a 'fun' element to them, so this should be appreciated,""They Live"" is a film that should be enjoyed light-heartedly, ignoring sci-fi stereotypes and forging its own, slightly askew, path. Some people might even enjoy the over-the-top acting, but otherwise, you're just getting a solid alien flick.",They Live
154,monkeysgalore,They Live is a Documentary,10,15 November 2018,"They Live is an excellent sci-fi action thriller film, and it still holds up today, as an action flick and as a culturally significant commentary on consumerism in society. Even though many consider this to be a horror film, I hesitate to categorize it as a horror film, as it's not exactly scary, and it's really more action science fiction than anything else. I absolutely love this movie, and it is never given enough credit. This film has garnered a worthy cult following, and rightfully so. As Roddy Piper said, ""They Live is a documentary"".You probably already know the plot, but it follows a drifter, John Nada (Roddy Piper), as he walks into town looking for work. He gets a job at a construction site, and befriends Frank Armitage (Keith David), another worker, and he takes Nada back to the community home for the homeless that he lives in. Over time, Nada notice some strange things,and eventually becomes aware of a sinister conspiracy, and takes matters into his own hands to put a stop to it.The film's plot is already pretty interesting, and John Carpenter is at the top of his game here, both directing, and scripting, and I was especially excited to see this after seeing ""Big Trouble in Little China"", which I thoroughly loved. The pacing is excellent, and the story is well-told, and I never lost interest in what was going on. I cared about what happened to the characters, and I was engaged in the story all the way up until the very end.Carpenter creates a bleak, engaging, often dark and gritty world, where poverty reigns among the lower-class, and the rich and affluent lead oblivious lives. Two very different worlds are shown, one of decay and hopelessness, and the other of money, power, and greed, and that, ultimately, is what the film is about; greed. The poor are shown to be the only ones who truly know what's going on, and they are not given a voice. Rather, they're stopped at every turn from sharing what they know with the world. The character of John Nada is a likable underdog, and all-round American tough guy. As soon as he realizes what's going on, he acts in one of the most rational moments in movie history; he grabs the nearest weapon and goes to town on the bad guys. Carpenter is an expert at satirizing, or at the very least, exaggerating, especially when it comes to action hero stereotypes. We already see much of this with Kurt Russell's character in the aforementioned ""Big Trouble in Little China"" here, but Carpenter establishes an even more capable, memorable action hero here that the viewer can root for. The gritty, bleak vibe is maintained right down to the very end, and Roddy Piper's positive, extreme, ready-for-action character fits perfectly into the story and becomes the hero that the world needs.The action, which I personally liked has been criticized by some, as cheap and not very well-made, but I found it to be hard-hitting, high-octane, and very enjoyable. A criticism of the film in general is that it's low-budget, cheesy, and overall of the 'B-movie' variety, but none of these facts, which may be true, stop it from telling a unique story. I personally found the action to be great, such as the bank shootout, the legendary alley fight scene, and the final shootout. The alley fight scene is honestly amazing; 5+ minutes of two guys beating the crap out of each other. It's actually one of my personal favorite fight scenes ever, it's just so brutal and over-the-top, it has to be seen to be believed. Just when you think it's about to end, it continues.Everybody's performances were good, especially Roddy Piper's, who is just fun to watch, as he, like most wrestlers, is larger-than-life. Keith David surprised me, and I didn't learn exactly how many movies he was in until after I saw this film, but I look for him now.Overall, an awesome movie, with plenty of action, one-liners, and thrills, as well as a scathing indictment of society in the 80s, which is still relevant today. 10/10, highly recommend it.",They Live
155,kingofdanerds,This film is just awesome,9,25 September 2020,"They Live is a 1988 sci fi/ horror/ and even action film that was directed by the amazing John Carpenter who also wrote the screenplay and composed the music for this film. The film was based off of a 1963 short story called ""Eight O'Clock in the Morning"". The film notably stars 80s wrestler Roddy Piper (of whom I know nothing about for the fact is is that I didn't grow up during the time when wrestling was a big deal). The film had a budget of $3 million and made back $13 million in box office. The film gained positive reviews and has even gained a cult following since its release.We meet our main character named Nada (or George Nada) who is a drifter and looking for work and a place to stay. He finds work at a construction site that sits across from a church. Nada becomes curious and sneaks in the church and discovers some weird things about the government and all of that. Nada finds a pair of sunglasses and when he puts them on, he sees subliminal messages and that some of the humans are actually aliens in disguise and that they have complete control over the whole government and even world. It is up to Nada and a group of people to fight against these aliens.This is one of those films where I have seen pictures and little clips of and I am like ""I need to watch this film"". The wait was worth it. Unlike Escape from New York (which underperfomed in my opinion), this film exceeded expectations. I know that there were some negative reviews of this film with a few criticisms and all that but I honestly do not see what it is all about. Sure, Roddy Piper might not be the best actor when it comes to line delivery (and it gets a little weird), but come on, he is a wrestler first. I don't expect anything better. But don't get me wrong, he is a major badass and his physicality works here as well. I love it! The other actors do an OK job for the most part and the characters are not bad either but obviously Roddy Piper steals the show here. There is one character that in my opinion did not work and that would be Meg Foster's character Holly. To me, she was somewhat pointless and where she could have worked (and there are some moments where it appears she can), she is forgotten and then brought back into the film and the same thing happens. I love the themes and symbolism here in this film that is somewhat relevant now (in 2020). I love how the glasses are used to see what the world is truly like and it is very clever. The social commentary is really good here (and strange enough is that it was critcized). There are some truly iconic scenes in this film including the sunglasses scene, a certain utterance of a line, and a nearly 6 minute long punchng fight which is a great fight in terms of choreography where all of the punches and hits are real. Is it drawn out? A little, but every punch hurt me as a viewer. So it must have been doing something right. The action elements in this film are pretty cool and badass. Lastly, the soundtrack is pretty cool as well. I love the theme and all of the other tracks as well.They Live is an amazing film of John Carpenter's. It is a really awesome film only brought down by Meg Foster's character here (and that makes me a little sad because without her character being pointless, this film would have been perfect.) I am so glad that I have watched this film because it was a treat to watch.",They Live

Whilst Carpenter's more 'straight' horror movies are, on the whole, excellent, this is the one that gets my pulse rate soaring. Blending horror and sci-fi with a rather healthy dose of utter paranoia, this is one of those films that has a 'Holy Christ' moment in it, which I won't elaborate on here for fear of spoiling. Seriously folks, this is one of those Sixth Sense scenes that just completely blind-sides you. 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper is more than proficient in the lead role, a role apparently written with Kurt Russell in mind, and you can tell.

The main characters journey is to wake everyone up from said oblivious state however some people are happy to just go with the flow and aren't so keen on waking up.The film is happy to cheapen itself with overlong fight sequences and cheesy music.One particular fight scene in an alley between WWE star Roddy Piper and Keith David looks like one of Pipers wrestling sequences and his inclusion in the film points to this scene.So in summary They Live is hardly a masterpiece but has a lot to mull over quietly bubbling under its surface. 6/10,They Live

I suppose that any collectivism vs. individualism movie—from Invasion of the Body Snatchers to 1984 or The Matrix —manifests similar qualities. The sad thing is that in reality, when collectivism rules, we have only (defective) humans to blame. Our collectivist rulers are aliens only symbolically; though I would not be surprised if the defect that afflicts them were biological and those who are addicted to power may someday be shown to have been a distinct subspecies of homo sapien.In the movies, for dramatic impact no doubt, the writers seem to need to posit alien creatures at some location in the ""collectivist-ruler"" political metaphor.

164,chvylvr80,One of Carpenter's better efforts,6,14 January 2004,"Movies like They Live aren't made much anymore. Cheap and corny though it may be, They Live represents a dying breed. Good B-movie sci-fi. Back when John Carpenter was making good movies instead of slowly digging his own grave, They Live showed the viewer a filmmaker that always had a clear vision of what he was doing. They Live isn't meant to be taken too seriously on the surface. The biting social commentary that reveals itself when our heroes put on their special sunglasses is the real scary part of the movie, the alien masks don't shock unless you put yourself in Roddy Piper's shoes.
By far the best and most famous part of the film (besides the line ""I am here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum."") is the seemingly endless fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David. Long, brutal, and started for the stupidest reason, this scene is the blueprint for the cripple fight between Jimmy and Timmy in South Park.Bottom Line: They Live isn't the greatest movie ever or anything but it's worth checking out if you like John Carpenter or sci-fi. Rent before you buy.",They Live
165,metalrage666,This is how things really are!,8,4 November 2015,"I love this movie. I first saw this in the very early 90's, hired on VHS and I've loved this ever since. People always laughed at me when I said that life sucks because of aliens, and with They Live, I'm even more convinced.""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper - God rest his soul, plays a drifter who comes to town looking for work. He makes friends with Keith David who takes him to a shanty town for a meal and a place to stay. Piper then notices some odd activity along with late night choir singing at a nearby church and on investigating he finds boxes of cheap looking sunglasses, with the ""choir"" being nothing more than a speaker set-up. The next day he puts on the glasses and notices that everything turns black and white with all visible text revealing hidden messages. It seems that all signs, billboards, magazines and even cash has hidden messages which are only revealed through the sunglasses. The messages are all simple authoritarian commands such as ""obey"" ""marry and reproduce"" ""this is your god"" - referring to money, and so forth. All of this reaches the human mind subliminally in an effort to keep us all subdued and docile, while the aliens take up varying positions of power and control. So while our eyes see a billboard advertising a holiday our brains are actually being told to conform.Also revealed are the appearance of the aliens living amongst us. Basically most of those in positions of authority or those who are rich are all aliens. They're ugly, with mottled skin, big glassy eyes, no lips and a face full of ugly teeth. When Piper hilariously confronts some of these aliens in a supermarket they realise that ""they have one that can see"", and set about describing his appearance into their Dick Tracy style watches. He then kills two police officers, who are also aliens, and uses their guns to shoot up a nearby bank.With Piper now branded a wanted criminal he tracks down his friend and we're then given one of the most memorable fight sequences ever. After beating each other to a pulp and then finally managing to convince his friend to put on the sunglasses to see the real world for himself, they end up becoming part of a small band of resistance fighters who have been struggling to locate the source of the alien transmissions that have blocking their true identities to the rest of humanity.After a few setbacks and the human resistance almost completely wiped out, we find that some humans are persuaded to join the alien ranks by ratting out anyone who opposes them in lieu of huge bank accounts and a cushy lifestyle. Eventually the transmission device is destroyed and aliens identities suddenly appear on TV, casually sitting among us in bars, or even while enjoying human prostitutes. While They Live doesn't have great acting or memorable special effects, it works because it's an example of how a simple idea, with minimal budget can still gain a cult following and speak to a multitude of people. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to being constantly overlooked for promotion, or never winning the lottery, never being able to catch a break or always managing to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And quite frankly if you're someone who's never experienced any of this, obviously you're an alien. There's just too many things in this movie that make a truckload of sense and have all the pieces of life's puzzle suddenly fall into place. Luckily this movie can be found almost anywhere like a cheap pair of sunglasses, so grab a copy, watch it several times and believe that ""they live"".",They Live
166,cosmorados,Don't remake that! Remake this!,7,12 July 2008,"Nada is on the scrapheap in a decade of disposable income and disposable people. The world is one that gives all its resources to those that have and increasingly little to those who don't. Something is wrong with the world but no-one can figure out quite what. That is until Nada discovers a pair of sunglasses that don't just darken the view but remove all the colour from the world. It's only when he wears these that he sees the subliminal messages that order to people to obey authority, consume as much as possible, reproduce and generally maintain the status quo. The sunglasses also reveal another secret that is all the more terrifying about the world that I'm not going to go into here.This had the potential to be the best John Carpenter film to date, however the lack of Kurt Russell in the lead role is a clear problem with Roddy Piper being an inadequate replacement for Kurt Russell. The script is pretty darn good and the idea a solid one that is well executed.The really sad thing about both this and ""Dark City"" for me is that both films really make one question the nature of the world we inhabit and invite us, the viewer, to ask questions about the world that also surrounds us, however both of these films, while good, failed at the box office, almost as if the audience where not ready to yet undertake such fundamental questions over existence. It was only when the Matrix was made that such films have started to become more acceptable to a mass audience, although the main thing to be taken from ""The Matrix"" being an overuse of wire martial arts where is is not needed.Not the best John Carpenter film he ever did, but with talk of a remake of ""The Thing"" in the pipeline I wish they would remake this one and allow it to be put together to its best potential.Still all right though.7 out of 10",They Live
167,Mikew3001,A witty look at Reagan's and Bush's America,8,5 June 2002,"Following the rather traditional ""devil reborn"" pattern of his 1987 production ""Princes of Darkness"", horror director John Carpenter made ""They Live"" one year later and focused on a paranoia of Ronald Reagan's and George Bush's U.S.A. of the 1980's. Aliens are ruling the world and have made the people to modern slaves, following the directives of consumption, obedience, power, corruption and lies.Modern media, advertising, pop culture, politics and television are the mask of this invisible alien invasion, and it's the turn of wrestler Roddy Piper to find a pair of sunglasses(!) that reveal the true face of the rotten society - and of course it's the turn of his enormous muscles to start the fight against the invaders...Carpenter takes the typical paranoia plots of 1950's science fiction movies like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""The Thing"" (of which he already did a remake in 1982) to show the true face of society via a science fiction/horror movie. But instead of reviving the anti-communist and anti-liberal ideas of the fifties he's taking a rather left-winged and Reagan-opposed view on society - and one with much more humor than in the cold war area.""They Live"" really works and has earned positive reviews even by critics who are not into the horror/sf genre. The story is fun to watch, and there are some twists, action, thrills and nice special effects. The only mistake is the choice of stupid-looking Roddy Piper for the hero - a real actor with less muscles and more expressions in his face would have been a far better choice for this social fiction picture. Anyway, watch out for the invisible enemies in the sky - or for the next VHS or DVD copy of this movie!",They Live
168,spacemonkey_fg,"Good social commentary, but slow pacing",4,15 September 2005,"Title: They Live (1988) Director: John Carpenter Cast: Rody Piper, Keith David, Meg Foster Review: John Carpenter is hailed as a horror master anywhere you go, and why not he has made such incredible contributions to the genre that heck, there's no way that he could NOT be considered amongst one of the greats. But among those great ones there's a few crappy ones and a few so-so ones. They Live is one of the so-so ones, in my opinion.The story is about a drifter named NADA (that means nothing in Spanish by the way) and the guy is looking for a job trying to make his way in life. So when he ends up in a shelter he discovers that there is actually a whole rebel force teaming up to go up against these aliens that are trying to take over our world. Here comes Roddy Piper and David Keith ready to take them on and kick their collective asses.This movie has a few things going for it and a few bad things going for it. Ill start by the good stuff. First off, the biggest attraction for me with this movie is the story. There's aliens that are trying to take over the world while disguising themselves as human beings is a great story. I love how they represent the rich and oppressive side of humanity. How the rich and powerful are trying to keep the poor poor and ignorant. Only in this movie they are aliens trying to manipulate us via the TV set and subliminal messages spread out all over the media. Great stuff. Immediately anyone who has felt the oppression and constant hammering of the media and the never ending bombardment of TV commercials will instantly identify with this story. So thats what grabbed me right away.What didn't grab me right away was the slow pacing of the film. Right from the get go when you hear the movies soundtrack which consists of a slow as hell bass line you know you are in for a slow flick. And it never really picks up, its just constantly slow. There was never an effort to liven things up, its all very ho hum. Even the ""action"" sequences had nothing special about em...and yeah, I'm talking about that fight sequence between Piper and Keith. I really didn't find it all that special.Another thing that didn't really do it for me were the stupid decisions that the characters kept on making over and over again. Walk around broad daylight with a shot gun in hand? Check. Walk into a bank with a shotgun in hand and start shooting at everybody? Check. Hows about letting the aliens know that you can see their true appearance? OK, lets do that! There's more things they do like that, but it just drove me nuts after a while. And ultimately made me hate the main characters....or feel sorry for their high level of stupidity.Then there's the aliens themselves. First off, the rebels say that the aliens are breeding us to use us as slaves? And they want to take over the world, but we never really see any of this happening, in fact the aliens seem pretty harmless to me, save for the fact that they are not from this planet, they really aren't a threat! For the longest time I kept asking myself, why are these aliens being portrayed as evil? What exactly are they doing thats so damn bad for humanity, and an answer to that question never really showed up. So suddenly I felt like the humans were really just being a bunch of racists. Shooting aliens just cause they ain't humans.The look of the aliens didn't really bother me because I think its kind of cool in a low budget sort of way. I mean lets face it, they obviously didn't have much moola if the aliens ended up looking like that. When they talk it looks so fake! You can tell its just a cheap ass mask over the actors face. Anyhows, not a big problem for me, but I'm sure a lot of people will hate it.And finally, I really gotta say that watching this flick I got the same feeling I got when I watched Jhon Carpenters Ghost of Mars and Prince of Darkness. I just really felt that Carpenter got really lazy while making this flick. You can tell certain story elements and script elements could have been developed further and better, you can tell certain scenes could have been directed better had they been planed more elaborately. I don't know the whole film just films like a rushed job, specially towards the ending.But don't get me wrong, I don't hate this movie, I like its themes and what its trying to say. I get the message fo the film and all. It was about chicks right? Just kidding. But really, what rubbed me the wrong way was the sloppy execution. Heres to Carpenters golden days the good old days, the days of Chinese ghost stories, ghost pirates and spider like alien heads. Those days seem to be gone forever.Rating: 21/2 out of 5",They Live
169,Lucabrasisleeps,Funny and brilliant movie,9,20 January 2015,"John carpenter has always switched between genres and he has proved it in most of the genres. Here he tackles the sci fi genre with lots of social commentary and comedy. What makes this movie special are the 80s touches which make it far more interesting than any arty boring movie about the evils of consumerism. The main character is a drifter who is looking for work and he gets some temporary work where Frank works. As they say, the idle mind is a devil's workshop. Soon he is fascinated by the underground group who seems to know all the answers with regard to alien control of the world . Carpenter relates this concept to some anti-capitalist message about the rich either being part of the alien species or making some deals with the species. The rest of the story deals with the fight of this underground group against the elite aliens. Ever since I discovered the internet, I have become aware of these conspiracy theorists and their grand theories about the elite. This movie reminded me of that, so I was slightly annoyed. But the movie is so much fun, you don't really care that much. That's the great thing about 80s movies, they don't try to be pretentious and bore you to death. This is all about rowdy roddy piper, gun fights, a long pointless fight (it is only around 5 minutes but it felt longer) and a woman with creepy eyes. Oh and what a fight! This is one of the highlights of the movie. It was like watching a real wrestling match. I guess maybe Keith David was given some sort of training briefly before getting into this. It was a little hilarious because they were beating each other to death for no reason almost. This is a remarkable 80s moment in my opinion. The lines are so funny! Apart from the obvious choices (bubble gum line), there are so many underrated lines which I loved so much. For a guy who doesn't have much experience in acting, his dialogue delivery is actually pretty awesome! And Keith David is also pretty good in this one. I have never seen Meg foster in any movie and frankly she scares me with her creepy eyes.The ending is a nice touch to complete this fun film in a funny way. I loved it 9/10",They Live
170,nikitalinivenko,Maybe all the fans should put on the glasses first,1,17 December 2019,"Has anyone ever noticed that the worse a movie is, the more ardent the cult following? They Live is not a good movie. Half a movie is the message - the other half is the movie itself. Just because it has a topical message, doesn't make the movie well-executed. Most Spike Lee joints have an urgent message, that does not mean most Spike Lee movies are good. They Live is literally just Invasion of the Body Snatchers (dastardly aliens look like us and blend in with society to propagate conformity) only instead of an allegory for Commies, this time it's an allegory for Reagenites. This is like the edgiest movie ever...when you're 13. A cheesy alley fight that manages to be boring with its bad WWE theatrics and seemingly goes on forever and refuses to end. Corny one-liners that sound like they were said by a middle-schooler the more you think about it. And of course our newly (I really, really can't stand this phrase) ""woke"" heroes rally to take down the man, man! Also, when they teleport to Alien HQ, I'm really confused about the layout - it seems they're in a station overlooking earth with aliens being teleported down there, but when they reach the roof (and of course have the typical cliche rooftop stand-off and a helicopter hovers up) they're clearly on Earth?

172,joshi_3592,"One of Carpenter best movies! It's simple, funny, and serious at the same time.",10,17 September 2009,"This movie honestly became one of my favourite movies before it was even over. It's a perfect example on how great a film can get on a tight budget. Like most Carpenter films it has a bit of a ""horror"" feel to it, this time with more of an ""what if were all controlled by aliens"" kind of idea. I love it it's simple, funny, and serious at the same time. I personally think this should be one of John Carpenter's five best movies.I'll try not to spoil to much, so I'll only mention the main character. The movie is basically about a drifter called Nada played by Roddy Piper. he basically just walks around trying to get a job, when he sees something mystical going on around a church in a very poor neighbourhood. he finds a workshop in the building which is making sunglasses (another great example of the movies simplicity). After the whole area gets raided by a police force he manages to hid a box of sunglasses. he decides to take one for himself and use them. But when he puts them on, he start seeing things that other cant. Billboards changes into messages like: obey, consume, reproduce. And certain people aren't human at all. It's soon apparent that the world is controlled by subliminal messages broad-casted from some type of aliens. Now I wont spoil any more so I'll just stop here.I advise all Sci-Fi and Carpenter fans to see this film. It's an original idea, with clever message, but it doesn't weigh down the movie, but is brought forward in a very funny and exiting way. i give this movie a 10/10.",They Live
173,Minus_The_Beer,Another Shade of Carpenter,9,27 May 2011,"After successfully haunting audiences with stone-cold boogeymen and sub-zero aliens, director John Carpenter decided to take a new direction with 1988's ""They Live."" Inspired (or perhaps disgusted) by the failing economy and growing commercialism of the times, Carpenter used greed and control as the antagonist in the film, creating an all-new and all-too-real villain. Sure, there's also an alien sub-plot at hand, but what sets ""They Live"" apart is its unique blend of cynicism and dark comedy which has ensured the film's status as a quotable cult-classic that is surprisingly just as relevant today as it was some twenty odd years ago when Carpenter first put pen to paper.Pro-wrestler Roddy Piper stars as Nada, a peaceful (and surprisingly well-kept) drifter (read: hobo) who stumbles into Los Angeles in search of his piece of the American Dream. He gets more than he bargained for when he stumbles upon a pair of sunglasses that reveal the world for what it is. It turns out aliens are using subliminal messages to manipulate and control the masses. Like many conspiracy theorists, Nada struggles with credibility, eventually converting a co-worker (Keith David) and a beautiful but feisty woman (Meg Foster) to his cause.Surprisingly, Piper certainly has the charisma to tackle the film, more-so than the average wrestler turned actor, as a matter of fact. In fact, even though somebody like Kurt Russell could just as easily stepped into the role and made it work, Piper turns out to be an excellent and engaging action hero who keeps things fun and light, but never loses human touch. You'll root for him and his one-liners as well as chuckle and cheer when he engages in a lengthy back-alley brawl with his co-star (one for the books and certainly worth checking out the film just to see). It's a shame his career went south in the following decade to make room for the likes of Hulk Hogan (?!) and The Rock (ugh).As for Carpenter, he delivers in classic form. Despite the cynicism at hand, he keeps the film fun and fast-paced. Like his best films, it swells to its conclusion, creating a roller-coaster ride effect that few directors now how to. Sure, there are flaws in the film if you look close enough (the narrative takes a backseat to over-the-top action bits and humorous chunks of dialog) but while it entertains it also makes you think a little, which is the genius of Carpenter. In the end, ""They Live"" is worth re-living again and again and you don't need special glasses to see that little nugget of truth.",They Live
174,MetalGeek,"""I Wear My Sunglasses At Night...""",6,14 June 2010,"How can you not love this movie? Former pro wrestler ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper is kicking ass because he's all out of bubble gum. What more do you need? But seriously folks, ""They Live"" is a mostly cool little B-Movie from famed director John Carpenter but it suffers from a bit of schizophrenia. Carpenter seems to want ""They Live"" to be both a balls-out action movie and a ""message movie"" all rolled into one film, and though he tries hard to envelop the viewer in creeping paranoia, by the end he's been more successful at the ass-kicking part.Piper stars as ""Nada,"" a mulleted drifter in a flannel shirt who wanders into L.A. looking for construction work. He takes up residence at a homeless shanty town outside a church where strange goings on seem to happen in the dead of night. One day the police show up, raid the church, and bulldoze the homeless encampment. Piper enters the now-abandoned church and finds a stash of special sunglasses. When he puts one of them on, his formerly Technicolor world is now a stark black and white, and he can see the subliminal messages hidden under every advertisement, on all TV broadcasts, and on every newspaper and magazine cover. Things like ""OBEY,"" ""STAY ASLEEP,"" ""NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT,"" ""THIS IS YOUR GOD"" (on a dollar bill). Even more shocking is that through the glasses, some of the ""people"" he sees aren't really ""people,"" they're bug-eyed, skull faced alien beings. It quickly becomes apparent that these alien beings have taken the places of the rich, the elite and the powerful, while regular Earthlings like Nada have been relegated to the bottom of the food chain. So what's a red blooded American to do when his eyes have been opened to the truth? Pick up a shotgun and start blasting away at every skull face he sees, of course! Now a wanted man after a shootout with police, Nada succeeds in turning a fellow construction worker (Keith David) to his point of view thanks to the special sunglasses (the epic length fight scene between them that leads to David's conversion is already legend and needs no further discussion here), and our heroes hook up with an anti-alien resistance movement determined to find the enemy's broadcast signal, destroy it, and reveal the impostors to the world. I will leave it up to the viewer to find out for themselves if they're successful.As with most Carpenter films, there's a healthy dose of goofy humor underneath the skin of ""They Live."" The scene when Piper first dons the magic glasses and sees what's hiding underneath everything is both creepy and hilarious at the same time. The film does have some pacing problems; it takes seemingly forever for the action to kick into gear but once it does ""They Live"" is a white knuckle ride to the very end, packed with shootouts, fist fights, and one-liners aplenty. Piper may not be much of an actor, but he doesn't really need to be in a film like this, and he's given suitable backup in David.Intended as a satire of 1980s materialism and consumption, ""They Live"" pretty much went over the heads of most viewers when it was current, but nowadays it holds up as a pretty decent gouging of everything that was wrong with that decade. Even scarier is that given the current world economic situation, the story could even take place today. Small wonder, then, that a remake of ""They Live"" is reportedly in the works. I hope they leave in the line about the bubble gum.",They Live
175,DanLives1980,Iconic Cult Sci-Fi,8,30 March 2015,"Welcome to one of the most iconic modern sci-fi action movies made. A film that has gone on to inspire the work of artist Sheppard Fairey amongst an endless list of eternally grateful filmmakers. Its director, the legendary and criminally understated John Carpenter, absolutely hated it, seeing as it was the movie that burned him out, labelled him a commercial failure and saw him retreat prematurely into semi-retirement! One of the few original movies of the 20th Century that is highly coveted as a bible of hidden truths in a world of elitism, conspiracy and the fate of man's freedom where capitalism and corporate rule are destroying the world, I don't think it was ever meant to be so clever, so deep or foreboding, but what would otherwise be an average '80s action movie is instead a shout against the alienation and segregation of the middle and lower classes, thanks to the ignorance of the super wealthy.Starring WWE superstar Rowdy Roddy Piper in a fascinating and often intense lead role as drifter John Nada, our relenting and reluctant hero stumbles upon a Los Angeles where the unemployed and homeless are being driven out as alien beings in disguise sit at the top of the economic hierarchy, acclimatising the globe to their own preference.Upon witnessing the carnage first hand, and then discovering a way he can separate the aliens from humans, Nada goes on the rampage, catching the attention of the underground resistance who've been planning a way to expose the alien threat for some time. Nada and his new friends have one chance to make it right or die as the armies of the enemy close in to exterminate them all.As usual with any '80s Carpenter movie, you might not know his family of go-to character actors (Peter Jason, Keith David, George ""Buck"" Flower etc.), but they are all naturals and they really add to the atmosphere. Keith David had always been a great co-star and put even more into his work alongside Rowdy than even with Kurt Russell in 'The Thing.' The fight they have in the alleyway is painful to watch. You'll never see a street fight like it ever again.In terms of cinematography, it's the staple Carpenter look widescreen film format, always perfectly shot and a pleasure to watch. In terms of soundtrack, it's Carpenter's least effective, but with that slow-beating western style every time Nada's on screen and counting his woes, it serves the character and the story, so it's not distracting.As for action, Arnie and Stallone must have blushed for sure and Carpenter always having been ahead of his time gave a kind of arcade game first person shooter feel to some of the shootouts, which is really interesting considering he's retired from the business to sit and play X-Box all day every day.Other cons; it has some boring quiet moments that don't work as well as they could have, and the strain on Carpenter's creative muscle does show at times through some clunky scenes and empty dialogue. There lacks a little chemistry between Rowdy and leading lady Meg Foster, though I think we're supposed to notice that for a reason.On a whole, it's like the sci-fi action movie Walter Hill never made. Imagine that Hill and Schwarzenegger made this instead of 'Red Heat' because you could watch them back to back on a Saturday night and have the time of your life without a doubt.Not perfect but so horribly underrated. I hope Carpenter now realises how 'They Live' had to wait a couple decades to be really appreciated. Because for those of us who understand the message, it's really true: ""They Live, We Sleep!""",They Live
176,K-Slicer,Decent Effort,8,3 November 2002,"This is a great movie with a kind of Orwellian world view to it.  It turns out that ""Big Brother"" is really from another planet.  Roddy Piper does well as the nameless drifter trying to stop the evil aliens that rule our planet. The plot seems trivial but the ending really is not.  ""They Live"" probably contains the best desperation fist fight that was ever captured on film.  By no means is ""The Matrix"", ""Dark City"", ""Donnie Darko"", or even The ""Alien"" Four-pack but this is a worthy addition to the sci-fi community.

177,rdvljunk,forgotten Hollywood classic,4,7 November 2013,"Philosopher Slavoy Zizek calls this movie a forgotten Hollywood classic. I just love sarcasm. Now I admit that the basic plot, people are kept dumb by the ruling class (in this case infiltrated aliens (of really bad design, but OK, this is the 80's)) is interesting and an indictment against society. The fight between the two hero's to make John's friend wear the sunglasses so he can see the truth is metaphoric for the struggle (fight) to become free (according Zizek violence is required to become free). But the plot is completely ruined by bad acting, ridiculous fight scenes (two guards jump out a corridor blazing their guns missing everything and the hero's kill them with a single shot, the police raids the church and take everything but fail to locate the simply hidden boxes with sunglasses, the hero's fall into the hidden underground base of the aliens, all dirty, and make it to a black-tie conference of the aliens and collaborators; and get a tour by one of the participants that explains everything and are brought to the main control center.

178,jamhorner,Actually Pretty Good!,8,18 July 2007,"The concept of this movie was great. The sunglasses reveal the truth about aliens living in the world and shows what the world really looks like, almost like The Matrix, but for this time, it was a great achievement in ""fantasy world"" concepts. The editing was amazing in contrasting the difference between what we see and what a person with the sunglasses see, and it really showed what a talented editor can do with juxtaposition. In the story, there is a group of people that are conspiring to stop the invasion of the aliens. What I think that makes this movie work so effectively is the whole prelude to the alien invasion and the whole apocalyptic sense. It had the great special effects, evidenced by the way the aliens looked and the ""teleportation"" device that was under the city.It's hard to explain why I love the feel of this movie but it has something to do with the decade that it was made in. It's not the special effects or the plot structure; it's almost as if it's one of the best alien invasion movies that I've seen from this decade. It's hard to pin point what I like about this movie, but I can say that it was a great thrill ride with a lot of great action and violence with great performances to back it up. For me it was a thrill ride that I would recommend to anybody who loves alien movies or even John Carpenter movies. You'll hopefully know what I'm talking about when you see it.",They Live
179,mitchell5954,A Bit Underwhelming For A Carpenter Film!,5,1 November 2013,"They Live, sadly, is one of my least favorite John Carpenter films. It is a shame because, like with most of his films, They Live has a great premise. The problem is that most of the characters, save one, I do not care for. The main character especially got on my nerves half way through the film. The way it ends is a bit anti-climactic as well.The film stars a drifter named Nada, played by Roddy Piper. He comes to this out-of-the-way workplace looking for a job. There he meets a man named Frank, played by Keith David. Nada then comes across a group of mysterious people lurking around with boxes filled with sunglasses. After a riot breaks out he puts on the one pair of the sunglasses, and through them he sees an entirely different world. He comes to realize that aliens have enslaved humanity without them even realizing it. They can only be seen in their true form with the sunglasses. Nada then tries to get Frank on his side but he thinks he is crazy at first. However, Frank eventually joins up with him and, together with a group of resistance fighters, they must free the world.There are many good things about the film. The premise is interesting. The makeup effects for the aliens themselves look fine. I also like Keith David in the film. He is a great actor and has a great voice. I like that over the years he has grown in popularity a bit.However, the rest of the cast I do not care for. I liked the main character, Nada, in the beginning, but later on he kind of annoyed me. Roddy Piper does a so-so job acting wise. He was not bad but he was not that good either. Once he finds out about the aliens and their takeover he does the dumbest thing ever. He breaks into a bank armed and shoots all the aliens disguised as humans painting as a crazy maniac, and now everyone is after him. I understand that he is in shock, but he should have handled everything with more of a cool head. When he confronts Frank again and Frank thinks he is crazy I do not blame him. If Nada had handled everything with a cool head he could have made everything easier on himself.The other characters are not even worth mentioning. The effects are not bad, but they are pretty sub-par. They are nothing compared to the effects in The Thing or Starman. While the makeup effects were good, I do not care for the design of the aliens. The ending was a bit anti-climactic too.Overall, They Live is not bad. I think that, if you are a fan of John Carpenter's other films, then this is worth at least one viewing. However, compared to most of his other work, I felt that this was sub-par.",They Live
180,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: They live,8,24 August 2015,"Now this one's a real screamer. Roddy Piper stars as a good-natured but not very bright construction worker, who pretty much spends his day chewing bubble-gum and kicking ass. He discovers a pair of sunglasses that give him the ability to separate normal humans from aliens that have taken over earth. In the fashion of every conspiracy theorist's dream, these aliens brainwash humans through subliminal advertising (which isn't too different today). Like most Carpenter's movies, it's fun artistic and, most importantly, doesn't take itself too seriously. Capenter's camera-work in They Live is remarkable for the very fact that it is unremarkable – he chooses to let his cameras to be simply used as reverence points and allows the two leads, Roddy Piper and Keith David, to carry the movie, accompanied by a comic a stoner- like score. They Live, whist funny, is culturally relevant – it highlight's the struggles of the working man who often is unable to stand out and make a change for fear of his job, family, home etc. – even if it mean aliens have taken over the world. Keith David's character represents this, whilst the drifter Piper is able to make a difference because he has no family or home to lose. The movie smartly taps into the suspicion that most of us are being taken advantage of by the elite of America, the rich, the cooperation owners etc. The fear of the illuminati. The fear of Zionism .It could be seen as the alleged Jewish infiltration of Western society. Or any elite sub-society that lives off the lower classes and are free from work, poverty or persecution. It's a pretty profound theme to be found in a film as intentionally offbeat and quirky as They Live. Its movies like this that make you feel (or want to fee, perhaps?) that the director is trying to telegraph you a secret that he knows of. In fact, it's pretty suspicious that this film, which was number one at Box Office for two weeks, disappeared from theatres straight after. I guess some nameless suits weren't too pleased at its release. Only, that's the beauty of independent filmmaking – you can make what you want without a studio pulling the strings. Best Scene: It has to be the WWE style street brawl between the two leads, as Pipe tries again and again to make the ignorant David put on the glasses and open his eyes to the horror around him. A shout out to the hilarious sex ending though.",They Live
181,jcanettis,"Good Scenario Idea, Yet Mediocre Total Result",6,31 December 2003,"Carpenter's ""They Live"" is based on a clever scenario idea: Mankind is dominated by human-looking aliens, who are blended inside the social system unnoticed. The aliens occupy all the leadership positions, while they broadcast hidden subjucating messages (""obey"", ""conform to authority"", etc.) to the humans who are given only the hard-labor positions. Everything runs smoothly (for the aliens) until a construction worker is getting involved into a rebel group who has found out what's really happening and tries to revolt.Clever the idea might be, its implementation is below expectations. The characters are rather improbable and unconvincing, the plot develops and ends up in a quite naive way, and Carpenter has certainly directed some better movies than this one.All in all the film gets a 6/10 pass grade.",They Live

""They Live"" really has a nice pace and a certain balance that set it apart as a unique piece of work.  I'd say it probably resembles ""The Hidden"", in that both were sleeper hits and both have a definite quirky likability to them, a certain charm that is irresistible.

183,MrVibrating,Cheesy fun with a very clear message,6,8 November 2006,"It's easy to see what Carpenter thinks about the USA in this movie.Well, not so much about the USA, more about the politics during the time of yuppies and Reagonomics. In retrospect, it's easy to do what Bret Easton Ellis did in American Psycho; despise it and denounce it. Carpenter did that when it actually happened, which is more admirable.Politics aside, the movie has it's ups and downs. It's got a visibly low budget, the main character is played by a wrestler, there is circa 0,9 female characters in the entire movie, and the political message is plain as day.On the other hand, it's well directed, some simple things add originality without straining the budget, the make-up effects are really cool and there are some funny one-liners. Some scenes are pretty chilling as well, especially when Roddy Piper puts the glasses on for the first time.The script is a bit weak though, and it's probably the movie's biggest fault. No-one can help a small budget, but a script is free(Carpenter wrote it himself). The ending is too convenient, everything goes well. Still, maybe seeing mr. Piper cleverly figure out the big clue would have been equally bad.Even though it's not a quality movie, it's certainly worthwhile.",They Live

There's wrestlers, aliens and a plot to take over the world. My friends and I quoted this film for weeks on end with the Bubble gum and kicking @$$ line being a favourite among all. The only real complaint that I have about the film is that the aliens when finally revealed are far too human. They basically look like a skeleton with bug eyes. Not a whole lot of energy seemed to go into their design. While They Live will never be remembered as a film that redefined the way films were made, it still to this day holds a place in my heart as one of the films that just defines your youth.

Any film where shooting police is shown as a heroic act would not fly today! (even if they are really aliens.) Although Rowdy Roddy Piper is not the most gifted actor who ever lived, he is perfect as a working man who has been screwed over by a corrupt system.

As you may have gathered, I was disappointed by this film. I would have liked it more if it hadn't been as good, if that makes sense? The annoying thing is that it had potential, and then let itself down (Meg Foster's 'acting' is spectacularly wooden) by wretched delivery of dialogue and the most insultingly token boob shot I've ever seen (late on  you can't miss it).

190,CalDexter,Brilliant black comedy satire with plenty of thrills and gun drama.,10,6 November 2006,"This is one of my favourite John Carpenter movies.

He becomes embroiled in a rebellion to destroy the aliens that have corrupted mankind with huge wealth and property temptations.This has all the ingredients of John Carpenter: music score, camera-work, traditional character actors etc. etc. But They Live is an enjoyable adult comic book of machine guns and one liners and so much more...It also has a great performance by Roddy Piper as Nada and his line 'I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass....and Im all out of bubblegum!' is one of the best Hollywood lines in movie history.They Live also has the greatest fight scene up a city alley EVER, and it goes on for a staggering seven minutes! Special mention to Keith David for playing Frank who is just plain funny from start to finish, i loved it when he and Nada are rolling about the ground because of his stubborn refusal to wear the sunglasses.See They Live, its a great laugh as well as a great movie. It reminded me a little of Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers (the 70s version) intermixed with the buddy/buddy thrills of Lethal Weapon.I think i love this film so much because i think Roddy Piper is awesome as Nada.

Suppose you put on some special glasses and saw the secret subliminal messages of all those advertisements? THEN discovered that the people in office you didn't vote for are aliens, since you saw their real faces through the glasses (the action of which is conveniently unexplained)?This is the tale that the filmmakers treat with a straight face.  It's the devil-in-the-bottle theory applied to ""consumerism"", stating that advertising can CONTROL YOUR MIND.  First, if it could, you wouldn't know it, and second, if you want a serious portrayal of anticapitalist viewpoints in action (as perceived by their advocates), try the Richard Dreyfuss pic ""The Big Fix"", 1978, I think.

194,MWNiese,Popcorn Social Commentary,8,6 May 2008,"""The poor and the underclass are growing. Racial justice and human rights are non-existent. They have created a oppressive society and we are the unwitting accomplices."" So preaches the leader of an underground movement, fighting back against the burgeoning upper class of white elites taking over corporations and the government. More social allegory than horror movie, Carpenter blends social criticism with horror, action, and science fiction. An unemployed construction worker, Roddy Piper, stumbles into LA hoping to get back on track with a new job. Piper has spent his whole life following the rules and working hard, but this still hasn't been enough to enable him to provide for a minimalist existence.Piper does get his new construction job, but in the process he stumbles upon an underground group of rebels, who manufacture special sunglasses that allow ""normal humans"" to see society for what it truly is: A series of advertisements promoting conservative brainless values, based on thoughtless reproduction and heartless greed and consumption. Piper accidentally becomes a lead figure in the rebel movement attempting to expose the disgusting elitists taking advantage of the poor and destitute.Many of the social commentaries explored in this film ring true more today than when this film was released in 1988. John Carpenter is one of the most under-rated directors in modern film-making. His films are easy targets for people to rip down and unfairly criticize because he often makes films that don't appeal to mainstream audiences. Much like Craven, he does what he wants to do, and if you don't like it stay home and rent ""Independence Day"". ""They Live"" is grossly underrated and overlooked by the film community and moviegoers in general.Admittedly a bit campy at times, ""They Live"" is one of the few films in modern Hollywood that addresses the serious problem of the ever widening wealth distribution gap occurring in the US. Like Craven, Carpenter is often criticized for going too far and for disregarding what is prim, proper, and acceptable. I think what really holds back this film is budgetary restraints. Procuring acceptable financing commitments from Hollywood has been a career long problem with all of Carpenter's films. Movie studios just don't want to shell out big bucks to directors that don't suck up to ignorant audiences.",They Live

196,keihan,The village idiot of films...,6,24 February 2000,"""They Live"" a profound movie? You gotta be kidding me...at least in the traditional sense. The production values are too ridiculous, the explaination for why the '80s was a time to be loathed is too convinient, and exactly how bullets did those guns have in them? AND YET...and yet I can't help thinking about it without a quote from Eric Hoffer (quoted by Harlan Ellison in his ""An Edge in My Voice"" collection of essays) floating to mind: ""What monstrosities would walk the streets were some people's faces as unfinished as their minds."" Kinda puts the first time Piper puts on the shades in perspective, doesn't it?For the remake of ""Scarface"", Oliver Stone wrote a line during the drunk scene that, while funny, is pretty much what any writer worth his salt tries to accomplish: ""I tell the truth, even when I lie."" When I watch ""They Live"", I see, in the lie of this film, everything I ever hated about the 1980's. From the subliminals in the signs to the fascist tactics employed to beat down the resistance to the passive acceptance of the status quo, the entire film is just a fun-house mirror reflection of the way things were. If Carpenter weren't just as interested in having fun as he was with sprinkling in the subtext, this might have been a better film...but that still doesn't mean that I consider it worthless.No one is going to mistake Roddy Piper for Laurence Olivier, but he does a fairly good job with what he's got. He's not quite as interesting as, say, Snake Plissken, but he does come off as an average guy who's been beaten down by life, but still cares about the world around him. One great line that he has that is NEVER quoted sums up the character rather well: ""The white line's in the middle of the road. That's the worst place in the world to drive."" I can't help but crack up when I think about his fight with Frank just to put a lousy (ableit special) pair of sunglasses.The ending kinda kills things a little, but if one wants to get profound, I suppose one could say that it serves as a metaphor for what people some two or three decades down the line are going to see about the 1980's...but maybe not. This film is rather like a village idiot, spouting so much gibberish that it's sometimes hard to catch the pearls of wisdom mixed in with it. John Carpenter remains, to me, the king of deliberate camp (as opposed to the unintended camp of the Mummy remake).",They Live
197,EdYerkeRobins,Carpenter's Overlooked Gem,8,15 May 2002,"John Carpenter has always been willing to take ""risks"" as a director with personal, lower-budget projects with actors who are decent but not exactly Oscar candidates and special effects that are top-of-the-line for their budget range but still can't compare with a bid-budget production. Sometimes this works wonderfully, as in his most famous film, ""Halloween"", and sometimes it doesn't work so well, as with 2001's ""Ghosts of Mars"". ""They Live"", produced in 1988, is somewhat of a midpoint between these two films: on one end there's a very enjoyable sci-fi film which uses its ""nothing is real"" theme for social commentary, with a surprisingly good performance from wrestler-turned-actor Roddy Piper, and on the other end, the film's alien effects (which, given that they're the antagonists, is a pretty major part of the film) have decayed over the years and left the film with a tinted cheese/b-movie feel.Although wrestlers have to ""act"" for promotional vignettes and in the ring, anyone who's seen a Hulk Hogan movie or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in ""The Scorpion King"" can attest that that acting doesn't translate on the screen at all.  Though he has put on his share of cult classic fare, Roddy Piper is definitely the exception to that rule.  Though he still suffers slightly from overacting (though not to the extent that made Johnson look joyfully absurd in ""The Scorpion King""), he's believable as both a blue-collar everyday man and a hero.  His wrestling skills are also referenced via their use in the film's famous ten-minute back alley brawl between Piper (whose character is never named in the film) and co-star Keith David (Frank). Piper certainly never won any awards for his performance, but it's more than enough for the film, and he even has a couple of classic action-style lines.The film is also surprising because of its effective social commentary. The theme of the world as seen through human eyes not being ""real"" is fairly standard in sci-fi, but that's also because it's open to so much interpretation.  In the late 80s, the U.S. was a mess, economically and socially.  The film's setting is true to that, with Piper and Frank wallowing in and putting up with their own social misery by residing in a homeless/lower-class commune of sorts, only to later literally break into and destroy foundations of corporate America.  Scenes in Los Angeles where the ""real world"" is revealed to Piper for the first time are chillingly effective, particularly a whole line of news-stands where the news' subliminal messages have been revealed: ""Obey"" and ""Stay Asleep"" being the most pronounced, though there are many others.  The reason these scenes and their messages are so effective is because that was definitely how the world seemed at the time to those in the ever-increasing lower class of America, full of hidden messages forcing them to unquestionably follow the rich whose only goal in life was to help others in the upper-class get richer.  This is represented not only through the aliens' dialogue relating giving promotions and material items to other aliens, but through the actual upper-class humans siding with the aliens because it'll lead to more economic gain for them in the short-run.Though they are the main villains, unfortunately the aliens haven't aged well.  They look less menacing than just goofy mixtures between bad zombie make-up and bug-eyed insects.  Also, as the film gets closer and closer to the end, more and more small holes and nitpicking begins to surface, but it still doesn't detract too much from the overall film.  As it stands, ""They Live"" is surprisingly excellent, the text-book definition of a sleeper if there ever was one  not the best movie ever by any standards, but very good and relatively unrecognized.  This is easily the best movie with a wrestler in it, but more importantly, it's arguably John Carpenter's last good movie.",They Live
198,MadReviewer,When Bug-Eyed Monsters Become Politicians . . . .,7,28 August 2001,"John Carpenter's ""They Live"" is really a fiendishly clever reworking of the ""Bug-Eyed Monsters From Outer Space"" movies of the 1950s.  Instead of featuring insect-like aliens trying to take over the world, though, ""They Live"" features aliens that have managed to disguise themselves as human beings . . . and they aren't ""trying"" to take over world, because they've already succeeded in taking it over.  Politicians, newscasters, policemen, business executives -- these are the positions in human society that the aliens have assumed, and as such, they effectively rule the world.  It's an offbeat take on a conventional movie formula, and for the most part, it works fairly successfully.""They Live"" is a story about Nada (Roddy Piper), a downtrodden, unemployed construction worker just looking for a job and a little happiness.  (Those looking for a shred of subtle subtext in this film will note that Nada's name literally means ""nothing"".) While wandering aimlessly through some city streets, Nada discovers a strange pair of sunglasses that allow him to see a different world than the one he sees normally: a world blanketed with subliminal messages.  Magazines and television ads flash messages like ""Obey"", ""Submit to Authority"", and ""Conform"".  Nada is also able to see the true form of all his supposedly human authority figures (policemen, politicians, and the like) -- they are all bug-eyed aliens, dedicated to keeping the human race happy, dumb, and subdued.  Nada, who's already tired of being pushed around and told what to do, decides that's there's only one way to take care of this alien menace -- and that's to take matters into his own hands, preferably with an automatic weapon . . .""They Live"" is an interesting, if not always successful, movie because of its ability to take some standard movie formulas and inject some new twists -- and realism -- into them.  It's not the typical tale of humans beating back confounded aliens without too many setbacks or difficulties. Instead, there's some real problems -- Nada (and the other resistance fighters he encounters) find that not all of their efforts to fight or defeat the aliens actually work; the aliens actually use all the vast resources at their disposal to their full advantage, instead of constantly being dumbfounded by the human freedom fighters; and so on.  (As an example of an original plot twist, I liked the fact that the aliens use the TV networks to portray Nada as a psychotic killer to the public at large after he shoots some aliens; after all, without the benefit of Nada's strange sunglasses, the aliens look like ordinary, everyday human beings . . .)  Just when the events of ""They Live"" look like they're going to become predictable, something happens that completely shifts the film in a brand-new and original direction.  This originality is occasionally hit-or-miss -- sometimes, the brand-new and original direction works a lot less effectively than a more predictable direction would've worked -- but ""They Live"" deserves credit for constantly daring to be different, if nothing else.The other factor that makes ""They Live"" such a fun, interesting movie is its hero -- Nada.  Instead of making Nada the stereotypical hero of a bug-eyed monster movie -- i.e., the scientist whom nobody believes until it's far too late, or the strong, silent soldier battling grimly against overwhelming odds -- Carpenter makes Nada a complete moron.  True, Nada's a well-meaning moron, but that doesn't change the fact that he's about as smart as a bag of rocks . . . and yet he represents humanity's only hope of survival. There's no subtlety when it comes to Nada.  If aliens need killing, then he kills aliens.  He has no concept of long term planning, or losing a battle in order to win a war -- he's a very violent and very stupid man dedicated to ridding Earth of its disguised alien rulers, and he simply does what he thinks is right in order to accomplish this mission.  What adds to this is the fact that his stupidity doesn't confound the aliens -- they recognize Nada for the Neanderthal that he really is, and deal with him in ways that actually make logical sense.  (For example, Nada always seems mystified that the aliens can hunt him down after his little alien killing sprees -- he never seems to fully grasp the concept that aliens control the police departments, the military, and so on . . .)  It's kind of a backhanded compliment, but Roddy Piper plays Nada beautifully; it's hard to think of too many other actors who could play such a determined moron so well.  (As a side note -- it's also interesting to notice how Nada automatically assumes that the bug-eyed aliens are evil.  He turns out to be right, of course, but he manages to gun down a decent number of aliens before finding even a shred of proof that his assumptions are correct.)There's no denying that there are some significant problems with ""They Live"".  The ending is abrupt and makes little sense; the production values are pathetically shoddy; and apart from Roddy Piper, the cast is more or less forgettable.  Still, ""They Live"" is a decent, solid movie that largely succeeds in its quest to provide some original, offbeat entertainment. For that, it deserves a lot of credit.  Grade: B . . . for a darn good ""B"" movie.",They Live

Written by Carpenter and based off a short story by Ray Nelson we have WWF legend 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper (off the top of my head the best role I have ever seen a wrestler play) play a down-on-his-luck kind of everyman. Just trying to survive, trying to find work, but still trying to look at life in a positive way. He gets a new job, befriends a co-worker in Keith David, who in turn leads him to a shanty town soup kitchen where he can eat, sleep and shower. Piper witnesses some strange happenings with the leader of the soup kitchen (Peter Jason) across the street at a church. He ends up finding some sunglasses after a weird conversation about perhaps some sort of resistance taking hold. But after Piper slide those sunglasses on God what sights he sees.I love the premise and as usual Carpenter's directing style. To me Piper puts in a real good performance and most of the time you aren't just watching some hammy wrestling performance. The main thing that I think needed improvement were the effects. Even on my first viewing which may have been like 4 years after its release the effects were so cheesy. By my eyes some of the effects are substandard, mostly being the effects on the aliens. To me if they had gotten say Rob Bottin to do the effects I think this film would have totally rocked. In saying all of this Carpenter has created a big-time sci-fi/horror cult flick that I really do strongly suggest to those who enjoy those types of films. There is a great message being said by Carpenter and really do enjoy this 80s classic. Also starring Meg Foster and George 'Buck' Flower.",They Live

The last scene is a total DOOZY!As is already noted here on IMDb, The film has also become a cult classic giving rise to many memorable quotes that have since appeared elsewhere...

207,asandor,I have come here to chew bubblegum and write a review...,7,15 November 2016,"And I am all out of bubblegum (and my reviews stink). They Live! is a John Carpenter film starring Roddy Piper as our hero, Nada He is a drifter, who wanders the homeless camps of big cities looking for work. One day,he stumbles upon a conspiracy, and a big one! Aliens are actually in control of the Earth. They use subliminal propaganda and staff all the major agencies to maintain control over the rest of the Earth's humans.How is this plot discovered? Magical sun glasses! Putting on these glasses allows you to see the aliens real messages, and allows you to see through their human disguise. Nada teams up with his work buddy Frank to try and infiltrate this alien organization, and take them down! They Live! is a Carpenter film, and so is very simple on the plot side. The acting is hammy, the plot predictable, and the film features a whole lot of camp. However, this film is very enjoyable (in the style of many of Carpenters films). It does not take itself seriously, delivers some campy lines and is a blast to watch. The film has some fun action scenes, the effects are wonderful on the practical effects side, and the dialogue and overall camp charm that the film features will leave you smiling. This may not be Carpenter's best film overall, but it is fun, delivers one of films best lines, and has a unique charm that many of Carpenter's films possess. All in all, a worthy watch if you are looking for something fun, light, and entertaining.",They Live

The aliens have secretly arrived, and are taking over the planet through subliminal coercion. Their messages are literally hidden under signs, and their true visages are cloaked with a powerful signal they transmit from a Newstation tower. But there's hope. A scientist has stumbled upon their world domination plot and created sunglasses that actually see through the cloaking signal.

What Burton forgot was that not only were those films silly and cheap but they had a message contained within them (even Plan 9 From Outer Space), often anti-communist.  That is why They Live is such a great film.  It has good action (although there could be more), really weird looking aliens and a message within the films plot.  The films poking at the ""me generation"" of the 80's is even more fun to watch today because it's so laughable (much like the 50's films are today) but that doesn't take away any to the fun you get watching the film.

""They Live"" is a slow moving film to begin with, until I was shocked into seeing what John Nada sees when he puts on his super cool shades.Keith David who plays ""Frank"" is a great actor and he is also good in another Carpenter film ""The Thing"", which is even better than this. I havent seen Roddy Piper in anything else but the wrestling, but he puts in a suprisingly good performance. For anyone who likes something different then this film is for you.

Taking into consideration its a low budget sci-fi movie, there are holes in the story and things that don't make much sense. I saw this movie many years ago, and from memory it didn't seem very good.

213,anonreviewer,"elite, parasitic subsociety exploits American working class--reflects real American society?",10,25 June 2004,"This movie is not so much about aliens who are hiding among us, but instead it taps into the deeply submerged suspicion held by most of us that we are being manipulated and taken advantage of by the elite of American society, by our leaders, by the rich, etc. Also, we sometimes feel that we are manipulated and programmed (in a subtle way) to respect hierarchical authority ( e.g., the ""OBEY"" subliminal command from the movie). Some leftist thinkers might say that human societies are in a way being parasitized by the elite of their societies, and that the elite operate as a parasitic sub-society, living off of the lower classes. America might be said to be operated more in such a fashion (i.e., parasitized by the elite) than are the countries of western Europe. Obvious examples of this parasitic behavior are the ""golden handshakes"" and backscratching exchanged between corporate CEO's and the Boards of Directors of their companies. But it is far more pervasive than just that._They_Live_ uses the invisible alien elite as a proxy for our suspicions about how we are all being exploited by the elite of our real-life society, and how these elite are subtly programming us to accept this exploitation.So, the major theme of the movie is not, as another poster correctly pointed out, about being manipulated to be good little consumers in a crassly commercial world. No, it is far more profound than that. Instead, it is more about how the working class Americans in _They Live_ are being exploited by the elite upper crust, who, in the movie, happen to be aliens, but who, in the real world, are a subsociety that use their collective power to exploit the rest of us.Unfortunately, this movie sometimes has an unintentionally comic air to it. Still, the exploration of that theme is so rare in pop culture, and that theme is so profound, and reaches so far into what American society is, was, and is becoming, that this movie is a Must-See for anyone with an interest in politics and sociology.",They Live

Its about opening the eyes on the behaviors which are not really human, because they are missing emotions and care for humans.It really hurts to open the eyes, which is greatly demonstrated by the street fight between the main characters.The greatest criticism on this movie is probably it's rhythm issue. But then again, this is ingeniously implemented, as getting conscious, open-minded is a very long tedious process, where you will face many opposition from your own close environment.Considering this is a movie from 1988, it has never stopped becoming more and more an appropriate allegory of our close future",They Live
215,wierzbowskisteedman,Another JC classic,10,15 August 2005,"A excessively paranoid action film, 'They Live' sees struggling labourer Rowdy Roddy Piper stumble across a secret organisation that is trying to rebel against a race of aliens that live amongst humans like normal people. They are the successful ones who get the best jobs and all the promotions, while more and more real humans get stuck in the working class due to being held back by the subliminal messaging the aliens use to control them, hidden amongst billboards, television shows and basically everywhere. These aliens can only be seen with special sunglasses, and when he stumbles across a pair, Piper starts kicking ass because he's out of bubblegum.Some people say this is Carpenter's last great film; I say wait ten years until the likes of 'Escape from L.A' and 'Vampires' develop the cult followings that are already beginning to swell. Shot on a shoestring budget like all the Carpenter classics, 'They Live' wasn't much of a commercial success (like all the Carpenter classics), probably dismissed because it had a wrestler in the lead. But people have come to respect it over time (like all the Carpenter classics) and appreciate it as the intelligent thriller it is. The idea of the subliminal messaging and hidden aliens is a perfect one to tap into everyone's fears and angers about modern Western society. This is a gripping backdrop, but after all, at heart 'They Live' is an action film. And it defiantly doesn't disappoint in that aspect. Piper is fun and charismatic in the lead, delivering some classic one liners like ""Momma don't like tattletales"" and of course the legendary Bubblegum line. Once he gets his sunglasses the action really gets going, with the bank shootout and his fistfight with Keith David being the standout scenes. The latter is a scene which I regard as one of the best non martial art fight sequences ever. The film keeps to Carpenter's typical style, with a western atmosphere, a cool techno soundtrack and plenty of mindless killing. This is one of his overlooked masterpieces, a smart and inventive action film that is not to be missed.",They Live

What I enjoy about Carpenter is the seeming simplicity of his direction, and his horror, despite the often extraordinary circumstances of the plots, benefits from the surreal realities he captures so magically.Roddy Piper has the chops for just this sort of gig, and his ""everyday man"" character shines through. He's a real ""working-class hero"" who shows us just what a real fight scene between two tough guys really is.Budget restraints are evident, and that gives the film and its look and it's low-tech, sci-fi vibe an extra boost.

217,mkw-5,"Really good movie; Intelligent, deep, funny, entertaining...",8,16 January 2006,"... And of course very well made, because it's from Carpenter from his good ole days (actually I haven't seen his recent films, from the nineties or so, so I cannot say how good his ""days"" are now; They might be good also). The plot is bravely ""stupid"" (if you look the surface), but also ""secretly"" intelligent and deep, just the same thing as in very many scifi, horror, and even action movies: You have to look at them with open eyes to get the messages. I think this movie is much more interesting, and much more realistic and intellectual, than let's say some french art movie (Farthenheit 951 or something). This is real art. It's from this world, not from some artificial art movie marshmallow fantasy-world. Of course it's very funny film also. You may see the main actor (he's some pro-wrestler?) as some kind of a walking joke. But actually he is perfect for this role. He is like some mythological hero, just like Schwarzenegger or so. He is a symbol. The movie is filled with really good jokes and one-liners that you'll never forget. For example, when the main character comes to a bank, in his intent to kill some ""aliens"", he shouts: ""I'm here to chew bubblegum and kick ass! And I'm all outta bubblegum..."" And another comment from him, after he has had a ten-minute long fight with somebody: ""Ain't love great!"" This is a great cult movie.

218,Nothinggrandproductions,Has ambitions but fails to deliver on nearly every level,4,8 July 2014,"I think one of the things I hate most about films is when they seem to set-up these grand political ideas or social commentaries but never actually follow through with them. They Live directed by John Carpenter is absolutely one of those films that I was shocked to find that it had actually pretty great reviews online and is seemingly well received as a whole. John Nada (Roddy Piper) is an unemployed drifter who gets work in Los Angeles and becomes friends with another construction worker Frank Armitage (Keith David) and they both live in a local soup kitchen. Nada notices strange things going on with a church nearby and a helicopter flying above them in more than one instance. But the main strange thing happening is the TV signal being constantly interrupted with a warning about those in power. But suddenly the police come and bulldoze and attack the soup kitchen and leave the viewer confused but I guesscurious? I'm still not entirely sure that bulldozing an entire place without context was a smart choice right from the start but that's a minor complaint compared to the rest of the film. Nada escapes but he also stole a box of sunglasses from the church and he discovers that putting them on causes him to see many different things, for one thing, black and white cinematography is used for the POV shots of Nada and I actually quite enjoyed that artistic choice but beyond that, Nada sees what everything in the city is really telling him. The advertisements that are lies to make you purchase things change to the words ""OBEY"" or ""CONFORM"" and all the products around him instead show the words of ""CONSUME"" and all the sudden I was getting excited. I thought maybe this film was going to be great but everything pretty much falls apart within ten minutes. Nada also sees certain people with skeleton/alien-like faces and without any indication Nada just starts shooting the living hell outta them. And just wait a damn minute, isn't there a problem with that? He hasn't a damn clue what is actually going on but his first plan is just shoot the living hell out of everyone who is supposedly an alien but he actually has no idea? It's absurd and ridiculous.The movie then completely devolves into a generic 80s action flick instead of having anything smart to say politically. The characters are bland and two-dimensional and many of the actors are mediocre at best. We have plenty of bad one-liners that only get soft chuckles. We have scene after scene of admittedly well-directed action scenes but they become boring when they just come one after another. John Carpenter is (was because let's be honest, has he made anything of merit in like the past 15 years or so?) a competent director and his movies have actually explored decent political or social ideas through Escape From New York (one of my favorite films of all time) or The Thing and the dude helped invent the slasher genre with Halloween. What happened here? This movie could have been incredibly smart. This movie could have said plenty of great things about the effects of advertisements on the human brain, the effects of television and how it can actually very much negatively effect people or influence their thinking in a bad way, and essentially could have made some very serious comments on how many people lack thinking for themselves or real independence. I do admit that maybe the movie was ahead of its time especially considering this movie could easily be remade nowadays with the effect of the Internet on people, which goes far deeper than television with social media outlets. Oddly, I would love a remake of this film but with much deeper ideas and exploring the content it should have explored instead of boring me with action sequences that are a dime a dozen in Hollywood. I need less of this Hollywood with its action scenes and more important commentary on the state of the world and humans as a wholethat's why I love films in first place.

220,Progressive-Element,"B-movie thrills, with a political edge",9,23 May 2013,"They Live is the second of a planned three-picture deal John Carpenter had with production company Alive Films - the first was Prince of Darkness.This tale of aliens living among us, is on the surface, a neat, somewhat tongue-in-cheek popcorn action flick, with a formidable hero in the form of Roddy Piper, who does a better job than he's often given credit for. We are with him almost throughout the film, seeing and discovering things as he does. Underneath it all is a sharp attack on the 'greed is good' era it was made in, with the rich and powerful corrupted by their greed, while those less fortunate are left to suffer.When Roddy puts on a special pair of sunglasses, we see the real world that the aliens have set up, and that the humans are sleepwalking through - social apathy being another key point that comes under fire.Ads blare out, consumer culture and materialism is in our face, but the glasses reveal their sinister true meaning, and it makes one take a second glance at everything when one walks through the nearest town.And then there's the aliens - right-wing, ultra-capitalist, exploiting the poor for their own ends. 'I figured it would be something like this,' mutters Roddy's character, seeing the President in his real form...Once the set-up's over, it's time for the action. When the aliens are alerted to Roddy's discovery of their presence, tensions rise dramatically as our hero finds himself on the run from the alien-controlled authorities when he kills some of them in self-defence, and then out of anger takes out a few more when he winds up in a bank, ''all out of bubble-gum''.When he finally manages to convince his friend Frank - Keith David - after a gratuitous but amusing fight, they meet up with a human resistance group, and it's here the film goes downhill somewhat, as it meanders it's way to it's bittersweet climax, though the ending provides plenty of amusement.Not a perfect film, and the alien make-up isn't too great, but it works as both a B-movie thrill ride, and an angry protest.",They Live

This movie could have reached the status of huge cult favorite and have delivered an intelligent message - albeit masked by a comedy element - to a lot of people if only it was better developed.To be fair, the movie lost itself after a while. I don't blame Roddy Piper. He's not great in this movie but he delivers a fair performance, certainly better than what most of the former sportsmen delivered in their movie career. However, there's way too much of him walking around in poor neighborhoods, and that fight scene is just way too long... at one point, the movie just drags, and that's a pity for a movie that had more than one smart thing to say.Make no mistake: ""They Live"" looks silly but it's not.

This movie was actually quite well down, considering it did not have a blockbuster budget.I would rather watch this than waste my time on the Matrix, which I think is a complete waste of time. The main plot of the movie was Nada discovering a worldwide conspiracy that used subliminal messages to ""herd the sheep"". Is this not a metaphor of what we see ever day? The media, commercials, billboards, etc, use subliminal messaging to encourage the actions of the public at large.John Carpenter did a wonderful job. Roddy Piper's acting abilities were definitely above average, which is a lot more that I will ever to be able to say about anything Keanu Reeves has ever done.

I've had quite a few people suggest it to me and it often gets high ratings on various websites that I check for movie reviews and synopsis, plus the whole ""I'm here to chew bubblegum and kick butt and I'm all out of bubblegum"" scene gets played a lot when people talk about this movie so when I saw that Peacock had it available for free I thought I would go ahead and check it out.This is no ""edge of your seat"" movie like Speed was the first time you watch it, nor is it your typical horror movie. Acting is okay, nothing special, the alley fight scene is both comedic and enough to cause you to wince in pain at some of the WWE body slams. Some of the punches being thrown miss their mark by a mile and special effects are cheesy but storyline is decent enough.I didn't know that John Carpenter directed (as well as wrote this, apparently) and had I known it I would have gone out of my way to see it much sooner, but I shouldn't be surprised.I can see why its a cult classic and will remain so for quite some time and its one that I'll probably be adding to my DVD/Blu-ray collection if I find it at a decent enough price.",They Live

231,KnightLander,Uh ... They Live!,6,20 June 2005,"They live! They breath! They look like your cousin! Who are they? And what do they want? Well, they want you. They're the aliens of John Carpenter's They Live.Wrestler Roddy Piper plays a homeless construction worker who finds himself and his home of lowlifes being run down by police officers late one night. The next day, Roddy decides to take a walk and finds himself in the church across the street. Using his supa-wrestla-kick, he knocks down a section of wall and - voila! - he finds a few dozen boxes of sunglasses. Big deal, right? Wrong. When old Roddy here puts on them sunglasses, he sees the world as it really is - about 40% of our population are otherwordly invaders intent on conquering our earth. Through the media, stock market, and billboards, of course. They don't wanna kill us! They just wanna wipe us all out non-violently. Of course, wrestler Roddy doesn't care. He teams up with his buddie, grabs a few machine guns, and sets out to blow 'em all to hell.This is ""They Live"", a minor yet popular film in horror master John Carpenter's career. While no where near as good as hits like The Thing or Halloween, They Live is one of Carpenter's most entertaining and simple films ever. It's also one of my favorites. It features fine acting thrown into some completely unbelievable situations; nice direction, but nothing special; and some very cool creature effects. Don't rent the film expecting any horror masterpiece. With lines like ""Life's a bitch, and she's back in heat!"" or ""You look like your face fell in the cheese dip back in 1956"", you know you aren't going to find the greatest sci-fi thriller you've ever seen. If you keep that in mind, I think you'll find a fun albeit plain film.Overall, I liked They Live, but at the end you can't help wanting more than you got. Although, I must admit, the final minute is outrageous. They Live, that we know. The question is - will you live? (Yes, I realize that was almost as bad as Roddy's bubble gum speech)",They Live
232,pazuzu-2,Fun but paranoid liberal fantasy about the Reagan years,7,1 June 2006,"I dug this film when I first saw it. I saw it again last night and still dug it but found myself laughing at what John Carpenter obviously thought was deep social comment on the Reagan years.I love John Carpenter, when he's at his best (""THE THING"") nobody can beat him. But John, just like anyone can cross the line into the sanctimonious thinly disguised statement of policy according to the director.That's fine if the statement is better thought out and more complex then the underlying one of ""They Live"".Still, in this movie, even though that line is indeed crossed, it still has enough cheesy, campy Sci-fi appeal to halfway overlook the shallow socio-political world view.The movie was made in 1988, in the midst of a robust economic expansion. Yet, it chooses to portray an America that is on the skids for all but a few.And those few are either Repub... I mean Aliens exploiting the planet and the masses and Reagan Democr.... er I mean the human turncoats that are in league with them to enrich themselves.The Aliens can only be exposed with special glasses (along with all the subliminal propaganda that is printed in magazines, billboards, TV and even on currency). I don't know how those glasses can reorder the scan lines of a cathode ray tube in order to show hidden things on the TV but I guess I shouldn't try to figure that one out. The exposed aliens look like they are missing the skin on their faces or maybe they are wearing masked with some sort of holographic generator to generate facial features. Okay, I promise to stop trying to figure this out. Okay, you can see the Aliens with the glasses but how do you identify the human turncoats? Well, they are the characters that have more than one nickel to rub together mostly. Because, in Carpenter's world, no one comes by wealth honestly (except for movie directors, perhaps).SPOILER: For instance, how many were really surprised that Holly Thomson was a turncoat? All you have to do is look at her nice apartment and you could've written that surprise yourself.Still, all that is easily put aside so you can enjoy the lines and the moments.Lines like ""I'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum and I'm all out of bubblegum"" and ""Life's a bitch and she's back in heat"" and moments like the ultimately hilarious 5+ minute long fist fight between Roddy Piper and Keith David's characters.A 5 minute rumble over Roddy wanting Keith to put on the glasses so he too can see the Aliens and messages.I don't care how macho bull#%$* you are, most would just put on the glasses instead of having a couple broken ribs BUT NOOOOOOOO......Not that it slowed them down any. I mean, Roddy Piper was already tossed out a plate glass window from a couple stories before they fought and seemed only momentarily encumbered.Then, it took only a few scenes after this knock down drag out for both of them to look completely recovered.Too bad universal health-care wasn't on the radar in 1988, John could've had them both had to go to the hospital after the fight and encounter a whole new group of aliens bent on keeping prescription drugs and medical care high. But that may be another story.Finally, what really bears mentioning about ""They Live"" is how it must've inspired ""The Matrix"" to a certain extent. Aliens coming to Earth and hide themselves by altering our perception of reality.Main characters break out of that alternate reality and try to take down the aliens through lots of ammo and insurrection ""Whoa..!""Ultimataly, ""They Live"" is more enjoyable because it's only pretentious in it's politics. ""The Matrix"" is pretentious across the board (with CGI, I guess they can afford to be).It also lacks John Carpenter's sense of fun (not to mention his scoring. John is the king of making minimalist, repetitious background music for his movies that somehow work)And any time Rowdy Roddy Piper is not in his kilt, it's a plus (hey, he turned in a decent performance).",They Live

The idea that we are surrounded by aliens disguised as humans unless you wear some special spectacles is a good idea.The only bit in the movie that really gets on my nerves is the bit where Roddy Piper tries to get Keith David to wear the glasses but he won't and a rather unnecessary long and protracted fight happens.

243,chain67,Extremely Underrated Thriller,8,24 January 2001,"""They Live"" is one of the most original and underrated sci-fi action movies i've ever seen. Eventhough the acting isn't spectacular, and by the end turns into a down right urban action movie, ""They Live"" is one of the most entertaining ever.  The plot is quite simple, Nada(Roddy Piper) a homeless drifter stumbles upon a pair of sunglasses through which you can see the world for what it really is, a communist type environment controlled by aliens, and then joins up with his buddy Frank(Keith David) to stop them. In the middle of all this there a lot of great one liners, a lot of harebrained action and one of the longest, and best, fist fights ever filmed.   The way John Carpenter directs really makes the film work. Everything seems downbeat and realistic. The acting of ex-pro wrestler Roddy Piper is better than expected but not too spectacular and Keith David isn't at all convincing. But none of that matters, the real reason to see this movie is just to be entertained and on that level is suceeds. My Rating is 8/10",They Live
244,shaneo632,"A witty, enjoyable ride with scathing social commentary...",8,27 November 2007,"Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):John Carpenter's ""They Live"" could easily have gone either way - an overstuffed failure, or a witty commentary on modern society. Fortunately, with Carpenter's steady hand, this film assumes the latter - it makes remarks about social inequality which are relevant even near-twenty years on, taking the viewer on an extremely fun ride.Needless to say, the film wastes not a second in establishing its social context - our protagonist (Roddy Piper) is a down-on-his luck drifter, unable to find work, seemingly kept down by ""the man"". As he walks past someone, their glazed-over eyes staring into a window full of televisions, one must consider that the considerations this film makes are about as subtle as a brick being hurled through that very window, but nevertheless, Carpenter raises important issues effectively.Eventually scoring a job on a work-site, Nada becomes fast friends with Frank (Keith David), a hard-done-by individual himself, yet Nada initially sees him as simply being too impatient with society and expecting too much from life. Conversely, Nada is of the belief that the everyman can succeed in American society, but alas, his stance is about to change drastically.In his travels, Nada also comes across a series of strange television transmissions, spouting what is dismissed by most as the verbiage of madmen, urging the everyman to rise up and revolt against their controlling oppressors, who are supposedly preventing racial diversity, allowing an underclass to grow, and exerting their hegemonic powers (primarily money) to these ends. Furthermore, Nada also encounters a shady group of individuals posing as a choir group, whilst something far more sinister is quite abundantly afoot.Things very quickly turn to chaos as a fleet of police officers arrive, riot shields and all, and at this stage, it's all quite the exciting mystery. The real treat of the film comes when Nada discovers a box of sunglasses, and upon trying on a pair, discovers that hidden messages are placed all about our world, instructing us to ""obey"", ""watch TV"" and have ""no independent thought"", among other things. It's a fantastic concept, and everything about its execution is extremely pleasing to the eye - the monochrome representation of the world through these glasses, and also the alteration of everyday objects such as magazines to appear as blank slates with instructions written on them.Further still, those already assimilated by this force assume a ghoulish facial appearance when the glasses are worn, as evidenced by Nada's encounter with an aloof businessman. As with The Thing, Carpenter and his team are to once again be praised for their stellar effects work - the skeletal guise of those already ""infected"" is both terrifying and authentic looking, having stood the test of time fantastically.Piper's reaction to these ghouls is gold - his natural defenses invite him to make jokes at the hideousness of them, naturally offending those around him observing, who have not seen the world through Nada's magical glasses. It isn't long before Nada's actions earn him the attention of a great number of these things, and he is ultimately forced to resort to violence in order to survive, quite an interesting commentary in itself when considered within the context of freedom fighting and revolutions.Nada's transformation into a certified baddass is a little too fast, but it's so much fun and so enjoyable to watch that we don't care. Nada, shotgun in hand, now goes about dispatching as many of these beasts as possible, and if that wasn't task enough, he becomes a wanted man as a result, with both the monsters and the police (who believe him to be a communist freedom fighter) on his tail.Nada naturally has a difficult time convincing people of what's going on, resulting in him both being knocked out of a window and down a hill by a woman, and engaging in a refreshingly gritty five-minute slug-fest with Keith David's character whilst trying to convince him to try the sunglasses on. Much of the difficulty also seems to stem from the fact that most people are likely to simply humour a seeming madman wielding a gun rather than actually try the glasses on and see if he's telling the truth.The film's final set piece is a wildly overblown (in the best sense possible) war between those awakened to the truth, and those not, with bullets and explosions hurtling in every direction. It has a degree of inherent cheese to it, but again, this is in the best way possible - two warring sides alternatively hiding behind bins for cover and then firing at their enemy has never, and probably never will be, so much fun. As Piper and David sweep through a building, destroying waves of soldiers in hails of bullets, what could have been a conventional and tiresome shooting exercise is kept vibrant due to Carpenter's original use of imagery and superb soundtrack. By the time They Live reaches its end, there are genuinely surprising turns and unexpected departures, reaching a climax which, through his actions, solidifies Piper's Nada as an action hero and role model for the everyman tucked away in most of us.They Live never endeavours to take itself too seriously - sure, it has a message to it, that we must remember to take a breather from buying things we don't need and working 40-hour weeks every so often, but even in the final moments of the film, we're left belly laughing at what is an all-around extremely entertaining film. Piper, surprisingly enough, is a believable protagonist, bringing both the presence and macho charisma that his other vocation requires, and Keith David is a likewise entertaining disgruntled sidekick. John Carpenter is something of an unrecognised auteur, frequently writing, directing and scoring his films, each with a unique flair that deserves praise, and as far as his modernised Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers-with-bells-on goes, I say ""Kudos!"".",They Live
245,DJBlackSwan,They Live: the Multidemensional Dominionism of Conservative Dystopia!,9,31 December 2005,"Marry and Reproduce. Consume.Submit. Watch TV. No independent thought, no ideas, buy, obey authority. Sleep. Doubt humanity. Conform. All typically hierarchical, top-down, cutthroat, conservative, anti-human ideals, as enforced by a riot-gear police state that beats up blind Black men and bulldozes homeless settlements.Except, conservatives/Reaganites/""free enterprisers"" and other reactionaries aren't lizards from spaceships, profiting from the coldness of the conservative heart. That's where ""it's only a movie"" backfires on us, bearing as it does some accurate reflections of the Reagan Era excesses. Thus, they Live still leaves us with only two choices, complicity or rebellion, and in this movie, both turn out to be radical acts.Because, as much as political and social conservatives in the United States snivel and whimper about ""the media"", and ""liberal Hollywood"", they depend on both for their survival and perpetuity. After all, their beloved union-busting ""teflon president"" and Governator were spat out onto the American populace by so-called ""liberal Hollywood"". Conservatives also get to add to their roster successful governors who built their names on pro wrestling, as well as a host of friendly witnesses to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), including a conservative senator from California, a former MGM song-and-dance contemporary of Ronald Reagan named George Murphy. So I don't know what they are continually whining about, seriously.And anyone who recalls the Reaganite-California 80s, the political and social context that has given us the Bush 90s-00s, remembers the police brutality of the LAPD, the battering ram, gated communities enforced by private police, the rise of homelessness, Reaganomics, and of course, the beginnings of cable and small-screen wrestling. It should go without saying that the camera ready surveillance society that passed for science fiction in '88-'89 -- for which we should suspend disbelief -- is today a routine part of American life.And speaking of all-seeing eyes, t'was blind, but now I see...access to higher Truth via Black people and 2-D black and white glasses. It's true: Black American religion is the central redemptive force in They Live. Note the ""African Methodist EPISCOPAL Free Church"" (a made-up conflagration of the ""African Methodist Episcopal"" and white-Methodist derived ""Evangelical Free"" churches), the broadcast site of the Cable 54 hacks. The Psalm 23-quoting blind Black preacher (Raymond St. Jacques) who in fact can ""see"", and transmits the broadcast hack of the Eeeeeeevil Tee Vee station. And, by extension, handsome Keith David reprising his solid supporting man roles, this time as Frank, the reluctant revolutionary. Oh yes, and despite the mullet, Roddy looks GREAT shirtless in his snug fitting jeans...wow!They Live: the heavy-handed Fight Club of the 80s, without the irony and with a different kind of humor?Or, They Live: the logical sequel to Halloween 3.

247,tacmovies,"Cheesy, but some of the best one liners ever!",6,7 January 2010,"Story: Aliens invade and a guy fights them with guns while spouting one liners. Seriously, what more do you want? Carpenter spends a lot of time jumping up and down on his soapbox, with the hidden messages on the money and the billboards being oh so subtle (""This is your god!""), but it's done in such a cheesy, over the top way that it becomes quite hilarious. There are a few moments of plot induced stupidity, mainly coming from the bum who turns out to be working with the aliens not noticing that Piper's face was on TV as being wanted when he takes Piper inside the alien base. C Acting: Roddy Piper does an excellent job of playing a very understated character at the beginning of this movie. Then once he notices the aliens around him he starts spouting one liners in an over the top fashion. In many ways it felt like his character had split personalities. I also love the fact that the first offensive move he does in this movie is a good old fashioned clothesline from pro wrestling. Keith David is probably the star actor of this movie, unless you count the fight between him and Roddy which was probably the real star of this movie, just ask South Park (Cripple Fight!). C Visuals: Okay, this movie looked awesome. The special effects are a bit dated, but they more or less hold up to this day. The differences between the real world and the world seen through the glasses are awesome. John Carpenter is and will always be one of my favorite directors and this one was pretty good, although his love for long shots cost the scene of the cops beating up people in the back alley. That scene needed some creative editing and rapid cuts to make the hits look like they were actually impacting the victims. B Sound: Carpenter loves synthesizers, as shown by this movie, Prince of Darkness, and In the Mouth of Madness. In this one we get the blues as played through a synth, which makes for an eerie sound. No foleys kicked me out of the movie, so all around we're good. A Overall: This is a really stupid movie and I love it. It has become a bit hard to find these days, and if you consider yourself a fan or Carpenter and/or Evil Dead 2, then this movie is worth hunting down. I'd be willing to pay up to fifteen dollars for a good copy or a buck or two for a used VHS copy somewhere.

Set during the recession of 1986, it posits the source of the Yuppie scourge of the era. By now, few who may see this review have not seen the film, but for those few, I won't go into spoilers, but suffice it to say that anyone who loves conspiracy theories will recognize all of the elements: the ones at the top of the conspiracy, pulling the strings and all those who go along for convenience or reward or because they 'can't handle the truth.' And most of all, those few who see the truth and must fear for their lives as they try to fight apparently insurmountable odds in a society 'wired against them.' Heck, there's even a black helicopter. As with a conspiracy theorist's perception of the world, the American (and one presumes other countries') society of They Live is unable to see the strings, let alone the puppet masters. To the everyday worker, everything seems normal. Wealth and social/economic advancement are out of reach and the media give out subliminal messages designed to demotivate, produce calm obedience and distract. Some would compare They Live to the masterpiece 1984 in the way it predicts top-down manipulation of the working class and lower class by design.

It must be noticed during these years of intellectual poorness in american movies. It's not to say that there have been no clever movies but the most noticed movies were not. In France we keep overall movies like ""Rocky IV"" or ""Rambo"" where the hero is the stronger, he never dies and saves the world (what could we do without Americans ?). The point of view of Carpenter is very courageous, he shows what consumption society makes (consume, obey) and has that few people awares of it.

258,PhillipMichaelH,The film for the ages.,10,29 May 2011,"Released in November of 1988, director John Carpenter's They Live may be the film of its generation. Well, if it's not then it's pretty close. John Carpenter is mostly known for the box office smash hit Halloween (1978) and as great as that film is (it's my favorite film), They Live is proof that the horror master had more to offer, along with a lot of other gems like Escape From New York (1981), The Thing (1982), Big Trouble In Little China (1986), In The Mouth Of Madness (1995), Escape From L.A. (1996) and Vampires (1998), They Live ranks on the list of his best films. Carpenter's films usually suffer from low production values and above average performances from his actors but when you look past that, his films really are very deep and well made and this film is no exception. What makes Carpenter so unique is that he really understood where Hollywood was heading during the late 70s and most of the 80s and for a short period of time he got his taste of Hollywood. He then realized that it simply only cares about making money and he spent the rest of his career as a true independent, not following any rules and making movies the way that he wanted to.Carpenter was riding on the success of Halloween, which was in its day the highest grossing independent film ever made. Escape From New York was another hit movie and by this time he was getting major studio offerings. He then directed his first big studio picture The Thing. This film was expected to be a commercial hit but unfortunately, the film was a disaster and was even considered one of the most hated films by critics and audiences alike. Although The Thing has found a cult audience over the years, it was the film that launched a series of commercial failures from the director.Carpenter was feeling angry and frustrated with the way the studio system was heading so he decided to make a film that expressed this anger which is where They Live comes in. This film may be one of the bravest movies in its day. During the 1980s, we were being told to do nothing but consume. This film is a study of the world being corrupt by the media and how it tells us to simply not care and just make tons of money. The middle class are portrayed as villains in the film and that being rich and successful is the only way to be happy while poor working class people are being treated as useless. We all believe that fame and fortune is what makes us somebody but Carpenter wasn't about to become a sell out and instead he dealt with his anger by making this film and when you look at it now you can't help but think what an honest direction that was to go in.But this movie isn't just for deep thinkers, it is also a kick ass sci-fi action movie and it's a lot of fun too. Sure, the movie is goofy at times and very B movie material but to me that's a positive aspect, I think that was the perfect way to portray the story. I would put this movie up there with A Clockwork Orange (1971) even, as pretentious as that sounds.",They Live

If you watching movies for visual effect just roll over and skip this. If you love mysteries and cool story line, this is your movie. I can tell you every little moment is a about our past, present and future societies, and the fact people can't obey forever.I read couple of review thy actually tell a lot of point, but what i can see most relevant in our current status is the manipulation of the media (fake news), and the potential dystopia, if we ignore personal freedom, and doing this via manipulation of mass media. Eventually one of the most symbolic moment when a long fight executed (how hard to awaken sleeping friend)... I was missing the final resolution and cathartic moment humanity won or whatever, but this is not really matter. This movie make people think and read between lines. Great production even is the budget and quality is not so high. There are couple of dystopian movies, which received much more attention, I found this movie so late and wondering why eg Hunger games got much more hype than this production. At that era it was common to utilize aliens as bad, but c'omon the evil is within humanity always, aliens are just symbolic here. And finally this movie utilize some very good humor, which is just some added extra. I agree with the negative side explained in the comments buildup slow, music poor, casting and visual are also limited, but I still give 10 to balance the negative feedback....

Surprising is Roddy Piper was really good for a guy who was a former pro wrestler. Davied Keith was excellent as well, he is such an underrated actor. The two played the ""buddy"" duo very well. Piper and Keith's 5 minute fight scene is epic alone. I also love the soundtrack, it's very edgy.

The story offers curiosity at the start, then as soon as you've caught the scent, the pace picks up and you are swiftly bounced through towards the end at a satisfying pace which gives you enough time to soak up key parts of the story but not enough time for it to go stagnant.If you're a fan of eighties action films and even pure science fiction films then I would highly recommend this as it delivers on so many levels.",They Live

The draggy end is inevitable as the movie's core message was delivered during Nada's first walk down the street with the glasses on. The rest of the movie is anticlimactic. A pretty good job by Roddy Piper. The technical aspects and various merits of this film have been explored by others. I mostly wanted to point out that on 1/31/2006, the Sci-Fi channel aired this classic directly opposite George Bush's state of the union address!

266,djelvis2,If you don't have time to watch the entire Matrix trilogy...(DOULBLE SPOILERS),6,28 November 2003,"Sure, it's a really, really CHEAP version.  ""The Matrix"" is the pinnacle of millenial cinematic technology, casting some of the world's most recognizable stars.  ""They Live"" looks like it was filmed for television circa 1982, and its stars are a professional wrestler and a dude who used to live in Mr Rogers Neighborhood -- in the land of make-believe.  But if you've ever dug Chuck Norris movies, or anything with ""Kickboxing"" in the title, ""They Live"" will feel like a freakin' treatise.Honestly, the parallels are there.  Is Roddy Piper's character, Nada, any more reticent and mysterious than Keanu Reeves' Neo?  If anything, Nada seems more charming, and definitely more human.  There's the mysterious glimpses and glitches into a world that exists among our world, akin to the parable of Plato's cave; a scrappy but armed underground contingent whose ultimate goal is to return awareness to the human race; a malevolent alien force that sates mankind into complacency while it uses humanity for its nourishment; the sublimination, the betrayals, the humor amid the chaos...For me, 80's B-grade action is a genre, like French comedies and Woody Allen films;  in this context, ""They Live"" is a capable film, though not strong enough to transcend its conventions.  It's a working class action film, with the catchy bon mots and gratuitous explosions that you crave from these films.I can think of two distinct advantages that ""They Live"" has over ""The Matrix"": -the alley fight between Nada and Frank is a more powerful struggle for me than all the wire work of all 3 Matrix films. -""They Live"" only took an hour and a half of my life.  rating: 6/10",They Live
267,mrdestroyer2001,Total absurdity,5,26 April 2019,"Removing several memorable projects, among which is known to many horror-lovers, the tape ""Halloween"", which allowed the genre to emerge as a slasher, John Carpenter created the film ""They Live"". And it is hard to believe that this creation belongs to him. We have to admit that making a movie about aliens who shop in stores that manage people and, at the same time, quietly living among them - the idea is no longer so original.At the beginning of the film, John Nada (Roddy Piper) appears before us - not a very successful man who came to Los Angeles and was looking for work along the way. Once on the construction site as a worker, he meets Frank, who offers him the opportunity to settle at the church, in a small refuge where homeless people and people with a difficult fate live. Here, John meets Gilbert and, in the course of strange circumstances, he learns the terrible truth about how the world works. Finding amazing sunglasses, and wearing them, he sees the newcomers, who seem to be and should not be among ordinary people. In addition to this, he sees on billboards that look perfectly normal for mere mortals, calls: ""Multiply"", ""Make purchases"", ""Submit"", ""Consume"" and so on. But the truth turns out to be harsh and, having walked along a street with glasses on, John manages to become a criminal for potential invaders, capable of bringing their secret society and all those who enter it into clear water. Behind him begins the hunt.It would not be an exaggeration to say that the film is ruined by the development of events that has been prolonged and unhurried in many moments, and the actions of the protagonist are sometimes incomprehensible. In particular, the phrases he utters are designed to make the viewer laugh, but, as a result, what he heard only spoils the atmosphere with each passing minute more and more. In general, the dialogues between John and one of the people turned out to be stupid, and sometimes not very relevant to a particular situation. The game of actors, too, does not please anything good. Rodie Piper creates so without an emotional and cardboard character that there is absolutely no desire to look at his game. For the same emotion, not descending from his face, almost throughout the story, you get tired to watch. The same situation with actress Meg Foster. Only the expansive Frank - the role inherited by Kit David, though I remember something. And the prolonged fight between Frank and John turned out to be very natural.Large-scale scenes, with dozens of people involved in them and the destruction of the very settlement near the church, turned out to be very faded and unpretentious in terms of the quality of the production. And why was it necessary to make the faces of ""strangers"" exactly as we saw them in the film? The first thing that comes to mind is the zombie. Although, if we take into account that aliens are remotely similar to reptiles, which, as is commonly believed in our world, are involved in how and in what conditions we live, in this case there is nothing special to find fault with. I admit that my paranoia and my patient, who formed after reading strange literature, admitting all sorts of theories to seize the world, and the mind that later became sick, played a role here. And in general, how can you criticize the fruit of someone's imagination.It is hard to imagine what the director lacked to make a much better project than what already exists. Due to the presence of stupid dialogues and absurd, in many scenes, actions by the characters, the film ""They Live"", even though it was an interesting, but unfortunately, badly realized idea, turned out to be frankly bad.",They Live

269,rhyatt1,The best movie sci-fi movie ever made starring a WWF wrestler,10,2 November 2009,"I will begin by saying this movie is awesome. I will continue by saying this movie isn't awesome. To try to make sense of all this you should read the review.First of all this movie stars Rowdy Roddy Piper. I don't know if it's worse if you do or don't know who that is, but Rowdy Roddy Piper was a WWF wrestler in the era of Hulk Hogan back when there was still national debate about whether or not wrestling was fake. To imagine we used to live in a time where tards seriously believed wrestling was real is hard to believe, but those were simpler times when a black man entering a wrestling ring with a parrot on his shoulder while calling himself cocoa beware made sense.The movie is a little goofy, but still is somehow considered to be somewhat of an underground classic. The plot is the world is being controlled by aliens who look like normal humans unless you see them while wearing special sunglasses. Not a bad idea, but not a good idea either. Just an idea. The only purpose in being able to see who's an alien is for the sake of the movie. Seeing that the guy next to you buying the paper is an alien is pointless unless you take it upon yourself to murder his alien ass. Luckily Rowdy Roddy is the one person willing to do just that.The beginning of the movie is pretty slow and boring and mainly involves Piper removing his flannel shirt to do construction jobs and then going to live in a homeless shantytown. Since a movie about a homeless construction worker doing actual construction work would be terrible, rowdy roddy eventually discovers a church where rebels are making the special sunglasses.After putting on the sunglasses Roddy sees that some people appear to have alien faces when he's wearing them. And although nobody has actually explained to him what it even means to see random aliens while wearing sunglasses, within 10 minutes of first putting on the glasses he's already killing two cops who appear to have alien faces.Naturally Roddy has a hard time convincing others of this alien scheme he's discovered/imagined, but he makes a very memorable effort to when he meets his friend Frank the next day in an alley. Roddy tries to put the sunglasses on Frank's face to make him see the truth, but Frank simply refuses to wear them. What takes place as a result is by far the most ridiculous and awesome fight in movie history. In a fight that just won't end Roddy and Frank beat each other for what seems like an eternity. The fight is so ridiculous and over the top that it inspired an entire episode of southpark where jimmy and timmy beat each other in an alley in the same way.Eventually Frank puts on the glasses and realizes Roddy was right and the rest of the movie is about Frank and Roddy fighting the aliens. They go the the alien headquarters via the use of some sort of star trek beaming device and proceed to murder everyone there whether they are alien guards, alien office workers, or humans.All of this murder is great and necessary to keep you from give up on watching the movie, but the act of stopping the aliens is basically pointless. There's a vague explanation saying the aliens came to this planet to ""use it's resources"", but that doesn't even make sense when you put it in the context of this movie. The dirty aliens technically use our resources through normal living just like we do, but they're not using them at an alarming rate or anything. So rather than being diabolical they're really just being a-holes by not sharing any of their alien technology with us. In summary this movie may deserve its underground cult status or it may be a pile of garbage. Which side of the fence you land on regarding that depends on how much you love wrestling and aliens. If you love aliens actually wrestling then you'll be disappointed for sure. If you would love to wrestle an alien yourself then you should spend more time finding a way to make contact with aliens and less time watching movies.",They Live

Im 37 years old, I've never seen this film for some reason but I guess it makes sense why.On the positive aspect I feel John Carpenter was onto something with the social sheep that has been created within this society over the 90s and 2000s.But this is labeled as a sci fi film. You can fast forward to 31min in and just start the film as there is nothing of importance in that period. You dont gain any feelings for the character as they describe who he is. Than the sci fi starts to begin and social conscious ideas. But than.. there's 2 fight scenes all about him trying to have another put on a pair of glasses? Are we supposed to think John Carpenter feels women and black men are ignorant that they would fight someone, like literally fight for 10min or almost cause a death to another just because they refuse to put on a pair of sunglasses??Im 61min into this film as I write this review, 2/3 of the way and what really has occurred?

272,robobalboa,"Hey, what's wrong, baby?",8,16 October 2021,"One good thing about dystopian sci-fi films that center on class warfare is that they never lose their relevancy.Carpenter, like Verhoven with Robocop, does a really great job of satirizing and exposing the shallowness of the Regan 80's through the use television. Both films have just uproarious talking-heads and commercials that everyone watches passively. I'm not saying times have changed, but at certain point the ""are we so different today"" point just becomes depressing.It's kind of amazing that until the very end, there really doesn't seem to be any sets, and along with using actors that, outside of Keith David, are relying on their rawness instead of skill, it gives the film a visceral vérité quality that captures more than just the text of the film.Great movie.

273,Ianmcane,"Decent Concept, Terrible Execution",3,10 July 2021,"A lot of the gushing reviews of this film seem to concentrate almost entirely on 'its message and its relevance'. Ok, the core concept - a homeless man finds a pair of sunglasses which allow him to see an alien species living amongst us and sending out subliminal messages to control us - is reasonably intriguing, if not exactly spectacularly original. I can imagine how this may of been better received in the Reagan-era 1980s however the idea of an elite class using the media to condition and control the masses hardly makes for groundbreaking stuff reviewing this here in 2021.Aside from that, pretty much everything else about this B-movie sci-fi actioner is dismal. The characters are flat, the acting is wooden, the direction is all over the place and the dialogue is bizarre and only funny in an ""Oh my God this is so bad"" sort of way. If this was genuinely supposed to be an attempt at satire then John Carpenter fell flat on his face. Good satire is delivered with a knowing wink which both the filmmakers and the audience are aware of and can share the joke. I was just confused most of the time watching this film. My partner actually said out loud ""What the Hell is going on?!!"" during the fight scene between Rod Piper and Keith David. Why did it last so long? Why was it so excessively violent? Why did both men walk away practically unscathed when in reality they'd both be in hospital afterwards? Ok I know it's an 80s action scene but come on, even the various Arnie vehicles of the 1980s were more believable than this and that's saying something!I give this 3 out of 10, purely because I'm sure worse films exist, I rate Keith David as an actor and he was the only talent in this, and as I said the core concept is reasonably interesting. I seriously wouldn't waste your time on this though unless you have a fetish for really bad cult films.",They Live

And since I was a fan of Carpenter, I was happy to be the first in line at the ticket booth when this film opened in my home-town. But I went thinking THEY LIVE was going to be a horror film. I was very disappointed when I first caught sight of the aliens and wanted to leave the theater, but since I had purchased my $3.50 ticket, and my $5.00 tub of buttered popcorn (and also I noticed Keith David, one of my favorite actors co-starring in it) I decided to sit through it.All disappointment left when Keith finally teamed up with Piper to combat those butt-ugly aliens. The action was almost non-stop from that point till the very end. And I left the theater amazed at Roddy Piper's (a pro wrestler) acting skills. I don't know if he had ever acted before, but he seemed like a darn good natural. Keith David's great acting skills came as no surprise to me since I was already a fan of his work in John Carpenters re-make masterpiece ""THE THING"" (I'd gone to see this at the theaters as well).

280,rosti_mitev,They live .... we ....?,9,18 September 2004,"An interesting movie, by the well-known director Carpenter. The movie looks like a sci-fi thriller, but it is more of a satira or ironical look at the modern society! Now, in 2004, I realize how much truth holds the movie. The constant subconscious suggestion from TV commercials, billboards, radio stations from the movie ... is happening now! In the real world. The greed (""This is your God""), the vanity, the hypocrisy are taking over the world. The modern societies are becoming a mere mass of mindless zombies, led by the common trends, by stereotypes, by suggested ideals. The movie is more of a warning of what could happen if we loose our humanity!Sadly, I think that all is as in the movie, only that the evil aliens are actually evil human beings, turned into monsters, by our natural demerits.",They Live

282,KiltsMcGee,Messages buried in cheese.,8,17 May 2015,"Prior to watching this film, the only John Carpenter film I had seen was Big Trouble in Little China. Needless to say, after that experience, I found it very difficult to take They Live seriously. It provides only a fraction of the absurdity of Big Trouble but makes up for it in anti-consumerism undertones. Professional wrestler, 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper stars as George Nada, a surprisingly well-muscled homeless man struggling to even find work in construction sites. He finds himself suspicious of a church near to his landfill site of habitation. He meddles about in matters and ends up lost in a rigmarole of oddly believable ridiculousness. The undoubted best aspect of the film is the incisive allegorical anti-consumerism. There are hugely overt references to how false the American dream is and how media is effectively brainwashing consumers. The theme's presence is apparent and definitely the focal point of the film but it doesn't detract from the action of the film. It would be difficult to make any political statement this large in a film that isn't a documentary, which is the impressive part of the film. It affected my standpoint on the matter as much as a Michael Moore film.The action in the film is odd and rather jarring. In act three, gunshots are quickly followed by a close-up of the jittering barrel of the gun that is shooting every single time. This happens many times and never failed to shove me right out of the film so that I could look away to avoid a splitting headache. Even still, the act three shots are majorly long takes and visually arresting. Having Roddy Piper as the leading actor, you would expect more suplexes and clotheslines than actually appear. The extent of his fighting is him forcing sunglasses onto a guy's face (which is admittedly hilarious).I don't want to spoil a large aspect of the film, (an aspect that most people already know) so I will merely say that the production value and make-up in the film is very impressive, something that Carpenter has become known for after The Thing.They Live is the quintessential mix between political statement and cheesy 80s action film. The statement is expertly integrated and was personally, very successful. The action is a true mixed bag featuring great long takes but needless flurries of cuts. However it features a great use of production and make-up. Definitely worth your time.",They Live
283,qdude440,Z Grade becomes A Grade,9,22 August 2005,"They Live is John Carpenter's tribute to cheesy 50's sci-fi movies, combining the sci-fi with a feel of grit and action, as well as some interesting social commentary that goes as far to talk about how the Reagen Administration propagates rampant consumerism and brainwashes the public so easily. Its an unlikely place to find such messages, but like the magazines with CONSUME written on the 'inside', seen only with special glasses, They Live conceals its true core and gives audiences a bit of everything, transforming the film into something of a hidden message keeper itself. .Nada {Piper}, is a wandering man with no particular place to go, representing blue collar America in Carpenter's tale. After arriving at an outdoor homeless shelter, he soon begins to suspect something strange is going on, especially after a brutal police raid. By accident, he discovers some plastic sunglasses, that show a whole 'nother side to the world. Piper sums it up best with the line, 'You see, I take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person doesn't she huh? Put e'm back on: formaldehyde face!'.After discovering the secret hidden alien world, Nada first attempts going rampant, then thinks better of it. After a classically overdone fight scene, Nada teams up with Frank {David} and joins a group of people who are attempting to overthrow the domineering aliens. Underneath, their battle represents the minority's struggle against the big bad American government, but on the outside, its just a noisy, fun alien adventure. There is a plot hole or two, some bad alien makeup, and a few cheesy scenes, but its hard not to like this film as an action/sci-fi adventure, and its hard not to appreciate the layers of commentary Carpenter manages to cleverly conceal here. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but it should be recommended to any action, sci-fi, or Carpenter fans for the underrated 'hell of an adventure' film this is.9/10",They Live

All the rest of it in front and in the back is just a very badly made story full of gaping plot holes and a very unoriginal message, even for that time. I had expectations of at least an amusing movie form people saying that this movie was so clever and deep. But the story felt like a severe insult to my intelligence. The main character is a total Gary Sue. He is the only one to spot out the obvious things that are supposed to be hidden from every one else and he is everywhere at the exact right time for important things to happen and everybody just knows how important he is the moment they see him. Also there is a quite pointless and unsympathetic fight scene that lasted for half an hour with the ""very deep and educational"" message that you are allowed to bully people to make them see things your way.",They Live
290,deckard_78,Ahead of it's time Carpenter classic.Just amazing!,10,15 July 2006,"From John Carpenter,here comes one of the greatest sci-fi/action movies ever made that you'll never forget.They Live is a cult classic and without no doubt,one of the best movies of Carpenter.The movie's about a drifter named Nada accidentally makes a horrible discovery while looking for a job;the earth is ruled by aliens and the only way to see their origins hidden behind fake human faces is to wear a special pair of sunglasses.Seems that they deliver hidden messages like 'obey','no independent thought' and 'watch t.v.'to control human's minds and to keep them away from a possible mutiny against them.Soon,Nada finds out there is a small group aware of the danger on humanity and make those special sunglasses.He joins that small group with his new sidekick Frank and they begin trying to find a way for a worldwide wake up call for humans.However,they don't fight only against the aliens,they also fight against humans who are aware of the alien invasion but seduced by money,status,a much better life standard and now cooperate with the aliens.While using his unique way of storytelling to keep the tension high,Carpenter also reminds us human beings are far from perfection.He says we;humans are selfish creatures and we could do anything for our unlimited desires;whatever it takes!Besides the message it's carrying,They Live is a typical Carpenter movie.It's a low budget masterpiece with humor,great one liners,a classic Carpenter score with Roddy Piper in the lead.He's just outstanding as the lone drifter Nada.The cast includes Keith David,very underrated Meg Foster with some Carpenter regulars like Peter Jason and George 'Buck' Flower and they all give solid performances.Also there is an unforgettable fight sequence between Piper and David that lasts nearly ten minutes which is almost as famous as the movie itself.A unique movie from a master.",They Live

Rody Piper and Meg Foster are terrible. There are so many reaction shots of Piper where he puts on a thousand-yard stare. Thank god for Keith David! If not for him I don't think I could finish the movie.There is one piece of the flattest, dullest ""blues"" music that just keeps playing over and over and over again. It changes slightly here and there but it seriously feels like 50% of the film is set to the same eight bars of music.The heroes win by being totally impervious to gunfire, accept the one time they get shot and die, because otherwise there wouldn't be a conclusion to the story, I guess. So much of the movie is the heroes running down hallways and shooting frantically at the bad guys while the bad guys spray them back and hit nothing. Piper's character just seems to stumble from scene to scene. He literally falls through a hole to find the alien's lair. He never comes up with a plan other than, ""run and shoot the aliens."" No explanation is given for how his character obtained his action star abilities.Plot holes:The aliens recruit a homeless man to be one the co-conspirators in their regime. This is after we see the aliens tear down an entire shanty town of homeless people. What the aliens get out of having this homeless person as an ally, I have no idea. This character's return not only is a plot hole, it totally goes against the themes and spirit of the film.The protagonist succeeds by shooting the alien's broadcasting dish. The one dish they have that they use to control all of the people's perceptions in LA. There's no backup plan if, for whatever reason, the aliens loose their one dish.

The Beginning starts off very strong and humorous, the middle does slow slightly with a silly sub-plot but does have a very funny and cool 7 minute fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David. The ending is short but gives you plenty of room to make up your own thoughts. A very original premise and a very original and fun movie that are underrated and have been copied many times over the years.

It is because it is a blend of sci-fi and horror with firm yet amusing critics to the society. I have always loved Carpenter's vision of reality, it is stunning to think that, after 24 years this film was shot, many things match...Personally, I loved the way this title describes the degradation of the system and the efforts that are constantly made by the "" ruling coalition "" of this world to keep things running and make people do what's good for them! There are only a few things I do not like about this movie, but it's something not that important. In some scenes ( the fighting one between Nada and Franks is way too long ) the rhythm is not very active with the result of getting a little bit boring. There are also funny scenes such as the one in which Nada gets inside a bank by mistake and starts shooting everyone as he noticed that most of the clients were aliens.

WWF star Piper is actually not bad in the lead as the working man turned soldier who is awakened to the horror of the American dream through special sunglasses.

298,joepublic,Piper's Pit x 10000,9,14 March 2006,"They Live came at a strange time for John Carpenter. The commercial misfire of Big Trouble In Little China and the back to basics Prince Of Darkness left him looking for a new project. They Live was the outgrowth of a low budget, around $4 million, and a pre-existing love for B-movies. Carpenter's love of B-movies is well noted, not least by his direct re-workings of The Thing and Village Of The Damned . They Live profits from his obvious passion.L.A. the near future, John Nada (Roddy Piper) is a working class labourer that comes to town to find the work that has eluded him around the country. He discovers, via a pair of treated sun-glasses produced by an underground rebel force, that humans and the planet earth are being exploited by aliens that hold all seats of Political and social power. One of the movies best features is the visual differentiation from the everyday world and the alien reality. Shown in black and white point of view shots of Piper's character the underlying messages in advertising, newspapers and even money are strikingly exposed in black lettering. The most impressive element of this visual style is that many of the black and white POV shots are matte paintings.Another of the real strengths of the movie, surprisingly perhaps, is Piper's turn as Nada. He is never short of convincing whether he is portraying the fear of the situation he finds himself in or spitting one liners as he blows away aliens. He has said that his own experience of homelessness helped him create Nada. His performance is supported in the best possible way by the always watchable Keith David as Frank, Nada's labourer friend who he turns to for help. Meg Foster's performance as Holly Thompson is less impressive but not all the blame can be put on her as her role as Nada's captive, then love interest isn't well written or substantial. Her character moves the plot forward but does little to add to it.The action is acceptable and typical in its 80s style, lots of gun fire and bodies, but that and the uneven tone, from social satire to lines like ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubblegum"" (a Piper ad-lib), work against what is an interesting and somewhat rare, anti-Reagan '80s action movie. While the film may have been improved by a slightly more serious tone the lighter elements do hold some pleasures. The near ten minute fight scene in which Nada tries to convince Frank to put on the glasses and see what is going on is hilarious, just when you think it is over they get down to more scrapping. It puts you in mind of The Fast Show sketch The Longest Fight and is just as amusing. The last shot of the movies also has to be seen to be believed but I'll let you find that out for yourself.Guilty pleasure or not, it doesn't really matter as many have discovered They Live ranks amongst Carpenter's best movies.An interesting sideline, the commentary track on the DVD release is excellent and includes the director and Roddy Piper whose stories about the filming of the movie and his position in the world of professional wrestling at the time are fascinating.

He is living a time in the USA where employment was not adequate.

Soon Nada discovers that a nearby church is a front for a mysterious rebel group which possess motives of unknown nature. When the shantytown and the rebel front is bombarded and destroyed by police, Nada finds something that the insurgent group was stockpiling – rad 80's sunglasses. These sunglasses, however, hold much darker secrets – they allow the wearer the see the world as it truly is – full of subliminal advertising aimed at controlling humans, and all at the hand of aliens living among us! A paranoid Nada is now on an unstoppable path for answers: he's here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and unfortunately for the ghoul-like aliens, he's all out of bubblegum. No-one does 80's style B-movie classics quite like John Carpenter. A Sorry I'm Late.com favourite, Carpenter here, as always, has a message to deliver – this one about corruption, commercialism and 80's style excess. His throwbacks to 1950's paranoia themed movies, such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers, are evident - even down to the out-and- out cheesy special effects (Go, flying saucer, go!). Sublimely slow paced and low-key, They Live is probably Carpenter's most intelligently written observation of the times (still relevant, perhaps?), but don't let that fool you – this movie has enough silly B-movie shenanigans to make a truly entertaining feature. What may said shenanigans be, you ask? Well... One liner's? Hell yeah. Killer, low budget action set pieces? Umm, yup. Piper giving the finger to the aliens in one final act of defiance? It's right here. And the final coup de grace of awesome, when Nada's only ally (perennial bad-ass Keith David) won't wear the sunglasses, what happens? A five and a half minute fistfight, that's what. Awesome. Definitely a moment of filmic significance, even parodied on South Park's Cripple Fight episode, blow for blow. Plucked straight from the squared-circle of the then WWF, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper gives an amazing performance. He looks like a guy that has been through a lot, and really underplays the paranoia and disbelief for a while. That is, until he hits a moment where the character seems to snap and he's on a mission for answers and he'll take everyone with him. Performing in front of thousands of people in a wrestling ring was great practice for when Nada snaps, because when Piper hams it up, he hams it up with force. It's just a shame Hollywood never caught on to Piper, because he plays cheesey-80's-rugged action-hero very well. But it's not perfect. The film's slow burn dies in the final act as a jarringly fast series events speed towards the conclusion. And as with many Carpenter flicks, his ideas are larger than his available palette of tools to work with, and although that's what many, myself included, find charming about his films, audiences nowadays are spoiled with even the lamest trash getting decent budgets.

Carpenter has never needed much prodding to take such positions and it was the rage during the Reagan administration and the yuppie era to blame free market capitalism for creating the poverty and dysfunction of the lower strata; never, never bring up the subject of intelligence or work ethic. It's an old Marxist tome that people making big money through capitalism creates poverty, yet it doesn't seem to dissuade those in Hollywood from enjoying all the fruits of a capitalist society to the levels of a Caligula Saturday night without any feeling of hypocrisy.",They Live

309,nnpietro,Reptillian Shapeshifters! Oh snap!,8,3 September 2013,"Synopsis:I know John Carpenter through his film Halloween (1978) which has become an American Movie Classic. Having heard about Carpenter's other works I had just never found the time to see another until recently.They Live is a story about a 'nameless' man who becomes aware of the world he lives in through the most unusual circumstances. And this world is much different than what you and I are familiar with. Upon this discovery, he becomes driven to exploit this 'other world' to the rest of the sheep out there. Filled with suspense, action, and quirky humor, this film has put me on a Carpenter binge.Review:If you're a conspiracy theorist, this film will blow you away. One reason this is true is because how the 'uncovering' is played out. It seems that the enlightenment that our nameless character experiences is much like the creepy terms ""sooner than you think"" and ""before you know it"" in which the events you just discovered have already tread an almost irreversible path. In addition, there are always a million people who just aren't going to believe a word you're saying. And this aspect is evident during a pretty gnarly fight sequence.The humor of this film is awesome. Our nameless character is a buff-all- American tough guy who makes parody of the Stallone and Schwarzenegger personas giving a clear idea of the tone Carpenter possesses in regards to those types of action figures. With cheap cliché idioms and catchphrases Carpenter owns this aspect of the film creating a character whose comic appeal turns out being more badass than Stallone or Schwarzenegger.Many have complained about the special effects of this film giving it a poor review. I might contend that the special effects, although cheap, in fact ADD to the strange and bizarre nature of the world that our nameless character uncovers.Obey my command and see this film. Do not question it.",They Live

311,thefiddle,Carpenter's B-movie Masterpiece!,9,19 November 2006,"John Carpenter had said that They Live had been the best film he had ever made, considering he also made Halloween, Escape From New York, and The Thing remake (arguably one of the scariest films and one of my favorite horror movies). To call this movie his best film is really interesting on my part because I can see where he is coming from with it. It's bad in the best possible way.The film stars WWF Wrestling legend Roddy Rowdy Piper as the lead hero who discovers a pair of sunglasses that reveal to him that the world has in fact been taken over by an imperialist alien race who has turned earth into a capitalist, decadent hell. However, in sociological context, take away the aliens, and earth already looks that way. The film is interesting because it was made around that transition period between the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s, so there's some competing trends and ideologies here.The first time I saw They Live, I remember flipping through the channels and finding it on the Space Channel. It was already half-way into it and I saw Piper wandering around aimlessly on the streets of New York, seeing the aliens all around him through cheesy black and white POV shots, and I kept asking myself, ""What the hell is this?"" It seemed really surreal, almost like the world around Piper had become a B-movie. Then Piper opens his mouth with a barrage of bad one-lines (the famous ""I am hear to chew bubble gum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubble gum) and I knew exactly what I was seeing. It was different, though. I had never seen a B-movie with a brain, a social-conscience, and a self-reflexive sense of humor before. Usually you only get one of those things and it's generally not the first two.The beauty of They Live is that it is a B-movie, but it's a high-budget B-movie paying a loving homaging to the genre. It's one for the fans. It has the premise and the look of a B-movie. (Comparitively speaking to Carpenter's other works, the photography for this film is ugly as hell.) Carpenter is embracing the B-movie status of this film and using his talents/intelligence as a gifted director to make it that much more of a B-movie. Everyone involved in the film seems to know that except Piper, which makes the film even more enjoyable. His heroic crusades in the movie appear more like a madman on a killing spree - a direct jab at the whole 80s action hero trend. As a side note, Carpenter took this idea from the Italian Pablum films of the 50s and 60s, where Hercules went on fantastical and mystical adventures, but everyone in the audience watched him for how much of an idiot he was. There's a point in the film where so hobos are watching the original Hercules film starring Steve Reeves on a junky old television set.I won't spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen this masterpiece, but there is a fight scene in the film that makes the entire thing worth seeing. It's so absurd and so ridiculously long that it made in the series ""Top Ten Movie Fights."" If you watch this movie for anything, watch it for that. It is so great.",They Live
312,digobragaro,Brilliant criticism with horrible execution.,6,24 March 2017,"Yes. It's horrible. The acting is horrible, makeup is... weird, and the props, the action are all terrible. If you wanna see a good movie, then this is not that. This is really poorly executed, and lacks any commitment. It seems like a ""gig"" to everyone involved. BUT, if in other hand, you don't mind a flaky production for a good idea, then it's a pretty good movie. I like to judge books, movies, music in three different areas: production, capacity to surface ideas and overall use of the language. Whilst this fails miserably with both the first and the last, it excels on the second area. It will (potentially) make you revisit a lot of your pre conceived thoughts.

313,pooh-31,Sticks it to the Reagan era,10,13 August 1999,"Spoiler alert: the following comment reveals a key plot point.Growing up in the Reagan era, I often thought my values made me an alien among my own people.  This movie reverses that scenario, by making the hero the human among the aliens, but the point is the same.  The values of the soul-less money grubbing eighties were at their base anti-human, cold, reptilian.  Carpenter's images of the skeletal alien changelings with their blow dried 80s dos make the perfect symbol of the times, therefore.Carpenter has never been a high brow movie maker but rather a craftsman, skilled in the techniques of horror and sci fi, so the ""message"" of They Live results a little bit in Carpenter's grasp exceeding his reach, but that's okay.  The humor of the movie and the chemistry especially between Piper and David make it entertaining enough to be more than worth 90 minutes of your time and the price of a video rental.  Classic line ""I have come to chew bubble gum and to kick ass; and I'm alllll outta bubble gum"" is practically worth the price of admission right there.One complaint is Carpenters do-it-yourself score which consists of a looped blues riff played over and ovvvverrrr to the point that it gets a bit annoying.",They Live

Well, to avoid laughing hysterically, let me just say I was a bit off.  Okay, I'm laughing hysterically anyway. While not as bad as something like ""Hell Comes to Frogtown"", it is in the same league (if that is possible).  The sunglasses are a cool idea, and the premise of the film is actually kinda cool (if cliche), but the script, acting, direction, and effects are some of the worst in history, ruining any chance the movie may have had.  The script has more holes than I thought any movie (even Sci-Fi) could get away with, and it is not entertaining.  The acting is typical for a B-movie, noticeably awkward and silly.  The special effects are neither (to say the least).  As for the direction, I don't think there was any.  If there was a director I don't know what he was doing. The film is badly patched together from bad shots like some hideous Frankenstein's monster.  I know this movie has a gigantic following, but even after talking to several fans, I can't figure out why.  Go watch a 70's Sci-Fi movie with MUCH better effects, brilliant acting, and a beautiful script, like ""The Lathe of Heaven"" instead of a horrendous 80's B-movie.",They Live
317,mdonahoe,Its scary because it could be true,10,26 October 2004,"Well, let me start out by saying that this is one of the best sci-fi flicks of the past 20 years. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper(in his super big time debut) is a distraught construction worker who finds a mysterious pair of glasses. You might ask what do these glasses do, well I will tell you and Piper what they do, they can see aliens disguised as humans, thats what they do, ohhhhh. Well piper is very scared and confused when he finds this out, so he turns to his friend kieth David(his African-American co-worker)for some assistance, but he refuses to try the glasses on, even just for style. So this is where the best part of the movie happens, Piper doesn't like that he won't try them on, so a 62 minute fight scene ensues(keep in mind the movie is only 90 minutes long). You would think this would get boring but the fight is so good, you will be in awe the whole time and if you are a woman you will have to change undies. Finally Kieth tries on the glasses after much convincing and its up to Piper and a new crew of vagabonds to stop the treacherous aliens and find out their sinister plan before its too late.",They Live

Do yourself a favor and stay away from it, particularly if you happen to admire and respect (as I do) some of John Carpenter's others works, unless you've got a passionate crush for bad (and I mean real bad) movies. OK, the world is under the dominion of a dystopian alien shadow government of evil looking extraterrestrials infiltrating the society at all levels (though you can't see them unless you happen to wear specially crafted sunglasses), and this implausibility may sound and look good enough in any sci-fi movie, but even more implausible are the stupid things terrestrial rebels do at every step in order to fight back the ET scum. Characters are totally flat, very poorly acted, and the script just sucks, just so as the special effects do.

Like ""War of the Worlds"", this film deals with fending off the threat of an alien culture. Meg Foster's enticing eyes, that were not done justice in her earlier role as Evil Lynn, in the eerie, ""He Man and the Master's of the Universe"", (with Dolph Lundgren) would be worth the price of admission or any other media that this flick is available on. However, I might warn that the violence and gore in this film warrant parental guidance.The story imagines the hero discovering that aliens with jolly-roger skull like faces, live among the people of Earth, but who can only be seen by wearing a set of spectacles, known only to a secret group of people. As always, director John Carpenter has created a thrilling sci fi flick with a measure of action that mesmerises the viewer to the end. Don't miss it.",They Live

322,Tubular,"One of my favorite films, and definitely my favorite by Carpenter",10,22 September 2000,"First off, I have to admit, I'm a real Carpenter fan. But, whereas most people know him for his Horror movies, the first movies I think of when I think of John Carpenter is this one and ones like it. Like all of his early movies, the plot is very slow-moving and unfolds at a realistic pace. No shiny explosions or million-dollar special effects here. Only exactly what's needed to get the point across and no more. And to match the movies pace, the soundtrack is in the same repetitive, slow-moving, ambient mood as that from Precinct 13 or Dark Star. The plot is pretty clever. The idea being that we are all slaves of the aliens that have taken over the planet, and all the rich and the powerful either are aliens or have sold out to them. The thing that intrigues me most about this movie is the contrast between its slow moving plot and its genre, combatting an alien invasion. Often the subject of action computer games, this treatment of that plot idea actually only has a few fight scenes, and even they don't seem to rank up there with your standard action movies. Sure, there's guns blazing, but there's not much running around, dodging bullets. Most of the gun-fights look like something you'd see on the streets of LA more than an action movie. And I think that's the point. A paranoid-schizophrenic's view of the world. Taking the violence and hatred in the world and blaming it on, not just the aliens, but human nature's own tendency to follow them. Of course, this movie also has some of the best one-liners in movie history.",They Live

I love its cheesiness, its in-your-face posture, tongue-in-cheek immaturity. I love the characters, paper-thin and two dimensional as they come. But it's a classic, an 80's gem. It's a film that brings entertainment in spades and this is what makes me watch films.As for political and social commentary, there's a lot to say about that. But once again Hollywood is not the honest player. This came out in an era when America was doing quite well, economically and militarily. Hollywood pretends to serve revolution, but instead serves us ""Revolution(TM)"". The film is largely a class struggle metaphor, taking the inhumanity of the rich to the extreme that they are actually not human. This in an era during which there was more political stability than the US has known in quite a few years. But if this was an attempt at moral and cultural outrage... I just wish they would show their indignation without resorting to the corporate products. Seriously, ""consume"", ""this is your god"", ""sleep"", these ARE boilerplate Hollywood rhetorical at its core. Corporations using the products of corporations to attack corporations? Beware of consumerism? Hypocrisy doesn't even begin to describe it. Quite the rebels you guys are! I wonder if the producers really aimed at that level of ""social commentary"".It's a sickening cliché when films depict corporations as ""evil"": Weyland-Yutani, Tyrrel Corp, Umbrella, UAC, etc. Their purpose is to play gods and enslave mankind... I thought corporations depended on a good service to be profitable, so they can survive and not ""Oh my god, the corporations are coming, run for the hills!"" If anybody wants to protest against the corporate world, please don't do it writing on your PC or Apple Mac, while sitting in a Starbucks sipping a latte, and sending your posts through AT&T lines, onto YouTube or Google Servers, using Hitachi hard drives... the moral outrage gets lost somewhere along the corporate chain, don't you think?So, if like me you enjoyed this film, it's probably because you didn't take it very seriously.

Now it's up to Nada, and his newly accompanied friend Frank, to try to stop the aliens, and find out whats going on.Let me just say this. This is a criminally underrated film! It's funny, suspenseful, intelligent, and all around a great film. Roddy Piper gives a surprisingly good performance, and he's just perfect for the role. He's constantly spouting cheesy one liners, and kicking ass. He's just great.Definitely check this one out. Is it flawless? No, it has a lot of problems.

335,eric-1882,Read your Vance Packard,8,7 February 2015,"Other reviewers have pointed out the metaphor for Reaganism or the hippie thing. But it goes back long before either of those. Anyone who has read Vance Packard from the '50's (The Hidden Persuaders, and other great books)will immediately recognize the art of subliminal advertising which was in full swing long before Reagan or hippies. The big marketing companies have been using staff psychologists and test audiences since the '40's or even sooner, to find out what color to make the logo, what shape the box or bottle, which slogans turn on which age groups, where on the store shelf it should be displayed. That is, how to push our subconscious buttons to bypass any conscious reactions we may have to products. My favorite story is how an appliance manufacturer found sales on its new model refrigerator dropping. When they called in the shrinks, they traced the problem to a magazine and television ad that had the ""June Cleaver"" type housewife standing at the fridge holding the door open to show off the innards. People liked the look and features of the fridge. But deeper probing showed that people had a negative subconscious reaction to a housewife who was stupid and wasteful enough to stand there holding the door open, letting the cold out. They Live dumbs down the subliminal message just a little bit - ""Sleep"", ""Obey"", etc. But the technique is old and getting fine tuned all the time. The Koch Brothers and the other plutocrats love that liberals and conservatives fight over racism or religion in schools or a thousand other issues while they quietly rewrite the tax laws and make money from unnecessary wars. Misdirection, subconscious button pushing, and aiming below the conscious to hit the real decision making part of our brains - that's the lesson of They Live, and it far predates the 60's or the 80's. People respond to political or marketing polls with what they consciously think, then make a different choice when it comes down to it, based on those subconscious buttons that got pushed. I love They Live. I love Carpenter's use, also metaphorical, of the TV transmission, all staticky and spooky, trying to warn of the coming doom. He used the same device in his previous movie, the badly reviewed one with the devil as a tube of whirly green jello in the church basement. When you watch TV, especially the commercials, try to think about what they're trying to get you to do and which of your buttons they're pushing. The only defense against these manipulative ads (besides sheer poverty, can't afford to buy) is to understand the trick - what are they aiming for in you underneath the surface.

Based off of reviews and the cool concept, I presumed that this would be a better-than-average movie.The reality is that this is a good B-movie.The idea that aliens are controlling us and that the human race is sleeping itself into slavery is interesting but the way that the film was made detracts completely from that idea.Firstly, there is little/no character development.Secondly, the acting is this movie is beyond terrible.Thirdly, it's unrealistic, even in the context that aliens are in control of the Earth. Imagine this, a guy finds some sunglasses and when he wears them he sees aliens everywhere... within minutes he is shooting policemen and has transformed himself into some kind of pseudo superhero. It just doesn't make sense at all.So, you might think... well it's a movie about alien vision sunglasses, just sit back and enjoy the ride right?No!Trust me, I am not a pretentious movie guy.

It also has some really great cheesy one liners which I don't wish to spoil. Let it be known though, by the end of the movie you might just see a little of Ash from Evil Dead in Nada.

It reminds me of what is going on in Grants Pass, Oregon; I allege there is a secret scientific facility engaging in subliminal microwave weapons use and testing. The banquet scene is reminiscent of the People these ""manchurian"" scientists work for. The implants the so-called aliens possess could also be construed as analogous to the neck (vagus), spine (c-4), cerebral cortex, hippocampus and other microchips the scientists operating in Grants Pass place into unwitting and non-consensual Human Beings. When one resists the overtures of the ""banquet crowd"", the scientists under take a protocol of the destruction of mind, body and soul through the transmission of subliminal microwaves (produced in a hidden remote location) effectively destroying a Persons life. If only the ending scene of this film were to occur in Grants Pass.

Normally I'm a fan of John Carpenter, but this movie is really weak.  Slow, long, dull, with really stupid characters, Carpenter seems to know he's only got enough story to fill a 1/2 hour Twilight Zone episode...so he stretches every single scene to the maximum.  He can't show a guy walking up to a building, then cut to him inside; no, he has to slowly pan with him as he walks down the sidewalk and up to the door.  Then we cut inside and watch as he walks through the door and looks around...slowly.I guess if I saw this when I was 14 it would've been fun.  Good thing DVDs have fast-forward buttons.

There is for example a very long fight scene in the movie. There should be a fight scene there, but it is simply much too long and it thereby ruins the complete buildup of the film.For fans of the science fiction genre I would really advise you to see this movie.

The plot was superb (reminding me heavily of a 60's sci-fi film I saw but could never remember the title of where warring aliens had come to Earth to fight, assumed human guises and could only be seen through particular glasses). My biggest regret is that I never bought a copy of this before it hit the deleted list. Carpenter has produced (IMHO) some rubbish, but he has also produced some true gems, and this is one of them, along with Prince of Darkness, Vampires, Big Trouble in Little China, Escape from New York and Into the Mouth of Madness.

Second, he makes excellent social commentary on the 80's/Me(Reagan) era in the guise of upper-crust parasites as alien overlords. There are a few plot holes but it's great entertainment.Prior to Reagan we had no significant budget deficit, we may have had a recession during the Carter era, but that is nothing to the d**th-scape that King George is handing our kids today.

The characters could have been developed much more quickly and efficiently. Characters would disappear for so long, that I'd forget who they were when they reappeared back on screen. The ending was so abrupt and disappointing I actually asked ""Is that it?"" out loud. This movie should be categorized only as action, sci-fi, and comedy! Not horror. I wasn't scared once. I don't really have much more to say about this film other than I cannot believe the man behind Halloween, The Fog, and The Thing is responsible for this tripe!

360,nickcarmine,The Deep Impact and Interracial Misogynirstic Gayness of They Live,9,11 September 2011,"Based on a 1963 short story written by sci-fi writer Ray Nelson (lifelong friend of Phillip K. Dick, hung out with Satre, Simone De Beauvoir, all the beats), this 80's sci-fi thriller is John Carpenter's personal favorite and the best of his shaky ouvre. Although not a celebrated blockbuster, They Live impacted those who would be influential later on. It is the Velvet Underground of 80's action movies. Artist Shepard Fairey owes the film his career and still echoes its themes in his increasingly bland sloganeering. Fight Club discretely paid homage by stunt-casting Meatloaf.Is it possible to ascribe too much importance to this silly flick? Novelist Jonathan Lethem (Fortress of Solitude, Chronic City) recently devoted an entire slim book to the film. I don't know what Lethem says, but one thing is certain: They Live is gay.Piper plays Nada, who rolls into town, having allegedly left his wife behind to seek employment. He finds a job at a construction site, meets a black guy named Frank (the awesome Keith David), also free from the confines of traditional family. At break, Nada puts the scent out, sunning his pecs in tight jeans and waving his mullet. Frank bites. He takes Nada back to the homeless camp where he lives in a cooperative community and presumably has sex with him. The guys at man-camp sit around talking about repression.Nada goes to investigate the church next door and finds some odd, intriguing things. But his best find is a young dude who he rushes out of there and they presumably hook up, which causes a rift with Frank. Frank acts like a jealous ex for the rest of the movie.Nada also finds sunglasses that reveal the world has been taken over by nasty aliens. They're all yuppies, politicians and police. Billboard and magazine subliminals are revealed as pictures and text are replaced by stark commands floating in white space: Obey. Watch TV. Honor Apathy. This device is clearly based on the work of artist Barbara Kruger, who used the same font to subvert stock consumerist images throughout the 1980's.The awful scenario of a schizophrenic with a gun is evoked when Nada wanders into a bank with a shotgun and delivers that nutty line: It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I'm all out of bubble gum! Then starts killing people / aliens.Nada carjacks a woman who embodies all women in the movie's world. She's beautiful, but blank, zoned out to a state where she cannot emotionally engage with life, completely undesirable to our gay hero. Her presence almost puts him to sleep at her condo. Finally, she realizes w/ disappointment that Nada will not try to rape her, smashes a champagne bottle over his head, and shoves him out the window. Then she calls police, explains what happened, and languidly says: Yes, I'll hold.Nada makes his way back to Frank to show him the sunglasses. But Frank has quit Nada. He's had it with him, obviously still angry about Nada's liaison with the young dude.So begins the absurdly long and sexual back alley wrestling sequence, culminating with furious man to man dry humping. Frank finally succumbs and wears the glasses. Both men are spent. They go to a seedy motel with an air of illicit purpose. The door shuts, they lock eyes. Nada ruefully inquires: Ain't love grand? Then he washes his pecs in the sink.No love or pity exists in this bleak, doomed dystopia. Society's social and structural order exists only to protect the interests of the wealthy and privileged (See C. Wright Mills, Karl Marx, Chomsky, etc, etc). Entertainment is an anodyne that prevents anyone from paying attention to this. The transgressive affair between Frank and Nada (a feminine sounding name for a guy who means ""nothing"" to this world) is part of their rebellion.Nada and Frank make their way to a secret cell of insurrectionists led by... Meatloaf! Much ass-kicking ensues. There are lasers, secret portals and gunfights amid the aliens and the innocent and those that have thrown in with the aliens. The Woman comes back, threatening another rift between Nada and Frank because Frank is so jealous. By the end, its clear that she's a Judas.The aliens are defeated when the device making them look human is destroyed and the psychotic dream becomes reality in a gag sequence that saves the lowest joke for last.With its striking imagery and paranoiac premise, They Live distinguished itself from the average dopey action movie. But its the incredibly misogynistic interracial gayness, explored so blatantly, that packs the most punch. Truly subversive. The first audience would've needed special sunglasses to see it. It slid by undetected, until the effect is felt later, like the subliminal obscenities that Tyler Durden spliced into family movies.",They Live
361,jbhutt0,Like an episode of The Twilight Zone on steroids....,8,29 July 2005,"An episode of The Twilight Zone mixed in with a nice helping of balls to the wall action is about as accurately as I can describe this movie. First off, the pacing is really good. Carpenter doesn't waste any time getting into the heart of the matter and there's no lengthy exposition that you would normally want to skip through(I'm looking at you, Hook). While I don't want to spoil any of the story, I can tell you that it features Roddy Piper kicking copious amounts of ass. They Live is infamous for a fight scene in which Piper and Keith David beat the crap out of each other for about 10 minutes, all because Keith's character doesn't try on a pair of sunglasses. So if nothing else that's one reason to check it out.Roddy Piper does a really good acting job in this, at least in my opinion. It's not exactly award winning material but Piper has such charisma and ability to command the screen that you find yourself rooting for him and eager to go along on the ride. For a film of this nature the overall theme of the story is surprising as well. I think it could've been taken a little further but that's a minor complaint.While I don't believe They Live is quite up there with Escape From New York or The Thing, it's still one of my personal favorites by Carpenter and a movie I would recommend to anyone. Just watch it, you won't regret it.If you like this I recommend: Most of John Carpenter's other movies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers(1974), Dark City, and a few others I can't think of right now.",They Live

From the moment Roddy Pipers character puts on the glasses that show him the truth behind the media, you are questioning what is the true nature of media in the real world. Everyone wants to believe that their worldview is the absolute truth and anyone else with a different worldview is brainwashed by outsiders with more nefarious interests. If you were told that putting on a pair of sunglasses would show you the true nature of the world, you would be resistant just like Keith Davids character in the film. Everyone is comfortable in the way they view the world and are resistant to change.Overall a really good movie. Lots of classic 80's action and a great John Carpenter score.

365,TheDirector451,80's One Lining Super Mullet Badass,10,3 March 2018,"John Carpenter's 1988 film ""They Live"" is one of the most original made films I've ever seen. It's very similar to almost all of his other work, the usual anti-hero saving the world by doing a good deed for the hell of it or It's usually for survival.
John Nada is the main character who is played by Roddy Piper, we don't hear the hero's name at all, but it is implied that his name is Nada. Anyway, Nada starts off as a drifter looking for a simple job for simple cash to survive. He stumbles upon a homeless camp along with some construction work with Keith David, which ends up going well until Nada develops a habit of getting curious with the church across the street distributing something odd. When the truth is revealed, things get cool. Like not having enough bubble gum, so you start kicking ass type of ""Cool"". This movie is the perfect documentary for not only what it's story is telling, but if you want a sick unpredictable action thriller that you can watch over and over without getting bored then this movie is it.. This movie to me is a cult classic that everyone should experience. One of my all time favorites.

I have awarded it ten stars out of ten, and, in my fantasy life as a Citizenship instructor, made it required viewing for my classes. Plus the action kicks butt!We've all seen the story of the helpless victim more times than we can count.  _They Live_ is not one of those tales.  Don't look for it on Lifetime any time soon.  Our hero (Roddy Piper as Nada) has been dumped on enough to dismiss any hope of his friendly neighborhood social worker, the ghost of FDR or divine intervention to redraw his lot.  In refusing to accept fate, he ultimately must lose, but, darn it, he isn't going down without delivering a fresh crop of souls to Hades.  His jihad's sword has two edges as his evangelism bypasses fire and brimstone speeches for the cold, sharp slap of the sensei. At that moment (well, actually, after eighteen minutes) Frank, the student, is enlightened.  What a great excuse for savage violence!Many feel threatened by _They Live_ because on the surface it appears to be an attack on their politics.  These folks need to take a step back.  A broader perspective reveals that it is not material possessions and power that choke the soul in Carpenter's _oeuvre_ but rather the filth stirred up by the enemy's march down the muddy paths of fraud, subjugation and prostitution.  This is a truth that most would agree with,  regardless of whose lever they pull on election day.  Viewed in context, then, not only does blasting away at Andromedans and Yuppie scum become justifiable, but watching them die becomes even neater.Sure, _They Live_ is heavy-handed, shameless propaganda.  Heck, it's _Alexander Nevsky_, _The Battleship Potemkin_ and _Why We Fight_ multiplied by ten.  But that's what makes it great fun.  There is a certain appeal to the story of a true believer making the ultimate sacrifice so that all nations may see.  Combine that with a double (triple?) digit body count and you've completed an equation whose solution is plopping down in front of the tube for an hour and a half with a six pack and a big bag of pretzels.  No need to keep the remote in your hand.  Better a pencil and pad to tally the casualties.It is possible that more impressionable viewers may exhibit signs of sociopathic paranoia after viewing _They Live_.

There's a lot of cheesy moments and the film is quite dated, but most of the flaws of the film add to They Live's overall charm. The premise is hilarious--that the rich and powerful are ugly aliens that are plotting the demise of those less fortunate. In the middle of the film is a long, hilarious fight scene. As another reviewer noted, the femme fatale lead is meant to be a knock-out but she looks more like a robot. The subconscious messages (which the characters can only view with special sunglasses) of billboards and commercial signs in the film are a bit simple-minded but still very effective.

It is ironic, to say the least, that the propagandists have mystified the growth of global warming andglobal dimming while feeding WMD lies and propaganda to us so successfully.

Rowdy Roddy Piper does a great job and I must admit I was surprised by his performance. Meg Foster with those beautiful evil eyes is stunning.

379,scoreseller,Not the best Carpenter film,4,24 December 2007,"I have just finished watching this film and I'm left feeling disappointed because the hyped-up reviews (claiming this to be the best movie directed by John carpenter), are completely misleading & untrue. As a Horror & Sci-fi fan, I enjoyed it - it's OK! but it does not deserve the rating that some ""fans"" are crediting it with. It's very slow to begin with and takes about 30 minutes to kick-in with the the main theme of the film, which is very good by the way. The story line is excellent, and ahead of it's time, but it could have been so much better. I would not try to put-off anybody from watching this: if your a sci-fi fan, you will patiently watch it & enjoy some of the movie's better moments & like me, look forward to a possible remake.",They Live

381,salsadancerva,"""They Live"" by John Carpenter is horrible.",1,7 April 2010,"I understand a remake of this 1988 movie is in production now - why? It was horrible the first time, and I do not expect much better the second time around, since it is the same director. The first movie had horrible acting, horrible writing, and horrible directing.The lead role then, (1988) was played by a professional wrestling star, ""Rowdy"" Rod Piper, and the smaller parts were nothing worth mentioning either, with exception of Keith David who played Armitage.The script was poorly written, for it does not show why Meg Foster's character, Holly did not have the unusual and scary kind of night-of-the-living dead face as her other cronies, and looked completely human. Yet she pushes Rod's character, Nada off a balcony with such strength, but Nada can't identify her like he can the other enemies with the sunglasses. The script also does not reveal why some of the deaders can push a button on their sci-fi wristwatch and disappear quickly, while others don't even try, and instead are shot and killed by Nada and the good guys. Then there is the matter of the sunglasses themselves, which don't appear to be any particular kind or brand or with any special characteristics to reveal the walking dead, as if any old pair of sunglasses will do just fine. Yet the deaders are amazed, and exclaim ""We have one that can see."" Yeah - no special sunglasses, just an ordinary sundry item that you can get anywhere, and the deaders didn't think about that beforehand. Really how gullible do you think the watching audience is? Plenty of other holes in the story also.The direction is poor, for why would John Carpenter have some scenes shot where it is one hour of the day inside and another hour of the day outside, but it is supposed to be the same time of day, like 5 minutes later. An no it is not because the movie takes place in a time warp, but just sloppy directing.The movie ""They Live"" is a rating of 1 out of 10, but only because I cannot rate it a zero.",They Live
382,eenieboy,"Not absolutely terrible, just very disappointing",5,28 August 2011,"Let me start by saying that before watching ""They Live"", I was by no means intending on, or in the mood for, being blown away or philosophically challenged by a film. I was bored, I found a cheesy movie with a half decent IMDb write-up, and I watched. The film's protagonist played by Roddy Piper wasn't too painful to watch, he was able to fit the role of a somber yet hopeful drifter quite well, but his acting skills were sadly stretched when his lines lasted more than one sentence. The initial half hour is very slow paced for such a cheesy action flick, but it does gradually heighten interest as to what is afoot in a well executed if not long drawn out way. Once the revelation of an earth in captivity is revealed however, it is milked. Dry. When the alien revealing glasses are first put on they stare and stare. Yes, the creatures are horrible and well crafted, yes the world has become a dystopian nightmare. I could have been shown that within a minute. the further 10 were not required. Another prime example of this bloated cinematography is in the TV studio, where corridor after corridor of guards jump out and meet their death at the hands of the heroes' guns. The director barely even bothers to change the camera angle or method in which they meet their demise, each shot nearly identical. Lather, rinse, repeat. The film continues throughout in this pattern, presenting good ideas and set pieces but ruining them with either bad acting, directing, or dialogue (I'm not talking about the cheesy one liners, some were quite funny!). The film constantly piqued my interest with it's humour and immersive ideas, only to ruin it every time. It focused far too much on fairly unnecessary parts of the script, failed to be at all concise and (with the exception of the amazing fist fight) contained dull action sequences. That on top of a dollop of cheese and frequent bad acting from the protagonist was really enough to almost completely ruin it for me, even though it did show slight promise throughout with the fertile plot, humour and occasional (very occasional) tight directing Carpenter is capable of.",They Live
383,jazzpilot,Good action movie with a decent concept behind it.,8,25 October 2003,"""They Live"" is a classic John Carpenter film, although not up to the quality of other JC films such as ""The Thing"".

It is still a very worth-while film that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys good science fiction",They Live
384,kingalric,A movie from which ideas are in life and even in computer games,10,12 March 2011,"Spoilers ahead... The movie They Live, brings foreword the human condition and how it unfolds. The plot is simple, but effective, about a simple man, Nada. We do not know anything about his past, he meets some people who introduce him, rather abruptly, in the world controlled by aliens. They are seen only with special glasses. The film is worth seeing, even if the idea is simple and i will not tell the end of the movie here. I will make a parallel of words and I will say the link between this film and computer games. It seems that, according to director John Carpenter, Rowdy Roddy Piper invented the words ''I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass ... and I'm all out of bubblegum. These words you will find in Duke Nukem 3D : 'It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum ... and I'm All Outta Gum."" Of course Rowdy Roddy Piper has said it a little different. I do not know if anyone has said this two ideas and this contains spoilers from the movie but is related to computer games, is the fact that aliens are using a clock teleporter thingy, is like what they use in Duke Nukem 3D or some sort of a device. And the second idea i have is that the fact that, when Nada and his friend are fighting the aliens and the clock that teleports is damaged, something will happen like in the game Portal, a blue -red portal will appear Some would say that the film is based on a real idea, others not. It's up to us to believe or not what is actually referring or at least the idea of the director John Carpenter.",They Live

Both Carpenter and Piper have made some awful movies, but this isn't one of them. I love the way the movie manages to combine great characters with lots of fun-filled violence.
This movie contains two terrific scene's that it a must-see. The first is the movie's best line, ""I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick..."". You'll probably recognize it because it has been ripped off by certain video games and cartoon characters (and probably a few hundred others I don't know about). But nobody can deliver that line like Roddy Piper. A little later on, the viewer is treated to the fight scene between Piper and David. This is an absolute gem. From what I understand, the two actors decided to really kick the crap out of each other and just let the camera roll. Carpenter added his trademark dark humor and the result the most incredibly brutal yet hilarious street fight to ever be put on film.If you like your movies to be enlightening, go somewhere else. If your looking for entertainment, you can't go wrong with `They Live'.",They Live
387,major_kong,underrated,8,19 March 2004,"""They Live"" is a good movie where you would least expect to find one. It is low budget, but suspenseful and actually scary in places. It is obvious that the work and money went into the writing, story, and direction. All of the actors do a good job, including Roddy Piper and his mullet, and features the longest fight scene you'll ever want to see. It gets a tad predictable toward the end, but that's okay. This movie was made in the 1980s (and doesn't look dated) and its message is more pertinent than ever. The build-up is excellent and spooky. Goes to prove that all that CGI unnecessary when the story is good. I always try to catch this when it's on TV. SUBMIT.",They Live

They Live is witty without being too cheeky, it's deep without being too philosophical, it's tacky without being too grungy. In short, Carpenter perfectly balanced every ingredients of a great movie in this one. It's hard to classify this piece in a single genre, while Carpenter is a master of horror and some elements of the genre are definitely present, They Live can also pass as a great comedy, thriller, action, and sci-fi movie.The storyline is fresh even decades later, the main characters are likable and relatable, and it has one of the (if not THE) greatest fighting scene ever!",They Live

It encompasses a mix between drama, political plot and conspiracy related to control the masses.

It is similar to TV shows such as the Simpsons or South Park, in that they are allowed to express controversial viewpoints due to the fact the shows are animated. In this instance, it is accepted because on the surface, They Live appears to be science fiction, but it is not. This movie is actually a satirical attack on rampant consumerism, greed, elitist control of the masses, trans-global corporations and profiteering from natural resources. Although most of these problems existed long before this movie was made, they were vaulted to new heights during the Reaganomics era of the 80's, and have continued onward to this day with no end in sight. Ever wonder why you feel worthless, insecure and ill at ease? Do you ever feel like a sheep being led by an invisible shepherd? TV tells you that you are too fat, your teeth aren't white enough, and that your clothes are outdated. TV tells you that happiness lies only a phone call away-for the next 29.99 QVC garbage product that will last less than a year.

John Carpenter follows on from 'Big Trouble in Little China' with this masterpiece of modern action movies. I was lent the DVD over a year ago, and to my sad admission, let it sit on a shelf for more than 6 months.....big mistake. Being a person who prides himself on his knowledge of 80s action movies, the fact that Id missed this one really makes me hang my head in shame. You might at first be forgiven for thinking that this is meant to be a spoof...and I still do! The acting is ludicrously poor, the action is (of course) over the top and the plot jumps from one scene to the next with no explanation as to how or why. Ever wanted to see two grown men having a fight using proper wrestling moves in a back alley?! Or hear the immortal line ""I came here to kick *ss and chew gum...and I'm all out of gum""?

This is, hands down, the single most important mainstream commentary on international politics- and the sorry mental state of the general populace- ever made, even more creative and pointed than George Orwell. It is a blistering indictment of the power elite in this country and others- greed and love of money and power knows no geographical boundaries- and is a testament to the power of the arts to convey important messages that would be banned for their ""controversiality"" if they were not wrapped in the guise of, oh, say, a B- science fiction movie. If you have never seen this movie, then please, PLEASE go rent it. It is not difficult, it requires very little stretch of the imagination to ascertain what the filmmakers were really trying to say. It is simply a bold, inventive, ingenious political statement of the sort few are brave enough to make.

399,theshotgunterror,One of the best movies ever,10,9 July 2005,"First off this movie is by probably one of my favorite (if not my favorite) directors John Carpenter. I grew up watching this movie and about a year ago I re-rented it cause I hadn't seen it since I was at least 9 or 10 and I was just stunned. Movies aren't made like this anymore. It explores a question held by the truly analytical people of this world who question the subliminal messages in the media of our society. This movie takes it one step further and adds the element of maybe some of the these law makers/media folk are actually aliens from another planet trying to hypnotize us. The idea of this movie is just amazing and the scenery is spectacular. The comic underlying fits incredibly well with this movie (the comments Roddy Piper makes are hilarious).This is going a little far, but this movie also reminds me of the Megadeth album ""Peace sells......but who's buying"". I don't know if Carpenter was a megadeth fan, but this cd is practically the soundtrack to the movie. The album has a lot to do with social questioning and even at the end of one of ""The Conjuring"" he says OBEY, just like in the movie.I might have gone off on a little tangent, but I really enjoyed this movie. If you are a fan of Alien/sci-fi/political questioning type movies, then definitely go out and rent or even buy this movie.",They Live

In a way, I'm glad, because I'm not sure I would have appreciated it as much then as I do now. The same happened with Blade Runner. If I did see it in the past, I don't remember it or didn't like it, but now it's one of my favorites.As far as acting goes, I didn't expect much from the late Roddy Piper. He does a good enough job. Keith David is solid like he is in just about everything. There are definitely some hokey parts of the movie to nitpick about, but overall, they can be overlooked.The satirical take on our culture and consumer-driven lifestyle in the US is still very relevant in 2016. People need to wake up. I'm not saying all conspiracy theories are true, but there's some middle ground between the world most of us see and the world of They Live which is the true reality. Unfortunately, as Carpenter put it, "" those ""who go to the movies in vast numbers these days don't want to be enlightened"".I am absolutely not a fan of remakes.

I thought this was an incredibly entertaining movie and I would not hesitate to put it in my ""best of all time movies list"" when I get around to making one.Roddy Piper is great as a ""lone wolf"" type hero who realizes something is very wrong in society.

What about Hulk Hogan in No Holds Barred? Piper somehow managed to escape the bad wrestler actors formula and turns in a pretty good performance.That's not what I'm grading this movie on. It's campy and there is a few select extremely goofy parts. What I am grading this movie on is the creativity. The story is so interesting. A movie like this could only exist in the 80s and the only person for the job was obviously John Carpenter.This movie makes you think. It may not be far off from the truth. I highly doubt there is hidden messages in advertisements but submiminal messaging is a very real marketing ploy used by companies to persuade people to buy. Makes you wonder how deep down the rabbit hole you would go to convince other people to ""put on the glasses"" and see the manipulation.10/10 for me.
