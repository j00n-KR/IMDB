0,bkoganbing,"Ya Got Trouble, Right Here In Gatlin City",7,6 September 2007,"Maybe if those kids in Gatlin, Nebraska had gotten a visit from Professor Harold Hill and a boys band out of it, maybe they might not have killed all their parents. This Stephen King view of the mid-west sure makes one nostalgic for The Music Man.It's one strange place that married couple Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton have come on their cross country journey. It reminded me of driving through Pennsylvania and the Amish country where you cannot get off the Pennsylvania Turnpike for ages, but on either side of the roads, nothing but woods and on the overpasses, Amish carts. Here it's nothing but corn and when Peter Horton thinks he's hit a child on the road he goes for help and there's none. The town has been taken over by the devil himself working his evil through a young child preacher played by John Franklin. All the adults have been killed and the children are his disciples.Of course some of the older ones are reaching puberty and the guy who was the high school bully Courtney Gains chafes under Franklin's leadership. He tries a palace coup d'etat, something along the lines of what old Lucifer himself did in heaven and everybody pays.Children of the Corn is a good adaption of the Stephen King novel, it will please his legion of fans and maybe convert a few others.",Children of the Corn
1,Leofwine_draca,Deeply flawed but has its moments,5,26 February 2016,"In a remote ghost town, children kill any adult who enters the village; their motive, false religion. One day a couple drive into the town, soon learning something is wrong, and it is up to them to stop the senseless sacrifices before they are slaughtered. Aided by two innocent children, they are up against the manic Malachai and some unseen horror known only as He Who Walks Behind The Rows...My expectations were low for this film after seeing so many other distinctly average offerings from the ""based on"" Stephen King catalogue of cinema. However I was pleasantly surprised by the film, it's not often that I find myself laughing out loud at a movie, but I just couldn't help myself in this case. It starts off well enough, as a spooky little atmospheric film, the most effective scenes where the helpless couple are driving around seemingly endless dirt tracks in the corn.However, as soon as the main male lead, played by Peter Norton, is stabbed in the chest (with seemingly no effect) things just go a little over-the-top and start to get funny. They then build up to the climax where I was pleased to see bad '80s animated special effects come into play. Well, some of them weren't that bad, but they weren't exactly VOLCANO-style computer generations. Maybe I am spoilt by SFX these days, but back projection is getting a little dated.The monster really remains unseen during the film, appearing underground in a TREMORS-style way, it tears up the ground as it speeds along. The acting was also good for a change. The children weren't too annoying, and I actually found myself liking the unaffected kid in the film. Malachai I recognised from somewhere, and the IMDb soon revealed to me that I also saw him in THE 'BURBS a while back. Isaac wasn't exactly what I'd call scary though.Peter Norton was quite good as the lead, he redeemed his nondescript acting at the start of the film by a speech where he shouted that ""religion not based on love is false!"" Linda Hamilton, in the same year she made THE TERMINATOR, sadly has little to do but run around and scream as the heroine. Come to think of it that's about all she did in THE TERMINATOR as well. At least her character was fleshed out a little there. The film remains unsettling at times, and is enhanced by the director's decision not to show some of the deaths, instead only hint at them (saying that, there is a meaty scene where an old guy gets his hand pushed into some sort of grinder). It wasn't overly gory but this added to it for me. The climax was fairly entertaining, but really a case of ""big explosions don't compensate for tying-up plot threads"" again. It's not a good film by any means, and it remains clichéd, but I enjoyed it and that's what counts.",Children of the Corn
2,SnoopyStyle,unscary uncompelling Stephen King,4,22 February 2015,"It's Gatlin, Nebraska 3 years ago. The religious town relies on the corn harvest but they are suffering from a devastating drought. The children following the boy preacher Isaac Chroner kill all of the adults. In the present day, Burt (Peter Horton) and his girlfriend Vicky (Linda Hamilton) are traveling to Seattle for his new job. The couple runs over a boy who's trying to escape Gatlin. Burt puts the dead body into the trunk. Somebody had just cut the boy's throat before he stumbled onto the road. Isaac and his second-in-command Malachai rule the town with an iron fist in a religious cult.It takes a bit too long to get going. The opening lays out too much and leaves too little mystery to be revealed. Horton and Hamilton are fine actors. The movie never achieves any true tension. The narration and the little boy Job get a bit grating. As for the gore, the story is violent but much of the brutality is suggested. Although there are some good bloody aftermath. There isn't anything scary in this. It's like a long Twilight Zone episode. It may be more compelling to not to know too much about the kids or the town until later. It's not cinematic or scary enough. Horton's character is annoying. There isn't enough to care about. It just moves so slowly.",Children of the Corn
3,kosmasp,Not a bed in the corn field,6,18 April 2020,"Considering how much time some apparently spend there, it kind of would have made sense. But this aside and not having read the source material (Stephen King novel), I can only judge this ... well not by its cover, which I also haven't seen what it looks like yet.This horror movie is quite decent for the time I reckon, but that will not help too many people and what they feel about it. Linda Hamilton is quite fun to see, pre Terminator. Didn't even remember she was in this. But the story is quite simple and you probably will know where this is heading. Still practical effects and keeping things to the imagination of the viewer really make this an interesting experience. Unlike the remake, that supposedly is closer to the book but can not really generate any likeability for the characters or as much tension as this does",Children of the Corn
4,classicsoncall,"""He who walks behind the rows seeth all.""",7,23 August 2017,"I couldn't help thinking that the Stephen King short story and this film on which it was based, was inspired by a 1961, Rod Serling Twilight Zone episode titled 'It's a Good Life'. In that one, Billy Mumy portrays a boy a few years younger than Isaac (John Franklin) in this picture, who condemns an Ohio community by sheer force of mind and will. Instead of killing his opposition though, he telepathically transports them into what he calls a corn field, which one never gets to see in the story. Stephen King probably would have liked the kid.Well I know there will be some horror movie fans who will consider this film a top notch Stephen King adaptation, but when I plug it into my IMDb list of movies based on works by the horror master, it comes in dead last out of nineteen movies I've seen so far (as I write this). You can check it out in my list of Stephen King flicks I've watched and reviewed. This felt like a made for TV movie more than anything else, and it never seemed credible to me why Burt (Peter Horton) and his girlfriend Vicky (Linda Hamilton) decided to hang around the drought afflicted town of Gatlin, Nebraska, except for the fact that Horton ran down a kid in the middle of the road, who for all intents and purposes was already dead with a slashed throat. They eventually run across a kid cult led by a creepy leader called Isaac, and a henchman who he later suffers a falling out with. The actor Courtney Gains was perfectly cast as a psychotic looking killer who for comparison purposes was Mick Jagger ugly times two. When the time came for Burt to tangle with Malachai one on one, you'd have to conclude that their battle was done pro-wrestling style, that is, most of Burt's punches missed by a mile.Well I've read more than my share of novels and stories by Stephen King, and some of the movie adaptations of his work are outstanding ('The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Shining'), while others plumb the depths ('The Dark Half', 'Sometimes They Come Back'). As I mentioned earlier, this one sets the bar in the wrong direction, but if you just have to, go ahead and see it. But don't be surprised by such things as the size and shape of the blood stain on Burt's shirt change from scene to scene after he gets stabbed by a corn obsessed delinquent.",Children of the Corn
5,gavin6942,One of the Better King Adaptations,6,6 July 2009,"A young couple, lost in the countryside, stumbles upon the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, where children have taken over the land, lead by Isaac and Malachi. But this is no peaceful kid commune -- Isaac is a preacher for He Who Walks Behind the Rows, a vengeful god who wishes death to all adults and those who wrong him.Stephen King's stories tend to get developed into fairly lackluster films. I could name a few, but I will not. ""Children of the Corn"" is a notable exception, being one of the staples of 1980s horror, and spawning numerous sequels. Featuring Linda Hamilton (before playing Sarah Connor in ""Terminator""), this is a noteworthy story of evil children, in the vein of ""Who Can Kill a Child?"" and ""Village of the Damned"". For truly, if children are innocent, how can one fight back against a bloodthirsty mob of toddlers? This film succeeds on the grounds of being an interesting story, without the need of gore or sex. In fact, despite multiple murders, the camera more often than not pans away or we are not treated to the actual vision of death. One of the most disturbing images -- a crucified police officer -- is still fairly mild and may even have a sense of black humor for the fans.The actors should be noted for creating a quality film. Aside from Hamilton and her co-star Peter Horton (who has long since been forgotten), the children deserve credit for giving mature and compelling performances. Isaac is a strong preacher, and the ginger kid Malachi is threatening. Sure, one looks like a young Patton Oswalt and the other should star in ""Pete and Pete"", but we can excuse that. Even the girl who plays Sarah should be heralded for her shy and reserved display.We have producer Donald P. Borchers to thank for this film; he started off at the bottom with Avco Embassy under Robert Rehme, and eventually got to the point where he could look over scripts. After seeing 100 scripts that ripped off other films, he found this original concept about religion, dogma and blind faith. The script from George Goldsmith refined King's story, reducing the exposition but making it more conventional in pacing and structure. He used the Iran hostage crisis as his inspiration, which really makes the material deeper than it appears on the surface.Goldsmith got into screen writing through a producer named Steve, and they made a series starring John Saxon and kung fu fighting (of which no record appears to exist). Goldsmith made changes, including adding the two good children. King and Goldsmith clashed, with King accusing Goldsmith of not understanding horror, and Goldsmith telling King he did not understand cinema. For what it is is worth, I believe Goldsmith was correct.Bonus facts: Robby Kiger, the kid who plays Job in this film, was also in ""The Monster Squad"" (1987), and cinematographer João Fernandes was a cameraman for adult features before he switched to genre films. All the clever angles in ""Deep Throat""? That would be Fernandes.Fans of 1980s horror really should have this in their collection, and now thanks to Arrow Video, they can acquire a high quality Blu-Ray version with never before seen special features. Audio commentary, cast and crew interviews and more are on this disc. Anchor Bay had previously released a Blu-ray, but there is a clear difference with Arrow's new 2K restoration from the original negative. For those who have never seen it or those watching for the hundredth time, Arrow's ""Children of the Corn"" is well worth owning.Special features include: Brand new audio commentary with film historian John Sullivan and journalist Justin Beahm; audio commentary with director Fritz Kiersch, producer Terrence Kirby and actors John Franklin and Courtney Gains; a retrospective piece featuring interviews with director Fritz Kiersch and actors John Franklin and Courtney Gains; an interview with actress Linda Hamilton; brand new featurette revisiting the film's original Iowa shooting locations; interview with producer Donald Borchers; interview with production designer Craig Stearns and composer Jonathan Elias; interview with the actor who played ""The Blue Man"" in the fabled excised sequence; a new 17-minute interview with writer George Goldsmith, and new interviews with Julie Maddalena and John Philbin (50 minutes combined!).",Children of the Corn
6,lee_eisenberg,"Obviously, someone's not eating their vegetables...",5,28 March 2006,"OK, we all know that when a book gets turned into a movie, they're bound - to play off of a movie title - to lose something in translation. I've never read Stephen King's story ""Children of the Corn"", but the movie comes out silly at best. Portraying couple Burt (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton) stopping in a Nebraska town where the children have murdered the adults, the movie makes you wonder if it's trying to be tongue-in-cheek. If not, it's just plain weak. The only other cast member whom I recognized was Courtney Gains, who later appeared in Joe Dante's underrated movie ""The 'Burbs"". All in all, if we just accept this movie as a ridiculous '80s movie, it's not all that bad; otherwise, it makes our eyes roll.",Children of the Corn
7,jboothmillard,Children of the Corn,2,17 June 2020,"I had heard the title of this scary movie, I knew it had evil children in it, that it had the star of The Terminator (made a short time before its release), and that it had negative reviews, but I was always going to watch it, based on the book by Stephen King. Basically, it is set in the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, an agricultural community surrounded by huge cornfields. In 1980, the corn crop fails, so the townsfolk turn to prayer to ensure a successful harvest. However, twelve-year-old Isaac Chroner (John Franklin) takes all the children of the town into the cornfields and indoctrinates them into a religious cult based around a bloodthirsty deity called ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"". Isaac and his subordinate, eighteen-year-old Malachi Boardman (Courtney Gains), lead the children in a revolution, murdering all the adults (ages 19 and up) in town as human sacrifices, poisoning and butchering them. Only Job (Robby Kiger) and his sister Sarah (Anne Marie McEvoy) are not involved. Sarah is revealed to have visions and premonitions, which are portrayed through her drawings. Three years later, on the day of Halloween, Vicky Baxter (Linda Hamilton) and her boyfriend Burt Stanton (Peter Horton) travel through rural Nebraska on their way to Seattle, where Burt will start working as a physician. Young boy Joseph (Jonas Marlowe) tries to flee Gatlin, but is attacked in the corn, and he stumbles into the road where Burt accidentally hits him with his car. Burt discovers that his throat was cut beforehand. Burt and Vicky place Joseph and his suitcase in their trunk and search for a phone to call for help. They find elderly mechanic Diehl (Predator's R.G. Armstrong), the last adult in Gatlin, but he refuses them service. Diehl is in an agreement to supply the children with fuel in exchange for his life. But the merciless Malachi breaks the pact and murders him, against Isaac's wishes, when Diehl tries to steer the couple away from Gatlin. Vicky and Burt explore the abandoned town and find Sarah alone in a house. While Vicky stays with her, Burt searches the town. Malachi and his followers appear, Vicky is captured and taken to the cornfield, where they place her on a cross to be sacrificed. Burt enters the church, where a congregation of children led by young Rachel (Julie Maddalena) are performing a cultural birthday ritual for Amos (John Philbin) by drinking his blood. Amos has turned 19, so is considered old enough for his ""passing"". Burt is enraged by the children participating in a blood ritual, an angered Rachel stabs him, then Malachi and the others chase him. Job rescues Burt and they hide in a fallout shelter with Sarah, where they learn Vicky was captured, and agree to help him rescue her. The zealous Isaac scolds Malachi for his treachery in killing Diehl, their only source of fuel. Malachi, tired of Isaac's preaching, takes over, ordering Isaac to be sacrificed instead of Vicky. Isaac warns Malachi that sacrificing him will break their pact with He Who Walks Behind the Rows and the children will be severely punished. That night, Burt sneaks into the cornfield to rescue Vicky. During Isaac's sacrifice, a supernatural light appears and devours the screaming Isaac. Burt fights with Malachi, and after pushing him to the ground, Burt convinces the children to abandon the cult and run for safety. But Isaac suddenly reappears, revived by He Who Walks Behind the Rows. The possessed Isaac tells Malachi that the deity is angered over him being sacrificed, saying he wants his sacrifice to; he seizes and kills the terrified Malachi by breaking his neck. A storm appears over the cornfield, and Burt and Vicky shelter the children in a barn. Burt and Vicky read a passage in the Bible Job gives him, but Vicky realises the only way to stop the false god is to destroy the cornfield. Burt sprays the cornfield with gasohol and tosses a gasoline bomb into the field, setting it alight and destroying the demon along with Isaac. Vicky, Burt, Job, and Sarah return to the car to leave Gatlin, but find it disabled. Rachel attacks Burt, but Vicky knocks her out with the car door. The adults and the children depart, heading for Seattle on foot. I can see why this film has gained a cult following, Hamilton is reasonable, but it absolutely the youngsters who steal the show, especially Franklin as the preacher and Gains as his sidekick. I agree the opening slaughter is the most sinister, the dialogue, full of biblical mumbo-jumbo, is ludicrous and laughable (in a good way) (I recognised the line ""Outlander! We have your woman!"" from the spoof episode of South Park), and although a good concept it could be slightly more atmospheric, there was the smallest part of me that enjoyed it, but overall it is a silly horror. Pretty poor!",Children of the Corn
8,rmax304823,The Corn -- The Really ALIEN Corn.,5,20 January 2013,"Steven King makes an effort to get out of East Quoddy fairly often -- Colorado or someplace. Here, it's Gatlin, Nebraska, a town in which all the adults have been slaughtered in the bloodiest fashion by their children. Gatlin is now depopulated, the streets littered, the shops closed, no services -- just kids sneaking around and worshiping a god of the corn. They got religion. The religion they got seems lifted from Sir James Frazer's ""The Golden Bough"", which described pagan religion as fertility rites in the crops, and periodic sacrifice.The kids here have the sacrifice part down pat. Their last sacrifice, ""the blue man"", is a dead cop whose shrunken corpse is strung up on a cross made of wood and cornstalks. They screwed up the fertility part, though. Instead of copulating in the cornfields like decent law-abiding pagans, all they do is kill anybody who crosses them. That's no way to grow corn.It's into this stagnant pit of religious retrogression that newly minted doctor Peter Horton and his wife Linda Hamilton gaily stumble. They're driving through the flatlands of Nebraska on the way to Horton's internship out west but they slam into a kid who is standing in the middle of the deserted road with his throat already cut. This causes them to lose their élan. And they do everything wrong. All the roads seem to lead them to Gatlin, a place they've been warned against visiting. Instead of gaping for a moment at the ominously deserted town and then speeding away towards the sun, they begin to explore the place. They don't know it, but one of the members of the kiddie cult has had a vision identifying them as the next sacrifices.I won't go on with this silliness. I don't know what King's original story was like, but the director of this film can't WAIT to shock us with blood and violence, and he does so without nuance or originality. The pre-credits opening scene is filled with blood letting and poisoning. And just after Horton and Hamilton run over the kid, Hamilton falls asleep in the car (if you can believe it) and has a horrible dream which is presented to the viewer as reality -- until she awakes with a yelp and a big BANG on the sound track, called a ""sting"" in the industry. R. G. Armstrong and his dog Sarge show up for a few moments, only to be butchered like everybody else.The thing is, if this had been handled differently it might have been so much better. The photography and location shooting are fine. The uniform countryside seems to run on forever, an ocean of level crops. There really is something eerie about miles and miles of cornfields. You can't help looking at this sea of pea-green leaves, brushed by the occasional soft breeze, and the scattered tiny towns with shops that sell farm implements, used pick up trucks, and Redman chewing tobacco. Everything is so tranquil that you can't help but wonder what the hell is GOING ON! But the rush to get into the bath tub of gore ruins it. Good horror stories let you in little by little. They don't stuff your face into it right off the bat, the Berlitz method of movie making.The acting isn't bad except for one of the kids, a tall pale red head with a protruding jaw, whose looks are repellent enough but who speaks with a Valley accent and, not to be too blunt about it, can't act. Peter Horton does okay by the doctor. He's rather tall and lanky. He looks like he runs daily, which every doctor should do. Linda Hamilton looks peachy with her robust features, broad ramus and plump lips. She was my supporting player in the classic commercial and critical hit, ""King Kong Lives."" She was a little nervous at the time but I helped her over the rough spots. She was grateful enough to send me Christmas cards each year with personal checks for fifteen cents enclosed.If you want to see a much better movie about modern pagans worshiping their crops, try ""The Wicker Man."" If you want to see a better movie about mysterious cornfields, watch ""Field of Dreams."" ""Children of the Corn"" is a grindhouse product.",Children of the Corn
9,Tweekums,Effective low budget horror,7,9 December 2019,"The town of Gatlin, in Nebraska, has been suffering from a drought when child-preacher Isaac arrives and tells the children of the town that to appease god they must make a blood sacrifice of all the adults. This order is carried out under the guidance of Malachai, his violent enforcer. Three years pass and a young couple, Burt and Vicky, are driving through Nebraska. Suddenly a child walks out of the corn in front of their car and they hit him; it is clear that he had had his throat cut. They drive on and find themselves in Gatlin; the town appears abandoned but they soon discover the frightening truth... any adult will be sacrificed.This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is a solid low budget horror... at least up until the disappointing ending. It opens well with the murder of the town's adults, this is more creepy than gory. The main characters are then effectively introduced; Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton are good in the roles of Vicky and Burt; two ordinary people who are easy to sympathise with. Once they get near Gatlin the tension rises nicely and soon gets genuinely scary. The story does require some suspension of disbelief... we have to accept that the children could kill every adult in town and that nobody from outside would realise anything was wrong for three years. The idea of children as the source of danger might not be new but it is effective; John Franklin and Courtney Gains are suitably disturbing as Isaac and Malachai. Things work very well when it looks as if the threat is just children under the leadership of a young religious zealot which is why the supernatural finale, with its poor special effects, was so disappointing. Overall I'd still recommend this to fans of low budget horror.",Children of the Corn

11,BA_Harrison,Corny King clunker.,4,25 May 2008,"Nearly everything that Stephen King has ever written seems to have been turned into a film or TV series; in fact, I'm surprised that no one has tried to make a mini-series from the guy's grocery list. Let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be any less interesting than Children of the Corn.Based on one of King's many short stories, this 1984 horror flick sees Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton playing a couple on a long car journey who run into a spot of bother when they chance upon the sleepy Nebraska town of Gatlin, where all of the adults have been murdered by children who worship an ancient evil that lurks in the corn fields.Although director Fritz Kiersch does manage to build a fair amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after Hamilton's silly song and dance, but before we get to meet the freakish Isaac, leader of the killer kids), he completely blows it with endless unexciting scenes in which Hamilton and Horton are hunted down by the town's homicidal half-pints. Courtney Gains, as violent redhead Malachai, manages to appear genuinely menacing, but the rest of the children are not the least bit threatening; as a result, many of the film's 'scary' moments fail to work. Towards the end of the film, when we finally get to see the malevolent force that inhabits the field surrounding Gatlin, the film descends into a glut of terrible 80s visual effects that probably looked pretty ropey almost 25 years ago, but look positively laughable nowadays.Children of the Corn might be of interest to King fans keen to see how the writer's work has been translated to the big screen, but your average horror-film fan will be most unimpressed.",Children of the Corn
12,BandSAboutMovies,This gave birth to way too many children...,6,26 May 2018,"Children of the Corn started as a short story first published in Penthouse Magazine that was later collected in the 1978 book Night Shift. It's a story incredibly similar to Tom Tryon's novel (and the film) The Dark Secret of Harvest Home. You could also draw parallels to Narciso Ibáñez Serrador's Who Can Kill a Child? or Village of the Damned.Did you know that Children of the Corn was filmed once before? A short film called Disciples of the Crow was made in 1983 that's an abridged version of this story.This one was produced in 1984, with Gor and Tuff Turf director Fritz Kiersch at the helm. Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) are on their way to California when they drive through the cornfields of Nebraska and accidentally hit a young boy. However, when Burt exams the kid, it turns out that his throat had already been slit. Uh oh.As they examine the boy's suitcase, they discover a crucifix made of twisted corn husks. They head to the next town, Gatlin, to alert the authorities.They come across a mechanic who refuses them service. The truth is that he is the last adult in Gatlin. He's agreed to supply the children with services and fuel for his life, but the enforcer of the town, Malachai breaks the pact and murders him, angering their leader Isaac.When Burt and Vicky get to town, everything is out of date and there's a bad feeling in the air. Even worse, no one seems to be in town. They find a little girl named Sarah alone in a house, where Vicky stays while Burt explores. Malachai soon appears, capturing Vicky and taking her to be sacrificed in the cornfield.The only thing in town that's in shape is the church. Inside, Burt learn the truth of Gatlin - twelve years ago, everyone over nineteen was killed and the children took Biblical names after their murders.Now, they live under this religious order that demands that everyone over nineteen must be sacrificed. During a blood-drinking ritual, Burt starts to yell at the children. They chase him until another young boy named Job rescues him and they hide in a fallout shelter.Isaac and Malachai argue, with the older boy taking over and ordering his leader to be sacrificed. Isaac warns that this will anger their covenant with He Who Walks Behind the Rows and the children will be severely punished.That night, Burt goes to rescue Vicky and a horrible special effect devours Isaac. Seriously, this weird chroma key fuzz looks incredibly dated. Anyways, Burt fights to save his wife and a possessed Isaac reappears and breaks Malachai's neck.A storm appears as Burt, Vicky and the two children decide that they must destroy the cornfield with gasoline and fire. They escape the town, taking the kids with them, their marriage somehow saved and they even discuss adopting the kids (but not before a sneak attack by Ruth is foiled).This overly happy ending stands in marked contrast to the downbeat tone of the novel, where Vicky is sacrificed and Burt is killed by the creature in the cornfield. The creature punishes the town by lowering the sacrifice age to eighteen, so Malachi and the elders all walk into the cornfield to die as Ruth wishes that she could kill He Who Walks Behind the Rows.",Children of the Corn
13,Coventry,Beware of Dude Who Walks Behind The Rows...,4,17 June 2005,"Horror movies based on Stephen King's writings are often very overrated and especially the ones inspired by his short stories are difficult to endure. It's pretty logical, I suppose... King made it a SHORT story, so a long-feature film handling about the same matter is likely to be tedious! ""Children of the Corn"" is an excellent example to state this 'theory': the idea is good and the atmosphere is creepy but the script is far too weak to make the film memorable. Vicky and Burt are a young couple on their way to a new life when they're driving through the lonely state of Nebraska. They strand in the grisly town of Gatlin; a place where the children murdered all the adults and formed a satanical cult that gathers in the immense corn fields. The premise contains many good aspects, like the isolated filming location, the compelling musical score, the appellation of the supernatural 'evil' character (He Who Walks Behind The Rows) and the casting of the town's two main freak-boys Isaac (John Franklin) and Malachai (redhead Courtney Gains in his debut). But, regretfully enough, there are too many clichés and predictable twists that ruin everything! The cheap visual effects during the finale destroy all the suspense which was build up rather ingeniously.""Children of the Corn"" certainly wasn't the first horror picture handling about murderous youngsters and by no means it is the best! In 1976, there was this creepy Spanish gem called ""Quién Puede Matar a un Niño"", which easily qualifies as one of the most disturbing horror efforts ever made. The reason why this film is so successful compared to ""Children of the Corn"" is partly because of the evoked feelings of total hopelessness AND because it constantly remains unclear why the children suddenly became violent.",Children of the Corn

Children of the Corn is one of those movies that horror fans of a certain age, who started to blossom in the 1980s, remember fondly but agree that now it's a bit, well, corny.Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton get trapped in a village of the damned where the children have killed the adults and established a religious order that gives worship to the devil of the corn. Isaac Chroner (John Franklin) and Malachai Boardman (Courtney Gains) head the creepy kid cult, corn does sway, blood does flow, poor special effects do down the devil, yet it's atmospheric as heck fire and still a bunch of fun if you forgive it its dated foibles. 6/10",Children of the Corn
15,poolandrews,"""Gatlin! What? Do they have a monopoly on road signs?"" One of the better King adaptations? I think so...",7,11 December 2005,"Children of the Corn starts in 'Gatlin, Nebraska Three Years Ago' where, suddenly & without warning, the town's children brutally kill all the adults seemingly orchestrated by a creepy young preacher boy named Isaac (John Franklin)... The film then switches to the 'Present Day' as lovers Burton Stanton (Peter Horton) & Vicky Baxter (Linda Hamilton) are on a long journey through the middle of nowhere when a teenage boy named Joseph (Jonas Marlowe) stumbles out into the road, Burt cannot stop in time & hits him head on. Burt & Vicky rush to help but find him already dead & even worse he has had his throat cut. They decide to head to the nearest town & report the incident, the nearest town being Gatlin. Once there they discover the place totally deserted, in a state of ruin & corn lying around everywhere. The also quickly discover that Isaac has created his own religious cult by convincing all the town's children to worship a god known as 'He Who Walk's Behind the Rows' where adults are offered as sacrifices. Isaac says that Burt & Vicky will do nicely, he sends the murderous Malachai (Courtney Gains) & the rest of the children to get them, however not all the children in Gatlin believe Isaac & young siblings Job (Robby Kiger) & Sarah (Anne Marie McEvoy) set out to try & help the stranded couple...Directed by Fritz Kiersch & despite it's bad reputation I actually rather liked Children of the Corn. The script by George Goldsmith is based on a short story (about 15 pages long) by Stephen King, although I have not read it so I cannot compare the two, & while it goes round in circles a bit I though it was effective enough. The film moves along at a nice pace although during the middle not much seems to happen & that's probably where the padding comes in to stretch the film out to 90 odd minutes. I really like the basic story of children turning against adults & setting up their own religion but the film doesn't go into much depth like for instance at the beginning when the children start to kill the adults I was asking myself what could a freaky looking kid say to everyone to get them to murder their parents, alas it is never explained. Neither do we actually get to see 'He Who Walk's Behind the Rows', I guess it's supposed to be some sort of demonic creature as it burrows under the ground. I did like how it builds up & tries to retain some mysterious elements & for some reason Children of the Corn is just one of those films that I enjoyed but don't quite know why, overall in my eyes it just added up to more than the sum of it's parts.Director Kiersch does a good job here & gives the film a great atmosphere of isolation & eeriness, there was just something about the whole idea & notion that unsettled me a little bit I mean any film that can make a corn field seem creepy is doing something right. While Children of the Corn doesn't have fantastic style to it there are some impressive scenes like the opening massacre, when Joesph is run down & it has that nice unique horror feel throughout & I especially like the shots of the children armed with various dangerous looking farming tools like hooks, scythes, pitchforks & machetes. Disappointingly the violence & gore is somewhat restrained with only a few slit throats, some splattered blood, a few stab & cut wounds & a rotten corpse.With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 Children of the Corn is technically an accomplished film with good photography, decent enough special effects although don't expect the latest CGI & it has good solid production values throughout. A special mention for the music by Jonathan Elias which I found particularly good & moody. The acting is pretty good by everyone, Hamilton & Horton do OK & surprisingly the children didn't annoy me as much as child actors usually do & where did they find Malachai & Isaac? They are two freaky & creepy looking kids, well their adults now obviously.I liked Children of the Corn, it seems to get a lot of stick which I can understand I suppose but films are all about personal opinion & I'm going to stand by mine. I think it's definitely worth a watch & at least it's ten times better than the adaptation of King's Graveyard Shift (1990), isn't it?",Children of the Corn
16,utgard14,"""We want to give you peace.""",7,30 October 2013,"Good adaptation of Stephen King short story. This chiller is about a cult of murderous kids in an isolated Nebraska town who worship an unseen evil force that exists in the corn fields, ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows,"" and a young couple that finds themselves in the middle of the eerie goings-on. Peter Horton and the lovely Linda Hamilton star as the ""Outlanders"" and are relatable and likable protagonists. The evil kid cult is led by the mega-creepy Isaac (John Franklin) and his enforcer, the brutish Malachai (Courtney Gains). All of the actors do well, with Franklin and Gains particularly memorable in their performances.I love movies that take place in locales that are different than the usual. I especially love horror films that are shot on location. Some of the creepiest horror films take place in isolated rural areas and small towns. The Children of the Corn makes great use of the desolate lonely cornfields and the seemingly abandoned town.I've been a fan of this film since I was a kid. It has a lot of detractors, probably due to the fact it isn't gory enough or the ending not bleak enough -- two of the main requirements for some horror fans. But I think it's an entertaining atmospheric film with a nice score and some memorable moments and characters.",Children of the Corn
17,grantss,Mediocre adaptation of a Stephen King novel,5,8 November 2015,"Mediocre adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Had great potential. While it was still a ""children go insane, start killing adults"" movie, it was interesting. Then, at a point, the movie moves from thriller- horror to supernatural-horror and it loses all focus and intrigue. After that it is just a random mess.Decent performances by Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton in the lead roles. John Franklin as Isaac provides the unintentional comedic touch: his shrill chipmunky voice and ""respect my authority"" routine had me bursting out laughing on many occasions. Courtney Gains as Malachi was irritating and over-the-top. This performance is probably the single biggest reason why people tend to have a natural dislike for red-headed kids.",Children of the Corn
18,Boba_Fett1138,Not really fast enough or anything interesting happening in this movie really.,5,16 January 2010,"More than halve of the Stephen King adaptations are really disappointing ones. As horror movies they are often lacking and the stories on the silver screen rarely work out as they were intended. ""Children of the Corn"" is one of those disappointing movies. It's nothing too horrible but it's all pretty standard stuff to watch.Thing about this movie is that it just never drags you into it. It's far from a compelling movie that just never succeeds at becoming an interesting one. It's because the storytelling is quite poor at times. The movie has far too many slow moments in it and really not a lot is ever happening in this movie. They could and should had really added some more suspension and action to the movie, in order to make it and its story work out more effectively. In the end we also still have no idea what was going on all in this movie. The story is even more of a mystery at the end than it was at the beginning. It explains absolutely nothing. The many sequels probably do but I don't think a whole lot of people will be interested in those movies anymore after seeing this one.The story and how certain characters react to the situations they are in are far from likely. This is something I often have problems with in Stephen King adaptations. They don't even seem scared or shocked at anything that happens in the movie.It's also pretty simple to me why this movie did not really work out as a creepy or atmospheric one. Blame it on the children. I'm sorry but having this many children as the evil ones in this movie is just not a scary thing. You're just never scared for any of those kids because well, no matter how you look at it they are still kids. Children of course also often are lacking the right acting skills to let their characters work out believable enough, as is the case in this movie.A movie that just doesn't work out too well.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Children of the Corn

But this one was really good. It was scary and atmospheric, all the way through. The music was great, very moody and scary, the basic theme was pretty good, and the acting was, if not great, sufficient. The effects were mostly good, though I thought the moving corn, was, well, corny(no pun intended). It's interesting, all the way through, and has more likable main characters than your everyday horror movie. Both main characters are pretty well developed through the movie, and you actually care about them.

20,view_and_review,This Movie Was Why I Hated Corn Fields,6,18 June 2014,"I just watched Children of the Corn for the first time since 1980-something. How I was allowed to watch such a movie back then I don't know. To be fair, maybe I wasn't allowed and I just found a way to watch it. One thing held true from when I watched it the first time until now: I can't stand Malachai. In fact, Malachai ranks up there with Samara from the Ring as the creepy child that deserved to be erased from existence.Children of the Corn is a movie adaptation of the Stephen King short story of the same name. A band of kids lead by Isaac have killed all of the adults of Gatlin, Nebraska and live only to serve ""the one who walks behind the rows."" After seeing this again I can see some parallels to The Village by M. Night Shayamalan.This was an eerie movie. It wasn't of the slasher type like Halloween or Friday the 13th but more of the scary religious cult type. I don't know where they found Isaac (John Franklin) or Malachai (Courtney Gains) but they were perfect for their roles. Isaac was spooky with an almost adult raspy voice that was still a bit whiny. Malachai was bafugly with his unattractiveness enhanced by his various scowls. They were two adolescents whom you'd figure to be part of a murderous cult.I see they've done a couple of remakes as well as some sequels; all which I haven't seen. This movie was slightly better than OK. There were some typical scary movie clichés and bad music, but other than that it was pretty good.",Children of the Corn
21,neil-476,Serviceable,7,11 February 2014,"Here's a tip. If you are a couple whose marriage is in trouble, it is something of a mistake to drive through the endless cornfields of Nebraska at night and then run somebody down near an apparently deserted town where the locals have a thing for blood sacrifice with a view to aiding crop fertility.Yes, I know I just spoilered the plot, but honestly. This movie - which spawned a franchise of increasingly poor sequels - illustrates the problem with adapting Stephen King to the screen: the story itself, in terms of plot, is serviceable. But the magic comes from the words on the page. King's prose conveys things which movie conversions do not. Oh, the plot works well enough, but it is simple and, dare I say it, filled with cliché. The short story from which it is adapted - ah, well that is another story! Peter Horton and Lina Hamilton are fine as the couple beset with problems, and a nice sense of atmosphere is built up. But, as a viewer who has not read the story or seen the film before - well, I bet you can guess what's going to happen.",Children of the Corn
22,Uriah43,"A Lesson About Messing with ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows""",6,21 April 2020,"This film begins in the small town of Gatlin, Nebraska with a child preacher named ""Isaac"" (John Franklin) ordering the children to band together and murder most of the adults there and with the help of another child named ""Malachi"" (Courtney Gains) this is soon accomplished. The scene then shifts to three years later with a young doctor by the name of ""Burt"" (Peter Horton) and his girlfriend ""Vicky"" (Linda Hamilton) driving through that state on the way to a new job. Momentarily distracted, he doesn't see that a child has walked out from a nearby cornfield right into the path of the car. Unable to react in time the car strikes the child head on before screeching to a halt several yards further. Needless to say, both Burt and Vicky are terrified at what has happened but upon closer examination they discover that the body had been riddled with knife incisions and his throat cut prior to the accident. So after putting the body in the trunk of the car Burt decides to drive to the nearest town to report what had happened. What he doesn't know is that the town he is driving to is Gatlin and that things are about to get much worse for him and Vicky from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie was released during a time when similar films like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" had previously garnered millions of dollars and spawned a number of sequels. It was also released the same year that ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" debuted. So in that context it wasn't quite out-of-the-ordinary by any means. It did, however, have the advantage of being based on a book from Stephen King which guaranteed viewers a certain amount of horror for their time and money. And it's that quality that makes this a good film in and of itself. Admittedly, like most films based on a successful book, there is some dilution but considering the competition at the time this movie turned out to be pretty good and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Children of the Corn
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Weak entry, could've been better",5,13 February 2015,"Driving through the Midwest, a couple stumble upon a deserted town filled with kids worshiping a child prophet claiming to have control of a dangerous creature and must try to stop them before they're part of a town sacrifice.Overall this turned out to be quite a big disappointment. The film's main problem is that it's way too unbelievable to really register, the biggest of which is the fact that it deals with a cult that has acted independently in the town without discovery for three years. This suggests that every single adult who lived in town was related to every other adult who had no relatives that lived out of state. It would've been pretty suspicious when someone from town fails to take a relatives' phone calls, or the power company wouldn't think it kind of odd that every client in the entire town forgot to pay their electric bill all these years. We are further led to believe that the town drops off the face of the map with only one cop going in to investigate, and nobody followed up when they failed to report in. Furthermore, it rests solely on the underlying premise of finding little kids scary, which is the whole purpose for the majority of the chase scenes. For those that don't find this practice scary or chilling, there's little about the kids in here that changes your mind as all they seem to do is run and yell which can be done by just about anybody so it doesn't do anything special with the kids as the main target anyway. The other big flaw in this one is the fact that the opening to this is so incredibly dull and boring that it really takes a lot of effort to get interesting in what's going on in this and is incredibly boring to sit and wait for something to happen. That really makes for a troubling time as this one doesn't have anything worthwhile for a long period of time with this really getting interesting only in the final half. There's some incredibly tense chases through town as the kids pile on after the duo in all the different back-alleys and buildings, which are quite exciting for the most part. The big chase in here also leads to plenty of brawling amongst the two as he has to continually fight them off as the horde grows larger against him which adds to the action as well as giving it some additional suspense. The last good part to this is the finale which is highly exciting due to the rather frenetic paces, fully exciting moments and non-stop spectacle that's a lot better ending than a movie like this deserves. It's all part of what makes the final half so good though none of the segments makes up for it's flaws.Rated R: Violence, Language and heavy themes of child violence.",Children of the Corn

I remember loving it when it was first released, and it really creeped me out. Seeing it now, I just get annoyed as to why Horton didn't just punch every child in the face, and rule the town himself.Isaac stares in glee most of the time, and if he isn't doing that, he's staring into the sky or shouting at the other children. Eg. He's very annoying throughout.Hamilton is the best thing here, but ruins it by singing at the beginning, and although the film doesn't hold up (effects are poor, acting is bad by kids) the first fifteen minutes is still very creepy, although I don't know why they didn't poison the stronger adults.Plus we get a special appearance from the Tremors worm near the end.Another average King adaptation.",Children of the Corn
26,Aaron1375,Some good stuff in the cornfield.,6,11 April 2003,"There are some rather good scenes in this one though it is nothing special. The best scenes are when the kids first go on the rampage and another is when the one kid tries to escape through the cornfield and the corn opens up a lane for him.  For the most part though not too much happens till the end and there isn't much in the way of killings after the two scenes I described.  If you ever read the story though you know that there wasn't much to it so they did an all right job with this movie version.  Though I definitely would not recommend this one be shown to kids like the one poster does.  Not that it would scare them, but to show kids killing parents and being in a cult might not be such a good idea.  Quite a few of the kids in this one look older than what they are portraying in this one.  That isn't too strange though as it is done quite often.  Though the kids that help the two adults who are passing through are most definitely kids, and they do a pretty good job.  This one needed more though to be really good.

Yet it seems abandoned, except for some kids scurrying around. Horror ensues.""Children of the Corn"" (1984) takes the remote Plains town setting of ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971) and gives it a horror spin based on Stephen King's short story. The later ""Husk"" (2011) used the same template. King, however, wasn't pleased with the results, as conveyed in his statement: ""My feeling is like a guy who sends his daughter off to college. You hope she'll do well. You hope she won't fall in with the wrong people. You hope she won't be raped at a fraternity party, which is pretty well what happened to Children of the Corn.""The uninhabited town with scavenging kids makes the film come across as a post-apocalyptic flick. The protagonists are likable and the movie works up some creepy rural mood. People have described the film as sacrilegious, but it's clear that the kids' hybrid religion is not a true expression of Christianity since it's clearly sullied by ""he who walks behind the rows."" One of the picture's criticisms is the ambiguity of this thing, but I suppose enough is revealed to put the pieces together. Still, the lack of exposition is disappointing. And the gaudy effects in the last act are lousy.Another arguable negative is the portrayal of the cult with the use of child & teen actors. I think they did pretty good all things considered. The growing schism between leader Isaac (John Franklin) and chief disciple Malachai (Courtney Gains) is interesting. It's just difficult to portray diabolic cults, like witches and satanists, without getting eye-rolling and laughable.In any case, imagine the casting auditions for Malachai wherein the producers are looking for a tall teenage boy with a mean face and shocking mane. Courtney Gains enters the room and answers some questions when the producers state: ""This is going well; you've just about got it clinched. But, as a formality, could you shout 'Outlander' at the top of your lungs?""The movie runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot mainly in Iowa.GRADE: C+",Children of the Corn
28,The_Void,Another so-so film based on one of Stephen King's books,6,9 June 2005,"Stephen King is often cited to be the father of modern horror, and this view isn't wholly unfounded. King's stories have had a large impact upon the horror genre, and many of them are very good stories in their own right also. However, when it comes to translating King's words onto the screen; many filmmakers have proved that they are not up to the task. I haven't read the book, 'Children of the Corn', but I'm sure it's better than this movie. While the film isn't especially bad; it's hardly a tour de-force of horror cinema either, and like many Stephen King films; this one could have been a hell of a lot better. Actually, this story isn't one of King's better efforts; it follows a small town whose children murder their parents on the instructions of a mysterious preacher; a little kid calling himself Isaac. The story picks up three years after this terrible event when a young couple drive into town for some reason. They find the village completely devoid of adults and it isn't long until they discover what's happened and seek to put an end to it! This film has missed several opportunities, the most glaring of which is the subterranean manifestation that dwells beneath the soil in the cornfields. We get several glimpses of this creature, but we never get to see it properly; and because of this, the monster is about as threatening as a bunch of little kids. Oh wait. Anyway, the film draws parallels with other evil kids films such as Village of the Damned in the way it plays out, but it never really gets out of first gear. While the atmosphere of the town is foreboding and well done on the whole, the plotting isn't very exciting and there's very few moments of real tension or suspense, which ensures the film isn't as engaging as it could have been. The cornfields and the corn that inhabits said field's makes for an unlikely horror prop, and some scenes within the fields are genuinely creepy. The kids themselves are rather well done also, with both of the main ones having good screen presence. If you were to pigeonhole King's films into 'good' and 'bad', this one would firmly be in the latter side. On it's own, however, it's not all that bad, and if you're a fan of King's work, you'll no doubt find something to like here.

The characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable. I just couldn't stop laughing at Issac's voice, it was just like a high pitched whiny girl's British voice. Not to mention Malicai's over dramatic stick up his butt character.Children of the Corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a God that commands them to sacrifice any 20+ aged people. When a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help, but of course they get caught in the kid's trap and are getting sacrificed! But Malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following Issac's orders.Children of the Corn could've been something great, but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of.

With a stupid and brainless grin on his face and his eyes almost popping out of their sockets Amos looks like he just gulped down an entire bottle of Quaalude with a triple shot of LSD as a chaser!***SPOILERS*** As things were soon to turn out the what looked like brain-dead Amos wasn't going to be the only one in the film celebrating his own demise. He'll have Isaac Malachai and the rest of his corn-ball following friends join him. The ""One Behind the Rows"" who Amos & Co. so eagerly and faithfully worshiped was going to make sure of that!",Children of the Corn
36,Robert_duder,Cult classic horror shows how great the cheesy eighties horrors really could be,8,21 March 2008,"In the mid to late nineties I suddenly became completely enamored with the Horror Genre, especially the 70's and 80's and the horror films that spawned sequel upon sequel...no matter how bad...I was a sucker and this was one of my all time favorites. Watching it again years later it didn't have quite the same effect on me but it still holds it's own as a cult classic. First of all you have the benefit of the original short story being written by one of the greatest modern day writers of our time...Stephen King. And although Children of The Corn strays a little from the typical Stephen King recipe there are still a lot of things in tact from his usual genre. Isolation, disturbing religious fanaticism, an unsuspecting hero making a change in his or her life. The idea behind Children of the Corn is just downright disturbing and the portrayals of the children and their twisted world will keep you riveted. They do a terrific job of making sure you understand this strange religion they are involved in but still leave a certain element of mystery to it which is great. The film balances horror with a psychological aspect and despite a low budget and some terrible special effects the film is a classic.Multi talented actor director and producer Peter Horton plays the lead hero in one of his very early roles. Horton is really terrific in the role. He has a certain amount of down to earth quality while still maintaining this touch exterior that makes him a worthy hero. He has this level of intensity to him and he really does a great job. I'm kind of surprised this role didn't gain him more big screen main roles. Probably minutes before changing the world as tough as nails screen hero Sarah Connor Linda Hamilton played the more soft spoken Vicky. We know now what kind of a screen presence she can be and she's kind of underplayed as more of the damsel in distress in this film. Her and Horton are a great couple and have good chemistry and the thing with both of them is that they are very down to earth and very believable. They are just average people in an extraordinary circumstance. John Franklin is kind of the mascot of the series and this film as enraged god-filled Issac. His role is kind of subtle but he's so important and really does make a difference in his role and didn't return to the series until fifteen years later but this first performance was his claim to fame. He fits the role perfectly. Starting a very lucrative career in this first role is Courtney Gains as the deranged killer Malachai. His performance is probably the highlight of the film and is really the true villain since Franklin's character never actually performs any violence against anyone. It's a shame the character of Malachai didn't return in future installments and especially Gains in the role because he was awesome.There were a few things that really make me love this film. First of all the empty town...I love the whole isolation and wiped out apocalyptic feel and they do a good job with small shots of empty stores and such. I also think they do a terrific job with explosions in the film considering the special effects they use for 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows' is simply god awful period. It's terrible...one of the worst effects I've ever seen but it's tolerable since they don't use it a lot. Although apparently not it's original ending I really did like where they went with the ending because it breaks the mold of the typical slasher horror flick where you're practically guaranteed not all of the main characters will live and Children of The Corn actually gives you more of an action film type happy ending and I liked that. Regardless of what some think the film is a cult classic for a reason and I will always fondly remember it as one of my favorites. 8/10",Children of the Corn
37,bowmanblue,A whole new film once you've grown up,7,20 February 2015,"I first watched Children of the Corn when it came out on video in the eighties, when I was roughly the same age of the child stars that were in it. I loved it. Now I've gone and watched it again as an adult - and with children of my own - it's a completely different experience! It's about a small American town in Nebraska where the children kill all the adults and start sacrificing each other to a mysterious god (did I mention it was based on a Stephen King book?). I used to love seeing the children attacking the adults (and no, I wasn't a hooligan, by the way). Now, I just wanted to send every last one of them up to bed and take away their portable DVD players (works every time with my daughter).It's certainly not the best adaptation of a Stephen King book, but it's certainly not the worst either. I guess there's a good half the film spent following the young couple of accidentally stumble across the deserted town, as they wander round trying to work out what we - the viewers - already know.However, what does make it pretty freaky is the lead (evil) children themselves. In recent Hollywood films, children have often been portrayed as the bad guys for added nastiness. Although, for example, just my making a kid's eyes glow red or have them dressed in ghostly clothes, doesn't necessarily make them scary. These kids are the real deal (and continue to freak the hell out of me without any false claws of glowing eyes whatsoever). All they needed was to be ugly enough! One has an extremely bad haircut (even for the eighties) and speaks like South Park's Eric Cartman. The other is like a young, ginger Mick Jagger. Even I would have my doubts about denying these two television privileges! Children of the Corn has sort of stood up to the test of time. If nothing else it's interesting to see Linda Hamilton in a completely different role to her most known part as Terminator's cyborg-killing Sarah Conner. I found the second half of the film more engaging than the first. My advice: if you haven't seen this before and are watching it again for the nostalgia factor, know what you're getting. It's a bit cheesy in places, but still pretty good fun for a film that takes itself very seriously.",Children of the Corn
38,ericstevenson,Corny,5,29 August 2016,"Looking back, I really haven't seen that many Stephen King movies. I'm not going to go through all the work of seeing the miniseries, just his regular feature length movies. The main problem with this film is that it's needlessly padded. There are so many scenes that drag on that just show the characters looking at corn. We never even really get a good idea of what the monster is. Is it actually a manifestation of the corn? This has some of the goofiest scenes I've ever witnessed in a horror movie. We see the monster being represented by a bunch of roots tunneling through the ground. At the end, the monster appears in some weird cartoonish thing.This movie was based on a short story and you can tell. I guess it's hard for me to really hate it, seeing as how it did entertain me with how ridiculous it was. If nothing else, I'll give it credit for starting off a series and it does genuinely seem better than the sequels. This film series actually set a record for most bad entries in any franchise! Seriously, I think there's at least ten bits of material centered on this, probably the most of any Stephen King adaptation. Maybe I'll have to read the story. Isaac is the most entertaining as the zaniest, as pointed out by the Nostalgia Critic. If there's anything legitimately good, it's that the main guy does show some courage at the end. If you have to see this, ignore the sequels. **",Children of the Corn
39,ironhorse_iv,Children of the Corn shucks! This horror movie is too corny.,5,5 March 2016,"Set in the fictitious rural town of Gatlin, Nebraska, the film tells the story of a couple, Burt Stanton (Peter Horton) & Vicky Baxter (Linda Hamilton), getting caught up in a ritually sacrifice murder plot run by the children of the town to ensure a successful corn harvest after years of droughts. This movie had a lot of potential of being a great corn in a cob movie about natural corn killers; instead, the movie fed its audience, chicken feed. What a huge disappointment! I was really looking forward to this movie as a kid. After all, I was a huge fan of 'the bad seed, horror genre'. 1956's Bad Seed, 1960's Village of the Damned, and 1993's The Good Son are some of my favorites. However, this movie really goes against the grain. It wasn't any fun of a great horror popcorn flick. Based upon the 1977 short story of the same name by fame horror author, Stephen King & directed by Fritz Kiersch, the movie was very lackluster. It didn't translate well into film. In my opinion, the awful screenplay is one of the reason, why this movie didn't work. King wrote the original draft of the screenplay, which focused more on the adult characters of Burt and Vicky and depicted more backstory on the uprising of the children in Gatlin; however, this script was disregarded in favor of George Goldsmith's screenplay, which featured more violence and a more conventional narrative structure. Because of this change, we don't see, how the children of this town, got tempt by this malevolent entity, that they call God, nor how they were able to maintained and keep themselves, isolated from the rest of the world. Here is a bigger question, what was the reason, they felt, the lone mechanic (R. G. Armstrong) around? I get that, maybe, they keep him around to help run the machines for the harvest, and help isolate themselves, from outside visitors, but it doesn't make sense in a plot sense, because, their God AKA 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows', stated out, that all adults in their town, must die, or he will lower the age to 18, rather than 19. Plus, he wasn't there in the original source material. The movie also starts off awkwardly, with all of the adult figures, being killed off. It's felt like we jump into the third act, without knowing it. In my opinion, I would rather have, the mystery of the child getting ran over, opening from the source material over this. It builds more suspense. Since the movie has large story gaps, it's not very well-paced. Lots of slow and dull moments. It was not flesh out enough. Another thing, I didn't like, about this movie is the main good child, Job (Robby Kiger). He reads the narrative, with seemingly no emotional reaction. A good example of this, is when he talks about his father being killed right in front of him. Also, for a character that is supposedly, very smart. He does a lot of stupid decisions, like shouting out, when people are able to escape. His sister, Sarah (Annie Marie McEvoy) is just as stroppy. She gives no emotional side of trauma, as well. Nor, does she ever seem to be in fear of her life. I also hate the fact, that her character started drawing pictures that predict the future, without any backstory. The two adult leads, are also pretty bland as well. Peter Horton looks and acts like director Michael Bay. His character has a very offensive and fake-looking attitude, when it comes to him looking for action. It's pretty lame, how easily, he can escape from these maniac teenagers. For Linda Hamilton, it's very jarring to see her, play the damsel in distress after last, seeing her, play a semi good heroic in 1984's Terminator. It's sad to see, that her character, here, doesn't really add, anything to the movie. Anyways, their action scenes, together, barely counts as thrilling. I really find the movie, very weird that it's Rated R, yet, most of the deaths, are not really gory, or graphic. The camera always seem to cut away. Another fault of the movie is the lame, and not frightful, jump scare. They mostly pointless, nor make any sense. A good example is the kid's dead body scene. It's a bit odd, for her to know, in detail, what the kid look like, when she didn't see the body, at all. Even, the anti-climactic ending was bad. The movie ends so abrupt. I would rather have, the tragic yet, somewhat bitter sweet ending of the book over this, any day. If there was anything scary about this movie, it wouldn't be the dated, special effects in this film as well. It wasn't impressive at the time, and it sure, hasn't aged well, since then. It looks like radioactive VHS static. The creature toward the end of the film, also looks like a recycle copy of the Master Control Program (MCP) character from 1982's computer fantasy, Tron. The only thing, that was somewhat good, about this film is how menacing, the then-25 year old, John Franklin as the cult lead, Isaac Chroner was. He really save the movie, with his chewing of the scenes. Courtney Gains as his second in command, Malachai Boardman, also deserves credit. He was foreboding, most of the film. Overall: While, this movie was badly made. It did started a thread of sequels and remakes, hoping to capitalize on Stephen King's name. As of this writing, eight sequels have since been produced, and a 2009 remade, TV Movie was filmed. In the end, I felt like this movie could had been better. It's not the worst Stephen King movie, I ever saw, but it's not even, near the best. It's just disappointing. Not a-maize-ing. Let's hope, in the future, somebody can tackle, the source material in making a film with some respect.",Children of the Corn
40,Platypuschow,Children of the Corn: Not the epic I expected,4,12 June 2018,"1984 was an amazing year for movies, being the nerd that I am I pay attention to my analytics and 1984 is the 3rd greatest movie year at time of writing.Being a huge horror fan the fact I haven't watched the Children Of The Corn movies is remarkable especially when you take into consideration how much I love Kings work and how I've seen every other adaptation of his books.Off the top of my head I've seen the remake (2009) and one of the later sequels and have to say (And I never say this) the remake is better. Being that this is the original cult classic I expected so much more but instead found a disjointed lifeless effort that failed to impress.I'm not saying it's bad, but its mediocre at best.

It quite honestly is nothing more than sacrilege from beginning to end. Linda Hamilton's presence in the film was a big bonus, and Peter Horton allowed for some eye candy. They were both very good in the film and I rooted for them all the way.

43,Dr_Coulardeau,The Corn God wants his cup of blood everyday,8,25 October 2019,"I read the short story a long, very long time ago. Short stories for Stephen King are a good genre when he wants to have density, a swift and rapid plot, simple characterization. His normal genre requires hundreds of pages, at times many hundred pages and one thousand is not an unreachable goal for him. This short story has had a very special history since from a short story adapted to the screen as a normal long feature film, it then developed into so many sequels and more recently even a TV series, that I turned curious and wanted to see what all that was about. So, I am going to follow the tracks of those perverse children and see where it is going. It is not the only case of a novel or short story by Stephen King becoming a whole set of adaptations with sequels and further developments using the same characters and situations. At the same time Stephen King is not the only author who is that successful with film and TV series makers, though the most famous series of films in that line, I mean Nosferatu, Dracula, Tarzan (this last one seems to have gone out of business in more recent years if not decades), or Frankenstein, can spread over a century or so and are more centered on the character himself, and adventures or developments that have little to do with the original piece of literature. In the field of action films, there are some that can never end, even if the main actor retires or just dies. Then a substitute can start a new batch. The most typical character in that line is James Bond, and we could think of Terminator too that seems to never come to an end with or without Schwarzenegger.So, let's start this exploration.Stephen King - Children of the Corn - 1984This first film adaptation is based on the short story with the same title published in the March 1977 issue of Penthouse and later collected in King's 1978 collection Night Shift. It officially takes place in Nebraska, some out of the way corn growing village, or small town. The plot is simple. Under the guidance of some young teenager all the young people under 18 in the town decide on one Sunday morning after service in the local church to put to sleep in a very bloody way all the people over 18.A cult then is instigated and when a young person reaches the age of 18, he or she is sacrificed to their Corn God after sharing his blood with the members of the congregation. Of course, music, games, dancing, anything trendy or fancy is banned. A couple of kids, it looks like three at the beginning, but one is caught when trying to escape, are apparently living underground in some basement where a father had established some shelter for any emergency.The situation explodes after the one who tried to escape is caught up and executed when a doctor and his wife are going through the ghost city and get caught in the maze or net of the cult? Since they are outlanders, they have to be caught and sacrificed in the cornfields in a reenactment of the crucifixion of Jesus, slightly modernized, but this time a crucifixion to honor and pacify, to feed in a way, the Corn God. I can't help thinking of the Maya Maize God who required quite some blood self-sacrifices and human sacrifices to guarantee a good harvest every year, and durable social harmony the rest of the time. But the crucifixion and the quotation of the Bible are at least a Christianization of the good old Maya ritualistic practice.At the same time, the setting being essentially roads and houses surrounded by enormous cornfields, we are projected into the corn belt in its absolutely excessive and irrational mono-cultivation of corn. So, the perversion of these fields seems to also tell us something about the American society and the violation of the earth that such mono-cultivation of one single crop is. Nature, Gaia as she is called in Oxford, Mother Nature as many Native Americans would call her, and then it definitely is a female character for them, is more or less getting even with humanity for raping her in such a way.A subterranean monster, that we never see, is controlling the situation and both gulping down the sacrificed ones and protecting the community against any outlander. Luckily there are some interesting special effects for that part of the monstrous advancing under the skin of the earth like some lice. But it is easy, so they say, to get rid of this monster: burn the field of corn in which it is sheltering itself and it will disappear in thin air like a fistful of ashes. And that's exactly what happens. But apparently the monster had enough time to take care of the main leaders, at least, of this community and only two kids who had escaped by living as I have said in a basement shelter, are still shown as alive with the doctor and his wife. And they only have 19 miles to walk to the next city in order to report the situation because of course there are no functioning telephones and the doctor's car had been cornified, meaning turned into a wreck by filling every section and part that was slightly hollow with corn leaves or anything corny available. In other words the car was sent to corn paradise.The film is good as for the rhythm but in a way, it is slightly sketchy on details. It is also funny, not strange at all but definitely ah-ah, to see the rivalry between the 12-13 year old prophet and his main 16-17 year old power assistant who tried and succeeded, for a while, to dethrone the prophet, have him crucified on a rockety corn-cob-cross and seize power, probably because his 18th birthday was coming and that would have been the end of his existence, even though it was a very sorry existence.The next film tomorrow.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Children of the Corn
44,filipemanuelneto,"Far from being a good movie, but I thought it would be much worse.",4,27 December 2020,"I saw this movie recently and I was unimpressed. I have seen many adaptations of Stephen King's short stories, and this film is not among the best. However, it also didn't seem as bad as many people say. It has some redeeming qualities that must be taken into account. Perhaps it contributed to becoming a film with some notoriety, even after several disastrous sequels.The film is based on a short story by King about a small rural town, where everything revolves around growing corn. One day, in 1980, inspired by the fiery preaching of a teenager recently arrived in the city called Isaac, the local children unite and massacre the adults, their parents and family members, in order to please an evil and diabolical deity they call ""The One Who Walks Behind the Rows"". And from there, the city dies, and so do those who get there. It was what would happen to a young couple who gets lost and finds the city by chance, but they will have the help of two children from the city, unhappy with the direction of the situation.Well, I don't know if it's really worth saying that logic isn't the film's strong point. It does not make sense for a city, however small, to suffer such a calamity and that is not front-page news, with an invasion of police, armed to the teeth, to hunt down the sect. It is best to accept the film as it is and not think too much about the story or everything will fall apart. One of the things that pleased me most is the way the film begins: through the voice of one of the children, we witnessed the horror of the massacre, with the refinement of cruelty. It is one of the most striking scenes in the film, and it introduces very well what will follow. The film is effective in the task of creating an atmosphere of tension and surrounding suspense, but it spoils it as it progresses and the film becomes more exaggerated. The ending is histrionic and uninteresting.The film has a cast that we can divide into adults and children. The overall performance is average, but there is no actor who truly shines or stands out for his good work. This is largely due to the poor direction of Fritz Kiersch and the fact that the characters are basic, without any development. Most children did not have much to do. John Franklin is greasy and slippery, but never truly threatening, Courtney Gains is more effective at this task; Robby Kiger and Anne Marie McEvoy are sweet, pleasant and easy to like; Jonas Marlowe and Julie Maddalena do nothing more than is essential. When it comes to adults, Linda Hamilton steals the spotlight whenever she appears and the reason is clear: she is beautiful and convincing in the role of the lady in danger, but she does nothing but be in danger, appear scared and run away. R. G. Armstrong did a good job on a character that comes up briefly, and it gives us perhaps the closest thing to a well-done dramatic interpretation. Peter Horton has not convinced me and has scenes that are absolutely inconceivable.Technically it is a rather poor film, and it should certainly not be the fault of the time it was made. There were already better features and special effects than those used here. Really, the film has horrible special effects, the best and most creative being that pile of earth that runs from side to side and, supposedly, is the evil creature that lives in the corn and the children deified. There is little blood in the film (in certain scenes there should be more to make it more credible) and the deaths are not graphic, but they shock more by what is implied than by what is actually seen.",Children of the Corn
45,BaronBl00d,A-Maize-Ingly Bad?,3,24 December 2004,"Children of the Corn is an obvious example of what happens when film makers take a short story and turn it into a feature length film. With very few exceptions, the almost inevitable result is a film with major script problems. Children of the Corn has such major script problems. A young couple driving on their way to a new home accidentally hit a child standing in the middle of the road amidst corn fields on all sides. The couple stops and sees what they can do, realize the child is dead, and look for help. Eventually they realize the nearby town is completely void of any adult population. Strange corn crucifixes and husks of corn are all over the place. Then things get ugly... I liked the concept behind the film of the kids having ""taken"" control, but I had major problems with its execution. The hokey explanation at the end just does not satisfy me. Why was Issac the way he was? By the way the kid with the adult-like face playing Issac was indeed creepy. The kid playing Malachai was more annoyingly inept rather than creepy. How did the kid with the suitcase in the beginning, after having his throat sliced, manage to walk and STAND in the middle of the highway just as the car was careening down the road? I have many other like questions. This film for its time has some violent scenes. Perhaps the most violent is the first scene in the flashback of what happened three years ago at the very beginning of the film. In that scene an adult helps the children with their mission...what happens to her later? The empty streets of Gatlin, Nebraska are effective in creating much of the mood in this film. Actors Peter Horton and lovely Linda Hamilton as the couple do a competent job, and Robby Kiger as a ""good"" kid named Job excels, but the plot for this film is just too ridiculous. We see the sky inexplicably darken and wind manifest itself. We get no explanation really for anything. I am amazed that something so superficially bald in storyline has fostered at least two theatrically released sequels and at least four video sequels. (Now, that is AMAZING!)

The fact that I have watched this movie on purpose multiple times speaks to something I guess. I am drawn to folk horror and Children Of The Corn is America's effort at Heartland Folk Horror in an era marked by an accelerating death of family farms due in large part to the aggressively state-sponsored consolidation and spread of big agribusiness. I suspect what Children Of The Corn is really about is the uprooting of traditional rural civic religious traditions in the face of a rising theocratic movement which has continued unchecked, fueled and abetted by the same destabilizing massive business interests which brought Monsanto and Wal-Marts to small towns everywhere.In the 1980's, an explosion could solve any problem, no matter what it was. The greater the explosion, the more problems were being solved. That was a surety! Unfortunately its productive application outside of the 1980's has been less successful. Perhaps it is the decline in ritual post-explosion jocular banter, previously seen as a needless formality, which ensures the positive outcome of large explosions?

55,kirbylee70-599-526179,Back to the Beginning,7,5 October 2017,"When CHILDREN OF THE CORN was released I was working as a theater manager in Indianapolis. I had access to most movies coming out, was an avid fan of horror films and when I couldn't see them that way would rent them since this was the early age of the VCR. When I heard that a new movie was coming out based on a Stephen King novel I looked forward to it, expected to be chilled to the bone. The end result was entertaining but not quite that frightening.The story opens with a town in which all of the young people for reasons as yet unexplained kill off the adults. They do so at the behest of Isaac (John Franklin), a holy roller styled child preacher. Fast forward to several years later was young couple Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) are on their way to Burt's new job as a doctor. Driving through the fields of corn they hit a young boy standing in the middle of the road. Burt realizes he didn't die from the accident but from a slit throat so the couple go searching for help.They find themselves directed to the tiny town of Gatlin with its empty streets and corn stalk filled cars and stores. Eventually they come across two small children, our movie narrators, who don't tell them much. When the rest of the youth find them they capture Vicky and plan to offer her as a sacrifice. Will Peter be able to rescue her? Will he discover what is actually going on in this town? And will the evil that has been behind it all be revealed? Based on a short story the plot is fairly simple and the story here is as well. It involves a lot of moving from one place to another and listening to two factions in the town struggling with one another: Isaac the long term leader who has controlled it from the beginning and the devout follower Malachi (Courtney Gains) who thinks things haven't gone far enough. Their struggle is as menacing to watch as is the deaths they've perpetrated and now prepare for.The acting here is what one would expect from two pros like Horton and Hamilton. Both were well on their way to stardom when making this film, he on TV's THIRTYSOMETHING and she in the TERMINATOR films. What makes this movie stand out though is the performances of the young people involved. Franklin (although older than he looks) is the perfect fit for the character of Isaac. And Gaines looks like the local skateboard teen who could be trouble but in this case carrying a butcher knife and proving that he is.For being a horror film as well as one with an R rating there is very little in the way of blood or gore here and no nudity at all which makes one wonder why the MPAA would choose to pass this off with that rating. In the extras even the producers were stunned by the rating which was given without any explanation as to how to fix it. In any event, fans of the film and of Stephen King will want to pick this one up.That being said with a blu-ray edition out earlier why would anyone pick up this one? Two words: Arrow Video. Yes, I'm still singing their praises. The quality of the picture here is fantastic with a gorgeous transfer. The extras are very numerous and include a brand new audio commentary track with horror journalist Justin Beahm and CHILDREN OF THE CORN historian John Sullivan, an audio commentary track with director Fritz Kiersch, producer Terrence Kirby and actors Franklin and Gaines, HARVESTING HORROR: THE MAKING OF CHILDREN OF THE CORN a retrospective piece on the film full of interviews, AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD THEM a brand new interview with actors Julie Maddalena and John Philbin, IT WAS THE EIGHTIES! an interview with Linda Hamilton, FIELED OF NIGHTMARES a brand new interview with writer George Goldsmith, RETURN TO GATLIN a brand new featurette revisiting the film's original Iowa locations, STEPHEN KING ON A SHOESTRING an interview with producer Donald Borchers, WELCOME TO GATLIN: THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF CHILDREN OF THE CORN an interview with production designer Craig Stearns and composer Jonathan Elias, CUT FROM THE CORNFIELD an interview with actor Rich Kleinberg on the infamous lost Blue Man scene, DISCIPLES OF THE CROW a 1983 short film adaptation of the original King story, a storyboard gallery, the original trailer and a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.

56,drownnnsoda,So-So Stephen King Adaptation.,6,22 September 2006,"Based on Stephen King's short novel, ""Children of the Corn"" is a fairly underrated horror film. The film begins with a peaceful Sunday morning at a small-town coffee shop. Everyone has gotten out of church, and enjoying their breakfast and coffee. But wait! A group of creepy children approach the diner, and the waitress poisons the coffee. The kids storm in, slashing and hacking all the adults in the shop, leaving one small boy in the midst of bloody corpses. We then cut to present day, where a couple, Bert and Vicky (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) are driving through isolated Nebraska. While driving, a young boy (who was just attacked when trying to escape his town) runs into the road, clutching his throat. Bert slams on the brakes, but it's too late, and they hit the poor kid. He's obviously dead, so they put him in the trunk and after trying to find a larger city, they resort to the empty ghost town of Gatlin for help. Little do they know, there is a psychotic brainwashed cult of adult-hating children who worship ""he who walks behind the rows""...I found the story for this film, based on King's short novel, to be actually pretty interesting. Corn fields are a little eerie to begin with, but they're even creepier when they're hiding a group of scythe-wielding little murderous kids who belong to a bizarre, adult-butchering cult. The opening scene of the film (the coffee shop massacre) is brilliant, and goes down on my list of classic horror scenes. The movie from there on is pretty atmospheric and eerie, initializing scenes of the child cult conducting numerous rituals and the innocent young couple having trouble in the isolated countryside. These scenes are spooky and atmospheric.The cinematography here is nice and the natural eeriness of corn fields is captured well, but a complaint would be the extremely fake-looking special effects displayed in the final act of the movie, they are really laughable, and the lack of scares this film delivers. It really could have been creepier, and I felt it was a little flat in that respect. Aside from that though, the movie was visually good. The acting is pretty decent, Barton and Hamilton both gave worthy performances, and John Franklin (who plays the leader of the cult, Isaac) is one creepy looking little guy (as he is conveyed in the movie at least). And there are plenty of gore scenes and neat little touches to the film that should please most horror fans.Overall, ""Children of the Corn"" is a decent movie. It's not perfect and surely has it's flaws, but all things considered, it's pretty entertaining and has some good things to offer for the genre. This film seems to have been getting some bad reviews, but I don't think it's all so bad. Definitely see it if you're a fan of Stephen King. 6/10.",Children of the Corn

I remember seeing this film as a child. I thought this film was extremely creepy and scary as well. But watching this today as an adult, u could see their flaws on this ambitious film. Good performances by the cast saved it from being an complete disaster. This is an well directed film with some strong moments of violence but falls apart in the third act. Even Stephen King was disappointed with the adaptation of his short story. This had some controversies, when the picture was out. The scenes, where kids are murdering adults in the movie but it's done so tastefully that the director made it suggestive instead. Some of the dialogue is unintentional funny as well. But the film went on have Six Sequels! (""Children of the Corn 3"" is actually quite good, however) and this picture went on to have an major cult following over 20 years is been out.DVD from Anchor Bay is the 20th anniversary edition. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine, digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an fine sometimes humorous commentary track by the director, producer and actors:Franklin & Gains. DVD also has fascinating featurette with interviews by the director & two cast members, original theatrical trailer, poster & still gallery and more. Although i would love to hear production stories by Horton and Hamliton but they are probably embarrassed with this campy/cult classic. This film also has an memorable music score by Johathan Elias (Pathfinder ""2007"", Shakedown, Vamp). Still, it was one of the most bizarre movies to come out in the early 1980's. Die Hard fans of King's work will certainly find some amusement here and others should beware. Not for all tastes. (*** ½/*****).",Children of the Corn
59,gcd70,"Cheap, average horror show",4,15 January 2008,"I must admit, ashamed though I am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's frightening story however I have now come to my senses, and am able to assess Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably.Indeed King's tale of a small Nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid. A lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the finale into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare.The cast are reasonable, but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible, over the top movie will allow them, and the soundtrack by Jonathan Elias is spookier than the pictures.A real shame that George Goldsmith's screenplay turned Stephen King's haunting short story into a shocking horror.

60,dworldeater,"Cults, cornfields and killer children, oh my!",7,22 October 2017,"Children Of The Corn is a somewhat dated, but still enjoyable Steven King adaptation delivered on a low budget. This is driven by a good score and intense performances by John Franklin and Courtney Gains respectively as cult leader Issac and heavy henchman Malachi. Children Of The Corn has a pretty solid story and has some great atmosphere. Performances are decent, but for the most part not the best. Some of the special f/x are downright horrible. This however does'nt work against the film and plays as campy entertainment. This also features an early performance from Linda Hamilton who will next star in another classic, James Cameron's Terminator. John Franklin is a great villain and gives a very creepy but classy performance. Courtney Gains is also effective as a badass brute force and has some great hair that embodies the power of true metal. I can not comment on the book or the sequels, but the film holds up pretty good and was a hit at the box office when it was released theatrically.

62,Samiam3,Mildly entertaining idiocy,6,11 May 2010,"The Corn is as high as an elephant's eye....or so it has been sung. It can also be as low as an elephant's toe.Although it is pretty easy to argue that Children of the Corn is low (what with it being unscary, unholy and epically unintelligent) it is not necessarily unwatchable. This is one of those B-grade features that gets away with being 'amusing' if nothing else. The town of Gatlin, Nebraska is over run by religiously psychotic children, who kill anyone who enters town. They have been doing this for the last three years, since that one day when they killed all their parents. Three years later, at the (literal) height of the corn season, Dr. Burt and his girl Vicky are lost on the Nebraska highway trying to their destination. After a couple of bizarre encounters, they end up in Gatlin, and they are about to learn its deadly secrets.As is the case with much of King's work, This story is extremely subversive toward the church, which affects the screenplay a bit by making some of the dialogue very hokey. Rather than getting annoyed however, I was kind of able to laugh at it (not out loud of course). Children of the Corn, actually got me to care a bit for (some) of the people. Burt and Vicky are nice, quirky folks, not the kind of people you wanna see get bumped off. About 90% of horror films make protagonists out of idiotic teens or post teens. This was especially true during the eighties with the rise of such works as Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, (plus their sequels). If I had to guess what most people have against Children of the Corn, in addition to it's anti- Christian stupidity, it would be the film's lack of atmospheric subtlety. Children of the Corn sometimes feels like it came out of the 1950's back when large chase scenes were supposed to be scary and the presence of evil came with a blare of music. (here it is a children's choir). There is nothing particularly scary about the kids, once we see them (and we see them almost right away). They are just kids with sickles and knives, and their strength in numbers doesn't necessarily make them any more intimidating. Well, you can love it or you can hate it, but you won't know until you try. I'm not necessarily suggesting that you do.

The murderous machinations of these half-pint, hate-spewing, parent slaying, corn-fed cultists made quite the deep impression on my only moderately more infantile teenaged, terror-soaked mind, and now seen through 'adult' eyes, this tightrope-tense, surprisingly brutal 80s horror harvest has lost very little of its skin-crawlingly creepy charm, since director Fritz Kiersch's blood-soaked field of screams still offers up a calamitous cornucopia of gruesome, scythe slashing nastiness from these Satanically tripped-out terror tykes!",Children of the Corn
64,brando647,A Mediocre Adaptation from the Master of the Macabre...,5,6 April 2008,"In my opinion, this is one of the more mediocre Stephen King adaptations to ever make it to the big screen. The film is based on a 30 page short story King published in his 'Night Shift' anthology. The story revolves around the town of Gatlin, Nebraska, where the children have formed a cult worshiping a deity who lives among the cornfields. As a result, the children have all been driven to murder every adult in town at the whim of Isaac (John Franklin), the leader of the children and the one who acts as a prophet for the corn-god. Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton play a couple who stumble across the desolate, cursed town.The story itself plays out nicely, but since it is adapted from a mere 30 pages, George Goldsmith must have had his hands full drawing it out to last 90 minutes. It does tend to slow down a bit in the first and second acts and I was left wishing something would happen to advance the story. There's a long period where we follow Burton (Horton) and Vicky (Hamilton) as they wander around searching for a phone. Once the third act kicks in, the pace quickens and I was drawn back into the story.Surprisingly enough, for a movie where the bulk of the cast is child actors, the performances weren't that bad. It's not often that I see decent acting out of children (I still resent Jake Lloyd for his performance as Anakin Skywalker). John Franklin did a great job as the demented corn-god prophet, giving a stern performance without going too over-the-top. Courtney Gains seemed to ham it up a bit as Malachai, Isaac's enforcer, but it was never annoying. For some reason, the kid kind of reminded me of Hugo Weaving at some points...The real weak spot for the film is it's CGI. Keep in mind, the film only had a 3 million dollar budget. So, while the CGI seemed weak (even by 1984 standards), it was the best they could do on their budget. The corn-god's final wrath-fest looked like something out of an OLD arcade game and weakened the overall effect of it all. It's hard to feel tension with graphics like that portraying this ""powerful"" being.The movie does suffer a bit in pace and appearance but it still makes for an overall decent movie. Hamilton and Horton turn in good enough performances and the kids do a fantastic job. While it doesn't seem all that scary to modern crowds, I'm sure it was a great thriller in its time and it's worth a viewing.",Children of the Corn
65,moviewizguy,An adult nightmare.,5,10 August 2009,"Young lovers on a cross-country trip stop in a small Nebraska community and make a shocking discovery. One day, three years prior to the couples' arrival, the town's children killed all of the grown-ups at the apparent behest of a demon simply dubbed ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows."" Based on a short story from horror scribe Stephen King's ""Night Shift"" collection, this film spawned a slew of bloody sequels.I was ready. I was ready to give this a 1 on a 10 star scale and an F on the letter grading scale. I almost came that close into giving the film that rating. The first few scenes in the film was absolutely atrocious. I wanted to cut my eyes out and wanted to wish I were deaf rather than hear some of the worst dialogue ever written in man kind. However, Linda Hamilton came onto the screen. She made the picture bearable. I wanted more of her and her husband, played by Peter Horton, and much less of the children.Sadly, this movie is as much about the kids as it is about the couple getting terrorized by these kids. This is a bad thing because the filmmakers got some of the worst child actors to have played these villains, with an exception of Robby Kiger and AnneMarie McEvoy. On top of that, the film takes so much time setting up everything. In fact, it's not until the 55 minute mark where something finally happens, but this is so very unfortunate because the movie is about 93 minutes long. If my calculations were correct, the film spent about 60% of the time setting up. That is a long time.However, there are some good news to this story. Right after the 55 minute mark, where things really start to happen, there comes a miracle: The movie is actually pretty funny, in a corny, campy way. Hell, even the last scene had me rolling on the floor laughing. It's CLASSIC. But this brings me to another problem: The film doesn't know whether to be a demonic child horror flick or a campy B-movie. It has some sort of bipolar disorder. Since I obviously didn't get scared by the ""scary"" scenes in the film with the ""scary"" kids, I really wished the film was a full on campy B-movie.If there's anything ""good"" to say about the film, I really enjoyed the last few minutes of the film and for that, the film isn't the worst film I've ever seen. However, there are many unintentional funny scenes in here as well, with some not-so-good performances by most of the kids and a lot of atrocious dialogue along with a laughable plot. It's not as horrible as I had expected but it wasn't really good either. It is a cult classic, so it has something going for it. For me, it was too little, too late.",Children of the Corn

The movie is a much more ""standard"" horror flick, and there are some unintentionally goofy moments:  He Who Walks Between the Rows burrowing through the fields like Bugs Bunny comes to mind.  And the feel-good ending makes you want to throw up.  But unlike its successors, the original CotC is still a chilling little flick, keeping the best elements of the King short story.

This film is a stinker!",4,5 October 2005,"Children of the Corn is one of many Steven King stories that has not been translated into a good movie. How on Earth did this little 3 million dollar monstrosity generate so many sequels? Our story centers around a young couple (Horton & Hamilton) who stumble across a rural town where children have taken over and killed off all the adults. The children are led by a self-styled boy preacher named Isaac, who ordered all adults to be killed three years earlier. The children practice some strange new religion that has something to do with a demonic being who lurks out in the nearby cornfields. Once a child reaches their 18th birthday, they are sacrificed to this god known as ""he who walks behind the rows."" It's up to this young couple to break the young preacher's spell and fight off his top assassin known as ""Malachai"".After a very creepy and effective beginning in which we see a café of adults butchered and poisoned by some of the kids, the film quickly gets mired in poor pacing, wooden acting, and terrible effects. The film is talky, and the technical goofs are easy to spot. The film is so poorly paced, that it's hard to distinguish an actual climax toward the end. A poorly filmed explosion in a cornfield is all we get. With a budget so small, the filmmakers would have been better served to create some type of final battle between only the human characters. Those effects really looked terrible.I would have also liked to learn more about the religion these kids practiced. There are some Satanic-looking images, defamation of Christian paintings, and corn husks strewn all over the place. But we the audience are left to guess as to what exactly that thing is out in the cornfield.Though it takes place in our beloved state of Nebraska, it was actually filmed along the I-29 corridor of northwestern Iowa. Why is this significant? I don't know. It's just an interesting point of trivia. Children of the Corn has a few recognizable faces in it. Linda Hamilton had not yet hit the big time, and neither had Peter Horton. Courtney Gains has gone on to have a pretty good career, and R.G.

Let's focus on the good things first.A young couple travels across the U.S. Suddenly, they hit what looks like a boy. When they return and examine the kid, they discover that the kid was murdered in the corn fields. They take the kid to the nearest town, Gatlin, where they discover that something has gone horribly wrong ads they found that the adults have disappeared, and the children act really strange.No doubt it's a good premise, having children as the evil was done previously in ""Village of the Damned"", but here it's to the next level by having the children killing the adults following the orders of a bizarre religious preacher. It's like ""Village of the Damned"" meets ""The Wicker Man"".Sadly, the movie never turns that good. The good parts are, the amazing score used in the movie, it's very haunting and eerie. It goes well with the subject and the atmosphere of the town. That is something which also deserves recognition. The choosing of the location was excellent and the crew knew how to give the town the atmosphere of isolation and mystery the film demanded. Too bad the director could not manage the actors as good as he did with the crew.The acting for the most part is bad; although John Franklin, in the character of the creepy preacher Isaac deserves credit for giving the best acting in the movie. And maybe of the entire series.For the most part the movie is average, but in the ending it falls apart when it breaks the atmospheric tone it was using and goes for an ending that the low-budget SFX could not afford.To summarize, it's a movie that will give you entertainment if you don't expect too much, and the great score and the acting of John Franklin may worth the rent.6/10",Children of the Corn

In Children of The Corn we get a travelling couple Vicky (Linda Hamilton) and Burt (Peter Horton) stumbling across a deserted town where all the adults have been murdered and the kids are responsible and they follow a weird cult leader in the cornfields where the truth is explained. The eerie silence throughout this movie is rather unnerving and very effective, I really rather quite enjoyed this movie, the atmosphere was spot on and the suspense and characters really makes this movie work, but there are a few flaws, like there aren't enough kill scenes which isn't a terrible thing and this movie does feel a bit overlong and dragged out. But the inclusion of the final battle scene was a real highlight and is what really lifts this movie up into a whole different direction.The cast were really good John Franklin as Isaac was really creepy and scary and Malachi played by Courtney Gains was really sick and twisted. Linda Hamilton is a pre fame role displays true ability in her role and a character that you can relate too and Peter Horton also does well as the unlikely hero but does make some rather stupid mistakes.All in all ""Children of the Corn"" is an effective and creepy movie that makes it a decent horror movie, just don't bother with the endless stream of sequels.",Children of the Corn

It's an effectively scary horror film, especially in it's first five minutes, when a number of adults are massacred by sharp implements, what have you in a cafe by a religious cult, where if you're over 18, it's fatal. One old guy they don't kill, funnily enough. happens to be an old gas station owner. Yuppie couple (Hamilton and Horton, so surpassed by the much better performances of the kids, the kid who plays the cult leader, Issac, is brilliant) happen to be traveling down the wrong highway. They end up going around in circles, then hit a kid, a traitor of the cult, running from these evil doers, (the different angled shots of the cornfields are masterfully shot here) who jumps out onto the road, before them. Only their real troubles are just beginning. This is one of very few King novels to film that successfully work, two other ones that worked effectively were Cujo and Pet Sematary to some extent. Here is a real scare fest, especially when you consider the concept, which has you unconsciously imagining, ""What if?"" There are some ugly moments, none more than in it's start, where at the time, it had me wondering how it escaped an R rating. There are some nifty shock moments, that had me jumping, in it's first view, where this successful king horror maintains suspense, all the way.

The one scene where he's staring into the diner before they go on their killing spree was really chilling but other than that there's nothing scary here. I thought the two youngest kids actually acted better than the leads. The little boy had some great lines that you will miss if you're not paying close attention. When the Isaac character is on the corn cross and screams as he's being taken by ""he who walks behind the rows"" or whatever was so high pitched and out of character for how he was acting up to that point that I was cracking up.

It was sooo NOT scary - it was HIGH-LAR-E-US! And wow! Special effects sure have come a long way since this film!! When the corn field is burning and you see the smoke billowing up and whatever evil was in there was portrayed by what looked like someone was drawing on the actual screen? Awesome! It was so bad it was good! Oh and how many people would drive into an obviously abandoned creepy town and not squeal their tires peeling out of there?!

81,jhaggardjr,Weird horror flick,4,19 September 2000,"""Children of the Corn"" is an unusual horror film from a Stephen King story. It's about a young couple who stumble into what looks like a ghost town in Nebraska. What they don't know (but soon find out) is that it's a town inhabited by murderous children who killed all the adults three years earlier, and any adults that find their way into this town are slaughtered on the spot by the evil kids. This is a ridiculous premise, to say the least, but there are some moments of sheer terror (especially the opening scene). Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton play the couple who make the big mistake of driving into this god-awful village. This is a movie that both Horton and Hamilton probably wish they never made. One excuse is that they were basically unknowns when they made this. But since this film they've gone on to bigger and better things. Horton starred on TV's ""Thirtysomething"", and Hamilton's next movie was the original ""Terminator"". Hamilton would later follow that up with the sequel ""T2"", ""Dante's Peak"", her own TV series ""Beauty and the Beast"", and a husband in ""Terminator"" director James Cameron (they divorced shortly after Cameron's monster hit ""Titanic"" won 11 Oscars). Both actors rarely make an impression here, and neither does the young actors with play the children. Except for the two good children who befriend the couple. They're too cute.

82,baileycrawly,Major Flop,3,14 May 2020,"Children of the Corn is, in short, a mediocre film based on a mediocre short story from best-selling author and literary legend Stephen King. It's a visual retelling of his short story that stretches every single solitary detail to the point that it's out of proportion, offering a story far enough removed from the already-abysmal story, and yet still failing to improve on a single aspect of it.Part of it can be brought down to the low budget, which isn't a particularly sufficient excuse given that one of the companies behind the release, New World Pictures, was also responsible for the original Hellraiser, which was also low budget but still managed to make a visually appealing story. The more realistic reason is also the most blunt: the source material is among the worst of what Stephen King has ever published which, in turn, spawned a laughable script and a casting team that weren't able to get sufficient enough talent to make the work their own.The acting is wooden and one-dimensional, every single character is a throw-away, the effects are pathetic even for its time period, the film is a jumbled mess that, ultimately, fails to hold the audience's attention. It's trying to do too many things at once and appears unfocused, which is ironic given the format of the source material.This film leaves many more questions than the quantity of answers it provides (and not in a good way). Perhaps the most confusing enigma of this entire film is how the studios managed to produce 8 (direct or indirect) sequels and a remake out of this. Who in the world is asking for this?It's easy to decipher, upon closer inspection, that Children of the Corn has fallen victim to the same curse that Hellraiser has: we, the audience, are to be blessed with an entirely new movie every couple of years. Not because someone was inspired to continue the story or had some revolutionary ideas they wanted to incorporate, but rather to maintain the rights, which is both sad and pathetic.And now, I'm watching this series in its entirety for the first time.",Children of the Corn

The effects are terrible, much like the camera angles and other directorial features.There was a bright spot - cute young Linda Hamilton begins a little striptease in the bedroom early on.

84,hellholehorror,Enjoyable and occasionally scary horror,6,1 October 2017,A nice little gritty horror movie from the eighties. It relies on the suspense built up from effectively menacing kids of the cult. There are some laughable bits like the corn parting to make a path and the occult effects at the end but I forgive these as they were just trying to make the film more supernatural. The only thing I didn't like was the religious and moral overtones. I got the impression that this was a Christian film warning of the dangers of other religions. That aside this is an enjoyable and occasionally scary horror film with two really evil characters.,Children of the Corn

You rooted for the good guys, but at the same time wanted to see the bad guys doing their thing. There were only 2 big things that made me give this an 8 rather than a 10. One thing that knocked a star off of this movie's rating were the special FX. They seemed very unnecessary and were ridiculous also to the point of giggling at them. Another star-killer was the movie's pacing. Some things in the movie went by in about 30 seconds, while others took almost 2 scenes to complete. However, this movie didn't have to use the ""night"" tactic to be eerie. The eeriness was that it took place in the middle of the day.

Credit to George Goldsmith and Fritz Kiersch for pulling of the chilling King concepts and atmosphere. The editing and sound was uniquely done, using odd shots, grittier images and fast paced filming techniques. Also, the filmmakers delivered on portraying the children as gruesome, evil figures. Both the young actors, John Franklin and Courtney Gains worked perfectly together as the film's arch villains, Isaac and Malachai. There roles were equally sinister, and their lines delivered to each were enthralling. The lead roles of Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton were also a team that had good chemistry on screen.

91,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Classic Stephen King,6,19 June 2008,"The murder rate is as high as an elephant's eye in this flaccid adaptation of Stephen King's short story. While driving through Nebraska en route to a new job, medico Burt (Peter Horton) and his wife Vicky (a PR-Terminator Linda Hamilton) nearly run over a mutilated boy who staggers from the cornfields. Seeking help, they enter the town of Gatlin, whose under-20 residents have butchered their parents per the decree of junior-grade holy roller Isaac (John Franklin), who preaches the word of a being called ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows."" King's original story (from his 1978 collection Night Shift) was a lean and brutal melange of Southern-Gothic atmosphere and E.C. Comics-style gore, which script Greg Goldsmith effectively neutralizes by adding a youthful narrator (a grating Robbie Kiger) and putting an upbeat spin on the story's morbid conclusion. Fritz Kiersch's direction is TV-movie flat, with the sole inspired moment (hideous religious iconography glimpsed during a bloody ""service"") delivered as a throwaway. Aside from Horton and Courtney Gains (as Isaac's hatchet man Malachai), the performances are dreadful, and the depiction of the Lovecraftian monster-god as a sort of giant gopher inspires more laughter than terror. Amazingly, the film spawned six sequels; Franklin (Cousin Itt in the Addams Family films) later appeared in and wrote 1999's Children of the Corn 666.",Children of the Corn
92,dommercaldi,Absolute Drivel And Definitely One Of The Worst Stephen King Adaptations,1,22 July 2020,"Pros:
1. The blood and gore, whilst limited, is brutal and it helps to harden the impact of the deaths - both onscreen and offscreen.
2. The score does as good as a job as it can to increase the tension and suspense.Cons:
1. The acting is really stale, particularly from the child actors.
2. The jump-scares are cheaply, and poorly, inserted and are far more annoying than scary.
3. The camera-work is often very strange and obnoxious at times with pointless zoom-ins.
4. The movie is rife with unintelligent and lazy commentary on the potential evils of religion.
5. None of the characters are developed enough for the viewer to care about anything that happens to them.
6. A few of the obvious horror moments end up coming off as unintentionally humourous.
7. The dialogue is incredibly clunky, as well as being abhorrently delivered by the actors.
8. The supernatural angle introduced to the film with 20 minutes to go is not only awfully done, but it feels massively out-of-place.
9. The special effects towards the end of the film are extremely out-dated.
10. There are some glaringly unanswered plot-holes: A) In the 3 years since the initial killings, apparently the cops and the feds were unaware of said killings. B) After being indoctrinated for 3 years by Isaac (John Franklin), the children became deradicalised in 20 seconds by a speech by Burt (Peter Horton).",Children of the Corn
93,TheRedDeath30,A Childhood Favorite that I Love to this Day,9,6 October 2014,"When we, as film fans, talk about our ""favorite movies"", they can usually be broken down into two very distinct categories. First, are the timeless classics. These are the movies that have stood the test of time as great cinema and will be loved by generation after generation. Moves like FRANKENSTEIN and PSYCHO were classics on their release and will remain classics for generations to come.Then, there is the second category. These are the the ""time and place"" movies. What I mean by that is that a particular viewer's devotion to the movie is probably based more on the time and place it was seen, rather than the intrinsic quality of the movie itself. I have rated this movie with a 9, which is much higher than the average IMDb rank and I would, firmly, admit that my own favoritism of this movie probably has a lot more to do with the time and place I saw it and the impact it had on me then.You see, I was 9 years old when this movie was released. I did not, of course, have the privilege of seeing it at the movie, but my parents did. I remember distinctly my parents talking with the family members they had seen the movie with about how scary it was to them. As a young kid, anything that scared your mom you assume has to be outright terrifying for you. It was probably around a year later that I did see the movie, thanks to the wonders of HBO and grandparents who would late me stay up late to watch pretty much anything I wanted. The movie did, indeed, scare the holy hell out of me.There are a number of things going for this movie that I still find effective now. The first is that score, consisting of a creepy child's choir singing songs that sounds like hymns to a pagan god. There is something inherently unsettling about that mixture of innocence and occultism, which is of course the main theme of this entire movie. Secondly, we have the background setting of the corn fields themselves. Having grown up near to similar fields myself, there was always something mildly disturbing about them. Maybe the limited visibility that provided such a ripe hiding place for murderers, or the strange sounds that always seemed to emanate from those fields (knowing as an adult, they were just birds and animals, but as a kid they were frightening).Of course, as I have mentioned one of the most disturbing things about this movie are the children themselves. The idea of innocent children becoming murderers has certainly been used in film before and will be used again and again because it is that antithesis of innocence and evil that is so effective. This is carried out even further here because of their religious devotion. The almost Amish costumes worn, the religious ceremonies and symbolism, the desecration of the Christian symbols, all of these things are used to excellent effect to create a nightmarish scenario for our heroes to be stuck in. Then, there's Malachai, he is such a relentless, cold killer. We are introduced to him early in the movie as he leads the children in slaughtering their parents at the local cafe, then we see just how malevolent he's become as he stalks a young boy trying to escape the town and murders him in the corn fields. He is as good a villain as any slasher film has because he conveys the same sense of unstoppable evil.As I stated early in the review, though, I also realize that there are things that don't hold up very well about this movie, at all, yet I tend to overlook them because I probably still see the movie the way I did as a 9-year old. The main adults make dumb decisions (as most horror characters do I guess). The movie tends to really drag out in the middle, an inevitable results in turning a short story in a feature film. The special effects in the climax are not very good at all. Not only are they very indicative of their time, but weren't that good for the time they were released, highlighting the low budget of the movie.I can understand why someone who viewed this for the first time today may not like it, but for the children of the 80s who grew up with this movie, I think a good deal of us still consider this to be a horror classic.",Children of the Corn
94,Darkest_Rose,Those Children deserved a good Beating,7,29 June 2003,"Something is very wrong in a small town called Gaitlin.

This was a very creepy movie, those kids scared the hell out of me and I think the only way they could have been stopped is with a good beating. The soundtrack is also quite frightening and the acting by the children is both impressive and scary. I would give Children of the Corn 7/10.",Children of the Corn
95,happyendingrocks,"More like ""Children Of The Corn-y""... Who didn't see that one coming?",5,9 October 2009,"Stephen King's short stories have rarely fared well upon adaptation, so it's not surprising that Children Of The Corn doesn't knock it out of the park. The source material itself is one of King's merely decent moments, and only presents a sketch of the events that are fleshed out here, so we're left to trust the film-makers to put some meat on the bones of this tale about a cult-like band of religious zealot children who murder any adults they come across to appease an unseen ""god"" that lurks in the vast cornfields surrounding their desolate town. Though the core concept is rather intriguing, the execution here leaves a lot to be desired, and while Children Of The Corn isn't awful, it also isn't good.The bulk of King's original story is represented here, and the set-up that leads our hapless couple into the lair of the murderous children is portrayed quite well. But the film uses one of these children (a non-murderous one, luckily for the couple) to narrate the tale, which allows the film-makers to delve into elements of King's story that were only hinted at in the text, but also confuses the entire plot as we try to make sense of why only the narrator and his companion have managed to reject the religious fervor that grips every other child in the small Nebraska town.The source of this spiritual mania, only alluded to in King's story, is given full reign here, and that's ultimately what makes this film so utterly goofy. You see, our titular Children aren't just moved by their sinister saviour (""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"", natch) to murder all of the adults in town, but also to gather in the cornfields conducting religious sermons in wildly antiquated language. If the humor in these lengthy interactions between the psychobabble-spouting children was intentional, then we have to praise the film-makers for getting their point across, but one suspects that the kids are mostly playing things straight. This makes clunky dialogue like ""question me not, Malachai, for it is I who has been chosen"" and the classic ""Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, Outlander!"" inherently hilarious.Since we're relying almost exclusively on a cast of children, it isn't surprising that most of the acting in this film is atrocious. The afore-mentioned dialogue certainly doesn't help in this regard, and we can see the Children struggling to make sense of the Victorian language they are asked to emote (""seize him""? Who EVER says ""seize him""?). The lanky lad portraying the evil Malachai has a particularly hard time keeping a straight face while spewing his hateful machinations, which is particularly fitting since we end up having a hard time keeping a straight face while we watch him spew them. Ditto with Isaac, the de facto leader of this crop-worshiping cult, thus the source of most of the silliest passages of lugubrious religious rhetoric.While a massacre in a diner starts the plot off, since the MPAA zealously neutered this film this expository sequence loses much of its horrific value. Most of the movie beyond the onset is relatively bloodless, which strips away the implied menace of the blade-toting kids, since we rarely see the results of their handiwork. Clearly there wasn't a big budget for effects, and this is never more evident than during the scenes where He Who Walks Behind The Rows manifests Himself, which integrate live footage with some very cheap and shoddy fire animation.Wisely, the film-makers have the sense to keep their apparently subterranean beast under wraps, but one of the ambiguities of King's original story was whether the children actually were in service of some dark presence, or if a collective insanity settled over them and prompted them to create a myth to support their murderous deeds. Personally, I find the second scenario more frightening. Apparently, the film-makers disagree with me, and they make it clear that there is something dwelling underneath the cornfield (shouldn't it be ""He Who Walks BELOW The Rows"", then?). This sort of negates the sensibility of the climactic showdown with He, since laying waste to the cornfields with fire wouldn't do much to destroy a creature that lives safely burrowed under the cornfield, would it? Of course, this leaves definite room for a sequel... no less than six, in fact. I've never invested my time in any of the follow-ups, so I can't judge those objectively, but despite the few bits of inspiration here, Children Of The Corn is barely worth visiting once, let alone returning to for multiple harvests.But we do have to thank the Children for providing satire fodder for a particularly funny episode of South Park. Indeed, seeing this film makes a great deal of ""The Wacky Molestation Adventure"" that much more hilarious, so I can certainly recommend it for that purpose.However, as a horror film, Children Of The Corn is just too silly to have much impact. The premise here is decent, however, so perhaps the 2009 television remake did better things with it. I'll let you know when I see it.",Children of the Corn
96,meathookcinema,A great adaptation of Stephen King's short story,7,8 November 2020,"I first saw Children of the Corn when it was first shown on UK TV in the mid 80's. The following day it would appear that most of my school friends had seen the movie too as we all recalled the events of the film in grisly and lurid detail.On watching the film again recently I can say that it holds up very well indeed. The plot involves two characters called Vicky and Burt taking a roadtrip and happening upon a small Nebraska town called Gatlin. A major red flag goes up when the couple notice that on approaching the town the radio now only plays content that appears to be Baptist 'fire and brimstone' style sermons.What Burt and Vicky don't know is that three years earlier the town's adultfolk had been slaughtered on the wishes of 13 year old Isaac who has set up his own religious sect with 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows' as their god, the rows being the huge cornfield which is central to Gatlin. A failed harvest had prompted the uprising with Isaac asserting that his new god needs human sacrifices to be appeased and so that there are bountiful harvests as a result. Young child Job wasn't involved as his father didn't like Isaac and so wasn't allowed to go to a gathering organised by Isaac for all of the town's children. Job's sister Sarah also wasn't there as she was severely ill with a fever. She is shown to have some kind of psychic powers and depicts what she sees from the future in the pictures she draws.Things go from bad to worse for the adult couple who have now stumbled across the town which has been run by Isaac and his henchman deputy Malachi for three years now. When they hear about the adult trespassers they demand for them to be captured and then sacrificed to their cornrows deity. Poor Burt and Vicky. They discover Job and his sister who assist them in not becoming human sacrifices.This film has a great premise which is based on a short story by Master of Horror Stephen King. The film also taps into one of the last taboos especially in film which is that of the killer child. And here we have scores of them. The milleu of the religious sect and the small details connected to this like the children being made to change their names to more biblical monikers also adds to the utterly sinister tone of the film. It also shows what can go wrong when a setback or downturn of fortunes can be taken as an opportunity by a charismatic person with sinister motives to come to prominence and give the downtrodden and disillusioned someone to believe in even though he/she is up to no good.The opening scene takes place in a diner in which the children present (after being given the nod by Isaac) poison and violently slaughter the adults in attendance. I remember being utterly shocked by this scene in particular when I first saw the film and I can reliably report that it's hasn't lost any of it's power to shock decades later.But this isn't the only sequence which has the power not just to shock but also to worm it's way inside your head. The sequence in which Vicky is placed on a cross with it then being hoisted up, the shot showing the weapons hanging from the hands of the children as they descent on a house which has one of the couple in it and the gruesome scene in the church as we see what happens to the children who come of age are such examples.The casting of the movie is also excellent with Sarah Hamilton as Vicky and Peter Horton as Burt. But the attention to detail regarding the casting of the children is just as impressive. The casting of the freakishly sinister Isaac and his horrifyingly hillbilly deputy Malachi are inspired. In fact, it seems they cast every child with unconventional and unique looks.Another great quality that the film possesses is whether He Who Walks Behind The Rows is actually a real supernatural force or just completely fabricated by Isaac.There are also some 80's visual effects in the film which are still extremely pleasing to the eye and have aged very well indeed.In fact the same can be said about the whole film. In lesser hands, this could have aged terribly and been forgotten about. Instead we get a film where thought and innovation were used to fully bring to life King's great plot idea and which still has it's own rabid fanbase. However the film still doesn't get enough praise or recognition when films are talked about which were adapted from King's novels. This is a real shame. Maybe this will change.",Children of the Corn
97,ryan-10075,Just Too Unbelivable For Me,4,9 January 2019,"Within a little dot on the map called Gatlin, Nebraska the children have done the unthinkable and killed off all the adults in town. All because of the teachings of an authentic wacko named Isaac. Although it is an entity that hides within the corn that really directs the group. A couple (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) hit a boy who is trying to escape the cult. They then visit Gatlin and discover the terror.Now there are elements I did enjoy to the film like the casting of the children seemed to be smart choices including John Franklin as Isaac and Courtney Gains as Malachai both I believe screen debuts for both and both characters that have gone off the deep end. I know I may not have the opinion of most, but I found this low-budget horror movie just too silly in how it was handled and not scary at all. It may have worked better to me if the evil characters were introduced before the violent ending to the adults happened or perhaps a deeper look into the madness that made this child-cult happen. In addition the effects when they are shown at the end are sub-par. If they went with characters or delving deeper into the story rather than using cheesy effects it would have worked better for me. Supposedly the original script written by Stephen King may have went more that way.Also starring fabulous character actor R.G. Armstrong as the old man who tries to steer the couple away from Gatlin. But, even his death is not exactly well explained as he did his job didn't he? Maybe if you put up signs directing people away from Gatlin not towards it you might not get so many visitors.Having read the short story penned by Stephen King I do believe it works much better in that form.

I like the atmosphere of it. The actors are all pretty good too. Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton are wonderful as the lead characters Burt and Vicki.

In the original story King managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful.

100,RockPortReview,A Classic Horror Masterpiece!,10,14 May 2014,"Released in the Spring of '84 ""Children of the Corn"" is another in a long series of classic horror movies based on a story by Stephen King. It mixes two popular horror sub-genres in religious horror and creepy killer kids. Although there have been numerous sequels, 7 to be exact. Nothing compares to the original in its iconic evil main characters Isaac and Malachi. It's a great story that really is pure evil.The story opens in the small Midwestern town of Gatlin, Nebraska in a little cafe where many of towns people gather. Little do they know that the children have planned a sort of reckoning and soon they will be left to fend for themselves. Their leader being the child preacher named Isaac. Isaac is probably about 12 or 13 and is short for his age. His voice is fairly high and has quite the violent temper. His second in command is the equally vicious red haired Malachi. They're a couple of little Christian fundamentalists that rule with an iron fist and warn to fear ""The one who walks behind the rows"". They all congregate in the corn fields and listen to Isaac spew his sermons.Our adult hero's are Burt and Vicki (Linda Hamilton) who are traveling across the country back to Seattle when they accidentally hit a kid who ran out a corn field. They find that his throat was slit and stick his corpse in the trunk. Trying to find a phone (no cell phones it's1984) they run into one of the oldest horror cliché know to man. The run down gas station in the middle of nowhere run by a crazy old man. The station's phone is not working and is also out of gas for that matter. They are told to avoid Gatlin and to go to the next town over for help. Although they do try to find the other town, it seems that all roads lead to Gatlin. When they arrive they find nothing but a ghost town and no working phones. They search a few houses and end up finding Sarah, a little girl drawing pictures. She has the power to see the future and her drawings are very important to the group. Her and her brother Gob are two kids who want to get away from Isaac and the cult but are too afraid to do anything about it. Vicki stays with the girl while Burt goes to look for others. The house is then attacked by Malachi and company, taking Vicki hostage.The plot is pretty simple but the characters are memorable. Some of the visual effects are pretty laughable, but it's still a scary film even by today's standards. Just like the classic films ""Village of the Dammed"" or ""The Lord of the Flies"" the children form their own society and things get pretty intense. However the ""Children of the Corn"" have a bunch of help from the devil himself or is it an angry God? The movie is currently available on Netflix watch instantly.",Children of the Corn
101,Otkon,More like Childish and Corny.,5,14 June 2020,"This is another Stephen King adaptation from my youth. But this one I really wasn't fond of - even back then.First of all, you have Sarah Connor and Thirty-Something traveling though the heartland on a big city move to Seattle. And he is supposed to be a doctor? But they have no luggage, and they couldn't have flown? Hm, okay. And then they run over some kid standing in the road. But apparently he was already dead. And standing in the road. Sure.Then they go exploring the Town of the Corn where three years earlier all the kids rose up and killed the adults, starting a nice little religious sect without ever raising an eyebrow to the outside world. No one noticed that the adults weren't paying taxes or bills anymore. That the kids were no longer going to schools or having their home-schooling checked on. And no one's extended relatives from elsewhere have ever wondered why Little Jebediah and Suzetta Sue don''t sent Granny June in Tupelo a Christmas card anymore?And of course, the kids are awful. When I was a kid, I remember intensely disliking the characters of Malachi and Isaac and that one stabby girl. They were just so memorably hammy and cheesy and dreadful. Even worse are the effects of He Who Walks Beyond the Rows as well as the climactic immolation of the cornfields. in 1984, $800,000 didn't go a long way clearly.And the happy ending really betrays the grim horror of the original story.The one thing this movie has going for it is that the children appear to be early adopters of bio-fuel. Isaac is upset that Malachi has killed the old man from the service station who was supplying them with gasoline to power their generators. But Malachi informs him that they no longer needed such an energy source as He Who Walks Beyond the Rows has bestowed upon them a bumper crop of corn and the knowledge of how to distill ethanol from it. This leads to a political power struggle between Isaac's antiquated reactionary regime and Malachi's progressive ecological-based coalition.The movie is not that deep and these kids are still dreadful. And the ethanol does lead to the burning of the fields. But it is a good step in the right direction. Hopefully future versions of this tale will include even cleaner renewable sources of energy like wind and solar. Maybe Children of the Composted Corn. And He Who Recycles Beyond the Rows.",Children of the Corn

103,RhapsodyReviews,"Strong Start, Lacking Finish.",6,15 October 2019,"Review:
'Children of the Corn' is an American supernatural-horror film directed by Fritz Kiersch. It is based upon Stephen King's short story of the same name. The movie was a big surprise for me, I know if you read a lot of my review for film, it seems like a lot of movie are a surprise to me. I just know what I like and when I think I'm going to be seeing a film that isn't up my alley, but I ultimately end up enjoying is great.
The plot focused around a young couple, Burt and Vicky (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) who are on a road to make a job interview for Burt, who is an intern to be a doctor. Meanwhile, a boy preacher named Isaac (John Franklin) gets all of the children in the town of Gatlin to believe that it is His will to murder every adult in town. Now, with Burt and Vicky stuck in Gatlin with car trouble, they must fight to survive before the children kill them too.
First and foremost, I really liked the acting in this movie. Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton are obviously great, but what I was most impressed with is the kids. The kids were very menacing, and the leader Isaac was fantastic.
The movie is far to be a masterpiece. Leading its main characters endlessly around cornfields and then through the deserted town to expand the short story to feature film length, the movie ends up suffering from its slow pace. Also, the ending, with the manifestation of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"", is a bit of a let down to say the least. They could have done something different to make it look better, even for back than. However, this isn't a bad movie it is a well performed little B-Horror movie that surprisingly enough spawned a franchise.
Overall, I got a kick out of the movie. When I give a movie a bad rating, it's mostly due to the fact that it didn't entertain me, but I can safely say that I was entertained throughout this whole movie.

104,bayardhiler,Unfairly Bashed King Adaptation,9,14 November 2013,"Anyone who's seen a lot of movies adapted from the works of Stephen King knows that some of his stories don't always translate to the big screen very well or if they do, they're almost never as good as the printed versions. Be that as it may, there are some stories of King's that do translate very well to the cinema and despite what some might say, 1984's ""Children of the Corn"" is one of them. Based off of King's short story, it takes place in small town USA, Nebraska where the only thing people probably ever talk about is corn, what's going with so and so, and the weather. All that changes one Sunday morning when, in a particularly harrowing opening scene, all the town's adults are brutally killed by the town's children under the leadership of the mysterious Isaac (John Franklin) and his brutal lieutenant Malachi (Courtney Gains). From then on, the children are part of a bizarre cult that uses corn and human sacrifice as a way to worship some type of pagan god/demon known simply as He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Fast forward three years later and we find that a happy couple in the form of Burt (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton) are passing through the corn fields of Nebraska for what they think will be a normal trip to Burt's new job as a doctor when they seemly hit a young kid standing in the middle of the road. But Burt, through his medical training, knows that the kid was already dead with a cut throat and from there, they reach (that's right, you guessed it) the strange town where nobody seemly lives, except the children of the corn and brother and sister Job and Sara, who for some reason are allowed to remain outside the cult. Will any of them make it out alive? Even though this movie has been unfairly dragged through the mud over the years, the film is actually kind of creepy, with the seemly abandoned town covered with tons of corn stalks at every turn, decaying infrastructure, and Isaac. Played by John Franklin (who was actually 23 but with a dwarfism disease looks 12) Isaac is a spooky character, partly because of his creepy demeanor but also because of the fact that one can easily find people like him in real life in the form of such infamous men like Jim Jones or Charles Manson. Unlike those guys however, Isaac's cult has real magic behind it in the form of Behind the rows deity, who we never actually see but through some creative effects know very well that he is real! Courtney Gains should also be congratulated for his role of vicious right hand man Malachi who with his cold glare and big machete, would make anyone obey Isaac. And of course, who can forget his famous line: ""OUTLANDER! We have your woman!"". Peter Horton is good in the role of hero as is Linda Hamilton in the part of damsel in distress, almost right before she shot to fame through the sci-fi classic ""The Terminator"" of the same year. The movie does require one to suspend disbelief a little bit, such as why the hell don't Burt and Vicky get the hell out of town right away when they have the chance? But the movie is never dull and manages to keep you on the edge of your seat right until the climatic ending. It's a movie that will entertain you while harboring the hidden warning about false prophets and religious extremism under its surface. In case you're wondering, Stephen King was not a big fan of this film but don't forget that King also didn't like Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"" and that was a great, creepy film, was it not? While I can't speak for any of the sequels that came after this, check this one out and just to give you a fair warning, you may never look at a field of corn the same way again!",Children of the Corn
105,MichaelMRamey,Doesn't Live Up To It's Iconic Status,5,8 October 2018,"I've been hearing about Children Of the Corn for quite a while and finally sat down to watch it and unfortunately it was underwhelming. This is one of my least favourite Stephen King film adaptations. The film moves at a very slow pace and just reaches 90 minutes. If they cut out all of the driving around and wandering the town scenes, you'd probably have a one hour television special. The actor that plays Malachai feels like he's reading his lines every time he opens his mouth. Children of the Corn also falls under ever single horror cliche to the point it became boring and noticeable. Burt decides to go to the town, then despite no one being there decides they should stay instead of driving over to the next town, then he enters a house instead of just leaving as was planned, then he decides they should split up, falling down twice while running and running straight into a post it felt more like a comedy routine.

107,HorrorFan1984,Children of the Corn,8,6 October 2020,"The Children of the Corn are killing adults in a sleepy Nebraska town. A young couple takes a wrong turn and ends upThe film starts in 1981 in a small farm town named Gatlin, Nebraska. While sitting in a coffee shop after church one Sunday, 8 year old Job witnesses a group of teenagers kill all the adults in the place - including his father. Job says (in narration) that killings of adults took place all over Gatlin that day. Fast forward 3 years to present day where we meet Vicky and Burt who are driving through the countryside hoping to start a new life with Burt just wrapping up his medical degree. While driving near cornfields, Burt accidentally hits a young boy with his car. However, after looking at the body, he notices that the child was already stabbed before being hit by the car.With a potential murder on their hands, Vicky and Burt drive in search of help to the empty ghost town of Gatlin where all shops and businesses (and adults) are dead. After being separated, Vicky is kidnapped by the teens led by the evil Malachai and taken to the cornfields where their religious leader Isaac does sermons to everyone under 18 on how all adults must be killed. Isaac proclaims it is ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" who is in charge and lays down these rules. Eventually we see that these aren't just the rantings of a teenage preacher and that there are some supernatural and evil forces at work in the corn.The Children of the Corn series produced many pitiful sequels and remakes, but none of them captured the great story and creepy atmosphere like this first one did. I thought the secluded town they used as Gatlin was super effective towards building up that isolated fear viewers were supposed to feel. The Stephen King story is universally disliked it seems by most horror fans, but I found the idea of all adults being wiped out by the towns children/teenagers to be a unique and creative one. The last 20 minutes and ending left a lot of questions still left to be answered as to what was this demonic force in the corn, but luckily six-seven sequels answer all of those questions in painful detail.The acting was just fine, Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton leading the way as the ""outlanders"". Hamilton brought her final girl vibes fresh off of The Terminator with Sarah Connor, and Horton was a strong male lead that had chemistry with Hamilton. Their characters were super likeable and felt realistic as a couple first struggling with commitment issues and then fighting off psychotic religious children. John Franklin was a standout as Isaac as was Courtney Gains as Malachai. There were also two child actors (Anne Marie McEvoy & Robby Kiger) who played Sarah and Job and were standouts. They were really talented for kids in a horror film like this, very likeable as well.All in all, Children of the Corn is a favourite of mine in the horror genre. I don't think it gets a lot of love, mostly due to the fact we don't actually see the demon/monster in the fields as well as the lame sequels that followed. It's worth a viewing for any horror fan at least once.8/10",Children of the Corn

One time while I was at the library I checked out a book of his called ""Night Shift."" It is a collection of short stories, one of which is ""Children Of The Corn."" When I read the short story, I was freaked out beyond belief, and strangely while I read it, I was in a car at night going down a road with corn fields on the side of the road. I quickly decided to rent the movie and I had my hopes up. When the movie started, I was disappointed by it. The direction is like something you would see in a TV movie, most of the performances are horrible, and the movie just doesn't deliver any scares at all. In real life this would have been the most terrifying thing ever, but due to certain faults, the movie just didn't work.(Spoilers) A bunch of kids in a rural Nebraska town kill the adults in their town and take over, forming their own little cult.

Having grown up watching this film, and being obsessed with horror, I suppose I am a little biased when reviewing Children of the Corn. Yes, the script is flimsy. Yes, the special effects are dire. Yes, the story doesn't make a great deal of sense, particularly towards the end. But somehow, there is just something cool about this film that secures its place in my collection as a cult classic.First of all, it's pretty chilling. Linda Hamilton's great to watch, and John Franklin and Courtney gains creep you out like they're supposed to. The opening massacre in the coffee shop of all adults carried out by children is possibly the most disturbing of all. The first two acts of the film, in spite of the daftness, keep you with it.But in the third act of the move, this is where things start to get a little messy, and its high concept deviates into silly religious hokum. The plot deviates greatly from its source material, the original short story by Stephen King, and the movie ends with what seems to be a hastily thrown together action-sequence, where our heroes battle 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows', the demon that inspired the children to slaughter their parents. Complete with very questionable special effects, poor dialogue and nonsensical biblical passages, it brings what has been a fairly fun and chilling ride to a less than interesting conclusion.This is the best one of the lot.

110,jamhorner,Fields of Dreams or Nightmares?,7,29 July 2007,"When I first herd the synopsis, a town that has been brutally murdered and taken over by kids, I honestly thought it would be a comedy. It's not as funny as it sounds. This movie scared the hell out of me. This was the movie the turned me to the ""Stephen King Side of the Literary World."" This movie had everything a horror should have and also a kid's best fantasy, aside from the whole ""killing your parents and slashing the entire town"" thing.The reason why this horror movie works is that it could happen. It's not so much jump out scary but more of the disturbing scary. Here are 12-year-olds and 9-year-olds all the way up to 17-year-olds killing their parents in the name of a false corn god. It could happen and there are religions that have brainwashed kids into murdering people in the name of their false god. Given the fact that this town is completely secluded from any major civilian population, that just adds to the sense of helplessness. You can't go anywhere because there is nothing for miles except corn.One of the other elements that make this horror seem more disturbing is the ritual and the ceremonies that these kids hold to praise ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows."" The ceremony for ""The Man in Blue"" and the sacrificing ceremonies are all so crazy and weird. This movie hits so close to pseudo-Christianity it's scary. The casting and the acting are great. Courtney Gains who played Malachai did a great job playing the deranged teen that heavily believes in his false god. His catch phrase ""Outlanders!"" is classic. John Franklin who plays Isaac Chroner doesn't need to act, his character is elegant and quiet enough to where his looks puts the fear into you head.Overall, this movie is child's dream on ecstasy. If you enjoy disturbing horror and general weirdness, you'll like this movie. It gets gory pretty early and becomes hard to watch so I am warning you ahead of time.",Children of the Corn

112,thelastblogontheleft,Not Quite There,4,7 January 2017,"This was another re-watch for me and I said the same thing this time that I did after the first viewing: I just don't think kids are that scary. I know lots of movies try to pull of the whole ""creepy kid"" thing and it just doesn't do it for me.Ultimately, I think this movie starts off really strong and it gave me high hopes. The whole chaotic scene at the diner, with the kids watching as the adults are poisoned and murdered awesome. I mean, they put a dude's hand through a meat slicer and that creepy music with the kids chanting is playing and you can see beady-eyed Isaac (played awesomely by John Franklin) peering through the window, very pleased at what's going on, and you think hell yeah, I am in for a fun ride.Then we cut to Burt (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton), who are on their way to Burt's new physician job. They're driving along, cornrow after cornrow whizzing by, and BOOM, out lurches one of the children, half dead from these tiny cult members. It's an intense scene, with a closeup of the kid rolling under the tires, and you can almost feel their sense of panic and confusion. Again, hell yeah, we're on the right track here. We even get an awesome jump scare when Vicky drifts off in the car while waiting for Burt to return from looking for help.But then I don't know, things get a little silly. They try to find a phone to no avail — the town is abandoned, with corn leaves strewn all over — what? Are the kids just constantly covered in corn leaves and accidentally leaving them places? Is it some kind of calling card?There's some transfer of power with Malachai (Courtney Gains), the brain of the operation — who is by far the scariest looking kid — insisting that Isaac be sacrificed. The whole thing is way too easy, the kids need NO convincing whatsoever, and then boom, Isaac is up on a cross. But He Who Walks Behind the Rows (admittedly a super creepy moniker, but not actually creepy in reality since it just kind of burrows its way under the dirt) is not very discerning, apparently, and takes Isaac despite his pleas. The special effects are shockingly, laughably bad. I want to say maybe it's charming — it was the mid-80's after all. Burt tries to talk some sense into the kids and tell them they're worshipping a false god (which is also VERY easy to do), and then Isaac comes back as a sort of zombie-Isaac and kills Malachai. Wheee!They gather the kids into a barn and realize they need to destroy the cornfield to stop the evil, and they figure the best way is to burn it all up. They do so, and there's a LEGIT SAD FACE IN THE SMOKE AS IT BURNS. I COULDN'T EVEN HANDLE IT WHAT? WHAT??Then everything is hunky dory and Burt and Vicky are leaving (with Sarah and Job in tow) and it's kind of implied that the kids are going to stay with them?? And then one of the evil kids is hiding in the car and attacks them but Burt just kind of annoyedly stops her and they're on their way. SO FREAKING WEIRD.I don't know, I wanted to like it — it's based on a Stephen King story after all — but I think the rest of the movie couldn't even try to compare to those first couple scenes. It has its few very brief moments but nothing else to really grab you. Womp.",Children of the Corn

114,blurnieghey,Children Of The Crap,2,31 October 2021,"I've never been a Stephen King fan and I've never been able to fathom how the guy managed to become such a popular horror writer. OK, actually I can fathom it and I'm just being rhetorical, as the truth would probably insult some people. So, typically of King, this film crosses the line of ""suspense of disbelief"" into the realm where some sort of mental impairment or being borderline mentally retarded would be required to accept with the ""story"", so, let's see: none of the dead adults had family in nearby towns? No one in any of the nearby towns ever went to that town (the closest of which was only a 20 or so minute drive away)? No adult in the town owed money on a mortgage? None of the utility companies noticed how everyone in the town quit paying their bills? The state police never passed through there? The adults had no relatives or children who moved away that would come to visit or even phone? Since corn is a seasonal plant and Nebraska has winters, the corn would die every winter and the town would be visible from the road, never mind that the big, bad ""scary"" corn would be dead and not a threat and, if it wasn't, it would stand out like a sore thumb to anyone passing by. And those are just a few questions off the top of my head that I think anyone with a shred of brains would be asking but, hey, if you can get past that, maybe you'll be able to tolerate this flick.All that aside, the special effects in this film are very poor quality, like what you would find in some low-budget B-flick, but this was actually in all the major mainstream theaters and did quite well, if memory serves. I remember sort of liking it at the time and would like to say it didn't age well, but that would indicate it was once good in the first place, which it wasn't. I was just too young and dumb to notice what a piece of crap it was. This film deserves a B-Movie status and is completely overrated to say the least, later spawning some equally bad sequels the world could have done without, but at least they didn't involve Stephen King.",Children of the Corn

Two minutes into it and there had been countless scares! The scariest part was when Malachai (Courtney Gains) appeared in the cornfield. Then two minutes after that came what I see as the scariest shot in cinematic history. Anyone who isn't scared by that road scene is made of stone or they are a robot. Even when its rewound back people jumped even when they knew it was going to happen! It starts out when the corn crop has failed in a small town in Nebraska called Gatlin. A sinister boy preacher Isaac Chroner(John Franklin) says only human blood will restore it. So they kill all the adults in town to obey Isaac and his hatchet man Malachai.3 years after partners Burt and Vicky stumble upon Gatlin but in Gatlin every adult must die!What really set this film apart is the score, direction and the cinematography. Jonathan Elias made bone chilling music along with the children singing as haunting as Gregorian chanting. Kiersch knew what camera angles to use and when not to use Elias' score to create a haunting silence. Also the lighting and look complimented the excellent shots. 10 out of 10 no doubt.",Children of the Corn

119,lale-ba,NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED,5,28 January 2018,"There are different kinds of Stephen King's movie adaptations, and the one about the blood thirsty religious cult of children in some God forsaken village in Nebraska is not one of the milder ones.
Pretty gory for its era, it tends to dissipate its script when it comes to credibility of the entire concept, but nonetheless, 1984 version of ''Children of the Corn'' will give you a few goosebumps. Acting will be solid, especially when it comes to children, but much of the true story behind the cult will be saved for the much weaker sequels.
''Children of the Corn'' is still to be considered as one of the more serious horrors of the 1980s.",Children of the Corn
120,MWNiese,Atmospheric Horror Marred By Closing Special Effects,10,23 January 2010,"*******Seven out of Ten Stars******* A young doctor and his wife fall off track on a cross country trip, winding up in a small town called Gatlin. It turns out Gatlin has been taken over by a cult of religious fanatics operated by children. The doctor and his wife soon find themselves running for their lives, as they look for a way to escape Gatlin and ""The Children of the Corn"" This is an 80's horror classic, whether or not you want to admit it. Most of the hatred this film garners is because of the closing special effects. I understand why people hate the F/X in this film, but I don't quite agree when people flunk an entire 90 minute film because of two minutes of special effects tacked onto the very end. In defense of the film makers, the budget for ""Children"" was pitiful. On the other hand, the producers just should have tried ending this film in a more appropriate way, namely a way that didn't include God awful special effects.The rest of the film is fairly well done, considering the large number of child actors involved. The sound score is delightful 80's horror creep-ness, the location used for shooting is quintessential small town America, and the religious child sect is pulled off with panache and style that Satan himself would be proud to be a part of. This writer also personally feels as if the cinematography was above average, as was the directing; it couldn't have been easy working with all those children. This film just has a great atmospheric 80's small town, satanic, feel to it; and I love it. The satanic corn folk art is worth a view as well. There are some quality jump scares and some of the special effects nearer to the middle of the running time are actually pretty decent. Linda Hamilton is fun to watch in the role of Vicki and the characters that lead the child cult, Isaac and Malachai, are a blast to see in action. This is a low budget horror flick with some really original atmospheric components, that's all. For me, I'll take this film and it's shaky special effects over any modern day CGI slop fest.",Children of the Corn

122,ColeSear,A Horror Classic (SPOILERS),9,5 August 2002,"In my opinion this is a great film and here's why: Even before we see anything we feel that the score will be of great importance in this film. Aside from a slightly electronic new wave 80s score provided by Jonathan Elias the film is also scored by a children's choir appropriate and both chilling in tandem with the events that occur onscreen and with the theme of the film. 	 Like in many horror films we begin in flashback to prior event that led to current unusual circumstances with voice over narration of Job who is the older brother of Sarah. Throughout the film these two are involved in simple activities which are banned under the rules but because of Sarah's gift they generally are allowed to do what they wish. What separates this film from most of the 80s is that it's not necessarily into gore. We get dead bodies and the after-affect of the massacres. The obsession of needing to see the blade or bullet whatever it may be pierce the skin is absolutely eliminated and the result is even more frightening. 	 Joseph, a child displeased with the ways Isaac has placed upon the town of Gatlin, tries to escape but he is caught. All we see when he dies is a few drops of blood falling on a suitcase he was going to take with him on the road. Film is a medium that is at times binding to the imagination. When any director, Fritz Kiersch, in this instance allows the audience allows us to imagine what may have been done to these people it deserves notice. Another example of this being the massacre three years prior that kicks off the film we hear a mother's death over the phone and see a father's blood splatter over a son's face. 	 A lot of what makes this film great is the mounting tension that is created when we see these two trying to get around this seemingly abandoned town. 	 One of the most effective techniques Kiersch used to heighten tension while the film was progressing was the use of shots from an anonymous yet subjective POV after we knew the children were already out to get them. There's a shot through broken glass that's been stained brown, a shot of someone peering over a garbage can, low-angle shots of the corn when Joseph's being chased. He also employed time to his advantage because the young couple does not enter the town of Gatlin where all the horrors will occur until the 39th minute of the film and even when there things creep along slowly. There is a great use of wide-angle shots throughout to demonstrate the emptiness of the town. 	 The audio and visual effects of this film are absolutely breathtaking. There's a great use of what appears to be time lapse footage coupled with the audio affect of gushing wind to signify the wrath of God. Near the conclusion of the film we hear the greatest demonic voices in the history of film (In my humble opinion). It's deep, raspy and frightening without going overboard. And just when we the most psychotic of all the town's children is going to walk away from this Isaac speaks to him in that voice and delivers a line that helps make that voice: ""He wants you too, Malachi. He wants you too."" The escalating horror of the climax continues when there is a gorgeous fiery apparition in the sky and later an obviously processed flame beneath it which we assume is supernatural but to say more would be giving it away.   The end of Children of the Corn is wonderful the very last scene gives you a fright which is conceivable and doesn't seem fake at all and is probably due to some crafty editing. It takes away that artificial happy ending feeling. The happy ending in any horror movie is absolutely false because we know usually have been through a harrowing experience and it'll be hard for them to walk away smiling. Watch for the sound of the crickets and the return of a choir, this ending will run a chill through you all over again! 	 This film is also steeped in religious commentary. First, there is Horton and Hamilton in the car listening to a televangelist and mocking him and showing very good comedic interplay. They find a cross made of corn and Horton says in an offhand and stunned way ""Jesus Christ"" to which Hamilton responds ""Not in my book."" We witness a mass of those who worship He Who Walks Behind the Rows and see the irony of their words screaming at us. All the names of the children in this town Isaac, Malachi, Job and Sarah are all biblical figures. These are the Children of God-fearing people who have twisted the scripture to suit the needs of a few sick souls who are power hungry those who stand against the clan generally have no chance. Vicky is kidnapped and hung from a cross made of corn, biblical passages are written in blood on church walls the same church where a desecrated portrait of Jesus hangs. There is but one point where the film climbs towards the didactic and even so it's but a moment and almost necessary because it shows how insane Malachi's followers have gone. 	 One other things that make this film is unique is that we get inside the cult and see the way Isaac and Malachi differ. In what makes horror films fun we get to side with one of them over the other because if we were involved with them in anyway he's the one we'd prefer. There is much infighting with these two and it adds to the tension and adds a wallop to the climax.",Children of the Corn

You would think a movie about a cult of children would be wacky? But Children of the Corn will surprise you, in the fact that the story is about creepy murdering children.A young couple are traveling, they decide to stop in a small Mid-Western town called Gatlin, they find no adults in the town only children. But a violent surprise to them is the children own the town and have created a cult that worships a deity that lives in the cornfields on the outskirts of town. Now, it's a fight against survival as the children try to kill the man and woman. But with the help of two normal innocent children they just might survive.King is at his best here, you can see his twisted, sick, and absolutely amazing mind and story telling at work here. I haven't read the short story, yet, but I will. Who knew that the main villains would be children and teenagers (I can see King at work right there too). And I will be honest the children were downright creepy, all of the young actors and actresses who played them did an amazing job of giving you chills all through the film. The film scared me, yes I love horror movies, but this film kept me awake for a few nights, but that's the fun with it, and this movie is not the only horror movie that has done that to me. Who knew that children could be so damn creepy? Right? Not only were the children good in this film, but the story and plot was good as well. Eventually we find that it's not just the children committing evil things, but a main entity is in control here. The film had it's funny moments as well, the music was great especially the chanting children music that plays throughout the entire movie it gives you chills when it does play, it has it's innocence in it but the melody and chanting is really creeper. I give Children of the Corn a 9, it was good but I believe with more background on the godlike entity and deity it would have been better. I have heard the sequels are not as good, but I need to watch them to find out. And I have to warn you, think twice before you travel through a Mid-western small town that may look deserted, it just may be inhabited by a cult following group of creepy children. 9/10 for Children of the Corn",Children of the Corn

Children that kill people are great tools for horror movies in my opinion. Exorcist, The Omen, Pet Sematary, etc. Children of the Corn started off seemingly the same. The kids kill all of the adults and live in the cornfield and so on. A couple show up and try to save the kids that are ""non believers."" For a little bit, after maybe 15-20 minutes it gets a little slow but I live through it. Then it gets alittle more interesting with the whole religion thing. Showing how all the kids are just crazy religious folks who do what their leader says, showing how dangerous religion is and then it happens****spoilers****The movie goes from this good slasher/horror like film about killer kids and then it just throws all that good stuff out the window with some weird supernatural **** that in my opinion ruined the movie. Weird static ball things that crawl through the ground and explode the cross and whatnot then kills the leader but brings him back all zombie looking. I don't know it just seemed like the writer just gave up and needed something to finish the story quick and threw in something dumb and crazy. It turned it from a unlikely but possible scary story to something dumb and supernatural. It would have worked with it being supernatural the whole time or not at all, don't just add it at the end, it seems lazy.****end spoilers****in the end i guess it is a new horror classic and probably has been quite influential to the genre, i just have a problem with how they ended it, which ruined the earlier parts i did like.I wouldn't really recommend this film to anyone unless you really enjoy horror films or have heard of it and you're curious.

It was more horrific than any of thesequels could ever dream to be. The thought of children turning onadults is probably one of the scariest ever concieved, and rightfullyso. They greatly outnumber us. They are not very bright, and can easilybe swayed, as is shown in the film. What sets this film apart from somany others in the horror genre is the fact that something like this ISpossible to happen (I'm not talking about what happens at the end) and alot of people don't want to have to deal with a thought like that, sothey pass it off as just a film. It is so much more, and anyone whodares to view it will know that. Another atmosphere of this film thatgets overlooked so much is theexcellent soundtrack by Jonathan Elias. The haunting melodies ofchildren's voices combined with a classical theme mixed with NativeAmerican beats is utterly terrifying!

The movie is low budget, the cast is made up of amateurs, and the script is terrible. The music is satisfyingly creepy.This is one of those movies with a very exciting title and a great poster. The name is full of promise, the mayhem and creepiness are pretty much guaranteed, yet the end product is incredibly dull. Based on a short story by Stephen King, it had a great potential right from the start. Unfortunately, the name and the title alone do not a movie make (and it seems Mr. King felt the same way and disowned it).There are only a few memorable moments, and they have to do with Linda Hamilton, the only professional actor in the cast, apparently. There is a scene where she sings ""School is out"" and it is pretty much the only bit of this movie that is worth watching. Her partner in crime, Peter Horton, is a tall, blond, white version of Carl Lewis: he can run fast but that's about all he can do. Actually, I've seen Carl Lewis act and he is a far better actor.The script is not worth mentioning. Maybe just to say that taking one line from the Bible and making a movie out of it is not all that fantastic. Other than that, the conflict is impossible, but the idea of what children might do if left to their own devices - or worse, in the hands of a religious fanatic - is interesting.

The acting is very good, especially Linda Hamilton who went on to star in Terminator afterwards. The main problem with this film is the plot, which is rather ridiculous. The fact that a load of children and teenagers would listen to a crazed ten year old freak called Issac, and then do everything he says. This would just not happen in real life.

It takes King's magnificent short story and stretches it impossibly, to end as a long idiotic bore, with actors either wooden or hammy, moronic script, preposterous plot, lame effects and brainless directing.

137,fidelio74,Stephen King's Children of the Yawn,2,13 December 2010,"This is a really disappointing adaptation of an excellent and terrifying short story which appeared as part of American horror novelist Stephen King's first anthology of short stories, 1978's 'Night Shift'. King's story offers a dreadful sense of growing unease and a truly horrific ending which is completely scrapped in the movie version.The good news about the film is that Linda Hamilton stars; if she has ever delivered a bad performance I have not seen it. She has a toughness and a vulnerability at the same time, and is an extremely likable actress. I just wish she made more movies; I remember seeing her many years ago as the violated wife in the harrowing telemovie 'Rape and Marriage: The Rideout Case'. Hamilton made 'Children' shortly before playing tough heroine Sarah Connor in 'The Terminator', the role for which she is most famous.Burt (Peter Horton) and Vicky (Linda Hamilton) arrive in the small town of Gatlin, Nebraska to find that a small group of mutinous children led by the Damien Thorn-like Isaac (John Franklin) have risen up and murdered nearly all the adults in their town. At the unhinged Isaac's behest, they worship He Who Walks Behind the Rows, and they are not above sacrificing the odd grown up to this mysterious figure.The shadowy presence of He Who Walks Behind the Rows pervades King's taut tale. In the story, Burt is killed by this thing a few hours after he finds his wife crucified, her eyes plucked out and the empty sockets filled with corn husks. It is an incredibly downbeat and horrible ending to a great story, and draws most of its strength and power from the fact that we do not ever really find out what exactly He Who Walks Behind the Rows is. Is it human? This clever method of suggesting rather than showing horror is discussed by King in his wonderful and nostalgic non-fiction book 'Danse Macabre'. He recalls always being disappointed when a monster was finally unveiled in a horror film. According to King, your imagination will always summon a beast much more frightening than something that a special makeup effects man has dreamt up. Unfortunately, the horror of He Who Walks Behind the Rows is totally diffused by this film. Instead of some terrifying presence, we get an awful electrical current, the product of some pretty shoddy early eighties special visual effects work.But the worst thing about this movie is the happy ending. As I wrote, King's ending is far better and a hell of a lot scarier. It would have been extremely powerful had Burt and Vicky met a grisly fate more faithful to King's original vision. These are likable characters; we do not want to see something bad befall them. So a downbeat ending would have been that much more effective. The loss of these characters would have been depressing and unsettling. Instead, what we end up with is a forgettable ending to a forgettable film. 'The Shawshank Redemption' this most certainly is not.",Children of the Corn

Why am i interested in seeing what follows and what happens to these people? Why am i eager to root for the ""good guys""? Because even if the movie isn't good, and the acting isn't either, there is HORROR in this movie. Being stranded in a small town, run by psychotic children, where all adult have been killed, and isolated from populated areas by miles and miles of cornfields, is stuff nightmares are made of. There's no way to escape, you never know when one of the children has enough and decides to kill you, especially with the help of the others.Maybe the movie would have been better had there not been a monster in the fields. Children who are victims of mass hysteria, influenced by a religious fanatic, would be slightly more realistic and therefor much scarier. And if this were directed by a decent horror director (John Carpenter, Wes Craven) it would have improved even more.

The technique is absolutely flawed and proffessional dance instructors or choreographers with heart conditions should stay the hell away from this film. it's the kind of jiggle that could have never been fashionable. the kind that soccer moms purposely do in front of their kids to embarass them. and worst of all she sings along with the verses of a song that  the original writers of the song probably forgot years ago.i rented this flick because i saw the two subsequent parodies of it on south park and the simpsons in one week. i thought ""hey, this has gotta be a classic, right? south park AND the simpsons paid their respects to it."" the rest is little more than memorable. most memorable are how creepy little isaac's voice is, which leaves you wondering if there are kids like that in real life and if you yourself could spawn something so ridiculous-sounding 2nd would be the sinister maliki whose appearance is straight out of deliverance. the casting director did an excellent job at finding the most alien-looking young folk out there.  3rd what parent in their right mind would let their children be in a movie where the majority of their screen time is dominated by their child running around with sharp objects in their hands?  and 4th is the already stated horrific linda-hamilton-beliaal-boogy scene.Sure the actual plot has some good ideas- the use of empty space. the suspense leading up to the entrance of gatlin. the lack of violent excess. taking something sacred (children) and turning into an object of fear, but it's really just not well-executed throughout the majority of the film. worse, the film seems to be preaching about religious fundamentalism. i liked the religious element, actually. i thought it was a strong point- but i don't like to be preached at.i mean, all in all ""children of the corn"" kept me entertained for however long it was and the acting was good enough (especially by child actors) to keep me concerned about the characters. so, hey it's worth a gander ...or maybe a glimpse. but i would hardly call it a classic.",Children of the Corn
140,klesker,WHAT?,3,2 August 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but when reading that some people on this page have called this a classic i just laughed because i thought they couldn't be serious. To my horror i found that they WERE serious and my laughter turned into muddled confusion. I would just like to ask what is in this film that makes it any good let alone a classic? Sure it has a creepy concept but I'm afraid to say that in MY opinion that is all it has going for it. Hell even the trailer was scarier than the movie itself.OK i'm getting ahead of myself here, this movie isn't as bad I'm making out to be but it suffers from what i like to call Jeepers Creepers syndrom. This is when a very promising first half is let down by an absolutely god awful second half (in Jeepers Creepers the second half is crap coz you realize the monster is actually a man in a latex mask).This film also takes far too long to get going (ala Dreamcatcher). There is a decidedly grim opening in which the children of the town kill all the adults, and a scene where one of the kids tries to escape through the corn fields only to have his throat cut up, but pretty much from then on in (20 mins and onwards) the film goes from being dull, to boring, to stupid, to laughable and then starts all over again. And Linda Hamilton, what are you doing? You've made two of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made along with the crap yet strangely fun Dante's Peak and you chose to do this? And so early in your career too, I'm surprised you were able to work in Hollywood again. It's as if your name on the poster (after the success of The Terminator) would add some credibility to the film but alas no, it seems that nothing can save this film.And can i just ask what makes and man with long ginger hair, a mouth like Steve Tyler's and gangly teeth scary? And the fact that he's taking orders from a kid half his size, i mean how does that work? I was surprised he didn't mutiniy earlier on in the film. It also has one of the most laughable endings on the planet. Oh a red cloud coming out of the corn field.

There was NO humour whatsoever, there was hardly ANY suspense, there was hardly any good acting, there was hardly any plot building, and there was hardly ANY gore!  What on earth were they trying to create here. If they wanted to do a stupid, no brainer horror movie the least they could have done is thrown in some gore, but they didn't even do that.  The original short story from Stephen King sucked too, it was one of the worst stories he's ever written, so God knows why they picked that out to make into a movie.  Perhaps the movie had SOME LITTLE symbolic meaning, but who cares!!!  Frankly the corn was more interesting to me than the rest of the characters and the plot, that says alot because I'm a very open-minded person when it comes to movies.  This is amongst the most over-rated horror movies to ever hit the screen.  The atmosphere and everything was just terribly planned.

142,Jack Smith - The King Of Horror,Mildly above average modern horror.,6,6 October 2000,"This mildly above average modern horror is actually one of the better Stephen King adaptations. This is quite a creepy film that is quite daring by giving away the whole plot right at the start by showing all the adults in a small religious town called Gatlin getting murdered one Sunday after church. This is quite a gory scene that manages to grab the attention of the viewer without making the rest of the film a waste of time. Children Of The Corn then manages an extremely promising and fairly gory opening half an hour as a young doctor and his girlfriend (parts well acted by Peter Horton and the very sexy Linda Hamilton) get lost and get closer and closer to wandering into Gatlin and finding the murderous cult of adolescents led by lunatic child preacher Isaac and his bloodthirsty sidekick Malachi. Sadly once the couple arrive in Gatlin the film seems to self destruct. The film begins to follow a very tired formula and becomes less and less convincing by the second as the film becomes little more than a series of unexciting chases up and down a town the size of your average back yard until the ending which sadly seems to  be little more than an excuse for some now fairly unimpressive special effects. The inconclusive ending will also infuriate viewers. Children Of The Corn is certainly not a bad little movie but then it isn't all that good either. The first half of the film is gripping and contains one truly heart stopping shock moment and is worth watching just for that, the second half of the film frankly is pretty poor and unsatisfying. Children Of The Corn is certainly fairly eerie but it sadly never even tries to be seriously scary. Taking into account the undeniably lurid and chilling central idea Children Of The Corn could have been an extremely disturbing film. Tragically it isn't but it still stylish and occassionally creepy enough to be worthy of attention. Beware of the awful sequels!",Children of the Corn

Another thing is that the movie fails to make the children scary, the idea is creepy, but the execution not very good. The actors who are manly children are below mediocre of what to expect, even star actor Peter Horton makes a weak performance. The cinematography is also below par with a lot of close-ups of both people and sickles and corny angels, Gatlin town has great scenery and setting which they could have gotten way better use of.

It's been available since I signed up about 5 months ago, which means a younger generation finds this movie as interesting as original fans do. Plus the price remains right. This movie along with Halloween and Friday the 13th set the mold for the low budget horror flick. It was way better than A Nightmare on Elm street which was released the same year. COTC was universally trashed by critics, which is nothing new. If you read any of their reviews, there's no substance in the criticism. People forget professional critics are doing their jobs, and many times I truly believe they spew venom without actually even looking at the movie.Forget, the haunting theme, and creative camera work, or the subject matter from the contemporary master of horror, for just a second. Forget the cast, which was a mixture of unknowns, seasoned B actors and the up and coming leads and the fact this movie cracked the top 100 in 1984 one of the record setting years in cinema as far as box office success and critical acclaim. Instead focus on and how this movie makes you feel after watching it. Horrified and unsettled, which is exactly what a real horror film should do. If Hitchcock had seen this movie their is no doubt in my mind as a student of cinema he would have approved.My only criticism of this gem is that there wasn't more emphasis on the underlying dogma of the tittle characters. For all I know the scenes wound up on the cutting room floor. As a result the impetus for the cult seems vague, and probably could have been cleared up with 90 seconds of additional dialogue or monologue. That much said COTC is a horror flick that has stood the test of time. Just ask a millenial.I've never understood how people claim king adaptations have been so mishandled. COTC,The Shining, Stand By Me and Carrie qualify as classic. Pet Semetary and the Dead zone where good. Creepshow, Christine, Dream Catchers,Cujo and Salem's Lot where at the very least above average. Graveyard Shift, Silver Bullet, it and the Stand where flawed but at least mildly entertaining. And yes I've read all these books and stories.Stephen King has often maligned many of these movies, but this was the guy who made Maximum Overdrive which was truly awful.

160,GaryKurt101,Lukewarm Stephen King Adaptation,6,7 October 2018,"It's tricky adapting Stephen King. It's even trickier adapting a Stephen King short story. These are usually so well crafted and such perfect little slices of terror that stretching them out to feature length can only dilute a lot of their horror. Such is the case with Children of the Corn - a film that, somehow, has spawned 8,000 sequels (most of which are direct to video) and has become a household name in the years following its release. Let me get one thing straight - Children of the Corn isn't a horrible movie. In some respects, it's more fun than it has any right to be, but it's not in the top tier of King adaptations. What Children of the Corn does get right can be seen in its vicious prologue where all the adults of a small town are brutally murdered by their own children. It's a brilliant, disturbing sequence that could have been a great short film by itself. Even better, it's never said why the children are doing this. With that mystery and sense of dread established, we meet our two leads (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) who end up driving through this town and becoming the latest victims of this cult of murderous children. There are some effective moments here and there, including a rather frightening dream sequence and a few well timed jolts, but with so much runtime to pad to stretch out this tiny story to feature length, the creators have to fill it with silly exposition about a monster in the corn fields. When said monster finally does appear, it's a bit goofy.One can see why Children of the Corn developed such a strong cult following. There are images in here that are as potent as some of the best horror films, but it fumbles a bit after its initial set up. You could still do far worse, though (i.e. most of the awful sequels).",Children of the Corn

163,Enforcer686,"Not perfect, but still a cult classic",8,9 April 2011,"This movie's strengths are the effectively creepy mood in the beginning, which builds nicely to a point near the end, and the repulsive charisma of the two villains Isaac (cult leader) and Malachi (ambitious 2nd in command, all-around bad apple). Apparently it was the producer/screenplay writers's idea to use biblical names for the cult leaders rather than the more common names in King's original, good call. But unfortunately, that was the only positive contribution they made over King's original story. Actually, that's not true---they did manage to find the right person to compose the very creepy theme song, which has been in my head for the last hour as I've thought about this movie and review!!I was in the age range of some of the younger children in Isaac's group at the time this was released on TV, so it seemed much scarier back then compared to when I recently watched it for the first time in many years. My mum probably wouldn't have let me see such a movie in the theater at that age, even if I would have been allowed in! I had the same immediate reaction to the movie as an adult----Malachi makes the movie! He is the one that gives true menace to the scenes. He was dangerous enough to keep all of the children in line, but not quite enough to easily challenge the adult hero of the movie (Peter Horton), so not knowing if the hero can overcome him or not creates tension, because there is no one else that appears to have a chance of saving the day.All of the elements for a true classic are in place, and it could have made it to that level if not for the weak ending. There was really no need to attempt to give a ""face"" to the evil force worshiped by the children at the end, it would have been better implied (and no, CGI wouldn't have helped, either). To add insult to injury, after all the danger is over, the last seconds of the film are an unnecessary, dopey feel-good segment, which takes away from the dread that hung over the entire film to that point.

Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN???!!! Thirdly is the characters very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. They are bad as they can be.The last thing that make this movie bad, is that its a horror movie. You are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you are not scared, you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen. Why? THEY SHOW YOU! yes, when something is going to happen BAM you see what it is and, well, see the murder. In the scene where they are escaping through the corn field, well, I thought in the beginning of the scene it was scary but the way they delivered the scare, ruined it! They have some chances to get scary but every time they are about to be scary, they deliver it pretty badly. This has to do with a bad director who apparently doesn't know HOW to make a movie about a cornfield scary. Conclusion: The movie is bad!

All I have to say is that if you're open-minded and you're into a plot about what would happen if these kids took over (sound familiar? sounds like my home town...) then definitely see it. I, personally, love this movie, although I started the second one and I couldn't finish it because I was laughing too hard. I'll try the third one, but really, the original horror movies are usually the best and in this case that is very true. On to the plot: This is basically about two newcomers who come to this deserted town and find out that these children are actually killers and worship 'Thee Who Walks Behind the Rows', a demon in the corn fields that speaks to Issac only, the leader of the children. Of course, there's the rebellious Malachai who turns it all around for the children in the end, and then to make matters worse there are now two new adults: things really get busy! I think this is the most appealing because you pretty much find out everything as the adults do, as opposed to the other movies where you pretty much expect just all these adult killings, although I've only seen the 6th one (which should be illegal in the US because it's so horrible). But anyway, a 7th Corn Movie is on its way, and it's on Post Production last time I checked, so maybe things have turned around!

The acting is good, the plot is new and interesting, and the eeriness is great.The movie keeps you entertained the whole time, partially because of the mysterious events and because of the creepy soundtrack. If you are a fan of horror films, classic or recent, this movie is a must see.A simple summary of the movie is that Burt and Vickie become lost while traveling and end up in the small town of Gatlin. Strange things are going on in Gatlin, and before long they find out what evil really looks like! You will enjoy this movie very much, horror fans.",Children of the Corn
170,cedde6,And a child shall lead them...,5,20 September 2007,"This is the tale of a young couple (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) stranded in the deserted little town of Gatlin, Nebraska and stalked by a pack of adult killing children worshipping a demon living in the surrounding cornfields. This very atmospheric piece is a rather humble b-movie that boasts an unusual and interesting premise (thanks to a pretty good short story by Stephen King) and delivers some decent performances from its cast (which is rare with children in general). Although soft in its depiction of violence, the movie offers some creepy moments (especially in the still effective opening sequence). John Franklin, excellent as the child-preacher Isaac, makes for one odd and creepy looking kid and Courtney Gains inhabits his psychopathic Malachai character with obvious delight. The cornfields are beautifully shot and the overall is boosted by a pretty efficient score by Jonathan Ellias. And to top this all up, R.G. Armstrong makes here an appearance (albeit a too short one) as a recluse gas station owner. Don't be fooled though. The movie is far to be a masterpiece. At leading endlessly its main characters around cornfields and then through the deserted town (direct effect of superficially expanding a short story to feature film length), the movie ends up suffering from its slow pace (""Things just aren't happening fast enough"" even says Horton at some point) with the characters taking what seems like an improbable amount of time to realise what is afoot. The danger of young and impressionable minds blindly following extremist religious leaders is certainly an interesting theme but is here barely tapped into. Finally the climatic sequence, with the manifestation of the collieflower looking ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"", is a bit of a let down to say the least. Those (not so minor) details however are not enough to warrant the bad press the movie gathered upon release (and Stephen King's severe criticisms). ""Children of the Corn"" is a well performed little soft core horror b-movie that surprisingly enough spawned a franchise and still provides eerie ambiance and creepiness that even, at times, make the few cheap scares work.",Children of the Corn
171,ohkcomputer,A great movie. Also a terrible one.,6,5 July 2016,"It starts out so well. Isaac and Malachai are so well cast that they should creep most people out during the iconic opening scene. There are a few more scenes that are really well done and Burt and Vicky's introduction make them likable enough for you to care what might happen to them later on.Just the idea of children turning on grownups like this will always give me the shivers.Some of the children are amazing actors but some of them just fall flat. This unfortunately is the same for how most of the movie develops. For each great idea there are some terrible executions and I am not talking about the people who don't survive during the film. At some point the movie even seems to forget Linda Hamilton is one of the main characters as she just has no line for a very long time at all.It's almost like they shocked themselves so much while watching their opening scene that they decided to tone the rest of the film down so much that they killed what it could have become. The eerie soundtrack is almost as good as what John Carpenter wrote for Halloween which does help to keep some atmosphere doing while the film starts to struggle. There is definitely something to this movie which also explains why people keep trying to remake it.I give the beginning of the movie a 7 and the ending a 5, if that makes any sense",Children of the Corn
172,elektra33,A disappointment.,7,17 July 2001,"This was a disappointing film, especially considering it carried the trademark of Stephen King and actress of Linda Hamilton.The film starts very well with the young boy telling the murder of all the grown-ups with such unawareness of what's happened. The tension is built up nicely with our two main characters driving towards Gatlin, but things suddenly take a terrible turn for the worst when Vicky is kidnapped by Isaac and cronies. Burt's refuge in the kid's hide-out is very unbelievable....why did they not ever look in there ? - It would seem to be a prime hiding spot ?And the end......well, mighty confusing, disappointing and all-round timid considering it's supposed to be a horror film.It's not horrendous, it starts very well and does have it moments. The acting is generally good and I'm a sucker for horrors anyway. I gave it a 7/10. If you're not a King or Horror fan, you'd probably only give it a 3 or 4.",Children of the Corn
173,bigbenjr48,Sarah Connor - Vs - Satan,9,1 January 2005,"Certainly one of the better adaptations of a Stephen King tale, Children Of The Corn, for me, was a goosebump film. But all the more chilling was an unseen, Evil Force who a group of murderous children happily calls ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" (Rows, meaning rows of corn in a corn-field) The image you get of this ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" character is simply Satan with a new nick-name. And why old Lucifer has chosen to possess a billion ears of corn in Nebraska {instead of the John Deere tractor sitting alongside of it} is beyond me. Whatever the reason, the fact that he's somewhere within that cornfield gave me the chills throughout this film. More chills than watching these children go on a killing rampage throughout the small town. Anyone over the age of 17 was quickly laid to rest at the beginning of the film, and any kid about to turn 18 happily sacrificed themselves to ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"".The film stars Peter Horton and Linda (Terminator 1 and 2's) Hamilton. By accident, they enter this small town and become the towns only two grown-ups. Once spotted, they are quickly labeled ""Outlanders"" and are pursued throughout the remainder of the film until they are finally caught, bound and prepared for sacrifice.I love this film. Its had a special place in my heart for years. There is not a boring moment in this film that would put you to sleep. There are many jolts, winces and frights. And even though the ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"" fella never shows his face, you will definitely feel it's presence. Trust me. Just knowing that he's somewhere in the midst of that cornfield will be enough to creep you out.I give this gem a 9/10",Children of the Corn

177,dark_nebulae2003,Decent,5,23 October 2006,"I agree w/ pretty much w/ what everyone said here so far. The only thing that I found mediocre or disappointing were the production values. This movie, being one of the first evil kids flick that I've ever seen, had a sort of goosebumps feel to it, though it was still a few years behind that. Otherwise, it was just another 80s horror flick though the blood is minimal and the tits are absent. :( And being that this is a loose adaptation of King's short story, I never did waste my money on the sequels whatsoever. But a couple of things no one's mentioned: 1.) This reminds me of an episode of the X-files called, ""Second Coming."" I think they ripped off Children of the Corn directly because the parallels are obvious. 2.) Exactly what the hell kind of monster was, ""he who walks behind the rows,"" supposed to be in the first place? An overgrown worm that's been nuked by too much pesticide or what? 3.) And how come two kids resisted Isaac's mind poison w/out getting hurt or anything? I wonder if these people got back to Seattle and got a little unpleasant surprise w/ their new adoptees? I wouldn't doubt it. Otherwise, I think that about wraps it up for this one, y'all.",Children of the Corn
178,snafflemonkey,Entertaining slasher,7,15 November 2005,"I enjoyed this film much more than the Stephen King short story on which it is based. The film as a stark nasty tone that benefits the story being told.The story of the children killing the parents of the small town gets off to a very nasty and chilling start pretty much from the opening credits and only really falters in the last quarter of the film, where the pace slows to almost a crawl and unfortunately the film makers have gone for a happy ending rather than the one from the original story which would have made for a much more satisfying climax.For the most part this is a really enjoyable to watch though some of the ""children"" in the film look anything but.",Children of the Corn

I admit - when I first saw it I was young and it scared me (because it involved violence being committed by, and to children). I watched it again recently and I realized how dopey it really is.The first half hour, with Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton stumbling across the deserted Nebraska town - was pretty creepy. It's like a ghost town, and Hamilton keeps seeing children running around. Then, the film goes to the pits. The lead bad kid, Malachi, is so cheesily acted that I just laughed instead of shuddered, and the ending is rather stupid (with Hamilton about to be fed to He Who Walks Behind The Rows). Why there's four sequels (to date) is also beyond me. This one's for die-hard King fans only.",Children of the Corn

He told me it gave him nightmares for about 3 days. He then turned it in and hasn't listened to it since I guess. I actually got the movie on DVD, because I think the movie was well done. Just my opinion. I just don't think movies today are quite like they were in earlier years. (60's, 70's, 80's and 90's) I don't know I just don't think most of the movies have what it takes to scare me anymore. They would rather have lots of gore then scare me psychologically. What you don't see can scare you more. Anyway I'm a big Stephen King fan and I have the Night Shift book and I'm gonna read all the stories in the book. I thought Children of the Corn was good.

This movie had great acting, wasn't fake, wasn't lame, and was very scary with alot of blood and gore. It has an exceptable plot outline, and the plot outline was very unique. It's about a religon of children who believe that terrifying sacrafices are what ""he who walks behind the rows"" wants them to do that.And when a couple get stuck in the deserted town, they discover that it isn't just wierd. The children worship a kid named Izak who made it as thier leader because when he was a child he was a preacher and said he had visions of the lord. Izak has the biggest killer Matickye, who over-ruled Izak and killed him.Then the worst destruction happened. Over all, this movie is awesome and way under rated. STEPHEN KING RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

184,yet,"Poor, like too many King adaptations",4,4 October 2010,"Like too many King adaptations, Children of the Corn leaves too many questions unanswered and features gratuitous blood and violence as a poor substitute for real terror. I couldn't help but think of the Twilight Zone episode ""It's a Good Life"" where 6-year-old Billy Mumy kept an entire town of adults terrorized with his supernatural powers. Now there was real shock and suspense. In ""Corn"" the kids were just murderous zombies led by one whose only material power was an unusual ability to throw knives. Their powers were shown to be impotent against a physically-fit adult male, with only the unseen ""He who walks..."" for their back-up plan. With no outside contact for three years, who was keeping these kids fed? Besides, since their succession plan calls for a ""Logan's Run"" style of population (and mind) control, more of these kids had better started ""getting busy"" at an early age.

A few notable exceptions are ""Stand By Me"" from ""The Body"", ""Carrie"" from the novel of the same name, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption"".  This movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way.  It is no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much disavowed any connection with it.

Even though the main characters were decidedly flat, they were still interesting enough to get me through the movie.

Well all hell breaks loose and the leading man has to find Linda Hamilton who was taken hostage by that Outlander guy who betrayed Isaac.Pretty good 80's film.

When they tried to get there something stopped them, it was the cornfields which blocked them from the city (Hemingford) and turned them into Gatlin. What is it about those cornfields?

For example: There were some bloody scenes in the movie, but they never show it when it is necessary to make something look realistic. When the adult and is fighting one of the teenagers and has him pinned to the ground, the adult hits him in the face five or six times. Immediately afterward there is not one bruise on that teenagers face or one drop of blood coming from his nose. Be real! That is just one example. Another scene shows him running on flat ground, with nothing in his way that he might trip over or anything, then he just stumbles and falls on his face (very convenient to the children who can catch up to him now). There are lots of unrealistic things like that.

Then the fact that everything was messed up and no one was around should have been a sign to get the heck out of there. Vicky was sort of getting the idea but Bert was oblivious to everything. Even after going into a house and talking to Sara, he thinks it's okay to split up and stay in the town?? Seriously, if it were me, I would not have even gone into Gatlin. If I ended up there, I sure as hell wouldn't stick around to find out why I shouldn't be there. That is just stupid. It amazes me that in the end Bert actually does something smart considering the whole first half of the movie he was a major idiot! I mean, so what if someone got murdered. You shouldn't stick around a creepy town just to report it. Go somewhere else. This is just one of those horror movies where you want to scream and yell at the characters for being stupid.

Typical horror flick; music, plot and acting are pretty much the same as in other similar films of that time. It gives you chills on occasion, but there is not enough excitement as in other slashers. Leading up to the kills are shot perfectly, no arguments here. It is kind of creepy; there are kids doing the killings, that is always a bit more scary. Field of corn adds the thrill, but if you don't consider music one of the prime elements, it's just not good enough to be compared with other classics of the genre. I would say that soundtrack is my favorite part of it, as in many other similar films.

Of course, the story is scarier and even more graphic than the movie, but that is Stephen King for you.  This is a good film.  This movie made me afraid of ever walking through a corn field alone and I am from a rural community.  This probably makes the movie scarier for me.  There is only one major flaw in the thinking of this story. Why didn't any of the adults have family outside of Gatlin that would know they were missing.  This movie is very underrated as a horror film. It did spawn six sequels.  It's a good idea and film.  (If you are going to watch the sequels they have a problem in that the have no order.

197,Tspeedracr,Children of the CORNY,3,22 January 2005,"This movie was a real let down. It started off creepy enough with the slashing of some elderly throats and some mystical choking. I liked the part with Sarah (the young girl) in the beginning and her nightmares but then it went downhill, and then some. The movie lacked an explanation for anything that happened, and most of the events seemed to jump out of nowhere. The whole ""The one who walks behind the rows"" thing was an attempt to have some type of mystery and intrigue but in the end we find that it really makes no sense at all when some random monster just appears from no where, burrowing underneath the soil yeah that makes lots of sense? The worst part about this movie it that it really made no sense at all. It never explained anything that happened, like why Job and Sarah seemed to be immune to the thrall of the cult that Isaac so easily asserts upon the other children in the town. Also, why the town so swiftly became a mysterious and ""hidden"" down that yielded power so easily, such as from the old man at the gas station, in only a few days. The adults die and suddenly the town's off the maps and the sky seems to yield to the children's will, it all happens too fast and with no explanation as to how Isaac and Malachai attain their god-like status.This movie seems to be quite the cult classic, and must have done very well judging by the parade of sequels that followed in its outdated footsteps. It's really too bad, perhaps if this movie had never been created all the other terrible Sequels would not have been made either. My advice is to stay away from this movie, you'll expect too much due to its fame and come away disappointed and angry, mumbling something to yourself about the structure that plots are supposed to follow in movies. I wouldn't even suggest this movie for a laughable scary flick, I would instead shy away from it totally as it fails on both fronts, I guess the problem is it takes itself far too seriously in correspondence to its laughable plot and story and ends up really sucking.",Children of the Corn
198,phillewis91,A mildly diverting hour and a half,5,15 November 2013,"Prior to watching this, my only vague knowledge of it was the Simpsons spoof version that plays at the drive-in cinema when the kids are out after curfew. So I knew that it was about children killing adults, sort of a full length version of the end of Lindsay Anderson's If..., only without the machine guns. And with fewer public school kids. Set in Nebraska.Anyway, my expectations were duly met. Apart from the If... comparison. It really is not very much like If... at all. In fact there are definitely far more differences than similarities and I'm regretting this comparison a lot.Children of the Corn sees a good looking and paralysingly dull couple (one of whom happens to be Sarah Connor) caught up in the corn fields of Nebraska among youth with some unusual views. These views centre upon a real enthusiasm for human sacrifice to appease the gods of the corn. The lead boy, Isaac, possesses an alarming similarity to Paul Dano's preacher Eli from There Will Be Blood. Perhaps he's a direct descendant (presuming Eli had some kids before Daniel Day-Lewis bludgeoned him to death with a bowling pin).There are a couple of unanswered questions that I'd like Mr King to address. Firstly, why do the couple, after running over and killing a small child, put him in the boot of their car? This strikes me as an odd thing to do - surely an ambulance would have been more appropriate, or at least the back seat. But the boot? Dumping bodies in the boot (or trunk if you're American and have no idea what I'm talking about) seems like an activity reserved for serial killers and Mafiosos. Maybe it's a Nebraskan thing. The couple also seem remarkably sanguine about having a small dead boy in tow. If it were me, I think I'd be slightly more panicky. It doesn't help that the acting is about as dry as the dead corn blowing round the deserted town of Gatlin.It's not all bad. There are a few jumpy moments, and the soundtrack is genuinely creepy. But it falls short in almost every other area. It's not quite scary enough to succeed as a horror; not quite bad enough to be a cult classic (although it comes close, particularly some shocking special effects near the end). It is, at best, a mildly diverting hour and a half.",Children of the Corn

I have never seen anything else with a similar story line.Basically all the children in a deserted village (Gatlin) decide to kill all the adults and then a couple of adults arrive a few years later. Questions such as how after 3 years this mass murder had gone unnoticed and why all these children are prepared to kill their parents are unanswered.In many ways this film is stupid and slow in places. However it does have a sinister element and the characters of Malaki and Isaac are done very well. Quite enjoyable all the same. Just about worth seeing but not essential.My rating: 6 and 1/2*,Children of the Corn

This movie was made back in the day when the Stephen King movies actually came to theatres instead of direct to TV or something like that. The old Stephen King movies were great but the modern stuff is horrible. Children of the Corn falls in the old category. I recommend this movie highly. Just look at it as if it is really happening and think of how you would feel and it can be quite  the scary experience.",Children of the Corn
203,mesircow,"Pretty fun, if corny, Stephen King film.",7,21 February 2010,"When it comes to Stephen King's horror adaptations, the results have been incredibly varied. On the one hand, we have Carrie, Misery and The Shining; all great horror films that have become classics of the genre. Even recent adaptations of the Mist and 1408 have gained positive responses from critics and fans alike by obtaining the right mood and feel that the author intended.On the other end of the spectrum, there is the terrible film that is The Lawnmower Man. In King's defense, the story bears pretty much no recognition to the original tale and is essentially an adaptation in name only. Nonetheless, when watching a movie with King's name on it, one should expect it to be better then that garbage.Somewhere in the middle we have films that have gained mixed responses. Pet Sematary, for example, has a 50% fresh rate on Rottentomatoes.com from 18 reviews, with reviews ranging from Fred Topel calling it a ""Great Stephen King movie"", to Gerry Shamray calling it ""Another awful Stephen King adaptation"".Children of the Corn is another film that could fit into this middle ground, as it has even less critical acceptance at 36% on Rottentomatoes from 22 reviews. Despite this, it was a financial success, earning $14 million off a $300,000 budget and spawning 6 sequels and a telemovie remake. Granted, the majority of these sequels were direct to DVD, but it still shows that there is a loyal audience that existed for this series and enjoyed the films, regardless of the overall critical opinion. And let's face it, the critic's consensus never meant that much to most horror fans anyway.The story concerns a village that has been overtaken by children. The leader of these kids is a young boy named Isaac who acts as a religious leader towards the other children in the town. The boy claims to be able to communicate with an unknown force referred to as ""He Who Walks Behind The Rows"". When a young married couple enters into the town (played by Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) Isaac begins to dictate to the others how ""The Man Behind The Rows"" wants the couple to be dealt with.The acting isn't too bad, Linda Hamilton, being the most famous person here does her job relatively well, but Peter Horn I thought could do with being a bit less of a doofus. Then again, maybe that was how the character was written. John Franklin as Isaac does a pretty good job, with a creepy way of delivering his lines. Courtney Gains as Malachai, his second in command, was a bit more annoying. The way he spoke reminded me of Al Gore in South Park through his irritating whining.But acting isn't what this movie is about. The movie is meant to be creepy mindless entertainment, and it does a pretty good job. Then again, perhaps I'm just a man of simple pleasures. Dressing children up in adults clothing and getting them to speak all spooky-like is already going to do a somewhat decent job of entertaining me. Getting them to act violently towards each other and I'm totally there. The Children of the Corn is not the greatest Stephen King adaptation, but it doesn't need to be. It's a movie that you can put on late at night and just enjoy it for what it is.",Children of the Corn
204,marcleroux,'Alien' with Children,8,8 June 2006,"This is a movie with very little violence, most of which happens in one scene at the start, so don't worry if you're put off by gore. Very little is seen, much is implied, allowing the audience to imagine the horror themselves, which is much scarier! It starts slowly, building tension, in the same way as in 'Jaws', with it's music and underwater shots of swimmers and long distance shots of that fin. 'Children of the Corn' allows the suspense to build slowly, so that the audience are left cringing and shouting out warnings to the characters.This is a movie that gets it's power from the psychological terror, and the stark contrast in it's plot: Children who kill.It's well acted, with the main cast turning in great performances. You truly can believe that these are killer children, that these really are two strangers caught up in this hellish situation. It's also Linda Hamilton's first starring role, and she shows why she deserved to be in The Terminator! An eerie soundtrack, slow and gentle, sung in the delicate voices of a children's choir, adds to the tension, and underlines the eery macabre of scythe wielding 10 year olds.For horror fans, this is a must see movie. One of the first 'psychological' horror movies, well made, and the first to give us the innocence-evil theme, this movie is the foundation of the modern horror and slasher genres.For non horror fans, this is still an enjoyable and scary movie. With little gore and few of the cliché's that riddle the genre, this is an intelligent and intense thriller of a movie. The best way i can describe this movie?....It's like the original 'Alien' movie, except with children. In the middle of Nebraska, as in space, no one can hear you scream.",Children of the Corn
205,narcissa-m,The movie that changed my life...,10,31 January 2006,"Oh my gosh! Children of the Corn is my all time favorite movie and probably the only Stephen King movie that I'll ever watch.I first thought of watching COTC when I saw it on vh1's I Love the 80's. It just looked so interesting! It is so not scary, although the first time you see it, it's really suspenseful. This movie gives you a creepy and lonely feeling when the young couple is driving through the deserted town that seems to be only populated by children. The music also adds the eeriness and the theme song is really catchy! Even though there's minimum gore, there's a few startling spots.All of the characters are really likable; even the villains! My favorite character would have to be Malachai, the hot red headed killer. He is just so hot and since I've seen it so many times, it's just really sad when he dies. I also like Isaac, the really short leader who does everything He Who Walks Behind the Rows says. Sarah and Job are so cute, and Rachel (I think) she's hilarious! Sometimes I just want the kids to win for once, you know? Ever since I first saw this, I became an obsessed corn kid. I love quoting lines from the movie. I even decorated the front cover of a spiral pictures from COTC. No matter how many times I see COTC, I never get bored. If you are just as obsessed as I am, you should buy the 20th anniversary DVD and I am very lucky to own it! Thank you Stephen King for writing such a great story! I would totally recommend COTC to anyone, but mainly kids and not adults because what I've noticed is that kids tend to enjoy it more. So, anyone who hasn't seen it should.",Children of the Corn
206,lahjakori,A decent movie with many plot holes,7,14 November 2018,"The biggest mistake in this movie is that we know why these characters do whatever they do. The children kill adults because Isaac says so. Isaac says so because the demon-thing ""He who walks behind the rows"" tells him to. The demon tells to because... it's a demon, enough said. Fear is born when we don't know or understand something that's strange to us. That's why so many people think Birds (1963) and The Shining (1980) are very creepy movies. We don't know why the birds attack or why Jack goes crazy, but that is exactly the reason why those movies are so popular. Another flaw in this movie is how it seems so made up-scary. The texts ""spill the blood"" and ""and a child shall lead them"" written with _unknown red fluid_ felt a bit unnecessary, just like the dried corn stalks that were everywhere.It feels like this movie tried to make Vicky and Burt some kind of immortal heroes. In Stephen King's original short story, they end up dying, but here they don't. They just kill off the three bad guys we had and then the movie's just over. And so we get to the next thing I disliked really much in this movie. The ending. In the novel, we know that the children continue sacrificing each other and themselves to He who walks behind the rows, but in this film Burt, as our strong neverdying superhero, comes to preach how every religion with violence as the main point is wrong. Though I agree with that point, as for horror movies, I prefer the ones where the heroes don't survive. Maybe that's just a personal opinion, but I think we all can agree on that the ending was super unimpressive. It just leaves the story unfinished. It's almost like they didn't even try. No talking, no music. Just ""The End"" and nothing else. It raises so many questions that we'll never get answers to.I think the plot would've been much better if ""He who walks behind the rows"" was made-up and not an actual being. I've always been more scared by people with just homicidal minds, but never monsters. I'd like the plot better if there never was any bigger force, just Isaac. Or there could've been an adult behind all this because, after all, a 12 year old making up a religion that actually has affect on people would be kinda unrealistic now that I think of it. But the main point is that the children are not the villains if their lives were in danger if they didn't kill. There's a major plot hole there, because the movie tries to make these kids look scary but if you think it; they just did it to save their own lives from the massive demon thing behind the rows.Even though this film is full of plot holes, there are still things in this movie that I like. First of all; the town of Gatlin. The scenery is just so beautiful, both at the cornfields and in the city. I could almost smell the fresh corn. And secondary; the actors. Though the actors of our two protagonist kids were kinda stiff, I still enjoyed every child actor in this movie (or maybe actors playing children, because many of them weren't actual children). The kids actually seemed to believe what they were told and the expressions on their faces look really legitimate. Isaac's actor was probably the best thing in this movie. Though he was like twenty-something whilst making the movie, he actually came across as a child to me. His acting was also really good, and the way Isaac spoke was just - of course I have never met a child cult leader talking about sacrificing adults - like I'd imagine a character like him would talk. It's hard to explain, but in few words, he is just one of my favorite actors of all Stephen King adaptions.Children of the Corn is not the best Stephen King movie - not even close being it, but it just has that something that has been sticking with me since I watched the film for the first time. I recommend watching it, though it doesn't bring anything new to its categories. Now there's only one question. How did this piece of mediocrity get 8 sequels?",Children of the Corn

But who cares? The acting is for the most part terrible (but I did like Peter Horton's portrayal of Burt, I found him easy to identify and side with), and the story has been ridiculously padded out to an hour and a half, moving at the pace of a snail to spread out the relatively few plot twists. But this a date movie classic. In spite of everything working against it, it is an involving tale of good vs. evil. An audience participation flick. The evil children are terrifying, especially the lead henchman, Malachai, and the chase scene across town near the end is one of my personal favorites in movie history. Yes, it could have been better, and yes, Stephen King's short story was better, but contrary to his public assaults on this film, it is much much more interesting and entertaining than his own feeble attempts at adapting his own work.",Children of the Corn

The children are portrayed well in the movie. The lead roles are played honestly. A fine all round acting with an equally good script makes this movie viewable. The special effects are nothing to write home about. Sound effects are pretty good.

215,Lawman_05,Good but Clichéd.,7,3 July 2007,Well i just watched Children of the corn on DVD. Before i saw the film i had heard from my friend that the film is truly terrifying & when i saw this for £5 i thought I'd give it a go. First things first considering they inly made this with $300 Thousand in the 80's they did a very good job. The movie is a bit slow for the first half hour with the exception of the beginning. However when the action picks up you will proberbly enjoy this. One down side about Children of the Corn is that it is clichéd & the ending is very Clichéd. Also John Franklin gives a terrific performance as Anti Christ Issac. Worth watching however could do with improvement. 7/10,Children of the Corn

Pretty good acting all around. There are also some very good quotes in this movie, for instance when Isaac rises from the dead and takes Malachai by the throat and says ""He wants you too Malachai, he wants you too."" Very good acting by a kid on that part and pretty creepy. Not quite like a Halloween or Friday the 13th but right up there with the horror classics.

Prologue: To sum it up spooky cult of children kill all the adults and worship a corn deity named He Who Walks Behind the Rows. *3 years later* Burt Stanton and his girlfriend Vicky are on a cross country road trip to Seattle. Trying to push their arguments aside, they try to focus on being a couple. While driving through rural Nebraska the two run over a boy who's stumbling in the middle of the road. When Burt reaches him the med student finds that the boy's throat was already slashed when he stumbled into the road. Who is he? Where did he come from? The couple stops at a near by almost ghost-townish like gas station. The old man there tells them to turn back and go to the near-by town of Hemmingford. Discourged the couple decide to go to Gatlin, a town that is closer instead. What they find there is every parents worst nightmare!!! The towns children are a cult of murderous malcontents. Children who wield sickles, scythes, and machetes and chant, ""Spill the blood of the outlanders."" The children are led by a boy preacher named Isaac Chorner and his henchman Malachai. And they worship an evil corn deity named He Who Walks Behind the Rows. These two characters (Isaac and Malachai) alone are enough to make your skin crawl! The machete twirling Malachai, and the ""Giver of his word"" Isaac will have you hiding your head under the covers. As for the rest of the story if you really want to know you'll have to watch the movie yourself. But to it's credibility this one movie has now spawned 6 sequels. Some good some not so swell. But there is no denying that Children of the Corn is one of the best horror films EVER made. As my name suggests I am COTCgirl. I am probably one of the biggest fans of the COTC films. So take my advice see this 80's classic for yourself. Then pick a row for yourself and join me in loving this wonderful treat of a film!

I know, heavy. But for some reason this wasn't as terrifying as it should have been.You are then watching a man(Burt) and a woman(Vicky) who are traveling to Burt's new internship position as a physician. Meanwhile a child is killed and is struck on the road by the couple's car when he staggers out in front of them. When it happens it surprises you, but again no fear. They take the child and search for answers and when they're not able to avoid a little town named Gatlin they decide to go there and find answers, but they find more than what they bargained for. Children have been led to believe that ""the one who walks behind the rows"" will protect them and lead them to prosperity. This is of course false and Burt realizes this. He is attacked and Vicky is kidnapped.After an explanation from a confused believer, Burt saves Vicky and explains to the children that they have been misled. This is where it gets interesting. A beast consumes one of the children, as it is part of a ritual sacrifice and their leader, Isaac, is sacrificed as well but returns and kills the heretic, Malachai, that sent him to his doom. This was the most thrilling scene.Burt and the confused believer concoct a plan to destroy the beast. They end up removing the demon that was present and leave that God forsaken town.In the end it did have some clever shocks and it stayed true to the Stephen King short story, but it felt dragged along at points. It also doesn't provide the thrill you expect until the last 15 or so minutes.

The whole idea of the ""one who walks behind the rows"" being real also made my review drop in rating.

I mean, I guess I was kind of foolish thinking I was going to get something halfway decent out of a Stephen King film adaptation that wasn't The Shining, but this...I mean, WOW. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Things like Birdemic: Shock & Terror, The Room, and Sharknado are at least laughably bad, but this isn't even on that level. The only thing kind of enjoyable to watch in this film for me was that kid, Malachi. The way he screams ""OUTLANDURRRRRRRRRR"" with his mouth wide open is pretty damn funny. Even then, though, do I have as much fun watching him as I do watching, say, the outright horrendous special effects in Birdemic? Of course not. Other than that, there's really nothing to enjoy in this film. In the end, the couple just escapes, along with those two kids. What kind of ending is that?!? Now, I get that this probably happens in the book as well, but that's exactly my point: why was it in the book in the first place? It's a horror story. I read it because I'm a blood-hungry psychopath, not because I want to see everything get resolved in the end! Now, they could make this work by making you care a little more about the couple so you'd want to see them live through this. (Keep in mind, I haven't read the original novel, so King could have executed this better there than they did here.) But they don't. All we know is that Blandon DeGeneric and his girlfriend are going to Nebraska for some unexplained reason, and they get caught up in this mess. They give us NO reason to care about these people, and half the time, in the scenes where you're supposed to be like, ""Oh, man, are they gonna make it through this???"", you're just like, ""Uh...are they gonna make it through this? Meh. Let's see what happens, I guess. Not that I even give two shits.""

Simply because of the fact that it happens in your head, and in your head, the characters has much better acting...",Children of the Corn
231,rscottpike,The big yellow car - just a funny story,7,22 October 2006,"1978 Buick LeSabre. My girlfriend Erin drove it in high school. Her car was the exact same color with the exact same interior and the exact same 8-track tape player. She was born in 1975 so by the time she could drive, the car was funny and old- even then. Basically she and her girlfriends were watching Children of the Corn in high school, and when the first shot of the car came on the screen, they were like, ""Oh my God, Erin, that's your car!!"" and she said, ""No... wait.. let me get a better look."" Then when they showed the interior, there was no question and they all freaked out.The car had before then been nicknamed ""The boat"" because of its boat-like handling and its size and its yellow color (like a banana boat) but after that it was affectionately termed, ""The Corn Car."" The true ""Children of the Corn Car"" are Erin Matlack, Rachel Yancik and Marcia Gauvin of Granby, CT.",Children of the Corn
