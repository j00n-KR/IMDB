0,MartinHafer,"This film makes ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"" look like utopias!",9,12 July 2014,"""Snowpiercer"" is a super-depressing and violent film about a future dystopian society. So, if you are not in the mood to feel awful and see a lot of seemingly mindless violence, you might want to look elsewhere. So, then, why do I give this terrible film a 9? Well, it's brilliantly inventive. And, if you can get past the horrid plot, then it's well worth your time. Now understand that when I say terrible and horrid these are NOT meant to be criticisms of the film itself--it's just that the plot is without a doubt one of the most downbeat you'll ever see.The film is set in the future. Some idiots thought that the Earth was becoming too warm and they decided to do something about it--but it ended up plunging the planet into a horrid ice age--an ice age that apparently killed off every living thing! So, how can you have a movie after this prologue? Well, it seems that some sort of ark-like train has been constructed--one that contains people and is perpetually running. Why a train? I have no idea...even after the film concluded.The story now takes up almost 18 years after the apocalypse. Folks have been on this self-sustaining train for almost two decades. For some, this isn't so bad--their lives on the train is like a giant party. Unfortunately, however, is that the film's central characters are NOT these happy folks but people who live in the back of the train--where they are starved, tormented and killed off by folks who live further up the train. Why is all this happening? What is the purpose of their lives? Is there an end in sight? All these and many more things are what they want to discover--and attempt to when they stage a major and VERY bloody revolt. And, like a boss battle in a video game, the folks keep pushing forward for answers--and are met by progressively worse and worse foes.This film directed by Joon-ho Bong is very much in the spirit of films like ""The Hunger Games"" franchise--but even more horrible. I sure gotta respect him, as it must have been VERY difficult to film this and make it all seem so real. Additionally, the story is simply amazing--so, so very creative and mesmerizing. Even if you are depressed and hate what you see, you cannot stop yourself from watching!!",Snowpiercer
1,Leofwine_draca,Thinking man's sci-fi action,8,17 February 2017,"SNOWPIERCER is another ambitious production from Bong Joon-ho, the visionary director of the likes of THE HOST and MOTHER. The one thing you can expect from Joon-ho is to expect the unexpected, and SNOWPIERCER is certainly that. An adaptation of a French comic book, it's a post-apocalyptic tale set in a futuristic world where the temperatures are so cold that to go outside means to face certain death.The whole film takes place on a train containing a microcosm of society. The rich and upper classes live in the front carriages while the protagonists of the piece, the working classes, live like cattle in the rear. Joon-ho uses this set-up to explore themes of justice, class division, man's place in his environment, and equality for all. At the same time he crafts a fine action thriller with many unique and innovative moments.SNOWPIERCER is a flawed film and easy to criticise if you study it too closely. On a technical level, Joon-ho's pacing isn't always great and his film lacks the tension and momentum that the best of South Korean has to offer (like THE MAN FROM NOWHERE or I SAW THE DEVIL). It slows down to a crawl at the climax, for example. The director's use of shaky-cam is quite poor. Plus, the concept isn't particularly realistic and it falls apart if you think about it too much. In addition, the CGI in the outside train sequences is quite lousy too.These things don't matter when the film is so much fun on a visceral level. There aren't many films being made these days where you have no idea what to expect from scene to scene, or carriage to carriage as it turns out. Chris Evans gives an authentic turn as the would-be hero and offers the most depth I've seen from him. I don't normally like Tilda Swinton but her caricature here is a lot of fun and dominates the whole movie. John Hurt plays the usual eccentric old-timer with aplomb, and Jamie Bell is still the kid character despite the advancing years. Best of all are the excellent Song Kang-ho and Ko Ah-sung, re-teaming as father and daughter after THE HOST and stealing all of their scenes. SNOWPIERCER is an odd beast and unwieldy at times, but thoroughly rewarding if you treat it in the right spirit, offering a surprisingly dark tale with plentiful action, drama, and spirit.",Snowpiercer
2,SnoopyStyle,inventive sci-fi,8,25 April 2015,"CW7 was dispersed to cool the earth from global warming but runaway cooling has frozen the earth. In 2031, the only survivors live on board the train Snowpiercer traveling around the globe. A class system develops with the front cars being the rich and powerful. Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) is the spokesman and Wilford (Ed Harris) is the mysterious creator of the train. Curtis (Chris Evans) leads the revolt with Gilliam (John Hurt), Edgar (Jamie Bell) and Tanya (Octavia Spencer). They free Namgoong Minsoo who designed the locks. As they advance, each car holds a new surprising world.This is something different and it's great. The international cast is great with Tilda Swinton really eating up the screen. Chris Evans does solid work. Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer and Kang-ho Song all do good work. Alison Pill has a fun section. The idea of a perpetual train is so outlandish but this movie makes it acceptable. I love all the different train cars that I almost want it to never end. The second half does have some minor questions. Like why does Namgoong have to blow up that particular door? Couldn't he just blow out one of the windows? The last act wraps up a few too many things. All these are very minor and the movie's great vision exceed any of these problems.",Snowpiercer
3,Hitchcoc,Don't Think Too Hard; Go Along for the Ride,7,28 November 2014,"This movie is so full of heavy handed surrealism, it's hard to really evaluate it. If one looks at the realities of the plot, you give up in a minute. I almost did. But then you accept the fact that some guy has built a train that goes on endlessly, filled with multi-generational passengers who represent a sort of caste system. The have nots are in the back and the haves are in the front. In between are groups of military types, junkies, a preppy school, and on and on. The poor folk live on things that look like tar like Jell-o jigglers but manage to maintain their health. Why they are being kept alive is a mystery at first, but ultimately the bad guys are going to be seen for what they are. The world has been launched into an ice age through human stupidity and bad science, so no one can leave the train. The battle is never clear because it seems that its a suicide mission, but there are so many inconsistencies and plot holes that we can only look at this like a futurist ""Pilgrim's Progress"" with a lesson to be learned. Previous viewers have put forth list of these failings so I won't go into them. Suffice it to say that it's one of the most unique films I've seen, and that makes it worth our time.",Snowpiercer
4,Horst_In_Translation,"""I hear the train a comin'. It's rollin' 'round the bend,",6,15 September 2014,"And I ain't seen the sunshine, Since, I don't know when."" This is what Johnny Cash sung in his Folsom Prison Blues. And even though there is nobody out there in this movie who could hear the train coming, there is also no sunshine to see as the world is covered in ice and snow and the climate won't allow anybody to live outside the train due to low temperatures.""Snowpiercer"" is Joon-ho Bong's first American movie. He directed it and also wrote it together with a couple of co-writers. Before that he was mostly known for the Korean film ""Mother"", which received great acclaim all over the world. So obviously, a large part of the film's cast is from English-speaking countries, one of them being Tilda Swinton in a truly unique role. I heard her ""I belong to the front. You belong to the tail!"" so many times in the trailer because it played so frequently before other movies I watched. Admittedly, a large part of how much her character adds to the film is due to the makeup, but still it is one of the finest supporting performances I have seen all year.The story is definitely an interesting one. You can find many parallels between the train and today's world in terms of poverty, illnesses and rebellion. One thing I may have preferred is if they had questioned the motives and the justification of the revolt a bit more. Is it okay to kill in order to move ahead in the train? This way, it was more a bit of a black-and-white society with evil living in front. But it is never just black and white. Then again, the way the richer people stopped the poorer ones with arms and made them eat locusts without them knowing is probably a good indicator of how rotten they were. It is also a nice reference to today's real world. Nutrition is a major discussion point and probably always will be.I liked most of the subplots, such as the story about the brave (stupid?) seven who left the train and paid with their lives in the cold or the way in which those inside the train determine when a new year has started. Or the way the ""army"" switched off the lights and used infrared helmets against the rebels. The ending did not convince me that much though, it was a departure into a ""new old"" world. It offered hope, but somehow it was not what I had hoped for. It is difficult to put a finger on it precisely. Unfortunately, Evans did not really wow me and I could have done without his struggle of whether he can be a leader or not. Thankfully, this was not so important as the core of the film were neither of the performances, but really the writing and the setting. Hurt gives a decent performance and we find out there is more to it long time after he's gone. Ed Harris shows up as a great schemer again just like he did in ""The Truman Show"". The supporting characters portrayed by Bell, Spencer, Pasqualino and others were fairly forgettable. Alison Pill plays a truly weird character in a completely awkward setting during the classroom scene which was one of the highlights for me. Acting-wise, however, Swinton steals the show from everybody.Visually the film is bombastic every time we get to see the beautiful snowy landscapes outside. Sci-fi is not exactly my favorite genre, but given that, I was positively surprised how much I enjoyed most parts of the film. I would certainly recommend it.",Snowpiercer
5,Prismark10,Snowpiercer,6,16 May 2021,"After Bong Joon Ho found international fame and a best director Oscar for Parasite.Watching his English language debut Snowpiercer from 2013 leads to inevitable comparisons.Both movies look at class. The haves and the have nots that also leads to a mystery.Snowpiercer is an allegory. Set in 2031 after an ice age. The survivors or on a loop that takes a year to complete.The underclass are at the back of the train living a miserable existence. Some have had their children stolen from them.Curtis (Chris Evans) and Edgar (Jamie Bell) lead a revolt and plan to reach the engine room and confront the mysterious Wilford who developed this train.As they go through the carriages, they see the better off people. School were kids are indoctrinated about the system and Wilford as the saviour. The train has nightclubs and avantgarde restaurants.Curtis learns that the system is not just the perpetual motion of the train but perpetual conflict as well. Sacrifices have to be made by the underclass.Snowpiercer is a thoughtful if flawed film. It has some offbeat performances, most notably by Tilda Swinton with a broad Lancashire accent. She seems to be channeling Jane Horrocks.Off course Curtis should had just listened to Gilliam (John Hurt) and not let Wilford talk to much.",Snowpiercer
6,claudio_carvalho,Flawed but with Original Concept,7,13 December 2015,"The nations release the substance CW-7 with the intention of controlling the global warming, but accidentally it results in another Ice Age destroying Earth. The only survivors live in the train Snowpiercer which is driven by a perpetual motion engine created by the millionaire Wilford (Ed Harris) that lives in the engine part. In 2031, after seventeen years, there is a class conflict inside the train since the oppressed lower class lives in dreadful conditions in the last wagons of the train while the elite lives in the front wagons. The lower class is fed with protein bars only; they are oppressed and punished by Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) and her brutal guards; and their children are taken every now and then when they reach a certain height. The leaders Gilliam (John Hurt), Curtis Everett (Chris Evans) and Edgar (Jamie Bell) are plotting a scheme to reach the engine and talk to Wilford about their conditions using the addicted security engineer Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang Ho) and his clairvoyant daughter Yona (Ko Asung) that are imprisoned to open the locked doors. When the son of Tanya (Octavia Spencer), Timmy, is captured by Mason, they decide to execute their plan. There are many casualties and soon Curtis discovers that they have been manipulated by Wilford to balance the resources in the train, and why the magnate keeps the lower class alive. ""Snowpiercer"" is a flawed film but with original concept. Why the guards that keep the lower class under control do not have bullets is not explained based on the shootout in the end. Why the old people are kept alive in the lower classes is also not explained since their utility for the system is only to breed. But the concern with the global warming has been in the news along the week and is indeed a major concern of the civilized nations. Class warfare does exist in most of the societies and films about dystopia are always interesting. My vote is seven Title (Brazil): ""Expresso do Amanhã"" (""Express of Tomorrow"")",Snowpiercer
7,nogodnomasters,starsTHIS IS SIZE 10 CHAOS,8,19 October 2018,"There is an opening narration to set the stage. Scientist attempt to combat global warming with a chemical CW7. It backfires and creates a deep freeze killing almost everyone. Everyone except those on a special self sustaining train designed by Mr. Wilford (Ed Harris) who plays the metaphorical deity.The train is set up as an Eco-system with people being ""preordained"" to their roles. The system only works with everyone in their place. The first 30 minutes of the film introduces the rear passengers, i.e. the bottom feeders of society who are discontent with where Wilford has ""preordained"" them to be. Curtis (Chris Evans) is a natural leader and plans a revolt, with the idea being to get to the front of the train. The next hour of the film is the path forward, followed by metaphorical speeches on the construction of society and how things could not work anyway else.The microcosm of the train is intended to reflect our world with everyone having a position by grand design, but to say anything more might spoiler the film. Needless to say, the symbols, colors, food substances, etc. all work together very well.Chris Evans in the role of our hero wouldn't have been my first choice. His character, like so many in this film, was rather bland. I felt Octavia Spencer was under utilized. This is what happens to much of science fiction which concentrates heavily on a symbolic plot, they forget characters and use cutouts. This is where director/screenplay writer Joon-ho Bong must step up and tweak the characters. All I can say is that it worked for Peter Jackson.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",Snowpiercer
8,kosmasp,Class(y),9,5 August 2014,"This is a science fiction movie, but the science fiction part is only a disguise, because there is something else brewing beneath that. The message/story it wants to tell. And it is a very good one, one that will grab your attention. The good thing about the movie though, is that you can be entertained, but you can also cherish in the story/underlying themes it has.The acting is superb, some fine make-up that is very convincing helps too. The journey is really tough and there are not only decision to be made, but also prices to pay. But what for? It is all worth it? And where does it lead? Even if you don't care about those questions, you hopefully enjoy the movie as much as others did.",Snowpiercer
9,classicsoncall,"""My friend, you suffer from the misplaced optimism of the doomed.""",7,12 December 2019,"As sci-fi, the film offers a blend of creative and uniquely different ideas. On a practical level, one could pick apart elements of the plot that are entirely unrealistic, like the concept of a perpetual train engine that's intended to run forever. At bottom, the story line offers a dystopian, post-apocalyptic version of the kind we've seen in such diverse movies as ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"", i.e., man's quest for freedom and the opportunity to live life as individuals instead of being part of an oppressed, collective herd. One big question mark that's revealed near the end of the story occurs when Wilford (Ed Harris) states that he and Gilliam (John Hurt) were in daily contact and working together for the 'balance' required to run the train. If that's the case, Gilliam would never have helped Curtis (Chris Evans) to the degree he did to take on Wilford's, and by extension, Ms. Mason's (Tilda Swinton) security detail that threatened to take down the uprising. So another plot element to go awry there. I did get a kick out of those protein blocks manufactured to feed the masses. Pretty much consisting of ground up and processed insects, they would actually have been an excellent source of protein, not to mention essential roughage. Can't say how they would have tasted, probably would have been more appealing if they were some other color than black. I'm not sure how one would interpret the ending with the avalanche derailing the train, with Yona (Ko Asung) and Timmy (Marcanthonee Reis) positioned as the sole survivors of the train wreck. It didn't seem like they'd get very far in the frozen wasteland that would be their new home.",Snowpiercer
10,lee_eisenberg,beware the frozen heart,8,23 December 2014,"Most of the dystopian movies focusing on the environment depict a polluted, barren world. Bong Joon-ho's ""Snowpiercer"" inverts it by depicting a 21st century ice age resulting from an attempt to reverse global warming. With most life wiped out, the survivors live in a socially stratified train that perpetually traverses the worldwide tundra. The poor live in the last car, where a representative launches into jeremiads reminding everyone that they have their place in this confined civilization. Meanwhile, the train's designer-turned-founder of the surviving society lives at the front. That's when the authorities' actions trigger a rebellion...Bong also directed ""The Host"" (in which a chemical poured down a drain turns into a monster) and ""Mother"" (in which a woman tries to clear her son's name after he gets accused of a crime). Like those movies, ""Snowpiercer"" show the treatment of the bottom rung of society by those at the top. This one goes one step further, depicting a classroom in which the students receive indoctrination to deify the leader; seriously, it looks like something out of North Korea.Much like ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Children of Men"", it's an indictment of any totalitarian society. A very good movie, and I hope that Bong keeps turning out good ones.",Snowpiercer
11,jboothmillard,Snowpiercer,7,20 April 2020,"I never would have heard of this movie if it wasn't for the director Bong Joon-ho (The Host), who won the Oscar for the history-making South Korean film Parasite, it was well rated and had a good cast, so I was looking forward to it. Basically, in 2014, a scientific attempt to end global warming via climate engineering catastrophically backfired, plunging the Earth into a new ice age. Most of humanity was wiped out by the extreme cold, but the few who survived boarded a circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by recluse transportation magnate Wilford. By 2031, the passengers on the train have been segregated by class; the elite are in the extravagant front cars, and the poor live in squalid compartments watched by armed guards. Curtis (Chris Evans) and his second-in-command Edgar (Jamie Bell) have been planning a revolt for a few years, urged by father-figure Gilliam (Sir John Hurt). When the time is right, and they realise the guards carry weapons that have no ammunition, they make their move and break out, planning to get to the front of the train. They free captive security specialist Namgoong Minsoo (Song Kang Ho), and his clairvoyant daughter Yona (Ko Asung). Namgoong helps the army move forward through the train, but they end up in a lockdown with guards armed with axes, overseen by Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton). In the ensuing fight, Curtis allows Edgar to be killed so he can capture Mason and use her as a bargaining chip to end the battle. The tail army stays back to hold the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason along with Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey (Luke Pasqualino), and Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner), two parents who have had their children taken from them. They are unaware that Franco the Elder (Vlad Ivanov), loyal to Mason, escapes the tail army to rally more guards. Curtis's group travels through the first of several affluent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognise a landmark outside and suspect that the ice may be thawing. The group eventually reaches a school classroom, where the teacher (Alison Pill) is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness, just before they celebrate ""New Year"", marking one circumnavigation of the Earth. The teacher uses this as a distraction to attack and kill Andrew before Grey kills her. In the tail section, Franco uses the distraction to kill the tail army and capture Gilliam. A live feed of Franco is seen on the television in the classroom, he executes Gilliam; in return, Curtis kills Mason. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco soon catches up to them. Tanya and Grey are killed after fighting and seemingly killing Franco; Curtis, Namgoong and Yona continue onward. They reach the last car before the engine. Namgoong and Yona reveal they have been collecting Kronole, an addictive drug but also a potent explosive, Namgoong wants to use it to blow the door, believing they can survive on the outside. Curtis stops them, as he wants to meet Wilford; Curtis explains when he was young, the tail section had turned to cannibalism, and he almost ate the infant Edgar, but Gilliam offered his arm instead. Curtis wants to face Wilford to ask why he created this closed ecosystem. Just then, the engine door opens, and Wilford's assistant Claude (Emma Levie) emerges and wounds Namgoong before inviting Curtis inside to meet Wilford (Ed Harris). Curtis is shocked to be told by Wilford that Gilliam was working with him, and the staged rebellion was a plot to reduce the population to sustain life on the train. Wilford orders 74% of the tail passengers to be killed, and then offers Curtis to take his role in leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept when Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and pulls open a floorboard. Beneath are several kidnapped children from the tail section, including Andrew and Tanya's children Andy (Karel Veselý) and Timmy (Marcanthonee Reis), working as slaves to manually control the engine. Curtis is appalled and knock Wilford out and rescues Timmy from the machinery, though he loses his arm in the process. Curtis gives Yona matches to light the fuse for the Kronole, while Namgoong fights and kills Franco. When the engine room door will not close, Curtis and Namgoong use their bodies to protect Yona and Timmy from the blast. The explosion causes an avalanche that derails the train. Shortly afterwards, Yona and Timmy escape the wreckage, and spot a polar bear in the distance, indicating that life exists outside the train. Also starring Steve Park as Fuyu and Tyler John Williams as Young Wilford. Evans is a great choice as the reluctant leader, Swinton is interesting, Hurt is fine, and Harris does well in his short time as the eponymous ""saviour"" of mankind. It is an inventive post-apocalypse story, all one location, with each carriage holding a different and sometimes bizarre interior, the visual style is splendid, and there are plenty of exciting and violent moments to keep things moving, it is a most watchable science-fiction action drama. Very good!",Snowpiercer
12,Tweekums,Thrilling action aboard a train circling a frozen Earth,8,7 September 2020,"This film is eighteen years after an attempt to counter global warming has gone catastrophically wrong; it has left the Earth frozen. All life is apparently extinct, with the exception of those aboard 'Snowpiercer' a train designed to tour the planet which has become an ark holding the last of humanity and a selection of animals. A class structure has emerged with those who paid to be aboard living a luxurious life, a crew, and finally those who scrambled aboard at the last moment... these live a wretched life in the tail of the train. Under the leadership of Curtis these dispossessed rise up and head forward with the ultimate aim of getting to the engine to confront Wilford; the man who built and owns the train. They will have to fight their way there; many of them won't make it.Having recently enjoyed the first season of the 2020 TV series of the same name I was keen to watch the original movie; the basic premise is the same but there are many differences so I didn't think I was watching another version of the same story. The idea of a train travelling around the world in perpetuity with nobody to maintain the permanent way is of course rather farfetched but once one has got past that the story is pretty good. It provides plenty of exciting action and interesting characters. It also provided a few twists which I really enjoyed as I didn't see them coming. The cast, which includes plenty of familiar faces, does a fine job bringing the characters to life. The design of the train is impressive as are the special effects. Director Bong Joon-ho did an impressive job bringing the story to the screen. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody who likes action and is looking for something different; if you watched the TV series and didn't enjoy it still give this a go.",Snowpiercer

14,paul_haakonsen,Frozen by boredom...,4,10 May 2017,"I had been warmly recommended to watch ""Snowpiercer"", as I hadn't watched it before. And taking my friend's advice, I did take the time to sit down and watch the movie. I must admit that I had somewhat high expectations to it, as my friend had praised the movie a lot.I wasn't even a quarter way into the movie, I think, before I started to get bored with the movie. It just wasn't what I had expected it to be. It was the storyline that sort of didn't sit well with me, because I just found it too hard to buy into. The idea of a global ice age having killed most of the world's population, and now the survivors are huddled together on a train that drives all over the world was just too thin.Visually the movie was quite good, and the special effects and CGI effects were quite good.The cast in ""Snowpiercer"" was quite good, and there were indeed some great names on the cast list which includes Chris Evans, Kang-ho Song, Ed Harris, John Hurt, Tilda Swinton, Ewen Bremner and Ah-sung Ko.It should be said that the character gallery was equally thin as the storyline, because the characters were one-dimensional and didn't really stand out as individuals, well except for the Mason character.""Snowpiercer"" is not a movie that I will watch again for a second time, because it was a struggle to sit through it the first time. And the storyline really didn't sit well with me at all.",Snowpiercer
15,Quinoa1984,"bravura storytelling, acting, and a daring mix of drama, action, comedy, and sci-fi",10,24 November 2014,"Seeing Snowpiercer earlier this year left me exhausted in the best possible way. Not since City of Lost Children, the Caro/Jeunet film from twenty years back, has such outrageous, blatant and spectacular design been implemented for a film of this magnitude. Joon-ho Bong, one of the mavericks of the new South Korean cinema (one of his fellow greats, Chanwook Park, produces this film), decided it was time to step up to a (mostly) English-language production, adapting a graphic novel from France that wasn't super well-known but original enough to give him creative space, and even taking on a co- writer with Kelly Masterson. The results are, for me, a filmmaker taking a giant leap into making an experience full of things to think about, the train itself as a metaphor for life, and rising above the conventions into something that is visceral, stimulating, and ridiculously full of talent in front and behind the camera.How is this conventional? Well, take the basic elements of the story: the environment has become unsustainable for human life, a large portion has been wiped out due to climate change (in this case, and of course timing is everything when there's even a slightly satirical element and this has that), and the only human survivors are on a train designed by 'Wilford', an enigmatic designer of this train system that goes around the world and has created a system for people to survive... some more than others. The thrust of the story comes with Curtis (Chris Evans) along with his mentor Gilliam (John Hurt, the name a play on the director who this also pays homage to), plotting and executing a revolution - to the front of the train.We've seen post-apocalypse/dystopia movies before - hell, 2014 seems to be chock-a-block with them. What sets Snowpiercer out from the pack of a specific vision and boundless creativity with the designs of the sets, the designs of the characters, how much everyone COMMITS to this whole setting, and yet there is still room for Bong's level of super-dark humor. It's fitting that the movie features as its Korean actors Kang-ho Song and Ah-sung Ko, previously seen in the director's The Host; that too was a serious movie about a monster destroying a population, but he never lost a moment to get something in that was over-the-top or ridiculous, and yet, like a crazy conductor that is just so brazen and confident in his capability makes the tonal shifts work for the material. Case in point is a set piece with Allison Pill as a 'school-teacher' (I put quotes because, well, it's an insane scene) where she indoctrinates children about the history of Wilfred - this is massively clever as well, giving exposition but in a way that is organic to the story and part of the nature of the scene - and she sings a song and the camera circles with her and then in another beat guns come out and bullets start to fly. This is the kind of scene that, maybe by itself, feels like really bat-s***. But within the framework Bong has set up, with his characters kind of going through a train that is itself a metaphor - but a skillful one - for life bottled into different castes and classes, it's brilliantly done and, often, very, very funny. And surprising as well is Evans; in the Marvel films he showed he can portray a dramatic character well enough, though a character that works best when reacting and having to show his strength against the odds. It is and it isn't too hard to play. But here, Evans has to play the leader, but more conflicted, with more put in his way, and a very dark, troubled past just by the way people have been treated in the 'back' for so long. So that by the time it gets to 'his' scene, he has been so much into this Curtis guy that he can stand up there with the older/more seasoned character players - John Hurt, Tilda Swinton (my GOD is she great here), and Ed Harris, who has the kind of 'Wizard of Oz' role but plays it so straight and sort of down-played that it makes the exposition much better than could've been expected.I may have neglected to mention that past the drama and conflicts of the science fiction side of the piece, of going from car to car to car to get to the front and the different environments... it's a kick-out-the-jams action flick. Boy is it! It's interesting that Park is a producer, as Bong attempts nothing less than rising up to the likes of the Oldboy hallway set piece as far as plotting/executing/staging a unique, bone-crushing, heart-pounding action sequence. And damn if he didn't succeed. Snowpiercer in general comes up to the ranks of the best genre art by how it recognizes what's familiar, finds new and creative ways to get to its messages, and makes all of the characters alive and with at least some dimension (maybe some more than others, but all with *presence* which is a key here with, say, the man who is practically the Terminator but in human form), and makes an impact. Are there some logical questions to be had with some things about the train itself? Sure - it may be unrealistic, naturally, to even think this train could go on so long on tracks (who does the maintenance work on the tracks, is that ever mentioned). But ultimately, Bong says 'why carp?' Go for the ride, and it's one of the illuminating greats in years.",Snowpiercer

His previous films have included Mother, The Host and the very highly regarded Memories of Murder.Interesting and original scenario and central plot. However, the plot isn't that watertight or always engaging. It sometimes feels quite clumsy and contrived and is prone to going off on random, and unnecessary, detours.Was heading for a powerful ending but, once again, a few random detours took the edge off it.Good cast, but performances are so-so. Chris Evans (Captain America) is fine for the action scenes, but less convincing when it comes to dialogue. The talents of John Hurt and Tilda Swinton are wasted. Swinton is unrecognisable.

21,view_and_review,Snowpiercer not that Hot,6,23 May 2015,"Snow Piercer is another movie in the long line of dystopian films that have hit the big screen in recent years. Unfortunately it does nothing to separate itself in a good manner.The movie takes place in the not too distant future. Present day USA found a ""solution"" to global warming and it's in the form of a chemical that they've sprayed into the air. The chemical worked so well that it caused the entire world to enter into another ice age in which no life could survive. None survived save those that boarded a train that ran on a closed loop track that essentially circled the world.So, where's the conflict besides being trapped aboard a train for the rest of your natural life? Well, in classic 1984/Hunger Games fashion your train was divided into three distinct castes. The affluent who were at the front of this perpetually running train, the middle class who were the skilled labor and/or enforcers for the wealthy and they were literally in the middle of the train, and finally the lower class who, of course, occupied the back of the train. Still, where is the big problem? If the division wasn't problem enough then the cruel and inhumane treatment of the lower class absolutely was. Death was almost imminent outside of the train, but sometimes there are things worse than death.Snow Piercer was about finally getting some equal treatment. The movie took place entirely on this train and the different cars. Why a train? I have no idea. Somehow a genius by the name of Wilford (Ed Harris) figured that being on a train that stayed in constant motion would be the answer to survival. I don't know me personally, I wouldn't want my survival to depend on a machine that has to continue its trek around thousands of miles of unmaintained tracks without stopping. There are hundreds of things that can go wrong! We're talking about a moving machine that can't stop, yet will certainly need servicing at some point; not to mention the servicing the tracks would need and a host of other potential problems. I think underground would have been far more viable.OK, enough of my rant what was the movie like besides this apparent flaw? It was decent. Chris Evans played the lead and he was leading the poor and under-privileged in a revolt to get better everything: better food, better treatment, better accommodations, etc. The movie had a dark and claustrophobic feel to it. Obviously, living in a train is going to have that effect and it came out. There were some good parts of the movie and some ridiculous parts. All of the characters were abnormal. Maybe that was due to being cooped up in a train for 17 years. All-in-all the movie was a rise-against-the-machine, literally and figuratively, with nothing particularly special about it.",Snowpiercer
22,evanston_dad,Express Train to Hell,8,3 December 2014,"In a dystopian future, Earth has become too cold to sustain life. The planet's relatively few survivors endlessly circle the globe on a self-contained train that recreates in microcosm the world they formally knew. In the front of the train are the elite, preying on the grungy masses who inhabit the slums of the train's rear. Then the grungy masses revolt.As an allegory, ""Snowpiercer"" is thuddingly literal, but as a piece of visual filmmaking, it's stunning. The movie is so exciting and arousing at times (dig the scene where the revolutionaries rediscover the power of fire as both a tool and a weapon) that it's easy to overlook any narrative flaws. The production design is a marvel -- as the revolutionaries make their way toward the front, we see the train itself evolve from ghetto misery to opulence. The film struggles throughout with reconciling a tone of black satire with dogged seriousness, and this struggle becomes more pronounced as the film reaches its half-way point. Indeed, different actors seem to be acting in entirely different movies. But somehow it all works anyway, probably because there's obviously a strong directorial hand with a distinct vision.Chris Evans plays the leader of the revolutionaries, and the screenplay takes us to some very dark places via his character, told to us though not (thankfully) shown. Evans is rather boring in the role, mostly because he's a fairly boring actor. It's a group of actors in secondary roles surrounding him that steals the show, especially Jamie Bell as his best friend and fellow freedom fighter, and Tilda Swinton, giving an off-the-charts oddball performance as the spokeswoman for the train's mysterious conductor, who rules over his self-contained world like an unseen god.Grade: A",Snowpiercer
23,ferguson-6,A Shadow of my Shadow,5,4 July 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's easy to understand how frequent movie goers develop an affinity for certain directors, however, it's important to not blindly praise based on a name. Korean auteur director Joon-ho Bong has previously delivered a couple of artistic and interesting genre movies with The Host and Mother. His first (mostly) English language film is a sci-fi, politically-oriented action film that is based on a French graphic novel, and utilizes well known actors from the U.S. and U.K. This is definitely ""world cinema"".The basic premise is that a man-made experiment to ""fix"" severe climate change goes bad, leaving the earth as an uninhabitable frozen tundra. The only survivors are those aboard a perpetual motion train that circles the earth year after year. Onboard is a class-segregation system with the richest 1% at the front (first class) of the train and the 99% lower class bringing up the rear (steerage). This case of haves vs have-nots leads to the expected rebellion by the oppressed lower class.As the rebels make their way towards the front of the train, each car brings new obstacles ... in fact, each car plays like a new level in a video game. In between are a wide variety of creative fight scenes that allow the director to show off his visual acumen in close-quarter battles - some quite violent.Comic relief is provided by a near clown-like Tilda Swinton. Her appearance and delivery are hilarious and might seem out of place if I did not find the entire movie works better as a comedy than the political commentary it's meant to be. Each of the main characters provide enough interest on their own: Chris Evans as the main rabble-rouser, Jamie Bell as his right-hand man, John Hurt as the old-timer and Octavia Spencer as the wronged-mother. Actually the best story line involves Nam and Yono (Song Kang-ho and Ko Ah-sung respectively) as a father-daughter team with skills integral to the rebellion.While the fight scenes were well-staged, I couldn't help but think of beer commercials every time the camera provided an exterior shot of the train. Luckily these shots and the abundance of posturing and lame dialogue kept me chuckling enough that it overshadowed the high number of ridiculous sequences ... not the least of which is the final introduction to the Wizard of Oz like train engineer in the front car.Director Joon-ho Bong continues his technical advancements in visual and action effects, but he will need to deliver much tighter stories to capture a large U.S. audience. In fact, more drama was delivered by his real-life ""final cut"" battles with Harvey Weinstein than the on screen uprising.",Snowpiercer

25,zetes,Goofy but exceptionally fun post-apocalyptic sci-fi,9,7 September 2014,"A cornball post-apocalyptic scenario from the 1970s done by one of modern cinema's masters. Personally, I love me some 1970s sci-fi weirdness, and Bong is an almost flawless director, so I was kind of destined to love this, and I really did. The set-up: a last-ditch measure to solve global warming in our near future causes the exact opposite problem, and the world freezes over. All life on Earth is dead except for a few hundred people who boarded a climate-controlled, world-spanning locomotive. There isn't much information given about the very beginnings of this experiment in the end of humanity, but, of course, the wealthier passengers ended up at the front of the train and the poorer at the back, where they had little to sustain them and were supposed to be grateful just to be alive. The story of the film takes place 17 years later. Chris Evans stars as a would-be revolutionary who has come up with a way to get himself and a group of fighters to the front of the train, where he hopes to change the status quo. The film follows him and his crew (including Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer and John Hurt) as they make their way forward, going through plenty of gorgeously designed, surreal train cars filled with oddball villains and obstacles. It's all very silly, but it's fun as Hell, and Bong's direction is spectacular. Of the cast, the standout is easily Tilda Swinton, who plays one of the main oppressors. Korean actors Kang-ho Song and Ah-sung Ko are along for the ride (the latter played the little girl in The Host; she's now about 20). The film slows down a little bit during it's not-entirely-satisfying climax, but in general this is a spectacular movie.",Snowpiercer
26,trashgang,the CGI and keys teared this flick to the ground,5,25 September 2015,"The Host (2006) I liked a lot but what I just saw wasn't my thing at all. It all looked promising and did remind me a little bit of The Cassandra Crossing (1976) somehow. The story I could dig but the effects used were so cheap looking that I lost my interest in the whole movie after 45 minutes, to be honest, once after the frozen arm part. Once I did get lost of the movie due the CGI I wondered why it had to clock in at 2 hours. Some parts of the train were so weird and for me even didn't work. It's sad because I think i must take the blame seeing the score this flick gets and even in my native country this flick was the film of the year, a must see.I can't understand why CGI effects used in The Host looked stunning and here you could easily spot the CGI or even the blue or green keys used inside the train.

I remember watching Snowpiercer when it came out in the theaters, loved it immediately and now after my second viewing I still love it as much. The story represents society like it is in the real world, with lower and upper class, a difference that shouldn't be that outrageous but unfortunately is. The struggle that the lower class has to deal with compared to the sickmaking luxury others live in, it's all very well portrayed in this suspenseful movie. Not only the cinematography is of high quality, the story very entertaining, but also the excellent cast made this movie another classic from Bong Joon Ho. I watched it a second time before starting the series that just came out. I read those weren't as good as the movie but I will judge that for myself soon.

28,siderite,A metaphor for the world. Then a bear.,9,7 April 2014,"People have destroyed the Earth by freezing and the only refuge is a perpetually moving train where all of humanity is trying to survive. There is the backdrop of the revolution of the abused against their oppressors, but truly nothing is as it appears to be, it is all a metaphor.Based on a graphic novel which probably is much more complex and maybe even more subtle, Snowpiercer sees everything from social order, ecology, economy to human survival as a journey on a train. The back is occupied by the poor and hungry, the front by wealthy incompassionate creatures, each wagon a level to be gained or lost, each door an obstacle to a higher plane. There are many subtle messages throughout the film, so prepare yourself with a little more brain than for most apocalyptic movies. The ending is not really a happy one - well it was based on a French thing after all - but open to interpretation. I mean, the bear looked kind of hungry, if you ask me.The casting was interesting. Captain America as the fearless young leader and John Hurt as the wise mentor one can understand, if only they weren't completely turned on their head at the end. Tilda Swinton, doing again a wonderful role as the ""minister"", a sadistic woman with a travesty of grandeur completely betrayed by her slum accent. But then you have Luke Pasqualino, trading the noble musketeer with the agile knife assassin and Alison Pill, who is a bit psychotic; then again, no surprise there, either. Both South Korean actors are very good in their roles, even if the roles, well, kind of squeaked. Ed Harris makes a short but impressive play at the end, as the ruler of the train. God, so to speak.Bottom line: I feel that I have to read the comic book to fully understand the film. I liked the fact that, even if not willing or able to ""get"" the metaphors, there is still the underlying action and human emotion that sort of works on its own. The special effects are not ubiquitous either, and appear only where they matter for the story. All in all, a good movie that I would recommend to others, but it helps to always keep in mind that it is all metaphor, otherwise there would be quite a lot of holes in the plot.",Snowpiercer
29,StevePulaski,"Emotionally vapid melancholy triumphs human interest, yet again",6,14 March 2016,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Nenko Manolov for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It."" Snowpiercer's cinematic beauty stems from two distinct places, the first being Hong Kyung-pyo's crisp, often gritty cinematography and the second being the hierarchical power structure in the film depicted through horizontality rather than conventional verticality. It's a film that's so focused on these two features that it forgets to humanize the middle-man, the men and women inside the long, ostensibly endless locomotive that is trudging along through the brutal cold, housing civilization's last batch of humans that managed to survive a catastrophic ice age produced by climate engineering. The end result is an admirable slice of ambition that unfortunately settles for the strengths of its aesthetics and symbolism to carry what should've been a far more engaging story.The class structure of the Snowpiercer train has the wealthier, more privileged in the boxcars near the front of the train, while the poorer, more lower-class patrons ride in the caboose cars, where heating and adequate food are both in short supply. As a result, with children being taken from their families and the elderly being abused, an uprising begins to occur on the train, led by the likes of Curtis (Chris Evans), one of the lower-class passengers. Curtis decides the only way that anything will change is if him and numerous others violently charge their way to the front of the train, an idea so crazy that it just might work.The Snowpiercer is governed by both Minister Wilford, played by Ed Harris, and Deputy-Minister Mason, played by Tilda Swinton, in a lively, Stanley Tucci/Hunger Games-style performance in that it's so bonkers that it can't help but be effective. The two are appalled by Curtis's efforts to disrupt the system that has worked in their favor for so long, which helps make this uprising a full on battle when the revolutionaries begin gaining traction. What unfolds is a bloodbath aboard a neutral vehicle of transportation that chugs along through the miserable conditions, housing ugliness all the way down the track.Kyung-pyo's cinematography captures the dirty, claustrophobic environment of the train incredibly well. When we are occasionally blessed with glances of the outside world, we see a whole other achievement in cinematographical clarity and focus and that is the limitless whiteness that awaits us outside. Just from the look of the environment, we can almost feel are skin turn raw and red from the brisk conditions, which are evidently so bad, a man's punishment is to expose his full length arm to the outdoors, which results in it freezing and being smashed off with a battle-axe by Wilford. Such gruesome, unconscionable ugliness is beautifully captured by Kyung-pyo.Then there's the aforementioned, ever-present symbolic presence of horizontality, which houses the structure of the class system just by its nature. This is more unique than most casual moviegoers would assume because we're so used to just accepting visions of power and status being communicated in more dense urban areas and heavily populated communities via the incorporation of skyscrapers and their inherent verticality. The horizontality present symbolizes the never-ending pursuit of a person who starts from the bottom (the caboose) and works his or her way up to the top (the leading car) through persistence and fight, only instead of a metaphorical ""rise to the top"" there's the grittier, more tiring ""walk to the front."" Director Bong Joon-ho works to profile this in a way that subverts the usual power convention by turning one of America's oldest means of transportation into a powerful, visual metaphor.The most unfortunate thing is that both of these strong components are housed in a film that isn't always particularly captivating. Often the film's attitude and tone is just as unequivocally grim and melancholy as the outside of the train, but not in an emotionally powerful way. While Joon-ho (who also serves as the film's screenwriter with Kelly Masterson) and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo make Snowpiercer a riveting film visually, it's a film that lacks in illustrating compelling characters. Films about revolutions, revolutionaries, and uprisings are only as interesting as those involved in them, and while scenes of people being beaten, bludgeoned, and brutally killed are hard-hitting, if we don't know the characters behind them, it essentially fuels the facelessness the powerful regime intends to keep in place for its people. Despite Curtis being in nearly every scene in the film, his character is interchangeable because Joon-ho and Masterson don't seem to write one for him, in addition to most of the other characters in the film being very loose, indistinct souls with very little personality whatsoever.Films like Snowpiercer aggravate me because they have all the components in place, yet skimp on the emotional relevance of the picture and the ultimate reason as to why we should care about these characters and their struggles as people. Even Joon-ho's tonal shakeup at the end, where the film's depiction of the interworkings of the upper class feels like a more adult version of The Hunger Games would've been more forgiving had there not been such a disconnect with the characters in the film. As it stands, Snowpiercer is a strong showcase for aesthetics, but a mediocre to average showcase for human interest.Starring: Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton, Song Kang-ho, Ed Harris, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, and Ko Ah-sung.

30,lasttimeisaw,Snowpiercer - an expensive expedition on human sociology.,7,4 April 2014,"One may not truly enjoy this South Korean director Joon-ho Bong's first English-speaking film, if he or she is persistently bugged by the illogical and unscientific milieu of its source comic book series ""Le Transperceneige"" - all extant human beings are dwelling on a non-stop train ""Snowpiercer"" in the near future, which energized by a perpetually functional engine. But if one can accept the premise, this coach-by-coach advancing insurgence will be a haunting roller- coaster ride with an untenable final twist. Better to deem it as an incisive allegory of a post-apocalyptic dystopia, where schism ensues from the dissonance between the lowest class and the absolute power, and certainly a revolution is working in progress. Shepherded by Curtis (Evans), a born leader and his second-in-command Edgar (Bell), the destitute from the tail section decide to start another uprising to overthrow the autocracy of Wilford (Harris), the owner of Snowpiercer and the mastermind who invented the sacred engine and stays in the front section, and will not condescend to set his foot on the sordid and overpopulated barracks of the tail. So Curtis has to lead his posse to meet Wilford, with a helping hand from the gate-opener Namgoong Minsu (Song) and his clairvoyant daughter Yona (Ko). There are a slew of polished action sequences including the modish slo-motion battle with gangs of axes, the slaughter inside a multicolored children's classroom and an engaging combat in the sauna room, the violence is relentlessly piercing through and body counts are increasing, but the editing sometimes jumps and cuts in a wanton manner which hurts the consistency of the ongoing process, in particular, the torch relay part is edited out of place with the scrimmage in the pitch dark.Chris Evans has been offered a rare opportunity here, a slick action star aside, his monologue about the appalling cannibalism simply is by far his career-best, one can sense the monster inside him, that's why the optimistic coda feels like short-changed, since Curtis is not a pure symbol of righteousness, his dark side should be harnessed as an heir of Wilford's egocentric philosophy, I wish Bong could have been bolder, using children as the trigger for a sea change in the nick of time is a run-of-the-mill tactic. Most of the supporting cast are expendable pawns, Bell is a rattling blabber, Hurt is the wise guy with hidden secrets while Harris is a not-so-persuasive smooth talker and Spencer is a doughty mother who can bludgeon. Song and Ko pair (from Bong's THE HOST 2006, 7/10) plays a more essential part representing a more pragmatic approach to escape from the train when weather condition ameliorates, which is the hope befalls eventually, but a true scene stealer is Tilda Swinton, almost unrecognizable by the horrendous makeup and dentures, portrays a borderline cartoon-clown with a great deal of zeal and zaniness.""Snowpiercer"" echoes Noah's ark, elsewhere is an inanimate frozen land and inside it is a microcosm of human society, the special effects of the vast expanse of snow-covered earth viewed through the window is impressive (it is the most expensive film ever made by South Korea, so at least they should put the money in good use) yet a tad monotonous, and the various tableaux of different coaches encapsulates the discrepant nitty-gritty of both high and low classes, pitifully, there is still no place for middle ground majorities.",Snowpiercer

The surviving members of the planet exist on a locomotive with perpetual motion engine that speeds around the globe, never stopping. The train has an in-built class structure which has the privileged at the front and the lower class occupying the rear. Unrest breaks out and a rebellion begins from back to front.Based on a graphic novel I have never heard of, Snowpiercer is the English language debut feature from Bong Joon-ho, the director of The Host (2006). It's a dystopian sci-fi film that uses the idea of this super train as representing a microcosm of the hierarchical system we see everywhere in the world, where there is a pyramid structure where everyone knows their place. In fact the very fact that the train travels round in an endless cycle reinforces the idea of the class struggle being fought on an endless loop. History repeats itself and nothing ever significantly changes. In fact it is revealed that the leader is a puppet master who has orchestrated past rebellions as a means of controlling the population. The dystopian world on the Snowpiercer is a combination of fascism, capitalism and communism.The story is structured as such that the film progresses up the length of the train, wagon by wagon. Each new carriage presents a new aspect of this self-contained world and it allows the filmmakers to vary the points they make as well as the set designs. It's overall, quite a successful movie that will probably prove to be more of a sleeper hit than a blockbuster; such is its darker tone. It benefits too from a couple of strong performances from Ed Harris as the man at the top of the train and, best of all, Tilda Swinton in a scene stealing performance as one of his all too willing underlings.",Snowpiercer

Especially with ""The Last Stand"" another Korean directed movie that ended up being disappointing. This film is exciting, tense and entertaining. It has depth to it as well that doesn't go in the cookie-cutter direction even if the message has been done before. Watching this movie was like watching a cool video game with substance. The plot is about after the global-warming experiment goes around, all the landscape freezes over and the only remaining survivors are on a train. However there is a hierarchy where the survivors in the back of the train are treated as rats and the further up in the front, people are living a more stylish and better life and the people in the back tries to fight their way to the front and break through the corrupt hierarchy (or balanced hierarchy by the people in the front of the train). There is a raw sci-fi thriller and mystery that keeps building and building. The director Joon-ho Bong did a fantastic job and glad Park Chan-wook also was part of this film. Since he added the necessary vibe and artistic psychological rawness to it. Song Kang-ho is also in this, but he is basically in it to reach out to the Korean audiences in my opinion and could have been played by another actor that speaks fluent English.

It stars Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho (who's previously worked with the director multiple times before), Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Octavia Spencer, Ewen Bremner, Go Ah-sung (who's also worked with Bong before) and Ed Harris. It was released in South Korea last August, where it more than doubled it's $39 million budget and broke box office records there. It was supposed to have a wide theatrical release here in the US, as well, but Bong refused to make the cuts and changes that the Weinstein Company (who purchased the American distribution rights) demanded. So instead the film received only a limited release in art house cinemas (it also debuts on VOD later this week). I found it to be an immensely entertaining sci-fi action flick. The film begins 17 years after global warming struck the planet (in 2014). Humanity tried to save itself, through an experiment gone wrong, and instead caused a new ice age. The only survivors boarded a train, which circles the entire planet (throughout the year). A horrible class system was developed, which divided the poor people to the back of the train (surviving in horrendous conditions) and the wealthy people to the front of it (living in luxury). Curtis Everett (Evans) leads the latest rebellion, of the poor, to take over the train; by overcoming guards and fighting their way to the front of it. The super train is called the 'Snowpiercer', by it's inhabitants.Like all great science fiction the film of course has great social commentary; not only on global warming (and our meager efforts to try to prevent it) but also on the increasing separation of the very wealthy and the starving poor. It's of course extremely exaggerated (and the film does get very fantastical at times) but it's still an excellent examination of where life on this planet could be headed. What I like even more than the political message of the film is just the action. It's pretty violent but it's a lot of fun and it's so refreshing to see an old-school action movie rather than another big budget CGI filled one. Bong's stylistic directing is superb, Evans is great in the lead and the story does have a lot of surprising (and clever) twists and turns. Tilda Swinton is also amazing in the movie; giving a very cartoonish performance but still a very memorable one. The whole movie is just extremely entertaining; the perfect summer popcorn flick. It deserved a wider release! Screw Harvey Weinstein!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9aLxA71Z4k",Snowpiercer
34,cherold,an allegorical sledgehammer,5,30 November 2014,"Snowpiercer is a very odd movie, beginning as a gritty action picture but turning at some point into a surreal Felliniesque satire and finally trying to combine the two forms in the end. The shifts in tone feel odd, and while individual scenes are quite good, with some crazy, over-the-top action and some darkly humorous moments (notably the classroom scene and everything with the entertaining Tilda Swinton) the movie lacks cohesion. It also lacks logic to a startling degree. Nothing in it stands up to analysis. The ""twist"" at the end is both unsurprising and completely implausible; the governing structure of the train is absurd on multiple levels, with all logic thrown out in service of a ham-handed message.In most allegorical movies one is left with questions about the ultimate meaning of the film, but such is not the case with Snowpiercer, whose messages about elites versus the masses and the foolishness of powerful men are so clear that a child would think them too obvious. This is the sort of movie that makes one wonder about film critics, as most declared it a masterpiece. One critic even specifically admired it for not insulting the audience's intelligence, which suggests to me that the critic simply wasn't smart enough to realize how dumb this movie is. (User reviews, on the other hand, fall all over the map; movie reviewers tend towards more sheep-like behavior).If you can turn off your brain entirely and just enjoy the movie as a striking visual journey through a weird train with some cool snow scenes through the window, well, it's not a bad little movie. The problem is this movie doesn't want you to turn off your brain; it takes itself very seriously and wants you to go, ""oh wow,"" every time there's a ridiculous, unconvincing twist. It's just a really dumb, decidedly messy movie. Watchable, but not much more.",Snowpiercer

It sounds like a fairly familliar plot, but in 'Snowpierver', there's an unusual twist: the entire story takes place on a train. Why? How? These question are never really answered, although the film does benefit from some striking visuals. But the plot makes little sense: the people live off insects (but where do the insects come from? and what do they live off?); the heroes plan to escape by blowing open the doors, but in the end, the train just crashes when caught in an avalanche while seemingly passing through the Himalayas; and the happy ending, where man is rapturously reunited with nature, takes the form of a sighting of a (presumably very hungry) polar bear.

37,MOscarbradley,A cult classic in the making.,8,26 February 2020,"""Snowpiercer"" is the Bong Joon Ho movie that many people have never heard of. He made it in English in 2013 and it's an ultraviolent dystopian sci-fi picture that takes place entirely on a train hurtling through a frozen landscape without stopping and standing in for the world at large, a world ruled by a single figurehead and divided by class. It's certainly imaginative and splendidly cast. Chris Evans, John Hurt, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer and Joon Ho regular Kang-ho Song are the good guys, in other words the lower classes condemned to the train's grim rear while Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris typify the ruling class, up front with the sacred engine and fundamentally it's about the revolt that occurs when those at the back decide to move to the front. If Joon Ho's Korean films are the ones for which he'll be remembered this is the one that might stand out as the cult favourite. It may be a Midnight Movie but it's one with heart, soul and chutzpah to spare.",Snowpiercer
38,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"A diverse, daringly dark dystopia.",7,4 May 2018,"Bizarrely, almost criminally, 'Snowpiercer (2013)' never got either a theatrical or a home-video release in the U.K., despite being a bona fide multinational, though somewhat smaller, studio picture. Yet, it is easily one of the smartest and most entertaining science-fiction films this side of the decade. The central dystopian conceit isn't entirely unique, yet feels fresh enough thanks to some exciting injections of bold ideas and daringly dark implications. The action is sometimes a little too shaky to be entirely legible, but when it becomes stripped back and focused on tension - in a brilliant, pulse-pounding sauna sequence - it really gets you on the edge of your seat. The feature also isn't afraid to showcase its odd, satirical quirks or settle down for a slower third act that's mostly dialogue driven. It really is a diverse offering to others in the genre. 7/10",Snowpiercer
39,bowmanblue,Something actually a bit different,8,7 May 2019,"I didn't really know what to expect when I sat down to 'Snowpiercer.' It's fair to say that I'm a little late to the party as I never heard about it when (and if?) it was ever released in the cinema. Therefore, much of what I heard about it came through word of mouth and via the internet, promising it to be a 'cult classic.' Now I've watched it, I can say the internet is - overall - pretty accurate.In the future the world has suffered from one hell of a freak snowstorm due to climate change and the last of humanity speeds round the world on board a train, tethered to a single set of circular tracks. Now, if your first question is something like... do the train tracks go all the way across every ocean? Then you're not the only one wondering things like this. In fact, it's worth saying that the more forgiving you are of the details then the more you're going to get out of it.Unfortunately, the train isn't all 'First Class.' In fact, the rear of the train is filled with those unfortunate enough to be forced to exist on scraps and weirdly-produced 'protein bars,' while those closer to the front get manicures and swimming pools. Yes, it's fair to say that there's a 'class system' in play here. And, quite naturally if you're one of those who isn't getting their hair done at the on board salon, many at the rear are looking to revolt and take over the train. Chris 'Captain America' Evans is one man forced to be back there with the 'proles' and he, along with a group of others (mainly John Hurt and Jamie Bell) set about a plan to redistribute the resources at hand a little more evenly.The film has a reasonable amount of action in it, but just not quite enough to be considered an 'all out' action flick. It's almost more like a two-hour episode of TV's 'Black Mirror' which presents a dystopian vision of the future and lets the viewer along for the ride. I've seen a lot of negative reviews for 'Snowpiercer,' but they all seem to dwell on the plot holes (of which there are many if you care to look for them). However, I preferred to immerse myself in the general atmosphere (of which it's actually pretty tense - if depressing!) and just go along for the ride.There's quite a lot in there that you may not see coming. And by that I mean some pretty dark moments which are quite memorable, if for all the wrong reasons. Chris Evans doesn't do much apart from grumble and brood through the film, but does actually shine at the end when you find out a little more about him than you originally figured.It may not be for everyone, but it's certainly got a different look, feel and vision of the future to make it worth at least a watch. It's a couple of hours long, so possibly a little longer than your average action/sci-fi flick, but if you keep your mind open and go along for the ride it should certainly be better than taking the average overcrowded commuter train full of screaming kids on a Bank Holiday weekend.",Snowpiercer
40,ThomasDrufke,Another Refreshing Sci-Fi Post Apocalyptic Film,8,11 November 2014,"Just as Edge of Tomorrow/Live Die Repeat kept the alien invasion genre fresh, Snowpiercer keeps the post apocalyptic genre entertaining and unique. I really haven't seen a film like Snowpiercer. The whole film takes place inside a train and once you get passed how unrealistic the whole scenario would be, then you have yourself a solid film.Not that any post apocalyptic film is truly realistic considering we really don't know what's going to happen to us, but there was something about the incredible amount of work that would have to be put into the detail inside the train that took me out of the film for a bit. With that being said this is an incredible action film. The CGI outside of the train was sub par but the fight choreography inside was unparalleled. The cast was another highlight and surprisingly many big name actors are involved with a property that was relatively unknown. Chris Evans proves once again he can act outside of Captain America, and actually showed an emotional side of his acting I didn't know he could pull off.Ed Harris, even with a small role, demanded attention as the main villain and shared the best scene of the entire film with Chris Evans. I will say even as emotional as the film can get, I didn't feel as much for the supporting characters as the film asked. Some main deaths weren't as effective as they should have been. But Snowpiercer gives us so many surprises story wise. It's almost as if each train car we pass we are given one more nugget of useful information. I give this film a lot of credit for being original and daring enough to take us to places that it does.+Original story +Evan's acting talent displayed +Fight choreography+Harris and supporting cast..-..Sadly their characters are a bit underdeveloped -CGI can be iffy8.0/10",Snowpiercer
41,Cineanalyst,The Truman Train,7,12 December 2019,"I rewatched ""Snowpiercer"" after recently seeing writer-director Bong Joon-ho's latest movie, ""Parasite"" (2019). Despite the dystopian sci-fi, ""Snowpiercer"" is simpler, but it's interesting how both visually depict literal, geographical class stratification. ""Parasite,"" a twist on the upstairs-downstairs, master-servant drama, features a poor family that descends stairs to arrive at their semi-basement hovel, whereas they ascend steps to reach the home of their employers. In ""Snowpiercer,"" the poor reside at the back of the locomotive, while the wealthy occupy the front cars. In both, a group of lower-class people travel through both worlds, of haves and have-nots. There's more to the landscape of ""Parasite"" than staircases underscoring the social commentary, and the message, too, is more nuanced. That the rich are exploiting the poor in ""Snowpiercer,"" however, is bluntly obvious, with the train being run on a system of theocratic feudalism. Moreover, these front-car villains are cartoonish (albeit wonderfully so in Tilda Swinton's case) , and the heroes, for the most part, Captain America included, aren't. The dystopian sci-fi, too, is largely and merely a framework for action scenes, which admittedly can be entertaining.What I particularly like about ""Snowpiercer,"" though, also involves the train. Ever since the Lumière brothers' 50-seconds-long film of the arrival of one at a station in 1896, trains have held an important place in cinema. They are two mechanical inventions of the 19th century that move by tracks (that is, actual film did) and provide passing, framed views--one upon a screen, the other through a window. Some of the first moving-camera shots in film history were phantom-ride views from trains. This analogy works rather well in ""Snowpiercer."" The poor live in the darkness of the window-less back of the train, and they marvel at the passing scenery though the windows of the front cars--sometimes taking a break to do so from their journey to the engine. Intriguingly, there is an actual film-within-the-film here, but it's utter propaganda in reverence of the conductor, Wilfred, and the ""sacred engine,"" while also serving to indoctrinate the children into the divinely-ordained social order. The TV screen in this case, then, is a lie, whereas the windows shed light. Even those views are framed and limited by position, though. The ultimate truth is beyond the sight of the train. Ordinarily, I wouldn't think such a metaphor necessarily intentional by the filmmakers; Bong's picture, however, casts Ed Harris as Wilfred. Essentially, Harris plays the same god-like role here that he did in ""The Truman Show"" (1999), which is all about manipulating the boundaries between reality and illusion. Harris is the on-screen surrogate for the filmmaker, and, again, he is taking us for a ride.",Snowpiercer
42,gbill-74877,Great satire,8,20 June 2020,"""We must all of us on this train of life remain in our allotted station.""A great satire of the wealthy and the rationalization used to preserve the status quo, which is all about preserving the preordained order and ""necessary"" to oversee humanity's worst instincts, completely oblivious to their own greed, or how unfair and cruel the system is. Doing anything and everything to maintain their position - brainwashing kids in school, allowing the well off to revel in hedonistic excess, and using violence as a distraction - it all rings true. Bong Joon-ho captures the zeitgeist of the times, and I love how he pushes the boundaries of the story from a literal perspective to make his allegorical points.",Snowpiercer
43,g-bodyl,One of the Greatest Recent Sci-Fi Films!,10,9 June 2015,"Everyone knows the story of this film, Snowpiercer and how there was a battle on which cut to be released. Luckily, we got ourselves the right cut, because this is a magnificent sci-fi film that is energetic, emerges with potent themes, has an eclectic cast, has some horse-powered action scenes, and in all a very entertaining film. The first half of the film describes the class struggles amongst the train society, and the second half of the film consists of some major action pieces as we slowly advance up the class system. The ending is a mind-blower, so hold on to your hats when you take this chilly ride.Bong Joon-ho's film takes place in 2031 after a failed experiment resulted in the extinction of life, except for those who boarded the train, Snowpiercer. On this train, a class system arises where we have the poor, the middle-class, and the rich. Curtis Everett is looked upon by many of his lower-class peers to lead a revolution against the wealthy, front-of-the-train people.The film has a marvelous cast, especially for a South Korean film. Chris Evans does a wonderful job as Curtis. Think of his character as a hard, R-rated version of Captain America. I really, really enjoyed Tilda Swinton's performance. She is known for taking such diverse roles, but her role as one of the villains is just too good to come true. We also get strong supporting turns from the likes of John Hurt, Jamie Bell, and Ed Harris.Overall, Snowpiercer is one of the greatest science fiction films to have come out this century. Many sci-fi films of late has been dealing with space (not a bad thing), so it's nice to have one set amongst the confines of Earth. There are some important themes to keep an eye on, mainly involving class struggles and capitalism. I love intellectual sci-fi films and it shows that intelligence and action can fit well together when done right. And this film was done right by the highest standards.My Grade: A+",Snowpiercer

45,secondtake,"I'm sorry, but this looks and feels great but is just stupid stupid stupid",5,16 December 2014,"Snowpiercer (2014)The good: great set design! Yes, that means a lot. I mean, this is kind of a stupid movie. It has a catchy plot, even if completely ludicrous—a train is on a winding track throughout the entire planet, circling by magic only once a year (that's a very slow train, even with all the twists implied). And in this post-apocalypse world (yes, another one!!!), the last vestiges of humanity are on this train, which by some twist of perpetual motion machinery keeps going for 17 years, non-stop.Okay, if you don't think this is stupid already, read someone else's review. I didn't like this movie. But I did like the sets. Yup. At first we are limited to the back of the train, the lower classes living in true, cramped, degenerate poverty. I mean, they're stuck for 17 years on the last couple cars of a train, what do you expect?Eventually, the heroes know they need to make it to the front of the train and finally (after 17 years) they hatch a plan. Storm ahead with lots of bravado and a few quick knife wounds. Good thinking!! And so we gradually (!!) move forward through this long long perpetual motion train. And the cars become really really interesting—food processing units, a colorful elementary school, crazy hedonism, old-school Euro-trains with drapes and wood paneling, and eventually the engine of it all.Meet Ed Harris. In some ways he's meant to rescue this things—in some ways he does! Well, no rescue is possible, but our interest is renewed, briefly. The improbabilities continue, however, and the joke of it all (if you can escape the aura of ""wow"" that the set design pulls off) wins the day, right up the polar bear. Yeah, a spoiler, I suppose.Sorry, but to those fans who love this movie, I wonder mostly why. Beyond how cool it looks. Oh, yeah, there's the idea of being the underdog and fighting the evil institution that rules them (just like a dozen recent movies, literally, like ""The Hunger Games"" which is far more compelling, and which inspired this to some extent, especially the fabulous Tilda Swinton character). If you like this dystopian stuff even if it's about as deep as the reflection on your Samsung, go for it. But if you look for, uh, character, plot, acting, and creativity, forget it. Move on.

This is an idea that has been done many many times before, A group of oppressed citizens rebel against the wealthy. While the movie was basically OK you can only do the same idea so many times before it loses the impact it wants. My biggest problem with this movie is that it starts in the middle and you are trying to play catch up as to what is going on for the entire time. Even a little blurb in the beginning that you had to read to get the back story would have been good. Halfway through you get a history lesson but up until that point you feel lost and that hurts the movie in the way that you can't really get connected to the characters or the movie from the beginning. Other than that though the movie isn't terrible and sci-fi fans will like it but for me it was just too slow moving and never really settled into what it wanted to be for me to fully get invested in.

50,atlasmb,A Great Adventure Story,8,5 August 2014,"If you are wondering what genre this film falls into, it is first and foremost an action film. If I had to predict what group of people will most reliably enjoy this film, I would say those who enjoyed ""300"". It is, after all, one long battle scene, punctuated by plot twists.The plot twists are good, effectively making the film (also) a mystery. From the first minutes of the film, there are questions to be answered, riddles to be solved, and some out-of-left-field surprises.It should be noted that the action includes plot holes and questionable physics. And for the many who wish to view this film through the lens of economic politics or social commentary, there are other inconsistencies. Of course one can struggle to reach some Frankenstein monster of a patchwork theory about the plot's ""true underlying meaning"" if one wishes to.The fact that there are so many unanswerable questions does not detract from the film if it is viewed simply as a myth-based adventure about a hero in a hostile world. The story takes place on the self-contained world of a train, so the ""rules"" of the myth are easier to control. Graphic novels have inspired a few films, some of which are dedicated to the recreation of the graphic images on film. If you appreciate the artistry of ""Sin City"" for example, you might also appreciate the recreation of the atmosphere of a dark dystopian world. ""Snowpiercer"" does that very well. It is aided by some wonderfully atmospheric incidental music. One cannot help wondering about the logistics of a totally self-contained world. ""Snowpiercer"" gives us wonderful images that explain some of our questions. But this is mythology, so it does not try to cover all the bases.

51,The-Sarkologist,Confronting the Class Divide,8,16 June 2018,"This film came very highly recommended, if only from one of those countless number of Youtube sites that seem to deal exclusively with movies. Okay, it was listed as one of the must see movies, though ironically all of these must see movies were basically newer ones. Anyway, the film is based an a French comic book from the 70s and is actually touted as South Korea's most expensive film ever made (and it was directed by a South Korean). This does have the effect of setting it apart from much of the rubbish that seems to be filling our cinema screens these days.
 So, the story goes that the world is suffering the effects of Climate Change, and they decide to solve it by spraying stuff into the upper atmosphere. It worked, but the problem is that it worked a little too well - the entire world froze. Anyway, this excentric billionaire had build a railway line that circumnavigated the world, and was set up so people could live on it for years at a time, so pretty much everybody scrambled to get on board, though those who were not able to pay the hefty price tag were either denied entry or relegated to the tail section.
 The film begins in the tail section, which not surprising is overcrowded, and the people are basically poor and are fed things call protein bars. Every so often soldiers come in to hand out the food, but one day they come and take away all of the children, which pushes the people, who is led by Chris Evans (who plays Captain America, though not in this film) to stage a revolt. The whole idea is to get from one side of the train to the other and take control of the engine. The problem is that there happens to be a series of sealed doors between them and their goal, so they also need a technician to be able to break though.
 This film is clearly a comment on the class culture, but I think it goes much further than that. The way I see it it seems to be a microcosm of the world in which we live. If you happen to live in a poor country then good luck actually getting out of that country to get to a better country. In fact these days there seems to be a lot more borders being closed, and refuges relegated to detention camps in places that are even more inhospitable. 
 I guess the problem is that it is the case of the rich not wanting to share with the poor, and also this idea that the poor are in that situation through either their own fault, or some curse by some divine power. In a sense it seems to be an essence of entitlement, but in another sense many of us who are wealthy simply have no dialogue with the poor. We simply don't understand and don't want to understand. Actually this film goes even further to create this idea that the poor should actually be grateful that they get what they do from the rich. In a way it is a sickening concept, yet I can't claim to be all that innocent of it either. I guess it just happens to be that bubble that we to live in.
 Another thing that stands out in this film is its quirkiness. This is a trait of many French films, and it seems that the South Koreans have kept with it. I have seen other adaptations of French stories, such as Tintin, and they seem to shy away from it. Well, this isn't the case here - they embrace it with open arms. This is something that I find great about this film - the characters have their little quirks and oddities, particularly the ones from the front of the train. It seems that this is also a nature of the divide, where wealth and luxury actually breeds these quirks, whereas the poor are simply struggling to survive. However, in the end, the old addage still holds true - he who dies with the most toys, still dies.",Snowpiercer
52,Reno-Rangan,A journey to nowhere.,8,10 April 2014,"Recently, many Korean directors leaped onto Hollywood for movies like 'The Last Stand' and 'Stoker'. Actually, none of them were not bad, those were pretty good first steps to test their potential into the world's largest arena. For a change this movie was Korean but had 99% western actors in it and also was in English. Probably the first Korean English language movie as per my knowledge.An intense action-drama filled with some amount of mysteries to put viewer edge of the seat. Well written screenplay to form into an entertaining cinema. More like it was inspired by some computer game or games can inspire by this. The whole story takes place on a non-stop moving train which carries only survivors after failed experiments regarding global warming. Each portion of the train carries different class people to keep the human kind balanced. But the problem arises when one of the box people tries to break all the barriers.There were no flashbacks in the picture, but was narrated in a voice like a bedtime story. If you liked 'Dredd' or 'The Raid Redemption' you would like it as well because in those movies prime preferences were given to stunt sequences and suspense than the story and twist. That is why all these flick looks alike, but distinguished by their locations and character appearances.The first half was very good, but further moving toward the second half kind of fall short to keep the same momentum. It might be because they were not digging deep of what they're showing on the screen. Overall a pleasing story, but the end was ordinary, looked like same villain trick from various movies. After the great first half and average second, it is hard to put them together to say one hell of a movie because of the falling graph draft from starting point to the end.

55,tomgillespie2002,A hit-and-miss experience,5,29 December 2015,"Studio interference is certainly nothing new in the movie business, but it's sickening to think that, with all the disastrous films that have been the result of suits sticking their noses into an artists vision, an experienced and extremely successful studio head like Harvey Weinstein can demand edits on a finished product that had already tested well with audiences. And so, Snowpiercer limped onto the big screen in selected cinemas and performed well with the small audiences that were actually able to see it, and is still unreleased in many countries, including here in the UK.The English-language debut of genre director Joon Ho Bong, Snowpiercer mixes post-apocalyptic spectacle with social and political commentary with equally mixed success. Set on board of the eponymous, self-sufficient train that navigates the globe once every 365 days in a world thrown into a new ice age by our attempts to halt global warming, our scruffy hero Curtis (a steely-eyed Chris Evans) has spent the last 17 years cramped inside of the lower-class carriage. Fed nothing but 'protein bars', which consist of questionable ingredients, and occasionally having their young children taken from them by armed guards, Curtis, along with leader Gilliam (John Hurt), plan a revolt.The revolt will hopefully lead them to the front carriage, where the upper classes live in luxury and with plenty of space. Backed by his loyal second-in-command Edgar (Jamie Bell), Curtis plans to release security expert Namgoong (Kang-Ho Song) to aid his path through the many carriages, eventually gaining control of the engine held sacred to most. However, their progression is met with resistance by Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton), a Margaret Thatcher-type who demands social order with a small army of masked men with an assortment of nasty weapons, and who answers only to the train's creator, Wilford (Ed Harris).Snowpiercer is at its best when at its most ferocious. A carriage fight involving Mason's terrifying guards and Curtis's beaten-down group of peasants, played out mostly in darkness, is a moment of nightmarish horror. Evans, having done little of note since he became Captain America, gives it his all throughout, showing us the darker side of his persona now so synonymous with the clean-cut and morally righteous Steve Rogers. However, these injections of ferocity switch to outright comedy within the blink of an eye. Ho Bong has always been good at mood shifts - the swings from comedy to tragedy in his Memories of Murder (2003) is what made the film a masterpiece in my humble opinion - but Snowpiercer struggles to blend these moments together.Almost immediately after the bloody battle, Curtis finds himself in a classroom teaching 'train babies', where we learn the history of the train and how they are being taught to worship the 'sacred engine'. It is filmed with a Terry Gilliam-esque absurdity, all bizarre angles and close-ups of an over-the-top Alison Pill as the violence turns into slapstick, jarring with the brutality that came before. For the most part, this is grim stuff, and Ho Bong is keen to keep reminding you. Along with the heavy violence throughout, we also get a monologue about eating babies that is too ridiculous to be taken with a straight face. There are some interesting comments regarding the use of fear and chaos to control a populace at the end, but the film doesn't seem to know when and how to finish. A very hit-and-miss experience.",Snowpiercer
56,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing...,7,1 April 2021,"""Snowpiercer"" is a Drama - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch some people living on a train that travels around the world after an experiment that failed to change the climate from warming. People need to change some things on the train because they cannot handle it anymore.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot based on an amazing and clever idea. The direction which was made by Bong Joon Ho was exceptional and he did an amazing job. Regarding the interpretations of Chris Evans who played as Curtis, Octavia Spencer who played as Tanya and Kang-ho Song who played as Namgoong Minsoo, I believe that they also did an excellent job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were John Hurt's who played as Gilliam and Tilda Swinton's who played as Mason.

57,Floated2,Surprisingly well done Sci-fi Action Film,9,30 June 2014,"Snowpiercer is a sci-fi film which may get overlooked amongst mainstream film audiences, but the film delivers on all angles. Snowpiercer is more of a derivative dystopian sci-fi, though, Bong's approach to the genre helps it transcend its many influences. Eschewing the standard action beats of a Hollywood blockbuster, he takes his time setting up the characters and the train's claustrophobic environment, but pays this off with the relentless forward momentum of a plot that sees Captain America star Chris Evans lead a revolt of the train's tail-end inhabitants (among them Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer and Ewan Bremner) – one that requires them to fight their way to the front in order to seize control of the engine.The train's varying class-based compartments (one of which is a sushi restaurant in carriage-sized aquarium) allows Bong to unleash the full force of his imagination as well as providing him with unusual backdrops for staging action set pieces, which he does with typical élan (a literal firefight in a blacked-out carriage on New Year's Eve is the highlight).He also fills the movie with weird and wonderfully oddball characters, chief among them a ruthless, order-obsessed bureaucrat played by a Yorkshire-accented Tilda Swinton with the menace of Margaret Thatcher, the eye-wear of Deirdre Barlow and the dental work of Janet Street-Porter.In the end, Snowpiercer may lack some of the force of Bong's South Korean work, but it's recognisably of a piece with the likes of The Host and Mother and works an entertainingly off-kilter slice of pulpy mainstream filmmaking, executed with humor, verve and vision.",Snowpiercer
58,eddie_baggins,Could well be a new genre classic!,9,5 June 2014,"Mark my (un-professional and un-qualified) words cinema lovers, Snowpiercer is destined for a long and healthy life as not only a cult classic but a Sci-Fi genre classic and despite all its lengthy and well talked about post production troubles (that involve delayed releases in Western countries due to Harvey Weinstein thinking this may be too smart for Western audiences) Snowpiercer is a film that defies categorization or a comparable title and works in almost all areas that it should of failed in.Joon-ho Bong director and maker of the fantastic creature feature The Host has here with his first English language movie crafted a unique and often freakishly original adaptation of the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige, filling his tale with brimming to life characters, high energy action and a script that often goes to unexpected and intriguing places. Heightening these facets achieved is the fact that the entire movie takes place on a moving train, not exactly the typical place to tell a 2 hour plus tale of class structure and pin point examination of human nature. That Bong had the courage and skill to pull this off is testament to his talent behind the camera and it cannot be underestimated just how well he pulls off the telling of his material. Bong also has at his disposal a to die for and on form cast and a production crew that have pulled off some of the most impressive set design seen in sci-fi for some time.The people aboard humanity's last harbourer of life are filled with relatable characteristics, flaws and all including the train itself act as living breathing members of the film thanks to a wonderful portrayal of a class system aboard a moving locomotive. Each section is a wonderment of production and thought from a brainwashed children's classroom to a fully-fledged aquarium, one of the true joys of the film is seeing what awaits our revellers behind each unlocked door. This group of revellers lead by Captain America himself Chris Evans in much gruffer form as reluctant leader Curtis are a mightily interesting bunch. From Jamie Bell's loyal second hand man Edgar, John Hurt's limb missing wise man Gilliam and Tilda Swinton's barely recognisable Thatcher like matriarch Mason, the cast brims with colour and life and takes Snowpiercer to comparable levels to Sci-Fi classics like Alien/Aliens in terms of cast likability.With all its troubles involving Harvey ""Scissorhands"" Weinstein Snowpiercer truly deserves more acknowledgment and sadly that may take years down the line to come to fruition. Marketed the right way Snowpiercer could've easily been one of the year's sleeper hits and possibly even award winning features. Visually stunning and filled to the brim with ideas you get the feeling as many films in the past have proved, glory may take a while to achieve but once it arrives it's just as sweet as ever and ladies and gentleman you will one day be calling this a Sci-Fi masterpiece, a call that is absolutely deserved for one of the year's best films.4 and a half protein jelly blocks out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Snowpiercer
59,leonblackwood,An enjoyable ride! 6/10,6,7 September 2016,"Review: I quite enjoyed this movie, mainly because of its originality and intensity throughout, and the different characters made it interesting. I liked the Chinese couple, Kang-ho Song (Namgoong Minsoo) and Ah-sung Ko (Yona), who played a big part in there escape, and the other big names, like Chris Evans (Curtis), Jamie Bell (Edgar), Tilda Swinton (Mason), John Hurt (Gilliam) and Ed Harris (Wilford), all pulled together, to make this weird storyline, actually work. I didn't quite understand why they called it Snowpiercer, because the whole film is based on a train, and the only time that you really get to see snow is right at the very end. Anyway, the action scenes were pretty graphic but impressive, and the difference of each section of the train, was put together well but I didn't quite get the ending. I think the director left it up to the audience to make up there own conclusions but it would have been good to see if there was any other survivors. I still liked the pace of the film and Chris Evans was a great choice as the hero of the impossible situation. Tilda Swinton's played her role extremely well and those false teeth cracked me up but on the downside, it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again. Enjoyable!Round-Up: With such a great cast, and a decent storyline, Joon-ho Bong, 46, put together a decent movie which deserved to make a profit at the box office. His previous projects, have mostly been for an Oriental market, so this is his first movie for a worldwide market. I must admit, I didn't hear about this movie 3 years ago, so I don't think that it had a big distribution campaign but with Chris Evans starring in the Avengers and the Captain America movies, I'm sure that this film will eventually get a wider audience.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $87millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/dramas/thrillers, starring Chris Evans, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Ed Harris, Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer and Ewen Bremner. 6/10",Snowpiercer

62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Everything you expect and want from a dystopian sci-fi film, plus a little more",9,3 January 2015,"Every so many years, a fantastic dystopian science-fiction film comes around that barely anyone hears about, yet the few who see it spread the gospel and eventually it becomes a cult hit. ""Children of Men"" and ""Equilibrium"" are a couple that come to mind. This year's vastly underrated entry sure to develop a following is ""Snowpiercer"" from Korean director Joon Ho Bong (""The Host"").Based conceptually on the French graphic novel ""Le Transperceneige,"" the human survivors of a failed global warming experiment that left the world frozen over are all aboard the Snowpiercer, a train that perpetually circles the globe. The story is set 17 years into the train's journey. Curtis (Chris Evans), who has been on the train since he was 17, is ready to lead the passengers in the back cars, who live in horrid conditions, in revolt. Their plan is to traverse the entirety of the train to the front, where train creator, Mr. Wilford stays with his beloved engine keeping their society running and therefore keep ""everything in its place.""Revolution is a clichéd yet foundational component of dystopian stories, but containing it all on a train with this video game-like plot of heading from car to car is ingeniously entertaining. In many ways, Bong marries the rich, thematic style of American and English science-fiction with this level-by-level approach of foreign action movies. On one hand, you have John Hurt playing the grandfather of the revolution and spouting thematic wisdom to Curtis, and on the other you have a scene in which the lower class does battle with masked, axe-wielding train guards. (This fight sequence, by the way, is easily the year's most exciting and memorable.)This juxtaposition of Eastern and Western styles even trickles down to the characters. Instrumental to the rebels' success is a man in the prison car named Minsoo (Kang-ho Song), a junkie who knows how to open all the gates to all the cars, whose daughter Yona (Ah-sung Ko) has a sort of clairvoyance and knows what awaits behind each door. So you have these Western heroes in Evans and Jamie Bell, who partner with these characters who are both played by Koreans and are typical of characters in Korean action movies, and they rely on each other to make the story move forward.The wild card of all these characters is Tilda Swinton's Mason, the front of the train's voice to the back of the train. Her character goes from epitomizing the evil of this dystopian autocracy to something else entirely; she's like an even quirkier version of Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket in ""The Hunger Games"" series. Other casting choices including Oscar winner Octavia Spencer as a woman in the back whose son is taken from her at the onset of the film and Alison Pill in a cameo as a propaganda-spouting teacher show just how diverse and entertaining the movie is.The division of classes gives Bong a lot to work with artistically. The beginning of the film is full of grays and browns with the occasional bright color when someone from the front of the train comes to the back. As they make their way forward and discover train cars that include an aquarium, a garden and a classroom, Bong opens the color palette up to drive home the class discrepancy that fuels the story from an emotional standpoint.Like any good Dystopian film, Bong and co-writer Kelly Masterson (""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"") have loaded the movie with all the great hallmarks of the genre including tons of ideas about humanity. Other than the train, however, there's no one aspect of the movie that wasn't inspired by something else or could be considered similar to another film or novel. Yet the train acts as fresh packaging in so many ways, enhancing the presentation as to make everything feel exciting and new, even though it borrows from several time-tested tropes.Thrilling, entertaining and thought-provoking from caboose to engine, ""Snowpiercer"" caters to all your expectations of the genre and feeds them through a streamlined plot that, like the titular train and its precious engine, never stops moving. Excitement and anticipation strike at the opening of each and every gate as to what lies behind it, especially the last one, where we know Wilford himself and the answers to all our questions await, including the classic notion of ""what will our hero do once he knows the truth?"" And the best part may be that once you've seen ""Snowpiercer,"" you get to recommend it to all your friends.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more!",Snowpiercer

65,southdavid,Tracks Of My Tears.,7,5 August 2020,"Having recently finished the first season of the TV version, it seemed like a good time to go and take a look at Bong Joon Ho's original adaptation of the French Graphic Novel.Following a failed attempt to avert global warming, the planet has frozen and the only life remains is on board Snowpiercer, a large train that circumnavigates the globe with a delicate onboard ecosystem. The humans on board live to a strict class structure, with those in the tail living in squalor. However, an uprising is planned, with Curtis (Chris Evans) acting as its leader.I feel like the concept of ""Snowpiercer"" works better in a two hour movie than it does in a continuing series. I was less questioning of how the world works here, than I was with the series, which is fortunate as it perhaps does a worse job of being convincing, but both versions require quite a large suspension of disbelieve to get you started. Like his later film ""Parasite"", Bong Joon Ho is again showing us the real world through a microcosm, and how the class structures, and the desire to keep people in their class structures, works. But this film is more dynamic that his Oscar winner - with a clearer narrative thrust, as Curtis attempts to get to the front of the train to face off with Mr Wilford (Ed Harris).There are some excellent performances, with Tilda Swinton adopting a broad Lancastrian accent for a memorable turn, and with Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Ewen Bremner, Alison Pill and John Hurt all showing up for admirable support. It's wonderfully shot and edited and the effects and violence are well done.But If I'm honest, I admired rather than loved it. The whole metaphor is a little heavy handed, some of the fights were a little repetitive and the ending was a bit of an anti-climax. It's not bad, by any means, but I can't see me watching it again any time soon.",Snowpiercer
66,Vartiainen,Dark social science fiction,8,2 October 2014,"Snowpiercer was a surprise to me. I thought it would be just another ""social commentary"" dystopian film trying to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games craze. Instead what I ended up getting was one of the best post-apocalyptic films I've ever seen. A smooth roller coaster of action and quiet, dark dialogue.And don't get me wrong, it is another ""social commentary"" dystopian film, and yes, perhaps it's riding The Hunger Games craze just a little bit. But, when that riding ends up producing a film of this quality, is it a bad thing? And it's not like The Hunger Games invented the idea of alternative future where the poor are trying to usurp the rich people that are controlling them from their towers of ivory. These are both just variations of Orwell's 1984, which draws heavily from the age old tale of the underdog, David versus Goliath.It's the execution of an idea that makes or breaks a film and here that execution is nigh flawless. Everything from the design of the train to the A-list cast of actors to the storyline that keeps up the relentless pace, but still has time to reflect on the motives, histories and moods of the characters.Snowpiercer is simplistic art. It doesn't try to win you over with limitless of details, high explosives or flashiness. Rather it takes a central idea and fills it with as much quality as possible.

As for Snowpiercer, the new looks from ""outside"" (Korean director Bong Joon-ho) has enabled to find new angles and approaches, or to use methodology uncommon in US movies (e.g. that ""good guys"" performed by famous actors may loose their lives as well and far before the ending). Nevertheless, some scenes provide no additional value to the movie, the others have too evident similarities with Wes Andersen's movies, and some motives and background raise questions without no answers in the run (e.g., Why were all those coaches really necessary? Where/how did the people relieve themselves? How could the food insects reproduce?). The ending could have been more conclusive as well.With respect to performances, particularly Tilda Swinton, Go Ah-sung, Tómas Lemarquis and Ed Harris give more versatile performances than the stars Chris Evans and Song Kang-ho. In my opinion, this movie could have used more famous and distinct persons in leading roles as well, alike we see in Tarantino's movies. Specifically, their participation in deep reasoning is somewhat implausible.Nevertheless, a good movie, especially if you focus less on probabilities-improbabilities, and follow the progression of events caused by diverse rail-car interiors.",Snowpiercer

The train is a linear metaphor for society, with the desperate, starving poor at the back, living in darkness and in fear of the train's heavily armed security people while in the front a decadent bourgeois enjoy the sun, eat sushi and cavort in fetishistic night clubs. At the very front, of course, is the engine, from which all things flow and the train's designer, the now deified Wilford (Ed Harris). The story follows a rebellion led by Curtis (Chris Evens), who becomes the first adult to travel from the omega to the alpha, from the last, most desperate car, to the first, the sacred engine itself. The story, based on the graphic novel 'Le Transperceneige' by Jean-Marc Rochette is excellent (in a fanciful, surrealistic way), as is the cast (especially Tilda Swinton's grotesque bureaucrat Minister Mason), Bong Joon-ho's direction, and the imagery of life on the train and of the frozen world through which it passes.

70,dfranzen70,"Good, but not awesome as it wants to be",8,28 July 2014,"Snowpiercer is about a train that circles the globe in a post-apocalyptic Earth in an infinite loop, carrying the last survivors of the human race. It's a long, long train, stocked with all the comforts of life, but there's much more than meets the eye. Well, if you're looking at the train from the outside, anyway. Inside, a terrifying class system has erupted. The movie is classic visceral action, bloody and unbowed, brimming with excellent fight scenes and not-so-quiet desperation.The human race is basically extinct because of an ill-fated idea (some 17 years before the events depicted in the film) to combat the effects of global warming by dispersing a special gas in the upper atmosphere. Rather than solve the planet's environmental woes, the gas froze Earth, killing off all life – except those in the train, of course. Now the self-sustaining locomotive chugs onward past a bitterly cold landscape.The train is run by Wilford (Ed Harris), a man who apparently had the foresight to built a metric ton of track all over the world. Many people paid a pretty penny to be passengers, and when the frost finally hit, many others were able to glom on for survival. Trouble is, those poor souls are kept in the rear car of the train, subsisting on gelatinous protein bars, in utter squalor. One of these souls is Curtis (Chris Evans), who carefully plans a coup against Wilford's minions, who include Tilda Swinton as Mason, a liaison between the haves and the have-nots. Curtis's best pal is Edgar (Jamie Bell), a punch-first Irishman with a lotta spunk to go with his brogue; others include the ancient Gilliam (John Hurt), who's missing an arm and a leg, and Tanya (Octavia Spencer), mother to a precocious five year old.Curtis's plan is simple. Overpower the guards (the tail-section people outnumber them) and then use the skills of Namgoong Minsoo (Kang-ho Song) to open each subsequent door, or gate. Each car in the train serves a different purpose – water supply, food supply, and so on. It's a long journey, longer than you'd think walking the length of a train would be. And they better not mess up, either, lest a Wilford minion stick their arms out of windows into the frozen air – the easier to chop them off, you see. (That's why so many are missing limbs.) Where Snowpiercer excels is in its personalization of Curtis's situation. We're not in his head, but we can understand why he's so driven, why he so desperately wants to get his fellow downtrodden to a better place, one where the food and water is plentiful. For the viewer, the excitement builds with each car – what's behind door #4? Bad guys with machetes? Or maybe a nice garden? I liked Snowpiercer because of Evans' unflinching performance. He's practically the opposite of Captain America here, so he's fairly unrecognizable. His Curtis seems surprisingly strong for a guy who's been eating Jell-O bars for 17 years, but still. The action is fast and furious, and the body count is high. You might well wonder, too, why the train has to perpetually be in motion. I don't recall it bluntly stated in the film, but I guess the same mechanism that propels the train also sustains the life inside (i.e., clean air, electricity). So there's that.At times, the action is so frenetic that it's tough to tell who's smacking whom, whether it's bad guy versus good guy or just discerning between two good guys. In low lighting, a lot of these fellas look the same.What does it all mean? Perhaps the ending is a little too concrete or literal. You have all of these people on a huge, lumbering train that's going nowhere as fast as possible, and the denouement may leave viewers a little empty, as if some existential point should have been made. But whatever the conclusion, the journey is an exciting blast of adrenaline.Snowpiercer: ***",Snowpiercer
71,stevendbeard,Post Apocalyptic Train Ride,7,6 July 2014,"I saw ""Snowpiercer"", starring Chris Evans-the Captain America movies, the Fantastic Four movies; Ed Harris-Man on a Ledge, The Rock; Tilda Swinton-Moonrise Kingdom, Vanilla Sky and John Hurt-the Hellboy movies, Spaceballs.This is a post apocalyptic story about people living on a never ending train ride that is circling the world at fantastic speeds. It's directed by a South Korean named Bong Joon-ho-Mother,The Host-in his first English movie and it is based on a French graphic novel. The story takes place in 2031, 17 years after the disastrous attempt to stop global warming turned the entire world into an ice covered planet. Ed loved trains and before the disaster, he built a thousand car train with a perpetual motor in it that would circle the entire world; kind of like a Noah's Ark. The only survivors in the world are the people that got on his train. The train is divided into different classes, with the poor at the back and the rich in the front. In between the two groups are food cars, clubs, schools, beauty salons and even an aquarium for fresh fish. Chris plays one of the poor class that decides, along with his buddies, that they should take over the train and get some decent food-they have been living off protean bars that are rationed to them by the rich class and you do not want to know what they are made of. John is the leader of the poor class but is getting too old to do any fighting and tells Chris to take over as leader. Tilda plays the spokesperson for Ed, in an unrecognizable role-she wears big round glasses and a set of over-sized false teeth. She passes along all the orders, since Ed never leaves his cushy front engine car. Chris and his followers have to fight their way through all the other cars to try and reach the front and Ed doesn't make it very easy on them; he has lots of storm trooper looking thugs, with guns, to throw in their path. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and drug content and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes. I enjoyed it, except for the ending. I would probably buy it on DVD.",Snowpiercer

These are the foremost bits of advice that Tilda Swinton and Chris Evans' characters, respectively, have to offer SNOWPIERCER viewers in the event of an environmental disaster and controlled anarchy (think THE PURGE, 24/365). SNOWPIERCER is the sort of tale that starts out promising at the end, but peters out as it moves toward the front story. (If that sounds confused, just wait till you see this movie.) Though not the same genre as the Ben Kingsley vehicle TRANSSIBERIAN, these train-based features are very similar (it's been too long since I've viewed SILVER STREAK to bring that into the conversation). Both films feature lots of snow and violent shenanigans. But TRANSSIBERIAN comes to a logical climax, whereas SNOWPIERCER just gets more and more nonsensical. This yarn seems more suited to be a graphic novel than a movie requiring its actors to say such lines as those quoted in my summary with a straight face.

73,drqshadow-reviews,"Dark, Weird, Ambitious and Wildly Entertaining - Try Not to Focus on the Plot Holes",8,20 January 2015,"Seventeen years after the fall of civilization and the onset of a man-made ice age, the last remnants of the human race struggle to coexist aboard a very long, class-segregated passenger train. It's a real love-it-or-hate-it dose of science fiction crazy. If you can look past the miles of odd, glaring holes spattering the plot and appreciate the sheer, raw, carefree conceptual strength, it's easy to embrace. On the other hand, if you're the type that can't stop picking at loose threads, the whole fabric is bound to fall apart. I usually find myself somewhere in between those two extremes, but during Snowpiercer I was able to silence the critic in the back of my head long enough to enjoy the ride. And it's quite the experience, brimming with blunt (yet, strangely charming) metaphors and social commentaries, abrupt, brutal doses of gang warfare and all manner of high-concept weirdness. It's an especially well-realized nightmare, too, with a rapidly-shifting visual style, effective matching changes in the cinematography and constant, subtle background reminders of the strange setting. The plot does have its struggles, most of which probably could have been tidied by an attentive editor, but at the end of the day that kind of reckless disregard for the rules serves to make it even more unpredictable and fascinating. Very dark, especially in the mindbending third act, it's as fresh a spectacle as I've seen in quite a while.",Snowpiercer
74,alindsay-al,A Great really Unique Film,8,27 July 2020,"So after watching the first season of the show Snowpiercer, I have decided to go back and watch the film called the main title. This film is based on a book and was bought to the cinema screen in 2013 and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees after the world is destroyed a group of human survivors are living on a train where different ends of the train clash.Main Character
Chris Evans plays the main character here and he is really good, it is funny how at this point I find it strange to see him and not think of Captain America but he does that well. He is seen as this leader of the worse off population and you just see how it affects him and puts the stress on him as he goes on. His character has plenty of depth and by the end of the film you see this character in a different light which is a true testimony to the great script and Evans great performance.Supporting Cast
Jamie Bell is an actor who has gained decent recognition but I have to be honest I have never been that impressed but I thought he was good here. His chemistry with Evans is well done and I liked how his character has some energy here and really adds some life to this film. Tilda Swinton has a role here as one of the upper class and she was truly fantastic here, she was so good I had to check online that it was her as she transformed herself. She has quite a bit of dark humour here and I thought it played off the other characters very well. Kang-Ho Sung who was in Parasite and Ko Asung play interesting parts in the film and I don't want to go into too much detail as there are some surprises but they both do a really good job and are some of the more interesting characters here. The late John Hurt, Octavia Spencer, Ed Harris & Ewan Bremner also do good jobs in their roles here.Story
The story is really interesting, really we are alongside the people in the back at the train called the tail and we see the train with them. It feels like we are on a journey with these people as we see different parts of the train at the same time as they do. The characters are really well written and it makes them feel more complex and not one dimensional characters. But I thought there was maybe even more they could have done with the story, there are parts of the train they go though that maybe I thought they could have explored a bit longer and in more depth.Script
The script here is expertly written, there is a great amount of drama that is both horrifying and tense throughout. Also there is a nice injection of dark humour in there, mainly from Swinton's character which is why she feels like an important cog in this film.Style
Bong Joon Ho the director of the amazing Parasite is the director here and he gives a great visual experience here. It shows the different levels of the train brilliantly and I got a better idea of the class system then the show by just following these people which is really well done. But also I thought the action scenes aren't truly great, there is plenty of shaky cam here and over use of slow mo and it does hold it back a bit.Overall
Overall, this is a great unique experience, it is chilling and claustrophobic and feels like a great film. This is a great experience and a film that is a great film to watch and I would advise watching Snowpiercer for sure.",Snowpiercer
75,CubsandCulture,"The Sci-Fi, Horizontal version of Parasite",9,1 March 2020,"In light of enjoying Parasite as much as I did I started to work my way through Bong Joon Ho's films. This film reminds me strongly of Parasite despite being such a different set-up. It too has a biting critique of modern capitalism that never gets in the way of the engaging thriller story. It too has a distinctive style-it is amazing just how much this film move left right without it feeling forced. It too contains a lot of great acting and characters. Evans and Swinton especially give really engaging performances. I might be swayed that Evans is the best he has been in this film.The story suffers a little bit at the edges. The ecology, and technology, of the train isn't entirely believable. Even watching the film a couple of times now I am bit confused about some of the plotting elements. The film struggles to tell the current story of the revolution and the story of the train as a piece of futurism. Likewise, the film's tone isn't fully consistent. A few times-the classroom section especially-it veered into to overt satire for the darker tone that surrounds it.Nonetheless, this is a really good film made by a director with a distinctive. voice.",Snowpiercer
76,estebangonzalez10,Now that is how you make the transition from a Korean to an English language film without losing your personal stamp and style,8,15 April 2014,"¨Know your place. Accept your place. Be a shoe.¨I was pleasantly surprised at how well Korean director, Joon-ho Bong, made the transition to this his first English language film because the style and tone of the film still felt entirely Korean despite starring some well known Hollywood actors. I enjoyed this film so much that I ended up watching it twice and that is something I rarely do. Based on the French graphic novel, Le Transperceneige written by Jean-Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer is an ambitious dystopian sci-fi film that despite having a very absurd premise works really well thanks to Bong's direction. It has some great performances with memorable characters, several exciting action scenes mixed with bizarre comedic moments, and a thought provoking metaphor on classicism. It is a bleak film but Bong handled the material so well that it kept me engaged and interested. Unfortunately the film does suffer from a rather unconvincing final act, but for most of its running time I was so entertained that I wasn't too disappointed.Snowpiercer takes place in 2031 after a failed global-warming experiment has frozen all of Earth and wiped out all life. The only survivors are the passengers of a super train traveling across the globe with a perpetual-motion engine. Designed by Wilford, an engineer who knew the experiment would fail, the train has been running for 17 straight years and a social class system has developed as the passengers of the rear end live in extremely poor conditions. Here we are introduced to a young man named Curtis (Chris Evans) who is trying to come up with a plan to get past all the security guards in order to reach the front section where Wilford is presumed to be. He isn't alone on this quest as most of the passengers are upset for the abuse they've suffered and the extreme poor conditions in which they are forced to live in. A wise old man named Gilliam (John Hurt) who helped Wilford design the engine, has been helping Curtis rally the men together. Curtis's good friend, Edgar (Jamie Bell), is also awaiting the moment to begin their revolution as things begin to get worse once the guards take a few kids away from them. Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Andrew (Ewen Bremner) are among the victims whose children have been taken away from them so they are also eager to attack. The first step of the plan involves freeing Namgoong (Song Kang-ho), a prisoner who has a special gift for unlocking the doors to each section, but the task won't be easy as the guards will do what it takes to make sure they stay at the rear section of the train.Bong has directed several successful Korean films like The Host and Memories of a Murder, and in his first English language film his style remains untouched. Despite having some scenes that borderline in the ridiculous he somehow manages to balance those moments really well. For example there is this huge action scene that he has set up between the rebels and the guards who are awaiting them with axes. The bloody and violent confrontation begins, only to be interrupted as the train is approaching a bridge which serves as a landmark for the New Year. The fighting stops for a few seconds as everyone begins the countdown and admires the view of the outside world from inside the train, then the violence and mayhem continue. There are several moments like this where Bong perfectly balances these gorgeously crafted choreographed scenes with moments of quirky comedy and twisted sense of humor. The best example of this type of humor comes from the two characters played by Tilda Swinton (who is unrecognizable in this film) and Alison Pill who are terrific and steal the few scenes they are in. I really loved that classroom scene that felt completely out of place with the dark tail section of the train. I think it was those goofy moments that I enjoyed the most in this film. It was a great sensory experience to get to follow these characters through each section of the train and I have to give Bong credit for his visionary style because as our heroes progress to the front of the train things begin to get more and more bizarre and you never know what to expect. The film is short of being a masterpiece because the final 30 minutes are disappointing, but as a social satire Snowpiercer worked better than other recent sci-fi films like Elysium. It is a very weird and strange film, but it is really good and I enjoyed it even more on my second viewing.",Snowpiercer
77,Fluke_Skywalker,Derailed by ham-fisted approach,5,8 November 2014,"Bong Joon-Ho's 'Snowpiercer' takes a tired and stale pile of left-wing moralizing and wraps it up in a somewhat intriguing premise. Unfortunately it all quickly falls apart thanks to its threadbare logic and clumsy storytelling. The talented cast do what they can with material that isn't anywhere near what it aspires to be, but they can't add depth that isn't there.'Snowpiercer' does reward you for your patience at times, but good moments do not a good movie make. With a little more thought, this might have been an effective allegory instead of the turgid and clumsy wannabe that it ultimately is.",Snowpiercer
78,sauravjoshi85,An interesting Film with different approach,8,31 July 2021,"Snowpiercer is a science fiction action film directed by Bong Joon-ho and stars Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Go Ah-sung, Late John Hurt, and Ed Harris.Bong Joon-ho has a different approach when it comes to firm making and this is another example of an interesting movie with a different point of view.The movie is based on the story of second ice age and the survivors forced to live on a train. Although the train is a luxury train but still has the differentiation between Elite class who has all the luxuries and poor class who are forced to live on overcrowded coaches surviving on protein bars.The acting is great and Chris Evans had done his job with pure perfection, he had adapted his character superbly. Song Kang-ho features regularly in Bong Joon-ho movies and is been good, Tilda Swinton had was impressive in her negative role. Ed Harris and Octavia Spencer could've been utilized much better although they were also impressive.Screenplay of the movie is evenly paced and will keep the interest in the movie intact, VFX is also the strong point of the movie. Climax of the movie is unique and had a superb but different ending. If you are a fan of Bong Joon-ho or Chris Evans then this is the movie for you. A must watch.",Snowpiercer
79,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Unnerving social commentary fused with rousing adventure,9,9 December 2016,"Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer is a cold affair in more ways than one. It treats it's characters with the same icy indifference as the storm which batters the few remaining people on the planet, confined to a locomotive that speeds around the globe in perpetual motion, humanity's last ditch effort against a cataclysmic ice age of their own making. The train is designed to house the poor and disenfranchised folks in filthy barracks at the back end of the back, while the rich and privileged elite live in glamorous excess at the front. What better metaphor for brutal classism? A confined vehicle from which their is no escape, dwindling resources and rising tensions eerily serve to remind us of our own situation on this rock. Chris Evans grimes up his Captain America image as the ruthless leader of the poor, rebelling traincar by traincar and waging an ongoing war against the upper class and their minions, his sights set on reaching the engine. Unfortunately they're up against some nasty security forces dispatched to end their rebellion at any cost, including axe wielding henchman, a J.T. Walsh lookalike who is tougher to kill than a terminator and an absolutely nutballs Tilda Swinton, unrecognizable under a dairy queen cake of makeup and a muddled northern England accent, dryly playing the tyrannical head of propaganda. Aside from the obvious social satire that hits home, the film is also a rollicking action slam dunk with some jaw dropping, delightfully implausible set pieces and truly inspired visual design. Each train car has a different theme and purpouse, from a self sufficient aquarium (anybody want some sushi?) to a terrifyingly cheerful classroom where kiddies are brainwashed by a crackhead of a school teacher (Alison Pill in overdrive), and eventually the engine itself, a technological marvel presided over by a lonely, twisted and miscast Ed Harris as the architect of the whole deal, a role better suited for a Patrick Stewart or a Malcolm McDowell type. John Hurt plays the other half of the brains, stuck in squalor at the caboose, and there's work from Ewan Bremmer, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, Ah Sung Ko and Kang Ho Song as a resourceful explosives expert with his own agenda. The themes of this film will be difficult for some to swallow, which is what I imagine led to it's pish poor marketing, at least in North America. The topical, callous and icy blunt truths about society, sacrifice and oppression won't be willingly received by many, least of all the powers that be, who don't want such notions floating around freely. That's what makes it important though, and sets it a step above most. It reaches near taboo levels of thought, displaying ugliness and outrage that seems scarily logical the more you think about it. Plus it's a humdinger of an action adventure flick. Strong stuff, both in visual and narrative departments.",Snowpiercer
80,kluseba,Entirely entertaining despite a weak story and several plot holes,7,10 August 2014,"""Snowpiercer"" is quite a mixed bag. On the positive side, it features stunning decorations, graphics and locations as well as great fighting scenes and special effects and finally a gripping dark atmosphere from the beginning to the end. The different sections in the train, the winter landscapes and the different kinds of battles with bare hands and feet, knives and swords or guns keep the pace of this movie elevated. On the negative side, the story itself is quite simplistic and copied from many other dystopian movies and literature but what truly bothers me are several obvious plot holes. There is a minimal twist towards the end of the movie but after all the final moments of this film are rather disappointing.Some parts of the movie have an interesting potential such as the different characters. The actors play very well but some things about their characters are left unexplained. That's why many of them remain somewhat superficial as if they were made up by naive teenagers. While the different characters are intriguing on their own, they fail to develop a more profound chemistry between each other. Chris Evans and Song Kang-Ho are both great actors but they don't fit together as a team of leading characters. It's a little bit the same mismatch between the inhuman killer portrayed by Vlad Ivanov and the mysterious teenager played by Go Ah-Sung. I guess that a better script and an additional thirty minutes of running time to work on some character development would have rated this movie up.In the end, I was very well entertained by this movie from the beginning to the end despite its notable flaws. The art direction, the brilliant main director and the overall dystopian atmosphere are the movie's strongest points. If you care for dystopian movies filled with action and tension, I can recommend this film to you. If you are looking for something more profound and innovating, you have to look elsewhere.",Snowpiercer

The few survivors exist on board a mega-train, Snowpiercer, which runs on a globe-spanning track. The lower class passengers are in the tail, the middle in economy and the elite are at the front. Really all rather allegorical. The train's dictator is Wilford (Ed Harris), Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) is his propaganda aide and hatchet woman (literally). Curtis (Chris Evans) is plotting a revolt, Edgar (Jamie Bell) is his sidekick while Gilliam (John Hurt) is the intellectual inspiration for the rebels.An opportunity for an uprising occurs when children from the tail are seized by Wilford's security guards led by . This is suppressed by Mason (Swinton channelling a petty bureaucrat in a Yorkshire accent). Messages are passed back to Curtis by an unknown helper from the front of the train and eventually a revolt succeeds and the rebels fight their way through the train. Some incredible close quarter battle scenes involving hand-axes. Much of the action takes place in the narrow dark confines of the train. As they move forward though they encounter bright greenhouses and aquariums and a bizarre teacher (Alison Pill) in a classroom which carries on as if in the old days. At times the film gets as bizarre as any of Terry Gilliam's as it delivers it's message through satire and even slapstick humour. But many dark secrets are exposed on all sides during the quest through the train.Director/co-writer Bong Joon-ho has created a closed environment SF battle film, depending on irony and humour to get many of his points across. Similar in some respects to The Hunger Games but far more convincing. 8.5/10. On Netflix.",Snowpiercer

I did not even any plan to watch it myself when I saw that it was about a train running in the snow. The nebulous title also did not help. It did not really appeal to me. However, as the the week was winding up, I was reading more and more positive reviews about this. On this the last day, I made sure I went to see it. And am I glad I did.""Snowpiercer"" is set in 2031, 17 years after all life on earth was decimated by a chemical supposedly for global warming, but went overboard and buried the whole planet in snow instead. The only people left alive are on board a special train run by Wilford Industries, that had been perpetually going around its own tracks that spans all the continents all those years. We are first introduced to the poor people (in full dystopian look) in what was revealed to be the back of the train. They were fed protein bricks and made to suffer indignities as their guards and superiors desired. Led by the intrepid Curtis and their ""patriarch"" Gilliam, the poor one day stage a daring mutiny to reverse their fortunes. Will their plan prosper? Will they ever reach the very front of the train where Mr. Wilford himself personally runs the sacred locomotive engine?Chris Evans is completely in his element playing a heroic leader type character. He is no Captain America here, mind you. Tilda Swinton steals her scenes as a cartoonishly evil and underhanded Minister who makes it hard for the poor folk. Ed Harris plays the revered and wonderful technological wizard, Mr. Wilford. Playing smaller but notable parts were John Hurt, Jamie Bell and Octavia Spencer. There are also a lot of South Korean actors here, headed by Song Kang-ho (who seemed to have lost a lot of weight since I last saw him in ""The Host"" and ""Memories of Murder"") and Ko Ah-sung (who made her film debut in ""The Host""). The presence of an international cast makes the deep societal message that this film carries all the more substantial. This is biblical ""Noah's Ark"" meets Orwellian ""1984"".It is amazing to see that despite the big name Hollywood stars that headline it, this is actually a South Korean production, and directed by an acclaimed Korean director and writer Bong Joon-ho. I have already seen three of Bong's oeuvre before -- ""The Host"" (2006), ""Memories of Murder"" (2003) and even his full length directorial debut ""Barking Dogs Never Bite"" (2000)-- and I am a fan. How could I have overlooked that ""Snowpiercer"" was by him as well? I would not have waited this long to watch it.",Snowpiercer

The more we learn about what is going on and who actually does what, the less I cared. I didn't think the ending rewarded me for my time. I am not usually a fan of dystopian settings, so I am biased, but if had enjoyed the story, that wouldn't have mattered. Chris Evans shows that he is a believable leader even when he isn't wearing a super suit. Tilda Swinton disappears into one of her stranger roles. And the kindergarten teacher, who might have been the most interesting character, nicely leaps from indoctrinating the youth to pure malice. That's all that good parts. I didn't quite understand what John Hurt's character had to do with the grand scheme, and I'm not a fan of the ""everyone dies"" trope, nor do I really get into the ""last survivors of humanity"" thing.

This is based off a French graphic novel and is about a post apocalyptic scenario where an experiment to stop global warming has gone terribly wrong leaving the Earth in a new ice age where the remnants of humanity survive on this high tech train that travels around the world continuously smashing through ice. Director Bong Joon ho made an impressive film that is both visually and intellectually stimulating as Chris Evans leads a revolt from the downtrodden rear of the train to fight to the front. The film has a lot to say about class and is great allegorical social commentary under the guise of an action packed film. Speaking of which, the action scenes are excellent and the film is very sharp looking as well. This US/Korean/British co production is highly original, super high quality and very imaginative and creative film that is very thought provoking, but action packed entertainment that is highly recommended to those that can appreciate a well done film. The cast is great and an international melting pot that works with some highlight performances from Ed Harris and John Hurt and Captain America himself Chris Evans did an excellent job as the lead. Pay no mind to the negative comments on some of the user reviews on here, this is a truly outstanding film and an instant classic and the people bashing the film?

86,peterp-450-298716,A pleasant surprise.,7,2 April 2014,"This film was a pleasant surprise for once. Not because of the action but because of the deeper meaning. The train is actually a metaphor of the present world in which we live. A life that goes forward in a swift tempo for many. The train is actually a reflection of a micro-economy with a precisely measured division in different classes. The poor dangling at the bottom of society are in the final wagon in appalling conditions. The wealthier take their place in front surrounded by opulence and luxury. In between is the middle class who can't afford the excesses as the upper class, but are still considerably better off than the lower class.The entire film is set on the high-tech express train ""Snowpiercer"" designed by a Mr. Wilford. The train is ingenious. It contains an ecosystem to fabricate water from the broken ice where the train drills through and it's actually a perpetual motion machine that moves on a global railway tens of thousands of kilometers long. This is because brilliant scientists came up with the bright idea to spray a substance in the atmosphere to get the global warming back to normal. This was a complete failure and turned the Earth into a huge popsicle and life became impossible here. Several thousands of people were lucky to get on board of this eternal moving train and wait patiently until life on earth would be possible again. Stopping the train is out of the question and who dares to go outside (My first question that came up was, ""How ?"" ) turns instantly into an stalactite (or stalagmite! Depends on how you end up outside) There is a strict and repressive dictatorial regime to ensure that this society stays in balance. There is an underhand co-operation between the front and rear of the train. In this way milestones are staged to keep the growth of the population under control and the less fortunate retain a glimmer of hope to unyoke themselves.The only contact those poor souls have with the other part is when there is a food distributions composed of block-shaped jelly-like substances. Riots are immediately nipped in the bud and are usually followed with a flaming speech by Mason (played by Tilda Swinton beautifully) who has a sickly adoration and idolization for Wilford. She is a kind of ""Effie Trinket"" from ""The Hunger Games"", only uglier. The final message is that they should be eternally grateful and are privileged to be on board. "" Know your position, keep your position, be the shoe ."" That's the ultimate message. The shoe is used as a metaphor to indicate that they belong at the bottom of the hierarchy and have to stay there.This post-apocalyptic SF was extremely entertaining up to the time they reach the water treatment plant. Till then it was a very gloomy picture. A picture we have repeatedly witnessed in our history. From slavery in the southern states of America to Mao Tse-tung. A story of oppression and slavery. The images of ragged people queuing for their proteins and living without daylight in the last wagons. The build up to the revolution and the ultimate breakthrough are successfully displayed. The revolution is led by Curtis, a leader in the making who has a rather dubious past on this train and leads his troops forward on the way to the engine. For who owns the locomotive, is God ! Along the way they release Namgoong Minsu and his daughter Yona. This prisoner who is addicted to ""Kronol"" seems to be a security specialist and should be able to open all electronically sealed doors. The moment the door opens to a next wagon and they are facing an army of SM-masters equipped with axes, is impressive. Even more impressive as the battle that follows. I 'm pretty sure that Tarantino spontaneously starts to drool when he sees this scene.What follows is a hallucinatory impression. Compared with this the tour of Willy Wonka in his own factory means absolutely nothing. Successively we see a greenhouse where fresh tomatoes are grown ,an aquarium where manta rays swim around, a restaurant that serves sushi twice a year and a colorful classroom where a Maria von Trapp gives history lesson about the kingdom of Wilford. It looks sometimes like a Lynch movie where the screenwriter himself sniffed too much of ""Kronol"". There were also times that I had a ""Uh what !"" reaction. Like when they were shooting with a futuristic looking gun at each other while the train made ​​a seemingly endless huge curve. And the reason why the partying and ""Kronol"" sniffing in fur coats dressed mass became a bunch of bloodthirsty zombies, was also a mystery to me. I also found it strange that the passengers couldn't remember anything from their childhood or life on earth. And it ended with a shrewd reference to child labor.The most positive supporting actor was John Hurt as the counselor of Curtis. Most negative contribution was Ed Harris in a Chinese robe. Totally unbelievable.Conclusion: a sometimes confusing movie with a deep social critical message.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Snowpiercer
87,aidanratesmovies,"A Peculiar, but Fascinating Adventure",9,6 April 2020,"With brilliant direction as always from Bon Joon-Ho and a fantastic performance from Chris Evans, Snowpiercer is a spectacularly well made piece of work, even if it isn't exactly what you were expecting. The films greatest flaw is its dull nature at times, making certain scenes, although appropriately so, seem rather gloomy and a bit of a bore to watch. However, Snowpiercer is mainly able to counter these flaws by its peculiar and yet extremely interesting set of nature, a fantastic screenplay, and even better performances. Besides a very great performance from Evans as the lead, Kang-Ho Song, Octavia Spencer, and Tilda Swinton also give some great performances as supporting characters, as well as Go Ah-Sung. The film is impressively made, with some truly wonderful world building and a truly fascinating storyline. In the end, Snowpiercer may not be as good as some of Joon-Ho's best works, but it is more than enough of a satisfying tale that will truly transcend the test of time, and like the works of Blade Runner, may just earn its way to being a future sci-fi classic.

89,I_Ailurophile,"Startling, riveting - perfect",10,5 June 2021,"From the very moment the movie begins, it's impossible to tear our eyes away. 'Snowpiercer,' with its gripping themes, captivating narrative, and entrancing visuals, once again proves that Bong Joon-ho, as both screenwriter and director, is a nearly unrivaled filmmaker.Even just the opening credits showcase Bong's impossibly alluring style: Against the black of limitless night, sparse snowflakes fly through the air as garbled media broadcasts offer background for the story. Title cards follow with scenes of apocalypse to present the last necessary details of the setting before the narrative begins - with violence that is horrifying and almost immediate.Themes of class division, class warfare, oppression, and revolution are laid bare as quickly as the narrative picks up. It's all as direct as the visuals are instantly engrossing. This is a post-apocalyptic tale, and thanks to the likes of 'Mad Max,' there are certain expectations we have of features of this nature. 'Snowpiercer' forgoes the most outrageous elements of such conjurations, yet even from the start the imagery is just as vivid. Sets, wardrobe, makeup, lighting, effects, and the entire production design are phenomenal, conveying from the start the grim, gritty, tight, hot, cluttered, filthy atmosphere, the squalor and repression, of the lower classes.This is all essential to the dystopian vision at hand, yet still only marks the beginning of the film, and half of the grand picture. The progression of the narrative shows more of the great train, and exposes with it the other half: The grandeur, extravagance, and hedonism of the upper classes, painted in bright, vibrant colors, pulsing upbeat music, and depictions of health and happiness. The disparity between the end of the train and the front half, and the capstone of the setting, is illustrated in the adoration and worship of Wilford and his engine in a cult of personality that stops just short of religious indoctrination.Through it all, Bong's exquisite attention to detail in his adapted screenplay and behind the camera presents to us every last subtle detail of the setting, every slight nuance in the cast's performances. There are so many scenes, shots, even singular frames in 'Snowpiercer' that are hauntingly beautiful. Why, I almost burst into tears during the first major scene of melee carnage - every spray of blood, step of fight choreography, fine configuration of lighting, and note of composer Marco Beltrami's hypnotizing score converged into a few moments of film so indescribably perfect that I could watch it again and again. And this same level of extraordinary care, and painstaking craftsmanship, is built into all 126 minutes of this movie.The actors assembled for this feature is truly exceptional. Just look through the credits - there are some astounding names here, and even more faces that are very recognizable even if we can't quite place them. One could expound on them all, at length, for hours on end, but for lack of time, it's worth discussing at least a select few. The severity and grace that Tilda Swinton so often inhabits in her roles is counterbalanced here by a nearly caricatured characterization that demands deliberate chewing of scenery, and even still, with her profound skill, she sells it. Ko Asung and especially Song Kang-ho should be very familiar to fans of Bong's films, or Korean cinema more broadly, and their dynamic performances in 'Snowpiercer' further emphasize that broad ignorance of their skill is a matter of terrible negligence. This is to say nothing of the wealth of excellent actors contributing to this tale; all are to be greatly commended.Of course, the most beautiful movie in the world doesn't count for much if it doesn't tell a good story, but this is no slouch, either. The narrative is suspenseful and captivating from the moment it begins, with electrifying thrills to accompany the brutality of the violence, and the abject horror of the scenario that is conveyed. Once more: Bong Joon-ho has more than proven his magnificent capabilities as a filmmaker, in every capacity. There are precious few people in cinema that I would compare to him; I think it's quite safe to say that if Bong is involved in a feature, that is all the more assurance one needs as to its quality.It took me a long time to get around to watching 'Snowpiercer.' One needs to be in a very particular mood to watch post-apocalyptic films. I somewhat avoided this, even, so at no time until recently was I actually aware of the cast and crew involved in the production. But I hastened to watch it once I found out, and I'm just blown away. This is, in many ways, everything one would expect of a film playing in such narrative space, yet its bent is refined in a way that sets it apart from more bombastic tales. The dark, intense, and brooding atmosphere, and the considerable bloodshed, belie an artfulness that is genuinely unexpected from the average picture, let alone one embodying apocalyptic, sci-fi, and or thriller genres. But, to reiterate still again: Given everyone that plays a part here, behind or in front of the camera, I should have known better.I can't say it will be for everyone, but fans of Bong, the cast, or the genres at hand should watch 'Snowpiercer' post-haste if they haven't already: This is a breath-taking film.",Snowpiercer

And he definitely does a great job in this one, surrounded by a fantastic cast, especially Tilda Swinton, who is excellent as Mason and they all follow a great script. The original graphic novel might be worth a read if I can get hold of one.The film is packed with action and heart with emotions running high and hard. It's a crazy story of a horrifying future, yet another dystopia that looks more and more likely to be our real world each day.I didn't see the twist, but I could tell that there would be one.A little bit violent for my tastes, but not overdone.",Snowpiercer
91,truemythmedia,"Strange, Violent, and Thematically Rich",8,5 March 2020,"""Bong has made a career around focusing on the class struggle which all of us face in our daily lives. This film shows us the poorest of the poor and follows them as they slaughter their way through the rich, trying to upset the balance, trying to make the system crumble. It's no secret that we live in a world where the 1% controls 99% of the wealth. Jeff Bezos has more money than he could spend in a dozen lifetimes; but I guarantee there's a single mother that works in one of Bezos' warehouses that is struggling to put food in her kid's belly; worse yet, how many kids in third world countries are forced into labor to produce Nike shoes, Apple products, or name brand clothes?If a system can only continue to run when it exploits the weak and powerless, then that system is already broken. I've never advocated for violence, but this movie makes a rather compelling case that the system through which humanity is surviving upon right now is not only doomed to fail, it absolutely deserves to fail. Give me another ten years of low wages, growing desperation of wealth, corrupt government officials, and inequal treatment in the eyes of the law, and I might well be ready to take to the streets.Remember, 1%: we are the 99%, we outnumber you a million to one, and we are hungry and increasingly angry.While this is far from my favorite Bong Joon Ho movie, I honestly think it's one of his most accessible. This is a fun action flick with some great worldbuilding, some awesome characters, and some truly relevant themes. I wholeheartedly recommend ""Snowpiercer"".",Snowpiercer
92,Amari-Sali,"A man plans a revolution, but how many is he willing to sacrifice for his ultimate goal?",9,12 April 2014,"I have delayed seeing this film for a few weeks now, and after watching it, I do feel like I delayed perhaps the most gratifying experience I have ever had watching a movie. This two hour long epic is the type of film which makes me glad I know how to communicate through writing, because I feel a bit speechless. So, with an intro like that, let's talk about the film.Characters & StoryIn 2014, world leaders have seemingly found a way to end global warming using what is called ""CW7."" A chemical released into the atmosphere which is supposed to undo the majority of the damage human evolution has done over eons. However, what ends up happening is an ice age. One in which a train full of people represent the last remains of humanity.Thus leading us to meet the main character Curtis (Chris Evans) who is the leader of those who live in the back of the train. Now, the way the train is setup is: first class, where all the rich live who seemingly don't work what so ever; economy class, of which there are those who work for the first class; and then there are the freeloaders, who were lucky enough to get on the train. This system has been in place for 17, going on 18, years. People have been born and died on that train, and naturally there have been attempts at revolution. None of which had Curtis at the helm though.Leading us on an adventure in which Curtis, alongside the proposed leader Gilliam (John Hurt); Edgar (Jamie Bell), who seems to be Curtis' right hand man; Tanya (Octavia Spencer), a woman seeking to get back her son; Namgoong Minsu (Song Kang-ho) & Yona (Go Ah-sung), who work together to open the gates and doors separating the tail end civilians from the front; all face off against Mr. Wilford (Ed Harris) and Mason (Tilda Swinton) in an attempt to establish a new order by almost any means necessary.PraiseIt is highly rare for me to sit to the end of a movie's credits, and that is because once the movie seemingly has ended, I feel I have gotten all I could want out of it. However, with this film I was hoping for one more scene, one more gift bestowed before the screen went black. That is how consuming this film is. Within those two hours you find yourself quickly attaching yourself to Curtis' revolution and with each sacrifice made, you want to tighten your fist and join the fight.All this though is thanks to both the acting and story. To begin, Chris Evans, who has come so far since Not Another Teen Movie, fits the tortured hero role so well he seems like he was written by a Greek playwright. His role as the leader of the downtrodden shows those who may never seen Captain America, which his performance is inspiring me to watch, why he will indubitably have lead roles for decades to come. For, just as much as he can play some silly comic role, he can play this deeply troubled soul, whose judgment is questionable, and yet you still see him as a hero no matter what, or who, he sacrifices. Of course the rest of the cast deserves praise as well for they each represent a different type of hope. Curtis represents the hope of change; Tanya represents the hope of a mother; and Namgoong Minsu represents the hope of the future.Of which is perhaps the story's main focus. Every few years there is a rebellion, and all have failed. Yet we get to see this beautifully written rebellion which strangely has the ability to quickly get you wrapped up in characters' lives; make you want to root for them every time a battle is impending; and damn if you aren't torn when some of them seemingly won't make it to see their dreams come forth into reality. But even then, as each glimmer representing hope dies, one shines a bit brighter and you hope it all will be worth it in the end.CriticismHonestly, the sole issue I had in the film was Swinton's character Mason, who seemed almost like a comic relief. The way she spoke, the way the character was acted, I would have wanted her dead even if she wasn't a villain. Also, and maybe I just missed it on occasion, the film employs a universal translator so Curtis and Namgoong Minsu can talk to one another, but sometimes it seems nowhere to be found when they speak. Overall though, there aren't any huge issues which could ruin the experience.Overall: Worth SeeingThis is the type of film you wished was a mini-series. First because it is an adaptation of the graphic novel Le Transperceneige, of which I can only hope there are more details within. Then, secondly, it is because you get so attached to these characters, their hope, and the overall story, that you really don't want things to end. And yet, when you can see the end is near, the film keeps up this interesting pace by switching out the action scenes with the type of reveals which could make your jaw drop, or at the very least surprise you a little bit. And overall, I think this is worth watching because out of all these post- apocalyptic movies that have been coming out over the last few years, this is the first one, I know of, which isn't some young adult book adaptation which seems more focused on the lead's love life over their struggle against their oppressors. Something strangely refreshing, at least to me.",Snowpiercer

94,jadepietro,A Huffin' and a Puffin' and Away They Go,8,31 August 2014,"This film is recommended.The future is once again a bleak vision of failing humanity in filmmaker Bong Joon Ho's latest offering entitled Snowpiercer. This heady parable literally depicting class warfare set aboard a moving train, with the rich and upper-class traveling first class while the poor and oppressed are strictly in cargo. Separating the two sets of passengers are many locked doors and military armed guards, there to establish peace and prevent any uprising. Good luck with that!It is 2031. The world is a cold desolate place. The Ice Age has arrive, with no Scrat in sight. Attempts at balancing global warming have failed. Outside, there are no signs of life, but inside our locomotive are a few disgruntle survivors. Living conditions are getting worse by the mile. Overcrowding and poor sanitation are rampant. Food, at least for the 99% lower class globe-trotters, is a rare commodity while the special 1% elite do wine and dine in luxury service. (Come to think of it, the conditions are quite similar to air travel these days, so let this be a warning to all airlines of the things that may come.) Of course, Snowpiercer. is an allegory and a very entertaining one at that. That the film has a more serious edge in its cautionary ecological message amid the sci-fi fantasy action is even more intriguing and gives the film some gravitas. While the film doesn't always succeed, it more often than not takes the moviegoer to some pretty imaginative sights.Our passenger list of the good, the bad, and the ugly includes: heroic Curtis (Chris Evans) and his sidekick, Edgar (Jamie Bell), sage Gilliam (John Hurt), stoic mother Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and angry father Andrew (Ewen Bremmer), stowaways Namgoon (Song Kang-ho) and his daughter Yona (Ko Ah-sung), and villainous mastermind Wilford (Ed Harris), sadistic Franco the Elder (Vlad Ivanov), and a bucktoothed Fascist Minister Mason (a wonderful Tilda Swinton, in another nearly unrecognizable role). All being mere props to tell an apocalyptic saga of mankind and its foibles. The revolution is on, as the huddled masses break free and march onward to the Eternal Engine in the front of the massive train.The movie moves along briskly, from one set piece to the next, until it finally derails with its common predictability. Too many of stock characters are pure stereotypes, put here exclusively for the melodrama as they overcome every obstacle placed in their way. Battles are fought and lives sacrificed for the good of mankind as they enter each car with new challenging environs to explore. It's an upward struggle all the way. It's sorta like The Poseidon Adventure on ice, sans Shelley Winters doing the backstroke. Snowpiercer (that's the name of the high-speed train) has much to say but not very eloquently. Its tone runs the gamut from serious survival fare to nutty satire about totalitarianism and human greed. (Personally, I more than enjoyed the latter: foremost, a school sequence that was so reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's Brazil for its garishness of color and overwrought performances, especially by Alison Pill as the sweet teacher in charge of her Utopian classroom within this dystopia world. Note the tiny homage too of one of the supporting characters being that director's namesake.)The overall look of the film is eye-catching, even if the dialog is ho-hum. Boon Joon Ho is masterful in capturing the claustrophobic spaces and showcasing the distinctive settings, even if his screenplay is at fault for its monotony and sparse dialog. Still, the film is worth viewing just for the thrilling imagery and total artistry in the production values. Special kudos to Kyung-pyo Hong's superb cinematography and Ondrej Nekvasil's detailed production design.With its international cast and the director's unique visual style, Snowpiercer takes all of its "" I think I can"" power trying to make an emotional impact in this sci-fi genre. With a few better rewrites and more character development, it would have been the little movie that could.

96,Seraphion,Truly worth the wait for it.,7,25 March 2014,"So the buzz for this movie is that it was already done in 2013 and released in some countries around August 2013, but only now released in the US. The word is that the original director's cut of around three- hour long was ""renegotiated"" by the production house The Weinstein Company and re-cut into some two-hour length. It has even my home country of Indonesia in November 2013, but I haven't got the chance to go and see it. If you remember the last scene of ""The Avengers (2013)"", Chris Evans' Steve Rogers was shot with his back to the camera. Well, this is because he has already grown his beard for this movie and was bind with a contract to it.The story follows that in the near future only a few number of people survived the apocalypse of cold frozen death of earth's environment. The disaster was caused by a miscalculated chemical effects, which was at first designed to reduce the global warming effects. Those survivors stay on a single train which has its rails circling the earth, so it never stop. But within the train segregation based on wealth was enforced very violently, where the haves are put in the front section and the poor in the tail section. The lead protagonist Curtis leads the masses of the tail section in a revolution to take the train. Yet at the end, at the front-most section of the train where the engine is, Curtis is left to question himself and humanity. The concept is just as many other dystopian and post-apocalyptic world based fiction, which is quite rampant nowadays. But Snowpiercer isn't aimed specifically to young adults, so you get to see really good action sequences, a little bit more blood splatters, and more vivid dramatization. The axe rumble against the masked men in the early stages is just great. A tight space melee brawl scene with hatchets and axes, blood flashing and splattering to the windows, I think this is should make it into one of the coolest brawl scenes if not for its relatively short duration. The catch is that there is a sick twist with the masked men after the fighting stopped. And what do you know? The fight gets even crazier then. And after a small pause of action through a green house, an aquarium, and a meat freezer, the action continues even more crazily with. a kindergarten teacher with a CzT Skorpion LOL. Honestly, all my life movie twists haven't been so crazy and sick and twisted. Moving on, we get to see what the train really offer the rich, with some long range action. Beauty parlors, swimming pools, bars and a restaurant, and a sauna, where the action continues on. A little past about ten minutes, the pace gets so fast you won't notice that you have gone through more than three-quarts of the whole duration. And you won't believe how the rest of Curtis' crew falls victim one at a time at just sudden times. There's also the story twist about Curtis, Edgar, and Gilliam just right when Curtis reaches Wilford's room. And more even as Wilford speaks. All in all, more and more, from this part and on the movie will ""mind*ck"" you about your morale and conscience. The cast selection is quite nice for a movie not of a Hollywood base. They present nice acting all the entire movie. the Korean cast is amazing and their acting seems natural and blends well with the American actors and actresses. For me personally, the only setback watching this movie is that the Korean part of the dialog is not subtitled on streaming sites so I don't really get the full depth of the story. On terms of makeup and costume, this movie presents just as expected for a post-apocalypse movie, not lacking yet not being hyperbolic. Especially Tilda Swinton's character gets a selection of quirky costumes that support the character building very nicely. On terms of music scoring and soundtrack., I feel that its doesn't meant to be the pickup aspect of the movie. They are just there, slightly noticeable, especially if you are bound to the story and the fast pace. Overall, from me a 7 out of 10 score is suiting for Snowpiercer (2013). And especially for you who are just able to get your hands on this movie via streaming as I did, it's fully worth your while to go and see it.",Snowpiercer

99,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Snowpiercer,5,5 December 2014,"Released in the United States via the summer of 2014, Snowpiercer despite its neat opening credit sequence, is a post-apocalyptic seizure of a movie, a real nightmare. Part Mad Max and part 1995's Waterworld, this is a dirty, violently grubby film that seems to fit the monotoned style of delivering lines courtesy of star Chris Evans. With blood- spattering violence (not to mention queasy, sound-enhancing quality to go along with said violence), what we have here is a flick in which its characters channel the look of down trout homeless people while director Bong Joon-ho provides a claustrophobic setting that's mediocre (despite harboring good intentions and sored ambition). Do I agree with most of today's critics who believe this thing is the mark of a future cult classic? Not so much I tell you. Not so much.Containing a blustery, wintry setting, a script with enough futuristic jargon to provoke major eye rolling, and action scenes where it's almost impossible to see what the heck is going on, Snowpiercer takes place circa 2031. The ice age has arrived with Earth being comprised of nothing but sub-zero temperatures and extinct life expenditures. The only living humans ride a large train that continually travels across the globe. What's strange and at the same time, might make sense in a post-apocalyptic world, is the fact that this elaborate train has a class system. The rich people ride up front (and eat prime steaks) while the poor schleps near the back end eat protein bars made out of cockroaches (yuck!). One man or should I say loner (cantankerous rebel if you wanna get all political) wants to change all that. His name is Curtis Everett and he is played by Chris Evans. The Evans character and his assorted minions want to get to the front of the train. But in their way are the engine's caretaker Wilford (played by Ed Harris) and his icy second in command Mason (Tilda Swinton). What unfurls is a series of drawn out, dialogue-driven scenes followed by stabbings, shootings, and delectable, frozen arm amputation (hey, what can I tell ya, it's cold outside).So yes, this limited release is violent with funky, nasty characters but it's also at times, boring. And as you watch Snowpiercer with lots of cartoonish, CGI effects (mainly within the exteriors), you wonder why capable Oscar winners/nominees like Ed Harris and Tilda Swinton would bother to appear in it. By the looks of things, they're clearly there for the paycheck. I mean, why else would one of them show up in the last twenty minutes spouting off lazy, contrived dialogue while the other gets off on wearing some ugly false teeth. I guess you'd have to ask them. Have fun with that.Anyway, for the people out there who felt compelled to praise this film, I employ you, why salute it for its absurdness? For me, what was on screen seemed too weird to be laudable and at the same time, too disheartening to care about anyone involved. Everything in frame is baited to take its gnarly, dystopian estimation and hammer it to levels of utmost ridiculousness (and not in a good way). After a viewing, I thought what a weird, sickening tryst of a movie that despite a capable cast, needed to be put to pasture. Snowpiercer is out of the box film making that will cause you to either take a long shower or put your body through a high-sheeted car wash. It's a ""snow"" that's a definite no-go.",Snowpiercer
100,Rob_Taylor,About as believable as the Total Recall remake...,5,23 March 2014,"Okay, so I get this movie had some things to say about class and privilege and the lengths people will go to in extremis. However, in wanting to tell a story that makes points, you simply cannot ignore common sense and physics in order to produce your setting.In Snowpiercer, the world has frozen due to scientists meddling with the climate in order to stop global warming. This I can buy, given the explanation at the very start of the movie.What I can't buy into, however, is the fact that all of what is left of humanity is crammed onto a single, gigantic train, that runs in a year-long loop around much of the world.For one thing, the creator of the train has, apparently, invented a perpetual motion machine. Never mind the impossibility of this, let's just think about it for a moment. A machine that runs forever and, presumably, produces more output than it requires to run it. So he puts it in a train? Give me the proverbial effing break! An engine such as that would easily power a small community which could then produce more such engines and so on... until there is plenty of power to keep the world running.But, I guess a train allows for the video-game like linearity of the story's progression, so to hell with common sense, right? There are plenty of plot holes to mention as well.The disgust shown by Chris Evans' character when he learns that the protein bars they've been eating for years are made of insects. I was expecting him to open the container and find dead bodies being churned into food, a la Soylent Green, but it was just bugs. You know... insects, those things that a considerable part of the world consider a part of their diet without issue. This unexplainable disgust is compounded later when Evans reveals his character actually used to eat people in the early days. What Chris? Eating people is less disgusting than bugs! Say it ain't so! Another stupidity is the length of the train. We see a good number of train carriages during the hero's journey, but there are far, far more when you see the ludicrous corner scene, where the train goes around a long bend just so that good guys and bad guys can shoot at each other across a huge gulf. But the bad guy was only about three carriages behind the good guy? Terrible continuity for the sake of a pointless action scene.We also see chicken and other animal carcasses hanging from hooks in a cold car, but nowhere do our heroes ever come across the live animals that they must have somewhere in order to provide the meat.It's also supposed to be so cold outside that flesh freezes solid in a matter of minutes, yet at the end, all that is needed to offset this absolute zero effect is a fur coat. (Apparently they also have furry animals somewhere on the train too...) In short, this movie is so full of holes. Some so big you could drive a train through.As I said at the beginning, by all means use sci-fi to tell a story, but don't make the setting so ridiculous that it invites scrutiny. And if you do, then be prepared for people to point the flaws out.This film had a number of things to say, but the setting and plot holes detract heavily from it, leaving you frowning at the foolishness of it all.SUMMARY: Setting invented by a small child. Plot has more holes than a sieve. Unrealistic fantasy marred by incompetent attention to detail. Try it at your peril!",Snowpiercer
101,brando647,An Amazing Piece of Dystopian Future Fiction,9,15 May 2015,"Since watching SNOWPIERCER, I have spent a good deal of time promoting it to friends, convincing them to seek it out and watch it. There was very little advertising for the film (that I saw) and I want to make sure it gets the attention it deserves because SNOWPIERCER is just awesome. I went in blind, having never read the graphic novel (or heard of it, for that matter), and only knowing that the film had some glowing reviews behind it. I was blown away. It's a gritty film that doesn't let up until the end credits roll. It starts simple enough but grows more complicated as the film's team of freedom fighters edge closer and closer to their destination. The film is set in the near future where the population of Earth had attempted to combat the onset of global warming/climate change but instead cast the planet into an eternal winter where temperatures are too low for life to survive. The planet's sole survivors live aboard a train with a perpetual engine, running it's looping course around the world. Life outside the train is deemed impossible. Society on the train has been sorted out so the affluent passengers live in luxury at the head of the train and the poor are crammed into the rear. As is generally the case, the poor passengers are the rear are tired of living under the boot heel of the rich and plans are set in motion to take control of the engine front of the train.The first thing I noticed about SNOWPIERCER was how incredible the how film looks. The frozen world, with its remnants of the former civilization peeking through the ice and snow, is amazing though there were times when I felt the CG behind it's creation shined through a little. That might just be because the bright white outer world is such high contrast with the dark, filthy confines of the train to which we're first introduced. The production design on this movie was top notch and I hope the team won some acclaim for their work. The train is a character all it's own with a variety of different environments within its compartments as the team make their way from the cramped, cluttered mess of the rear cabin to comfort of the head, including an aquarium with functioning ecosystem and a colorful school for the children where one of the greatest sequences in the film goes down. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone for the fantastic visuals alone but the film, thankfully, boasts an equally impressive cast of characters and brutal action. Make no mistake; SNOWPIERCER earns it's R-rating. And there are some dark revelations near the end of the film that will make you cringe harder than any of the bloody deaths leading up to it. The movie takes the common tale of class warfare and tells it in a gut-punchingly effective manner, giving us one of the best movies of 2014 that most people will not have seen.Finally, a quick rundown of the film's perfect casting: Chris Evans is the film's hero, Curtis. Curtis is a full 180-degree shift from Evans' role as Marvel's Captain America. Curtis is a broken man whose horrible life has finally pushed him to action. He's ruthless and focused. He has one purpose: get to the engine or die trying, there are no alternatives. His mentor is Gilliam, played by John Hurt. Gilliam is the voice of reason in the rear compartment, revered by the poor masses. Jamie Bell is Curtis's closest friend and confidant, Edgar. Edgar is eager for action against the forward passengers and it's the cool confidence in Curtis that keeps him from acting out prematurely. Octavia Spencer and Ewen Bremner provide additional humanity to the struggle as rear passengers who join the revolution when their children are abducted to the front under mysterious circumstances. The film's most memorable performance comes from Tilda Swinton as the voice of the front, Mason. Mason is bizarre and Tilda is fantastic. With strange dentures giving her protruding overbite and her pompous, proper attitude, she scolds the rear passengers as an adult would to a child. She doesn't flinch when a rear passenger is punished and his arm is forced through a porthole into the subfreezing temperatures outside; she merely continues with her speech about how grateful these poor souls should be for the graciousness of Wilford. Wilford is the mysterious figure at the head of the train. The inventor of the perpetual engine. Essentially a god to the inhabitants of the front. Curtis aims to take down this ""god"" and his revolution makes for one amazing movie. Seriously, go watch SNOWPIERCER.",Snowpiercer
102,quincytheodore,An excellent thought-provoking tour of dystopian world and society,9,7 February 2015,"Post-apocalyptic theme has been used repeatedly in recent time, but half of them barely able to depict the theme's fundamental dismay. Snowpiercer is not only successful in creating a drab futuristic wintry world, it's also one of the best masterpieces of sci-fi genre. With outstanding direction, amazing script and truly talented cast, Snowpiercer immerses audience in an escapade like Gattaca and Twelve Monkey did years ago.It tells the story of a constantly moving train in winter apocalypse. This last arc of humanity travels around the world one year at a time, but the passengers are separated in different cars. The tail section occupants in particular suffer from discrimination and entirely terrible inescapable life. Curtis (Chris Evans) leads a rebellion to overthrow the ruling Wilford, keeper of Engine. In the course of one train, the whole civilization of later world is displayed in elegance, both the poverty and opulence.Acting is immensely superb, with Evans delivering one of his best performances to date. He is a reluctant leader with burden from his past and obligation for the future, and Evans walks as such savior passionately. Props to Tilda Swinton for her intentionally annoying character, I swear she reminds me of the irritating figure of authority, namely my old teacher. It takes skill to portray beauty, but even more so to portray unsightly personality.Director Joon-ho Bong, of classic thriller, Memories of Murder, brings such poise to the visual. Each car is different in style with bridging social texture and details of the post-apocalyptic life presented without pause. This is a one of few rare movies that paces itself so marvelously well, it delivers suspense not only with every scenes, but almost every minutes of its run time.The characters are memorable despite they are introduced in short amount of time. Revelations and twists litter the train. Amazingly with so many elements involved, everything seems built with clear purpose. Action might seem in small scale at first, but with swift pace cinematography, fights have incredible thrill. Whether the antagonists arrive at the last car, the journey there will connect the audience better than the partitions its cars do for the passengers.A sharp medium like Snowpiercer doesn't come often, but when it does, it magnificently transports a view around the best of humanity, or the hope of it, when at its worst.",Snowpiercer
103,Sergeant_Tibbs,A wild ride.,7,24 December 2014,"Snowpiercer was pinned to be one of the most popular films of 2013. Now it's simply become one of the most popular films of 2014, the release date hassle has been no hurdle. Getting placed in too many top 10 lists pushed me into finally watching it. And I must admit, it's a wild ride, if a very mixed bag. That said, all its ingredients are strong, some just don't blend or aren't used as wisely as they could have been. These types of high concept films that take many liberties only do so much for me, especially when they rely so heavily on faceless characters, an episodic structure and stylised violence. In small doses it's a thrill, when it gets in over its head it suffers, but for the most part it makes it work.Yeah, Snowpiercer's class allegory is obvious and on the nose, yet relevant, but it's difficult to not fall for the way the limited production design explores the world. It wears its Terry Gilliam influence plainly on its sleeve, even having a key character named after him, but the blend of darkness and satire isn't quite as deftly achieved. Contrary to acclaim, Swinton's animated performance stands out like a sore thumb. I preferred Alison Pill, who proves how committed the film is to the campy side. I did like how ruthless the film can be. Nevertheless, it needed that good trim that Weinstein was keen to give it as it delegates itself too often to extended exposition scenes.

Set aboard a futuristic train circulating an Earth completely frozen over (why isn't important), we follow the plebeian passengers, led by Chris Evans' Curtis, as they make their way from the tail end of the train through to the luxurious front carriages, seeking revenge for their inhumane treatment. With the story more concerned about offering a division-of-class allegory than ensuring airtight logic, it would be exceptionally simple to pull apart the plot with snarky glee; but in doing so would be to miss the point entirely. A more relevant criticism, however, is that in his quest to generate a scathing indictment of the increasing class divide we're seeing in the real world, Joon-ho allows his overwhelmingly loquacious finale to drag on for an eternity, thus lessening it's gut-punch impact. Where big points are scored though is with the kinetic fight sequences; an ultra-violent skirmish with dozens of people bearing axes, spears, knives and mallets, is an awe-inspiring sight and more than holds its own against other, bigger budgeted contenders for melee of the year. With its wackily dark sense of humour – Tilda Swinton's obnoxious official a source of nervous laughter throughout – and confronting subplots (largely exposed as twists in the final act), Snowpiercer is not going to be everybody's cup of tea. If you enjoy ambiguity, evocative themes and a touch of the surreal, then you should seek this out immediately.",Snowpiercer

107,pyrocitor,He loves only cold,8,2 August 2015,"A Korean-funded, American-distributed, dystopic sci-fi action film based on a French graphic novel, helmed by a renowned South Korean director with a distinctly international cast, starring Captain America - it's no wonder Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer (aka: the best James Bond title that never was) was a bit of a difficult sell. There's something slyly appropriate about such an oddball product of globalization telling the tale of the cobbled-together remains of the human race, struggling to stay alive while trapped in a perpetually moving train - a premise so claustrophobic it would give Alfred Hitchcock the jitters. And while this eclectic fusion of influences and sensibilities may be occasionally as messy and perplexing as it sounds, there's no denying that Snowpiercer is a truly unique and thrilling watch, the rare thriller willing to take chances and push the envelope to the point where audiences have genuinely no idea what to expect. Watching it unfurl is exhausting but enriching, all the more impressive in its incongruous oddities.One thing Bong is not concerned with is subtlety. Between the grimly stripped down dialogue and exposition and the titular train's linear schematic, the film's scathing exploration of socioeconomic class disparity in an apocalyptic setting is not so much subtext as explored with the playful simplicity of a fairy tale. There is simply no time for beating around the bush in Bong's chilling (ha) future. Instead, ideologies are beaten in with even more aggression than the eerily nonchalant outbursts of extreme violence that periodically surge up sans fanfare. Here, the grotesque mouthpiece of the train's elite (exquisite scene-stealer Tilda Swinton, in a deliciously campy Margaret Thatcher parody) cackles metaphors about head- and-foot-shoes-don't-go-on-your-head-don't-you-know, just as a psychotically chipper, pregnant schoolteacher (the note-perfect Allison Pill) mmm-bops propaganda tunes along with her class before letting loose with an uzi over their heads at the band of insurgents. Eat that, Bad Teacher. Indeed, while the film's ""workers – unite!"" plot may feel well-trod, the trappings are anything but. The Snowpiercer itself is a fascinatingly imaginative set, with Hong Kyung-pyo's nimble cinematography zipping along scores of impressively grimy extras, a gruesome 'protein block' factory (a gross-out bit worthy of Tim Burton), surprise aquarium and terrarium, and engineside glam-rock-rave-hall. The slow reveal is what the train's architect (Ed Harris, capably dusting off his Truman Show serene zealot) refers to as a 'fragile ecosystem' – an apt description, given how much the set grunts and wheezes like a living thing. It's not entirely smooth sailing (chugging?) therein – the film sputters briefly with a somewhat slow buildup and an odd lull in the middle, and the dialogue is occasionally a tad too evident as being written by a filmmaker working in his second language (Chris Evans' tearful ""I know what people taste like I know that babies taste the best"" confession probably played better in Korean). Similarly, finding a satisfying resolution to a dystopic thriller is a notorious struggle (not too contrived and saccharine; not too bleakly anticlimactic), but Snowpiercer's climax, straddling almost bombastic overstatement (is there any train thriller where the train doesn't crash?) with a curiously intimate coda (polar bears are cute), and somehow feels just right for the somber wackiness throughout. It's no 'train-going-through-the-tunnel-swell-of- romantic-music-fade-to-black', but I'll take it. Ultimately, the film is at its best when kickstarting its ragtag revolution. Bong crafts a helluva setpiece (check out the axe-fight plunged into darkness as the train enters a tunnel for a slice of pure, delicious tension), and the film thrums along with an infectious, nervy energy, with Marco Beltrami's musical score ticking along like a ferocious steamclock. It's in these early days that Snowpiercer surges to life as a textbook example of how creative, engrossing, poignant, and downright fun the action genre can be in the right hands. The film's cast wisely generally opt for deadly serious, which helps ground many of the film's more eccentric elements. Chris Evans is perfectly cast as the grim anti-leader of the revolt, spinning his boundless charisma into a perfect inversion of Steve Rogers. Kang-ho Song blends stoicism and comedy with remarkable ease as the train's drug-addled engineer, while Ah-sung Ko is luminous as his addict protégée. Jamie Bell finds welcome moments of warmth and humanity, an excellent foil to Evans' deadpan, while Octavia Spencer skillfully adds class and pathos to the proceedings as a headstrong mother pursuing her abducted son. Finally, genre veteran John Hurt continues to monopolize the field on wispy, craggy reassuring mentor figures as the revolution's tentatively hopeful mastermind. Picture the end of the world brought to life by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Jean- Pierre Jeunet, and you'll likely have a good sense of what Snowpiercer has in store. And who could expect anything less from the writer/director of the fantastically enjoyable monster romp The Host? Bong Joon-ho here cements himself as an essentially vibrant, creative voice, and an influence that the frustratingly stagnant American film industry could desperately benefit from further collaboration with. Hopefully the film's divisive response hasn't discouraged him; the prospect of no follow-up even more ambitious, strange, and captivating than Snowpiercer is an icy, desolate future indeed. -8.5/10",Snowpiercer

109,Prashast_Singh,Snowpiercer Review: A fairly decent science fiction from South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho.,6,9 September 2017,"Movie: Snowpiercer (15)Rating: 3/5I had heard a lot about this South Korean-Czech science fiction-action drama SNOWPIERCER. Coming from the renowned South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, who's known to make acclaimed films, this one slightly falls short of what I had expected, but it's the director's imaginative presentation that works for the film.Unlike most (not all) South Korean films, SNOWPIERCER is treated in a grander way. The scale is pretty high, and the imagination, at the highest peak. The film's icy cool visuals are breathtaking and are enough to entertain you. The CGI is literally so good, that you'll end up liking it, though not fully.The problem? Well, SNOWPIERCER does have excellent visuals, intense action sequences and top notch performances, but the execution is pretty average. The film's emotionally very weak. Rather extremely. There's nothing one can feel for the characters, and this is the part where the director doesn't succeed. The lack of tension kills the excitement in certain portions. There are many sequences which look simply forced into the plot. But the editing is still decent, as it saves the film from getting ruined. One could have expected some dark satirical humour in the film, but sadly it doesn't have much.The climax is quite a hurried-up one, but the ending is definitely a good one.Chris Evans is excellent: he plays his part extremely well and keeps the viewers engaged. Song Kang-ho does an excellent job as always, and there's no way you'll be disappointed with him. Go Ah-sung is decent, and so is her act. The other actors aren't mindblowing but the performances surely are a major plus for the film.The cinematography is quite decent. The action sequences are very well choreographed, and there's a good usage of sound effects throughout them. The icy cool visuals are, as I said before, breathtaking and without a second thought, I can say that they are a major reason why the film never annoys or irritates you despite of a lack of proper tension, emotions and unconvincingly presented twists.The film is indeed gripping, and I mean it.SNOWPIERCER is a good film that can be watched at least once, for the concept it presents is quite imaginative, and the action combined with the visuals works extremely well. But still, have less expectations, especially if you like emotional films. The film's action-packed, adventurous, visually impressive but at the same time it's neither too thrilling & surprising, nor outstanding and mindblowing.",Snowpiercer

111,Stephen_A_Abell,Stop The Train... I Want To Get Off...,6,31 December 2020,"Before I get into the review, here are my ratings for the movie.The story gets 0.25 out of 2:
The Direction a 1.25:
The Pacing receives a 1.75:
While the Acting gets 1.25:
And my Enjoyment level earns a 0.75 out of 2:
Snowpiercer, therefore, receives a total of 5.75 out of 10.To begin with, I have to state, Snowpiercer is one well filmed and superbly acted piece of gobbledegook I've had the misfortune to watch.Though the performances are well above par and the direction superb, it's the story that completely ruins the film. Through mankind's rush to end global warming, because we cannot trust Mr Jo & Josephine Public to do the right thing to prevent their own extinction, governments seed the air with a chemical to reduce the heat. However, instead of decreasing the temperature to livable levels, it sends the Earth into a new Ice Age. This new era comes upon us so quickly that it eliminates everything on the planet, except for one perpetually travelling choo-choo.This chuffing choo-choo represents a microcosm of humanity. At the rear of the train are the dregs of humanity. While at the front are the rich and opulent. And this is where the story falls flat on its face. If this is humanity, then we ALL deserve to perish in the frozen wastes.When the well-to-do snatch a couple of kids from the tail-end of mankind it forces the down'n'dirty to rebel and fight their way to the front of the train.But, for what purpose? It's not to save the children because the tail-enders have been planning this attack well before the kidnapping. Well, the reason is never revealed to us. And, that is the point. It's all pointless.As we progress through the train, things become even sillier and end up being downright nonsensical and stupid. For example, there's a scene when the hero, Curtis, sees the ingredients of the protein bars they've been eating every day. They're made from ground-up cockroaches and bugs. God knows where they've been getting these from. But hey, you're not supposed to ask these questions. It's understandable that poor old Curtis nearly upchucks into the mix. That is, until, we get to a later scene where he freely admits to eating people, and babies are the most delicious of the crowd. I'm sorry but aren't bugs better than cannibalism? Stupid and lazy writing, all constructed for shock value and relies on you not using your brain.There are lots of similar continuity errors throughout the story. For example, the toffs are scarfing down steak, and we are shown a meat freezer with chicken and cow carcasses strung up. However, where are the livestock? And what are they sustaining them on? Next, there's the sheer waste of hard-boiled eggs scene. Where the hell did all these eggs come from? The whole thing is bloody ludicrous.But none of this is as bad as the dialogue poor Tilda Swinton is forced to vomit out. I felt ashamed and embarrassed for her. She pushes through all the diatribe and executes one of the best performances in the film. I now understand why there's more action than narrative. But, even the combat scenes are not without their idiocy. This is evident in the mass fight scene where they stop killing one another for thirty seconds, allowing them enough time to wish each other Happy New Year. WTF.God, I could go on forever about all the imbecilic errors in the story, like the aquarium, and the school, and the druggies, and the way they keep calling the doors gates, but let's get onto something better.Though Ho is a dreadful writer, his directional skills are excellent. This film is a powerhouse of style and finely staged action sequences. He delivers to the audience all the eye-candy they could want or could devour. Because he's limited to space, he had to find ways to make the scenes interesting, exciting, and atmospheric. This is done through staging, lighting, and varied camera angles. Ho knows how to make a film. What's better is Ho also knows how to use variations in pace to construct a rollercoaster of excitement and tension.Though he too adds to the ridiculousness of the film in the singing teacher scene. By the time we get to this scene, we've waded through most of the worst story ever put to film. When the good-as-gold teach started to warble, and her desk-come-piano began to revolve, I came close to pushing the off button.Here's the thing: In retrospect, I probably should have. It would have saved me from the awful and morbidly preposterous ending.John Hurt's name. in the cast list, provided the reason to watch Snowpiercer. And Hurt is good as Gilliam. He's his usual stoic and iconic self. I find it amazing one guy can add power, strength, and credibility to a movie by appearing on the screen.The film belongs to Tilda Swinton as Mason. And as I stated before, this is down to the fact she delivers an impeccable characterisation no matter what nonsense the writers had her spouting.Chris Evans as Curtis. mooches along giving his hard-as-nails stare and macho-grumbling his lines, until he breaks down and cries about his past. This sobbing and tear-drenched Evans is terrible. He can easily do a hardman, but emotions are definitely not in his talent bag.Ed Harris is, as ever, Ed Harris, doing his best Ed Harris. Will this guy ever try getting into a character.However, Snowpiercer should have won the Worst Actor Ever award. This would have gone to the bad guy of the picture, Franco The Elder, played with ultimate lacklustre by Vlad Ivanov. This guy is so bland you forget about him, even when he's on the screen. He literally meanders through the film as he does the train.Considering everything, this is a dreadful story, and it's the film and the acting that gave the whole project my above-average rating. Ordinarily, with a score of 5.75, I'd be recommending the film. However, in this exception, I'd advise giving the film a wide berth, unless you enjoy downright stupid stories. But remember there are way better flicks for your attention, so go watch one of them instead.Now blow the doors... they're doors, not bloody gates, you morons. And jump off the choo-choo and check out my The Final Frontier list to see where this badly written microcosm of mankind came off the rails. Mostly everything on the list is more entertaining to watch so you can choose one of these to view instead.Take Care & Stay Well.",Snowpiercer
112,brchthethird,"A smarter-than-usual action film, and a great alternative to the usual summer fare",8,14 November 2014,"SNOWPIERCER has been one of my most anticipated movies since I first heard about it last year. I eagerly followed all the news I could get my hands on, and was one of many who bristled at the thought of Harvey Weinstein going snip-happy over it for a theatrical release. Thank goodness that never came to pass. So, now that I've seen it, was it worth the wait? Did it live up to my expectations? I would say the answer to that question is an unequivocal yes. This movie was definitely worth the wait, although there are a few aspects of it that slightly dampened the experience.The story is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth where a chemical released into the atmosphere, ostensibly/hopefully to alleviate global warming, causes Earth to turn into a frozen wasteland. Humanity's few survivors are packed into a perpetually moving train designed and conducted by Wilford, a mysterious person who has a godlike status among the passengers. During their time on the train, society has solidified into a rigid class system (not unlike real life sometimes) that is separated by the different cars on the train. Chris Evans plays Curtis, a young man who plans to lead a revolt and take control of the engine. With that, I'll stop describing the plot because it is best to go into this film with as little information as possible, so as not to spoil anything.Thematically, the film deals with class struggle and the ways that people are controlled to keep social order. The film doesn't really beat you over the head with its ideas, but there are a few sequences which present them in an effective way. Performance-wise, there is little to complain about. Chris Evans does a marvelous job, and this might be the best performance of his career (so far). He plays the part of a reluctant leader with appropriate amounts of brooding, and outrage at what he finds out on his way to the front of the train. John Hurt plays Gilliam (a nod to Terry Gilliam, no doubt), an old man in the tail car who is sort of a mentor to Curtis. There were also decent showings by Jamie Bell and Octavia Spencer as two of Curtis' fellow revolutionaries. However, the most entertaining performance was given by Tilda Swinton as Minister Mason. She is nearly unrecognizable, and gives a delightfully cheeky performance as what is essentially a stooge for the establishment. She was given several great character moments, and she nailed them all.Visually, I thought that Bong Joon-Ho (and his cinematographer) effectively and realistically created a world in which to immerse the audience. Not everything is explained or spoon-fed, which was also a plus. The CGI wasn't as good as in mainstream Hollywood films, but it wasn't terrible either. About the best you can expect from a lower-budget Korean-Czech co-production, and pretty high by Korean standards. Mostly, the visual effects showing the frozen outside world looked good, and the effects used inside the train worked as well.Overall, I thought the movie was excellent. The only real gripe I have is with some occasional pacing issues, although once the plot is set in motion it never lets up. I highly recommend you see this movie, not only to support smaller films but because its more intellectually engaging than half of the crap that passes for entertainment these days.",Snowpiercer
113,muamba_eats_toast,Fantastic,9,18 March 2020,Yes it's a little far fetched at times but it's a just what the overall story represent socially not every small part of a dystopian future being entirely accurate. Chris Evans was absolutely fantastic in the lead role also with many great performances in support. Overall a thoroughly interesting and enjoyable film.,Snowpiercer
114,proud_luddite,It could have been better,6,9 June 2019,"In a near dystopian future, the world is in another ice age. The few survivors all exist on a constantly moving train that moves all around the world. There is an extremely unjust class system on the train with the very poor and oppressed in the tail cars and the pampered rich in the front. A revolution is inevitable.The first hour includes much gratuitous gang violence, some of it quite in-your-face. This concept and style have been done in many films so there's nothing new here. Admittedly though, the action scenes are well executed. The storyline is also fascinating much of the time especially in the revelation of each train car and how it shows the extreme class separations. The production and set designs are among the movie's strongest assets.The theme of class oppression is a worthy one especially considering our current global economic system which gets worse each year. ""Snowpiercer"" takes on this theme well but there are some scenes which seem bizarre and out of place thus making the film incoherent at times. Therefore, it was a mixed result.",Snowpiercer
115,saptesh786,To survive life run a train forever !,4,15 March 2019,First of all that it is not a science fiction. The story is in 2030 where no advance technology looks into force and used. All incidents happen in only a traditional old ways. Actually after first scene in the train I feel that I am watching old age move where slaves are captive for some work. But mind reminds me that the story we are seeing is in 2031. How great! Secondly what is the need for run a train round the year and year again to surviving from cold? Would not there any option in future instead of running roller coaster years over? Both things made me not to connect the movie. So I disappointed seeing it. The story is unnecessarily stretched long and what is end? End is not so effective. It would have been better and impressive only need of a strong will of director. Otherwise story plot was good. Presentation made it failed. Also it is a foolish idea that a small boy is used as a machine part of the engine (in 2030?). So confused and boring movie. Not much entertainer. Acting department is just average. None of characters is memorable. Eventually not for recommendation. Watch only your own.,Snowpiercer
116,suite92,Class warfare in a totally absurd dystopian future train ride.,1,17 March 2016,"Well before the film's start, humanity attempted to reverse global warming using machinery of some sort. The machinery worked too well. Results were not as expected: the planet descended into an ice age.As the film opens, the remainder of humanity rides on a single train that circles the globe. The cars that make up the train are strongly typed by class. In upper class cars, the food is good and there is light and colour. In the lower- classed cars, there is much darkness and foul-looking bricks that pass as food. The wretched food is distributed by armed and armored thugs who treat the riders in a cruel and authoritarian way.Snowpiercer is the name of the train as well as the film. The train has to clear the tracks of falling and drifting snow in order to continue its trek. This is probably the most absurd part of this film. Anyone who has experienced living for prolonged periods in snow country would reject a train being able to do this. Also, in such a long circuit, avalanches somewhere on the route during 17 years would be certain.During the film, the classes war upon one another. Will this violent dialectic produce any forward progress?ConclusionsThe movie's backdrop is ridiculous from beginning to end. The proposed source of food looked like it would support one person, if they promised to eat every other year. There is no possible route for this train to trace around the globe. The map presented of the route includes long segments that are only supported by ice. Just how was such a thing constructed after the massive failure of the world's economies? Answer: it was not. The power source for this train? Never revealed, unfortunately; at least I would have had something to laugh at. The implementation of the 'closed ecosystem' was a joke.The only real energy I saw in this movie was the mutual class hatred. Perhaps this is why this dreadful film receives any positive regard. Some like class warfare. I do not.",Snowpiercer
117,maurice_yacowar,Last human survivors on train doomed by social inequality,7,23 August 2014,"South Korean director Joon-ho Bong's first English film, Snowpiercer, spells out its political theme rather explicitly. Our world depends upon order. Its pragmatic rulers will use all means to sustain a rigid class structure, with everyone knowing their place. When the underclass revolts — as it does here — the derailment is catastrophic. The plot, then, is more reactionary than we might think of a film that celebrates a brave, gory revolution.The film is a post-apocalyptic version of the 15th Century story of the ship of fools. Mankind is represented as a cross-section of human types on a voyage together. It's one of our most recurrent plots. In Stagecoach it was a trip to Lordsburg. The genre anticipates the '60s insight: Life is a trip. Here the Narrenshippe is a railway train circling the frozen wasted globe carrying the only survivors of a humanly effected ice age. (Take that, damn global warming advocates!) The deep-freeze is a more cinematic spectacle than a meltdown would be, but it mainly serves as a metaphor for the frigid heart that allows the inhumanity of an unyielding class structure.The railroad owner Wilford (Ed Harris) has made his train a completely self-supporting eco-system. We don't see how he replenishes the carcasses in the refrigerator car (!). We see the aquarium that produces his sushi, though, so we can extrapolate. Elsie and her herd must be in another car.The train emblematizes our class structure. The elites inhabit the front section, with their disco, fine dining, tailors, dentists, greenhouse, etc. The tail end houses the nebbishes, kept in vile conditions, to produce children to feed into the machinery that drives the train. The advantaged children are pampered in a sprightly classroom where they are fed eggs and propaganda, both hard boiled.To preserve the balance the rabble are periodically thinned, including by the odd rebellion such as this one, which our hero Curtis (Chris Evans) is under the illusion he is helping the caboose sage Gilliam (John Hurt) mount. The idealist is gobsmacked to find his hero Gilliam has been in cahoots with the arch-villain Wilford all along. We sensed that when Gilliam tried to stop the rebellion before it went all the way. In this film the system can't be beat without bringing down the whole world.Presumably for commercial purposes the film tacks on as happy an ending as it can imagine. An avalanche set off by a rebel's bomb destroys the train. That rebel has sensed the beginning of a thaw so he wants to get off. But the only survivors are his train-born, constantly stoned daughter and a five-year-old black boy Curtis has rescued from the gears. That pair don't exactly promise the regeneration of the human race. Adam and Eve they are not. Especially not when a polar bear appears on the new horizon. We're spared the really happy ending — i.e., the bear hands them a Coke — and the really depressing ending — i.e., the bear has a two-course meal. But those survivors are supposed to make us feel relieved that humanity wasn't extinguished in that crash.The revolutionaries may have all died but their spirit lives on. Until the bear wipes its chops.",Snowpiercer

Definitely quirky but not ridiculous,9,26 July 2014,"The world has got all chilly and the last survivors of human kind are stuck on a train that endlessly chugs its way around the globe. If you can buy that then you are in for a treat. If not might you might want to sit this one out because it gets a tad stranger.I love this film. There is a lot of stuff in here about class systems, utilitarianism and all the high brow things my pretentious side craves. But there is also a lot of action, suspense and fight scenes to satisfy the kid in me.High octane action scenes cut into quirky set pieces seamlessly, and the linear journey of our heroes (from carriage to carriage) adds a surreal tinge to the film. The art here is that it is still potentially believable; at no point is this movie in danger of swimming off the deep end.Great acting, story, lighting, production etc. The CGI scenes are a bit poor. If you are looking for something a little different stop here.",Snowpiercer
120,sharky_55,Rumble rumble rattle rattle it will never die!,8,15 July 2015,"Bong Joon-ho's Snowpiercer plunges the viewer right into a post-apocalyptic setting where a frozen Earth bares little human residence but for a train, endlessly running on perpetual motion and circling the same tracks over and over. It wastes little time except for a short news broadcast voice over to explain this, and even less to introduce our main characters and their lives. This is perhaps simultaneously a weakness and a strength to the narrative; when the old mentor Gilliam is executed, or when Curtis' trusty second in command Edgar is killed, there is little back-story or depth to their characterisation which makes it difficult for an audience to empathise. Yet that is paid back in full and even more later in Evans' best acted scene of the film, a dramatic monologue of his past which fully connects the hints and symbolisms throughout his journey of making it to the front. And that then culminates in Curtis' final symbolic action to sacrifice his arm to save Timmy. To finally become a leader indeed, but not the one that Wilford was envisioning. The world and setting of Snowpiercer is quite detailed and meticulous which shows the excellence of the set design which gradually changes as the group moves forward. Tony Zhou (EFAP) points out a significant shooting decision to laterally depict the conflicts of Curtis while he moves forward; to save Edgar or to take Mason hostage, to relinquish command over the train or save Timmy. It's a subtle and nuanced way of unveiling and establishing the setting which works because of the lack of the aforementioned introductory exposition. Other scenes like the first flash of sunlight after a grimly lit first 20 minutes or so also contribute to this, as do little details like the crowd scrambling for the tossed aside cigarette, or the tiny translator that looks like a old walkman but is beyond any modern device. The narrow train also comes with drawbacks unfortunately, as they make for a cramped area for the few inevitable actions scenes. It means the choreography is limited to hacking and slashing (suitable but not showcased well) and masked with shaky-cam as well as dim lighting (later a misty sauna). When the action does divert from the gritty grindy affair it is the form of a practically nameless shirtless and tattooed fighter, skilled with the knives and offering not even a single line of brooding dialogue. It's one of the few thematic lapses in the film, given he originates from the lower end of the train, supposedly starved, malnourished and given no space or freedom for the parkour-like acrobatics he pulls. Aside from this Joon-ho takes great care in establishing a second level within the narrative of metaphoric themes of class, rebellion and struggle. Little instances in the film makes callbacks and thematic links to tie it all together. When Curtis and Grey shootout on the bend, a tiny snowflake drifts in from a bullet hole and Nam gazes in wonder, which also occurs as they cross the New Year's bridge and he does his yearly inspection. Mason makes the off-hand remark about the fragilely balanced ecosystem of the aquarium and ta-da, this has much larger implications in the explanation of the entire train. Same with the initially unexplained hand gesture which later reveals itself to have darker meaning. In the end, Yona and Timmy are thrown into a utterly inhospitable and icy world, the polar (heh) opposite of the grinding machine they have lived in all their lives as train babies. And yet against all odds, they encounter life, contradicting the very mantra of the divine keeper of the sacred engine. It's a very ambiguous question that the conclusion offers; is it better to continue on the never-ending tracks, committing atrocities to keep the engine going, or gain freedom, ever for a little while? What would Curtis have chosen, had he not been forced a hand by Nam, the one who seeks to break the system? It's an illusion so deeply ingrained in even schoolchildren, yet one man refuses to believe it. As a side note, No other individual parrots the propaganda more diligently than Tilda Swinton's Mason, unrecognisable underneath a heavy layer of makeup and precise costuming. Her performance is perfectly grotesque and slightly over the top, her thick rimmed spectacles and garish smiles combining in a very effectively unpleasant way. She sways and hums to the Wilford ode even as she is being held prisoner, and gives an absurd if not metaphorically relevant speech about knowing your rightful place amongst the repetition of this key theme throughout the film. She's lofty when in command yet crumbles easily when the scales tip ever so slightly and that is exactly the sort of vile place-holder villain that fits in so well in Snowpiercer. When Curtis reaches the engine, you can almost hear the cogs and gears turning in his head. Wilford, as it turns out, might not have been wrong after all.",Snowpiercer

The entire civilization living inside of this one bullet train to nowhere is beautifully crafted. But you know this is a Bong movie when you consider its message. It's all about class. Many parallels between this and Parasite, right down to the people living underneath the floorboards.",Snowpiercer
123,KnightsofNi11,One for the ages,8,20 November 2014,"In an age where the science fiction film market is suffocated by sequels, prequels, remakes, and reboots, nothing is more refreshing than an original high concept science fiction action flick that is actually executed well. This makes Korean director Bong Joon-ho's American directorial debut Snowpiercer an exhilarating breath of fresh air in this stagnating genre. Snowpiercer takes us to a post-apocalyptic world where the entirety of humanity lives on a train that constantly circles the globe after the world has frozen over due to a failed climate change experiment. The unstoppable train essentially acts as a metaphor for social class warfare with the ""peasants"" stuffed into the train's tail section, while rich elites enjoy the luxuries further up the train. With everyone in their correct preordained place the train runs smoothly. That is until Curtis, played by Captain America, leads a revolution of tail-sectioners up the train to end the oppression and kill the elusive Wilford, the inventor of the ""sacred engine"" which runs the train who, although no tail-sectioners have ever met him, lives at the front of the train. Curtis and his revolutionary members fight their way from the back of the train, learning a lot of harrowing things about humans and society along the way. As an avid lover of science fiction few things make me happier than seeing the triumph and success of an original science fiction film, especially in 2014. Snowpiercer is based on a comic book series that I haven't read, but as far as I know the only similarities between the comic and the film are the train and the frozen Earth it circles. Other than that everything about Snowpiercer is an original tale, brilliantly crafted and intelligently presented. Snowpiercer isn't a handholding exercise that over explains every little thing. It's a film that forces you to pay attention as you get to piece together the world and the backstory as you ride along. It makes for a story that unfolds at an exciting pace, always keeping you guessing right up to the end where events take place that you never could have seen coming. Snowpiercer is one of the smartest action packed thrill rides I've seen in a long time. There's a pleasing amount of depth to this story that draws a lot of sympathy and keeps you wanting more. That is paired with great visuals and some of the most exciting fight sequences to sink your eyeballs into in a while. There's a particular scene involving axes and fish that gets me worked up every time no matter how much I watch it. The great thing about Snowpiercer is even if the story does nothing for you and you lose interest in all the characters and plot, you're still left with a wickedly fun action film. Of course, Snowpiercer doesn't come without its flaws, but fortunately they are flaws that don't impede any enjoyment of the film, and they by no means hold this otherwise fantastic flick back. Problems mainly stem from the writing and acting, here. The script is a little expository at times (but it's high concept; it almost has to be), and some of the dialogue is pretty on the nose and comes out with a tasteful side of cheese. Some moments don't come across very genuine, and others are just melodramatic. The acting pulls me to both sides. On one hand you have stellar performances by Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris as villains. Then you have the film's two main Korean actors, Song Kang-ho and Ko Ah-Sung who make compellingly entertaining junkies, and then smaller roles by great actors like John Hurt and Allison Pill. But, and I'm probably not the first to say this, Chris Evans is not the best actor. He's got enough good looks and charm to carry a franchise like Captain America, but when it comes to darker more serious roles he isn't quite as convincing. He doesn't quite have the acting chops to be taken seriously, but he, like the other flaws of the film, don't stop me from enjoying Snowpiercer. If you like sci-fi there's honestly no reason you shouldn't see this. It is a shining example of great filmmaking on a technical and visual level, as well as incredible original storytelling. Snowpiercer isn't a film you enjoy along with your popcorn and then forget about instantly. It's a film that, yes, you enjoy the hell out of along with your popcorn, but you'll be left thinking about it long after its over, the tell-tale sign of a great movie.",Snowpiercer

125,petra_ste,When it's cold I'd like to die,5,1 June 2014,"Writer/director Bong Joon-ho made Memories of Murder and The Host, two exceptional movies everyone loved. Then he made Snowpiercer and it's a mess. What happened?1) Sci-fi does not work this way. It might be science fiction is tricky. In its cousins horror and fantasy, stuff just happens. The dark lord forges magic rings, Jedi knights use the Force, vampires and werewolves are simply there. If you say a scientist foolishly poured toxic wastes into a river and created a monster, it's enough. Sci-fi, however, should withstand closer scrutiny - especially sci-fi with lofty ambitions of social commentary. It doesn't have to be airtight, but it should hold against criticisms a fifth-grader could come up with in a minute.Basic premise has believably sinister potential - mankind destroys Earth through global warming, environment goes crazy, new ice age, homo homini lupus. But Snowpiercer has the survivors huddled up on a giant train which travels around the globe in perpetual motion on a railway requiring no maintenance whatsoever. The laws of thermodynamics say hello; logic says goodbye. The absurdity of this quickly becomes the elephant in the room, and you can't follow what happens without its trunk constantly nudging your attention.2) Social commentary does not work this way. Maybe the whole thing is powered simply by fascist billionaire Ed Harris' smug zealotry. The train has a strict class system separating the rich and the poor. The rich thrive on luxury, sushi and orange gardens, as they exploit the poor and feed them insect cookies. Without a strong leadership the system would collapse, claims the villain, so what is freedom worth, and yada yada yada. It's all so heavy-handed and on the nose - Wells did it better a century ago with his Eloi and Morlocks.3) Scriptwriting does not work this way. So the science is bogus, what about the fiction? I understand the appeal of the premise for a writer/director in terms of visual storytelling: the unique and constantly evolving location; moments with great cinematic potential, such as a chilling revelation involving an approaching gallery.Still, Snowpiercer falters with its uneven tone and misplaced comic relief. Tilda Swinton's character, supposedly a fascist-like figure of cruel authority, is written and performed like a snippy Hogwarts teacher. A bunch of axe-brandishing maniacs wave a salmon as a Monty Python-ish threat to the rebellious have-nots; the hero later slips on the fish during a fight, Wile E. Coyote-like. The result is distracting and rather silly.5/10",Snowpiercer
126,Ruskington,Only worth watching for the Willy Wonka conspiracies,5,21 July 2020,"While I'm more than open to this kind of film, Snowpiercer is just a bit too far-fetched and illogical for me to really get into. Some of the scenes and plot developments are frustratingly nonsensical, even in the context of dystopian fantasy. However, the online video essay (see YouTube) that proposes the idea that Snowpiercer is in fact a delayed sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory may well be one of my favourite movie analyses of all-time. It is such a creative and jaw-dropping hypothesis that it is worth watching both films just to understand the argument.",Snowpiercer

128,MihaiSorinToma,A failed execution of a great idea,4,16 August 2017,"After nearly all humanity goes extinct as a result of a failed climate change experiment, the remaining board a self sustaining train which laps the earth in precisely one year. In it, people are ""organized"" in classes, some living in high luxury and some in complete misery, almost eating each other. From the last car, Curtis and a group of rebels decide to begin a riot which will hopefully grant them enough power to change the situation. From then, a whole struggle emerges, and we follow it till the other end of the train, which holds some secrets of its own.It's a movie which has a brilliant idea and still manages to screw it up, big time, in terms of execution. Although highly unlikely (they could have tried the ""new formula"" on a smaller scale first rather than using it like retarded monkeys on the whole planet), the post apocalyptic situation brings a fantastic atmosphere, presented sometimes with splendid scenery. The train itself is unlikely as hell, how the track remained usable after a whole year of icy weather is mind boggling, or how the train was so isolated from the outside conditions, or how the freezing air didn't manage to get inside after some idiots decided to shoot one another directly through the window. Leaving these ""small"" inconveniences behind, the action itself is simply appalling. From the character's decisions to their acts, nothing good or at least marginally enjoyable can be found in the entire plot. Similar to the entire movie, the finale is as retarded as it could be, leaving you with practically nothing as a satisfaction.I'd say it's more dramatic than happy, if you can find anything related to happiness in it. Its trailer showed good promise with its gorgeous scenery and intense action scenes but the execution leaves a whole movie to be wished for. A bad movie as a result of a bad plot and a bad course of events.",Snowpiercer
129,abisio,Another great movie from The Host (the Korean blockbuster ),8,24 March 2014,"First of all be prepared. If you saw the Korean movie The Host (about a monster coming out from a river) and you liked; be prepared. This one is as good and as dark as the other with a very sour ending. If you did not; be aware that despite several well known American and British actors like Chris Evans (Captain America), Tilda Swinton, Jaime Bell, Ed Harris and Octavia Spencer; this a dark reflection of the human condition; nothing to do with standard Hollywood fare (in fact is a Korean production).Due to a technical error; Earth suffer a glacial era and the very few human survivors keep traveling around the world on a train equipped with an eternal engine that generates its own energy and process water and even food.The problem is that the train has different social casts going from the very poor and miserable (freeloaders) to the rich and richer that originally paid for their ticket. When the movie starts (18 years after Earth destruction) the freeloaders are revolting against the fascist regime imposed by train manager and upper classes. The goal is to take over the engine and control the train; which requires crossing all the wagons to reach the first one. Violence will explode to unspeakable levels up to the not surprising but disturbing conclusion.Characters are a little underwritten; however Hurt, Harris and Octavia Spencer are always good without a lot of effort. Chris Evans (the hero with a very dark past) and Jaime Bell (quite believable as an 18 years old) do the best they can. Who really shine are Kang-ho Song (a Korean superstar whose charisma is greater even than Hurt) he barely speaks but his performance is commanding and Swintson in funny caricature of a political (and incompetent functionary ) Clocking two hours and six minutes, the tension becomes addictive. You will be exhausted but never bored. There is no way you can stop looking at it even when what is happening is terrible (lots of blood but extreme things are never shown; just suggested).There are some things I was not convinced; like the train concept; but by the end (without explaining further) are not important.In brief; it is not for everyone and not for kids; but the kind of movie that makes you think.",Snowpiercer
130,witster18,"""Hunger Games"" on a train with a Korean director... that basically sums it up",6,31 October 2014,"Some of the concepts surrounding the train staying on the tracks are more than a bit ridiculous, but the film is entertaining and full of underlying depth. The biggest strength here is the overall 'look' of the film. And there's plenty of action that helps the overlong run-time. The story is still interesting despite it's ridiculous premise, and the director brought aboard some of the neat Korean trademarks; from genre- bending, to dark comedy, to hidden agenda's.I'd like to have had a bit more closure, but like I said, the film is already too long.Ed Harris gets more of a cameo-role in a ""Oz"" from Wizard of Oz-like role, only that scene in particular lacks punch. ANd unfortunately, that's the climax.I can recommend this to fans of fantasy-film, and to fans of the director's work ""The Host"", BUT don't expect anything close to his masterpiece ""Memories of Murder"". I do like the polished refined look of the fantastical aspects of the film.. Obviously, this film had quite a large budget. The set- pieces are very well-done.It's already approaching 7, but could've been an 8 with some train-track idea polishing, and a better ending.You might like this if you liked:The Hunger Games(about even with HG2, and slightly below HG1), Max Max Beyond Thunderdome(not as good as this), or The Host(better).",Snowpiercer

We don't as viewers see how its motion is powered or the tracks it runs on!The plot is basically some 'rebellious' lower class chavs near the back of the train trying to get towards the engine room at the front?The cast is a mixture of Korean (as with many of the crew, English (including John Hurt, Jamie Bell and Tilda Swinton in a weird role as an older English woman)).The train is the brainchild of some rich train loving benefactor/inventor, Wilford who has created this Darwinian ecosystem complete with unnatural selection to control the population of the train and separate its passengers.The film reminded me of a future world like Panem in The Hunger Games trilogy with the social commentary of Netflix film The Platform.For viewers with a more scientific nature the sheer plot holes with the train cannot be forgotten.It's a no from me.",Snowpiercer

And...well, at least 2 characters are in the film. Can't really say about other 5 people who we know nothing about even in the end. It looks like a lot was lost in the adaptation for the screen. I mean, some characters are distinctive enough to be memorable, and they are probably important for the story, but since we have no time for them they just mostly die and we can't care cause we don't know anything about them. It's like they wanted to show all the important characters from the reference material but they had no time for them anyway.This could've worked on a purely thematical level if they would go a little more symbolic on this.Buff the run time a little, make it somewhat more boring, remove the pointless action (leave only the starting one to reference revolution and violence). Make each of the cars count (some of them were significant, like the education part, the aquarium had important dialogue and stuff but the sauna one was just a waste of time). Dwell more on interesting dialogue (which is there), develop the characters, make us care.Instead a miscast Chris Evans embarks on a journey that never really affects him, tells his life story in an expository monologue and ends up taking stupid decisions that lead to horrible consequences. No interesting twists, nothing. The Korean guy barely even talks, the girl is supposed to represent a younger generation but she has nothing to do in this film.I think the above mentioned is the only way this film could've worked. Going grounded and realistic with this can never work, there's just too many plot holes to take.For all the great production design and value, this film ends up being a waste of 2 hours of your time.",Snowpiercer

A rebellion is rising that may determine the fate of everyone on board. There is much potential in the story, yet – alas – the themes are not explored adequately. Depth is lacking in the action sequences and acting as well. The film is based on a graphic novel and it seems to me that the fantastic and surreal themes, merely touched upon in the film, might reach their full potential in this medium rather than what appears on screen.

136,msbreviews,"Snowpiercer is an emotionally shocking, unique piece of cinema!",9,25 May 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Snowpiercer is getting a TV adaptation soon, so now it's the best moment to rewatch one of the best movies in 2014. At the time, Bong Joon-ho wasn't exactly a famous director that everyone knew about. Therefore, the cast led by Captain America himself, Chris Evans, and the intriguing premise did all the work in creating the cult following it got. Ironically, I haven't watched this film since its release, so this is only my second time boarding its train. I'm going to start with the best thing that this movie possesses: its screenplay.This is one of the most shocking films I've seen when it comes to delivering jaw-dropping twists, one after the other, exclusively through dialogue. As it would become a staple in Bong Joon-ho's filmography, his writing is so incredibly complex and multi-layered that it's truly a miracle that his movies end up making any sense. Snowpiercer (which is co-written by Kelly Masterson) has literally dozens of logical questions that any other film would not only fail to explain, they wouldn't even try to. With any other screenwriters, this movie would feel too far-fetched and hard to believe. But it's far from that.Each character receives extraordinarily elaborate development, filled with mind-blowing revelations and eye-opening twists. Every line of dialogue, every picture, every camera movement, every shot, every scene matters. Everything the viewer sees or hears either means something or foreshadows an eventual payoff. Snowpiercer is the definition of ""every shot counts"". Don't you dare go to the bathroom without stopping the film first. You'll undoubtedly miss something significant. Absolutely brilliant screenplay and astonishing, well-written characters.
It's indisputably a narrative-driven story. Snowpiercer is a lesson in exposition. Even though there's plenty of action (I'll get there), it's a movie that relies on the viewer's ability to be captivated by dialogue. The concept is definitely unique, and the story is extremely captivating, but only if the viewer can understand the value of entertainment in listening to these characters while they go through their revolution... in learning who these characters were, are and will be. Just as an example, there's a third act's monologue performed by Chris Evans that not only delivers tons of information about his character, but it's also emotionally compelling to watch. If someone doesn't *feel* anything during this scene, then maybe Snowpiercer might not be the movie for you.I find The Platform to have a similar concept. Instead of a train, it's a vertical prison, but the allegory of how society works is evident in both films. How politics, religion, and early education can control Humanity. The top/front people not only receive more than what they need, but they still overuse everything, completely ignoring the bottom/tail humans that need to fight for scraps. These films take entirely different paths, but Snowpiercer owns a much more complex narrative than The Platform. However, it's still interesting to see the comparisons between these two distinct approaches on a similar theme.Nevertheless, for everyone that needs some sort of dynamic entertainment, this flick is also packed with action set pieces. There's a tiny bit of too much shaky cam for my taste, but overall, it accomplishes the mission of delivering the chaotic, energetic, claustrophobic environment that the action sequences need. It's a train, after all. It's not like they could produce massive battles in such a small space. In fact, the screenplay allows the crew to show some really creative, innovative techniques. The use of slow-motion (not only during the action scenes) elevates the movie, generating great suspense/tension, and it's perfectly timed (including a fantastic one-take sequence with Chris Evans).
Since I just mentioned him, might as well address his impressive performance. People might not remember this, but at the time of the film's release, Evans was interested in pursuing a directing career, setting his acting as a secondary role. While I do believe he's going to make a great director, I'm beyond happy that he continued to use his acting abilities. As with most of MCU's actors, I feel like he's pretty underrated considering what he has demonstrated throughout his career. Snowpiercer is just the tip of the iceberg. Chris Evans is a remarkable actor and much more than ""just"" a version of Captain America.Tilda Swinton (Mason) also offers a quite interesting display, Octavia Spencer (Tanya) is fascinating, while the legend Ed Harris (Wilford) takes his short but effective screentime to prove how gifted he is, especially concerning plot exposition. He's always able to be captivating by merely opening his mouth. Marco Beltrami's score is riveting and memorable. The editing (Steve M. Choe, Changju Kim) is not only seamless, but it definitely helps the viewer better understand the story. Finally, the production and set design are impeccable, offering the ""one-location"", claustrophobic vibe that a train unavoidably has.My only major issue involves the ending. It's quite impactful but also underwhelming and morally divisive. A particular decision that affects everyone in the train (basically, the entire Humanity) doesn't quite convince me that it's the best conclusion. It sort of diminishes some of the characters' efforts to get where they do, as well as the story's initial purpose. On one hand, it's an ending that raises a few questions in a movie that does a terrific job in explaining every little detail until this last moment. On the other hand, the train is far from giving a fair life to everyone...
In the end, Snowpiercer is not only one of 2014's best films but also one of the best of the respective decade. With a brilliant screenplay, Bong Joon-ho delivers an extremely complex narrative, filled with emotionally shocking character development, and featuring excellent stunt work. The underlying theme of how Humanity is controlled by how its society works (from politics to religion to education) cleverly accompanies the already twistful story. Snowpiercer is a phenomenal lesson in ""exposition"", and the definition of ""every shot matters"". Boasting jaw-dropping performances from everyone, especially from Chris Evans, every dialogue is remarkably captivating, packed with mind-blowing revelations, and an unbelievable effort in explaining every little detail regarding the train's functionality. This would undoubtedly be at the top of the decade's best movies if not for a morally divisive and somewhat underwhelming/questionable ending. Technically, an addictive score, amazing editing, and impressive production/set design put the final stamp of quality in a brightly original, unique piece of cinema.Rating: A",Snowpiercer

The dark side of survival.,9,5 April 2014,"The name of this movie actually made me think it had to be some low budget made for TV tripe, but was I ever happily surprised. From the start you get a real sense of desolation, and humanity working together to get by on the scraps that are left. This movie is a bit of an epic journey, as the entire world is now just the people alive on this train, and everything they have is controlled with religious style propaganda, and symbolism. The cast is a fantastic mix with Octavia Spencer﻿ playing once again a completely new character for her, and as usual nailing it. John Hurt and Chris Evans﻿ are the revolutionists continually preparing for battle, and readying to advance on the well fed first class passengers. While the train continues it's once per year non stop trip around the world. Changes are coming, and secrets need to finally see the light of day. I really Enjoyed this movie it is a great take on the Ark (Baxter novel)﻿ type of worst case scenario story, although there are missing pieces that are never explained (Where do all these people live when they are not working or partying? & If you are differing to a translating machine, everyone should be shown as speaking the same language, not different with subs it just feels off.) but in a movie this grand little details can be imagined away. So yes I recommend that everyone see this movie. There really is a lot of heart, and truth that is just pressed up to your face, and that amazing train is like something that Nemo might have envisioned, and the destroyed world of the future looks quite real.",Snowpiercer
138,SoumikBanerjee25,Not On Par with Bong Joon-Ho's Other Works!,6,26 June 2021,"Being another post-apocalyptic feature, Snowpiercer brings forth Political Insinuations, Power Dynamics, and most significantly; socio-economic disparities that are substantially relevant in so many ways! Reminiscent of his other works; Bong Joon-ho yet again sought for figurative interpretation! Although, this time; the Writing falls short of achieving his desired outcome!On top of its tedious pace & shoddy character developments; the biggest complaint that I have is about the lack of clarity in its portrayal! Whereas the identical allegories worked wonders in Parasite; this has not been the case here! The greater implications are vaguely defined and sketchily pointed out.By dint of untidy transcription; the entire narrative feels out of place! For instance, the opening sequence does not look like a fitting introduction nor it connotes any background context. Rather surprising, given the fact the script is written by none other than Bong Joon-ho himself!Thankfully, the Performances compensate for all the apparent drawbacks! Chris Evans as Kurtis exhibits an engrossing display of exhaustive character delineation! Sure enough, it qualifies as one of his career highlights! Speaking of the rest of the ensemble; Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Tilda Swinton, Kang-ho Sang; they too show enough competence in their respective acts.From a technical standpoint, This is gritty, bloody & shockingly barbaric in between times! Doesn't really shy away from Gore & Violence and I suppose that specific characteristic deserves better recognition!So, Do I Recommend This? Well, if you have a taste for Political or Metaphorical representations; Congrats, you came to the right place! Otherwise proceed with caution, as it could get a bit over-complicated!",Snowpiercer
139,ThurstonHunger,"For parent's, not necessarily all aboard....",7,29 December 2014,"Not much of a review here for non-parents. As exciting, dark roller coasters, most people will enjoy this. It was sure a hit among my fellow KFJC dented denizens.Personall I watched this with my twin sixth grade boys over two nights, on the cocoon-tube. A few moments gave me pause, so other Dads (and Moms?) might want to preview the film first. Or read reviews here that give away more, if you flip a coin, I'd say go for it, but make a point of chatting afterwards. Perhaps over some frozen treats (not bars of black jello) Right about where we split the film up (I may waver on Film Ratings but bedtime is a little more strict) was when the film started to fall apart for us. It was devolving into an action adventure, shoot 'em affair. Violence with other humans involved, even in a futuristic frozen allegory, still leaves an accent on the gory. And lessens the value of human life. As one son mentioned, the slow motion fighting scenes tripped an alarm for him.He later went online to see comments about the film being cut, and dumbed down for a US audience, and lamented that fact. He made a comment about enjoying the philosophy more so than the battles (by the way, it looks like he might be wrong and the version we watched was likely the final version).Philosophy was his word, and that might be a little wrong. But there is plenty of social theory on display, and for boys this age, coming out of an era of extreme rights and wrongs in elementary school, into the more gray area of middle school, where sub rosa politics is both invisible and invincible, I do think this film is timed well for 6th through 8th graders. Bullets are not the only thing that lessen human life.Anyways, I sort of agreed with him, but now I wonder if most revolutions and up being a lot stronger in the planning, the covert against-the-odds contemplation than in the roll out the rifle stages. We all sort of felt where the train was headed, without launching a spoiler.The aspect of addiction was interesting in how it was presented (another boy, a friend of ours, had seen this film and I remember that he offered us a warning about it). Meanwhile, one of my boys, for a while, was saying ""Kronole"" every time I asked him to do something. Fortunately, he kicked that habit.The film started out on track for an 8, and veered towards a 6 by the end. Perhaps the most gruesome scene is delivered only in discussion, again I don't want to drop a spoiler as it comes towards the end.My boys chatted about that and other aspects of the film, and I'd strongly recommend that for other parents. As enjoyable and more meaningful than the movie for us, and we didn't bog down on plot holes. One of the amazing things to watch your kids while watching the film is when the rebels first break through into shall we say the garden of the 1%?

140,Imdbidia,"Great production and acting, but disappointing",7,24 February 2017,"I was really looking forward to watching this first-English movie by Hoon Ho. Based on the the French graphic novel Transperceneige, Snowpierced is a mix of modern Noah's Ark, post-apocalyptic adventure, and a allegorical reflection of the world order we live in, full of social differences, and where the rich parts of the world exploit others who are hungry and impoverished. The story also presents an ethical query on the validity of uprising, or climbing the ladder, without knowing what you want, where you are heading, and what's the purpose of your actions. In a way, and very subtly, the script questions the validity of revolution as a freer of the individual, as puts revolutionaries and tyrants on similar levels of violence and brutality and part of the same vicious circle that leads nowhere. I found the movie entertaining overall, but also full of deja-vu themes and ideas, with a somewhat predictable ending, too many goofs and editorial left-overs not to be noticed, and an overall lack of purpose and deepening into the main themes of the film. On the other hand, I will remember this first English-feature film by Joon-Ho because of its wonderful cinematography, production and, above all, the work of all actors.To be fair, all actors are good or very good in this film. Not just the big stars, but most of the supporting actors, as well. However, Tilda Swinton steals the show and is almost unrecognizable and absolutely brilliant as the repulsive pathetic old English bully Mason, as if Swinton had been swallowed by Mason, so good and credible she is. The second is Chris Evans, an actor whom I have never paid much attention to as he's always involved in unsubstantial super-heroes films; however, he's truly convincing and great as Curtis, in his best performance so far. Perhaps the most disappointing actor was Ed Harris,who seems locked in a pseudo-Truman-Show role once again.The cinematography is excellent both in the depiction of the interiors and the imagery of the frozen cities and snowy mountain exteriors. I especially liked the play with the focus on the faces of Curtis and Wildford almost at the end of the film; very cool.The production, lighting, wardrobe, and the overall design are superb. There is great imagination, and also humour, in the way the miniaturized recreation of a whole society in the different train carriages. Some images are just difficult to forget, like the carriage with the garden, or the aquarium, the schoolroom and the 'sweet' mistress, among many others. Some of the fights are really entertaining, and one in particular reminded me of one of the classic 70's James Bond's villain-hero fights, the one in which the head psychopathic security guard fights with the advancing insurgents.To me, the main disappointment is this -- if you hint that are you are going to serve wagyu beef on the plate and I get a steak of tofu, I am going to resent it. That is, if you promise to dig on ethical and philosophical issues and you don't dig into any of those, I will be annoyed, and I was.The amount of goofs, lacunae, and holes is so noticeable that one cannot pretend they aren't there. In general, one can expect and accept a certain number of goofs in any movie as they will pass unnoticed, because the brain somewhat absorbs them and integrates them in the story. However, this is not the case here. I blame the editor, because those twigs that seems to relate to something that is never presented or commented upon before or afterwards could have been eliminated, and the film would have been more polished and credible. At the same time, I expect the script to explain how things apparently impossible are possible, or at least to hint it by creating a story that does the trick. But I never got an answer to those. For example, how would you feed and water livestock on a train? Overall, the movie is entertaining and has many good things but, because it's a Joon-ho's, I expected more Wagyu and less tofu, more substance that flash.PS-No negative vote is going to change how I see things :)",Snowpiercer

142,Laakbaar,Wow! And...really?,8,17 April 2014,"This movie is set in a future post-apocalyptic world, where the remnants of humanity (perhaps a few hundred people) have spent almost two decades on a massive, advanced supertrain. The train is self-sufficient and has its own perpetual power generator so it is able to continue navigating a dead, frozen, ice-covered world. The train has two or three classes, with heavy security dividing them.The plot is based on the steerage class passengers who (living with squalor, misery and repression) try to push their way to the front to take control from the mysterious conductor ""Wilford"". Part of the fun is seeing what happens to people when trapped on a train for 17 years. As you can imagine, everyone on the train is either crazy or half crazy.This movie does not require you to suspend your disbelief; it requires you to axe all its limbs off and then spear it to death. Really, the director expects us to swallow the scenario of someone in one train car being able to shoot a man about 800 metres away in another train car while in a standing position on a moving train with two bullet-proof window panes in between. And almost hitting him. (Where would someone in that situation have gotten the target practice?) Without going into too much other detail, quite a few scenes in the film are unbelievable or inexplicable given the plot scenario, and more questions arise with every scene.If you hope to enjoy this movie, you have to turn off your logic centre and stop asking yourself questions. (But But But) I kept thinking of ways to explain things.* ""I know, this is a metaphor for earth hurtling through the frozen void"". * ""I know, he's a robot."" * ""I know, it's like Soylent Green. They eat the children."" * ""But where do they sleep?"" * ""I know, there is no Wilford and the whole thing is being directed by an amoral computer"") I'm afraid this movie is simply not subject to that kind of rational analysis.Did I mention that it's a violent film? Mostly of the cartoon variety, fortunately.However, despite all this, it's actually a pretty entertaining film. Right from the start, I was very curious to see what was in the front of the train. Curtis (Chris Evans) emerged as the leader of the group. This kind of role suits Chris Evans. (I hate Captain America, but I seem to like Chris Evans in everything else. He's one of the few actors out there whom I would be interested in meeting.) Tilda Swinton blew me away as the over-the-top, half-demented, sadistic ""cruise"" director.I'm unsure how to rate this film. I feel that I want to give it an 8 because of its originality, execution and sheer enjoyment factor, but I also feel a little manipulated by the contrivances in the movie. Also, I was not moved at all. I suppose I'll give it a 7 for now, but I may raise this later.EDIT: I've just seen this movie a second time, and it is indeed worth an 8.",Snowpiercer
143,ronakkotian,A great premise that gets overshadowed by its flaws.,7,28 April 2020,"After Parasite, I decided to revisit another Bong Joon-Ho film which I really liked the first time I saw it. Upon viewing it a second time, it still holds up but not as well as before.Snowpiercer shows us a post-apocalyptic world where the last remaining humans are surviving on a train known as the Snowpiercer. The people at the back of the train become frustrated with their lifestyle, leading them on a violent journey to the front of the train.The concept is very interesting and the film has a lot of meaning which will stick with you after the film's ending. However, another part of the film which will stick with you is its many plot holes. A lot of this film is done well. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and change in environment within each of the train's carriages makes the exploration of the train even more intriguing. A lot of the action scenes were well shot even though there were times where the camera would get too shaky.The pacing was also great. There is not a single dull moment whatsoever which is due to the fantastic performances by everyone especially Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton. What I love about this film the most is what it's trying to say. Much like Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho once again focuses on the theme of class warfare and social inequality. The use of colour highlights this issue really well. The back of the train has a very dark and murky feel to it in contrast to the front which seems way more luxurious. The theme of class disparity makes Snowpiercer really thought-provoking and one that ought to be discussed amongst viewers.Whilst the concept is refreshing, on my second watch I couldn't help but notice the various plot holes within the story. Quite a fair bit of this film doesn't make much sense and it's this aspect which will overshadow everything else that's great about the film.Snowpiercer is a very interesting film. Its refreshing concept, social commentary, production design and acting are what make it good. If only the execution of the idea was more well thought out, then it would have been a fantastic piece of cinema.",Snowpiercer
144,billygoat1071,Exploring Humanity,9,29 January 2014,"We are recently getting blockbusters that tries to make allegories out of Sci-Fi high concepts about society's lack of equality between rich and poor. Not all of them worked since most of them just used the subject as a petty background and lets the technical wizardry do much of the work, which ends with a silly insincere sentiment. Snowpiercer might do the same as 2013's Elysium or Upside Down did, but this is an ambitious picture that takes the idea seriously. It doesn't let the special effects or the action take over the experience and instead gives away the pain and humanity of the world's living dystopia. Snowpiercer is often cold (no pun intended) and satirical, yet downright affecting with lots of intriguing ideas wandered around.It may feature a train and it is mainly about a revolution attacking against law enforcers and powerful men, but the scenes when it focuses on the characters are actually the greatest strength here. While it acknowledges their suffering and longing, it takes a lot of time to express about what they've been through. And those small scenes of humanity simply makes it remarkable. The film benefits by its actors. Chris Evans is always a great leading hero, and he brings enough impact to the character Curtis. His co-stars, such as Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, and Kang-ho Song, also bring lively personalities on their roles. And much energetic and fun performance from Tilda Swinton as the maniacal villain.It becomes a little bit clunky when it hits to the middle act. This is when the characters are just passing through from room to room. Once again, the titular world of a concept didn't get a deep exposition despite of its intriguing features and interesting caricatured social commentaries. At least the production made the internal Snowpiercer train look fascinating. The action scenes are fine, if not messy. There are inventive battle scenes to be found here and there. However the direction's best way to deliver tension is by taking time to breathe in its dark moments of upcoming merciless violence; easily better than the knife wielding, bullets flying battles. The special effects are cool (no pun intended) enough to keep things large and stunning.Snowpiercer is honestly a fresh experience for a Sci-Fi blockbuster. The genre tends to just blow things up, but here it rather brings more soul than extreme panache. The film looks really good, but there are more interesting things to think about other than the technical stuff. The contents and the themes are the core here, if only they could explore more of the train, but for now the characters' feelings is the epic ride, fighting off the dark side of humanity. Despite of some missed opportunities, its rare quality is already enough to make it recommendable. Because there are bigger things in movies than just visual effects.",Snowpiercer
145,rubenm,"Enjoyable, if you forget all inconsistencies",6,12 April 2014,"Mankind's attempts to control global warming have gone wrong, and as a result humanity has frozen to death. The only survivors of this ecological disaster are located on a rapidly moving train, which has been riding on an endless track for 18 years. The mere fact that in a world without any human life a train can keep on going for years, is just one of the many illogical and unbelievable things you have to put up with while watching this movie. There are so many inconsistencies, it's best to just forget them and concentrate on other aspects of this film. It helps to remember that 'Snowpiercer' is based on a comic book. If you stop trying to look for explanations for everything you see, there is much to enjoy. First of all the action scenes. Korean director Joon-ho Bong films them in a very visual, aesthetic style. A cinematographic highlight is a slow motion scene of a bloody fight with axes. The film is basically the story of a revolution. The passengers in the back of the train, who are brutally oppressed and exploited by the ones in the front part, decide to take over the power. They fight their way forward, car by car, until they reach the engine where the ruler of the train lives a life of luxury. Regularly, they have to fight and kill soldiers, armed guards and other opponents. In their journey forward through the train, they discover all sorts of cars. One is filled with an orange grove, another with a giant aquarium which provides the population of the front cars with fish for sushi. One of the highlights of the film is a scene in a school car, where children are brainwashed to worship the leader in the engine. The cozy, brightly coloured classroom soon transforms into the backdrop for a new violent battle. The first part of the film is definitely the best. The dark, grim scenes in the cramped, filthy back of the train, the first fights with the ruling classes, the surprises when the revolutionists move forward and find more and more luxury in the front parts of the train, are very entertaining and original. But towards the end the movie starts to drag, and the last scenes of long monologues in the engine are rather boring and pompous. One last thing: I wasn't impressed by most of the acting, apart from Tilda Swintons part. I didn't recognize her and only when I saw the end credits realized it was her. She plays a wonderful, crazy, over-the-top character. It's hard to imagine this is the same woman who recently played an elderly aristocratic lady in The Grand Budapest Hotel, or an unhappy Italian mother in Io Sono l'Amore. Which is once again proof of her extraordinary talent.",Snowpiercer
146,RevRonster,A dark and strange (but wonderful) ride...,10,30 July 2014,"I accidentally became aware of this film after checking out John Hurt's list of works right here on IMDb. The title captivated me and I checked out the synopsis and knew I had to see it. I didn't even bother looking at the trailerand it was epic! First off, even though the cast is small, it is made up of really talented actors who are all doing an awe-inspiring job and are all playing very interesting characters. Chris Evans continues to prove he's come a long way since ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and is just fantastic in his portrayal of Curtis, the man who leads the charge on the train and is clearly holding on to some past pain that he can't get over and I was absolutely enthralled with Tilda Swinton's performance as the character Mason. Literally every actor, whether it be Jamie Bell as Curtis' second-in-command, John Hurt as the quiet Gilliam, Octavia Spencer as the grief-stricken but extremely ticked off soldier in Curtis' poor, caboose-end army or even Ed Harris as the man who made the train possible and the object of the lower class' ire and the point of their revolt, did their job fantastically and took the already interesting characters and made them even more engrossing to watch.The other thing that I really enjoyed about the film was how it was both really dark, upsetting, and depressing but, at times, completely absurd and strange to the point that I questioned if there was a gas leak and I was currently hallucinating—okay, that might have been a tad far but there were times when the film gets downright odd and, occasionally, silly. While, at first, it may seem like a direct contradiction to the downtrodden feel that Curtis and his troops are going through as they rise up against the upper class that has left them to die in their own filth in the back of the train, in the end it really helped give a sense of detachment and helped create the foreign feeling that these people from the tail end of the train must be feeling when they find themselves in this new locale. While it helped to break up the dark times with some unusual humor, it also helped to complete engross myself in Curtis' journey through the train.""Snowpiercer,"" at first, can seem like the run-of-the-mill dystopian future film where the ones who are tired of the Haves treating them like garbage decide to rise up and bring about a new regime—and it is totally that. However, director Joon-ho Bong brought a film that had tremendous action, a new surprise around every corner, an addicting story, and characters that were easy to invest in and cheer for their survival (or plead for their demise—depends on which character we're talking about). It was addicting from beginning to end and leaves you with a bittersweet ending. Great film! Greetings, friend!

147,andrewroy-04316,"Snowpiercer is most notable for its pointed and accessible commentary on class and capitalism, but the directness of the ideas leaves little room for nuanced exploration",7,30 March 2020,"Snowpiercer demonstrates excellent visual storytelling, but once you get past the wild premise (for better or worse), it's a film driven by class divide, as shown in an unambiguous analogy in the film. I mostly like the premise - people can whine about it being unrealistic or having plot holes, and that's fair, there were times I couldn't shake nagging questions about how the train was the only thing that kept people alive or how it was really sustainable. Bong at least gives some answers and explanations, enough that I was willing to suspend my disbelief and go with the premise. And when you take his premise at face value, it's a fascinating one - if everyone left was stuck on a train, separated into classes, how would society develop? The game of resistance movements and violence seen early on seems like classic dystopian fare. Once they start moving up the train, culminating in the meeting with Wilford, both class disparities and Wilford's role in the low class revolutions are revealed. Song Kang-Ho's character was interesting, and Evans was excellent as a leader and reasonable mind amid the wild ideologies present on the train. Most of the other supporting characters didn't do much for me, especially Edgar and Tilda Swinton's character. The ending drives home Bong's point, but also leaves little room for interpretation or nuance. As Wilford and Curtis' final conversation shows, the class system of the train could only perpetuate itself forever - within the confines of the train, reform was hopeless. While abandoning the system is scary and dangerous, it was arguably necessary and shows a hopeful ending where maybe humans could live in the world again. I love the visuals and appreciate the direct and accessible themes, but it's a double edged sword where I'm not left thinking about it days later.",Snowpiercer

149,bregund,"Interesting until the end, Tilda is the main reason for watching",7,12 August 2015,"If you liked Brazil, you'll like this film. The concept of a train running a continuous loop may seem pointless, but as with all good dystopic visions of the future, the film actually makes fun of the idea so you don't even have to buy into it; the characters themselves have a hard time with it. In a time when any poor kid can grow up to become a billionaire, it may be hard to grasp the idea of a heavily structured, class-based society, but obsession with this idea shows no signs of stopping, if the popularity of the hunger games is any indicator. You'll have to suspend some disbelief; how a small child can power an entire train requires a strong suspension of disbelief. The acting is good all around, but it's absolutely delightful to watch Tilda Swinton enter the room, with the all the shrill, insufferable arrogance of a mid-level manager; we all have a Mason in our lives.The ending sort of falls apart, leaving you questioning what it was all for. Polar bears don't climb mountains. Those kids are as good as dead. Sort of a downer, you know.",Snowpiercer
150,bbickley13-921-58664,It was a great movie to watch,7,28 June 2014,"I'm really a fan of confined Sci-fi movies and it does not get more confined than being stuck on a train for seventeen years because the human race messed up the Eco system and forced an Ice age that no life could sustain in, but on this long ass train that travels around the world. On the anniversary of the train's creation, Captain America's Chris Evans leads the people on the bottom of the food chain who dwell at the tail end of train, to the very front where the Engine is located so they can take it over in hopes of a better life.The post Apocalyptic future gives us an extreme version of how Society is right now with classes being separated by Train cars. This ideal was also help by the Art direction, which use mostly color and light to show how different the class cars where. The violence was very glorified to the point of being very beautiful, but there is a purpose to the violence, painting a perfect picture of the struggle and their uprising.It was a great Sci-fi story as well that points out many grim realities about the idea that the last of the human populace is located only on the train and what needs to be done in order to function. Reminds me of the Matrix reloaded.Chris Evans acts more like Wolverine than Cap in this one, playing an anti-hero who wants to do the right thing by his people but does not want to be the leader he's born to be because of a shady past that most of his idealizers, like his second in command, Edger don't know about.Academy award winner Octiva Spencer is in the movie playing Tanya, who joins Chris Evan's character, Curtis as he heads for the engine, with her primary agenda to get back her 5 year old son who was taken by the Wealthy train riders for an unknown reason. I like her addiction to the movie as she played a woman who was normal and unspectacular who has to step up to the plate, which was a little more real than Chris Evans role. She was one of a few spectacular characters backing up Evans in the flick.Overall this movie was a stunning Sci-fi masterwork, worth the watch.",Snowpiercer
151,PyroSikTh,I Waited Six Years for This to Reach My Country...,9,17 January 2019,"Snowpiercer is the first English-language movie by Korean filmmaker Joon-ho Bong (who has since managed to get Okja distributed via Netflix), without losing his Korean sensibilities. We follow Curtis, a lower-class passenger at the back of a train that defies the frozen apocalypse outside. Guided by his mentor Gilliam, and helped by his younger friend Edgar, he plots and stages a revolt against the upper classes, gradually working his way through the breadth of the train, tail to head. His aim is to reach the ""Sacred Engine"" that has kept the train running for over seventeen years, and confront its creator, and mastermind of the train's closed ecosystem, Wilford.If this concept seems too preposterous to get passed, you can stop reading now and get on with your life. Snowpiercer does not prioritise realism, plotting, or sense, and it's arguably a better movie for it. Instead it takes the setting as it is, explains only what is relevant to the story, and presents us a post-apocalyptic social satire on global warming, class systems, and the logical fallacies of society. The movie opens in the dark and dingy tail-end of the train. Curtis and his fellow low-lifes are abused and quashed at every opportunity, suffer semi-regular abductions without explanation, and are fed exclusively on mysterious protein jelly slabs. As the movie progresses, and the revolt steadily builds its stride, the dark, grimy, foreboding tone and setting makes way to brighter, more colourful carriages, filled with eclectic members of higher society, and odd juxtapositions between the two worlds smashed together.A couple of scenes to note include the axe fight, from beginning to end, opening with the upper classes bloodying their weapons with a fish carcass, and ending in pitch-blackness lit by firelight, with a New Years interlude in the middle reminiscent of the Christmas Truce in World War I, where the British and the Germans momentarily stopped fighting to play a game of football in the middle of no-man's land. It's odd, jarring, and yet poignant and makes the train feel human and lived in. Another scene is in a brightly coloured school carriage, where the kids are indoctrinated with propaganda from an overly friendly, pregnant teacher, complete with a happy-sounding song with somewhat dark lyrics, and sudden shifts in tone all over the place. Then there's Curtis' monologue near the end where he tells Nam what happened when he first came onto the train as a teenager, and the dark depths he found himself in just trying to survive.I'll admit, like many people I found the ending a little preposterous, but it didn't take me long to realise that was kind of the entire point. Was humanity worth saving after all they had done, and still continued to do to one another? Is it really a bad thing the lines between hero and villain were blurred unrecognisably? Is the final scene meant to be one of hope or despair, or maybe a bittersweet omen? I came to the conclusion that the film was all the better for not answering these questions, and instead opting for a closer that ignites discussion and dissection.Chris Evans was absolutely fantastic as Curtis, and it was really nice to see him as someone other than Captain America again. His performance here made me really look forward to the next couple of years in his career as he takes his leap away from the MCU, and is allowed to make more interesting career choices. His monologue at the end wouldn't have been half as compelling without his telling of it, and the stern, resistant leader role suited him well as a juxtaposition to his role in the MCU. John Hurt did his best John Hurt, which is always a win. Jamie Bell provided a great catalyst and accompaniment to Chris Evans, while Octavia Spencer and Ewen Bremner were compelling in their small supporting roles. If I had to give it to someone though, it would either be Tilda Swinton who is evidently having a lot of fun as the ever-swinging Minister Mason, or Ko Asung as the maybe-future-sighted Yona, who proves to be of more use to Curtis than he initially thought.Snowpiercer is a fantastic piece of filmmaking that breaks genre boundaries, and provides a wider English-speaking audience with a foreign stylistic approach. It doesn't care for the plotholes that are created, and neither should you. Let it take you along for the ride and get enveloped in its high-concept satire, and it will surprise you at every turn, through every carriage. I give Snowpiercer a (potentially generous) 9/10! Come on powers-that-be, give us a nice home video release so I can put it on my shelf and watch it whenever I want!",Snowpiercer
152,CinematicInceptions,Solid dystopian film with some great action and themes.,7,28 February 2016,"There might be some things that are annoying about this movie, but it's still probably worth your time to watch it. There are no new dystopian future elements introduced, but it doesn't feel like it's copying any pre-existing dystopian material. But, like all futuristic stories, it has pertinence to today's world; in this case, our present society tries to counteract global warming but we overdo it and end up freezing the earth solid. There is also a social critique of the class system, which seems a little bit polarized and unrealistic, but there is definitely some relevant truth to it. The middle and upper classes only keep the poor ones around because they need them. Without giving spoilers, this subplot works very well with the choice of using a train as the mode of transportation.The characters are fairly prominent, but not to the extent that their own problems detract from the social/political conflict as in Hunger Games or Divergent. They are developed well enough that we care about or like them, but not enough that we have empathy for them. Curtis, the protagonist and leader, is kind of an Everyman character, but he is genuinely driven and has enough distinctive qualities that he doesn't feel generic. Gilliam is clearly a strong influence in Curtis' beliefs and , but this is implied more than shown. Edgar is something like Curtis' second, and is a very zealous and impatient young man that has a tendency to be annoying, but is still useful. There are a number of minor characters among the other back passengers, the most prominent being Tanya whose five-year-old is brought up to the front. Two of the most important characters are Namgoong Minsoo and his daughter Yona, but I'm not going to go into detail about them for spoiler purposes. Our two villains are Wilford and his messenger, Mason. Wilford is more of a name than anything else, much like Big Brother, and a lot can be said about him based on his being the creator of the train. The fact that he had the foresight to create a train that thrived in cold conditions shows that he knew what was going to happen and chose not to stop it. He probably also had no small hand in choosing who was allowed onto the train, not to mention how it was divided by social classes. Mason is more than the obedient worker; she believes in the class structure and everything that Wilford stands for as if it is a religion.Some of the dialogue was not very impressive, but this was an inconsistent problem. I really only had a problem with lines from Edgar, Wilford, and Mason. Some of that might have been the fault of their delivery from the actors, but it wasn't severe enough to make the performances or the screenplay bad. I also felt like the New Year's countdown right before commencing battle was uncalled for. It really detracted from the mood of that scene and didn't contribute to any of the themes. The action choreography wasn't amazing, but it was pretty stylized and engaging and it wasn't mindless.The most prominent aspect of the execution was the camera-work. Honestly, this is one of the best-shot movies I think I've ever seen. The contrast of color between the back and front was striking. Mason stands out severely when she visits the back, and the back passengers' dinginess is similarly contrasting to the colorful environment of the front. The two best shots of the movie in my opinion were the prolonged shot of the snowflake and the split-second shot of the swinging hammer near the beginning.There is action throughout, but it doesn't feel action driven. If anything, there was probably an implausibly small amount of resistance the back passengers meet. Also, I can assure you that invincibility mode is off in all of these action scenes. If you don't like action driven movies, this is maybe worth a second look because there are a lot of good themes if you like that but it still may not be enjoyable to you. On a final note, the trailers are pretty honest and should not disappoint. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",Snowpiercer

This train has been running for years, and it has its own microcosm of social classes, with the rich and powerful living in the front in luxury, and all the poor and wretched stuck in the back. When those in the back of the train stage a revolution to take over the front, all hell breaks loose.That's pretty much what this film entails: the prologue is brief, setting the stage immediately for an all-out onslaught of bloody fighting, riveting peril, and startling revelations. It's a rather grim and bleak film that doesn't shy away from the grisly details, but it's rarely trashy or distasteful. The film is dark, fast-moving, and action-packed. I personally couldn't ask for a more entertaining picture.What's even more rewarding is the storytelling. It's a bit of a weird and unbelievable yarn, thinking that a single train could run endlessly like this. There are bound to be plot holes to uncover if you really analyze it on the surface level. However, the film slowly unveils more and more details behind its concept that gives more background (whether it's plausible or not is probably debatable). Above all, the film takes itself seriously, everything looks creditable, and it provides a self-contained world that's easy to take on its own merits. In spite of all this, the plot moves fast and reaches an interesting climax (the likes of which would be on-par with the architect scene of The Matrix Reloaded, minus the mumbo-jumbo, but with the same level of plot twisting). Characters aren't terribly deep or refined; they ultimately serve little more than voices for the issues, plot complications, and conflicts that erupt.The biggest asset to this film are its themes. Some folks won't like them, because it's a very blatant, in-your-face allegory concerning the state of the world we currently live in. The film asserts that we are all headed toward disaster if we continue to run this ""train"" of ours the way we have been. Whether you look at it as a criticism of the upper class exploiting the lower class, or the depletion of the environment and resources, the film paints a bleak picture to expose the ugly truths of our cold world. I find the parallels compelling, although I'm sure there are those who will find them pretentious, obnoxious, stupid, or something else.Regardless of how you grade the content, the film looks great with its dark and gritty photography. Editing is top-notch. Acting is great: Chris Evans is surprisingly somber as the protagonist, and I enjoyed the performances by John Hurt, Ed Harris, Song Kang-ho, and Go Ah-sung. Tilda Swinton is awesomely hammy in her role. Every other actor pulls their weight really well. Writing is pretty sharp and good. This production has great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects tend to look fake, but it rarely detracts from the film's overall quality. Music is decently somber too.Snowpiercer is a rather odd tale, but one that is highly imaginative, consistently entertaining, and it's chock full of themes worth exploring (whether you want to or not). Highly recommended! 5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Content: Good | Film: Perfect)",Snowpiercer
156,rocknrelics,Laughable popcorn,3,18 July 2020,"If you can suspend your disbelief for a second you might enjoy this as a no brain piece of popcorn, but the problem is, the whole set up is completely unbelievable!I wouldn't know where to begin pointing out the plot holes, but they're not hard to spot,theres that many.The acting is second rate too, how John Hurt let himself be involved with this is beyond me.Was looking forward it seeing this, but it was a complete letdown.",Snowpiercer
157,estreet-eva,So...just scrap the whole system and let everyone die?,5,12 November 2014,"But wait, who maintained the tracks?OK, now that is out of the way, the Korean / American science fiction allegory ""Snowpiercer"" takes on societal inequality by reducing the now frozen world to a single train making year-long trips around the global. Third world denizens ride in the chaotic, cannibalistic back and first world denizens (who presumably continue to write movie reviews on the web) luxuriate in the front where the party (at least in one car) literally never ends. Joon-Ho Bong populates each train car with another, trippy, corner of society producing an Hayao Miyazaki-like dreamy, surreal feeling...at least until the bullets start to fly and it turns back into an action- adventure outing. The baddies ordering the shooting include a by- the-numbers Ed Harris and the always incomparable Tilda Swinton as every unpleasant, misguided, mid-level bureaucrat bully you've ever had to deal with. She all but shouts the old Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" line: ""how can you have your pudding when you didn't eat your meat."" Otherwise hero Chris Evans looks like a crazy person and is hard to cozy up to as are the filth-covered tail-enders who represent the poor, oppressed and therefore heroic goodies. As allegory the film works well although one struggles with just exactly who Wilford represents? Does he represent all industrialists? He kidnaps the kids and initially leaves the tail- dwellers to starve but in a larger sense, he is kind of keeping all humanity alive isn't he? And speaking of problems with the film's message, not giving away any spoilers but is the movie suggesting that scrapping a corrupt system and letting everyone (including the fish and the folks in the tail) die is the best solution? In short, like the final episode of the television series lost taught us: if you didn't understand it maybe it just wasn't that good.",Snowpiercer
158,ethanbresnett,A very imaginative and entertaining look at a near future apocalyptic world,8,29 December 2020,"Snowpiercer creates a thoroughly intriguing near future world, dominated by the familiar class struggles and inequality that dominate the world today.After some initial exposition courtesy of text over a black screen, we are thrown into the world that Bong Joon Ho has created, and it is a world that is so rich in detail. The train feels very lived in and authentic, and the lore and background of the characters and the situation are explored sufficiently, but not in a clunky or forced way.The story benefits from an inherent simplicity - one man's struggle to rally those living at the tail end of the train and work their way to the front to control the engine. Beneath this simplicity are some great sub plots, and a myriad of interesting characters. I loved Tilda Swinton's in particular, and Chris Evans' character was also very well crafted. It's always nice seeing him out of his Captain America clobber and getting his teeth into something else, and he shines in this film with a gritty and tortured performance.The film has a hurtling pace, with an action packed middle section featuring some exceptional set pieces. The style and direction of these action pieces was fantastic, and are a real highlight of the film. It was maybe 10-15 minutes too long and lost momentum toward the end, but that's getting into nit picking territory.My biggest concern going into this film was that it may be a bit bland visually, with all of the action confined to the one train. However the space is used very well, and the set design was exceptional, creating some very sharp and engaging visuals and some extraordinary shots.Snowpiercer is a must for lovers of post apocalyptic worlds and action films. It ticks all the boxes for me and was a very entertaining watch.",Snowpiercer
159,donaldricco,"Control the engine, control the world!",7,7 July 2020,"Tilda Swinton's character is like a female Donald Trump! Even her speech about hats and shoes seems right out of his insane ravings! And she does it well! As does John Hurt with his character and Ed Harris with his! And that speech outside of the last gate, just wow. Brutal. The movie itself is right up my alley - poor vs. rich, this time, on a train. The concept is pretty well thought out, and the way the train is divided is amazing! But the movie drags a bit after the mid point, and I'm not a fan of how it ended. Still, the overall message is what appeals to me, especially living in the times that we are in now. Way too many Masons, not enough Curtis'...",Snowpiercer
160,blackmamba99971,A future that could happen,10,16 April 2014,"I found this film to be very enjoyable. A train made to circumnavigate the globe after a failed attempt to reestablish temperatures for earth's climate. A chemical that was used to help drop the heavy warm weather back so that it could propagate cooler streams did not stop as it should have resulting in a new ice age.Everything on the planet was killed... Plants, humans, fish, and even land dwelling animals except the polar bears. The train itself was a kind of Noah's ark to keep a certain number of humans along with hydroponic sections, along with an aquarium to feed those elite who stayed in the front section of the train while all the poor had to eat crushed insects made to look like jellied protein bars.Then a man (Chris Evans) led a revolt to the front so he can find answers as to why his people were being either killed, or taken prisoner with no explanation. Strange questions led one after another as he found out later that the train was a self sustained module in order to keep running forever. Yet as with all machines it tends to break down at the part levels.This is where kids came into the picture. I liked the way the story evolved in one way or another to present new secrets. And the trains engineer (Ed Harris) to explain why the revolt was staged by him, and his good friend Gilliam (John Hurt). A very plausible sense of our futures that hang in the balance. What would happen if? That is the question. The moral implications as well as the dastardly plots by the elite will never go away. That the rich will always keep the down trodden lower than the dirt. So that the y can keep themselves in comfort as long as the will to crush the necks of slaves is still within their grasp. I found the music appealing as well as the character cast including both the father Steve (Steve Park) and his daughter Yona (Ah-Sung Ko)as the support in the plan to take over the train.What was mind bending enough though is how the train stayed on the tracks as they plow through the snowdrifts leading to a long tunnel where Curtis (Chris Evans) Fought off some rather scary looking hatchet wielding psychos. Physics can never be broken. But in this film it was well thought out. I highly recommend this to those over 17... lots of action, good humor in small parts, and very implicit moral issues.",Snowpiercer
161,rajatdahiyax,A solid movie yet not satisfying!!!!,6,21 August 2015,"Snowpiercer is a 2013 South Korean science fiction action film based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob and Jean- Marc Rochette. The film is directed by Bong Joon-ho, and written by Bong and Kelly Masterson. The film stars Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, John Hurt, and Ed Harris. The movie takes place aboard the globe-spanning Snowpiercer train which holds the last remnants of humanity after a manufactured attempt to stop global warming created a new ice age. Evans stars as Curtis Everett, a member of the lower-class tail section passengers as they lead a revolution against the elite of the front of the train.",Snowpiercer
162,TaylorYee94,One of the movies that friends can talk about for hours after the movie,7,22 March 2021,"Whether you like the movie or not, it lets audience contemplate on many topics. I watched with one of my friends, and we debated about the movie's quality and discussed about how 'Snowpiercer' portrays the society.I see many reviews complaining about the ending, but in my opinion, it is the ending that can happen only in the movie, giving the most hope for the remaining two (Yona and Timmy). In real life, complete reconstruction of one society never happens because shifting the whole paradigm requires so much energy just like bombing the thickest gate in the train. Sometimes coup and revolution succeeds, relocating the head the tail, or the tail who works hard and dirty to get to the top becomes the head itself. However, the director is smart and creative enough to change the vertical and linear journey from the tail to the engine to the whole new dimension and universe, taking us outside of the train at the ending. I understand people's disappointment though because what they have pursued as the 'goal' or the 'end' for an hour and a half becomes not that important. I am rather disappointed at the pace of the story not the ending. The first half of the movie is slow paced, a little boring and stretched while the last half of the movie hastefully rushes to the closing, creating a leap of logic. For example, Yona suddenly decides to lift up the floor tile to tell the audience where kids work OUT OF NOWHERE. Wilford explains the whole concept of the train and its analogy to the society so tightly in very short time.The movie succeeds in describing our society with honesty to the level of blatancy and inhumanity. Economic bottom suffers the pain equivalent to cutting of own arm in our everyday lives. Politicians and capitalists do their best to keep the status quo in more delicate and tender way than Wilford's. What Wilford says must be disgusting but it can also be true. The head wants to regulate how the resources are distributed and one's position in the society. It can be hurtful, painful, and unjustifiable if you are at the tail section, but what if you are one of the first class passenger? Don't you want to help Wilford to keep the way things are like Minister Mason or Teacher? The deeper I dig in with the questions like this, the more inhumane I feel.",Snowpiercer

164,david-meldrum,Well Worth Your Time,8,26 July 2019,"A tautly directed, technically dazzling post-apocalyptic film, with a host of familiar names - which leaves in doubt right until the end who survives and who dies. The technical brilliance is in direction and cinematography, making the best use of confined spaces and what I assume was a limited budget. It's also part social commentary - climate change and ecology, social structures, and what is presented as the fundamental darkness of the human condition. Don't let that make it sound as if it's a bleak or boring film - the two hours zips by, there are engaging flashes of humour and moments of real beauty amidst the bloodshed. Well worth seeking out.",Snowpiercer
165,samkan,"Mild Fun, NOT Science Fiction",5,11 July 2014,"Think HUNGER GAMES cranked up a notch with violence. Like HUNGER GAMES and the dozens of other post-apocalyptic special effects extravaganzas this movie (if occasionally enjoyable when Tilda Swinton and Alison Pill appear) is pure fantasy. There's nothing wrong enjoying a silly diversion like SNOWPIERCER or its ilk, though like fast food and self-abuse one feels kind of dumb afterwards and an hour later has fully forgotten the experience. Contrast such to a great book or film that lingers with the reader and/or film-goer for sometimes substantial periods. And S-P'r is no more science fiction than LORD OF THE RINGS but is rather fable and fantasy set in the future as opposed to the distant past. Genuine science fiction takes reality as we know and scientifically speculates on what may later occur based on patterns, events, nature, human behavior, etc. Granted it was far easier in the past; e.g., for someone like Jules Verne, to imagine possibilities because speculation wasn't so limited by what we now know. But one 'd have to be a fool to sincerely contemplate a post-apocalypse where humanity was limited to a non-stop choo-choo (Remember, it's not MY job to disprove such but rather your's to convince us of such probability- don't even try). The problem with S-P'r is that it takes itself so seriously with it's third-rate, undergraduate level political discourse. Such gravity is comic book level. At least HUNGER GAMES winked at you.PS/ My degrees are in liberal arts, not the sciences.

166,room102,Recommended,5,10 October 2015,"This is a French-Korean production, written and directed by South Korean director Joon-ho Bong (""The Host"", ""Memories of Murder"") based on a 70's French graphic novel, with a $40m budget and lots of known actors: Chris Evans, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer, Ewen Bremner (""Trainspotting""), Ed Harris, Paul Lazar (the cross-eye guy from Jonathan Demme movies) and the actress who played the little girl in ""The Host"".The whole movie takes place on an endless train in the near future, which acts like Noah's Ark or a micro-cosmos of society, after Earth has froze. OK idea for a plot (especially the political angle) and OK production, very little - but great - CGI shots, but the movie is way too long for its script.The plot is like a mish-mash of many dystopian stories/movies we've seen (""1984"", ""Metropolis"", ""The Omega Man"", ""Soylent Green"", etc.).

167,vjnambu,Modern masterpiece,10,2 June 2019,Snowpiercer narrates the revolt of tail section passengers of snowpiercer train led by Curtis to enter the ahead sections for survival. The biggest plus point of snowpiercer is director's imagination and creation of a post apocalyptic world. This film is technically topnotch. Every actors have given brilliant performances. Chris Evans gave his career best performance as Curtis. But the best performer of the film was tilda swinton as Wilford's spokesperson. But snowpiercer is not everyone's cup of tea.

168,Med-Jasta,Wow,1,11 February 2020,"I didn't know such a terrible movie could be made. So many things that don't make sense. I will begin:A train that goes around the world because it's frozen over?The guards don't have bullets in their guns at the end of the train but do further in where there's no threat?They are disgusted by eating bugs but they were eating people?When they ate people they were starving and eating them out of necessity by they were eating babies because they tasted better? And they pushed mother's away from babies to eat them? So they pushed the full grown human to eat a new born baby that had much less meat? I didn't know that people eating for survival were picky about their options.The badass guy is shooting a hole in the window of the train where it's freezing outside and we've seen what these freezing temperatures can do to little exposure? He's making two holes.Ed Harris needs a replacement because he's so old? He's not even that old!Did he build the train so a little kid HAD to go down and maintain it?So the two people that survive at the end are going out into the inhospitable elements with no means to survive to either be killed by the cold, lack of resources or those two polar bears.And my personal favorite: the fish? What the hell!? Everyone stops fighting so he can hold the fish and cut it? I thought that this meant something in Korea but the director said that it was a reference to the godfather. I kinda understand that on a literal level. It's not used in the same way or to the same effect. He argued with the producer to keep this part in the movie because he loved it so much. As any capable director will tell you, sometimes you have to cut your favorite scenes if it doesn't work. And this certainly didn't work and left me confused for days.This was one of the worst directed movies I've ever seen.

169,fciocca,There is something off about this movie,5,16 March 2020,"After watching ""Parasite"" from the same director, I was very curios about ""Snowpiercer"". I had great expectations, considering also what I read about it on the internet, but I was very disappointed. Setted in a dystopian future, in which humanity extinction is caused by an artificial ice era, the movie wants to contest how our society is structured, highlighting social injustices and showing how society can rebel at it, by finding alternative paths, and playing smart. At least this how I perceived it, but everyone can have his own interpretation about it.They could have express the message a little bit better. I would say that some scenes feels empty and there are some sequences that feels rushed and not coherent. There is definitely something off with action scenes, I was in fact expecting more from this department, but these scenes do not feel dynamic. There are a few unexpected moments along the way, but overall fighting scenes are missing something.From a technical perspective the movie is nothing exceptional: camera shots looks pretty ordinary if you ask (maybe this is caused also by limits that location had to offer, we are still talking about a train after all), as well as CGI sequences.",Snowpiercer
170,jayjaycee,One hell of a ride from the first to the last compartment!,8,3 December 2020,"""Snowpiercer"" is a 2013 science-fiction action film directed by Bong Joon Ho starring Chris Evans and Song Kang-Ho.
⚪
All in all, Bong Joon Ho's anglophone feature film debut narrates its gruesome story as unstoppably and uncompromisingly as its train dashes through the snow masses, and due to a stellar and superbly performing international cast, a straightforward and stylish direction as well as mercilessly diversified plot it becomes one hell of a ride from the first to the last compartment, that combines the beauty of Hollywood with the brutality of Korea and thus becomes a violent, disgustingly intriguing and devastatingly perverse dystopian movie that knows no limits and, since it is so unconventional, makes no prisoners at all.
⚪
It has been more than three years already since I stumbled across this unconventional gem that I have locked in my heart right after the first time I have watched it. Funnily enough, I didn't even know about this film's existence until I found this superb Steelbook edition on the rummage table at my local store and was immediately stunned by the stellar cast. I mean, next to Captain America Chris Evans you have legends such as Tilda Swinton, Ed Harris and John Hurt, as well as other familiar names like Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, Ewen Bremner and, even if I personally didn't know him back in the day, one of the director's most frequent collaborators, Song Kang-Ho. How could I have said no to this awesomeness? And after having seen the film for the very first time, I was nothing short of blown away by everything and knew that it wasn't just a marvellous cover but also a brilliant piece. As already said, that has been a while ago, and hence I thought a rewatch was long overdue, and I assure you, it touched me in the same way as it did then. Bong, nowadays known as the mastermind behind the Academy Award winning feature ""Parasite"", adapted the French graphic novel ""Le Transperceneige"" for his first anglophone movie, and what he created is a merciless action feast, but unlike other titles of the genre, he and created a perfect balance between beauty and brutality, and considering the subject matter, it is quite an achievement. What is it about, though? Well, after a weather experiment that was supposed to lower the global temperature and thus fight climate change failed miserably, the entire planet froze and turned into an uninhabitable tundra no human would be able to survive in. Only Wilford, who knew that the experiment would go wrong, was prepared for the apocalypse and built a train that would perpetually run, and only a few survivors who were luck enough to board the ""rattling ark"" form what is left of humanity, but as humans are humans and instinctively want to stand above others, the train has instantly become an ecosystem with an established class system. In the tail of the train, they live like in labour camps and jails while the people in the front live in abundance, and the film follows Curtis Everett (brutally portrayed by Chris Evans) who stirs up a rebellion and tries to reach the engine to put an end to oppression. I assure you, even if it sounds like it would become monotonous after a few wagons, there are enough development and resourcefulness so that it never becomes boring or repetitive. Of course, they conquer one compartment after another in a video game type of style, but it there are some twist that make it equally intense. Seriously, the film is an unforgiving hell ride from start to finish and constantly fluctuates between perversity and beauty. Already the discrepancy between the wagons is disgusting: in the back they live like in a pigsty, and the more they go on, the more the characters discover that they live in welfare and with no worries at all. I am not going to lie, this is downright outrageous to witness, but it isn't the only shocking about it. The film makes no prisoners at all and relentlessly depicts all sides of a rebellion and that there are also casualties in a war. Remember the outstanding cast I mentioned earlier? Well, don't befriend the characters too much, cause everyone is equally likely of dying in this film. Multiple times I was like ""Oh, my god! This is brutal, they are not gonna make it out alive!"" and then Bong ups the ante. One of those sequences is when the rebels are confronted with axe wielding soldiers, and as if this awesome fight sequence isn't already gruesome and stylishly shot enough, it turns dark and becomes a night vision combat scene. Like, holy cow! Just as I thought it couldn't become any more vicious, it just became. Furthermore, in many scenes Curtis is in a dilemma and has to decide what is right and what is not, and Evans conveys this turmoil superbly. Like, in one scene he sacrifices his right-hand man to take an important hostage, only to learn shortly after that it was in vain and that the people in the back have been tricked and brutally murdered. After this, he moves on with nothing left to lose and it is just so intense. In the final act, (after having had a shocking conversation with Nam about cannibalism that took place in the early days) he manages to reach the front and even have a chat with Wilford (Ed Harris, what a menace!) who tells him about balance and such stuff, and that the entire rebellion was planned from the beginning. Seriously, everything he thought he believed in all suddenly was lie, all the sacrifices useless. The troubled leader who constantly struggled with his position has lost everything. What remains, then? Well, after Curtis has made a final sacrifice, Nam blows up the train what causes it to derail completely, and then the most touching sequence of the whole film starts: The only survivors of the crash are Nam's daughter Yona and the little boy Timmy - except from them, literally everyone else has died. Wait, doesn't this mean that they are gonna die painfully in the cold? No, cause as it turns out, Nam's theory was true, especially when they meet a polar bear, proving that human life outside of the train is indeed possible again. But are there any chances, considering that only a seventeen-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy remain? Are they the new Adam and Eve? Will there be hope and a new civilization? Seriously, this ending is downright breathtaking and gave me severe goosebumps. In the end, Bong's graphic novel adaptation is dystopia at its finest. Perfectly adapted the concept, casted a diverse and brilliantly performing ensemble of actors and turned it into a damn fine choreographed action film that is as devastating and uncompromising as it is beautiful and thought-provoking. Not many films shake me to the very foundations for a myriad of reasons like this one. Heavily underappreciated gem!",Snowpiercer
171,jawneyfloros,the dirtiest grittiest futuristic movies yet,10,20 November 2018,Review: I loved this movie because it shows two very important things which are. That you that you can build a new society from scratch after a worse-case scenario. It shows you how important the fight for equality really is not just how we as a society perceive it. The direction and screenplay are incredible and fresh. The casting and acting are incredible and fresh also. The camera crew use their equipment to really make this movie the truly honest and at times bone chilling futuristic psychological thriller. The costume crew did an incredible job making some of the best and prettiest actors look like they are living in abstract poverty.

172,TheMarwood,Joon-ho Bong crashes this train,4,21 May 2014,"Snowpiercer is a dumb action film that is chock full of existential hooey about class struggle and rebellion on a train that circles the earth after it has frozen over. We follow the last people on earth crammed into a train that seems to change lengths throughout the film, and our heroes are the poor in the back of the train, who make it their mission to get to the front of the train. Subpar CGI doesn't help much here and there are gaps of logic that you could, well, ride a train through. Why soldiers would show up to the one place on the train they need bullets and not bring them is just an example of the contrived lazy screen writing to start off the uprising - if they had bullets, our leads wouldn't have an uprising and we wouldn't have a movie. This entire train is packing heat and limited bullet supply is never mentioned again. Where are the endless supply of cockroaches coming from to make the food bars? Why is there a clairvoyant woman? WHY? We are also treated to a performance by Tilda Swinton that should go down in the annals of truly awful acting. She seems to be channeling Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Chris Evans is decent here and holds the weight of such a stupid picture on his shoulders well. Octavia Spencer is fine as well, but Ewen Bremner can join Swinton in giving a cartoonishly awful performance. Were these two allowed to do whatever they wanted? Did Joon-ho Bong have any idea or control over the terrible choices they made? He has no control over the tone, which can go from gritty and depressing to something out of a cartoon. But what the hell, it's the apocalypse, these are desperate times and logic is also hitting hard times.",Snowpiercer

Anyone who rates this film above two stars hasn't matured beyond their tweens. Why adults would want to see this kind of disgusting story is something that should be looked into by a psychiatric program at a university. The film is set on a solar powered train that runs in long, long loop that runs around the world. The people on the train are the last survivors of the an environmental disaster that throws the world into a deep freeze. So much for global warming.

Snowpiercer is truly post-modern. It's surreal, in a supposedly real (though fantastic) setup. While following a compelling story, you get lost in charming characters, well-written dialogues, absurd situations, changes of tone, and beautiful scenographies. Mixed genres, of course, as each wagon of the train offers unique opportunities.
This double path (interesting plot and top-notch instant storytelling, scene by scene) is something very few directors can do - Tarantino is one them. Scenes like the new year's eve countdown are absolute masterpieces. Tilda Swinton delivers one of the best interpretations I can remember of by anybody. I wish there were more movies like this one.

180,squirrel_burst,"There's something here for everyone, and I rank it as one of the year's best.",10,13 March 2015,"I am a big fan of science fiction, so I'm always looking for a new favorite to add to my collection. It's not enough to have robots, aliens or mutants though, a great science fiction movie needs to offer something new and if it's truly great it also has some relevant messages in the plot. ""Snowpiercer"" is a fantastic science fiction film; it's everything I wanted to see.Based on the book ""Le Transperceneige"" by Jacques Lob, the premise goes something like this: Humanity tried to reverse the effects of global warming by releasing a chemical in the Earth's atmosphere. Unfortunately, it plunged the planet into a new ice age and civilization as we know it ended. All that remains of humanity is the crew and passengers of the Snowpiercer, a state-of-the-art train whose course spans the entire globe and is equipped with an engine that never runs out of power or needs refueling. With limited space and resources, a caste system has formed inside the train. The master engineer rides at the front. In the next cars are the people who bought first class tickets, followed by the ones who bought coach and way, way at the back are the people who barely made it on. Mistreated, far outnumbering the ""rich"" forward carts and outraged, they decide that enough is enough. Leading the rebellion is our main character Curtis (Chris Evans); a man determined to reach the Snowpiercer's main engine.I'm a firm believer that all great science fiction movies (ok, maybe not all, but MOST) do not really talk about an alternate future as much as they talk about the present. The message of ""Snowpiercer"" is an obvious one. Despite what you might believe, we're all living on a ""train"" with limited amounts of space and resources. The poor outnumber the rich, are mistreated by them and eventually enough is going to be enough. There's plenty to mine from that point of view, but what I really loved about this movie is that it's much more than that. This is also a solid, action-packed film. The members of the furthest carts are going to have to fight to get to the front, getting through locked doors, military forces and other defenses. It's not going to be easy. We've got superior numbers versus skilled and trained forces armed with better weapons. The forces are pretty evenly matched, but what the rich aren't counting on is the overwhelmingly powerful motivator that is desperation. That's still just the tip of the iceberg though. This is also a film that contains some powerful emotional moments and some brain-detonatingly explosive revelations. I'm not talking about lame twists, I'm talking about characters and the audience realizing that the situations they thought were black-and-white are actually incredibly complex, or that things you thought were true actually turn out to be enormous lives. The consequences of these twists are absolutely devastating (and in more than just one way).While watching the film, it just kept getting better and better for me because it really felt like I was being transported to a totally different world, with its own rules and terminology. One of my favorite things was the lingo used in the Snowpiercer. The outside world is, for all purposes, gone. All that's left of human civilization is what remains inside the train. That means that there really aren't any animals, but there are still ""extinctions"". What I mean by that is that several times during the film characters refer to things like cigarettes or other common items as being extinct. I know that sounds like sort of a throwaway little detail, but the details are what elevate this movie to a new level. People have to cobble together equipment that wasn't on the train initially out of whatever luggage or non-essential equipment is handy, like drugs made out of the chemical waste created by the Snowpiercer's engine. What also really impressed me was the way that the action and the plot take great advantage of the location. What do you think about when you think about trains? You think about bridges, tunnels, engines, different compartments, the danger of derailing, turns. All of these elements are incorporated in ways that are extremely intelligent into the story. I was baffled to see a world that felt so fresh and so real, despite the fantastic setting and the fact that it's all set in a moving vehicle.I found the action to be extremely exciting and satisfying, the performances to be solid, the characters memorable, the plot completely original and every moment made me love the movie more. There are times where the movie is an exciting war film, a tight emotional thriller, a game of cat-and-mouse, a dystopian horror story and there were even times where the movie got genuinely dramatic and emotional. I was so enthralled in the plot and the characters that I feel like I totally missed out on the cinematography, some of the symbolism and the score. Thankfully I had a friend with me who was able to point some of these wonderful details. I'm already looking forward to watching the film again.What I'm trying to get at is that I'm giving every praise I can think of to this movie because it is an absolute gem. I really hope that people are going to buy, rent or even better, see this movie in theaters because it deserves to be seen and to become an essential piece in ever sci-fi enthusiast. It might as well be a classic for me, because it's a movie that I can't wait to watch again and will recommend to everyone. ""Snowpiercer"" is a sci-fi masterpiece, courtesy of director Bong Joon-ho, who really shows off some impressive talents. I can't wait to add it to my collection and I hope to encourage as many people as I can to follow suit. (On Blu-ray, November 14, 2014)",Snowpiercer
181,nicolechan916,An engaging story with amazing acting but a weak ending.,7,3 August 2014,"Firstly, it is quite unrealistic for humanity to be able to survive on a moving train for 17 years. Let's say there is enough food on the train to last a lifetime, still the weather conditions on the outside would not permit the train to keep moving forever. How is the train not frozen? How is the train able to plough through ice mountains?Apart from that, this movie was pretty intense. The plot itself wasn't really unique, but the way it was delivered and executed was impactful. The acting was really superb. There was this scene towards the end where Curtis has a monologue and it really touches the heart. I knew Chris Evans could act, but boy he can act.There's also a lot of violence in this, but it wasn't as gruesome as it could have been, so I thank the director for that. The fighting scenes were not overdone like most movies tend to do, and it showed that these were not experienced fighters. It made it believable that these people were living on a train.However, when the revolution was passing through the train, it seemed smaller than it looks. I saw few beds and less people than I thought there would be. I guess they focused more on the plots and the main characters than the people at the front of the train. Also, another thing that I feel is a total waste, is the Yona character. The audience gets that she is something special but the movie ends without further exploring the opportunities of that character.Speaking of the ending. I didn't like it. I won't spoil anything, so let's just leave it at that.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com",Snowpiercer
182,akash_sebastian,Quite underwhelming; it isn't as brilliant as I expected it to be.,6,18 April 2014,"Quite underwhelming; it isn't as brilliant as I expected it to be. When actors like Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, John Hurt, Octavia Spencer and Ed Harris are associated with the first international project of an acclaimed Korean Director like Bong Joon-ho, one is bound to be excited by its prospects. I've loved Joon-ho's work, especially 'Memories of Murder' and 'Mother'. Though he proves to be an able Director with his first International venture, the movie doesn't have the usual touch of humanity his movies usually possess; you rarely sympathize with any of the characters or situations. The script has an overwhelming number of plot-holes; these could have been overlooked if the characters were properly developed. Many would say it's an interesting portrayal of class-division in society, but that doesn't compensate for the weak storyline. It keeps you interested till the end, but the ending doesn't give you the proper finish it leads up to. The acting is commendable, but the characters lack proper depth.The complete artistic setting of the train, the action sequences and the weird characters keep you intrigued throughout. But overall, the movie didn't have the impact I expected it to have. Hope Joon-ho's future international ventures are as charming and brilliant as his earlier works.",Snowpiercer

BUT. seeing every aspect that a movie needs to offer to be great, you realise that this film feels and is incomplete and at some points ""way to much"". The whole concept is exceptional and amazing, everything looks breathtaking, but as the movie goes on it escapes to much from the realism, even you exaggerate as much as you can (half of the cabines), even tho it's obvious that the director tries to prove a point. The main downfall of the movie is it's ending where it loses all of it's pace and it takes more than 20 minutes for the most simple and generic ending that could happen.",Snowpiercer

186,noahgibbobaker,Underdeveloped and underwhelming,6,15 September 2020,"Snowpiercer is set in a dystopian future where earth is frozen due to a failed attempt to stop global warming. All the survivors have to live on a constantly moving train for the rest of their lives. This is the second Bong joon ho film that I've seen, the first being parasite which I loved so I had fairly high expectations. My expectations were not met.I think the writing was really bad for a lot of this film. The dialogue was extremely exposition heavy and poorly written for the entire first act and most of the second act, there are lots of attempts at comedy that for me all feel flat and even ruined scenes for me. Characters just show up and give Curtis all the information he needs to continue moving up the train. This happens so many times whether it's Mason or someone we have never seen before the main characters will get the information they need told to them.The cinematography was for the most part bland but during the action scenes it was just awful, it was near impossible to actually understand what was happening during the fights which bored me during a few of the lengthy ones. Speaking of the fight scenes, they are terrible, mainly because of the choppy cinematography I mentioned but often they carried no weight as the characters were not fleshed out or particularly likable and I knew by the time it was finished they would just be told what they need to know anyway.The characters were another very poor aspect of snowpiercer. Curtis and Namgoong were the only ones with development and everyone else was used as plot devices to push the story forward, I didn't care when anyone died. Edgar and Mason were also really annoying and not funny. It's a shame, Tilda Swinton is one of favourite actresses and I really didn't like her character.There are things I liked about snowpiercer as well. The concept has a lot of potential and it was really good when we got to explore the train and look at the garden and, my personal favourite part, the classroom where the children are shown propaganda. The themes are also important, the class gap and how less fortunate people are treated and global warming and how everyone has to work together as it is destroying earth. I would prefer for themes to be conveyed more subtlety than they were but this doesn't affect the arbitrary number I assigned to this film.I know a lot of people like this movie and I can see why. It just wasn't for me. I would recommend this to you if you think the concept sounds interesting.",Snowpiercer
187,TheRedDeath30,Impressive English Debut for Impressive Director,8,22 October 2014,"I think it helped my viewing of this movie that I knew very little about it going into the movie. I am a fan of cinema, in general, but I would say that the majority of my viewing is horror and so it was that I saw this well reviewed on several of my favorite horror fan sites. I know only that it was about a class society on a train at the end of the world, so it was much to my surprise when the expected grim dystopian future film turned out to be so much more than that.This is absolutely bound to be one of those movies that will divide viewers quite a bit and will elicit varied reactions. There are plenty who instantly dislike anything with an ""artistic touch"" and will throw out words like pretentious and self-indulgent to bash this movie. Then there are the idealistic youth who will eat this up like candy and proclaim it to be a work of genius even though they may not understand some of the nuances (much like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). The real truth probably lies somewhere in between.There seems to be a lot of directorial talent coming out of South Korea these days and I really enjoyed this director's previous monster movie THE HOST. Here he take a script that could have been a disaster in the wrong hands and turns it into an intelligent, exciting action sci-fi movie. In a lot of ways this reminded me of THE FIFTH ELEMENT. Not just for the apocalyptic future themes, but for the memorably entertaining, over-the-top characters and situations that are presented while still feeling grounded in a grim reality. In many ways that reflects the graphic novel roots of this movie.I was immediately drawn in by how quickly we get to the action. This is not a movie that takes the first hour to develop character and tone before we start getting into the meat of the story. I was caught off guard by how quickly the plot kicks into gear. The director allows the back-story to develop as the plot goes along much as the ""rebellion"" is developing car by car along the train, which is the crux of the plot.You see, there is a class system on this train, with the wealthiest up front, the middle class in the middle and the poor majority residing in the ghetto at the tail of the train. They aim to take the train and create equality and must do so one car at a time as they take ownership of each. This also allows the movie to create different tones and sets. Each car is unique and thus allows for a miniature movie in each, whether it be a clash in the dark with the train lord's minions or a brightly colored school for wealthy children to devour the teachings of the train.Mainly this is about characters and there are many memorable ones. Tilda Swinton is fantastic. John Hurt's character is unique and stylistic. The Korean father/ daughter (the same combo from THE HOST) are excellent even as the only non-English speakers in the movie.I think what causes the most debate is the ending. It's something that I wasn't expecting, to be honest. As stylish as the film had been up to that point, I think I was expecting something more mundane. Your typical Hollywood ""good guys win/ bad guys lose/ everyone is happy"" ending. I was not expecting the twist in events and the multi- layered exploration of themes that we got. I'm still not entirely sure what I thought of the ending and it's the reason this is an 8 for me rather than something higher. The pre- climax revelation convo between Chris Evans and Song Kang Ho was excellent and may have served as a better ending. The actual final conversation between Evans and Ed Harris is a little more problematic. Did the movie do enough to make those themes resonate well? Is it just retreading the same thematic territory seen is no many sci-fi films and really ""rebellion"" films already? Did it reach too far? I'm still deciding on some of the answers to those questions myself, so I feel my rating is justified. An excellent first 90 minutes with an ending that didn't immediately blow me away with emotional impact.",Snowpiercer
188,chubarova,Anti-utopia.,8,6 May 2020,"This film could really surprise me. Firstly, the plot is quite interesting, shows social problems and how they shine in little society.

189,FallenEye,Wilford's Ark Kills the Story Arc.,6,23 September 2018,"""I know what ------ ----- like. I know ------ ---- best"".That line is the reason why Snowpiercer deserved to be a better offering than it was. That line, deserved to be part of a higher quality showing, it's so striking; and that is the reason why I've censored it, because I'd hate to ruin it for anyone. It's a line that delivers a meaty twist, in a film that wasn't quite able to carry its wobbly premise, albeit somewhat original.An entire civilization, an entire species, in a train powered by perpetual energy is a stretch as it is, however, with the right script and dialogue, it can be an extremely believable and capturing concept. Snowpiercer lacked a sizeable deal in that front. Apart from Tilda Swinton's awesome performance, because of her having an incredibly gripping script and role, Snowpiercer fell short at selling this concept's practicality.Snowpiercer has too many plotholes, that could've been covered well enough with a script that dedicated enough attention to the concept. Them explaining how water was harnessed was an exceptional inclusion, however the weak exposition as to how this echo system is able to survive and exist within a moving train was implausible.This film is daring, and I applaud it for that, however, it fails to some point, at living up to its promise. The performances are good all around, with Tilda Swinton being the greatest standout, and the mystery of this train's operations pulls one in well enough, but ultimately, given the direction this film took, Snowpiercer is as ridiculous as Noah's Ark, and what suck is, it didn't even have to be; it could've, with a bit more effort, been quite the Sci-Fi journey with more than just a one track mind. 6/10.P.S. Curtis can't be the first human being to have walked the total length of the train. Claude did it first, as she had to pick up Timmy and Andy, and Timmy and Andy also did it before Curtis, as we see them in the Engine room, and we know they come from the tail of the train. And it's mistakes like that, that truly do highlight how this film just didn't pay nearly enough attention on the script, as it focused too much on the concept.",Snowpiercer
190,austin0731,An underrated piece of work that should have been a classic,8,2 July 2017,"Snowpiercer was great, I have recently rewatched it and just knew that Snowpiercer would forever be a classic Sci-fi film that is gritty, clever and serves as a cautionary tale that reflects today's world. Back in 2014 it really came as a surprise and I don't think anyone was expecting this from someone who at the time was rather unheard of but it turned out to be one of my favourite films of that year.Snowpiercer essentially is a train that functions as a microcosm reflecting the society we live in today and it makes various social commentaries dealing with caste systems, equality and revolutions. The train perfectly captures that different in rank and importance amongst people, the rich at the front and the poor at the back. Director Joon-ho Bong captures the idea brilliantly and completest it with his style of quirk and weirdness. It was fascinating to move through the train as each carriage had its own function and themes from: food producing to classroom of brainwashed children. The film serves to tell us of the modern day world, to question our morality. Though many scenes and things seem absurd it really is a mirror of our world, which goes to show the absurdity of the society we live in. The film was wonderfully shot in a compact and claustrophobic environment and the performances were great across the board, from Chris Evans to Tilda Swinton to Ed Harris Snowpiercer is a real masterpiece and delivers an impactful message to its audiences.",Snowpiercer

Sure there are plenty of opportunities throughout to loudly declare what parts were stolen from what movie; and what plot holes and factual mistakes, logic fallacies, unrealistic situations.But the film itself is very well acted, directed, beautifully shot, the sets and costumes are gorgeous, the score is .. fine.Unfortunately it's just not going anywhere. This is not a film that's trying to make a statement, rather it's a film telling a story which you have heard elsewhere.And this is the focus of my review.

192,stills-6,Fails at every level,4,26 December 2014,"This movie will separate out the people who truly appreciate what kind of transcendence a really well crafted movie can create and convey to its audience, and the pretentious narcissistic film-goer who likes their fairy tales to be just obtuse enough to make them appear to be relevant morality tales.Take a look through the reviews of this movie and you will see just how many viewers have been fooled into thinking this movie has something to say. All it does is pander to an audience that wants its dystopian action movies to have enough of a message that it alleviates the guilt of watching a mindless action movie, an affliction that I sadly do not suffer from. Naturally, the ""message"" has so many divergent ideas that everyone who thinks they've figure it out finds themselves to be correct, much like getting all the right letters in the newspaper Jumble puzzle to spell out the funny answer. Raise your hand if you think this movie agrees with your political beliefs.It's a mess, all over the place without a cohesive idea that brings it together. I give credit to the Asian actors, and a few of the ""Tail Section"" actors for doing what they can with a preposterous script in this thinly veiled political pander job to just about everyone. OK, there are plot holes and things that don't make sense, but not everything has to stick to make the whole movie hang together. Lots of movies have these features and aren't sunk by them. But you lose me with such blatant disregard for them. A few minor ideas are explained in great detail, but the key ones are just lost. Don't get me started on the dystopian concept as a whole.But perhaps most unforgivably, the action sequences are weak. For being in a closed-room story, for being on a freaking train that can't stop or it will die, the action sequences are remarkably muted. They aren't intense enough to be exciting, they're not spectacular enough to be impressive, and they're not clever enough to be interesting. I apologize for writing so much about this movie that I didn't like, but I went into it thinking it was a good idea, and wanted to see what could be done with it. I like closed-room movies like this one, and I really wanted this to be good, but it let me down at every point.",Snowpiercer
193,nesfilmreviews,All aboard this highly ambitious sci-fi extravaganza.,8,27 June 2014,"A stunning, visionary example of dystopian science-fiction cinema at its best, South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's ""Snowpiercer"" is based on the French graphic novel - a blockbuster rich in style that successfully breaks through cultural and political boundaries.""Snowpiercer"" is brought to the big screen and offers a solid narrative, carefully drawn characters and — above all — respect for the audience's intelligence in high-concept genre cinema. While ""Snowpiercer"" and its world may be implausible, it's most certainly engaging, and further helping matters is Bong's impressive, sprawling international cast anchored by Chris Evan's strong central performance.""Snowpiercer"" is set in a distant future where a man-made ecological disaster has triggered a new ice age that has engulfed the planet and killed off all but a few hundred lucky survivors. Upending the social structure of society and transposing it horizontally, the upper-class has become first-class on the Rattling Ark - a gigantic speed train that contains a literal microcosm of a contemporary neoliberal society. The fortunate in the front of the train rule over the rest, where the rich dictate the rules in order to oppress the poor and underprivileged.Bong's vivid depictions -- aided by Ondrej Nekvasil's production design and Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography are beautifully orchestrated and captivating for the most part. That being said, one of the more significant issues with the film is the overuse of CGI in places, which does look sub-par at times, like stylized segments from a 1990's video game.Joon-ho creates an air of mystery and intrigue - as the passengers progress from the dark, rear tail of the train to the opulent splendour of the front carriages, ""Piecer"" evolves steadily, slowing providing information and further enriching its story with enough magic and wonder to suspend our disbelief entirely. The film's pacing is measured, but never slacks with adequate time taken out for nuanced, character- building scenes. You may recognize lots of inherent holes and flaws in its journey to salvation, but the movie confidently pushes its premise throughout its 126 minute run time.By the end, the film reveals itself as a surprisingly thoughtful contemplation projecting the problems of today into a science-fiction tomorrow, while it ties together a compelling story that continuously shifts. We all think we know what will happen here; the downtrodden are pushed to the limit, and as a result, they unite and rebel against their oppressors - exactly as we've seen countless times in a number of other sci-fi movies and it's all a bit predictable. ""Snowpiecer"" is the exception.",Snowpiercer
194,harrylosborne,A strong premise focused too much around the morals of mankind,6,29 May 2019,"A somewhat understated film, Snowpiercer managed to slide under the radar of blockbusters back in 2013, settling for a backseat role even with its considerable budget and cast strength. Centred around a perpetually-travelling train carrying Earth's only survivors following a failed attempt to halt climate change, a class system remains based on a person's location in the train (e.g., the working class at the tail, wealthy at the front); furthermore, those in the tail have torrid lives, fed the bare minimum and regularly separated from their children who are taken to the front of the train. Snow piercer documents their attempt to revolt against the higher authorities - an intriguing story that promises several twists along the way. Despite this, the film seems to confuse itself with the many different messages it wants to deliver along the way, all whilst apparently emphasising the constant evolution of species and cycles of nature.With a decent wallet to spend and a reputation to uphold, Joon-ho Bong (Okja) seems to take on more than he can chew: the first hour is sensible enough, detailing the situation on the train and the rumblings of a mutiny, but the film begins to lose track midway as ideologies are inappropriately crammed in. Fight scenes are plentiful, but detract from the beauty of the train itself, separate biomes for humans and animals alike, all off-limits to those from the tail. Towards the finale, all these concepts begin to merge into a confusing amalgam of symbolism and anterior motives, making the story harder to enjoy.The cast is more than prestigious, which makes the relative lack of buzz surrounding Snowpiercer even more confusing: Chris Evans, Ed Harris, John Hurt and Tilda Swinton all lend their talents, with Evans showing more ability than he's given credit for as Captain America. The train provides a wonderful environment for the film to play out in, as it can depict both claustrophobic and expansive areas seamlessly when moving from carriage to carriage. The relentless struggle to the front of the train (with revelations the further the revolting party travels) gives insight into the futures of everyone housed by the train, all whilst keeping the most crucial information just out of reach.Snowpiercer divides critics and viewers alike due to its apparent deeper meaning concealed behind an exterior of violence and flashy imagery. This is certainly to the detriment of the film, as those who would appreciate a more cerebral message will have been dissuaded by the apparently heavy violence, whilst those expecting only conflict will be left scratching their heads by the end. More watches will reveal more information, but any fans of dystopian futures or sci-fi-esque stories should give Snowpiercer a chance. - HLO",Snowpiercer
195,tfminfl,All Aboard!,9,29 October 2019,"70. Snowpiercer. One of those awesome apocalyptic films that makes you wanna ride a train. It reminded me of a bunch of other stuff thrown in there... Battlestar Galactica directed by Terry Gilliam on a train heading Beyond Thunderdome, there was even a scene where I felt Resident Evilish as well. (Our heroes go into a train car and encounter all these dudes with black masks on and giant axes, I instantly thought that Alice was about to come in and wipe them out.) So whats its about you ask, instead of looking it up your damn self? Its about a self-sustaining train that loops the world after global warming has sent us into another ice age. The train in seperated by class, workers way in the back, rich folk up front. And its all about a revolution to take over the train led by Captain America, Billy Elliot, and Kane from the Nostromo, to bust to the head of the train, and take over, I guess. Tilda Swinton gets to be called by her real name, because she's awesome, once again, and even Ed Harris pops up in there! ""Nice."" The best line is delivered by Captain America:""You know what I hate about myself? I know what people taste like. I know babies taste the best."" However I can't really picture Chris Evans doing that, he looks to nice, The Capt America image has gone too far. Anyways, its a cool movie and definitely needs to be watched!!",Snowpiercer
196,brianberta,A great action film with social commentary,8,13 February 2016,"One of the main flaws in many action films is that they're style over substance. This is mainly because it's a lot harder to develop and provide depth to characters in an action driven movie as opposed to a story driven movie. Some action movies are able to provide character development and depth in them, but some films like this one do something else to get around the common style over substance criticism. It uses social commentary to tell its story and to make it more interesting.In the far future, an attempt to stop global warming leads to an ice age where most of the world's population is killed by it. Some of the survivors spend their lives on a train called ""The Rattling Ark"". In the train, the middle and upper class residents live in the middle of the train and the ""scum"" or the lower class live in the back of the train where their treatment and living conditions are very poor. One of the lower class residents, Curtis Everett, decides to lead the tail passengers in a revolt where he plans to take them all the way up to the engine. Since they can only fight them with whatever they can find and pick up along the way, doing so proves to be a difficult task.One thing I really like about the film is the set design of many parts of the train. It is interesting to see the train go from a slum-like living quarter to brightly and vividly colored rooms with different designs and layouts of the objects. Since each of the rooms all look different, this makes it so the film doesn't seem neither repetitive nor bland at all. This is a good feature to have in films as it gives a somewhat artsy and creative feel to them. It is pretty cool to see that the uninviting and dull looks of the back of the train can look so much better in the middle train cars.The action scenes are pretty unpredictable and tense since we quickly learn that main characters can be killed off so easily. After one of the characters that I thought would be one of the main characters in the film died so soon, I realized that this would be a movie that is not afraid of killing off its characters, even some of the ones that most would probably care about the most. This is a good trait to have in films because it gives them a sense of daringness not found in many other action films.People who say that this is just a typical action thriller are completely missing the point of it. It uses social commentary to shape its plot. The movie represented the political structure of our world in the microcosm of the train. The people in the back of the train represented the people who live in the third world who are struggling for their lives. The people who were partying and having a happy time in the middle section of the train represented the people in the first world who get to afford nice homes, have nice jobs, and basically get to live overall happy and peaceful lives. This is represented best in the film when it shows Curtis traveling through the sections of the train which show numerous people partying and having a good time. That represents how most people who live in the first world turn a blind eye to all the people who are having a difficult time going about their days in the third world as they get to live in the middle of the train. It's unfortunately realistic that only one of the people in the middle of the train, Namgoong, is able to see through all of what's happening and is willing to help them. This represents how most people in today's world are distracted by their luxuries and they don't bother with helping people less fortunate than they are. The only difference between the film and today's world is that most of the people in the middle and upper class got to relax and didn't have to work at jobs unlike most first world people today, but keep in mind that this film is a metaphor, not an exact replica of reality. This means that in the future, middle class people will get to relax while the government hands them out wages except a few people who most likely volunteered to work. Overall, this movie painted an accurate and detailed description of how the train represented today's social class.Also, the acting is pretty great as well. Chris Evans performs his lines well as he never sounds over-the-top and he is able to switch from scenes where he plays a hate-fueled 'prisoner' who is aching for revenge to scenes where you can sympathize for and understand his motivations and what he had to go through while he was in the back of the train. Also, many of the other actors such as Song Kang-ho, Jamie Bell, and Octavia Spencer helped carry the movie as well as they brought their own unique skills and talents to the table and they were all pretty good in their own way.In conclusion, this is an ambitious and entertaining action film which succeeds on every level. People who say that this is just a typical style over substance action film need to watch this with a far more critical eye. The social commentary it uses is well-written and effective. Also, the set design and acting also help make this movie even better. This is now my favorite film of 2013 and I strongly suggest watching it if you want to find a modern action film which plays its cards differently than most other films of the genre.",Snowpiercer
197,drunken_munki,Lacking pacing; dialogue too raw; characters are simple; plot holes are too numerous,4,22 October 2020,"Oh but 'the social commentary' I hear them cry like I missed something out. The movie, sad to report, fails to keep itself afloat long enough to care about the commentary, or the story for that matter.The science of this film is laughable. Maybe it is a parody? The train itself runs on infinite free energy? So why is everyone fighting and killing each other? If this was actual social commentary then it would highlight what pure evil is, and how pure evil distorts the truth and puts everyone in a pit of lies and then they fight each other.But we didn't get that did we; no no we get a movie that gripes on about 'classes' and people hurting each other over resources and that is it. As if the earth an all of the problems in it are because of these things alone.Anyway you notice my review hardly describes the movie proper, that is because the film is missing many components such as competent cinematography, and good music. The plot is wafer thin, and no character undergoes any change. The acting is average. The mix of languages is a little annoying, and serves no real purpose.4/10, overrated in my book. I'd recommend 'The Platform' instead.",Snowpiercer

199,Dragonsouls,Great allegorical storytelling.,7,4 November 2014,"I can't remember the last time I saw a film like this, and Snowpiercer will forever be mentioned in the same breath with films such as 1984, Blade Runner and Brazil, just to name a few. This is allegorical, multi-layered storytelling that will surely make viewers take a closer look at themselves long after the end credits roll. Each character represents a certain ideal, or political party. Each train car insinuates toward a facet of our economy, ranging from factories to schools, to militarism and to the men behind the curtain that run them. I also thought there were many theological connotations, most notably, the progression through the train. Each train-car was separated by gates, (minor spoiler ahead) and the final gate led the way to an all powerful, god-like character--representing the peak of spiritual ascension.When watching it, don't take it too seriously, because the story was not meant to be realistic. It's more enjoyable if you watch it with an open mind. It's hard to describe how great this film is without giving too much away, but all I'll say is that its a very symbolic film, beautifully shot, superbly acted, but poorly directed. Perhaps it was just mediocre. If someone told me that Paul Anderson or Len Wiseman directed this film, I would surely believe it. In terms of aesthetic quality and action, it felt like the film was aimed at teens, and some of the comedic elements in the story felt out of place. But of course, the main draw is the story itself, which I probably would have preferred in the form of a novel--rather than this film.Nevertheless, the acting by Chris Evans was superb, and it was probably his best performance of his career. John Hurt was also great as the elder leader of the commoners, and a former revolutionary. He seemed to fit his role well, considering that he starred in 1984.All in all, a memorable film, brilliant in concept, but flawed in its execution. It's a film I'd watch again, no doubt, because the story is pure genius.",Snowpiercer

Everything is fluid in this beautiful movie and everything moves, from titles to music, in tune with the fantastic setting created by Mr Joon-on Bong. For me, a long time comic book addict, it was the best graphic novel-based movie that I ever saw.

Snowpiercer is a surprising exception. This film follows a great concept executed in a great way. Acting, action and story stand out here the most. A few downsides would include some scenes that go by too fast or too slow. Pacing could be a bit off for me whenever a scene was delivering exposition. Snowpiercer is one great action movie that tells a timely message that still applies to today.",Snowpiercer
205,foxtografo,Could have been better,5,13 July 2014,"I would like to give this one a 5.5, but it's not possible, and a 6 seems unfair for my standards. The movie has an interesting set up for an action film, but the develop is so poor and full of plot holes that as they accumulate, it makes the story more and more unacceptable. Even when it's a sci-fi story, so many things make no sense and gets you distracted by the ""why""s and the ""what if""s that is hard to enjoy the movie. I liked the atmosphere and the character type, avoiding the young pretty faced muscled bunch, but the personalities and behaviours are most of the time completely ridiculous and nonsensical. Many characters were wasted, and much potential on scenery was wasted too, I guess the script needed a lot of polishing yet... There was a good twist in the story at the end that gives some extra points too. The fight scenes were too shaky in my opinion, could have been better. The apocalyptic theme is what made this movie for me, but I was very disappointed in the movie as a whole.I had a lot of expectations on this one, but it failed.

For some of the scenes the train would have had to have been as wide as a football field (the 'aquarium'); in other scenes it's obviously very narrow. The violence was way over the top, and quite ridiculous. How would someone standing in front of a gang of men armed with machetes, hatchets, knives, and clubs, in a space the width of a train car, be able to survive unscathed? How would a train run continuously for years without maintenance? And the ending; what are we to make of it? Did everyone die? Were they going to be able to survive somehow? I knew that the concept of the movie was a stretch, but the trailer made it look interesting. However, it was anything but.",Snowpiercer

It made me feel uncomfortable throughout. I thought it was a real mess and didn't really enjoy it. So many plot holes, the train itself being one. How can a train just keep going without proper maintenance of the train and the tracks. It picked up towards the end and then had one of the most ridiculous endings I have seen. Pretty awful. It gets three stars for Swinton, Harris and Evans performances and the originality of the story. I hear they may be making a tv show based on it.

208,mgruebel,The train is not surreal enough,6,5 March 2015,"The snow-piercing train is surreal metaphor: you can move forward in it, but it's going in a circle. The problem with this class warfare epic by Korean director Bong, featuring Chris Evans as the hero and Ed Harris in a cameo as the mysterious train conductor antagonist, is that it is not surreal enough.This is one of those films that many will love if they're willing to embrace the surrealism despite the critical flaws, and others will hate because the message is just too obvious, and the delivery not surreal enough to make up for it.There is plenty of surrealism in this film: tunnel aquaria built into train wagons, clockwork train mechanisms with small children inserted into them as parts, a wagon-full of Ninjas equipped with night vision goggles, white landscapes of a frozen Earth through which the train hurtles. There is also plenty of class warfare, as Evans advances from the steerage section in the back of the train towards the engine, encountering murderous school teachers, middle class passengers, and the effete degenerate rich. Food symbolism is important. Evans works his way up the food chain by fighting past protein bar assembly lines, greenhouses, meat lockers and sushi bars. It is amusing that he finds nutrition bars made from insect protein disgusting even though he has eaten babies, as we find out later in the film! Baby meat=yes, Insect=no, what a picky American eater we have here.The real problem is that the setting is so contrived (a train hurtling around a frozen Earth for 17 years, requiring no repair of tracks and impervious to frozen ice boulders covering the rails, which are pierced like paper bags), that the film really needed to go for surreal all the way. And that it did not. There is too much conventional action movie, soap-operatic petty betrayal, the-villain-that-does-not-stay-dead, and other worn clichés embedded in this film. The viewer does not get a chance to become one with the surreal atmosphere, as one can sitting at the Prado in front of a Salvatore Dali painting or a work by Hieronymus Bosch.Frankly, I think the only way Bong could have pulled this off is by making the film in anime. A stylized cartoon look would have lent itself to symbolisms like the bleeding fish, sharp curves where the train suddenly grows an extra 30 wagons between the antagonists shooting at each other, ninjas in the dark, bleak snowy landscapes, and the impossibility of the whole situation, which is staged just to make the point.Unlike Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil,"" the film lacks the charm and ambiguity of an everyman in love mixing up his dreams and reality, and unlike ""1984,"" it lacks even remote plausibility. I could go on with other unfavorable dystopia-comparisons. The director probably saw the polar bear staring at the 'last boy and girl' coming out of the train at the end of the film as a symbol of hope, that we did not extinguish everything. I see it as a polar bear eying his lunch: He must be quite hungry because there's nothing else out there, and yet it does not take a lot of ecology knowledge to realize that any cold survived by a fattened polar bear will also be survived by plenty of humans for 17 years, thanks to something known as 'technology.' I can see the alternate dystopic film: people huddled in caves artificially illuminated and heated by the new generation of Westinghouse nuclear reactors, growing hydroponic vegetables... enough said.Although I love to hate this film, thanks to great set design, properly understated acting by most, and good direction, it leaves a better feeling the next day than many well-meaning but failed attempts, and so I give it a 6/10. I am disappointed, but strangely, I did not feel that I wasted my time watching it.",Snowpiercer
209,stephendaxter,Very well acted and directed with a few hiccups,9,7 December 2014,"Bong Joon Ho has created a very unique and ambitious film that explores a future in which the only remaining humans are surviving on a constantly moving train. It has a much darker tone that isn't usually seen in this type of film and that is what really sets it aside from other future/post-apocalyptic films. Bong Joon Ho explores many messages and themes throughout the film regarding humanity and the way we try to survive, and these themes really drive the plot and carry it through the various stages of the film. In terms of the acting, Chris Evans provides us with an amazing performance that will be recognized as one of his best. The development of all the characters allows you to really understand the motivations of each individual, making each action important to realizing their true natures. Aside from the great performances and directing i feel that the film lost what made it unique in the final quarter as it attempted to come to a close. Its many attempts at trying to justify some of the events that occurred throughout the film seemed to make the ending look a little sloppy but it wasn't enough to ruin the overall experience this movie gives you. It is a very well directed and well acted film that could have been even better with a more polished ending. - 8.5",Snowpiercer
210,MichaelMRamey,Unique And Enjoyable!,7,23 April 2018,"This was a fun film to watch because of its linear simplistic story. You get a good understanding of the plot at the beginning and it's literally getting from the back of the train to the front, while going through different unique and sometimes visually pleasing train cars. I would go as far as saying the is the best performance of Chris Evans I've ever seen. Would highly recommend just based on the good Sci-Fi plot.",Snowpiercer
211,Radu_A,"10 for art, 6 for acting, 3 for story",6,7 April 2014,"I've waited a long, long, looooong time for this release, which was pushed back twice - which of course raises the question if this train film might be a train wreck. It certainly left both critics and viewers divided, which isn't always a bad thing - some of the more interesting films of late have tried to push at least visual boundaries - for example 'Holy Motors' or fellow Korean director Park Chan-wook's 'Stoker' (who produced this). But the story in these efforts, as in many recent films from all over the world, doesn't seem to matter anymore as much as style does.So I went into this comic book adaptation with mixed expectations - I regard Bong Joon-ho as one of the few really interesting directors cinema has left, a true artist who has proved that he can combine a strong narrative with a unique style, and still generate enormous commercial success - as in 'The Host'. And on that note, his first international production with a number of big names doesn't disappoint. The gritty Dystopian imagery fits the story, the countless visual references to SciFi classics are ambiguous enough to pass as homage (like, Ed Harris' character in respect to '2001').What leaves me, with what seems to be the majority of viewers here, slightly disappointed, is in part the story itself, in part the huge disparity of the acting. It's not so much that the allegory of the story is all that terrible or unbelievable - all Dystopian stories are allegorical -, it's that it simply doesn't add anything to the theme. 'Hunger Games' has pretty much set the standard for the Dystopian genre now. That makes the late '80s/ early '90s look of the fight scenes rather lame - especially since they're almost ridiculously bloodless. Think back 25 years though - this would have been pretty impressive back then. And of course the comic book the film is based on dates from that time. So if you're in your 30s or 40s, you'll find this film quite enjoyable - as opposed to the majority of action flicks nowadays. If you're in your 20s or teens and want to watch this because of Chris Evans' Marvel kudos, it's a fair guess that you'll be disappointed.As for the splendid set design and photography, I'm afraid most of it may be lost to the viewer, given that 'Snowpiercer' comes across as an action film. In 'The Host', the monster CGI was in perfect sync with Song Kang-ho's acting. Here, he plays a rather useless side character - as the lead, he might have been much more believable than Chris Evans, who in spite of his beard is much too boyish (and well fed) for this kind of role, but is still very much the center of the film. This seems to me the most frustrating aspect of 'Snowpiercer': brilliant performances (by Swinton and Harris) and OK performances (by Bell and Hurt) are killed off by a rather uninspired Chris Evans. It's definitely a missed opportunity for an older actor with more edge, like Hugh Jackman or Mads Mikkelsen. A lesson to be learned by directors from 'Snowpiercer' is that if your script contains a line like 'Babies taste best', you gotta think hard if your lead can deliver this convincingly.All in all, this is by no means a bad film, and may both be appreciated for its art as for its action by older viewers. It's definitely not going to please Marvel fans, though, and it could have been much more with a better script and a better lead.",Snowpiercer
212,priyantha-bandara,A big Sci Fi with a heart,7,14 April 2014,"Since the dawn of fear by several theories that stands a chance in ending our civilization for good and advanced CG to bring them to life on the screen, apocalyptic science fiction are the kind of movies that seeing so often. But the Snowpiercer stands at a unique position among many of those mundane films for several good reasons. And it's worth watching.This movie is based on the French graphic novel ""Le Transperceneige"". While being a thought provoking piece of concept for a graphic novel when it's presented as a movie the plot seems utterly impractical to begin with. Basically Snowpiercer is a train with a perpetual engine that creates never ending energy that's running through many continents on the frozen earth for the last 17 years continuously. That's right the earth has entered an ice age and the all known living beings are now almost extinct. The only survivors are on the Snowpiercer but it has a major issue on board. That's the class system that divides the passengers in to front section privileged to almost ghetto conditioned tail section. An uprising is brewing and no one has ever succeeded in hi jacking Snowpiercer. And it's going to be different this time.The first question that comes to any sensible mind is that who maintains this rail road and how come the train is running for so long without any stops. But then the movie does not provide you any answers for that so the best is to keep that aside and move on with the plot. When you ignore that elephant in the room you start to witness a story that is so creative and brilliant. And it all boil downs to humans and their spirits that's warm and courageous even in the most harsh of conditions they are forced to live in. You will start to witness struggles, sacrifices, leaderships, betrayals and above all that hope for survival. And the story flows without hesitation with the cast moving from carriage to carriage of the train unfolding never seeing environments and challenges to face. And steadily it arrives at its destination where there are surprises wait. By the time the movie ends it provides many satisfactory answers to some burning questions but open doors for many more. However the ending is fulfilling.You will witness solid performances by many and amongst them Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton are the best. Good cinematography and score yet the CG seems a bit poor comparing to the big budget Hollywood movies nowadays. But that does not harm to enjoy this far as I see. Because Snowpiercer does not depend on CG to make a mark. And there are some fine set creations also can be witnessed as from carriage to carriage of the train it's a whole different mood and atmosphere.Snowpiercer delivers something beyond scientific representation of a possible future disaster and action filled blood stains on the walls. Therefore I would say it is a successful movie.",Snowpiercer

I literally had no info about this film prior to watching it except for that Chris Evans (Captain America) is in it and it is set in a post-apocalyptic world. A friend recommended it to me and I downloaded it at the spot. Months later, decided to watch it and cursed myself for not watching it sooner. The premise of the movie is that the world has been frozen over thanks to failed human experiment of stopping global warming and the only survivors are now on a special train. I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic worlds/dystopian futures and surely enough, I liked the plot from the start. Fittingly enough, the movie felt like an immense train ride that you truly experience and reflect back upon countless hours after it has been over. Even with a small setting (A Train), the movie had this epic feel to it and had some pretty bad ass moments. Action scenes were awesome.On the surface, it is a good enough movie, but what really surprised me was how MUCH MORE this movie was. There are innumerable hidden messages/allegories in this movie, and the more I thought outside the box and took this movie metaphorically, the more amazing it became. I'll keep things vague so it doesn't spoil the awesomeness. If you can look past its outer shell, I can guarantee you will love this movie. If not, then you might not like it. :pActing was overall pretty good. Chris Evans was awesome in this movie. Other performances that stood out for me were of Ed Harris and John Hurt, even if they didn't get that much screen time. The soundtrack was good, and had some really great pieces in it and were perfectly used to increase the tension. Great cinematography too at times. Overall, I Highly Recommend this movie.

The train is divided into harsh social classes with the back of the train's lower class is treated like slaves. This is when Chris Evans decides to lead a revolt to take control of the front of the train.-The film itself is very interesting. The concept is very unique and the style of the film is very engaging, complete with a very fast pace and good action. However, the film does get weird, and a little confusing, and a little dumb.-The plot works really well, until it gets confusing and then tries really hard to be impressive and unpredictable, leaving the audience confused and not caring much anymore.-The pace is great for the most-part, but it really dies down as the plot changes at the end.-The cast did okay. Chris Evans was easily the best and Ed Harris did very well do. The White Witch though, who played the big-haired girl from the Hunger Games, was annoying and overacted.-Music was meh.-Effects were good for the independent film it is.-There were some very funny moments, but the film tried to throw several bold moments in, which left me caring less instead of effected by them. Oh, except for one kinda early on. So it had some good and some bad moments.-Content was not too bad. It is rated-R. It has a light-moderate amount of language and a light amount of violence for R. It did throw in some other conversations about topics like cannibalism that left me not wanting to watch anymore of the movie, or at least watch the first half again.-So overall, Snowpiercer started out as a very good, very original action packed sci-fi movie about fighting social classes, and it did have its moments, but the film tried hard after that and I completely lost interest, and then more interest.

217,metalrage666,Better than expected,7,27 April 2014,"I quite enjoyed this as it was at least a different spin on a tale of survival in a climate devastated world.Mankind devises a way to lower the temperature of the Earth by spraying a gas/chemical into the atmosphere via high level planes in an attempt to reduce global warming. It's a different kind of idea and it works for a while, however it works a little too well and the earth is plunged into a gigantic deep freeze effectively killing off all life. Rather then bury themselves underground in huge army controlled bunkers like other movies I've seen, Snowpiercer is instead an immensely long train that runs on perpetual motion as it careens around the world at breakneck speed.As a work of fiction it's great and there's plenty of action throughout that will keep most people enthralled, if you can steer away from the obvious flaws in science that would make an unstoppable high speed train traveling around in icy world with the last remnants of the human race sheer lunacy.The train itself is explained as being specifically designed and engineered to withstand high temperatures and the sudden cold temperatures in alpine regions, so the fact that there is constant below freezing temperature outside doesn't adversely affect those inside.The train is basically split into 2 classes, the wealthy elite in the front portion and the lower classes relegated to the back. After about 18 years of constant traveling, those in the rear decide that they have had enough of the oppression, meagre food rations and squalid conditions so they plan a revolt to make it to the front and take over the ever important locomotive and the inventor that controls it.Most of the movie involves the ragtag group of rebels lead by Chris Evans in an effort to get to the front and kill anyone who gets in their way. As they make their way forward, they realise more and more the opulence that they have been missing out on and in their struggle to control the train, most of them end up being killed.The train itself lives up to its name as it literally pierces through snow drifts and various avalanches that cover the track from time to time and we learn that this is the way the train gets it water, by filtering snow and ice via the engine. However the poor ending and the lack of viable science made me give this only 7 stars. While the train may be designed to withstand constant subzero temperatures, (cold enough to literally freeze a man's arm solid), I'm sure that the metal tracks and very high bridges would not stand up so well. Metal that is not maintained and constantly in a frozen state would become brittle after 18 years and a train traveling at such high speeds in blizzard conditions is a death sentence waiting to happen. Like most modern disaster/action movies the ending didn't make much sense for me. In order to escape the train they decide to blow open a side hatch which triggers a massive avalanche that hits the side of the train effectively de-railing the train in the process. Carriages plummet down into a ravine and anyone else on the train was killed in the fireball that ripped through what remained. So this effectively kills off the last remaining humans except for a South Korean Girl and an African American boy. So if this is some kind of Adam and Eve thing it's not going to work, she's 17 and he's only 5, and while the icy waste may be OK for polar bears, 2 ill- equipped kids won't last very long.

The performances were pretty good overall. Chris Evans gives a really stellar performance, and has some stand out moments, such as a monologue he gives later in the film that is excellent. Tilda Swinton also gives a fun performance that is really odd but interesting to watch. The rest of the actors fit their parts quite well.

Hollywood jumps on the-end-of-the-world bandwagon multiple times a year, and there's no excuse for other countries to do the same. A striking example from last year includes Elysium, wherein the majority of mankind is left to suffer on an overpopulated Earth while the rich live a life of luxury up in space. Directed by native South-African Neill Blomkamp, he utilized his home land settings and talent to great effect, though ultimately the Hollywood approach in terms of story and marketing prevailed. Not so with Snowpiercer, which dabbles in very similar themes, but proves to be enriched an experience by a rather un-American sensibility, courtesy of South-Korean director Joon-ho Bong.Snowpiercer's premise has to be taken with a grain of salt, at the risk of sounding ludicrous. Set in the year 2031, seventeen years after a worldwide attempt to halt global warming by dispersing cooling gasses into the atmosphere went awry, our planet suffers under an ice age that covers the globe in snow. Humanity's last survivors live aboard a huge train, where a rigid class system has developed. The poor masses are relegated to the back of the train, while the wealthy live in the front in comfort. Powered by a perpetuum mobile, the train rages over the frozen planet's surface, seemingly ad infinitum. While the haves party to their leisure, the have-nots suffer endlessly, huddled together in squalor. Biding their time under the command of the calculating Curtis, the dispossessed plot their revolution, hellbent on overthrowing the system and taking over the train. Such a plot line seems thirteen-a-dozen when it comes to dystopian cinema, but the unusual element of the train makes all the difference, if you're willing to accept this rather bizarre concept.'Bizarre' is exactly right to describe Bong's approach to Snowpiercer. With The Host, he delivered a monster-on-a-rampage movie unlike any other, while his celebrated, twisted thriller Memories of Murder firmly rooted him as a commentator on the human capacity for violence. Snowpiercer fits right into his resumé and stylistically reveals him to have auteur tendencies. The cruel and the weird go hand in hand in his clash of classes. Bong takes his time to explore the train and its hierarchy. As the desperate rebels slowly but surely work their way to the front of the train, Bong keeps surprising us as much as his protagonists with each compartment they enter. But each discovery also comes with new dangers, both physically and in terms of resolve, as Curtis moves ever closer to the 'end boss', and upon meeting him finds out the true machinations of the powers-that-be.Bong tells his strange tale of revolution through an international ensemble of actors. You'd be inclined to think of Evans as a typical all-American hero leading the quest for freedom, but you'd be much mistaken, as the character carries a sordid past that would write him off as such. The same is true for Jamie Bell, his hotheaded sidekick, whose relationship with his leader is more disturbing than you would at first glance suspect. Bong surprises you continuously with the twisted interrelations between his protagonists. John Hurt plays an archetypal wise old man as he has done on many occasions, but what we come to know about him again subverts expectations, as do the motives of the demolitions expert/drug addict Kang-ho Song and his clairvoyant daughter. The audience is being toyed with in their mental perception of ""the good guys"" as it is in regards to the physical appearance of the baddie, Mason, an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton in an outrageous costume. Nevertheless, the cast succeeds in relaying the fact this class conflict isn't as black and white as you would believe; the line between good and bad is as thin as the rails that keep their train going.Even more colourful is Bong's sense of style. Clearly a confined space, Bong makes good use of it to show off his train in flexible cinematography and a colour scheme to match. Starting off with the tormented oppressed, he sticks with an abundance of brown tones and cramped, crowded spaces for the first hour, before he lets in the light and dazzles both the revolutionaries and the audience with the rich, vibrant world of the oppressors. A vegetable garden, an aquarium walkthrough, a classroom car; we're confronted with whatever we expect the least, and Bong has it all make sense. He still throws us off-guard in terms of the flow of the narrative. Bong makes use of the occasional off-beat, absurdist moment that adds to his weird train, but suggests the director's dark predilections. A brutal showdown between the tyranny and the insurgents is postponed by a New Year celebration, while a cheerful classroom scene explodes in a bloody shootout, the presence of children notwithstanding. Not the type of thing you'd find in American dystopian flicks. The climax however does leave room for hope, which feels out of place and hints at studio interference from the American investors. As for the action scenes, they are all sufficiently choreographed to make you bite into the mayhem, despite the oddities Bong throws at you. Unfortunately many visual effects shots of the world outside prove rather digital, making you wish Bong would stick to the train, which is where all the excitement happens.Snowpiercer's premise and the logistics of its world might be hard to accept, but Bong makes it work. He keeps surprising you, confronting you with your own expectations, fed by having seen mostly American takes on the conflict between good and evil in dystopian societies. If you accept Bong's craziness and unwillingness to adhere to orthodox storytelling, Snowpiercer proves an intriguing ride, though not everyone will be able to stay on board, violent, disturbing and messed up as it deservedly can be called.",Snowpiercer
221,FilmMuscle,Prepare To Have Your Mind Blown,10,26 June 2014,"During its lengthy development, Snowpiercer's director (revered South Korean filmmaker, Bong Joon-ho) encountered a great deal of issues with the film's signed distributer, the infamous Weinstein Company. Debates over its length and content were unsurprisingly sparked between Joon-ho and Harvey Weinstein, but in the end, a final deal came to fruition: the production would stick to its director's vision but consequently, its distribution would be very limited. Such is the sad state of affairs when it comes to artistic integrity and creative ambitions in the world of Hollywood, and after witnessing this long- anticipated picture, this incessant battle made a lot of sense— Snowpiercer is incredibly uncompromising and seeks to rebel against conventional action/sci-fi. First off, albeit the dystopian setting, it still carries a highly fascinating premise that's able to stand out from the rest of the apocalyptic tales. In the time of a demolished earth due to extreme forces of climate change (mostly every region is frozen to the very icy core), very few have actually survived as a result, and those few are now part of a controlled society within a train that circles around the entire world, fully immune to the harsh weather that lurks outside it. A whole government has been set up therein to sustain what little of humanity there is left, and of course—as is usual—we have the bottom rung of (impoverished and grubby) people, robbed of pleasure and value, and we have the elite who call the shots. They're the ones who eat the sushi and enjoy an ecologically-balanced environment in the front of the train while the poor are kept at the tail—their only option of food are ""protein blocks"" (food disgustingly furnished from various insects and produced into tar-like bars). Furthermore, an apparently benevolent and relatively peace-driven man named Mr. Wilford is the ultimate commander here as he was the founder of this technologically and environmentally- adequate locomotive. As if you hadn't already noticed, the resemblance to the direction of our contemporary world's movement is alarming to say the least. Anyway, aside from its incredibly rich narrative, Joon-ho's latest feature is driven by imaginative adrenaline of which is all too rare in modern action films. With 2014's The Raid 2 and now this, Asian filmmaking has numerously proved by now that it can definitely outshine Hollywood's tired and unoriginal action scenes. In this case, we get some amazingly stylized and ingeniously-lit action sequences, complemented with uniquely brilliant camera-work and Asian-staple choreography. That's what I've come to learn: choreography is the absolute key to delivering an entertaining and explosive fight, but unfortunately, it seems to be missing in many recent action flicks. Korean cinema, in particular, seems to rely on eccentricity as to be seen with earlier entries like Oldboy; Snowpiercer is no different because it's filled with awfully peculiar characters. We meet a stoner beyond repair and his daughter who strangely basks in naïveté and childish disposition at the age of 17. Then, there's the strongly neurotic and creepily serene woman (Tilda Swinton), carefully enunciating every word with her animated mouth, who holds command at the second level. Last but not least, Alison Pill portrays an unusually enthusiastic and manipulatively patriotic teacher who looks on at her tragically brainwashed students who all happily repeat her every lecture within an exuberantly bright classroom. As the plot advances, plenty of backstory about these characters and the world they live in is astonishingly revealed, further fleshing out the actual severity of the permanent predicament. I just really hope that enough people check this rare marvel out. Support it because it truly does represent the last shining beacon on cinema's vast landscape in which creativity and audacity is being shaded. Snowpiercer is a fueled action show (blood, shootouts, and sword fighting) that's yet covered with dramatic depth—again so uncompromising and bold in its demeanor, unorthodox in every shape and form from the way it's edited and shot to its continually darkening tone. The little bits and pieces of humor we caught glimpses of in the opening segments are long gone by the time this intensely engrossing tale hits the final act. Instead of showcasing the heroes' gradual progress to success, it takes on a brutally twisted path. Sadly, such a story would never see the light of day in Hollywood's typical studio system, which is solely flooded with crowdpleasers and simplistic, wholly uninspired flicks. I continue to applaud foreign cinema; Joon-ho has just demonstrated ambitious artistry at its finest. I will not forget the way this story developed nor will I forget the way it closed. All in all, Snowpiercer is as mind-blowing and memorable as such types of films come nowadays. As I've said before, I strongly implore all moviegoers to go out and catch a showing of this film at your local movie theater (considering its limited release) once it releases this June 27th.",Snowpiercer
222,tinovalkki,Good but could have been better,7,20 July 2014,"Snowpiercer is one of the best dystopia movies what I have seen lately. Yet it is not a masterpiece. Couple of problems comes to my mind immediately. Movie is way too long and contains lot of vanities that could been cut out from the movie. Some of the train cabins are just vain when people just walk through them. Some of the cabins contain a lot of action and some none, just people to watching them pass by. Also the ending of the film is not surprising enough. Movie feels to run out of steam, when they finally reach the first compartment. Technically movie is beautiful to watch and scenery through train windows are inconsolable gorgeous. Actors are exceptional sterling for low budget movie. Even Chris Evans, normally so log actor makes his role admissible. Tilda Swinton sparkles as a meanie. Overall the movie is better than average dystopia movie even with few falls.",Snowpiercer
223,adaptor,Not worth the time it takes to watch it,3,27 January 2021,"The series does a better job with the material but the material isn't great to begin with. The metaphor is heavy handed with forced symbolism, and the entire premise of a train being the only solution to the problem is ridiculous. There's another movie -- The Platform -- that conveys a similar message, in my opinion, in a far more solid vehicle than this. Snowpiercer, the movie, is watchable but there are many better ways to spend the same amount of time.",Snowpiercer
224,cbnewham,Refreshingly bad,2,22 February 2020,"I'm rather conflicted over the score I'm giving this. On the one hand it is well acted, has good visual effects, and is not a typical Hollywood piece of tripe. On the other hand it is a bizarre mish-mash of scenes with so many plot holes and inconsistencies as to render the film meaningless and empty. I didn't feel compelled to turn the movie off at any point; it's hard to turn away when you are watching a freakish accident unfold.I won't bother to list the countless plot holes, inconsistencies, and plain bizarre things there are in this movie as they are all well documented by others on here. I feel the closest thing there is to this movie is something like Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"". However, while ""Brazil"" is a fairly consistent self-contained dystopian universe which has subtle (and not-so-subtle) comedy sewn through it, ""Snowpiercer"" seemed to swing wildly from trying to be serious through to being a dark comedy. It's as if it was trying to ape Terry Gilliam's work - and interestingly enough there is even a main character named ""Gilliam"".Overall this film is a hodgepodge of ideas that amount to nothing. I'm giving it two stars. I certainly can't understand why it is currently rated as over 7 starts on IMDb.",Snowpiercer
225,tgchan,tgchan says YES!,7,11 September 2014,"www.tgchan.pl Few first minutes and by visuals it reminds me of Metro (games/book) but instead of underground the action happens in a train. After more than 30 minutes, the only thing I can really say that the setting of the movie is quite original and you don't have to wait long for something to happen. 47min - OK I really love the setting of the movie now and the action is intense! The Snowpiercer (2013) deals with an interesting topic about poor vs rich issue in a post apocalyptic world, something similar seen in Elysium (2013), Upside Down (2012) .Movie has lots of bloody surprises awaiting for you with great visuals and stunning story twist at the end of it.There must be a balance everywhere. It's funny because this train reflects our world... it is miniature of our reality and what is happening in it. If we won't stop doing what we do, we will end like the train... When you will watch the movie you should know what I am talking about.Decent story, decent visuals, decent action...I say go for it! It is a nice original movie and you shouldn't be disappointed.tgchan's rating 7.5/10",Snowpiercer
226,bravesfanc,An enjoyable watch,7,4 January 2015,"In a world that has frozen over, the last humans on Earth have been living on a train for the last 17 years. The movie picks up with the group in the back of the train. These people seem to be the lowest on the totem pole and aren't living as comfortably as they would like. In one of the first scenes, you get the sense that these people want to change the way they live. A revolt against the guards is being planned and its only a matter of time before their plan goes into effect.The plot of the movie moves along as the plan goes into effect and the actions that are required by both parties. As our ""hero"" continues further and further to the beginning of the train, we the audience get to learn more about how this train is separated. For example, one cart has a school and the next a dentist followed by what looks like a high class bar.It was an interesting take on the ""end of the world"" so to speak and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I don't think this got a lot of mainstream press but it's now on Netflix for those to enjoy as well. A solid 7/10 for the Sci/Fi thriller.",Snowpiercer
227,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Shockingly bad!,2,13 May 2020,"I gave this film 2 stars because of the cast and overall production values, but please believe me as a human reviewer when I emphasize how bad it is.What really disgusts me is the artificial block reviews giving it 9 or 10 stars, saying absolutely nothing besides ""this was absolutely terrific, go see..."", but you have to examine the low reviews to understand why this film is so dreadful, which unfortunately, most people don't bother to do so because of its 7-star rating and Oscar-winning director.Complete and utter nonsense, which got worse and worse as time went on, magnified by the relentless seriousness of Chris Evans who never let off for a second. If he'd transcended into parody or gone tongue-in-cheek for just a minute, this could have been a different type of film, but as it stands, the film doesn't have the slightest clue what its supposed to be - you try to take it seriously at first, but can't because of how totally ridiculous it is.Saying that, my hat goes off to Tilda Swinton for realizing what a giant dodo the script was and deciding to ham it up instead, and whose stock has risen in my book. And John Hurt and Ed Harris? Just taking a paycheck, I guess.Seriously, this film hit the lows of Battlefield Earth, with Chris Evans equaling the the baffling seriousness of Barry Pepper. Wow, it is so embarrassingly bad.",Snowpiercer
228,bcheng93,...7.5 would be a fair rating because there were some plot holes,7,24 March 2014,"i personally gave this movie an 9 to hopefully boost up the 7.4 rating it currently has on IMDb. most naysayers voting on this were very venomous and gave it only a 1 or a 2. i really don't get that at all, because at worst at worst its a 5-5.5 if the movie was sub-par which it is not.i been hyped to watch this movie for 1/2 a year now. usually i would say that 7 put of 10 times even if the movie was pretty good i still would be not really disappointed but unsatisfied would be the more accurate description. thank goodness this wasn't the case! this was one of the better movies i've watched in a long long time. i had chances to watch bootlegs of this movie and boy! am i g;ad i waited for the blu- ray.i wonder if they showed this movie in theaters in Mainland China??? wow!, this movie was rousing in spots and just stirs the emotion pot and gets it boiling. i know that most reviewers wrote about how it resemble 1984, metropolis, and human caste systems and yadayadayada. just watch the movie for what it is, a really rousing, emotional sci-fi, action movie with good cgi effects.fans of Chris Evans are going to give this movie a 9 i think, because the movie is good already then you add another digit for being an Evans fan, who by the way was really, really good. Chris Evans has got good acting chops. Tilda Swinton is always deliciously, wickedly good, John Hurt was his usual solid self, Kang was solid...it wasn't his best. there were 3 good creepy roles in the movie and one of them was by Ed Harris in one of his best roles, the other one is Harris's minion in this movie played by Alison Pill and the third was the top assassin or killer in the high hierarchy in the bluish gray suit...whats up with him, he don't want to seem to die.this movie would be considered low budget based on American standards but no way does it resemble that. i loved the cgi of the world outside the train and thought it was done very nicely.this movie is definitely getting multiple viewings from me because even though it does have some holes, the story itself is really deep and needs to be analyzed a little bit. for now though, the first few viewings will be just because the movie was so rousing and emotional, there was plenty of action in this movie for the junkies and very, very well done. good solid acting from a wonderful, truly international cast.in other words its got everything a solid blockbuster is suppose to have, plot holes and all...but deeper. Enjoy, with a big E!",Snowpiercer
229,JamesRutland,one of the worst storytelling ever.,1,2 August 2021,Both story telling and direction on this movie are among the worst ever made.

230,rdvljunk,You need to watch it to the end,8,30 November 2015,"When this movie started I lost my hopes very quickly. It looked like yet another ""post-apocalyps the hero wins all"" sort of thing. But I decided to sit it out and more and more the movie showed his hidden aspects and dark, sometimes very dark, humor (happy new year). The basic fighting slowly turned into a quest to meet ""god"", who in the end has some surprises for our hero. The basic idea is of course rationally seen very stupid: an train where how closer you get to the locomotive the more luxurious it becomes , created by a train freak, unendlessly circling the globe in a snow covered landscape, but actually the idea fits the dark and absurd humor.It is certainly not a movie for all, but it's worth watching if you leave out rationality and go into the deeper messages of the movie",Snowpiercer
231,MattBirk,Original Ideas are the Best Ideas,10,14 July 2014,"Bong Joon-ho has created a bizarre, yet captivating world all set within the confines of a single train and in the train he puts diverse characters facing oppression. Snowpiercer is one of the most original movies in years and the director completely knows how to handle the material. The visuals are spectacular, each car within the train is as elegant and lavish as the next, this is obviously one of the best aspects of the movie, we never know what lies beyond the doors to the next car. But do they serve a purpose, are they necessary, or are they nothing more than fancy add-ons for the upper-class members? As they race from the tail of the train to the front where the engine resides, they go through a number of bizarre obstacles which makes for some added unpredictability.Snowpiercer is a brilliant take on the state of current societies across the world and how the government suppresses its people in favor of themselves and those higher up. I can quite confidently say Snowpiercer will be the best movie of the year and another movie to gain a solid following as the years roll by, Sci-Fi fans rejoice!",Snowpiercer

It is a really good action movie, if you like John Wick or Kill Bill you should definitely see this one. Really good action film. 8/10.",Snowpiercer
233,mbhgkmsgg,Snowpiercer,9,5 December 2020,"This is one of those films that I had wanted to see ever since it came out, but for some reason, I never got around to it. Now that I finally did get around to it, I'm glad I did. Snowpiercer is, at its core, a revenge story. However, it's also much more than that.While I'm yet to see Parasite (both directed by Bong Joon-ho), based on what I've heard, it's full of metaphors and imagery that support its message, as is Snowpiercer. I don't know how it is in Parasite, but at least in this movie, they aren't hard to miss. The most obvious is, of course, the train and how it is constructed. At the back, are the dirty and dark and windowless carriages, where the less fortunate live. And as you move forward, towards the engine, the train becomes filled with light and colour and life. It doesn't take much to find a deeper meaning in this setup. While this example is the most obvious one, there are seemingly endless other examples. Nearly every scene and moment seems to hold a deeper meaning, as long as you are willing to look for it. While I'm sure I didn't notice them all, even the ones I did find, would make this review unbearably long.Although the biggest, and the most obvious theme is the difference between the poor and rich, there are some much finer ones to be discovered. One of my favourites was the idea that no matter who you are, or no matter who you think you are, there is always someone else in control. The big twist at the end tells it straight to your face, but hints of it are sprinkled throughout.But it's not just the story that supports these themes and metaphors. I especially loved how the film looked at the beginning and how it changed as the story progressed. At first, it can be almost difficult to see what is going on. As the main character moves through the train, to a seemingly better life, and as he starts to make realizations of what is actually going on, the image also becomes clearer, and it becomes easier to see.As far as the rest of the film goes, it's fantastic. I really like these types of films, so this was right up my alley. In typical Korean style, the action is brutal and honest and leaves nothing to be guessed. But what I loved above all else, was the intensity. Snowpiercer is much more likely to kill some of the main characters off, than others like it. Never knowing who is going to make it through the chaos, certainly had me on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire runtime. Snowpiercer isn't afraid to surprise you either. Although the big reveal at the end might be easy to guess for some, there are a lot of smaller moments throughout, that caught me completely off guard.I'm glad that I finally got around to watching this film. Although I had high expectations, Snowpiercer managed to not only meet them but also exceed them. If you are looking for a solid action flick, this more than meets the requirement. But what makes it stand above so many other action films, is that it manages to really make you think about the world we live in, and any similarities that you might find with the train.",Snowpiercer
234,graham-harvey,"Violent, Horrific, Depressing",2,30 August 2021,"If negative visions of the future are your thing, you will love this film. Personally, any film that dims hope about a future world, is something to be avoided. But what really turns me off is excessive violence. It may establish the story as one of horror & brutality, but on such scenes, I prefer to skip. This film is built on stereotype after stereotype, probably appealing to people who want grunt, the kind of Trumpian character who does not think too deeply, and wants to categorise people into good & bad. What also establishes this film as muck is the implausibility. If all life has ceased because of this so called super freeze, why would the only life continuing be on a train! That would be the first of the vehicles to fail! This film is muck & will leave a feeling of sadness, that humans would be so mean & nasty to one another.

235,horizon2008,Loved it (minor spoilers).,9,21 March 2014,"Wow! I don't know how this one passed me by but I hadn't even heard of Snowpiercer. In a word, it's fantastic.In a future world, global warming has got to disastrous levels so a chemical is sprayed into the atmosphere to lower the temperatures. Unfortunately, this causes a horrific global freeze, killing everyone except those crammed aboard a massive, perpetual motion train (ok, you have to really suspend your belief for that part as perpetual motion is impossible) and a class society has been established where the poor live at the back, and the rich live at the front. Snowpiercer is from the director of the Korean flick The Host (not that garbage from last year, the great 2006 movie). And it's truly an amazing experience. I don't want to give too much away, but rebellion is afoot, and each carriage holds new perils as those at the tail end make their way to the front. One coach in particular has some juicy violence in store which could only come from an Asian director like this. It was good to see Chris Evans in a film which isn't the usual Hollywood churn out (I'm no fan of Captain America sadly). And the movie, without doubt, has all the hallmarks of an Asian production. There are many elements to the story, and it never lets up from start to finish. No padding, no stupid love interest, and while I would have liked it even more violent and gory (there was plenty of opportunity for this) I guess they were going for a large audience (though it seems it was an R in the USA). As a Sci-Fi movie it's top notch, and things like where the food comes from, or who works the train is all revealed as we go along. Along with the equally excellent ""The Flu"" movie, this is one of the best films I've seen so far this year.",Snowpiercer
236,joshuafagan-64214,Legimately Fascinating,8,16 September 2016,"I've always wanted to see a dystopian film set on a train. Not only did I get one, it ended up being one of the most creative and thoughtful films of 2014.Most dystopian films- whatever their type or quality- are set in open, vast areas. There is a lot of space for the characters to run around and interact with their environment. This film flips the switch. The characters still get to interact with their environment, but there is a sense of claustrophobia that hangs over every second of the film.The physical distance covered by the characters in this film is large- and it feels even larger than it is thanks to the diversity present in the art direction, which every car looking and feeling fundamentally different than every other car, which by the way is also the reason why six small subworlds feel larger than one large, boring desert world, a truth game developers seem to have forgotten these days- but it is covered in cramped quarters. Any film in which the heroes' primary objective involves having to navigate through a structure owned by the villain is bound to be tense, but in those films, there is usually at least one big, wide area, like a dungeon or hangar. This film, by virtue of taking place on a train, has no such open area.You'd think that such a film would feel linear and uninteresting even with the superior art direction. You'd be wrong. While the film does feel like a video game at times- particularly in one section where the heroes open a door and are suddenly faced with about fifty guards- it feels like a good, strong, interesting video game, the kind you never get tired of. While the character work is nothing exemplary, it is more than good enough for this kind of a film, and more than good enough to film feel alive, like it has a beating heart.The difference between a trip and a journey is that a trip simply takes your body from one place to another, while a trip takes your mind and spirit too. To go back to the video game example, almost all early games- and a good amount of later games- leave you with a sense of emptiness as you explore. You're just going on a trip, not a journey. It does not feel like that at all in this film. The gravity of the situation is apparent on the characters' faces. Chris Evans, who plays Curtis, our lead, is not exactly Marlon Brando, but when a director can get a good performance out of him, it's a good performance because you can tell his entire life's history is informing on the actions he takes.That's why he makes a good Captain America, and that's why he's good in this film. He has been stuck on this train since he was 17. He's thirty-four now. Snowpiercer is a film that takes place on a snowball Earth that happened 17 years ago. Curtis and some others managed to get out, but they were treated like scum. He has seen multiple revolutions rise and fall. The events of this film are the culmination of his struggle, and they feel like it. That's what makes dystopian works effective; it's not so much the dystopia itself, but rather how it affects the characters.That brings me to the biggest triumph of this film: it is taps into everything that makes dystopian movies work while avoiding cliché and tedium around every corner. In an America that was drowning in Hunger Games ripoff, this South Korean-Czech production based off a French novel (yes, that's weird, and it shows) gave us exactly what we needed.This is not to say the film is perfect though. There are a lot of things that don't make sense and twists that fall flat. Whenever it tries to be deep and existential, talking about fate and destiny, it comes off as confused, likely as much of anything because of the differences between Western and Eastern views of this topic.I wish the character interactions were as detailed and interesting as the technical aspects of the flick. Aside for an astonishingly good revelation scene outside the engine room, these characters don't really pour themselves out to one another. The most emotionally invested I felt was during a (really impressive) battle scene at the end of the first act.If you're a nitpicker, you might want to skip this one. But if you're someone like me, someone who appreciates film as a living, breathing art form, and prioritizes ideas and concepts and performances over little problems that don't affect the overall quality of the film, you'll enjoy this one for what it is. If nothing else, it's certainly a cure for formulaic dystopian flicks.",Snowpiercer
237,Dello_,An American-south Korean post apocalyptic film,9,6 March 2020,"""Snowpiercer"" is a movie that explores some themes regarding social life and classes, showing the fight between the regime that has the power in the train and the lower classes that are poorly treated by the regime itself. The themes are interesting and the answers are not definitive but I won't go further in order not to spoil anything. The movie is well directed and has great visuals, an interesting premise and an excellent cast. The plot kept me hooked and there were three or four instances where it hit me. The film never bored me and instead it kept me on the edge of my seat for the majority of its duration. If you have the chance to watch ""Snowpiercer"" do it.",Snowpiercer
238,DonaldDooD,What!?,5,21 July 2014,"My expectations going in were quite high. Reviewers I trust had nothing but praise for the film, and it had over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Little did I know that Snowpiercer is one of the most ridiculous, poorly-written films of the year, not even counting the impossible premise.The film had potential to be a new sci-fi classic. The setting is completely unique, and the effects portray it perfectly. No effort was wasted in creating the train's claustrophobic atmosphere, and each section offers new insight to the train's functions and culture. Once in awhile, you can even see glimpses of intelligence in the action and dialog.But 5 minutes couldn't pass without a distracting attempt at humor, edge, or just plain incompetence. Some exaggeration was done intentionally, derailing the serious tone and message. More importantly, the direction and writing falter dozens of times. An important plot point is opened, but ultimately dropped forever. Characters on both sides switch from meticulous and clever to reactive/passive meatheads. Some characters are three dimensional, others are only caricatures. The depravity and inequality on the train was so severe, I was laughing at the most serious moment of the film!People are actually talking about Snowpiercer's commentary on economic division? Why?! Wilfred's caste system is pure madness, especially in the context of a post-apocalyptic world. There is no benefit for creating a class structure, nor does it mirror capitalist societies, since only a handful of people in any class do any work! The only people who think this film is deep are the ones who already agree with the message. Its contrived and amped up beyond acceptable satire.If this film were less well-made, more controlled, or less stupid, it would be awful. But this film is so nuts that it really is one of the best movies you can have for Bad Movie Night. Its misplaced ambition makes it a blast to riff with a group of friends. Hence 5 stars instead of 3 or 4.When we reached the final shot of the film, I was hysterical, slamming my fist into the couch. I can't believe people can take this film seriously. It makes a great double feature with Winter's Tale or The Fifth Element. As a fun bad movie, its one of the best - but dear God this is not the next 2001!",Snowpiercer
239,n-mo,This is one that stays with you,8,13 November 2013,"Apart from a couple of bad CGI shots, there is very little to critique, technically, with this film. The premise is highly interesting; the cinematography is very good, if not particularly spectacular or eye- catching; the acting and directing are fantastic; the plot is gripping; the script is well-written and the characters surprisingly believable. Points also to the director for managing to take the thriller - a notoriously and rabidly conservative/reactionary (if banally so) genre - and succeed in turning out a thoroughly Marxist product.Of course, as a conservative/reactionary myself, I'm not about to let this slip by without a word or two about the film's politics. The film is, as mentioned, unabashedly Marxist, though at the same time too cynical and not cynical enough. Resources are scarce and we can't provide for everyone? No problem: we'll just launch a nice Holodomor/nuclear war (which is exactly what they do at the end). Socialist fairy tales of old had all the people living happily ever after; postmodern tales of despair has everyone die off. In this one, the few survivors of the Stalinian crime get to live happily ever after.The film is also extremely racist. On one level, this was intentional: the train carrying the survivors of humanity sports specimens of all phenotypes, but in the end, the only white survivor is a polar bear, and the only human survivors are an Asian female and a black male. Clearly, according to this film, the future 1. belongs to Asians and Africans; the West can move over, and 2. involves heavy miscegenation. (But thank God we've cleansed the world of those awful white people genes!)At the same time, on a more subtle level, the film is white supremacist to a degree that would make a Ku Klux Klansman blush. For the Asian and African survivors were guided along the way by their white enablers, who protected them, retrieved them, and taught them everything they needed to know to survive. Even the Asian technical genius in this film could never have pulled his redemptive stunt without his white C.E.O. Do the terms ""White Man's Burden"" and ""Little Brown Brother"" ring a bell? Of course this is a reflection of the fact that the modern leftist is simply a different kind of bigot from his early twentieth-century eugenicist counterpart: rather than wanting to exterminate all the brown people, he wants to make them all Just Like Us: sexually libertine, materially prosperous, deracinated hedonists going about ""our own business.""A truly fascinating piece that I can't get out of my head. A very serious work of cinema that deserves attention.",Snowpiercer
240,sjarja,memorable,9,10 January 2015,"Saying that this film is a good time or great fun does not quite fit. It is one of the rare films that make you think about its characters - because you care.The Protagonist offers many interesting layers of personality with very little actual dialog, the Antagonist is a man that you can - in a twisted way - relate to. Although the whole social system of the train makes little sense ( doubt it is meant to make any sense in a realistic way ) - it is a great showcase of society without forcing it on the viewer... too much.There are many influences i can see or feel in that movie. There is Rapture (Bioshock), there is Brazil, there is Jules Verne - and probably others, too.What i admired about the movie was that it was not the typical Hollywood ""compromise"" ending; but uncompromising consequential. In the end - I - as a viewer did not know who or what to root for - for each choice, each action was a bad one.Other than a very good - if surreal story - it offered very good acting and pacing. - 2 memorable hours more than worth the money.",Snowpiercer

But being unique does not necessary mean this movie is a good thing. There is a good pace to this movie, lots of good action and a twist. However the setting is just too unique to be believable as there are many questions raised about the method of survival and reasons why the train has to keep moving. However the union of Hollywood/Korean movie studios left one confused and dysfunctional movie baby. I found the Korean actors were just weird and their performance and part in the story was a big distraction. Some of the scenes also did not make sense like the one with the soldiers with meat cleavers and fish?? Dance Carriage?? you mean they dance all the time?? Super human bad guys who act like Terminator? And ultimately the climax of the movie just leaves you staying what I said at the start WhAt ThE *%# !!!!!",Snowpiercer

244,YJLcool,A highly recommended sci-fi action drama with intriguing concepts,8,1 March 2014,"Based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob & Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette, Snowpiercer is an intriguing, compelling, thought-provoking and intense South Korean sci-fi action drama film with credible English-speaking casts: Chris Evans (Captain America), Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot), John Hurt (V for Vendetta), Tilda Swinton (Narnia), Ed Harris (The Truman Show) and so on.The film sets in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world where a global- warming solution has gone horribly wrong, plunging the world into another ice age, killing off most life on the planet. The only survivors are left endlessly travelling around the globe in a super-train powered by a perpetual-motion engine that never stops. Over time, a class system was formed with the elites inhabiting the front of the train and poor inhabiting the back of the train. A revolution starts to happen with an attempt to seize control of the engine.The film succeeds on so many levels: attention to characters, fantastic world-building concepts, stunning visuals, good pacing, avoidance of melodrama (normally found in many Korean films), the unexpected turn of events and a surprising twist near the end of the film. Above all, this film highly respects the audience's intelligence by allowing them to sit and follow through the 'presentation' with meaningful 'breadcrumbs' along the way, instead of delivering everything on a silver platter.As the film progresses, it carefully examines the social class system formed in the train, from the most basic labour working class, right up to the elite, in perfect order. As the revolution starts from the back end to the front end of the train, each successive car reveals a shocking aspect of this grotesque, self-sustaining socio-economic system...We get to see the evolution of civilisation from simple beginnings to science, education, quality, luxury, then hedonism, extravagance and eventual demise, in an exact order. It reflects the various aspects of our current society from within, provide great insights about the nature of humanity. Snowpiercer is filled with stylistic gritty violence as the brutality of the elites against the low-class commoners are shown vividly in the film.This film is definitely better than many of the similar-themed films like Elysium or In Time. I would highly recommend anyone to watch it.Rating: 8.5/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-snowpiercer.html",Snowpiercer

246,iwatchibinge,It is not as bad as Parasite.,7,29 April 2020,"Again a movie on divided classes amongst humans yada yada especially during the apocalypse. Bong Joon-ho seems to be obsessed with class divided subject. But atleast this one was more entertaining than Oscar winning Parasite.
Two drawbacks though, movie length and plot holes. Could have been atleast 15-20 mins shorter but cinematography can excuse this one. And there have been so many plot holes already listed in other reviews, but one which bothered me most was how can a baby (Edgar) on train who grew up without his mother have an accent?!! There is no reason for this one to be missed out apart from gross lethargy of writer/director (who is same for the movie).",Snowpiercer
247,uncsbuddy91,Worth it,7,18 June 2020,"So, I gave it a 7 because the acting was great, the concepts were cool, and the socio-economic hierarchy was very realistic.

For the ones who'd want to check it out and dont mind a dark violent social commentary this is a treat. Good cast, good acting (Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton are a highlight), good action and relentless pace. Probably most are familiar with the story of snowpiercer, the train that holds the last of humans and keeps going around the world, while its people are split in sections in the train. That story itself constitutes a great -but not new- metaphor about society. I would keep the metaphor in the background as the backbone of the story and focus on the other exciting elements of the film, which are very rewarding. Good film, 8/10",Snowpiercer

251,borismk-38942,Misunderstood Masterpiece,9,28 April 2020,"People seem to fixate on different things in this movie. They complain about the science or praise the obvious class struggle commentary of the film. Both of these perspectives completely miss the point.There is social commentary in this film, but it's far more complicated than ""rich people bad"". Like any good post-apocalyptic film the central theme is really about what people will do to survive, and whether we still deserve to live after what we've done.Both the front and the tail passengers participate in horrific things to sustain the lives they have. The behaviour of the various characters, from the bizarre, to the villanous and the tragic, reflects the psychological trauma of continued living in the only world they have left (however insane it is). In the end the whole film is a giant representation of the moral choice dillemna.People getting annoyed at the realism should probably stick to documentaries. The people in their circumstances feel real, and that's more than enough",Snowpiercer

Now while this movie is in no way perfect, it does its job on the entertainment level, & does not take itself too seriously (playing ""Strange Brew"" when they are about to find out what's in their protein bars) & the apparent genius of the Kronol addict even has some witty lines. I think anyone watching this should not take it too seriously either. It's a just piece of decent escapist entertainment! I have always been a massive fan of John Hurt (God rest him peacefully x) & although his role in this is not that big, his character has a big impact on the plot & his acting is perfection. I love Tilda Swinton also, & as Mason she delivers a creepy unhinged & yet flawless performance. The school room scene echos social justice ""Global Citizen"" education in some countries today but the level of violence in the film is occasionally OTT. It's also dark & moody even art house in places but the direction is good as is the editing. The revolution scenes are reminiscent of the pitch forks & torches of the French Revolution, but the occasional switching to slow motion does get a bit tiring. The story does have its plot holes & I feel the back story was not explained properly (How did the United Nations decide to fire missiles to help climate change?) A developed back story would have been very interesting raising the questions of a prequel? Anyway there is an upcoming TV series ""Snowpiecer"" to be released this year, which I am looking forward too. Well, this movie is certainly not good, but it's certainly not bad either.",Snowpiercer

I bet this one is just that.I'd known nothing of this story prior to seeing the film so I'm not sure if it was an advantage or disadvantage, however either way, I found myself carried along for the ride in suspense and wonder of what the next turn would bring. And how a film can place you on a train yet throughout still capture your every minute with such a grip, was quite surprising to me. A Pleasant surprise indeed.

256,stephenlovelette,Metaphor and Fights Galore.,8,4 August 2014,"Dystopian societies are hip.So are post-apocalyptic civilizations.It's rare to find them together without robots, space travel or undead.Snowpiercer is based off a French sci-fi graphic novel, Le Transperceneige, which colloquially translates to ""The Train of the Snow Land.""And boy is it fun.It's available for HD Rental through iTunes and Amazon for $6.99, or a dollar more through Xfinity OnDemand.This is South Korean director Joon-ho Bong's third film. Mother was released in 2009 after his creature feature The Host from 2006. Which, as far as subtitled scary movies go, is not a bad film.Unless foreign horror's your wheelhouse, you can skip The Host, and move right along to Snowpiercer.It's Bong's first English-speaking film, and although this is clear at times, it's a remarkable experience.Set entirely on a train circumventing the world, this post-doomsday thriller is riveting, intelligent and visually stunning.Chris Evans is good as the protagonist. He's catching a lot of critical flack for his performance. There's a moment late in the movie where he delivers an emotional line that's a bit jarring.Perhaps a superior actor could have delivered the dialogue better. I'd argue it wasn't strong writing in the first place.Other than that, Chris gets the job done.The characters encounter quite a bit of combat, all of which involve intricate physical procedures. Between the battleship in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the blade car in Snowpiercer, Chris plays the centerpiece in two of the finest fights in cinematic history. And they were released within three months of each other.When it comes to action sequences, the director does everything right. He utilizes long takes, different camera lenses, varied setting features, drastic changes in momentum, realistic physical contact, slow motion (there's an outstanding sequence in which Evans dispatches several thugs with a felling axe), martial arts, weaponry, tag-teaming. The list goes on and on.The supporting cast is great as well.Jamie Bell, who you know from Billy Elliot, turns in a solid performance as the jokester best friend.Upon reaching the classroom car, the schoolteacher's played by Alison Pill. She, like Tilda Swinton, performs a quirksome role. Their characters are odd (in different ways) but the actresses pull it off.Bong's got Octavia Spencer pounding dudes with body shots, with fists and a piece of metal pipe on-screen!It's just delightful.If you dig fights, Snowpiercer's the flick to rent.That being said, I think the ladies won't like this as much. The story is thoroughly bleak and imperfect.In fact, I agree with much of what the critics are saying. The boundary between reality and metaphor is blurry to the point of confusion.The narrative's allegorical which makes it difficult to connect with the characters on a human level.Events unfold in a manner that feels more orchestrated than organic.Despite its imperfection, the story is still thrilling and sweeps you up.Just like the animated sequence describing the rail's creation, this movie's full of style.This tendency doesn't continue after the ending, though. So you can shut the movie off once the credits start to roll.After reading up and carving thru all the confusion, the ending's a tad bit dissatisfying. My buddy fell asleep, and I'm still not in love with it.As a final note, there is an aspect of this story I find gross.People respond to the grotesque in four ways: 1) Revulsion 2) Silent Distaste 3) Cool Indifference 4) Embracement.I'm weak in this area. I'm a 2 but would rather be a 3, like my friend who watched Snowpiercer with me.It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But my buddy disagrees.We both agree, however, it's totally worth the ride along the way.So to the 1's I suggest caution.To the 2's I say, ""Power through, compadres.""To the 3's, keep chilling.And to the 4's, God help you.",Snowpiercer

258,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Snowpiercer,8,11 December 2013,"First off, I love the international cast. This is the type of international co-production that I like to see more of in the future. Considering the somber heavy tone of the story, it's surprising that this movie was even made. Every actor fits their part and they all happen to be character actors in an ensemble piece.Chris Evans makes an engaging lead, never letting his stardom get in the way of his character. Watching him play such a righteous character never once reminded me of Captain America, and that's probably the best thing I can say. Tilda Swinton is wonderfully ridiculous. When she first appeared, it threw me off because it was so over-the-top. Her character seemed to belong in another film. I wondered if it was possible for someone like that to exist in that environment but as the story unfolded, Swinton's commitment to her cartoonish portrayal changed my opinion.Song Kang-Ho is always an entertaining presence. He is held back by a language barrier but that is not enough to contain his natural funniness. Jamie Bell and Octavia Spencer both make a dramatic impact with their supporting roles. Alison Pill also has a memorable cameo that teeters between creepy and satirically hilarious.Bong Joon-Ho tells a good proper social science fiction story. The metaphor of the train representing the hierarchy of social class was handled with subtlety. This could vary for other viewers, but the film's ideas and themes never felt heavy for me. As the lower class move up each train car in a series of action set pieces, I found myself slowly detaching from what was going on and comfortably sinking into the film's ideas (a problem I had with Edgar Wright's The World's End earlier this year). The story's themes brought me back to the time when I read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's Animal Farm in high school. I thought about human nature, social class and the rich versus the poor, but never for too long because the characters were about to discover what's in the next train car. The middle portion of the film does sag a bit, but Bong Joon-Ho delivers some nice twists and turns along the way.I read the news about the Weinstein Company is trying to cut a shorter version of Snowpiercer for its upcoming American release. Even thinking in Harvey Weinstein's terms (and believe me, witnessing the amount of Asian cinema has neutered by Weinstein for the last decade, I consider myself an expert), I don't see what he thinks Americans won't understand about the social politics and story in Snowpiercer.The only commercial concern that I can think of is the Korean language portions of the film because American audiences apparently dislike reading subtitles. Korean only takes up a small portion of the film. And actually, an universal translating device is aptly written into film for audiences that prefer to listen. That or Weinstein just wants to put down his authorial stamp for unearthing Asian cinema to the West. So don't be patronized, if it's available, please go see the original director's version. It's solid science fiction made with proper intentions by a cast and crew that are passionate about the material.",Snowpiercer
259,drmuhammedsamiduru,History consists of repetition.,8,23 May 2020,"Yes ... I can say that it was a good movie with its script, event flow and actors. When we look at the film technically and generally, we see how the world fits into a train. Both with the upper and lower conflict between people, with the conscience and mind conflict... Everyone said that the end was meaningless and bad, but I think it was a possible end when the end was considered very meaningful and logical. When we look at it from a logical point of view (if we look at it from the point of view of the movie), the female human species, one of whom is a white, slanting-eyed woman in the world; the other remains a male and black male species that is younger than him. So probably humanity will continue to live. Also, the polar bear detail is a big factor in this. As far as we have observed, the polar bear is very healthy and takes the nutrients it needs for its body. If we consider a food chain where the bear feeds on fish, fish on other creatures on the water, and creatures on the water for different creatures, it means that the Earth will correct itself over time, these two people will be able to access their food source and maintain their ancestry. On the other hand, assuming that nothing technological, man-made is left, history will be rewritten starting from the age of the cave (based on the history books taught in our schools to date).History consists of repetition.",Snowpiercer
260,aldri-feb,Stunning and entertaining enough,8,22 November 2013,"'Snowpiercer' is an ambitious and serious movie about situation after end of the world. The storyline isn't original actually, it could be inspired by Noah who built a big boat to avoid doomsday while 'Snowpiercer' is in the train. From start till the end of the movie is about group of people from tail section who is commanded by Curtis want to rebel and go through the front section to kill Wilford (the train maker) after injustice they've received for many years. 'Snowpiercer' is undeniably fun and visually stunning. The film shows brutality which is interesting to see. Some scenes really tense and thrilling especially when they have war against soldiers, it's an unbelievable experience. Perhaps there are some things isn't explained more detail and lacks humanity but it doesn't bother the plot in it. Bong Joon Ho takes his responsibility on international debut really well although 'Snowpiercer' is still below from his best, I think it will open an opportunity for him to create more visionary movies in Hollywood industry.",Snowpiercer

The story was Awesome and the fact that the whole movie takes place on a train made it even cooler and that they could have so many different scenery locations for a train was breathtaking. The actors all did a fantastic job and Chris Evans was terrific but the supporting cast was stellar.I will say the best part in my opinion was the action it was top-notch and full throttle throughout and yes there is a lot of talking but when the action arrives it is some of the best I have seen in years and to be honest I would recommend this movie to anyone.

There are some problems here, storyline issues that never quite make sense, especially. But in some aspects it comes across as a well made movie. You certainly cannot rate it up for being clean and wholesome and truly worthwhile. I shouldn't have been watching a show meant to explore the worst of people, hello depression. But I did really appreciate seeing Evans in this. It really showed his Talent and range, beyond just saying, ""I like him!""",Snowpiercer
263,shinsrevenge,(Don't) be a shoe!,10,14 February 2016,"""A shoe belongs on the foot, not on the head."" This quote from the movie prepares you for what is to come. When I read the story about a train with the last survivors of mankind in a frozen, post-apocalyptic world, this isn't nearly what I expected to see. Or hear, for that matter.Especially not after the good intro and the first minutes. The story goes as follows: The poor people of the train are treated bad by soldiers and their superiors. They tried to revolt a couple of times in the past, but always failed. This time they fight their way towards the front of the train while having to face crazy, axe-wielding guardians and slippery fishes on the floor. And just when you think it can't get any sillier, a man announces that they are about to cross a bridge. So the remaining, wounded and bleeding guardians start a countdown and then happily shout ""happy new year!"".Violence, comedy and a basically good story are a weird combination. But it works surprisingly well. After about half the movie the pace changes though. The plot gets a lot more serious. No more fooling around. So for me ""Snowpiercer"" reaches the full potential by that point and finishes in an overwhelming, deep ending full of strong dialogues.Excellent work. 10/10",Snowpiercer

266,~AleXa~,"Piercing, poignant, and provocative",8,26 July 2015,"Piercing, poignant, and provocative, this movie does not fail to disappoint. It primarily examines classicism and how we define humanity in a dystopian society in a post-apocalyptic world, and while that seems repugnant and boring on the cuff, Joon-ho Bong's direction and the well-adapted screenplay in combination with the riveting performances breathe life into a seemingly stale premise. This feat is all the more impressive considering this is Bong's first English film.Based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige, written by Jean-Marc Rochette, the premise is simple enough on the surface The Rattling Arc bears humanity's last survivors after the government attempted to counteract global warming by dispersing a chemical agent into the atmosphere in 2031. We pick up on the Wilford train some 17 years later.Curtis (Evans), albeit reluctantly, leads the revolution of the upper class at the behest of the train's elder to guide the group. He briefly references earlier in the film the fact that he doesn't deem himself worthy 'with two arms'. In a later retelling of how he met the elder in what is easily the most moving scene in the film, we finally understand the gravity of the burden he bears, which lends credibility to his actions in the end. It is truly heart-wrenching to watch as he describes the atrocity, and Evans does not fail to turn in an emotional performance. The production team does a wonderful job making him look more weathered and sleep-deprived as time progresses, and by the end, you can see and feel his anguish and frustration.The characters are thoroughly fleshed out, each serving a clear purpose. The attention to detail is apparent right from the start. The credit sequence is artistic, appearing as if trains are passing in front of the titles with faint snow falling behind. The cinematography provides a very palpable aesthetic, the dark and gritty tone truly engrossing the audience as if we are but another occupant of the endless train. The score and imagery were beautiful, always lending a touch of tension and mild claustrophobia.I found the allegory between the train and the world particularly poignant. The film submits an interesting look at what it means to be human—how we're defined by the choices we make, and that even when options are limited and the odds seem impossible, there is always a choice. Curtis is faced with two pivotal choices at certain arcs in the film, the first between the life of a friend and the cause, and the other ironically between the endless train and humanity. We are presented with an interesting dichotomy in which despite the fact that you feel as though you know him, it was still never clear which path he would choose, succeeding in keeping you on the edge of your seat until the bitter end.The most provocative theme explored is that even balance can be the wrong choice, cold and inhumane in the darkest sense. Survival can never be the only cause, and so you watch the inevitable downfall of society when balance when unjust leads to imbalance and consequentially demise. My only criticism would be who survives in the end and perhaps a clearer path toward the possibility of recovering some of the old world. That being said, I am thoroughly impressed with the screenplay and the acting, particularly from Chris Evans and Octavia Spencer. I found myself captivated, enjoying the journey every step of the way despite the weight of the hard choices that befell them that we all secretly hope we will never face. The scene in the end when he finally faces Wilford who reveals the elder was complicit in the scheme serves as a poignant reminder to never follow blindly—never be afraid to question and evaluate, and trust your instincts more than the words of others.Don't get me wrong—the film is not perfect by any means. It still falls victim to plot holes and underdevelopment. For starters, why did they have to revert to cannibalism in the beginning, only to be given protein bars later? Were they content to allow the lower class kill each other as another means of population control? And to that end, if Curtis had to eat babies, why would he be so disgusted with the idea of an insectoid protein bar? Second, planned riots seem an ineffective and unpredictable way to control the masses, despite the fact that the incidence of quelled riots would seemingly prevent future ones. Third, it seems highly improbably that there has never been a situation to stop the train or mend the rail in such a harsh climate in 18 years. And lastly, did we really need the henchman to come back from the dead to add more antagonism to the end? Not so much.Like most things in this film, they are open to interpretation—I think that's the point. The filmmakers are asking us to think outside of the box, to expand our minds beyond what seems obvious or simple, because it is rarely so. I do believe there are causes to some of the issues other users have brought up. To quote another user (ole-kris-Ian), what does the engine run on—hopes and dreams? We can see it and are in awe of the engineering marvel, but are never told how it can run incessantly, although I personally think this omission is intentional. The themes in the film are to be the focus, not the mechanics of the train, rendering the answer itself irrelevant.FINAL VERDICT: Overall, Snowpiercer is a beautiful cinematic piece representing a microcosm of society, asking us to define humanity and balance, and reminding us we must always think for ourselves, never allowing us to become pawns in someone else's game. The artistic style and fluid pace open you up to go on a journey you don't quite expect, finding yourself pleasantly surprised once you reach your final destination. Well done.8.0 of 10.0",Snowpiercer
267,axapvov,Fascist allegory successfully covers close to every single cliché in the book,6,19 December 2017,"I don´t want to discuss if being on a train it´s original or dumb. It is what it is. That allows to unfold each wagon´s calamities or luxuries like theatre settings, one at a time, and they all add up to the big picture of society´s inequality. I personally think there is a middle class missing, but whatever... It powerfully conveys a claustrophobic feeling. Everyone is trapped inside. It really seems like an inescapable world where fate must be accepted and revolution is unlikely to succeed. That´s about it, from that point on the journey doesn´t follow any kind of logic. The odds are conveniently manipulated with over-powered enemies or events and its mechanisms are too obvious to feel anything. The sense of danger isn´t really well managed and the one scene where it´s actually there, it all goes away for no reason, just because it says so in the script.The same happens with characters, actions, twists and discoveries, they´re all extremely familiar, even the running time when they happen seems part of the oldest formula of all. We have the injustice, the slaughter, the sacrifice, the fighting one, the selfish one, the chatterbox, the loving one, the reluctant hero, the wise old man, the odious b**ch, the threadbare boss... I could go on. It seems like the fact of it taking place on a train should be enough for everything else to feel fresh.Classic ohs and ahs, which is fine, and John Hurt and Tilda Swinton dignify the tale. It can be good fun if you take it as some sort of allegorical fairytale. The problem is the film does think it is way more meaningful than that. Not only that, it doesn´t even care to add any legit argument against the fascists moral attrocities, other than ""I don´t wanna"". Although that might be more than enough now that I think of it.",Snowpiercer
268,john32935,Too many flaws to accept the premise,4,25 February 2015,"The action scenes in the movie are well shot. The acting is above par. The cinematography is well-done. The dialog is passable. So why do I not like this movie? While I do not mind suspending disbelief in many films, this one required such a stretch of imagination that the entire movie falls apart because I could not accept the flaws of logic in the basic concept of the movie.The below contains some spoilers but they are essential to the critique.First, it is extremely doubtful that the man-made ice age created in this movie would happen overnight. So the viewer is expected to believe that no other efforts succeeded to save anyone other than the few human and animal survivors on this train. That is a huge leap to undertake.Second, the ""mad man"" who created the train chose this form of a ""Noah's Ark"" rather than more stable, sustainable form like a building which would be subject to far less energy requirements and risks. This choice is rationalized by a few moments of film of his childhood stating his love of trains. Really, that is all it took? Not to mention that the train has been traveling non-stop for 18 years without any explanation of this unbelievable perpetual motion engine at the heart of it.Third, as the survivors of the train wreck emerge into the frozen world after 18 years, they see life on the planet has re-emerged in the form of a polar bear. I can forgive misplacing a polar bear into what appears to be the Alps, but a higher form of life like this would require lifeforms lower on the food chain to have survived too. And there is no evidence that this frozen Earth has any such other life. So how did a polar bear survive?These are just some of the many flaws that I could not overlook and why I cannot recommend this movie.To view my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",Snowpiercer
269,verminhater,"Lame, ridiculous and illogical",3,31 March 2014,"Very disappointed would be a good summation for this film especially considering it's early rating here. Once the review process has exhausted the fans and people who haven't seen or heard of the comic are reviewing it I expect it'll fall like a stone.The major flaws as I see them (spoiler alert!). The whole concept of a train being the last salvation of mankind on a frozen planet is just beyond belief. Where does the train stop for servicing to it's undercarriage etc. without any stations? Who maintains the track? An engine that runs on magic as much as anything! Why not make it nuclear or at least something believable. If you were to set up a society in a closed environment why wouldn't everyone have a purpose with controlled breeding rather than be lugging around many people with no contribution to the whole. Why would you engineer a rebellion to control population? There are many better ways. Why would you expect some rebel to want your top job doing things your way? The very word rebel suggests that a change of system is wanted.Major flaws aside there are other issues with the film. The characters are not believable. They belong in the comic it's based on. Nobody has made any effort to translate them to film or realised that some adjustments are even necessary. Film requires a different approach and nobody who made this film understands that. A great example of how to do it right is Dredd. This is a great example of how to do it wrong. The film tries to open up great philosophical issues but fails to do so due to the setting they are working in, ie a comic book. You continuously think that none of this is real and so pay no attention to the great moral dilemmas they are trying to foist on you. It's akin to being lectured by a 10 year old.On top of the major flaws there are many minor ones. I'll just give the one example of the hero of the piece stuffing his arm in a moving machine to save one child (didn't bother to look for anything better suited to the task such as a steel bar) whilst then dooming that child to death with everyone-else.The one redeeming quality of the film is it's well made. It's not remotely enough to save it from being a turkey though.",Snowpiercer
270,Web_Of_Doom,The linear storyline because more off track to its destination!,3,16 January 2021,"The linear storyline because more off track to its destination, as this movie tries so very hard to be clever, thought provoking & a reflection on the modern world... however the reality is the storyline does not make sense on many occasions plus becomes more & more frustrating ( irritating to put up with ) as in trying to be more than it should it loses all sense of believability a movie like this could ever have.
I've seen all the many ""movie concepts"" that appear here in snowpiercer ( 2013 ) before done much much better in some other movies, that know their limitations.
This movie tries to be too many things & ends up detailed by a poor storyline.
I gave this movie 3 stars simply because the actors in the movie were all very professional & did their best to tell this ( ridiculous ) story to the best of their ability plus the visual effects in the movie were good. Director needed to either have a much better ( believable ) script or have the power to make it all make sense.

271,Megan_Shida,A Bong Joon Ho Movie Without Character Development?,6,7 April 2020,"If you just like action and post apocalyptic stuff then this might be for you! If so, stop reading this review and go enjoy a movie that will look similar to other Hollywood action movies you like, albeit with some strange and eccentric moments. If you are looking for a Bong Joon Ho or a deep or thoughtful movie, then you will be surprised at what you see. While there are some interesting shots and some eccentric storytelling, as previously mentioned, there is almost none of the rich and compelling exposition and character development that make the other director's movies great. If you're a fan of sci-fi, you will also see the ending coming from a million miles away because the film really does borrow some plot elements generously from films like Logan's Run and Soylent Green. That being said, it is an entertaining movie and you might like it. There are some genuinely enjoyable parts of this movie, it's just not a particularly deep and you probably will forget it quickly.",Snowpiercer
272,lhunt-9,Allegory presented as science fiction... and succeeding,7,24 October 2014,"Snowpiercer is clearly brilliant, though also weird, and fascinatingly and effectively international, which is a very nice twist. I'm pretty sure it's meant as an allegory of the class system and the corresponding obstacles to mobility between classes (as represented all too transparently by sections of the train). It's also meant to have the feel of a graphic novel, and it easily pulls that off... you could think of many scenes also as ""panels."" Now, you might ask, what does a train that never stops moving have to do with the environmental apocalypse? Well, it's a thin line of reasoning, but the idea is that the train was set up by a visionary as a self-contained, sustainable ecosystem, and... he just happened also to like trains that travel all the way around the world once a year (without track maintenance staff?). Yeah. You can ONLY read it as an allegory. But the acting and character development is outstanding, as are the visuals, the pacing, etc. It's also nice to see the work by a Korean director with quite a few Korean actors. And while Snowpiercer's analysis of the class system is spotty at best (Marx for kindergartners, maybe?), the allegorical emphasis on obstacles to mobility is worth giving further thought to. Finally, there is an ending worthy of Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is in fact an allegory in the same vein (no, I'm not kidding!). So, should you see it? Well, if it sounds interesting, based on what I just wrote, then yeah, go ahead! It's easily one of the most interesting science fiction ideas out there right now, and it escapes the narrow formulae that ensnare the majority of cinematic efforts at science fiction (film has not done well by science fiction, in balance, in fact, television has done much, much better). Is this one of the best science fiction films of recent years? Absolutely.",Snowpiercer

274,ZuhayrRoha,Sci-fi version of Parasite's Class Division Theme,7,8 August 2020,"I thought the movie was going to be about dystopian world but it focuses more of the Class Division themes. That brought a lot of the ups & downs.Pitfalls being the plot holes. How did they even aboard the train in first? When/How was the track even build? There may be answers(from shows n all) but movie doesn't care to explain. The movie did explain how they lived, food-plants-aquarium & population control.I loved the set pieces, the colour brightness increasing with train's sections was fabulous. Curtis dull getup vs the colourful classroom.Chris Evan gave one of his best performance. That confession scene is one the best only-dialogue scenes I have ever seen, the setup of characters at the start was perfect for this scene to hit the gut punching lines.Tilda Swinton also gave a lasting impression performance, her dressup & hair blended so well. Kang Ho Song was a great side-character who doesn't drop a bit. Kang & Bong's Parasite is the best.Loved some of the twists, saw some coming- like those red letters on protein bars. Gilliam betray felt okay but if he lived his life then it would have been better. Gillaim telling Curtis to cut Wilfard's tongue as he would manipulate him.I am not a huge action fan and this film disappointed me in that area. I did love the wide angle shots and continuous slow-mo shots of Evans fighting but the constant quick cut cut zoom wasn't my cup of tea.The ending of a flawed society being destroyed and life restarting with a girl & a boy was fantastic to end to, left a lose thread for us to fill the rest.",Snowpiercer

276,comicman117,A Bleak Unsettling Great Discovery,9,31 August 2014,"Joon-ho Bong's Snowpiercer is an interesting gem. It is a very bleak, dark, dystopian-styled future film. The film runs over 2 hours long, but goes at a nice pace. As bleak as Snowpiercer was, it was amazingly well done. The direction was fantastic. I loved just about every minute of it and the acting was great. Snowpiercer is set in 2031, when a failed climate-change experiment kills just about everybody on the planet except for those who have been fortunate enough to board The Snowpiercer, a huge train that travels around the globe with a class system. Eventually the lower, literally dirty class led by Curtis (Chris Evans), tries to revolt in an attempt to get the conductors room and find out what's really going on. Snowpiercer is a very dark looking movie. The lead characters look incredibly dirty. This is no doubt from the fact that they've been living in a very muddy part of the train and haven't had any water in years. The tone is consistent throughout the film as the story progresses, characters are brutally killed and bodies pile up. This type of tone may be not pleasing for the general audience, but as a longtime movie buff, I loved how the director approached this, and appreciated it as well. The acting is Snowpiercer is fantastic. The film features a fantastic cast, and none of them feel wasted. You have Chris Evans as the protagonist who is somewhat strikingly unrecognizable with his dirty face. Although Evans does seem to mumble at the beginning of the film, his performance does gradually get better, and by the end, when his character has a breakdown, his emotions and acting are terrifically well done. The rest of the cast includes: John Hurt, playing his usual elderly nice guy character (only this time with a secret); Kang-ho Song as Namgoong Minsoo, a higher-up who can open and close doors on the train who joins Curtis and his rebellion; Octavia Spencer, as a grieving mother whose son is kidnapped; Jamie Bell as Edgar, a sort of wannabe tough guy; Tilda Swinton as Mason, one of the film's main antagonist, as a superior officer type; and Ed Harris, as the train conductor. The performances are all well-acted in the film, and each character serves the story well. One of the things I especially liked about Snowpiercer was how the characters weren't just evil or good. In many ways, the majority of the characters in Snowpiercer are quite unlikeable. It's not just brown and grey, like it can be in so many films. The so-called villains of the story, led by Mason (Tilda Swinton), are portrayed as being higher-ups who don't seem to have any bit of redeeming qualities about them and are heartless, but surprisingly seem to have good points and intentions. On the other side, we have our heroes, led by Curtis, who aren't real heroes when you think about. They attack, they kill, and they are treated more like noble savages than anything. This is consistent with the film's excellent message about the human condition: how a society can go from being considered an elite to completely destroying themselves.The direction by South Korean filmmaker, Joon-ho Bong, doing his first English language film, is excellent. The film definitely fits his trademark style of multiple events occurring in long takes. Scenes, like when the members of the train are revolting, or where the train goes over the bridge, show a lot of things going on all at once and being captured simultaneously in a dark green lighted screen. Snowpiercer does, however, suffer from some of its action scenes, which, while exhilarating to watch, had at times shaky cam overload. Snowpiercer doesn't feel like your usual average blockbuster, despite the fact that it could easily have fallen into that very category. This film was clearly made with an intent. Sure, there are some plot holes in the film, especially regarding the use of the train, but thanks to great direction, great directing, and a great ""muddy, dark"" look, Snowpiercer is among the best of 2014.",Snowpiercer

As far as food, they have oranges, and a few aquarium fish that seem to be impossible to take care of. Where's Wilford getting steaks from?

The carriages are a metaphorical representation of our society and a compilation of interesting characters make this journey-within- a- journey a memorable viewing experience.Joon-ho Bong's solid direction and a fine assembly of actors is the clear strength of the film. Some oddly-placed tonal shifts and choppy CGI due to its limited budget inflict a few dents, but this is a largely enjoyable grim-faced adventure. Chris Evans may have found his best role and delivered his best performance under the wings of the tightly-knit production.The environment created within this always-in-motion world is cryptic and multifaceted. Rather than trying to ramp up everything, the film takes its time to breathe life into the characters & adds drama to its narrative construct. The result is a striking collection of imagery & stimulating sequences that many action-movies seem to pass-up. It's hard not to feel invested in the fate of the train & its less-fortunate passengers while the story gloriously marches towards an exhilarating climax. This is a film that speaks to society and is neatly packaged for the large part; it deserves some reverence and I hope it finds success in its upcoming limited release.Overall, as far as a mix of action and thought-provoking story goes, you'll be challenged to find a better-constructed movie than Snowpiercer in recent times.",Snowpiercer

Tilda Swinton, in one of the greatest performances of 2014, plays Minister Mason, the train's second in command -- and looks and plays her part as if she popped right out of some crazed and drug-induced hyper-Oz. In the actress's own words, ""(my character is) a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns,"" and adds she designed her character as a mixture of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Silvio Berlusconi and Adolf Hitler. In a famous scene, her character holds up a dilapidated shoe and she says, ""Now, as in the beginning, I belong to the front. You below to the tail. When the foot seeks the place of the head, the sacred line is crossed. Know your place. BE A SHOE.""

283,haosstoposto,"Suspenseful, brutal and illogical movie",4,29 April 2014,"It's an allegory, of course. The movie, I mean. It was meant to be an example of how the mankind behaves, and truth be told, I think the movie-makers did get some things right, all the plot-holes aside. It is in human nature to make an unjust society which recklessly ignores the biotope in which it lives. The history is full of such examples, whether we see the situation among the people in prison or among the people in most technologically advanced society in the world. The principle is always the same, those who have the power, tend to keep it in their hands, and those without it tend to rebel against such a society, and more often such rebellions fail. Those which succeed, turn into the same thing people rebelled against. The poor are being exploited and sacrifices so that the rich minority can live in luxury. But now for the movie. Where to begin? It has so many plot-holes and many of those have been in detail analyzed by other reviewers. I will only try to point out some bigger problems. First of all, why train? They could have make the entire thing happen in some underground bunker and everything would be much more logical. This train is perpetually running through the frozen rail tracks, to what end? Nobody repairs those tracks, the train is an isolated ecosystem, or so we are told so there is no need to be on the move. The could just stop and nothing would change. Next thing is a question, why the need the people from the last carriage? They don't contribute with anything accept they eat cockroach-energy-bars. Of course, their children are being taken away but all the same, the people in the last carriage are not necessary. Then we have those cockroach-bars, but where in the world have they found all those roaches? They need probably thousands each day. Then we have that garden with couple of trees but it is not enough to sustain the entire drugged, partying population of the rich. The same goes for the aquarium. And the ending! The ending. The train is destroyed and only a teenage girl and a little boy survive the crash, and go outside to face uncertain future. Or, better said, certain death. They have nowhere to go, nothing to eat. They even see a polar bear, who will probably attack and eat them. They are the last two surviving human beings in the world, as far as the viewer knows from the movie. Even if they could procreate (they can't, because the generation gap is too big) it is a too small a number to restart the humanity. So. After decades of train ride, the humanity finally goes bye-bye.P.S.I gave it four stars, because the movie itself was not boring which is something I can't say for a majority of the movies today.",Snowpiercer

285,dipesh-parmar,Some surprises appear in this riveting film which locks you in till the ambiguous end,8,9 March 2015,"Based on the French graphic novel ""La Transperceneige"", Korean director Bong Joon- ho's 'Snowpiercer' is set in the near future where mankind loses its battle against global warming and enters a new ice age.Prior to the worlds demise, wealthy industrialist Wilford (Ed Harris), constructs a high- speed luxury train that can circle the globe continuously without suffering the effects of the extreme weather outside. Humanity's last remaining survivors reside on the train, but all is not equal. The rich live in comfort at the front of the train, their security buffers them from the end of the train where the poor are forced to live in cramped quarters, be experimented on and eat protein jelly bars.Seventeen years of inhumane conditions have elapsed, after many failed attempts these back-of-the-train revolutionaries are ready to seize their chance for some justice. Old- timer Gilliam (John Hurt) has the ideas, the reluctant leader Curtis (Chris Evans) forms a core team including Edgar (Jamie Bell), Tanya (Octavia Spencer) and Namgoong (Kang- ho Song) and his daughter Yona (An-sung Ko). Besides the guards, they have to contend with the absurdly realised Mason (Tilda Swinton), an English woman handpicked from the 1970′s with a headmistresses tyrannical lack of appreciation of peoples place in society, imagine Margaret Thatcher with big glasses and even bigger teeth.The internal spacial limitations of the train doesn't hinder 'Snowpiercer'. Whether its the carefully staged action sequences to the surreal rooms in various carriages, Joon-ho keeps the suspense flowing effortlessly, with a dash of grotesque humour thrown in. The revolutionaries face carriage after carriage of different battles, representing various philosophical challenges to overcome. And this is the heart of the film, we question why such a system even exists when humanity is so close to extinction. The inevitable meeting between Curtis and Wilfred defines the purpose of everyones existence, and its a dangerous game that both play.The world is full of people in power who make the lazy choices, ie ones which enhance their own power but do little to enable everyone else to a better life. History has shown that you cannot harness a system, resisting the temptation to think you cannot live without it, and that the only humane choice is to destroy the system and start again. Political upheaval is everywhere, just in the recent past we've had the Arab spring and currently with the tensions in Hong Kong. 'Snowpiercer' mirrors the overpowering inequalities which exist in our world already, but some surprises appear in this riveting film which locks you in till the ambiguous end, which could be seen as either a new start or the final curtain for humanity. Its a powerful and thought-provoking reminder that the world is everyones to shape, not the 1% who control the capitalist system we inhabit.",Snowpiercer

289,cguldal,Could be better,7,29 June 2014,"The main problem with the plot of Snowpiercer is what some people have pointed out already: if this train is to be the only place where the last humans survive, why keep the caste/class system? At times, I thought the narrative tried to explain this (rather, explain this away), which was not adequate. Plus, it irritates me when half-baked explanations are based on ""scientific"" stuff, which just makes science sound wrong (I'm a scientist!) So the whole ""this is a closed ecosystem, and we have to be careful how the balance is kept, and everyone has their place"" kind of explanation makes no sense. It does not explain why there are the oppressed people at the back of the train. At some point, I thought Tilda Swinton's character eludes to them being freeloaders, so I thought that some people paid to be on the train, so they get first class, and some had no money, so they go at the back... OK, but why? If you pay to be on the train, why do you want the people in the back? What are they there for? There does not seem to be a need for labor. They don't eat their babies, or fondle the children from the poor parts. There are a few examples of people form the back being used for things in the front, but not in a way that makes you conclude ""ah, so there is demand for these poor idiots in the back, which is why they have them on the train to begin with"" So then the big revelation is supposed to be that they have the oppressed masses in the back so they can revolt now and then to keep the population down? Makes no sense, as it would be just much more effective to kill a certain portion of the population. You could even randomize it, why not? So, why are the poor people on the train again?The second most irritation point about the plot was that there is only ONE person, repeat ONE person, who has noticed that it is getting warmer outside... You would think, if you are stuck in a train in a frozen world, you would have a whole branch dedicated just to monitoring the climate and see if things are getting better to be able to go back outside. But no, they are all a bit crazy, I suppose, and don't care about going back outside. Ever.In the end, one needs suspension of disbelief, but perhaps what the film demanded was a bit too much of it. At times I felt that there must a book somewhere, and the book must have explained these things better than the film. It is an exciting, noisy adventure with lots of bloodshed, most of which was delivered with good flair and big chunks of dark humor. Tilda Swinton really stole the show with her character. The lead was weak (I wondered if this is to be the next Nicholas Cage, with one expression for all emotions), but the Korean actors and the supporting actors shone in all scenes. Overall, a 6.5/10, mostly thanks to good acting by Swinton and the other supporting cast, and great special effects.",Snowpiercer
290,jpc-19,Just a reflection of current society,8,8 May 2021,"Reviews questioned why is there a class system, basically because our society has a vary wide ranging class system. It might seem like a future train, but its more a metaphor how we currently live. We pass time (circling the tracks of the world) doing what needs to be done and sometimes people who are power hungry do things to make other peoples lives more difficult and to stay in power. The children not being shown to be free thinkers but conformists - the education system of every country. Teach them to be loyal to the country while all other lifestyles are wrong and the version of history to make the founders and leaders to be angelic - sounds like grammar school about George Washington and all the of the founders are angelic without question and the queen of england is just a figurehead.

291,swellframe17,Stylized Class Warfare on a Train,7,6 July 2014,"2 1/2 out of 4 stars.Joon-ho Bong's ""Snowpiercer"" is a cold film. It's a sci-fi film that takes place in a post- apocalyptic Earth where the world has been frozen over after an attempt to combat global warming. The only survivors are on a train traveling around the world. The people have been broken up into the thriving first class and the dirty bottom class. Curtis (played by a dark Chris Evans) is part of the bottom half and decides to lead a revolt.The story is brutal and only gets darker as the film progresses. It's nice to see something that is not afraid of being cynical compared to some of the other blockbusters this summer. This is a film that believes in the darkness of humanity, where everyone can and will be cruel if forced. Bong has a distinct style and makes the action intense and brutal. Kyung-pyo Hong's cinematography is just as cold as the frozen tundra that surrounds the train. However, this is a story with so many obvious plot holes. Maybe if I liked it more I would have been more lenient on some of these plot holes. I didn't though. The characters are one-dimensional stock characters. The only one that gets any real depth is Curtis, but it takes us the whole film to finally learn something about him except that he's the reluctant leader. Chris Evans is effective, though, and makes us feel something more. Tilda Swinton has great fun as the villainous Mason and Ed Harris gives a solid performance once he turns up too. Other than those three, there's not much to the characters. Some of them survive things they shouldn't or are given powers that are pointless. The characters and story are forced at times. If it was more of a subjective narrative where one of the characters may be dreaming all this up, maybe I could buy into these forced story lines. I didn't on this first time seeing it though.There are themes of class warfare and Christianity (think of the train as Noah's arc and notice how they talk about the creator of the train). Personally, I don't think they took the themes to anywhere they haven't been before. Bong just looked at them in a darker and more cynical light.""Snowpiercer"" is a solid action film with twists and turns, but once you start to think about it, the film doesn't hold up. I admire the film's style and how cold it can feel, but it's a forced story that doesn't bring much hope.",Snowpiercer

293,DasBobsWorld,Frozen Dystopian Fun!,9,16 January 2019,"A movie that I have seen well more than once, sporting a great cast, and solid action and philosophy packed story. Snowpiercer is a really good Dystopian future movie for the post-2010's. It is still a really good film even after a few viewings.Set in the somewhat near future of 2031, the world has been frozen over after an attempt to stop global warming. The only surviving humans live on a train that makes a year-long journey around the world. This train is not so subtly divided by class structure and the movie uses this to great effect. Although, it is really heavy handed with its philosophies, so if that is not your thing, you might not enjoy Snowpiercer as much. The basic premise of the movie sees Chris Evans character Curtis start an uprising that brings the dregs of society that live in the tail of the train upwards to the front where the people live in a decadent ignorant society. As I said it does so in the least subtle manner. Yet, I find myself not minding the sledgehammer of philosophy in this, as the setting and train itself are so engaging. In any form of movie the train setting makes for such a great closed space, which works perfectly into this films look in a human class structure.The way the movie is shot and looks helps as well, as director Bong Joon-ho does a fantastic job. Although the story gets a bit wonky as it goes along it still never had me doing anything more than nitpick. While strange and weird, there is a world that seems to be layered so deep that in the seventeen years on the train, this future society has stories and myths that can rival some of our own. All of this combined makes for an attention catching and interesting watch.Snowpiercer has a place on my shelf for a lot of reasons, and I really think this is worth the time if you haven't seen it yet. I guess everything has its place after all.",Snowpiercer

After all it's a fantasy-sci-fi metaphor about society, I never felt like I needed actual science consistency here. The acting was on spot, special mention for Tilda Swinton, absolutely great.What I cannot absolve is the fascinating and involving Orwellian story of a revolution turned into a silly horror B movie in the second half.Was there a real need for another immortal baddie, a stabbed hand and a limb being sacrificed?No.Why spoiling such a simple and yet effective story-line on the altar of crap movies?Why giving so much in exchange for so little?I don't get it, without the silly horror elements this Orwellian story would probably be worth an 8 or a 9. Unluckily it really gets annoyingly stupid in those parts that were probably punched in with the illusion of winking at the younger audience. Folks, kids are bombarded with horror flicks, zombies, MTV and dough of any kind, not to mention Youtube. They have seen it all, you don't need 2nd hand sterile horror elements to impress them, you need good ideas.An elderly, ironclad, immortal fatso going around killing everybody including his own minions really is something they should have evicted from the script. Not new, not impressive on any level.

Surely there is enough to be worth addressing (but I won't do that here).The particular lack of realism here is 1) if the outside world isn't survivable, then there would be no reason for the train to travel so much of it - easier to maintain a small circular track.2) And of course, there is nothing to sustain the people who would have to maintain the track. So when the train finally crashes as it does, the remainder of the population will die unnecessarily.3) There is no source of food to sustain the remaining population.There is a Michael Moorcock novel which, although fantasy, manages at least to be just about feasible, in which a moving village is powered by human power.

In terms of the very limited world it has created there were no plot holes: The plot was to go from the back of the doomed train to the front of the doomed train.The problem I had with it is it's a bit too on the nose with its commentary on life, is sorely missing a necessary heavy dose of subtlety, is too poorly characterized, and too cartoonishly acted to be a great movie.It's not that I don't understand what this movie was going for: Human beings on a train together to nowhere, all destined to die, brutally fighting each other over their conceptions of fairness and equal treatment despite the fact they are all doomed and headed to the same end. Yeah, that is pretty true to life.
Maybe the cartoonish elements of the film are meant to highlight the cosmic farce of it all.....But even if that is the case, they just aren't delivered in a coherent and consistent way.It paints a bleak portrait of humanity, with no real redeeming characterizations or hope.

I will tell you the second half of the movie redeems itself as the plot unfolds, the action intensifies, tension picks up, and as the pieces fall into place.

307,akkoziol,"Suspend you disbelief please, it's based on a comic book...but I loved it!",9,31 March 2014,"OK, I have to get this off my chest right away. Like the *original* Oldboy, Snowpiercer is based on a comic book (Manga) so it has elements of ""WTF"" and ""What?"" and other portions of unbelievable scenes and elements. Suspend your disbelief guys, it's supposed to be embellished and laced with some scenes that just seem implausible if not impossible. If you over-analyze this movie you may hate it for the simple fact you won't be able to wrap your mind around how some of the things are even possible on the train (fish tank, atrium, etc.). If you can't get past the fact that it's based on a comic book whose rules bend or defy reality and that, sometimes, you just have to go along with the story, not reality, even if somehow it's not scientifically possible to do the thing you're watching, you'll miss some interesting storytelling. Though it won't be the author's fault, it will be yours.That being said, I really enjoyed Snowpiercer. At times it felt a bit as if it were trying to be too true to the comic book and comes off stiff in parts but compared to a comic-to-movie film like Sin City, which I hated, it has more flow and less stylized ""paneled"" feel like other comic-to-movie adaptations. The best scene in the whole movie, for me, begins with the simple line ""Don't open that door!"" What happens shortly after that---and the night vision---is insane. Great storytelling right there.There is enough movement of the story line to keep the plot going and it felt like a descent into many levels of hell for the passengers of the train as they progress forward to the front of the train. The story feeds you bits and pieces without the need for flashbacks or other usual storytelling mechanisms. It unfolds as you watch. You certainly aren't given much info on the mysterious Wilford but later on you realize the purpose of the train, the circuitous nature of it's journey, and so on. After all, after CW7 was released, the Earth didn't just gradually cool, it froze almost instantly. There was no preparation or time for people ""get out"" or go underground. Another reviewer mentions this but perhaps did not realize it was all instantaneous.I guess it is a bit silly to have events happen on a train but I cannot tell you how many times I sang ""Going off the rails on the Crazy Train"" during the movie. Perhaps it is the intent of the author of the story to liken (and use) the train to the passage of life/time and it's engine as the heart or something. As in, you're at the mercy of the conductor and you can't get off when you want. I don't know, I was not looking too deeply for metaphors or symbolism but I think they're there if you choose to see them.Tilda Swinton and Chris Evan's characters were great and being that the movie is replete with no-name actors (save for Ed Harris) and is for all intents and purposes a *wholly* Korean movie, it still felt enjoyable, foreign, and not the usual Hollywood garbage. And speaking on that point, I cannot think of any movie made in Korea---or elsewhere---that was 99% in English and had nearly all Western actors. Bonus points for that. This is indicative of a trend for what's being done in Korea.So to recap, Snowpiercer is a unique movie with a unique story. I think it would do well if it came to the US. Suspend your disbelief, realize it's based on a comic book and you'll do OK. I didn't particularly like the last 5 minutes of the movie or the ending otherwise I would have given it a 10. Maybe it's indicative of a sequel? Or not? YMMV.",Snowpiercer

Seriously? The world ends and this is the best solution they could come up with to keep humanity going?? A train?? Really??I couldn't get past how catastrophically ridiculous and utterly unbelievable this idea is. Not an underground city or even a large bomb shelter? Nope. A moving train. Wow, brilliant. No spaceships or aliens? /sarcasm Just the logistics of the idea make it impossible to take this movie seriously.Forget about what it takes to keep a human alive... keeping a train running for years on end? What??? Fuel, parts, maintenance. No stops. You're supposed to refuel, perform repairs, and so on, without stopping? Right. What about the tracks? There's no debris or malfunctions with ANY of the tracks?My first thought was, what powers the train? Since I couldn't get past that, it wasn't even worth thinking about how they would keep the passengers alive, who got to be on the train and why, who's running things, etc. Does the train just go in a huge circle? Why even be on a train if you aren't going somewhere?Forgetting all of the above, the terrible and over-the-top performances from some of the actors was unbearable to watch. The characters go from totally believable to completely unbelievable. There's nothing in between. I was thinking that the directors must have known that this movie was not meant to be taken seriously. It has to be tongue-in-cheek. Right?

It was too stupid to watch.Well, watch it and you'll know what I mean. Or don't and find a freshly painted wall to sit around and watch dry. That will be a much more pleasurable experience.Anyway, there is no way this movie has an accurate rating. It's not possible.

317,sonicheze8,A thoughtful movie that presents a multitude of ideas and allegories,8,20 October 2018,"Snowpiecer is an idealogical sci-fi, not the sci-fi which movies put as a tag and plaster in cool effects and be done with it.
Sci-fi is a genre that allows the exploration of ideas that sometimes are not entertaining enough to be presented in real-life. To begin, I believe that the movie itself is worth a viewing, it's an excellent long thought experiment with some stellar moments yet unperfected in certain scenes probably due to this being the first English movie directed by Bong. Snowpiercer is also quite quirky, which I believe is due to it being an English-language South Korean-Czech science fiction action film based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige. Thus, the multiple styles and translation and the mix of cultures make this quite an intriguing experience.Well, I think the first thing that makes itself apparent is the class system, how classes are divided in the train. Yet personally I didn't think this was a great argument on class and social hierarchy. Yes, its very clear that it was present in the movie, and it was a central theme and conflict in the narrative, but my take on this film is something entirely different. I believe this film portrayed ideas of humanity's prowess in adaptation. To them, the train is their world, and they believe in obtaining control over the engine is control over their world. This idea appeals to me as if to us it seems that it doesn't make much sense that the world could be a train, but the fact is that it could apply to our world. Perhaps our lives are small as well, we will meet a minuscule amount of people, see a small part of the world in our lifetime, what's the difference between ours and theirs in a train. This idea is just one of the ones that I picked up while watching this film.Thus, I think this movie is at its best an entertaining and thrilling thought experiment. Although it might seem quirky and contain some oddly paced scenes, it's still a good movie that will make you think and that's what I like my movies to be.",Snowpiercer

I was appalled at how poorly the characters in this movie were introduced. The acting was barely passable in way too many scenes.Snowpiercer came off as pretentious and was an abomination of a film. What a waste of time... what a stupid ending. This is already too many words to describe this film.It's bad, don't watch it. Don't make my mistake.",Snowpiercer

This is someone trying to mix Japanese cinematic action culture with Hollywood action and it just doesn't work. Odd cuts like it was time for a commercial breaks all the time. Speaking of commercials, they plug tobacco brands, distasteful. Even coming from me, a smoker.The cgi is from 1999, the acting is so bad it becomes a turkey movie.The story gets side swiped by all kinds of unrelated adventures so if you like National Treasure you'll probably love this movie.No no no.

Sadly its a 'Hollywood ending' intended for the movie to end on an up beat.If you are in the 1% you should see this as what inevitably happens when the elite allow the peasant class to suffer beyond reason.

Yes, it does have some minor technical flaws, but overall it is such a beautiful movie that any such flaws are forgiven. The only complaint I have (and I don't say this often) is that it is a bit too short. The protagonists stay a long time in the back of the train, while their journey through the train is a bit too fast. I wanted to see more of this dystopian society crammed into one train. Maybe the upcoming television series will improve that.",Snowpiercer

326,Matt-144-792009,A Dark Futuristic Sci Fi Experience with Cult Movie Appeal,7,2 January 2015,"In the not too distant future a global climate changing experiment goes horribly wrong causing the entire planet to become a frozen tundra wasteland. The only few remaining inhabitants are on a train that circumnavigates the globe in a moving self-sustaining eco stem. Each part of the train is segregated into different classes, the front being the elite aristocrats who eat well and live lavishly. The back is made up of the poor, the tired, the weak and the downtrodden. After witnessing the torture and slave like treatment of the back passengers, Curtis (Chris Evans) leads a Spartacus like revolution to charge to the front of the train. Snowpiercer, directed by South Korean director Joon-ho Bong has a very unique look and intelligent design in comparison to other Sci-fi movies of its kind. This is a very dark, gritty Orwellian version of the future. I could not help be reminded of Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys (1995) and Brazil (1985), or David Fincher's Alien 3 (1992). I think the late great Stanley Kubrick would have been a fan of this film. There is a scene where the song Midnight, the Stars and You plays quietly in the background. A haunting piece of music used in The Shinning (1980) that I cannot help but take as a tip of the hat to Kubrick. The cast is also above and beyond what you would expect to see in a film like this. Chris Evans performance is nothing special, but it shows some promise in his ability to take on projects with some depth. Tilda Swinton is almost unrecognizable in her role as Mason, a woman from the front of the train who is sent to the back to maintain order and MC torture and punishment. John Hurt plays Gilliam (possibly an homage to Terry) a wise elder of the back car class. Having John Hurt in a Sci-Fi movie given his role in the classic Alien (1979) is a very nice touch. He just feels like sci-fi horror to me. Ed Harris plays Wilford the designer and conductor of the train. He has always looked a lot like Kier Dullea from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to me and in this film more than ever. The message of this film above all the best part. We as a society are all headed in the same direction, much like the passengers of the train. Bound together by the inability to change the damaged environment that has ultimate say on all of our survival. We can try to press forward with our flawed societal system, but ultimately there is nothing we can do to prevent our inevitable demise. Dark yes, but no less valid. As a Science Fiction fan I enjoyed this movie. I was able to suppress a lot of my issues with the hows and whys of the futuristic environment of a perpetually moving train that supports life for years on end, and just take in the visual thrill ride. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of older and more obscure sci-fi flicks. This is by far one of the best movies of that genre available new on Netflix today if you are looking for a good one.If you enjoyed this review please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",Snowpiercer

I love that every actor has given an amazing performance. I like the visuals in the film, the slow-mo scenes and also the presence of mind tactics used.The Bad - Plotholes. Don't get me wrong but you would realize in the end how the entire movie is not to be seen logically. I wouldn't go in the logical part stressing on ""How"" because it's a Science *Fiction* movie. It's not a Nolan movie where you would be in an existential crisis or be left wondering stuff, it's straightforward whether you like it or not.If you are into the Sci-Fi genre, go ahead and give this movie a try.

The cinematography and visionary style of the movie is excellent.There were some great moments in this movie and the action sequences are very well choreographed.

331,matic-boh1,A poorly executed sci-fi thriller that fails to convey its provoking message,5,25 July 2014,"By focusing on a futuristic apocalyptic world, where the remaining population lives together on one colossal train and a class system begins to emerge, Snowpiercer attempts to blend ferocious action of Asian cinema with engrossing drama, but instead produces a rather ridiculous film that does not fit the scope of either genre, as neither the action nor the dramatic features are executed thoroughly. Although the initial and the concluding phase of the film prove satisfying, the vast majority of the running time is dominated by an audacious storyline that loses itself in its own ambitious goals, which ultimately defines the film. Overall, the audience is exposed to a distasteful amount of exaggerated violence and the film often appears bizarre without any particular reason, which takes away from the original premise, one that carries a strong metaphorical message. Snowpiercer aims to serve as a profound social critique, but due to its unconvincing execution the deep themes and concepts it tries to tackle are merely touched upon and remain largely unexplored.",Snowpiercer

It's a mixture of Korean-America production which features a thrilling social class issue more details in an extreme and sentimental way. The special way of presenting, good effects as well as editing ensures a balanced horror and action sequences throughout this futuristic story, which is eventually, able to retain audience's patience and to test their intelligence at all times.

There seem to be an awful lot of people who there who put a movie into the ""Classic Arty"" box if it has a couple of surreal scenes in it, and then proceed to forgive the rest for being mindless.Personally, I think that three directors were making completely different movies and some producer found some of their clips, bundled them together and said - hey we've got a movie here.A few of the scenes remind me of Terry Gillian - these make the film into a 5 rating rather than a 3. Then you have those that I think they got Steven Seagal in for. The rest reminded me of 2012 - or maybe Earth 2 - an endless drivel of unbelievable nonsense - both scientifically unsound, and unbelievable character behaviour.The ""twists"" are where characters suddenly do things that they simply wouldn't do - unless bereft of sanity. I won't list all the fallacies - believe me it would take me longer than it took to watch the movie to put them all down and other reviewers have done a decent job.

334,mmendez-22089,Not bad! - I was a little hesitant at first to watch this film,8,5 September 2015,"I actually read a review from one a friends diary on here and decided that maybe I should touch it. I am familiar with the work of Joon-Ho Bong, such as The Host and Mother (which I have been dying to see; own the film but just haven't gotten around to it).First off, let us start out with the cast/players of the film. Chris Evans, our own Captain America, does a A-okay performance in this one. Nothing too noticeable though other than how he can play a decent bad-ass. The work done by Tilda Swinton, Ed Harris, Jamie Bell, and John Hurt were all beautiful. I do not think any one of those motherfunkers can ever let me down in a film. I also enjoyed how Bong brought in his South-Korean talents Kang-Ho Song and Ah-Sung Ko from his previous film, The Host, which I definitely recommend, especially after watching this project***I thought this was going to be another action flick with a dimwitted story premise and weak character-connections, but there was none of this, in my opinion. Everything for me fell right into place and made up for a better ending; the best they can get, honestly.**Basically, this a the near future in 2031, when the world is apocolyptized and facing yet another ice-age; ""failed global-warning experiment"". The only survivors left in the world are the ones who have boarded the Snowpiercer train that travels around the entire world. - On a side note, I think they could have done better with the TITLE of the film. Just saying. - Our story begins in furthest point; back of the train, where our lower-class passengers suffer from starvation and consistently eating the same blocks of gooey (protein) food for years. 18 to be exact. // Curtis is who we follow from his lousy LIFE IN the back-of-the-train to the furthest he can reach. In a way this film is a stand-up-to-the-man kind of film. As far as we know, this is their whole world. A Train. And the facts of life are different on this chair of conflicts.I consider this film a mind-bender in its own non-unique way. Well, I can't say that. I mean, what other movie is based all on-board of a train? Darjeeling Limited? Well they stepped out a few times here and there, but that is not the film we are talking about.Snowpiercer, in many words, will surprise a lot of you, I think. Judging from how I just heard about it this year (2015), I think people are now starting to recognize its potential and witty dialogue, especially from Tilda Swinton's characters //FUN FACT: the role of Mason (Tilda Swinton) was written for John C. Riley in mind. ""And that, my dear children, you can take to the BANK."" ~ WWI RATE this movie a whopping 3.5 out of 5 stars. I very much enjoyed it, although it is NOT my cup of tea, even in psycho-thrillers, I still have to give it a sexy orange heart for trying.

Unfortunately it's full of a few silly bits and bobs that left be frustrated and grabbing for the nearest bottle. The Protagonist is your typical run of the mill, dark and mysterious tortured soul who inevitably loses his best mate.Their are two Korean characters in it who feature heavily, that are extremely annoying for the most part - mainly because you can't understand what they are saying for the most of it (some scenes have no subtitles) and the women is just pure stupid. There is a voice translator at the end in the film- why don't they just use it so we can actually understand what the Korean guy is saying? They sit their in dialogue without it and it just annoyed me after a while. Mainly because I WANTED to like this film. I know it's easy to pick a film apart, but this film gave me plenty of ammo to do so - the scene of them shooting guns out of the train window is ridiculous. The end is unsatisfying and delivery of that bit was a bit poor. It very predictable too. I like films that make me think and leave me asking questions, but useful questions that matter, not questions that I feel need to be answered for this film to make more sense. Beef?

339,ShanTeaTime,Fantastical Claustrophobic Visuals Mixed With The Intensity Of A Train Heist,6,23 January 2020,"""Snowpiercer"" is a science-fiction action film directed by Bong Joon-ho, based on the French graphic novel ""Le Transperceneige"" by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette. The movie takes place aboard the Snowpiercer train, operating on a globe-spanning track, carrying the last remnants of humanity after an attempt at climate engineering in order to stop global warming has unintentionally created a new Snowball Earth.Bong Joon-ho man, he's one d*** good director. He's so innovative in his story-telling and directing. This film's entire premise essentially revolves are class-structure (which he seems to love to commentate on) and environmental struggles. Both blend very well together and the story ebbed and flowed perfectly like the train it's set on. Though the last 15-20 minutes of the film kind of changes tone slightly and those would have to be the weakest points for me personally.Seeing the change between the back ""poorer class"" of the train and the ""higher class"" front portion of the train was fascinating. Visually it was amazing, the back was so claustrophobic! Bong Joon-ho really knows how to visually represent tone within his films, which is probably my favorite thing about him. You feel despair and discomfort at the back, but as we gradually see the front as the viewer this feeling of anger sets in. Because you see how segregated society has become! The well off passengers are so care free, whereas the entirety of our main characters struggled for survival. Speaking of characters, the ones we have here and pretty great! Chris Evans is the best I've seen him and Song Kang-ho really knows how to command presence in any role. Tilda Swinton is playing a very strange character, which isn't strange for her and she's one of my favorite actors so I wish I could've seen even more from her in this. I also miss John Hurt so I was thrilled that he was in this.The visuals and action sequences of this film make me want to revisit it again in the future. Though the ending could've used work, it's definitely still clear that the closing message of the film is around hope and life's way of finding a way to survive. Definitely watch this film, especially if you're wary of diving into Bong Joon-ho's film catalog. The film is about 80% in English so his versatility is to be admired, he never loses his filmmaking flair.",Snowpiercer

341,treborbasset,Just absurdly bad,3,11 December 2020,"I wonder if all the good reviews were watching something else. This movie made no sense. The entire premise of it was stupid, the story was bad and full of plot holes, the dialogue was boring and jilted, the characters had no personality and their actions were seemingly random throughout the entire film. At no point did I care what happened to anyone, or have any desire to know what would happen next. It just felt like a series of bad disconnected scenes.I have no idea what Tilda Swinton was doing in this movie. Did she think she was in a comedy? And why did characters get stabbed and die and then recover? Who even were some of these people? They had no introduction and seemingly just existed as occasional nonsensical plot points.Why was there a train car full of people wearing masks over their eyes and brandishing axes, who then suddenly all have night vision goggles? And what was the point of the guy running through half the train with a torch as if he'd been preparing for this moment his entire life?I get the feeling that maybe the director was trying to pay homage to a comic with some of these ridiculous scenes, but it was just baffling.

343,bakchu,"Original, flawed, entertaining",7,4 May 2014,"Major spoilers ahead, you've been warned. - Yes, this movie has some glaring flaws in its logic, and some things remain unexplained. Indeed: The train's track would need maintenance - if the passengers are all what is left of humanity and the train never stops for maintenance work, sections of the track should have quickly become impassable. The engine remains a mystery. The whole biological cycle / ecosystem of the train is implausible: As others have noted, where does the massive amount of cockroaches used for producing the protein bars come from? Well, there might be a car with a big cockroach breeding facility in the train, but then, these would also need nutrition, and where does *that* come from? As well as nutrition for all the fish, chicken etc. we see in the first class cars... the allegedly self-sufficient system of the train doesn't seem really viable.Other often criticized things I see as less of a problem: Yes, it doesn't seem logical to create Wilford's ""Ark"" in the form of a train instead of something stationary (would also be more energy-efficient), but it doesn't *need* to be logical: After all, Wilford is depicted as some rather nutty zillionaire who just happens to like trains very much, so it's thinkable that he simply *wanted* to use this train, despite more sensible possibilities. There's nothing particularly implausible with the ending. It is puzzling and one might wonder what the director is trying to say, but we can simply accept it as it is: The train wrecked, the girl and the boy alive, and the last thing they see is a polar bear. So, maybe they get eaten by the bear soon. Or there are more survivors in the train (quite possible) and the next thing that happens is that one of them shoots the bear, and a group of survivors manages to create the start of a new society by building igloos etc. in a thawing world - after all, that's something also explicitly stated in the movie: the snow is gradually melting, the world already becoming warmer again. It's a very open end that could even leave room for a sequel. But maybe it's really just meant as an ending of dark irony, along the lines of ""that's the end of humanity, and the temporary survival of these two means nothing, see the polar bear?"" We don't know, and that's fine for me.Also, despite all its flaws, this is at least an original and entertaining movie with interesting visuals that never gets boring (well, almost never - it's a bit slow in the beginning). It's a different setting, and the actors are doing a decent job. There's also some odd, dry and dark humor in it, which I appreciate.Some people have compared ""Snowpiercer"" to Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", and maybe that's a surprisingly fitting comparison: Like ""Metropolis"", ""Snowpiercer"" has some really fascinating visuals. Like ""Metropolis"", it tries to transport messages on society in a heavy-handed way. And like ""Metropolis"", it's not very logical and has a rather weak story. But it certainly will not attain the classic status of Lang's film.",Snowpiercer

Let's begin with the idea a train could operate moving thousands of miles at high speed through extremely frigid weather without elaborate and ongoing inspection of the rails and repair/replacement as needed, leading to shutdown of the train on a regular basis. Let's imagine multiple levels of societies could exist within a train of perhaps 50 cars, where babies are born, raised, and become expectant members of a 1984 like layered society of pre-conditioned zombies. Let's imagine a grubby crew of 100 at the back end, outfitted like the boys from Oliver Twist, ramping up a revolution to overthrow their oppressors by noticing their guardians are out of ammunition. There is much more to imagine in Snowpiercer but it all is a phony speculation on what the public is willing to plunk down their 10 bucks for, not toward what might constitute something worth spending time on for entertainment, enlightenment, or admiration.

I believe this was supposed to be analogous to how life works in the real world (?) - The guy who made the train occasionally prompts the poor people he has living at the back of the train start riots so as to allow for the killing of some people... for some reason this 'balances' out the 'Eco-system' on the train - This story is the last time this type of prompt happens because I guess the creator didn't really think it through very well...Others have listed the countless plot-holes that I would agree with. Most of the movie I was saying: ""What?"", ""Why?"", ""How?"" Struggle through the confusion of the 'science' and 'reason' behind what is happening and your left with what seems like a redemption story combined with a story that tries to portray the weird eccentric breaking free from the nature of society to play with a polar bear in the cold.3 stars for interesting set, 2 marks for some bizarre acting, 1 mark for at least keeping my attention while I tried to figure out if I was losing my mind or if the story actually didn't make sense.",Snowpiercer

350,LansTaylor,Very entertaining from start to finish,6,8 May 2020,"This film has been on my list to watch for years now and for some reason it kept getting pushed down further and further for other films. I'm very glad that I finally got to watch it because it was very entertaining from the opening shot to the final shot. I know that this is a film by Bong Joon Ho (Parasite), and you can see a lot of characteristics from him throughout this film.
This film has basically two halves; the first is the back on the train where all the lower class lives and the second, where the lower class attempts to take over the rest of the train. I really enjoyed the first half but the second half felt so rushed and scattered. Like, every time they break into the next train it gets more and more ridiculous (in a bad way). I though bullets were scarce but apparently all the guards are just shooting like they have an unlimited magazine. The most ridiculous part is when the main henchmen is shooting Chris Evans character from across the train through the windows. First off, that's not how bullets work and second, if the air outside is unbearably cold, why is he creating so many unnecessary holes in the train? I'm usually not one to nit pick things and I know that this movie is set in a dystopian future but I can't help but wonder how they are getting all this material and how they can even afford to keep this train moving. Who is maintaining the tracks? If theres huge chunks of ice covering the tracks and the engine collides with it going full speed, something is going to have to give.
The ending was kind of a let down and was the shot of the polar bear an indication that those kids were eaten alive? Polar bears are the top human predators.
Overall, it was a very entertaining movie but I can't help but wonder how the train runs. It's an important detail that is unfortunately left out.",Snowpiercer

Awesome cinematography with some really beautiful and haunting imagery. The score and sound design is also very good.Acting performances are good, but not much more.

352,krational,Human Nature,8,31 May 2020,"The film is not very bloody, but it is built on the background of black suppression, extinction and despair, and the chill comes from the imagination. This is a human parable, about revolution and class, and even made some feelings like Bible apocalypse. The ambition of the film is too great, and the film can't bear it a little bit. It can only end in a hurry, relying on a few monologues to tell the core. The action scenes are great, rhythmic and funny. Fish, kindergarten. Tilda Swinton is very dazzling",Snowpiercer

There is no explanation for the 90% of the events in the film. For example, the arrangement of wagons: elementary school next to the slaughterhouse, people who jumped from the train still standing in the same place and not covered with snow; from where milions of cockroaches come from in train? People are starving and by default are doomed to cannibalism (stupidest thing in the movie, and the story of how they ate babies). The main goal of the story: great plan for population control - create riot and kill people - in train, sacred train, that never stops. The idiocy of idiocy. Indeed with sadness I regret the time I've spent on this garbage movie. My strong recommendation is as soon forget that this movie ever existed.",Snowpiercer
354,toby-brace,Interesting and powerful and very very violent,5,24 August 2014,"This is not science fiction. It's really allegorical fantasy with a strong sci-fi flavor. There's no doubt it is a tour de force and very entertaining. The violence was excessive however. It could have done what it did without so much obscene gore. If you start to pick holes in the logic it quickly unravels, and that is the reason I gave it only 5 stars. Once the premise is accepted then it was bound to be a bit silly since it doesn't withstand close scrutiny. If you are prepared to let it be a rich and powerful fantasy with a well executed allegorical message then you will be carried along by the amazing direction and lavish sets and generally superb level of creativity on display. Tilda Swinton deserves an Oscar for her performance. She almost carries the film single handed and I could watch her horrible, strange and fascinating character till the cows come home.

355,TheMovieVlog,Snowpiercer is an interesting take on dystopian future,6,19 June 2014,"Snowpiercer is an interesting take on dystopian future, set in a train circling around the desolate frozen world. The train has a class system, and the working class revolts, making snowpiercer somewhat of a mix between Children of Men and The Raid. The film is a solid exhibition of a dystopian future on a train, but I'd also like to see a Utopian version since the upper quartile of the train seemed like a great place for a film to be set it.snowpiercer has a really solid cast, and Joon Ho Bong does well in his American film debut, this does the lack the humor his Korean films have though. The film incorporates a lot of Interesting political messages, ranging from nazism (the education), capitalism (class system), communism (""government"" owns everything and workers revolt), fascism (government controls everything), etc. And It does all this without having an agenda or being preachy.The end of the film is fairly poor, but the concepts and setting make up for the films lacking.",Snowpiercer

The only other character that held my interest was Tilda Swinton who was terrific but underused. The movie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be. The action was so unbelievable, at times it tried to be realistic and then tried to be a comic book. Plots holes are so numerous all the way through.

358,isabelle-frater,Perplexing dystopia,5,1 January 2015,"I didn't hear about this movie until it was mentioned in a list of movies never released in the theatres in Hungary that were good. That's where I live, BTW. The concept sounded interesting and unique, so I decided to check it out. I also do have a thing for dystopias.The movie is about a train that goes around the world, carrying the last members of humanity. In an experiment that we managed to mess up, we managed to freeze the whole world. The train was built to be a self- sustaining economy. I did wonder how that would work.The first thing that came into my mind was ""guns?"" That's the first thing you see on the the screen of the train. A man carrying a machine gun. In a way that describes the whole movie. It is very violent. The basic plot is that the people who live in the back, the poor section, try to take over the engine at the front, to control the train, the world, really.The rich people control the food, punish rebellious poor people, and seem to be generally running a religious rhetoric of the ""sacred engine"" and Wilford, the holy creator of the engine. An interesting thing is that none of the poor people seem to be buying the religious rhetoric, only the rich ones. The people in the tail section don't even actually do anything, but seem to just breed and consume resources. However, most of the people in the front, the rich don't seem to be doing anything either.Chris Evans plays Curtis. The leader of the rebellion against the people in the front. The movie is more about his struggle than anything. We often see his face in a close-up.John Hurt plays Gilliam, who guides Curtis in his adventure.Yona, played by Ah-sung Ko is a strange girl, who has an especially good hearing.The characters don't feel close. I couldn't really connect to their struggle, as the emphasis seemed to be more on the violence than anything.What Wilford said at the end felt rational, while cruel. However, in the situation it would have been the only way to go. The real problem that I saw with the whole thing was that the very existence of humanity in this form didn't have a point. You'd think that humans as a whole are really just worth their existence as long as they develop, create, and make strides to better themselves. The humans on the train are just like the train. Going around and around, not reaching anything, not having any goals other than being there.The ending was weird. I guess there was supposed to be hope there, but what would have really been the point?Overall, not an average movie, but I would have liked less fighting, more characterisation. Also, an ending that makes more of a sense. Watchable though, and finding out what the whole train was like kept me going.",Snowpiercer

360,keithsealy,Dumb premise and poor writing,3,3 November 2014,"There are a few moments of greatness in this movie, but the premise and overall story are so dumb that it is hard to watch and not cringe. I watched it because it had a lot of star on Netflicks and here, but don't really recommend it.The premise is that the last 1000 people on earth are on a train that travels around the planet in a continuous loop. There is a class system on the train, and this follows a group from the bottom who a revolting against this class system.Why a train? Why not a cave? A ship? A space station? But a train? Why? There are several times in the movie when they show why a train is such a bad idea (ice on the tracks that almost derails the train, a train has moving parts that don't last, etc). When I first started watching, I wondered if the train was because they had to keep moving for some reason; such as to stay in the daylight. In that case, a train could make sense... but no... it is on a train because the director/writer thought it was cool. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.While I don't disagree that a class system might arise, the depiction here is just too silly, too heavy handed. Many movies has examined this idea, where the rich separate themselves from the poor. But, in this case, the separation is too stylized, too silly, too ridiculous.Where is all of the food made? You see where the food for the poor people is made and a couple of tomato plants in the green house, but to sustain this number of people you would need dozens of cars worth of greenhouses. And, even one cow (we see butchered beef several times) would require significant feed. Likewise, where are the dormitories where all of the people sleep? There are car with spas, hair salons, and hot tubs... but no where where these people sleep.The script telegraphs the final conclusion many times during the movie. It is a premise done much better in other movies, including the Matrix trilogy.I understand that this was meant to be stylized. The theme is meant to overcome our suspension of belief of a 'self sustaining system', but this movie just fails. I gave it 3 stars for a few good scenes.",Snowpiercer

So, if any parts of the plot seem odd it might be a good idea to take a look at the novel first. While this film is an adaptation of the novel and just loosely follows the book's plot, it is executed well and will entertain you thoroughly. The idea of human survivors living on a perpetually moving train seems odd but is so refreshingly original! How about that? A premise for a sci-fi movie that is odd and doesn't make 100% sense. There are people of all shapes, sizes, ages, races, and even handicaps in this film. Part of the film isn't even in English but is subtitled in Korean! Science fiction is my favorite film genre and I haven't felt this happy watching a film since the last ""Hunger Games"" movie and ""District 9"". It's a refreshing 2 hours without Hollywood clichés! Go watch it just to see what a blockbuster film can look like without the cookie cutter tired old tropes running through every movie coming out of Hollywood!Tilda Swinton was also genius as Minister Mason, who is responsible for overseeing the prisoners...er...inhabitants of the tail end of the train.

366,emphedokles,Class warfare on a train. Really?,2,15 April 2014,"This was the most idiotic high budged SciFi movie i have seen in a long time. A train riding around the earth over a frozen planet. The big question is: Why? Why on earth would you taking the risk of traveling at high speed through the snow with a train, when you have an incredible machine that gives you all the energy you need for electricity and heating? The basic story is about some kind of class warfare where people at the end of the train start a revolution to get to the top of the train and then control it. There is not even an explanation why the people in the first place got separated in ""poor"" and ""rich"". They have endless energy, heat and food (which is made out of cockroaches !?.) Why should they put hundreds of people in total pureness into one or two wagons? So the only and very stupid explanation to that is: Rich people are evil. The solution to that in that movie is. The poor just kill all rich people. And after that everybody is free to freeze to death. Except of a Chinese chick and a black boy which gets eaten by an polar bear. Thats maybe because all humans are evil in the mind of the creators of that moist movie dream of all socialists? Well the stupidity of that movie just starts with the really senseless story of ""All humans deserve to die but rich people first"". A SciFi movie do not have to be physically correct at every point. But they have to be logical and have to makes sense. And that movie is illogical from the beginning to the end. After watching it for the first 20 minutes you will be so busy with counting the logical failures which appear every few minutes in that movie, that you are not even able to concentrate on the story any more. SciFi fans, stay away from that trash. Only if you are a communist, a member of peta and also drunk like a skunk, then the movie may be fun for you. Poor kill rich, then the rest of humanity gets killed and the polar bear gets a free meal. Nastrovje!",Snowpiercer
367,RuthlessGoat,Snowpiercer: Bong goes American for a fine film,8,10 July 2014,"I really like Korean Film (Thanks, Steen). When I saw that Joon-Ho Bong was making a movie for us Americans, I was both thrilled and apprehensive, not knowing how badly things would be screwed up. Certainly unknown to most casual moviegoers, Joon-Ho Bong is a Master and is known for movies like ""Barking Dogs Never Bite"" (2000), ""Mother"" (2009) and the blockbuster masterpiece ""Memories of Murder"" (2003). There were demands for changes to shorten the film, do voice over explanations so that idiotic Americans from Tennessee and other great states would be able to follow the film without scratching their heads, crying,or blaming The Kenyan for their own stupidity, but I'm getting off the trail here. A compromise was reached and fortunately the movie was not totally ruined. Snowpiercer was all about the effects of Global Warming and the resultant human attempted intervention that backfired horribly. What we are left with is a Super, perpetual motion engineered train that circumvents a now frozen and snowy planet, in a continuous loop. Yes, I know, there are plot holes galore, and if the viewer lets himself be distracted by them, the movie will not be enjoyable. As in most science fiction movies, much disbelief must be suspended for the viewer to enjoy the movie without poisoning the outlook with details. I don't know how the residents were chosen, where the chickens or bugs came from and I really do not care, as far as I am concerned there is enough back story and unless you have just a rotting sponge masquerading as your brain, you should be able to figure it out enough to enjoy it. If not, go enjoy ""God is Real"" or an Adam Sandler movie. There were some outstanding acting performances in this film. Chris Evans (Captain America) is smashing as Curtis, the reluctant but passionate physical leader of the rebellion. His character is painstakingly developed and he seems somehow inconsolable and as the action dies down and more details of the grisly history of the rolling tenement is revealed, we find out exactly why in a chilling series of revelations. Tilda Swinton was magnificent as Mason. Her character was both deeply chilling and hilarious at the same time as she dominates every single scene she is in. The over-the-top cold-blooded intensity set the tone for the ever rolling Snowpiercer, which was both an engineering marvel and a chamber of horrors. ""Know your place. Accept your place. Be a shoe.""Alison Pill totally killed it as the pregnant and precious teacher in what I thought was the best scene in the movie, the unbelievable and surreal scene in the school room of the train. To write more would spoil things, but it was both shocking and gratifying as the Director cleverly used this bizarre pause in the action to reveal critical information about the Wilford Express. The magnificent Ed Harris was almost unrecognizable as Wilford, but as always (Radio excepted) delivered a stellar performance late in the film. The cinematography, sets and music were high points in this film and we must appreciate what a difficult job it must have been to present a realistic, or as realistic as possible setting. The rear of the train is just grimy and claustrophobic, a picture of sadness and chronic human misery. The contrast of this human wave of despair with the front of the train is almost cartoonish, but Bong balances these interludes of stark differentiation of the classes near perfectly. I considered NOT viewing this film for several reasons, not the least of which is the disdain for this type of movie, but the magical name of Bong gave it instant credibility. The movie is destined for a long life as a cult favorite in my opinion. In the spirit of Metropolis or 1984 the peons realize that the pigs are walking on their hind legs as their fate deteriorates as the metal capsule and trailing carloads of humans makes its never-ending journey to nowhere. The movie is far from perfect and does stumble and drag as The Train is a huge, magnificent organism, supposedly eternal, but all things much eventually succumb to molt, rust, decay and death, and the viewer is given some home for the survival of the microorganism that crawl from the ashes.I must comment about the negative reviews of Snowpiercer, and there are plenty. This entertaining film was universally praised by professional critics, but drew a lot of fire from what is the Comic Book Crowd, I guess. This is not a surprising reaction from those basement dwellers whose number one source of entertainment outside of Loliporn is abusing their parent's vacuum cleaner and whose number two source of entertainment is throwing loaded vacuum cleaner bags off of Interstate overpasses onto passing vehicles. O.K., fine, I get it, Snowpiercer is not a perfect movie and perhaps some of the cuts should have been made, especially at the end, but for the most part this Sci-Fi work of Korean cinema was most watchable and enjoyable. For you detractors, just view the train as a video game cipher, going from level to level, and you should be fine.",Snowpiercer

Overall the characters lack depth and development, they seem at times erratic and not well though through which is shows to different scenes where it seems the director went ""uh, let's make this character do this other thing, people will not see that coming"", well of course no one. Would see that coming because there wasn't any space for people to figure out the character; which than comes over just as a blunt try of creating a ""OMG"" moment.Eventually the movie would have done better either sticking to the action (flat movie) or going after the msg (deeper movie).",Snowpiercer

Or maybe he was a liability.I'll back that up with his famous line (he's sniveling by the way) ""and you know what? Babies taste best....sniffle...sniffle."" I'm a fan of the post apocalyptic stuff and I think it's almost impossible to make a film of this genre less than mediocre.Okay, so this Wilford guy (Ed Harris) invents a perpetual motion engine for a train and wants to ride around the world on it until the end of time because the world is frozen by a geo-engineering disaster.Good for him.He brings a bunch of people with him, from very rich to dirt poor. It's up to him who gets on the train though as it is under his strict control.This is where my issues with the film start. Why have poor people on the train at all? Especially if you're going to steal all of their possessions and make them cannabalize themselves?No matter what, they'll deplete resources and have the capacity to harm you and your rich friends by getting angry and revolting.This plot hole makes the story pointless.Moving forward, Captain America begins his march of death up the train cars and starts fighting with the storm troopers. Right then I thought ""why don't the ""powers that be"" just unhook the car from the rest of the train? Let it slide off the tracks into oblivion. Problem solved! That way the rich people can get back to partying in the night club or whatever it was that they liked to do.Roll the credits!!!! We have the most mediocre Short Film Ever! Last but not least, the ending was ridiculous. It's supposed to be so cold no one can survive outside yet the woman and her child walk off the train after it crashes and don't freeze.Sheesh, this may be the BIGGEST plot hole in history.

In the train, there is still a division between 'classes' like societies always had had, and of course, the poorest people are treated like slaves. The setting of the movie is not realistic at all and can be assumed to just be representative of certain aspects of the society. However, watching the unique setting of different carts of the train is very amusing. There are carts for entertainment, for leisure, for food, for education, etc. It's very appealing visually. Also, the movie carries the important message of how greed kills and how one must fight for their own rights. It's also a great movie for action or thriller.

The plot, characters, everything about it was totally unbelievable and impossible to relate to. By the time a main character started describing his tragic past, it was so over the top that we would have laughed if it wasn't so gross. I gave it 3 only because I reserve 1-2 for movies which are completely offensive, misogynistic or racist, or just impossible to watch.

381,majoreasy,What a gem of a movie...,8,1 January 2014,"Love the movie.Hugely thought provoking and entertaining at the same time.There are some minor plot holes here and there but none were enough to detract from enjoying the movie. A 2 hour movie cannot be expected to develop all the characters like in a book, but enough information is given for the viewers to work out most of the 'unsaid'.Simply brilliant! One of few movies that makes me want to re-watch over again to confirm things I might have missed.The morale to me is simple: don't mess with things in ways we do not know how to recover from. We all have ideas on how life can be improved, but the knock-on effect might end up killing life as we know it. From the beginning, where an experiment gone wrong triggered the chain of events in the movie, right up to the end where most of the characters kept plugging away on 'missions' they believe is just and right, yet end up spoiling things on the bigger stage.Makes one wonder, is a shitty life better than no life? Do the privileged really have life so good? (And from who's perspective?) Lovely movie that asks many questions and provokes us to ponder them.Highly recommended for anyone who likes movies that make them think. (Surprisingly though, I think even those who only want action, bloodbaths and no thinking types of movies will also find this movie enjoyable.)I'd go as far as giving it 9.5 but the minor plot-holes gets 1 point deducted from an overall great movie...8.5 for sure...it's quite an experience...",Snowpiercer
382,peter-j-downey,Fun but underdeveloped,7,29 January 2015,"Set in 2031; 17 years after the collapse of the world's environment, a train holds the last pieces of humanity. This train, the Snowpiercer, circumnavigates the world indefinitely punching through the freezing terrain. From rear to engine the train maintains the previous world's inequality. But the oppressed are on the brink of revolution.Bong Joon-ho's takes a unique twist on the ""end of the world"" science fiction movie. Firstly it is set within a limited setting, where action can easily be forced on the protagonist (Chris Evans). Secondly it allows for little exposition to set up the narrative as the structure of a train lends itself quite easily to natural exposition, each carriage allowing for something to unfold. Finally Joon-ho also grounds the film within ""the now"", everything is identifiable making immersion straightforward.Visually this simplicity is maintained. Having one or two cuts during action scenes means that the eye can rest while taking in lots of information. Also having no breaks makes the set pieces visceral and tense. When the ruckus erupts on the carriage filled with soldiers you can see how fluid this style is. Also the conclusion to the film is shot so simply that the audience can purely empathise with the ultimate decision Chad Evan's character has to make and not be distracted by a bloated shot.But the minimalism of everything breaks down when it comes to the plot. Evans' character's motivation is trite; moving forward for the sake of moving forward. Also when the film is about to end we get exposition overload; characters begin listing off previous revolutions and we are exposed to so many past catastrophes that it warps the films narrative. This makes me believe that there was an awareness when finishing the script that Curtis Everett (Evans) had been underdeveloped.Acting in the film is sufficient. Being an action film most of the performances are quite physical, and since desperation is the main emotion in the film Evans, Song Kang-ho and the supporting cast feel caricature-ish. Tilda Swinton as Mason was the only standout performance. Being the villain Swinton seems to have fun; she plays up to the caricature, over-playing her accent and being flamboyant in movement and posture, in my mind she will be one the most memorable parts of this film.I enjoyed this film at the end of the day. The reason why is that it did things that other end of world film annoyingly overlook; there was multiple languages, societies structures remained unchanged, and everything was presented neatly and clearly. The flaws in the film never stopped my enjoyment, and I can see this film becoming a cult classic.",Snowpiercer

Really well incorporated mystery elements throughout and phenomenal storytelling in the beginning when we're thrust into an unfamiliar dystopia. Though there is exposition through narration, it's done gracefully and naturally, with the pace of information spread slowly enough to keep any feeling of lazy writing at bay.Confusion of the self sustainable nature of the train is acceptably answered by several of the carriages they pass through, allowing the layperson (myself) to comfortably suspend disbelief on the more nuanced scientific anomalies that come with housing the entire world's population in an enclosed train.The story itself is engaging and has enough twists and turns in it to make a case for itself as a little more than your generic young adult dystopian thriller. The social commentary embedded in the physical segregation of the train doesn't feel out of place.Also, Chris Evans, is phenomenal in this film. Song Kang-ho has a performance rivaling himself in Parasite, Tilda Swinton again kills it as a character who elicits nothing but disgust and hatred.Can't complain about much here, I think Bong Joon-ho did a really solid job with this movie and depending on which day you ask me, I think this may have been a more exciting film than Parasite.",Snowpiercer

Although some mildly interesting things happen and there is a little bit of good acting (I enjoyed Swinton's comic character), and the set design is great and CGI good, but thats all. The very concept of a perpetual motion engine indicates the level of intelligence involved in the making of this movie. Nobody told them that the only reason people talk about perpetual motion is that its impossible. I expected some clever loop-hole to allow us to ignore that, but no. It sounded nice & clever so they put it in, and that is the method used for everything in this movie. I.e. some schoolboys thought up stuff that sounded cool or emotional so they put it in. And everyone else went along with it cos of the dollar signs Similarly there's no attempt to explain who clears the tracks of avalanches and landslides or who repairs the tracks or the train or where the factory that makes the metal is. There may be a perpetual engine but does that also mean that the wheels and bearings don't wear down? Some people may say I'm nit-picking, but, I'm sorry, I can' help it; my brain stopped accepting that people run down the middle of a road to avoid being run down by a car when I was about 8 years old. I am an adult now and this film is for adults.Gets 4/10 cos its not utterly repellent, the set design, there is some watchable action and because it was a bold manga-esque idea (and bold ideas are to be encouraged if we don't want to live in a total desert of pop films).",Snowpiercer

But as they make their way down the train, I found myself eagerly waiting to see what the next car had in-store. It's almost like a good video game - with every 'level' being more intense than the last. It's actually, wait for it - enjoyable to watch.Evans lacks his usual charm, a bit miscast methinks. Jamie Bell is OK as a hyperactive sidekick, Hurt provides crusty wisdom. Little-known Ah-sung Ko is also great.But Tilda Swinton steals the show. My word, it took me ages to clock it was her. One person has described her as a ""John Waters version of Princess Leia doing a Thatcher impression."" which is such an accurate description, it hurts.

The freeloaders' clothing are tattered, their faces filthy. They somehow figure out how to shave. Huh? They should all have beards. This is a dark movie. Not dark in a sinister way, just dark. As in I can't see dark. It did get a little lighter after about 35 minutes when a window was opened. There are fights. When they fight the camera shakes.The freeloaders eat protein gel that is made out of... bugs I think. I couldn't really make out what it was made out of. Maybe it was explained later on in the movie. I can't tell you because I could only handle 45 minutes of this crap. The First Class tickets eat steak. Maybe they have cattle on the train. Who knows? What a stupid movie. In fact, it's a terribly stupid movie. The keepers of the train routinely do a freeloader head count. Why? Who cares? If the First Class tickets hate the freeloaders so much why don't they just kill them? They keep them alive and persecute them for unknown reasons. There are junkies on the train. The dope looks like silly putty that they somehow manufacture on the train. Good God, how did I manage to watch 45 minutes of this crap?

397,sean_pak215,Well-made art-house sci-fi focused on social commentary,7,1 May 2021,"This leaves me with the same slightly disappointed feeling that Bong Joon-Ho's The Host and Okja did. All three of them are astonishingly well crafted in a technical sense. Really, every single frame of Snowpiercer is immaculate; you can immediately tell that Joon-Ho is a natural behind the camera. However, something about the writing and pacing of Snowpiercer, The Host and Okja holds them back compared to the filmmaker's best movies, which are closer to mysteries and black comedies (Memories of Murder, Mother and Parasite). When he's working with a more naturalistic tableau, he can really knock it out of the park. But when it comes to more staightforward genre fare, the technical filmmaking remains peerless, yet the storytelling and overall experience lag behind.I've seen Snowpiercer four times now, and it has gradually improved for me after each viewing. But some of the same issues stick out to me. The pacing is a bit wonky, not smooth like Joon-Ho's best work, but more of a disjointed fast-slow-fast-slow rhythm. The message and themes are a bit too on the nose while sacrificing some storytelling (whereas Parasite or even other science fiction allegories such as Robocop and Wall-E contain better balance), and the overall experience feels a bit empty to me each time.Still, for what it's worth, the film is also strikingly well-made, unique, violent, mostly fun, and fairly unpredictable (especially for its concept).",Snowpiercer

It's an apocalyptic thriller action and if you overlook ridiculousness of the apocalypses itself and accept the fact that all humanity managed to fit on a train, then you can enjoy. Chris Evans was good, Ed Harris was good as a villain, action was good, I liked the twist when Ed tried to seduce Chris into being another Chief Machinist, BUT as soon as they showed that they need children to run the train, everything just collapsed. It is a self-sustain piece of machinery that is supposed run around the globe. The rebels were marching from wagon to wagon and there was classrooms for children, orchards, fish tanks, sushi bar, whatever you can imagine BUT there was not a single repair shop. Even if they didn't have it at the begin, they were riding in this train for 18 years, couldn't they find or train some mechanics and engineers who could maintain and repair the train? Some parts have worn out, so instead of this worn out parts, they stuck little children who were sticking their hands into some hole, pulling some goo out and dropping down. COMMON, they guy who designed this train (Ed Harris) was a genius and the best solution to replace worn out part was to stick some tiny children there, really? An ordinary person can figure out something with an empty tin, couple of rods and a roll of an insulation tape to reproduce what these poor children were doing. I understand the reason for the story to put little children in a horrible situation, as otherwise Chris would very likely fall into the trap, but they could have come up with something better than replacing worn out parts with children.

Everyone laughed at it, so when he became the master who could determine the fate of others, he would stand high, sneer and test human nature, and proudly watch them fall.Wilford told Curtis that he was the first class guest Gilliam had been in touch with, and that in order to maintain the ecological balance in the train, the population must be kept at a fixed number, so in a few years it would be necessary to artificially incite a rebellion to achieve the goal of reducing the population, and such a plan had been carried out jointly by Wilford and Gilliam! Curtis was hit, and Gilliam was involved in a bloody and dirty deal, which meant that the god of his faith collapsed.But standing in front of both a gift and a curse, Curtis's reason slowly returned: divinity is only a glorious face of human nature, Gilliam is ultimately a human being, in order to maintain the ecological balance of the train, in order for more people to survive, people can only choose and can not use their divine power to redeem.Finally, Wilford came from an appreciation of Curtis, who wanted Curtis to dominate the wand, but Curtis found that the permanent motor was simply a scam that needed to shove children into the system instead of parts to maintain power.

The central conflict of ""Snowpiercer"" deals, of course, with a major class struggle, with most of the refugees hunkering in the ghettoized tail section of the train. The privileged few live in the front cars (I'm sure any similarities to the basic concept of the bus boycotts that started the civil rights movement are intentional), and the ragged masses congregating in the rear are sick of the oppression, and rebellion begins to foment.The de facto ""Everyman"" leader is Curtis (Chris Evans), a taciturn fellow who quietly waits for the right time to strike. In the meantime, he acts as a big brother figure to his friend, Edgar (an eager Jamie Bell), while enjoying camaraderie with his fellow ""tailies,"" including sweet-natured mother Tanya (Octavia Spencer, an unexpected but wonderful addition to a dystopian drama) and wizened elder Gilliam (John Hurt, always expected and always welcome in a dystopian drama). Almost immediately, this feels like a futuristic retelling of a drama set on a train bound for Auschwitz.Indeed, any time the boat is rocked, Gestapo-like representatives from the front come to admonish the poor, huddled masses. They are headed by Mason (a wickedly over-the-top Tilda Swinton, who might very well be the most fiery character in the film), who seems to relish in her duties, which include forcing miscreants to shove their extremities into the frigid wastes while praising the all-powerful Wilford, the ""Big Brother"" figure of this story who inhabits the very front of the engine. Wilford also seems to order the cherry-picking of certain tailie children, never to return. Eventually, Tanya's son is taken, which sparks the revolution, which encompasses the first half of the film with vicious, ""Oldboy""-esque brawls and rapturous moments of rebellion (there's one scene involving a kid running through darkness with a fiery torch; I swear, all it needed was a Vangelis score to complete it!). Once they have gained the upper hand, the rebels enlist the help of an drugged-up Korean engineer (Kang-ho Song) and his daughter to help them in their quest for the front.""Snowpiercer"" is beautifully imaginative with its rather simplistic story, and indeed, Bong Joon- ho gets to assemble a hodgepodge of dystopian bleakness and utopian bliss. Full credit to the set designers for creating distinct ""levels"" the further up the train our heroes go. And indeed, the Holocaust references really do hit home as the film goes on. One car, for instance, involves children being indoctrinated about how great their glorious leader Wilford is with a Hitler Youth-esque sort of rigmarole. Indeed, the fact that the cheeriest spot in the entire train is the potential source for future atrocity and oppression is made abundantly clear, and the pregnant, propaganda-spewing teacher (a beamingly insane Alison Pill) is ten times more terrifying than the axe-toting guards sent to subdue the revolt.Chris Evans makes for a wonderfully stoic protagonist, and even though the role could easily fall into bland territory, I feel that his inherent ""American""-ness that made him a wonderful choice for a certain Marvel hero hearkens back to the days of Charlton Heston. That said, he gets a heartfelt soliloquy in the end that stands as his finest bit of acting to date. The rest of the ensemble fleshes out their characters quite wonderfully; special mention must be made to Swinton's slimy Goebbels-esque surrogate, Spencer's lived-in dignity that aided her so much in ""Fruitvale Station"", and the appearance of a certain actor at the very end that puts a face to Big Brother at last.There is naught a dull moment in ""Snowpiercer""; by the halfway mark, so much has been packed in, and yet at the same time, it never feels too much. Harvey Weinstein wanted to cut twenty minutes of footage from the film and add a voice-over. ""Snowpiercer"", like ""Blade Runner"" thirty years before, isn't as inaccessible to audiences as one might think. It knows exactly what it is, exactly what it wants to be, and exactly how to show it. It may lack the spit-shine polish of ""Blade Runner"", but it makes up for it in sheer grit.",Snowpiercer
412,john_hugo,A train wreck of a film.,1,29 October 2014,"Warning: contains spoilers.I decided to watch this film, because of all the positive reviews. How anybody could give this piece of garbage more than 2 stars, is beyond me.I really liked Joon-ho Bongs' Korean blockbuster ""The Host"". And in particular the Snowpiercer actress Ah-sung Ko, who played the young girl in the Host. And I expected more from great actors like Ed Harris and John Hurt. But nothing could save this ridiculous movie. The train cars were much bigger on the inside, than the outside. The path covered the whole world. Why not just go around in circles in a smaller area. Where did they get the beef and chickens? Where was the feed for the animals? Why did the super high tech train need 5 year old children to operate?The prison was just drawers, where they froze you, with no apparent side effects. Why feed them cockroaches and where did they come from? Why not grow something else: anything else to feed them. Nothing in this film made any sense.I think the most stomach turning scene had the Chris Evans character talking about how all the people in the rear were starving, so they started voluntarily chopping off their limbs to eat. (And that babies taste best.) So the owner of this amazing high tech train, who willingly let everybody on, did not even think of food? This film is just awful.",Snowpiercer
413,blossoms-733-387580,Original Original Original !,9,24 July 2014,"Did I mention original? If you like action-packed, gory, science fiction, futuristic movies like ""The Hunger Games"" this will be your cup of tea. Or if you're a die-hard science fiction fan like me who loved ""District 9"" you'll enjoy this too. This is in no way like a Hollywood movie-- it is not cookie-cutter, formulaic, or afraid to take chances. Instead the Korean director, Bong Joon-ho, created a loose adaptation of a French graphic novel, ""Le Transperceneige"". The story is set a few decades in the future. The world has suffered a massive environmental catastrophe and everyone has died except for those who managed to climb aboard a train that travels perpetually around the world. The train is powered by a perpetual-motion engine (truly science fiction because such an engine would violate the first and second law of thermodynamics). This is an intelligent and action-oriented movie that will appeal to both mainstream and art house film fans. The characters don't fit into any stereotypes--they are overweight, elderly, Asian, black, masculine (women), and some of the crazy party-goers in the upper class cars are just gender ambiguous. What I loved the most was that this movie is unpredictable. You usually have some idea of what happens next in a Hollywood film. You will have no idea what happens next in this one! I am surprised this film has not been widely shown in US movie theaters. It has all the makings of a blockbuster.",Snowpiercer
414,Gobobo,"Things that make you go ""Hmmm..""",5,20 October 2021,"This film is all over the place. I couldn't work it out if it was a disaster flick, a survival one, a comedy (parts are pretty funny), an action movie, a political satire, or an apocalypse thing. It's a bit of a mish mash of genres, doing all of them moderately well.Some parts, such as the chicken eggs and sauna, are more a part of Korean than western culture. I imagine a lot of the other references flew over most people's heads (including mine), so it's some of the viewers' lack of knowledge which provides a part of the confusion. At other times, it just. Makes. No. Sense.Where did all the meat come from? They'd need a farm, somewhere. Why was anyone over child-rearing age allowed to live in the rear of the train, when the overall population was allowed to grow too much? They only wanted to take small children who could fit in the engine compartment. How come the train had to keep moving? The perpetual engine supplied all of their power. Why hadn't global governments survived in bunkers? Or did the train not have a radio?Lastly, why was the appearance of a polar bear at the end greeted with optimism? I can't think of a worse animal to be face-to-face with in an arctic tundra - it'd rather eat you than not.",Snowpiercer

Reasons for this movie as a total disaster - 1) It's ""technically"" and ""naturally"" impossible to create a train like this which can keep running for 17 years or so without stopping. 2) The track of the train is shown as pan world.... think for a moment - Can someone make railway tracks over the entire ocean & ice????? 3) There is no ""logical"" reasons behind how the people are getting resources to keep living without train getting stopped. Sometimes dialogs used in the movie are not impressive and people have stupid expressions and characterization. 4) The script itself is so weak that you just don't get involved in it. It fails often to generate any excitement/ emotions etc as the script progresses. 5) There are more reasons for which i could not get the best words to describe!CheerS!",Snowpiercer

A fan of The Host, I knew this director could blend the absurd nature of the topic into an interesting topic. What I forgot is that he has this way of making optimistically bleak endings. Genuinely, this movie is transcendent in its message, are we stuck on an endless loop? Do we ride the same history and violence because we need too? what would happen when the day comes that someone decides to change the ""status quo""? All this is very meaty food for thought but sometimes not the reason everyone will go see the movie. Hopefully the one released stateside hasn't been edited and you see the beauty as well as horror of humanity. Some positives? -Very well shot. You could feel the immensity of the train juxtaposed to the claustrophobia they must feel. -acting. In all its ridiculousness, i never felt like anyone was ever overdoing it. Seriously, even with Tilda Swinton's caricature of a person, she was spot on in the insanity of her part. Some negatives? -The ending. Like I said, this guy makes bleak optimism or optimistically bleak endings.

417,bobbystryker,"Can Captain America captain this crazy train ride, or are we gonna have a runaway train wreck on our hands??? Read our Snowpiercer review to find out!!!",8,6 July 2014,"Rightfully so, this movie has been getting a lot of buzz and I was fortunate enough to be able to get my hands on the Hong Kong Blu-ray release of the movie prior to its formal release in the west.For once, here is a movie that really lives up to the hype and expectations. It's easy to see why it's earned a super high 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie, made on a paltry $39million budget, has already grossed $80million worldwide and it hasn't even been released yet in most territories!The premise may sound far-fetched but it makes for some compelling cinema. In 2014 (yes 2014) scientists attempt to combat global warming via a special weather experiment. Inadvertently the world is plummeted into an ice age and all life on the planet is brought to the brink of extinction.The only human survivors are on board a special train called the Snowpiercer. A huge train designed to survive the harsh environments of the frozen world. Running on a perpetual-motion engine, the train has to keep moving otherwise it risks freezing and killing everyone on board. The train track goes around the entire world with one complete revolution of the track taking a full year.On board the train is a full self-sustaining eco-system with food, water, fish and animals. Sounds nice if not for the most extreme class system divide you will have ever heard of. The rich elite enjoy an opulent lifestyle at the front while the poor go hungry and live in squalor in the rear of the train.We are given a glimpse of the hell they have lived in for 17 years and the oppression is extreme. No real food, dirty, dark, damp, rusted and cramped quarters. It's a suffocating hell with no obvious way out.But the poor have not lost hope, they dream of a revolution, of over powering the bad guys, reaching the front of the train and taking over control. The rebels are lead by Curtis Everett (Chris Evans) and elderly mentor Gilliam (John Hurt) as they go after Wilford, the train's creator living at the front of the train. Additional help comes in the form of Namgoong Minsu (Song Kang-ho), who helped to design the train, and his daughter Yona (Go Ah-sung). Interestingly, they also played father and daughter in the director's break out movie The Host.But this isn't going to be an easy ride, no previous revolution attempts have succeeded and in addition to the numerous carriages that separate the front from the rear, there are hundreds of guards and soldiers.Can the good guys prevail?? Watch to find out!!!From the director who brought us the fantastic Korean monster flick The Host; Joon- ho Bong now brings us a mighty fine thriller in Snowpiercer. Based on Jean-Marc Rochette's French graphic novel series Le Transperceneige. Reports are that Bong read the entire comic cover to cover while stood in one of his favourite comic book shops in 2005. Did he buy the comic?? Who knows! What we do know is that he was fascinated by the social class system on board the train and the unique dystopian tale of confined, extreme social stratification. Needless to say, he wanted to turn it into a movie and here it finally is!Korean movies can be pretty great. There are classics like Old Boy, My Sassy Girl, The Host, A Bittersweet Life and even hit TV shows like My Love From Another Star (stay tuned for my review). Snowpiercer is the first to successfully bridge the Asia / West divide; it's a successful intercontinental collaboration, featuring notable actors from both sides of the globe.The film is a tense gripping thriller from start to finish with powerful performances throughout. Captain America in particular, once again proves his acting chops in a powerful scene at the movies finale.The unique setting of the film gives everything a very tense, claustrophobic quality. It is undeniably Korean in flavor but should still be readily accessible to western audiences. Think of the movie as a superior version of Hunger Games made specifically for adults. Agreed special effects of the frozen world could perhaps have been slightly better but this should not detract from your overall enjoyment of the movie, especially as most of the scenes are in the train's interior. Also worth noting is that this is not an action movie per se, it's not Captain America 3. Think of it more as a damn good thriller with a few cool action set pieces.Snowpiercer is well worth your time and money. Get your hands on it, find it on the big screen, get the Blu-ray, and watch it any way you can – you'll thank me for it later!Enjoy!Rating 8 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",Snowpiercer

Can't hate it, can't love it, even though, according to the extreme reviews I saw here, one of those was to be expected. The logic does not hold up very well most of the time, so you try to enjoy it as some kind of strange riot action-movie. Then, you get some dark humor, and you try to view it as comedy. When you think you can sit back and use that watching glass for the rest of the movie, it suddenly gets deep, and all psychological on you. And you say ""Hey! I know, it's a drama! I see Greek mythology here!"", but then... it's the Matrix all over again. And then some older characters pop back into the storyline, focus on them, just to tell me utterly nothing at all. And then, it's the ending scenes... - what to make of them, I really could not understand. But then I remembered - Yeees! It started out as a ""POSTAPOCALIPTIC TRAIN movie""!

then 5 years old baby all kidnapped...

Inexplicably, the axe gang that cuts the fish, seeing superpowers, did not explain it in the end. The rebellion process stopped again for the New Year, and stopped to eat sushi, can you feel a little urgency. Once the sense of absurdity and reality is unbalanced, it is uncomfortable. From the exaggerated small classroom, I found that I ca n't look at it with normal thinking. The cars behind are not reasonable. The protagonist wastes bullets as a leader, kills hostages, and loses control of emotions at the door ... Then it 's really unimpeded by one person, I still I thought there was an army behind. I didn't expect the villain to appear only when it should appear, only to kill the people who should be killed, but to disappear when it shouldn't. In the end, the conspiracy to maintain balance is too nonchalant. Tossing it directly out of the train will be done, or family planning. And the people at the bottom are just waiting for death to eat mixed food, at least arrange a setting to exploit labor. There is also the one who blows the car door.

But the rest did not make any sense whatsoever. Why would anyone - Major Spoiler coming up!!! - would actually manipulate a revolution inside the train, just to handle the populations, and not just stop feeding them till the numbers are right again? Or why wouldn't they just kill off a bunch, one by one, since they had bullets and all... Also, the almighty Wilford could not comprehend that a local hero from the tail section would never be interested in taking his place in front???Regarding the directing, seems like he did not really know where to go with it. We had some Charlie and the Chocolate factory funny and weird scenes (and the whole Tilda Swenton character which I remind you saved the movie), and you had that villain like Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men, who actually resurrected just to die a scene later without actually adding anything to the rest of the movie. We also seen some Oldboy fighting sequences. The influences were not carefully blended together in the mix.I will not bore you with smaller plot holes though, or stupidities and utter bullshit to be more accurate. You are intelligent beings and you probably wondered about them yourselves. If not, you probably gave this movie a 9/10 which is totally not worth it. A 5/10 is more like it, since it is an enjoyable movie, but leaves you wondering how much time the scriptwriters spent on writing the actual script and not just developing a simple idea they had while the movie unfolded.",Snowpiercer
429,bruninho-loopes,Get ready to train your suspension of disbelief,6,17 June 2021,"This show is okay. It's fun to watch when you've already seen everything you wanted to and now want something just to pass the time while new seasons of your favorite shows don't come out. I don't see it becoming anyone's favorite TV series, and I think it takes itself way too seriously. The impact phrases in the beginning that always end in ""the eternal train, 1,001 cars long"" or something along these lines gets really repetitive and tiresome after the first 3 or 4 episodes, and sounds super obnoxious and out of place most of the time.There are far too many plot holes in the storyline, too, so, as the title of this review says, get ready to train your suspension of disbelief. Far too many coincidences, and too many obvious things. For example, how did no one know that Melanie was Mr Wilford for years? It was so obvious from the first 10 minutes of the show and they made it out to be a big reveal in the end of the first episode. Everyone with more than a couple of braincells wasn't surprised by that.Overall, it's a watchable show, but don't put too much thought into it and don't go into it thinking it's going to keep you at the edge of your seat - it's a sci-fi full of cliches whose writers don't seem to want to go the extra mile in order to make it great. It's full of unnecessary gore scenes that don't add anything useful to the storyline and devoid mysteries, as the story fails miserably in surprising the viewer.

430,glennmeerten06,Not pulling any punches,9,16 August 2014,"This movie is relentless. Right from the start you're confronted with the most inhumane scenes you've seen in a long time in movies. You can feel the hopelessness as the ""tail section"" struggles to survive. The aggravation towards the upper class really hits home when a member of this upper class literally starts talking down on these people. ""We are the head, you are the foot. Know your place, so it is."" You really start to get rallied up as you watch these scenes. You want to start a riot with these people and take over this train! Not just the scenes but the acting do a fantastic job pulling you into that train. This movie isn't pulling any punches. At the point where you hate those upper class people with a passion, the movie throws in a twist that just about knocks you of your feet. There are several twists actually. The first one presents itself when Curtis (Chris Evans) gives a heartbreaking, chilling story about what the first months in the tail section were like. The other one I won't say anything about because what's so gripping about this movie is that you keep wondering what's in the next section of the train and if they'll live long enough to see it, let alone make it to the front of the train. The action scenes are very creative and unnerving. It was weirdly eerie to see the guards interrupt their hacking on the passengers to celebrate new year's. The CG effects aren't the best I've seen but given the budget (39.000.000) they did a good job. And yes, the budget isn't that substantial. The fourth installment in the Transformers franchise had a budget of 210.000.000 dollars and that's evident when you look at the amazing CG effects in that movie. But this movie has tons of what T4 lacked so much: personality!Curtis struggles with being a leader even though the tail section sees him as such, and as a leader he faces some impossible choices. And this is where the ""not pulling any punches"" comes back around. The choices he makes are surprising and have harsh consequences. This might be the most underrated movie of 2013. If you can't handle the unnerving feeling this movie will give you, don't see it but I guarantee you: if you were to watch it, it'll have a lasting impression on you.",Snowpiercer

Tilda Swinton is really hamming it up in her role, memorable for sure. What kept me from liking it more is it's just a little too gruesome for me. The violence was more than I expected. And I had a few questions about the logic (like how did they build an aquarium on this train?). Overall it's pretty engaging though.",Snowpiercer

Really awesome! the story was start in the future because of the global warming, UN create CW7 which make entire of the world freeze. All the survive mankind lived at the train. Analogy the world with the train is so awesome. it just came through my head like a water. Deep message and ideas makes me scared. Even so many blood in this movie, i felt so enjoy when watch it because the story has already get my attention first.As the movie whose created by Korean cinema, this movie was vet-over-my expectation. Love it so much. Chris Evans played very strong character, he shows deep emotion in this movie, especially when he confessed what he did in first 17 years on the train. Chris deliver more than in the Captain America 2: Winter Soldier, IMHO. I still can't believe that Chris can act like that of the screen though. The visualize of sections the train's compartments are so promising. Surprising and twisting.So, if you like movies with: Noir story, festival-typical movie, more blood, no nudity/sex scene and a twist storyline, i recommend you to watch this great movie.My verdict: 10/10",Snowpiercer
438,thtsme,Very entertaining,9,29 December 2014,"The movie plot starts with a more or less original setup. Due to global warming humans decide to use a cooling substance on the atmosphere to reduce temperature. This does not work as expected and ends up freezing the whole world, making it uninhabitable.About 15 years later, the only survivors live on an eternal train, that runs forever and never stops. The train is built as a full ecosystem, providing everything the people need. A cast system is also imposed to satisfy the various tasks required to keep the train going.The whole thing is an obvious metaphor of society, reducing the world into a small environment so that we can associate the various groups of society to individuals and feel attached to them. The metaphor seems about a man on the lower levels trying to climb up the ladder of a very structured society, nothing new here.It is not a movie with a message only, though. The acting is excellent, all of them. The setup is that of a post-apocalyptic era and the picture is very dark for most part of the film. Lots of shadows, gray, black and white, with some contrasting bright colors every now and then. The colors at times reminded me of The City of Lost Children. There's some small glances at the beautiful landscape, with gorgeous mountains packed with snow.The directing and cutting is very nice, often combining very close up shots with wider ones in a sequence, giving more power to the great performance of actors and actresses.Many things seem to be extinct and we are not shown a huge display of future technology. Instead it is very realistic, most of the technology we see is either very similar to what we know or simply extinct.The characters are credible and diverse though based on classic stereotypes, portraying the lowest society levels very natural and realistic, with feelings and emotions most viewers can feel identified with. On the top of the pyramid we are shown a man with a God-like plan. On the middle levels characters are basically bureaucrats (with a touch of eccentricity).But the movie is not about imagining a future society, it's about a group of people on the tail trying to get to the front, and this ends up meaning action, fights and violence almost every time they get to a new wagon. Yet, it is not only an action movie either. Fights don't feel like pointless visuals, but they are rather violent actions embedded in the plot.A plot that has well built dialogs that help you understand what moves each character. It succeeds in combining moments of action with moments of drama.The way they deploy the plot is intriguing. Only the idea of knowing what's in the front keeps you interested. There's additional things, like some strange messages appearing inside the food and finding out why some people on the tail do get called to move to the front.The end felt partly as expected. Some general assumptions made early in the movie are in fact as they appear. But I wasn't expecting the details and the way the pieces fit together. It did surprise me and found the end had a nice twist.",Snowpiercer

There are many inexplicable aspects to the plot, which becomes clear quickly in the movie. The only way to absorb this story is to suspend your typical commercial expectations and take the ride, quite literally. The arbitrary vicissitudes of life, one's role, relationship to, and frustration with society, unfold in a bizarre and violent manner in this linear microcosm, showing our tendency to self-destruction, yet somehow still holding out hope. With an excellent and diverse cast the movie holds your interest, balancing shocking scenes with provocative ideas.

442,nesdon-2,Pretentious ugly mess,4,28 June 2014,"I had observed that I have always loved any film that got over 80 from meta-critic here on on IMDb. A little more generally, factoring in teen action and or crush excessiveness, that those above 7 from the public would be enjoyable. But this in-your-face preposterous allegory has caused me to rethink my rule.I was ready to suspend disbelief through the opening VO claiming that all life was extinct, except a few humans on a train. Obviously completely ignorant of biology, tartigrades or other extremophiles, but okay, that's the premise, I'll play along. But they just stretched and stretched and stretched my suspension until, barely an hour in, it just snapped.Then the awful, washed-out cinematography, (with the Alexa as a choice, film, at least for hand-held lowlight work like this, should get deader faster) the ugly-over-the-top gray design , the relentlessly claustrophobic, though not at all evocative (a la Das Boot), and cinematically boring interior train shots along with the excessive latex and gore just wore me down.Then there's all the cheesy, fake-looking VFX exteriors of the train and frozen world. They did shoot some in Austria with a smidge of real snow and ice, which only managed to call out the bad CGI. This is the 21st century, for $40 million it shouldn't look like a Toho kaiju set.The one thing that sort of worked, and I guess this may be where all those millions went, were some of the performances, most of which I bought. Chris Evans, tho' nothing too original in his typical sulk, was still effective and well-suited to the tone. Octavia Spenser kicking ass was cool, Tilda Swinton and Alison Pill playing it big for laughs and getting them (thank you), but John Hurt and Ed Harris have stronger chops than they showed here, mostly phoning in a few days work. Okay, I'm willing to forgive a lot if they can wring a compelling theme or revelation out of the last act, as they did so well in Looper, but the climax here was as absurd and childish as all the rest. No deeper understanding of the human condition, no effort to reveal hard truths, uplift or edify, just a couple of puny chump-change reversals.I think the whole martial arts genre has been highly over rated, and maybe that is a bit of why this has such inflated ratings. Whatever it is, go see Edge of Tomorrow instead if you're in the mood for violent sci-fi action with poor (but at least there, forgivable) plot logic.",Snowpiercer
443,robert-rhys,Imperfect but Brilliant,10,19 July 2014,"The premise of Snowpiercer is certainly ridiculous. A train, barreling through the wastelands of a frozen Earth with the last surviving members of the human race on board. A class system has evolved with the rich and powerful at the front of the train and the unfortunate masses at the rear. Through the course of this film there were numerous inconsistencies and implausible scenarios, yet the director (Joon-ho Bong) was able to re-engage the viewer time and time again. Scattered amongst these reckless flaws were several scenes of surreal brilliance with a final message so impactful and poignant to today's world that it is arguably unequaled in the history of film.",Snowpiercer
444,mojjen,Pretty and nice idea but no,3,28 October 2019,It was filmed very nicely and the idea for the movie could have worked and been somewhat unique but the plot was completely pointless and so many things did not make sense.,Snowpiercer
445,svanlijnden,On the Right Track,8,25 June 2014,"Snowpiercer posits an intriguing near-future scenario. It's the year 2031. To fight global warming, a chemical component was released into the air and things went horribly wrong. The world froze over and mankind is all but wiped out. Around 1000 survivors circle the globe on a giant railway track, in a self-sustaining microcosm aboard a train. As you can see, Snowpiercer requires you to suspend your disbelief quite a bit from the very beginning. Let's not be nit-picky and assume the inside of the train has indeed managed a delicate ecological balance that allows it to keep 1000 people alive indefinitely. Let's even assume that there is an engine that can keep generating energy without a clear source. The major hurdle is that a train could keep running in loops on a track without any upkeep to the tracks or to the outside of the train. Here in The Netherlands at least, a stiff breeze and some leaves on the tracks are enough to make the railway system grind to a screeching halt. The train in Snowpiercer has been zooming around non-stop for 17 years. That's not a feat of engineering, that's a miracle.In any case, this fascinating milieu serves as the backdrop to a social allegory. The people in the front of the train live in luxury and comfort, the people in the back are downtrodden and live in squalor. There has been an uprising or two, but nothing that took. Now another one is brewing, this time led by Curtis (Chris Evans) a man still hunky despite being covered in layers of grime. The scene seems set for a brainless action movie, but what results is more odd and thoughtful, despite there being no shortage of bloodshed. There are some beautiful sets as the rebels travel forward through the train, showing a world only about three meters wide that seems to go on forever. The acting from the upper class is over the top, with especially Tilda Swinton turning in an entertainingly batty performance. There is a bizarre, Terry Gilliam-esque feel to the second half of the film.The ending is downbeat, calling to mind scifi from the seventies. And the final shot is hopeful, but does leave you wondering 'Okay. So now what?' The story obviously doesn't really end when the movie does and it offers poetic closure more than practical closure. But for all the cracks in the foundation of this scifi story, it is entertaining and tickles the imagination.More of my reviews at PopCultJunk.com / Twitter: @PopCultJunk",Snowpiercer
446,tortillachips-972-975637,More then I thought,8,19 July 2014,"Wow, this movie was great! I totally didn't know what to expect. All I knew is that it had to be a Sci-Fi film of some sort due to my Sci-Fi club wanting to go see it. I thought the action was great and the storyline probable. If we came to something like this the have and have not would definitely be delineated. Mind games and tricks...sounds like politics now! I digress...I totally didn't know the lead was Chris Evans! He was fantastic! I love the mix of characters! You totally didn't know where the movie was going or if the main character would cave or not! My only wish is that I could have seen this at the AFI theater instead of at home! This would have been great on the big screen!",Snowpiercer
447,Blazs91,"Another post apocalyptic production, but it is different this time!",8,29 September 2014,"Another post apocalyptic creation dropped out by the movie industry. But this time, we could experience something different. This movie is not the typical, produced on an industrial scale, Hollywood action garbage that we are accustomed to. It is different! It has sense, emotions, metaphors and logical storyline.All my respect for Chris Evans! Finally ha successfully managed to leave the bad-ass Captain America behind, and he was able to depict a character blessed with much deeper emotions. The other actors, without exception, also did a fine job. There are some amazing CGI in the movie, but thankfully it is not stuffed with that. And what you can see is not the nowadays glossy and sparkling, even unrealistic imagery. Instead it is modest, plain, clean and believable.In my opinion, the movie endeavors to paint the differences between the social classes of the recent times in front of our eyes. And I think, it does really fine. As the poverty-stricken and vulnerable lower- class people taking their journey through the train, we have the opportunity to experience each level of the social ladder. We can face the ugly truth. We can see how the aristocrats live their exclusive and privileged life and how they exploit the poor people.There are some negative things (which are so few compared to the positive side!) which I have to mention. There are far too many characters and the movie continuously throwing them on the screen before we could have get the chance to know them. In addition, too many of them dies, and some of them too early. And if one of them went to his/her last resting place, then it would induce three possible emotions in the audience: 1. you would be sorrowful, because you cared very much for the character 2. you would be delighted with it, because you loathed the dying one 3. you would feel absolutely nothing, because you didn't have the chance to get to know the dying character passing away. And unfortunately the last one is far too common in the movie. And by the time we reach the end of the film, when had been forced to see tons of innocent and sinful people breathing his/her last, so that we would almost get accustomed to that. But the death and murders are illustrated on so brutal and shocking way, that it made 100% sure, that there would be some lucky"" people among the audience who would be scared to the bones and shivering while waiting for the final outcome at the end. So I don't consider a big mistake to stuff the movie with lot of characterless"" characters compared to the uncountable amount of positive things that can be realizes by watching this masterpiece.The positive side totally offsets the negative effects, indeed! Finally a movie which is free from teeming clichés! It hardly has an early predictable scene or even little moment, but it has many surprising turn in the storyline. Plus we can experience some really brilliantly visualized and narrated character developments. The creators did a remarkable job, because the movie is able to manage mysterious items on an excellent way, by rhythmically revealing more and more details. In the beginning I was was stuffed with numerous questions, and my curiosity has been almost totally satisfied at the end. The story left one or two plot-holes"" behind itself, for example how the hell that already dead guy could have stood up suddenly and regain his power immediately and continue his mission; or I think I'd never be able to comprehend how they could get so many cockroaches to produce food. And the whole we have to protect and preserve the ecosystem, so we have to eliminate a certain percentage of the people regularly"" thing sounded a bit weird for me. Because maybe this thing was the major reason for the apocalypse, I guess. But I'm not a biologist, so I might be mistaken.But never mind! The film is really enjoyable, and when you start watching it, you would be chained into your chair or bed by your curiosity. This is the movie, which could showed us how to make a masterpiece with without gigantic amount of greenbacks. Respect for the crew!So, this was my own personal experience about the movie. If you watch it, you probably would not agree with opinion, but that's just fine! Indeed! Everybody should see this production, because it can evoke wide array of opinions and thoughts, which can vary in case of every individuals, and THIS is the power of this movie!Thanks for spending your precious free time with reading my review! Hope you liked it!",Snowpiercer
448,eviltimes,Korean Garbage,1,19 June 2014,"Korean created shite with Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton, John Hurt, Octavia Spencer, Ed Harris and many more picking up a paycheck in this complete waste of time. After a chemical is released into the air to stop global warming, the Earth freezes and everything dies except for the passengers of a fantasy train that somehow runs forever without fuel or resupply. After 18 years of cannibalism and decrepit conditions, third class passengers in the rear of this immensely long train fight their way forward to the almighty Engine to confront it's creator and take control - to eat steak instead of the black jello protein slabs they're being fed. In the hands of an action film director or even more interesting - say David Lynch or Terry Gilliam - this film could have least been adequate entertainment, even something wonderfully bizarre - after all, there was $40 million to play with. Sadly it succumbs to the standard long drawn out bloody battle where you don't feel for the heroes or villains as no one is ever properly introduced as a character. Tilda Swinton is hysterical, and it's hard to tell if that's what they were going for or not. Captain America is a soulless rube who is used by the actual powers that be in what amounts to an exercise in population control. Ooops! Did I give away the big secret? :) No stars.

449,ericnhall,Disjointed and dull,3,11 July 2015,"The script was disjointed and simply didn't work. I am a fan of sci-fi and fantasy and have been for many years. I understand that a certain level of suspension of disbelief is required in order to enjoy these stories. However, this movie comes nowhere near a reasonable level. The entire premise of the train is just too stupid to accept. I'm assuming the book did a better job of it, and maybe a lot was lost in translation, but still, this movie failed. It looked high budget and obviously had big name actors, so it's inexplicable to me why the plot and writing were so bad. Why does the train have to keep moving? It's not like there's a schedule. The whole ending concept was ridiculous. There's a million other solutions to their problems rather then what they did. It's just an extremely lame attempt at setting up an Us vs Them, Have vs Have Not situation. The deal with the children was equally ridiculous. I understand it was an attempt to setup more conflict and make the Haves seem that much more evil, but it was just pathetic in the end. The whole explanation of why the Protagonist is so moody, his backstory, is also lame. There's just way too much wrong with this movie to spend time talking about it. The only reason to watch this movie is if you find Chris Evans attractive. I don't so I wish I hadn't watched.",Snowpiercer

It's not a post-apocalyptic fantasy - the kind you might expect from Roland Emmerich, and it's not a drama piece about dystopian future. It's a social metaphor - something that should be apparent from the trailer. It's about human nature and motivation. It's about social progression. It's about the journey that destroys and corrupts men who choose to partake in it.The ending, well, if you feel unresolved - come up with a better one. I dare you. See if you can make a better movie given the setting.All I care about is the fact that the vehicle works and exceeds every expectation. I was consumed by it. I loved every actor who pulled my strings. There was no confusion as to whom I was supposed to sympathize with and whom I was supposed to hate. The ""villains"" of this film - oh, they did such an amazing job evoking emotion while having little or no dialogue and even though it may look like they presented a threat, the truth is, the greatest threat main protagonist had to face was himself. That is the grand revelation - that is the engine. Not the mechanical part, but his own motivation set by a past experiences and suppressed memories.

BUT it's an entertaining ride (haha literally) and it had a point to make about ~society~ so it had to get a little convoluted to play into the narrative of an allegory for greed and wealth and poverty and society and all that jazz.

One so full of gaping plot holes especially the ""we have this experimental new gas that should cool the world down if sprayed into the upper atmosphere because global warming is just _that bad_ in 2014, no time to see if it has any negative effects"" (though all the 'frozen' scenes seem to show that there was no desertification and no massive pressure to rush ahead), I mean why not carry out small scale trials first. An experimental trial gone wrong would have been a much more believable premise than ""we're going to spray this into the upper atmosphere of 72 countries at the same time, you know; because we can"". Along with that we have people talking about how they ate people's babies but are completely disgusted when they find out their mystery protein bars are made from an abundant and never- ending supply of roaches.

I think so!So Snowpiercer is a movie from Korea directed by Joon-ho Bong about a train that carries the last remaining humans after global warming causes a second ice age.I'd been hearing good things about this movie very recently and saw it was only out for very limited release so I tried to find it streaming somewhere online since it wasn't playing in any theaters near me and finally found it.I have not been this emotional over a movie in awhile. I felt connected with so many characters so anytime a character died I felt actual sadness. They make the characters very interesting so that you get sucked into the movie.So whats our story? We have Curtis (Chris Evans) who lives in the very back of this train with all the scrubs. All they get to eat are these protein bars that look like blocks of jello and as you would guess, Curtis and everyone in the back are sick of living there and try to find a way to make it to the front. From there it's a race to survive through the many cars on the train till they can reach the sacred engine room.The acting in this movie was on point. This is a movie where I don't mind the slow scenes at all and I love when a movie can do that. Along side the great acting is an all star cast of Chris Evans, Ed Harris, John Hurt, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell and Octavia Spencer. Ed Harris plays the owner of the train and gives an amazing performance giving a speech to Curtis when he finally reaches him. With a budget of around $39,000,000 it really gets put to use because the environment outside the train looks great. Also the action scenes actually got my heart racing which is saying something considered every scene just takes place in a small room. Speaking of which, they were able to do some great cinematography with the little amount of space they had, especially in the back of the train where it was always crowded.It's enjoyable from the first frame to the last.

459,hamish-25851,Flawed genius,3,20 September 2015,"Artistically: 9 out of 10. Fun: 1 out of 10.There are some amazing ideas in here. The sets, the costumes, the lighting, the outside snowbound landscape - it all looks fantastic. The basic premise is compelling enough: it's a train that never stops, with a repressed underclass fighting their way up and forward against everything thrown at them by their privileged masters.Unfortunately not one jot of it holds up to any sort of critical analysis. As soon as the viewer starts to ask awkward questions, it falls apart. It doesn't have anything close to a sense of humour either. Quite a few of the characters are cardboard cutouts or even - and it is not often you see this - a parody of a cardboard cutout,a walking joke in a costume. By the halfway mark, almost everyone has started indulging in ludicrous behavior and / or acting like overemotional idiots. By the three-quarter mark, some truly ridiculous speeches have started to appear, then the plot itself (such as it is) clearly runs out of ideas and the movie paints itself into a corner.It's visionary, it's trippy, it's wildly eccentric and certainly has elements to it that I've never seen in another movie, but what could have been a great trick story ends up shooting itself repeatedly in both feet. This happens (repeatedly) because the director seems to be far more interested in making artistic points than he is in coherent, competent storytelling, or storytelling at all for that matter. There are attempts to rescue it, but they just add to the mess that results.I simply don't think that this director understands people very well. He knows about how to make something look stunning, but good looks alone do not a movie make, and once it was finally over I couldn't believe I'd wasted my night on it.",Snowpiercer

461,FilmAlicia,"Dystopian, surrealist mishmash, doesn't quite work",5,15 January 2017,"Caution: This review discusses plot points and contains spoilers, so don't read if you don't want to know about the film.I missed ""Snowpiercer"" when it was being screened at the AFI Silver Theatre, though it was there for several weeks, but based on the evocative title and the 95% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, I was expecting something special, perhaps even beautiful in a cold, 'dystopian' and surreal sort of way. Instead, I felt I was watching a derivative mishmash of films and directors that writer-director Joon-ho Bong admires, especially Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" as well as Richard Fleischer's ""Soylent Green"" and Peter Weir's ""The Truman Show."" While there is nothing wrong with being influenced, those other films worked because the actors in them played their characters straight, and the filmmakers themselves took their films (even cheesy ones like ""Soylent Green"") seriously.""Brazil"" may have blended ""1984"" with Gilliam's Monty Pythonesque surrealism, but characters such as Jonathan Pryce's 'everyman' hero confronted the strangeness of their world as if it were only to be expected. And, none of the actors in ""Brazil"" were as over-the-top as the weirdo villains in ""Snowpiercer."" Tilda Swinton's ""Mason"" is particularly awful. Swinton, usually a brilliant actress, appears to be playing Johnny Depp (at his silliest) playing Margaret Thatcher. Her every gesture and expression in the film made me cringe. The film's premise was also ridiculous, as many audience reviewers have pointed out. What about track maintenance, for one thing? If it was so cold outside that a man's arm could freeze solid in 7 minutes, how could they ever keep the rail lines in repair? And, if barreling through walls of ice and snow didn't derail the Snowpiercer, why would setting off a bomb do so? And, perhaps the biggest one, why would those running the train even bother to allow 'have-nots' to board the train in the first place, and having done so, why would they first allow them to cannibalize each other as if they were in the Donner Party and then start feeding them ""Soylent Green"" or ""Protein Bars"" or whatever they were feeding them? (I was waiting, in the scene with the protein bar ""chef,"" for Chris Evans' character to shout, ""Protein bars are cockroaches!"")The ""good guys"" in the cast were pretty good, especially John Hurt, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, and the two Korean actors, Ah-sung Ko, and Kang-ho Song. But, I didn't even realize until the end of the film that Ah-sung Ko was playing Song's daughter, not his girlfriend. (If she was his daughter, why the heck was he giving her drugs?)And speaking of the end of the film, didn't Ed Harris play essentially the identical character in ""The Truman Show""? (And, did my eyes deceive me, or did some of the people at the end of the movie appear to turn into zombies? Especially the chief villain, who appeared to keep rising from the dead after he had been killed at least twice.)Harris certainly did seem to be trying to convince Chris Evans'(""Babies taste the best"") character that train must keep running, the show must go on, and to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain or the reality outside the train (or outside this silly film). As Toto said in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Woof."" And, as Jim Carrey said at the end of The Truman Show, ""Good Morning, and in case I don't see ya, Good Afternoon, Good Evening, and Good Night!""",Snowpiercer

A story about redemption from the story of Curtis, who eventually would face the system provides an action-packed story with a deeper meaning.

466,Merang0,A beautiful and graphic derivation from classic genres that make it a masterpiece,10,6 November 2014,"If you are a filmmaker or you appreciate a film that is derivative of classic literature, history, and the class system, watch Snowpiercer!The concept for Snowpiercer originated in a french graphic novel ""Le Transperceneige"" created in the early 80's - a time in history when the Cold War was beginning to thaw, liberty was taking over the world, and the concept of pollution was turning into a global cause. Korean Director Bong Joon-ho (my new director hero) stumbled on to an illegal Korean translation of Le_Transperceneige in a book store and he read it in its entirety once he cracked it open. I've been extremely fortunate in my life to study films from around the world since my mother taught literature and film, and wrote a book on world cinema. Many of today's filmmakers will acknowledge influence by contemporary or modern greats such as the likes of Scorsese, Spielberg, Hitchcock, and Kurosawa, when they don't know any of the films that inspired these greats. Within Snowpiercer, first and foremost, I see 1925's USSR film ""Battleship Potemkin,"" then Germany's 1927 incredible expressionistic film ""Metropolis,"" and then France's ""Germinal,"" first put to screen in 1913, with numerous remakes, including my favorite version from 1993 starring Gérard Depardieu who's performance was brilliant. There are other influences, particularly some German films from UFA in the 30's and 40's, and topping off with an ending that's typical of the French New Wave.Snowpiercer presents poverty at its worst, a class system that is evil, and a time and place where industry has destroyed the world. This movie is amazing and brilliant. Not allowing this movie to have a wide release in the USA was a huge mistake, and the release company just had absolutely no idea or clue as to what they actually had. This film will slowly circulate and people will see it, and its brilliance will be eventually be known. If you ever have a chance, see the old films I mentioned. You will be shocked as to how the themes and concepts of these films have survived in filmmaking today.",Snowpiercer
467,Phantasy_star_4,Good idea perhaps or not?,3,8 April 2014,"I saw the trailer for this movie over a year ago and it didn't look that bad. So today I finally got to watch the movie and i have very mixed feelings on it. First if you are expecting this movie to make sense technically/scientifically or have a friend that likes to point things out just stay clear of this as you will or your friend will have a field day picking out the flaws as their are many. The scenes take way to long at times, maybe 50% of the movie is that way. From just people talking to one another to fighting. There are way to many slow motion captures and ridiculous camera shaking moments during fight scenes that lead you to believe the choreography was not very good at all to have to use that effect, plus it gives you a headache. The long pauses when people are talking especially at the end of the film before the last door was agonizingly boring and in no way suspenseful. You as the viewer end up wishing you were in control of the film as there are many instances were the main characters hesitate to do anything in strange situations. Scenes / Characters:I have already said that the scenes were way to long. Of coarse there are scenes specifically that really were not needed. Like the School scenes that seemed to go on forever. I understand it was used to let the viewer know how the train started and why they are their but even after the explanation you felt it was really hokey and stupid. A specific character i would like to point out on the bad guy side, gets his butt kicked at the start of the film and is pretty much a nobody. You get plenty of shots of him but he in no way seems a threat not even at the Guys with axes car, he gets beat easily, later midway threw the film he suddenly comes out of nowhere and is a huge force to be reckoned with, I think everyone that was watching this film with me at the same time cried out "" what the hell is this crap "" . I have never seen an under-developed character just start kicking everyone's ass out of nowhere. For example its like Bilbo Baggins randomly just kung fu fighting all the orcs by himself while the dwarfs just start watching like its no big deal. It was that stupid.The train itself:Only noted is that the train is self sustaining and the tracks all around the world are connected. Its supposedly beyond freezing outside and if you go out their you'll insta freeze. If thats the case how is the train still going? How is it that the rails haven't bent or snapped. Why hasn't the trains bent or become warped. Basically, you'll figure most of the movie out before it happens, the characters are okay but never feel really important. The story is not developed in a way you can follow most of the time. If you are to watch this movie just dumb down your intelligence a bit and go in with low expectations and it will be a lot more fun.",Snowpiercer

469,agitpapa-562-1441,A train to the end of intelligence,3,2 July 2014,"Other reviewers have outlined in detail the harebrained silliness of the plot and for anyone who has seen the Belgian-French comics it was derived from, no surprise there. The whole story is slapped together manga-style without a thought in the world for logic, plausibility, consistency, character depth, or anything else besides creating cinemascope tableaux (far too grand a word actually) from the original hand-drawn black&white comics.Promoting the 9th art (comics) to 7th has the reverse effect of demoting the 5th art (literature) to cinema (7th). Whereas making films from books makes cinema more intelligent, making them from comics makes it less so. That's why we end up with train-wrecks like this one, where nothing makes sense and there isn't a single real person in the whole movie, just comic book characters.However, that seems to suit the vast majority of viewers just fine. Zombies aren't fiction, they are real and filling up the movie theaters. Here's how to spot them: Show them a shot of a train several miles long zooming at breakneck speed over a snow-and-ice-covered railroad bridge whose steel is not only way past the brittle fracture point due to the extreme cold but also hasn't seen any maintenance for decades. If their reaction is ""Oh my god that train is going to crash,"" they still have functioning brains. If it's ""Wow cool man,"" they are zombies.If you do have a working set of cerebral neurons, you can't watch these post-apocalyptic manga-movies with any pleasure no matter how well-designed and shot the sets are because your mind is constantly reminding you how silly and pretentious it all is. Because the worst part of it, of course, is that these movies take themselves SERIOUSLY. But for the zombies, the harebrained pop philosophy in these movies (pop Marxism, pop Malthusianism, etc.) gives all the violence, gore, and caricatural goings-on they came to see just that touch of class that allows them to imagine that they have watched a work of art.",Snowpiercer
470,standsomething2,Unexpectedly bad.,2,4 August 2014,"The fact that this movie has a 7.0 rating, baffles the hell out of me. I went in to this movie with fairly high expectations, because it had relatively high ratings, and the trailer made it look as if it would be a good movie. Boy was I wrong. So much of the movie makes no sense, that it borders on comedic. I know there are some people who would say, ""its a Sci-fi movie, it's not supposed to be completely realistic'. But it isn't just the realistic world facts being so completely ridiculous. Its the choices the characters make, and the major plot holes, that make the movie bad. There are so many moments throughout the movie that leave you just scratching your head, saying ""huh?'.Instead of going through every moment like that, which would take more than I care to write, I will just give one example. The whole movie is centered around the fact that the world is too cold for humans to survive in, so the people on this train are all that is left of humanity. Many times throughout the movie, they touch upon this fact, and even go as far as to point out, as the train is passing a specific point on its round trip, a group of people that jumped off the train like a decade earlier, and only made it a few hundred yards before freezing to death in the places they were standing. Also making the audience simply disregard the fact that after a decade of constant snowfall, these people are still somehow visible, and not covered by snow....Yea OK. Then, after a 2 hour movie, where over and over they stress that if you leave the train, you will die, Chris Evans character, basically makes a decision to destroy the train, killing almost everyone that is on it(which as I said, is all that is left of humanity), in order to save one child from forced labor. So that the child he saved, and one woman, which is all that survived, could then venture out into the cold...to die anyway..? You also have to sit through the entire movie, having basically nothing explained to you. You are given virtually no explanations for things that should be explained, for the movie/plot to make sense. I.e., they mention over and over that the train can run forever, but never once mention how it works, or why that is possible.This movie, to me, had potential, and could have been good, but just failed on so many levels. That's not to say the acting is bad, because it isn't. The acting is on par, and it has a cast that is very talented, but a talented cast is not enough to make a movie good. The storyline and writing have to be good as well. And it just isn't. So unless you are the type of person who can sit down, and turn your brain completely off for the duration of a movie, I would stay away from this one.",Snowpiercer

However, seen as an allegory on religion, class stratification, revolution and even social evolution, there's a lot to be derived from the story it tells. I suspect it's one of those films that will seem more and more clever the more it is watched, though it works as perfectly serviceable Sci Fi thriller if you want to watch it like that. I was reminded tangentially of Kar Wai Wong's 2046, another clever film.Tilda Swinton, who is nearly as ubiquitous as Scarlett Johannson but has the virtue of appearing not to play herself every time, is very good as Mason.

474,daryahorenko,One hell of a plothole compilation,3,21 May 2018,"The plot of Snowpiercer basically goes like this: The opening text sequence explains that the use of some sort of gas has caused an eternal winter on earth, which killed almost all human life. The last survivors of the human race are on board a very long train. The people in the back of the train are being oppressed by those on the front who are in control of the engine and they're being treated like prisoners, so the people in the back want to get to the front to start a revolution. This was an idea with very high potential. Unfortunately a lot of very stupid things happen in this movie and it ends up being a trainwreck. If you thought that was a pun you're wrong, that's literally what happens. They chose to go with that ending.Let me explain to you the stupid things that happen in this third act. Throughout the movie, when our characters get closer and closer to the front, we see the living conditions of the parts of the train they reach getting beter and better. Finally they get to a HUGE door in front of the engine. For some reason, the last wagon before that is sort of a hookah bar, just with some other drugs, which is stupid enough by itself. Why would they put a hookah bar in the last wagon? I don't know what the writers were thinking. Even if we accept it as it is, I don't get why the people who smoke those hookah-like drugs don't try to stop our characters from breaking in. I really don't think they're THAT high.One of the revolutionaries is a Korean man who designed the doors for the train and opened them along the way so our characters can move further. He tells his daughter how to open the door to the engine room while he's occupied with fighting. They eventually succeed at opening the door. I suppose the government rooms that we haven't been shown yet are behind that door, right? No, it's just a dining room for the one person in charge. So where do the people on the train make their decisions, where do they have meetings, where are the government rooms? Nobody knows because the script is stupid! So a woman who works for the one man in charge gets out of the engine room and shoots the Korean man and there's no reaction from his daughter whatsoever. She then tells our revolutionary leader, the only other person left to come in because the man in charge wants to have dinner with him. Let me get this straight, how did our man in charge know there's someone outside that door? There's no windows. And why don't they lock the door after he comes in? Anyway, a lot happens during this dinner conversation, but this is where we get to the most stupid part of the movie: The man in charge tells our revolutionary leader that he wants him to be in control of the engine because he's old and he will die soon!? Why in the world would he do that?? Why in the world would he give control of the engine to this man who just tried to overthrow him?? As the snowpiercer represents all human life left, what in the snowpiercer were the writers thinking? If you think the man in charge were fooling our hero, that's never shown! For what I can tell he's serious! Even if he were joking, letting him come in in the first place is a huge risk. As he says, he's the only person to ever walk the entire distance of the train (Seriously? The staff never did that? Then how do they enforce orders from the front in the back of the train?), so he will know how do defeat him. But that's what our """"""villain"""""" wants, we're supposed not to concern ourselves with this plothole. The Korean man, who told his daughter to place a bomb at the door,... Hold on, why do they have to blow up the door? It's already open! Anyway, they place the bomb and blow up the door. I guess because it's not explained, rather vaguely implied the bang of the explosion triggers an avalanche which hits the train and causes it to derail. Everyone except the Korean man's daughter and a little child that has been taken from his mum at the beginning of the movie die. The two eventually wake up. The two leave the train for the first time in their lives, which is a really beautiful idea, Unfortunately, that scene also falls apart when you think about it. Earlier in the movie we've been told that some years ago a few people left the train and died of the freezing cold after what looks like 300 meters (0.19 miles). This means the last surviving humans will die in a minute and humankind will be extinct. But let's go back to this scene. They see a polar bear on a hill very nearby and smile about it in amazement of seeing an animal for the first time. But girl, polar bears eat humans. That thing is looking right at you. You will be eaten. Run! Run far away! Anyway, that's the ending of this movie.Before I get to my conclusion, let me point out some positive things:
1) This movie mostly has great cinematography. They worked very well with restricted sets and the movie looks really good. A notable exception is the frozen city they pass by at one point.
2) The performances are great, especially Ko Asung did a really good job. A notable exception is Tilda Swinton. Her performance was AWFUL.
3) This movie has some good protagonists. I like them.Unfortunately, that's all things that stand out as positive things about this movie that I can think of for now. In conclusion, the story of Snowpiercer had a lot of potential, unfortunately the script is one hell of a plothole compilation and the movie starts falling apart completely if you think about it. It has some redeeming qualities, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a really bad movie. If you want to see it, go ahead, but don't expect anything that actually makes sense. I don't understand how this currently has a 7.0 rating.",Snowpiercer
475,aurora-41206,"Lots of plotholes, unrealistic",6,24 June 2019,"Not sure what it was going for. On one hand, the guy's arm freezes off at the beginning (Andy's father?), but on the other, Yona and Timmy are fine when they exit the train. Also there's a polar bear - but wouldn't they have spotted this life on the train before hand? Was there any need to keep being on the train? Or was everyone senselessly evil? - And why was Yona a clairvoyant?? What was the point of that being added to the story?Why did Gilliam decide to be a spy? He knew he was stuck at the back for life. Why did they choose Curtis to be the successor? Everything seems very convenient. Of course Curtis would be the only one to survive. And if they needed to control the population, if they're willing to kill people, surely a form of birth control would make more sense and be more humane - I mean they have advanced technology - unless they're going for senseless evil again, which is entertaining, I guess, but unrealistic.The reason why I gave it a positive review overall is because the concept is interesting, and it tries to tell a meaningful story - of poverty, of the unfairness of predestined positions. The cinematography was great, and the depictions of different trains is very interesting; the concept is unique. I also loved the gate opener Kronole addict character; Curtis was also interesting in his moral dilemmas, but at the same time unrelatable in his antagonistic manner.Overall if you ignore the plotholes and pretend its an alternate universe, it can be an enjoyable film to watch. I would recommend it if you just want to cool down and see some action. Don't think about it too much because while it tries to be ""deep"" - it is cut off from reality and irrelevant to the modern world!",Snowpiercer
476,ioannites,A new vision of the Anti-utopia,8,17 November 2013,"Towards the end of the XIXth century, the literary and philosophic utopia does not have a place anymore in the universe of letters because all the earth was already known and the progress of the sciences and the technology with the evolution of the mentalities and the socio-political ideas tended to realize what the big Utopia's writers wrote in their literary works. These beginnings of the ""perfect"" State reminded us that the realization of these utopias would end only in the creation of the monstrous societies. This is the way the utopia as literary genre became anti-utopia, a new political and philosophic conception which leans on the science fiction, because these States cannot be placed any more on a lost island, but on another planet or in the future. The cinema was little inspired by this literary genre which is besides a part of the science fiction little inspired the cinema. However we have to underline the Nineteen Eighty-Four by Michael Readford according to the George Orwell's homonym novel. Towards the end of the last century either at the beginning of the XXIth, this literary genre begins to be less present, while dystopia express well the pessimism of the authors of science fiction. Leaning on these thoughts we can express some ideas which concern the movie Bong Jon Ho's Snowpiercer which certainly concerns violently some characteristics of the anti-utopia. It is about a work of anticipation but not at all about science fiction. According to what we have already expressed, this movie can remind us that it is about one against utopia. Knowing that this literary genre is a part of the XXth, century, a period favorable to the modernity and to the creation of a better world. These characteristics continue to exist in the XXIth century, but they are weakened well and the modernity has no more the same sense because it does not still include the idea of the progress. It is about postmodern period. The theme then of an ecological disaster thus terminates all these States and the humanity contents itself with a micro society limited in a train. It is about a new conception of its anti-utopia, but this time the pessimism of the director overtakes well that of against Utopia's because this totalitarian State of the train makes no more promise for a ""constructed"" happiness, but it limits to promise just the survival. At the level of other mythes we can well think of the Noah's Ark, but this time we have no more a Patriarch indicated by God to establish a new humanity, but devoid leaders of everything smells of justice and humanity. The results of this (society turn out catastrophic because it) not only the death of the revolting character, but the disappearance of this world. We can so think that there are four types of States who lean on the oppression: so we have the despotic States such as they were in past, totalitarian states such as we knew during the XXth century, anti-Utopia's states as those of the New Brave World of Huxley or We of Zamyatin and the nihilistic state of this movie which ends in the destruction of any human form of life. It simplifies the component elements of it anti-utopia because we more need propaganda, neither high technology which would aim at controlling and at erasing the consciousness of the individual nor the creation of a protagonist with a culture which would allow him to dispute this state. Consequently the creator of this story does not any more need to describe the political and social structures of this state as it is the case as well utopias anti-utopias. Both survivors of the second disaster could give us an idea of optimism, but the latter is only an illusion because all the elements of the creation of a new world are not given and it is doubtless a weak point of the argument of this movie. We finally have to underline an element of other novels between this movie and Aldous Huxley' New brave world. This remark could be considered as a coincidence but it is interesting to indicate it because we try to find the links which exist between it anti-utopia and this movie. The British author implicates Ford and we see him in a way parodied without this work. It we find him here also as an abstract but discreetly omnipresent entity. By considering these ideas which we expressed we notice that this movie is a continuity of it anti-utopia, adapted to the XXIth century but which does not lean any more on the science fiction, but on the anticipation which highlights a near future.If this movie is a shape of anti-utopia, however it would be very interesting to wonder about the messages that the author in the intention to pass us. Given that Michael Readford does not want to create scenes which aim at impressing the spectators, but leaning on this deep pessimism which we evoked with the presence of a social order which looks like a nightmare, we think that this film-maker tries to express some fears. Having the conviction that the theme of the ecological disaster does not really interest him, because no explanation justifies this hypothesis and we do not know why and how this train can save the last survivors, we can understand that this director tries to express some thoughts which concern the human nature. The fact that the disparities which create the hatreds and the hostilities between the human beings continue to exist even in these circumstances which threaten the existence of the man, that's what translates the deep pessimism the dimensions of which reach the limits of the nihilism.",Snowpiercer
477,Chrismeister,A claustrophobic tale on the woes of humanity.,7,2 October 2014,"Snowpiercer is a very unique science-fiction film based on a French graphic novel, however the narrative has been changed greatly for this adaptation. It is a film set entirely on a train in a future were the fight against global warming ended in a far more horrendous outcome for all life on Earth. The remainder of humanity have been left on a lone train circling the planet, waiting for the Earth to regain its once abundance and fertility. One of the first positive notes on the film is the very diverse cast, this helps it to be relatable to all audiences and for people, even those who won't enjoy this film, to at least find some form of connection to it. The performances were strong across the board from the kooky/comedic characters to the dark/brooding ones. Chris Evens who stars in this gives his finest performance yet, expressing a whole range of emotions that reflect not only the tone of the film but also the other side characters in it. The tone is the greatest element of this film for me, while it shows everything wrong with humanity and how given the situation we can be truly disgusting creatures, it also shows the bright sparks in the darkness. The train represents the Earth and the people on board are all of humanity, Chris Evens' character literally sees all of humanity from the determination, hope and faithful to the gluttonous, lustful sinners. Which the diverse cast helps to express. However this film does sometimes become a little too abstract and strange with little explanation. There is a visually impressive action sequence near the halfway point of the film, while exceptionally shot and realised, I was confused as to the choice of wardrobe design for the adversaries. All I could think of was the infamous scene from Pulp Fiction, and those who have seen Snowpiercer will know exactly what I am talking about. Other than these minor nitpicks, Snowpiercer is an remarkably well realised film yet not the classic Hollywood science-fiction romp which will turn people away, but in doing so makes this film something that is truly different for all the right reasons.",Snowpiercer

The last of humanity constantly travels around the world in a train, that provides them with the necessities for survival. The passengers on board are divided (roughly) into two classes: oppressors and oppressed. Naturally the oppressed, who reside under terrible conditions in the wagons at the end of the train, plan a revolt...The premise of Snowpiercer borderlines implausibility, but fortunately it draws you in very quickly and makes you accept it for the greater part of the movie. The characters are like- and hate-able as necessary, which allows the viewer to get emotionally involved. The tension curve rises well from the beginning, but after about two thirds in, the movie begins to drag on. The pacing in the last third is way off. Too much time is spent on philosophizing about the train, which obviously serves as a metaphor for the supposed inevitabilities of societal structures.

480,mg-soikkeli,A violent post-ecological allegory set in tech-noir train,6,6 April 2014,"Snowpiercer is an allegory of the global ecological situation set in a giant tech-noir train travelling around the frozen planet. Every carrier of the train is meant to represent a layer of society: poor ""tailers"", working class manufacturers, soldiers, rich owning class - but no middle class, which is typical for these kind of post-apocalyptic/post-ecological films. Surely the place could have been a space ship as well.Train as a prison for the last tourists of Earth and prison as a playground for rich man's politics, these basic ideas have been dramatised well enough, although the Korean mixture of playful violence and class allegory is also disturbingly stupid. For science fiction fans there are a couple of wonderful scenarios, but first you have to watch a lot of clumsy, overacted scenes to get there as if you were also a passenger in an unstoppable train. And there isn't any reason for a reasonable ending. ""Die Bewegung ist alles""? Allegorical references to class struggle are shallow, just like in ""Elysium"", another sf-movie about the post-ecological separation between lo-tech-poor and hi-tech-rich. You may have plenty of explanations what sections of the train are meant to directly represent some particular (national) society, but overall the manuscript is just a long, unbalanced combination of visual citations, especially from the French graphic novel.It is sad to see good actors wasted in this kind of brainless film, but then again, they don't have to do much acting for their thin roles. I can see that Jamie Bell is trying to earn street cred in films like Nymphomaniac and Filth and Snowpiercer, but I can't understand why Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris waste their time. Or did they really believe this film have some political profundity?",Snowpiercer

482,ozgkrl,Best movie I saw since a very long time.,10,30 March 2014,"This is my first, and I guess last, comment to any movie but ""Snowpiercer"" really impressed me. The Story told is fascinating and horrifying state in a surreal world where you will find yourself at the very end. I recommend this movie by all means. Take a close look and let the movie drive you through its world of density and total degeneration of a society as well the end of it well known in history examples, here it is very different in situation. I take my hat and bow in front of the director and his crew. If I would have any relation to the ""Show of Oscar""? That it is! How to talk about a movie and not telling anything about it just to fill some ""lines""? Well, I could go on to talk about the density and the excellent story told. From my humble opinion always was ""1984"" one of the best stories told about ours self. I have to say ""Snowpiercer"" will get a very high rank in my personal list of showing the disgusting face of human being. And what fits most is the speed. The speed of the shown degeneration because it fits so perfect in our degenerated world. Again. People, watch that movie! Have a nice day, Karl P.",Snowpiercer
483,ccponds,"Chris Evans; direct if you want, but keep acting as well!",10,7 July 2014,"Initially, this film struck me as a knock off of the ""Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"" (with the divisions of rich and poor citizens). However, watching this film, I thought of ""The Hunger Games"" maybe once, as I was so caught up in what was happening on screen. ""Snowpiercer"" is, on the surface, a story about the cast offs of society, who are living in hellish conditions, attempting to claim a better life. The rebellion of those living at the back of the Snowpiercer, a train that now provides the only means of survival on earth, is the focus of the story, and a thrilling adventure it is! It is well acted, well edited, well scripted, and so much more.When looking at the films acting, I cannot help but feel that Chris Evans deserves some sort of award for his part in it. His delivery was spot on in every one of his scenes, and I believed his performance from start to finish. For a guy who is constantly talking about directing, I hope that he continues to act as well. A lot of people are going to remember Evans for his role as Captain America, whom he has portrayed four times (five counting his cameo in Thor: The Dark World). But his role in this film was just as memorable as the one he has played in the MARVEL Cinematic Universe, if not more so.Of course Chris Evans is not the only thing that this film has going for it. The entire cast does a great job, and I credit some of this to the writing. Not only is the story itself excellent, but the dialog is also written well. Swearing I sometimes feel is a lazy way of trying to make a particular scene more intense, and it does not always work for me. In this film, however, it does. Whenever anger, frustration, or desperation is expressed, the swearing actually emphasizes it. And even the profanity has variation, so the audience will not have to sit through two hours of F-bombs.I will admit that the special effects of this film may not be the most impressive to be seen this year, but they are by no means bad. In fact, they outdid Transformers: Age of Extinction, a film that pretty much rides entirely on its CGI. But what ""Snowpiercer"" did not use in its visual effects, it more than made up for in practical effects and choreography. An example of this is a fight that takes place in about the middle of the film. I will not spoil how it goes down, but I will say that it does shows realistic fighting shots and couples them with excellent camera work.One last comment I would like to make, in regards to the films action, is that it shows the brutality of hand to hand combat. These scenes are harsh, but they are never ""over the top"" with violence. Yes, they have some truly gruesome moments, but then again, real fights are not exactly flashing swords and shining armor. This film emphasizes this fact beautifully, without trying to gross the audience out.Ultimately, as I reflect upon ""Snowpiercer,"" this is one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen. I did not really mention any of these moments in my review because there really is no way to discuss any without spoiling them. And trust me; there are a number of these throughout the story. It truly saddens me that this film is not being distributed more widely, because it is one of the elite films of the past few years. Is it perfect? No, but it sure comes close. This is one film that, if you miss it in theaters, you must see it when it becomes available on DVD, Blu-Ray, Netflix, or however you see your movies. Do not miss ""Snowpiercer.""",Snowpiercer
484,warriorspirit,Calculated for greatness,6,1 August 2015,"I only just saw Snowpiercer, and I want to share a few thoughts which is part a review of this movie a part a commentary on the questions this movie raised for me.If you didn't know that this movie was produced and directed by South Korean film industry, you would never have known this was a South Korean movie. Why? The movie is in English, the lead actors are all Caucasian, others are a mix. The story of the movie is based on a European, French novel. There are two supporting South Korean characters, so I guess that is a bit of a clue that it is a South Korean product - but otherwise you would not know unless you were told. This does spring up an interesting debate, does a film industry have to produce ethnically indigenous movies or can they produce movies in other languages with foreign actors? Second question is to what extent are foreign movie industries under the imperial influence of Hollywood/Western culture that they forgo their own culture and make movies to appeal to Western culture?The question above I will leave to ferment in the readers mind. In my my own mind I think it is a bit artificial. I would much rather see great South Korean movies based on their own culture and their own actors 3-Iron, Oldboy, Memoirs of Murder, than what I perceive to be a movie that is calculated to tap the Western market. At $40 million budget this is the most expensive South Korean movie made so far, but it does not entirely look it. What they did get right was the dystopic atmospheric lighting inside the train, which reminds you of Terry Gilliam(Brazil, Twelve Monkeys) and the production design of the interior train set is just right, with some really bizarre and wacky sets but brilliant lit, such as the indoor aquarium and the engine room. The problem area is the VFX, and of course we are going to compare it to Hollywood when it is consciously trying to imitate Hollywood, and in comparison the VFX work comes across as a cheaper imitation of Polar Express. The CG shots of the train, especially the aerial shots, make the train look like a toy train. However, by Asian standards the effects work is notable, and there at least some impressive vista shots of the frozen city outside of the train which are occasionally inter-cut into the slow moving drama. The vast majority of the movie is shot indoors in the train in movie sets. While, we know they are moving on a fast moving train, we never really feel the feeling of speed. This is because most of the movie is just wasted in loads of dialogue.The weakest point of the movie is the screenplay. The main plot of the movie is the underclass at the back of the train rising in revolution against the elite class at the front of the train, and as they make their way down from train to train they learn new things and encounter harder and harder challenges. Yet, we never really feel the struggle, because they barely have to struggle against any of the challenges, they just bulldoze their way through. They pass the first stage by simply overpowering the seemingly armed soldiers, by realising that they don't have any bullets because bullets went extinct --- the next stage they encounter soldiers armed with axes and night vision goggles, and despite the fact that they are out- armed and surprised, many of them still survive, when really they should all be massacred. The next stage they face an even greater challenge, soldiers armed with machine guns, so now not only do they have bullets, they have enough bullets for several machine guns. But like before our heroic crusaders erstwhile unarmed bulldoze through them, but with the numbers dwindling down at every stage.There are some really bizarre characters in the movie as well, that make no sense. There is a ninja, who does not utter a word, but somersaults into a scene at the right moment to defeat a baddie. There is a terminator baddie who despite getting stabbed and shot several times, and is able to come back to life and continue his murderous killing spree; there is a clairvoyant 16 years South Korean girl who knows what's behind each gate. Chris Evans as the hero is not believable as the revolutionary leader and his long monologues bore rather than inspire.As the film reaches its climax with the unexpected twist you wonder what the struggle was all about in the end, as our lead hero ends up crashing the train and killing everybody on board, including himself. Yet, despite the train having been thrown of its track into the mountains below, the weird 16 year old clairvoyant girl and a 5 year black boy survive unscathed and the final scene is them walking out into the snow in fur coats, and apparently it was cold enough outside to turn one man's arm into ice at the beginning of the movie. But at this point you don't really care about this gaping plot hole, after having walked through so many, as the ending credits start to roll.In conclusion this movie is trying to imitate Gilliam and to a large extent it succeeds in imitating his visual style, but it does not even come near imitating his greatness. Snowpiercer is too calculated to work with somebody like me, I can see right through it.",Snowpiercer

488,estebanlopezlimon,Willy Wonka's Capitalistic Train,7,19 September 2017,"Fortunately for me, I enjoyed Snowpiercer to the extent of feeling that my time invested was worth it. There's a lot of radical hate and radical love for this movie. I believe the former fact is more unfair than the latter. The most perceptible aspect of this film is the surreality of every scenario. That, I believe, is the most controversial quality of the movie. Those who hated the movie see the structure of the fictional universe with the logic of the real system, basing their opinion on how plausible is the world depicted here. This tendency is the biggest menace to the appreciation of the message. Some will counter such critical argument by appealing for its qualification of allegory, which I consider a valid reply. The way I see it is that the sheer fact of getting birth alongside our hero makes us as ignorant as he is. Thus, our confusion towards the rest of the train is valid. Curtis doesn't stop to understand how everything around him works exactly, he just want to get to the front and so we should. We share the situation of our hero, therefore we share his interests because that's what morality tell us to do. Discovering the bizarre behind every door is the charm this film. Getting to understand the social structure and not the technical structure of the machine is the key to enjoyment.7 estrellas de 10.",Snowpiercer

492,Evil_Fred,A flawed Gem,7,13 February 2015,"Though this movie is well crafted and i enjoyed it over all, there were still a number of things wrong with it. One being style over substance. The story is a bit predictable and it seemed like more time was spent on the look than the story. Even tho this is a sci/fi, it lacked credibility. Some things just seemed veeeery hard to believe ( like a train staying on track for years on years when in a few hours they nearly derail). Better to have left these out or to work them out in the story better.This movie is adapted from a French short (apocalyptic) story , also like 12 monkeys. Tho an entirely different movie, the concept( end of the world, how do we survive) is the same. In 12 monkeys it seemed like the story fitted the narrative perfectly, when in this one the pieces of the puzzle didn't seem to fit as well, with many characters who we don't care for and added visuals who just seemed they're there for the view. A few of the actors stand out, most notably Tilda swinton, but the rest seems like they-re there just for added star power. Also, the pacing was not all that, since IMO it could have been 15 minutes shorter.Tho it was a nice portrayal of class difference. An entertaining watch.Enjoy Evil_fred",Snowpiercer
493,aka-valkra,A very bizarre movie,7,26 July 2014,"I'm going to be honest, I did not like this movie that much until about halfway through. At first, it just seemed like bad acting but you slowly realize that it's just a very bizarre movie. A lot of the characters are weird, the dialogue is weird, the premise is weird, the different carts are weird. Some scenes like the club cart scene had me laughing out loud as the girl struts down the walkway with a bottle of champagne like a boss. Once you realize that it's just a deliberately bizarre movie, you'll start to enjoy it more. The movie's a roller coaster ride, one moment it's very serious and then it changes into a wacky thing in an instant. Not the best movie I've ever seen but it's definitely unique and original.

494,uselessDM,Difficult,6,23 November 2019,"This is a very difficult film to judge, because it has a lot going for it, but also a lot of problems in its very concept.
As a movie generally it works quite well, it's always moving forward (literally as well as figuratively), you know what the goal is and the visuals are great, the train looks like something out of the 50s or 60s and it really works quite well. Also the performances are up to par as well, so it has a lot you want from a movie. It's also fun to discover the sections of the train along with the protagonists. I think it suffers a bit from some tired tropes, but I really don't think that is much of a problem at all.The problems come in when you think about the whole concept of the film and the very idea of the train itself. It just makes no sense to have this train going if you just could use this incredible technology to build a settlement somewhere or just stop the train, which is just one of many points you can make against the whole concept.
They try to explain some things in the movie, but a lot of questions remain unanswered as well and that leaves you wanting a bit by the end, which is a shame because in a movie like this learning about the train and the world in general is a big part of the experience and it just doesn't deliver on that front if you really think about it.

The train, tracks, and bridges require NO maintenance, ever, even in the harshest conditions. Preposterous.4. Where do they get their fuel?

Preposterous.6. As we go further into the elite forward section, the movement of the train and the sound are conveniently absent. Preposterous.7.

When facing the choice between survival and human decency, it is hard to take side. But as they fight all the way to the headquarter of the train, it seems that it is the huge gap between the living conditions and the dispatch of resources that become the root of the problem.
The fighting scenes are full of tension and drama, and the shots are well-made with great acting.
The shortcoming is the logic of the plot and the setting.

It smells of crazy Korean movies like ""Old Boy"" with sudden twists, but it is too preposterous and silly for my enjoyment. There is one scene in particular that really bugged me: it took place across an impossible distance, but any more would be a small spoiler. The train crashes through ice and snow and flops along the tracks for nail biting suspense, yet it falls flat because it just looks ludicrous. I would have thought that suspending my disbelief would be easy after giving a chance to the ridiculous premise of humanity's survival depending on a perpetually moving train, but I was wrong. That premise actually seems semi plausible by the end, which could be from taking in all the insanity, however it could have used some editing or tweaking of the story to aid in the suspension. On the other hand I give it points for moxie and the strong team effort. The acting performances were good and even some of the over the top characters worked given the setting of years trapped on a train.

This is a Scifi based on a French cartoon and directed by a talented Korean director, starred by celebrity actors, but what else could I expect? But the conclusion I got after seeing the movie was the movie deserves to be called ""masterpiece"".The plot is hasty from the starting. The story appears to narrate how the subjugated tail revolts against the dominating head class sitting in the train. However, behind the plot there is cold-blooded insight about human nature and human society. Mason says, ""You are preordained."" The movie seems to proclaim freedom and equality. But I think the hidden point is, Mankind's evil side in a closed situation. Wilford says ""We need to manage a balance.""This is very provocative. When looking back human's history, how many dictators used this kind of similar logic? This question let me think about what is nation, what is human society again.Director Bong scams us by showing a ambiguous negotiation between Curtis and Wilford, instead, he shows us another glimpse of beginning. The last scene reminded me of ""Knowing""s ending. But not as religious as it.Beautiful acting of Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton, Ed Harris. Charismatic acting of Gangho Song, John Hurt. Sarcasism about high class people. Excellent directing, Enough room for discussion about the theme. Flawless philosophical sci-fi action thriller movie.

508,GAWeldon,A Wild Ride and a Great Character Study,8,2 November 2014,"Okay, a train racing around and around the world, carrying the last survivors of a frozen world... sure, why not? I like movies with crazy premises, as long as that premise serves a purpose. This one does, and I liked it a lot. In the end, it doesn't matter if they're on a train, or on The Love Boat, or on a starship heading through the Delta Quadrant at warp factor 9; what's important is the story of the people on board.I found these characters' stories fascinating. The 1st class passengers, the people who realized Mr. Wilfred was right about the end of the world, get the best place on the train. The steerage passengers were panicked people who came on board at the last minute, packed into a tight space like sardines. In that situation, over a long period of time, it's not surprising that a 2 tier system of haves and have-nots would quickly develop.Movies like ""Snowpiercer"" are supposed to make the viewer think. I spent a lot of time during the movie wondering what would have happened if those steerage passengers had been made part of the overall community, and a democratic system of government had taken over. Would that have stopped a lot of the bloodshed? Would it have endangered the entire train (especially early on) due to instability and uncertainty? How about if one of the earlier revolutions had succeeded? Would the steerage passengers, newly in control, have treated the 1st class passengers any better than they had been treated? What if there was a second train using the same tracks? Would one train eventually catch up to the other? What if, what if, what if? These possibilities, and others, made the movie even better for me as I watched.Chris Evans surprised me with a very good performance in ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" earlier this year, but his role here is even better. He has a monologue near the end that was absolutely heartbreaking, and he delivered it incredibly well. It also tied up several story threads that had been mentioned earlier in the movie in a very satisfying (and logical) way.The battle for freedom, for control, for life is a universal theme in stories, and ""Snowpiercer"" is an excellent example of this. I'm not going to quibble about plot holes or technology, simply because the human story this movie tells is so interesting and exciting. I highly recommend spending an afternoon watching this one.",Snowpiercer
509,adrien_ngoc_1701,Almost great movie but not convincing enough.,8,22 January 2019,"This movie has done a good job to build its own spirit which I do like a lot. Yet, it is still missing something...Given in the dystopia context where all survivors of mankind have been stuck in a moving train with perpetual engine for 18 years, the main theme is to reflect the entire human social stratification in one small train. From visual aspects, the crew had it delivered successfully. The overall dark tone with high contrast was perfectly set, the decorations of different wagons and the costume designs were exceptional. Therefore the biggest praise must go to the art department.
The main cast were also very solid with their performances. Chris Evans, with his heroic appearance, was the perfect fit for his character. Tilda Swinton was so original (as usual). Song Kang-Ho stood out between the Hollywood stars as a remarkable Korean engineer Minsoo. And not to mention another veteran actors such as Ed Harris (as Wilford) and John Hurt (as Gilliam) who also kept up their reputation even if it feels like they could've done more (I think mostly because the plot doesn't let them to).
The praise must also goes to Bong Joon-Ho for being able to make such an authentic dark Korean action drama with most of the main cast ""made in Hollywood"". If you really pay attention while watching this movies, you'll find a very typical tone or the set-pieces in some action scenes which are very similar to the legendary ""Old Boy"" of Park Chan-Wook.However, despite all of those good points mentioned above, there is still something that has been holding me back from giving it a high note: lack of script development and lots of plot holes. It's true that the illustration of the cruel human social stratification in that one train was very well executed, but all the elements that'd led to this reality weren't solid at all. It's like a magnificent castle built on sand. There were so many questions needed a logical explanation or even more works on script to be more convincing:
(SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!)
We could do so many things with a perpetual engine but why it had to be a train ? Even if the initial purpose of the train was not to save the humanity (because if it was, that would make no sense, there are so many other things which could be more useful to save humanity than a train!), even if the train was manufactured in the first place just for Wilford's personal desire, it deserves to have more history/explanations.How-on-earth could the rails track have stayed still for 18 years without any maintenance ? Or even if they could by some miracle, given in the volatile context of post-apocalypse, it would've been another big miracle that there had been no earthquake or some little landslide anywhere on the railway.Why the perpetual engine needs children to keep running ? Also I think no one's understood what the child had been doing down there in the engine core.The motivation of Wilford could've been developed more. He is someone who wants to play God on the humanity. In fact, it was what he'd done in the (his) train. Yet, the last scenes didn't get any close to deliver it.All of those plot holes and those script points under-developed that'd kept me from fully enjoying the movie.Before jumping to a conclusion, I have to admit that when it comes to rate movies with a ""serious"" theme or ""great"" core idea, I've always tended to be much more difficult than when I rate some ""full-entertainment-fast-food"" (like Marvel). Indeed, I gave it 7/10 at first, but then I felt so hard for all the great moments this movie has brought to us, that's why my final rate 8/10.",Snowpiercer

I wouldn't even bother to list the things wrong with the story because just about everything is illogical.

514,MomoFuzz,"Creative stuff, but missing the polish",6,21 February 2020,"What a weird movie. Snowpiercer sits right on the line between a gritty, oppressive dystopia and a cartoonishly absurd action adventure. It's dressed like a sci-fi, but doesn't even pretend to have any kind of pseudo scientific logic to its setting. The Wilford Train and the insane society in it doesn't care for any ""suspension of disbelief"" nonsense. It's all a spectacle. That sounds terrible, but I actually kind of enjoyed that aspect. It had such fun set design, cinematography, and costumes that I was drawn in despite its flaws.This could've been a great blend of surrealism and science fiction in cinema. But for me it failed mostly in the writing and characters. The dialogue was pretty subpar. It didn't have any nuance, but it wasn't realistic either. A lot of exposition dumping and soap box ranting. The characters were all just plot devices at best and never felt like real people. While I was OK with the rest of the movie being weird and illogical, I couldn't connect with such artificial characters. Even the movie's social message lost its acuity because I couldn't get invested in the people it was being communicated through.It might have been better if it was made entirely in Korean. The Korean characters had more natural dialogue in my opinion (I speak it). Seeing what Bong Joon Ho could do with Parasite, I feel like he can convey more nuanced ideas if left to work on his own.",Snowpiercer

The plot. A lot of things were not making sense, this whole idea of a dustpan future wasn't thought out well enough. It was so brutal graphic and barbaric at times when it didn't really need to be. My favorite part was he was starting to go into detail (completely unnecessary to the plot btw) how they are people. Not just people but especially babies, because they tasted best. Not much later he gets INSANELY mad at someone for making children do work in bad conditions, while he himself used to eat children. The movie ends in a way that means I guess, that humanity will go inside after all. Not that I'm sorry about it, they were all crazy.

There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies in this film that it would take too long to list and other reviewers have already done a decent job of listing them.
However, my main objection is about the train. This train is verrrrry long - it has about 30 carriages and is rattling along at great speed. It goes around the world once every year. If it travelled it's shortest route, it would travel the circumference of the earth, 25,000 miles. The speed required to travel this distance in one year would be 2.85 miles per hour. Even if it didn't travel in a direct route and it had to zigzag its way around the earth and travelled 50,000 miles, it would only have to travel at 5.7 miles per hour!

522,sgtGiggsy,"If you expect a good movie, you'll be disappointed",3,1 October 2014,"Snowpiercer starts out well to later become a huge pile of crap. I know it sounds harsh, but that's exactly the truth. Of course, I see that it's an allegory. That's absolutely clear from about 40 mins into the movie. After a while they don't even try to hide it, because they literally explain you the whole point of the movie. And even without that it's an allegory, that's not even hard to decode. Our society is bad, the rich and powerful live good and suck the blood of the poor they keep in the mud, while the middle class don't do anything against it. Etc, etc. As the events of the movie go by, you realize: ""yeah, that meant that, this means this"" and while this shouldn't be a problem, sadly it is. Why? Because the movie doesn't make any sense by on its own. I believe that if an artwork (movie, book, painting, sculpture, etc) works only as an allegory, and other than that it can't work by on its own, then it worth nothing. If we took out the allegory of Snowpiercer, the only thing left, is a movie with full of plot holes, two-dimensional characters, ridiculously written dialogs and absolutely illogical behavior from everybody (and with this I don't even criticize the surreal events, I criticize that the people don't act like anybody would in their situation). All of this, because they tried so hard to give EVERYTHING a second meaning, they forgot to give sense of their first meaning.I'm sure there will be some people, who'll overlook all the flaws of Snowpicer, because they'll feel the deeper meaning over-shines these. It's good for them, but if you are not like that, avoid this movie at all costs.",Snowpiercer

All I thought was ""might be another action sci-fi flick"" but trust me there are many angles to look at this movie. The director's vision was something very extraordinary, he blended many flavors with great conviction. Every detail and line spoken has some importance in the story and every scene has something you have to remember so that you can flash as the story goes along, not even one reel of film wasted I suppose.I don't want to narrate the story here, but the movie portrays a little bit of humanity and how humans react in different situations. This is not a drama or an action or a thriller and definitely not a comedy, I am not able to judge want genre this belongs tomay be an action mixed dramanot sure :-)Watch the movie with an open mind, I am pretty sure you will like it.I enjoyed it, great direction !!",Snowpiercer

Great photography, completely barmy action scenes, and a general feeling that the writers and director must have been on drugs when they made the film, combine to make this effort enjoyable. You just have to approach the film in the way you would to any comic book style film. If you are looking for logic and verisimilitude, forget it.

Sure, if by that you mean a sub-standard high school student read the ""coles notes"" of those 2 books then composed this plot the night before it was due as their entry for a short story for remedial English class. First of all, the concepts and plot of this film are so completely absurd that you have to assume that it is intended in such a way and that the train is really a metaphor intended to make some sort of trite social commentary. Whatever it is, it does it poorly. The social imagery is all poor attempts to restate what others have said better...often the metaphor seems poorly thought out, and well just doesn't work...at all. For example, it doesn't even work as a statement of how the 1% oppress the majority...since the people at the rear of the train don't even seem to do anything other than eat and sleep, so more like they are on welfare than slaves. I could go on, but I have already giving this film too much thought, I just want to forget it now.Production values are OK, since it doesn't look like it was filmed with a 1985 handicam, but I can't think of much else to say in a positive sense.I was in agony watching this film to completion, even with a complete suspension of logic.

It is an action film at the end of the day and expensive CGI is ultimately now a major focus of the genre. To the director's credit though he tries, in part successfully, to detract from itIn summary:1. Tilda Swinton steals the show but I'm sure she was impersonating Maxine Peake (Silks, The Village) 2. John Hurt played his limited part well.3. Main hero, Chris Evans always sounded like a USA dubbed voice from a Manga film.4. Fight scenes gorgeously vicious5. The fish? Surreal. Bit like a Terry Gillian film6. I dare anyone to deny that the axemen in the first major fight scene did not remind them of Gru's Minions in Despicable Me.7. The fight scene in the sauna carriage is truly horrific in its bluntness.This film won't be a big box office hit but will quickly become a cult classic. I did enjoy it but it seemed to lose focus about 2/3 of the way through and never really pulled itself back to the pace set at the outset.

To show the good guys they mean business, a large fish is brought to the front and it is promptly gutted, which lets them (and us) know, hey, those hatchets are sharp!

531,watchthisspacefilmmagazi,Brutal action at its best,7,14 December 2014,"So I've been looking at this for a while now, debating whether or not to spend two hours of my time on something that looked like a slightly different take of Elysium (2013), but I recently took the plunge and watched Snowpiercer (2013).The film follows the premise that the world grew too warm due to global warming. The answer to this was a drastic climate control experiment which was aimed at cooling the world. It did this, but a little too much and entered the world into a very sudden ice age. The only survivors of all of humanity now reside on a train, a modern Noah's Ark. The train is ripe with inequality and injustice with the class war being the main focus. The poor people want to get to first class and take over the train.I was hesitant to watch this because, as I mentioned before, the premise sounded rather similar to Elysium. Yes there were similarities but where Elysium dealt more with the superficial issues surrounding class war mixing in some impressive CGI, Snowpiercer got down to the gritty realism of such a divide. Showing us that what separates the two classes is something as small as the ticket they bought when boarding the train. It showed us the self-righteousness of the upper-class and the extent they went to in order to preserve their paradise and the disgusting things they were willing to do.We see the lead character Curtis (Chris Evans) become the leader of the tail end of the train and orchestrate a rebellion. It's refreshing to see Chris in a role which doesn't require him to take his top off, much to the distress of female audiences I'm sure. He still plays a character who knows how to kick ass but there is more to him than that. He has a story we care about, dropping little clues throughout the film which all tie together nicely later on. He was a character I liked, I rooted for him, even after some truths come out.The supporting roles were filled nicely, none more so than by John Hurt, Jamie Bell and Octavia Spencer, all giving some great performances that we have come to expect from these three.One of the things I absolutely loved about this film, and one of the areas in which it differs to Elysium, was the action scenes. It was primarily hand-to-hand combat as the underclass makes their way through the train. I'm talking axes, daggers, spears and of course the good old fashioned fist. But what makes it go from good to great is the direction of these scenes, it was outstanding. The camera angles made you feel like you were there, then the next minute take you right back out of the action, looking in, horrifying you with the fighting before you.This was a film that takes place in the future where everyone has regressed to the past. The pure savagery of the film, the hate that slowly builds in you towards the upper-class and the way that can turn within seconds is something I haven't seen in a while. Some fight scenes were reminiscent of Oldboy (2003) with the sheer violence mixed with the compact nature of the environment giving both side the savagery that comes when you have nowhere to go apart from forward.So if you, like me, have been pondering over whether to spend two hours watching something that, on the surface, sounds unoriginal then I implore you to give it a go. The two hours fly by and you will not be disappointed.",Snowpiercer

Boo hoo- then he gets his 'hero moment' 5 mins later saving Timmy and his arm gets cut off. His dream sacrifice! It just all seemed to set up yet too random at the same time.

For years it just laid there, but when I finally decided to give it a go it opened a whole new world for me. It was mindblowing and mad, and the same could be said for most of the korean cinematography. In 2013,2014 madness of Korean directors finally started making their way to Hollywood, so we got Park's Stoker, Jee-woon Kim's The Last Stand and Joon-ho Bong's Snowpiercer.Even though Bong is my least favorite director out of 3, this is easily the best movie. Ridiculous concept screams Korea, but is actually based on a french graphic novel. And although you expect all chaos and mayhem the movie often surprises with a change of pace and some real poignant dialogues. Casting is spot on, though it must be said - Tilda Swinton steals the show.
Then there's the sets. This movie wouldn't work without believable locations and making you believe this whole movie is taking place inside of a train and this was handled perfectly.

Because the train with a clear Malthusian ceiling doesn't take a simple neo-Malthusian precaution/solution: birth control! No birth control; it seems Wilford rather wants to breed some ""inferior"" (Untermensch) children, for cleaning the engine of his Ark-like train. Did I just say ""Ark-like""?

Its ability to create transcendent images mirroring humanity's most intrinsic myths lends it an elemental, mythic quality, like some sort of legend told around tribal bonfires.In its final images, it gives resonant images of rebirth by fire; it assures us that, as humanity always does, we will start again, rising from the ashes like the Phoenix of old.Thank you for your time.",Snowpiercer

It just sucks... :-( Why? It is just FULL OF PLOT HOLES!!!!!!! Like how could they operate a friggin' train continually for several years without maintaining the tracks in freezing sub- zero temperatures? Why do not just build a base instead somewhere (maybe underground)? If this would be a self-maintaining spaceship (like the ones in ""Star Trek""), I would say OK, it is maybe possible: they just keep flying in space, and that is it. Or even a ship like the ones in ""Waterworld"". But a train??? Even with the ""perpetual machine"", it would just derail at some point, and everybody would just die, as the tracks would break due to being old, frozen and such. Also, this ""planned riot"" thing, and feeding children to the machine... Why would they do it this way? Why do not they just limit the population (condoms, sterilization, anti-baby pills), and feed animals or plants to the machine? Although in the ""Matrix"" movie they had a bit similar energy system (people lived in small cells and they supposedly gave energy to the Matrix), but it was way more believable. Like they gave their mental capacity to the system, or something like that. But small children running a train engine??? I do not know, it is just surreal somehow...As for the social criticism part, it is interesting, but this whole setting... I can compare it only to another allegoric movie ""El topo(1970)"", which is also illogical and highly overrated I think. The characters do not react realistically almost in any scene. Like there are the ""rich"", elite people who can just enjoy their lives, but they do not look shocked or astonished at all when they see the poor scum armed with guns, axes and such.And the main hero just destroys the whole train at the end.

543,MichaelM259,"If the ""us versus them"" trope is a tired and redundant one for some viewers, the action and excitement of Snowpiercer should still make it worth the price of admission.",6,14 July 2014,"Released overseas in 2013 to widespread critical and box office success, the long-anticipated Snowpiercer has finally hit U.S. theaters, and it did not disappoint. Joon-ho Bong's English-language debut is a uniquely thrilling and allegorical film that is sure to delight action lovers and sci-fi buffs alike. Bong's carefully balanced close-quarters combat sequences and ponderances on the capacity for human civility (and lack thereof) in the terrifying dystopian future illustrated by the film's source material—the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige—work in harmony to create a provocative story that demands the viewer's attention from beginning to end. The film opens in 2014 with a failed attempt by the governments of the world's most powerful countries to mitigate the effects of global warming by releasing an experimental substance called CW7 into the atmosphere. And as experimental substances are apt to do, CW7 has severe unintentional effects, chief among them reducing global temperatures to uninhabitable levels and killing all life on Earth. The few survivors of the disaster were those that were fortunate enough to board the Snowpiercer, a technologically-advanced train designed by the mysterious transportation tycoon, Wilford, to circumnavigate the planet once every year via a perpetual motion engine and withstand the harshest conditions imaginable. The story jumps ahead 17 years where an oppressive caste system has emerged aboard the Snowpiercer in which society's elites inhabit the front of the train with everyone else relegated to the back where life is nasty, brutish and short, to say the least. We quickly learn that a faction of the oppressed led by a reluctant hero named Curtis (played by Chris Evans of recent Captain America mega-success) is planning an uprising in order to seize control of the engine car at the helm of the seemingly never ending train. Assisted by his compatriots Edgar (Jamie Bell) and Tanya (Octavia Spencer), Curtis and his revolutionaries break out of their holding car and begin their march towards the front. Following a series of creatively shot and violent battle sequences as well as some welcome respites of comedy from security specialist Namgoong Minsoo and his daughter Yona (played by Bong regulars Kang-ho Song and Ah-sung Ko, respectively), a battered and bloodied Curtis finally reaches Wilford's train car, setting up an unexpected and plot-pivoting confrontation.What is clearly evident after watching Snowpiercer is that Bong has an uncanny mastery over story and cadence. Not only does the film successfully keep its audience focused on what the characters are doing (which is more than one can say about most recent blockbusters), the storyline at times develops at a feverish pace, careening like a crazy-train towards some resolution that the viewer doesn't even have the time to anticipate. To be sure, a portion of this fervor can be attributed to the plot device of the train, where Curtis & Co's systematic movement from car to car—and foe to foe—naturally keeps the audience focused on the here and now, left only to wonder what awaits them in the next car and at the end of the line. However, that Bong is able to make his audience care about what happens to his characters despite the speed and chaotic nature with which the plot develops is truly impressive in its own right. Speaking of chaos: the action in this movie is gripping and full of impact. While the close-proximity camera and small sets should be enough to create a sense of claustrophobia for the viewer, Kyung-pyo Hong's cinematography coupled with attentive film and sound editing transform the train into a veritable hot box of kinetic energy and gore. In one particularly bloody train car brawl, the audience feels as if it is right there, ducking and dodging scores of battle axes alongside Evans' grizzled Curtis. Though that's not to say the world of Snowpiercer lacks depth. Sprawling, desolate landscapes of abandoned cities and capsized freightliners caked in ice stand in stark contrast to the mayhem indoors; the outer world would almost have a peacefulness about it if it weren't so eerily presented. While many apocalypse and disaster movies are catalyzed by events that humanity largely cannot control (aliens, pandemics, zombies, etc.), it seems an increasing volume of cinema output concerns itself with mankind's self-inflicted rapture (Bong's 2006 monster thriller The Host, for one). A bevy of films have warned us against the follies of ignoring climate change, and although Snowpiercer's story begins with this idea, it is not the central conflict with which Bong is concerned. More interesting to the filmmakers is what happens to society after the stable walls of civilization have crumbled and the pre-existing dividing lines of social class are replaced by something else (a train, for instance). Pessimistically, the film's view of the world is one of power and control. With resources scarcer than ever and the entire world confined to just a few compartments of haves and have-nots, the train steps in as a surrogate habitat for mankind to continue business as usual in a microcosm of its former self. Those in power use familiar discourse of ""preordination"" and ""knowing one's place"" to force-feed the current state of things to the masses. One authoritarian monologue harbors religious undertones, with the speaker rationalizing that the social hierarchy was decided this way ""in the beginning"" and should not be altered. The question of whether this is a type of world worth being apart of—for both those at the bottom and the top of the social ladder—is what Curtis is eventually tasked with deciding for everyone on board. If the ""us versus them"" trope is a tired and redundant one for some viewers, the action and excitement of Snowpiercer should still make it worth the price of admission. Evans turns in a solid performance, but it is Tilda Swinton's energetic and often hilarious Minister Mason that shines above the rest. For some, this will be their favorite film of 2014. For others, just another summer action flick.",Snowpiercer

550,tonicboy,A film which pushes suspension of disbelief past reason,3,8 July 2014,"This review contains *mild* spoilers.As a fan of sci-fi films, I am no stranger to the concept of suspension of disbelief. The sci-fi genre requires it by its nature. And yet, a movie can viewers to suspend their disbelief to an unreasonable extent. Without a doubt, this movie has surpassed that threshold more than any other movie I have ever watched.First, the premise of the movie is absurd. In the future, a chemical to reverse global warming has backfired and brought on an ice age. The only survivors are the passengers of a super-train which is a completely self-contained ecosystem and which has been running non-stop for 18 years.OK, let's just stop right there. Why anyone would or could build a train which is a self-contained ecosystem is just silly. The idea that it could run for 18 years with no refueling is even sillier.Second, the tail section of the train is filled with the poor who are oppressed by the rich elite of the train. In a closed system with limited resources, it makes no sense to keep the poor people around at all. The end of the movie makes an argument for why they keep the poor people, but the argument itself is even more ludicrous and unbelievable.Third, a handful of rebels fight their way towards the front of the train. A train is one giant tunnel. It is quite possibly the easiest terrain in the world to defend. You simply place a few defenders at a choke point such as the door between train cars, and they can defend against a much larger force. This is the lesson we learned in 300 :) And yet somehow, this ragtag group of malnourished rebels manages to fight their way through heavily armed defenders.Beyond that, there are a myriad of specific details which make no sense. One train car is a giant aquarium with a glass tunnel through it complete with sharks and manta rays. In a ~10ft wide train car. In another scene, the train turns a corner and two characters have a gunfight across opposing train cars. The two cars remain stationary relative to each other for the entire 5 minute gunfight. In one of the final scenes, an angry mob chases down two of the main characters and corners them, then just stands around waving their arms at these two unarmed people for about 10 minutes.I really wanted to like this movie but I never had more than a few minutes to watch the movie before another ridiculous plot point came up.",Snowpiercer

It's a superb sci-fi social allegory and probably the best in the genre since district 9. Just brilliant.Mind that Bong's tone and sometimes twisted sense of humor may be too much for the average western viewer (and indeed worked better in his previous Korean films). So, I'd not recommend this film to everyone - but if you're a film lover, Snowpiercer is just right for you.",Snowpiercer

560,AverageStalker,"Intense, Epic, Questions the nature of man",9,9 July 2014,"This film is wonderful. While I do agree that there are questions left unanswered about how it is possible to have a train circumnavigate the glove forever (like where the funding would come from, how certain materials would be obtained in a post-apocalyptic world, etc.), all movies have this flaw. I feel like they did a pretty good job of answering many science-based questions and filling simple plot holes- like what they are eating, how the ""economy"" works, etc. Of course, issues with scientific explanations will always exist in a work of science fiction and therefore they exist in this film as well. Putting those aside, this film is nearly a masterpiece.The ""curtis revolution"" lets us see how a man thirsty for vengeance can be manipulated to become the next tyrant, how people can be exploited for their emotions, the lows to which humanity can stoop in times of desperation, and so on. Not only does the movie dare to question the deepest of human morality, but it is also an awesome, action-packed ride. The fight sequences and plot twists along the way are riveting and exciting, and I couldn't help but find myself cheering for the ""good guys"".The only negatives are, like I said, a few scientific plot holes, questions left about what exactly the purpose of the child engine operator is, and some other questions about the size of the train and how it works. The idea that tracks could remain in functioning condition for 18 years in a frozen wasteland is also rather insane, but for how good this movie is I'm willing to suspend my disbelief.The acting is excellent.

But to say this is some sort of masterpiece. The characters are over the top bad. The story is bad and full of plot holes. The train it self, makes no sense. Not even wealthy people would have gotten the idea of all the different cars for food and spa, but no beds. Not to mention every other single horrible bad detail. Even the stowaways. Why not just kill them if they take up to much space. Nothing seem to stop them from dismembering, so why not just kill all of them.

Perhaps because Chris Evans was in it some of the aforesaid ""it was crap"" reviewers expected a different film altogether.
I need to watch it again as there are many levels of mystery to be uncovered. I think what people think are 'plot holes' are the director making points that are not immediately obvious but which reveal themselves - even while you sit and ponder on what you just watched.

This is because a chemical weapon has destroyed all other life on Earth, and the last humans to survive were those rich or lucky enough to hitch a ride. Those who did not pay to get on have to fight for survival, while those rich enough to get on live and prosper in the front section. The film follows a revolution led by those impoverished in the back section, and trails them as progress to the front to meet the deity-like creator of the train and confront him.

569,applogonjinish,Dystopian depiction of Climate Change,7,2 January 2020,"This film in the beginning bored me a bit for about 20 minutes but then I realised that it was actually depicting a dystopia in the post climate change era. The depiction itself is cool even with bad cinematography. It is rather theatrical when it comes to cinematography and not pertaining to films of modern Hollywood. They could have shown the outside of the train more vividly than using a video games like graphics. For me it muddled the whole idea of the futuristic train set in 2031. I must say graphics is pretty bad. So bad, that it feels like video games screen !!The train's driving force seems to be perpetual motion machine which is according to today's physics, a mathematical impossibility. So the director should have researched his physics knowledge properly before depicting such a thing. The futuristic train could have been powered by many other sources of energy which are feasible with physics. When one goes beyond the boundary of physics, it belongs to the category of fantasy fiction. But this film is not a fantasy fiction. It's a physically possible dystopia.The film describes the economy of a closed ecological system like earth itself, which is nice. It also shows how the class system evolves in our society and that it remains the same in whatever world scenario we belong to. Humans will fall prey to these things
Social Economics
Greed for power
Greed to control everything
Run behind an illusory la dolce vita
Hunger for sex
These are the driving forces of our world today and will remain so.A VERY VERY important aspect of this film is the last scene which shows a polar bear moving around in nature when the whole world is covered is going through an ice age. This symbolises the fact that humans with all their wit and intellect have developed a very complex society but have not been able to tackle nature. On the other hand, those who have been with nature (the polar bear) need no special and closed ecological system to survive.

I certainly thought about it a decent amount after, but mostly in terms of ""Why would anyone pursue this concept?THE GOOD
Evans is pretty likable as Curtis and it's pretty sad when his best friend dies. The idea of the bug paste food is appropriately gross and finding the little bullets in it is kinda cool but definitely not close to original. Song and Asung as father and daughter add an interesting element. The settings for some of the cars create nice atmospheres.THE BAD
The whole idea is completely flawed, you may say ""suspend your disbelief and enjoy it"" but the entire point of a science fiction story is that it could be conceivable in some reality if the technology were there. You can just poof that away but it's always gonna make the story less believable even if just subconsciously.There's not even an attempt at explaining how the train just keeps running, so they forfeit any chance to salvage that and it ruins the whole thing, at least for me. The kids working on it to maintain it does not explain it away.But ok, let's say it works. It's still a horribly limiting idea. I guess it does make you feel isolated on the train like they are, but it kind of feels like the amount of actual content and ideas in it would make a good short film, not a full length.All I saw was basically a stew of sci-fi tropes, mixed with classist themes (delivered in the least subtle way possible). The ending is maybe the worst part of the movie, it's both a cop out and just terribly conceived of.The acting is mostly okay, but there's no room in this script for any sort of give, it suffocates the actors with its lack of awareness and lack of quality.Overall I don't get the hype, actually I'll say it I hate this movie, but i respect your opinion if you like it.

Society is divided between the first class minority, with their fine tailors and cocktail parties, and the downtrodden masses, with little more than the rags on their backs they can call their own. Of course, revolution is in order, but the plan for regicide will require a trip down the length of the train, with a few bloody battles and the discovery of what life is really like ""on the other side"" filling in the remainder of the story.Class struggle is naturally the topic of so many sci-fi films, from classics like ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"" to contemporary derivatives such as ""District 9"" and ""Elysium."" So taking up such a topic is a little like opening a hamburger joint -- you really have to do it well, and ideally provide your own twist, to have any hope of impressing your clients.Unfortunately ""Snowpiercer"" follows the tried-and-true formulas a little too closely to inspire, and it's hard not to feel like we've been served a Big Mac of a film. There are caricatures, not characters: the hero who doubts himself, the naive sidekick who worships his idol, the wise octogenarian guiding the flock. There are even a couple of video-game references thrown in for the kids in the forms of a martial arts expert and the ""boss"" who comes back from the dead. We share in the characters' wonder about the extravagant lives of passengers in the front cars, but little else drives the plot. The script reads like something written by a non-native speaker, quite honestly, and, as with other films that aspire to the demands of an international box office, the writers settle for brevity, simplicity, and imitation where tactfulness and originality were called for.I didn't see Chris Evans in ""Captain America,"" but I imagine that your appraisal of his acting in that movie might go a long way in determining whether you like his role in this one. In my mind, Evans does little more in ""Snowpiercer"" than dutifully recite his lines and chop down some bad guys, but judging from box office returns these days, that's not necessarily a bad thing.For those who want to step outside the boundaries of Hollywood, I heartily recommend you skip this film in favor of Bong's earlier Korean works, especially ""Barking Dogs Never Bite,"" ""Memories of Murder,"" and ""Mother."" Those films are wonderfully crafted windows onto Korean society that touch upon real divides between class and generation instead of the roughly hewn metaphors we endure in ""Snowpiercer.""",Snowpiercer
575,Flunky3k,A Distopian Miracle,8,18 July 2014,"Firstly, I cannot believe this movie was allowed to be made. A US science fiction action film with Korean main characters and dialog with a French art house film for a Seoul. This film is more La Jetée than Captain America or Elysium. After mankind's seemingly ultimate ecological catastrophuck plunges the world in to an ice age trying to combat global warming, the last remnants of humanity are left on metaphoric train which is a microcosm of the history of civilization and societal flaws.Each car moving from the beginning of society (end of the train) is a step thru its development. From the caves, to barbarism, feudalism, enlightenment, engineering, medicine, hedonism, and ultimately hubris. Civilization is running on rails, all aboard trapped physically and mentally. Plowing thru the perceived barriers even as its is surrounded by its own wasteland going nowhere. If we just stick to the plan, and accept the exploitation and sacrifices to humanity, the greater good will be obtained. The order is eternal and necessary the leader says. Is there a hope that a peasants revolt, a socialistic overthrow of the order will bring hope and equality? Well, no. The revolt brings on an avalanche knocking the train and civilization of the track and destruction of what little remained. We are left with the bleak prospect of a return Adam and Eve. At least she might be in charge this time. But ultimately nature goes on. Even the endangered polar bear out survived our folly. And we are left with realization there is nothing eternal, fair, or bright about civilizations prospects. The train was always going to go off the cliff. At least that's my rough take.",Snowpiercer
576,ryanthecooper,Poor execution of a great idea,2,15 June 2020,"Full disclosure: I only heard about this movie because I stumbled upon the Netflix series version and saw in the credits it was based on a movie, so I made an effort to get hold of a copy and give it a go.
It's practically impossible to not compare the two, and I will be doing so. This may have given me a preconceived idea on how the movie would be, but knowing this I did my best to try and watch it from a frame of seeing this concept for the first time and trying to let it hold it's own.
It didn't work.Before I get into that, here's what I liked.
The cast. Chris Evans, John Hurt, Ed Harris and Tilda Swinton are some pretty big names, the latter three in particular. Just having the likes of them onboard made me go into this movie with a fair amount of optimism and their characters offered a bit of buoyancy to this sinking ship. Or train.
The train. The Netflix train comes across as twice the height and width of the movie version, and while it does offer some better explanations of their food supply, it doesn't feel as ""trainy"" as the movie train. Long shots down the carts showing the alignment shifts between carriages and the tighter shots of the trains interior showing the curved ceilings give you both a sense of movement and claustrophobia. The Netflix train is more like a bunch of ocean liners running on tracks.Now for what I didn't like.
The pacing. Somehow after only the first episode of the TV series, you know more about each section's culture, people and class differences than you do in the entire movie. It's achingly slow, despite it being an action movie with lots of shooting, punching, kicking, chopping, stabbing, etc. By the time the rebels from the tail eventually make it to the front of the train, you're just numb from the drawn-out attempts are creating tension before a fight, the fight itself and then the aftermath. Time froze (yes, I did that) while watching this.
Directing. This felt like a bad fan fiction to Paul Verhoven's and Quentin Tarrantino's directing styles. Starship Troopers meets Kill Bill, but if you ordered it from Wish. Epic stunt sequences come across as circus-like. Intensely hardcore tough guys come across as parodies. Deeply profound character expositions come across as running the clock and mind-blowing plot reveals come across as tiresome and obvious.As I type this, only three episodes of the series are available to watch, with the fourth due for release very soon. I feel much more of a connection to the characters and have a better understanding of the train, it's culture, the cult of Wilford and the hardships endured in the tail than the movie could ever have hoped to convey.
As far as I'm concerned, for actors of the caliber of Harris, Swinton, Hurt and Evans, this was their Green Lantern.",Snowpiercer
577,chrismrrw,As Good As 1984?! Don't Be Silly!,4,20 July 2014,"Everyone seems to be concentrating on the sort of factual 'errors' which movies, in my opinion, should be allowed to get away with from time to time. After all, although this movie attempts to be an analogy or even reflection of how the 'real world' works, I still don't mind giving directors a bit of room to stray from the prosaic in order to get their point across or to make things more exciting.My main beef with this movie is that it was so flat. Some reviewers have mentioned it in the same breath as 1984 and Animal Farm. I think to do that is to really, really not understand the genius of either of those books/films.In 1984 the population was very cleverly and completely manipulated into thinking that things such as their cause and big brother were truthful and fundamentally good. Simlar things happened in Animal Farm where the pigs overthrew their human masters under the guise of democracy, then set about manipulating almost all of the 'rules' in favour of the elite whilst still making the proletariat believe it was normal and for the greater good.Snowpiercer is nowhere near as clever as that. There is a fairly strict hierarchy, the proletariat are told that they're basically scum and that they should just accept it. Then there's the 'bully boys' to keep them in check (for what reward I've no idea), some sort of middle class who seem quite pointless and decadent, and a guy (or quasi-demi-god) at the top of the pile).Treat it as a bit of entertainment. Don't think for a second that it will stand the test of time of the fantastic satires of 1984 and Animal Farm - they're on an adult level, Snowpiercer is, at best, a satire-lite.",Snowpiercer
578,whuntva,Really Good,10,9 July 2014,"I heard so much hype going into this. I expected it to bomb horribly. This year, there are a few duds as usual, but most movies struck me as just okay. There was only one film I REALLY liked. (It was The LEGO Movie, oddly enough). But this may just be one of the most captivating and visually interesting experiences of this year. Dystopia has been beaten into the ground as of late, but Snowpiercer combines dystopian fiction with a scarily likely premise and stunning cinematography. This has probably one of the best action sequences in recent memory. It's Eastern film-making and art style combined with Western ideologies and formulas in away where neither are recognizable. If you're tired of hearing how great this movie is, try seeing it for yourself. You may not like it, but it is a unique experience and one of the most inventive and visually impressive films of this year.",Snowpiercer
579,jovanroland,An amazing masterpiece!,10,13 July 2014,"If you're a fan of pure, logical and sensible action, leave now. Not to say that this movie isn't filled to the brim with amazing and exciting action sequences, but the action itself is not in the center of this movie. This movie, it's atmosphere, the plot, themes, metaphors - everything... Is just pure art.To keep it short, the whole movie was a huge allegory of life, the society and the system that humanity has lived in since the dawn of time. The movie drives you to think about philosophy and metaphysics, and question every aspect of your life.To those that don't like stuff like this, the movie is still exciting and full of action, but this movie just isn't meant to be watched as a view-it-once-and-shelf-it action flick. The whole point of the movie is in it's deep and metaphorical plot.All in all, don't skip this one! Give it a try, I liked it, you might, too.",Snowpiercer
580,WatchingInDarkness,"The execution of the film is solid, if the story has glaring misses",8,27 June 2021,"If you haven't seen it, do. It's worth watching several times.The atmosphere is a bit of a cross between Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome and Aliens and maybe Brazil. It thrives on the surreal.As a metaphor of the social inequity of human civilization, it pulls no punches, and by the end, all all punished, but protagonist and villain alike.Swinton and Evans carry the show, as to be expected, but the entire cast is laudable for grit, mostly.The one thing that challenges the willing suspension of disbelief is the setting of the plot in the near future, driving a necessity of disbelief at so many elements. The train is just a train with a super engine, but not even a futuristic maglev or anything like that. Multiple scenes show it rolling along on conventional wheels, supposedly in perpetual motion for 17 years. It's pure Disney. Train tracks deteriorate all on their own and shift and without a world of ice making it even worse. It's literally impossible to keep a train on the tracks year after year without maintenance of the tracks.Another gap you could drive a train through is the inexplicable supply of insects for the protein bars. The teacher opens fire in a boxcar full of the very children that are the future of mankind, just to kill an enemy, not likely or plausible, a bit forced.There are more, but you get the idea. It's not just the OCD viewer who would catch these obvious impossibilities. The author and director want the viewer to think deeper, but then block the way with facts.Don't let it keep you from watching though. It just requires more acceptance of artistic license than normal.",Snowpiercer

Then, the revolution to fight to the front(as the tag-line says it), has been useless? I can't figure it out, i mean...The more you actually think about it, the weirder it gets, since the entire revolution itself leads to...the end of humanity? Is that it? Yona and Tim survive, but there is no food, no water, and even if the situation is getting better, they won't find anything to live long enough to actually survive! But yes, still, 9 out of 10. Because this movie is the intensity itself, and the whole ""masterpiece"" thing about Snowpiercer is true: this movie is even sick! Like, really really sick! The best scene is at, around, 40 minutes. There are no words. It's totally...The technical of shooting the film are very very good, even surprising.The music by Marco Beltrami too is sick, and fits with the concerned scenes so perfectly, you just watch some scenes again and again. just watch it, the social disparities are shown, to a better point than in Elyium(which is a compliment), or just than ever.

583,Darkdemonqueen,Wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be,4,20 August 2014,I love action/sci-fi/post apocalyptic movies and I was very disappointed by this movie because it was not as good as I thought it was going to be. The storyline is okay. The director took a different approach with the action sequences and I didn't like it and it just didn't translate well to me .....the viewer. I understand cinematography wise what he was trying to do but the shots were off and the point of view was strange. The lead actor Chris Evans is awesome though so if you like him that's a good reason to go see it.And I will say something in the defense of this movie I had just got just got done seeing The Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise because it was a double feature day in my favorite theater and the edge tomorrow was so good compared to the snow piercer it's probably not fair to snow piercer I just saw a movie like to be at you tomorrow before it so that's probably one of the reasons why I didn't like the snow piercer as much as I probably would have normally.

This is exactly what makes the movie great and in my opinion different than other films. At some points the film has more style than substance, but it also serves you a surrealistic undertone instead. I can understand why people don't like Snowpiercer. The ending was a bit weak, mainly because our protagonist and antagonist don't come to a revelation, there is no real showdown, no disclosure, the train blows up and we never know what would have happened. I think this is why people don't find a conclusion and therefore give the film so much hate. But it had good characters, nice visual work and the creativity spoke for itself. It was entertaining, and it does not require realism for it, so I give it a solid 7.",Snowpiercer
585,Breh22,Breath of Fresh Air,10,17 February 2015,"I couldn't tell you a movie that surprised me more than Snowpiercer. It is a masterpiece that grabs you by every emotion and sensation. I went into this movie on a lonely and boring night surfing Netflix for a good watch. The setting was interesting and different so I decided to give it a go. I was expecting a movie 1/4 as good as Snowpiercer and I truly mean that. This film is just a breath of fresh air that can never be forgotten. It ha been months since I have seen this movie but whenever my mind turns to movie I seem to think about Snowpiercer. It hit me that hard, the last movie to do that to me was ""There Will Be Blood"". The setting, cast, suspense, excitement, and curiosity thrives throughout this entire movie start to finish. This film throws a lot at you in a short amount of time. Everything was engaging from start to finish because of that. I was constantly wondering what was in the next car of the train. Enough with my rambling, this is a must see for anyone. In order to enjoy this movie you need to stop and enjoy, not critique and criticize every little thing.It is different and is a ride that wants you to enjoy it but you just need to let it in.

586,nulkparveen,An Allegory!,9,6 February 2015,"A film like this is an allegory. If you can't understand allegories or if you're the kind of person that needs, literally, every little thing spelt out for you, walk on by. You will get confused by this film and give it one star. However, if you can appreciate social commentary then your mind won't throw ridiculous questions at you like ""why divide the train into classes"" because your brain will let you appreciate the allegory with society. i.e.... why divide society into classes??? The planet would survive perfectly well without classes. Your brain will let you appreciate, in society, there will always be people who want more than everyone else. There will always be people who are happy to step on others so they can hoard wealth and material possessions. This film is a perfect allegory of that. Yes, there is enough for everyone but there isn't enough for everyone when there are people who want more than their fair share. Similarly, you will be able to appreciate that when you are treated like a savage, you become a savage so you won't ask dumb questions like ""why is everyone on this train so ready to kill."" You will see, that when you have nothing to live for, you have no reason to fear death and when you have nothing to live for, life becomes a lot less precious so you don't have massive reservations about killing someone. Moreover, you will be able to see, there are people in society today who run to join the military in the belief that protecting their way of life makes them the good guys and the poor oppressed people they are killing are savages so deserve to die. You will not need to ask these questions, because you will be able to see the allegory between this film and life. In addition to being able to appreciate this film is an allegory, you also have to watch the film. Pay attention to every line of dialogue because this is not a Michael Bay film, this director does not have massive arrows and signs and horns heralding the arrival of exposition. You have to be able to pick up on little lines like Wilford loved trains, his dream was to live on one forever. So you can appreciate that Wilford didn't build this train in response to the ice-age, he built this train because it was his dream and that coincided with the ice-age.You will also, if paying attention, listen to lines like ""the engine was designed to last forever, but, sadly, other parts of the train were not."" So you won't have to ask questions like ""this train was designed to stuff kids down holes."" You will have listened to the explanation and appreciate that no one designed this train with the foresight that there's going to be an apocalypse and this train will actually never be able to stop. It was built with ""hey let's see if we can do it"" ethos rather than a ""hey we need to do it, this is humanity's last chance"" ethos. You will also hear throwaway lines like ""this train is a ""self contained eco-system"" so you won't wonder where the meat is coming from for the steaks or where the cockroaches came from. You will know that just as this train had an arboretum and a marine containment system, that there must have been a carriage, somewhere, off camera that had similar setups for insects and livestock. Finally, in addition to paying attention to exposition and appreciating allegories, you will have to learn a film making concept of ""do you want a 15 hour film?"" This is a concept where you, the viewer, has to fill in the blanks. You, the viewer, has to be able to see that drugs are the opiate of the masses. You make drugs readily available so that people's minds never clear long enough to realise they're in the shitter. But, prolonged exposure to drugs is pretty much going turn your brain into a fried noodle so you're going to be strange. Even if you don't take drugs, you're on a train that never stops, that's a noodle bender in itself. Given all of this, people are going to be weird so you shouldn't need an exact explanation of what the motivation is behind their weirdness. So, in conclusion, if you want a film that makes you think in the right ways you will enjoy this. If you want a film that spells everything out for you and you can't suspend disbelief for a second the thing you're looking for is reality TV.",Snowpiercer

590,mgdu,Noisy garbage for the demented,2,1 December 2014,"Bombastic rot with very little living intelligence or sensibility, a tale seemingly razzled up by a pursy cyborg sociopath to lure an audience of coarse appetites and dim minds.The only redeeming feature in this long, long, turgid slog is the witty cameo pop-ups of Tilda Swinton, tossing a few bits of garlic and sapphire into the muck, like Baudelaire's sun glistening into the carrion putrefying along the roadside.But even Ms Swinton was painful to watch shilling from the stage of MoMA this evening, trying to pretend that this bloated carrion has any real value. Answering a question about its sources of ""inspiration""(sic!), Ms Swinton tolled ""bombast"" at least 3 times to derogate the kind of world leaders (Qaddafi, et al) that the film reflects, all the while blissfully ignoring that brutal bombast is exactly what comprises this film from snout to tail--including both the spasms of grotesque maiming and murdering wreaked on the characters, and the even worse mental torment wreaked on the minds of the audience (at least on the small sentient quotient, neurons dying as they watched). And for Ms S to laud this film as a deconstruction of social stratification, as if she had never seen films like Regles du Jeu, had eyes rolling out of sight. No doubt actresses get used to selling themselves inside and out. But can anyone question that Renoir, 70 years less informed, tackled class conflict w incomparably finer grace, intelligence, wit, and emotional power than this pompous turd? Tossed among the scenes of ugliness and mayhem, battles that unfold w/o rhyme or reason, are heavy musings about life and culpability by characters who are empty stereotypes , often PC, less interesting humanly than the scenery. It's always good to see the great John Hurt, but he is useless here; and Ed Harris is wrong for his part. Snowpiercer is a film worth avoiding. Even the fight scenes are pathetic, nothing but clichés badly handled, chaotic, arbitrary, unbelievable, distinguished only by some corny sadistic sights and sounds, all of which is especially revolting enveloped in the director's smarmy PC casting and storyline, which reeks of Bill Cosby. The film's only value is for a scathing anthropology of our culture demonstrating in its popularity the buzz of battalions of blow- flies drawn to carrion.",Snowpiercer

592,sharok,A Sorry Mess,3,24 June 2015,"Let me get one thing out of the way right now : this film is a logical mess. An ideological excuse for hamfisting one's way from beginning to end.Oh, there will be nothing but spoilers ahead. You are warned.First, about the train itself. This train rambles along like a freight train, but is supposed to go at high speed. The cars sway from side to side, but no motion is visible when inside the train. Almost like inside is filmed in an immobile studio set. Also, the train can smash through tons of ice without any problem. Must be made of unobtanium. And today's high speed trains have cars that sway a lot less than this one.The rails are a problem as well. It is so cold outside that one scene shows us the bodies of people who escaped from the train. They died barely a hundred yards away. That means temperatures at best in the range of Siberian winter, i.e. -70°C. At that temperature metal obviously freezes. Several thousand tons of freight dashing over it at high speed may work for a year or two, but at some point a rail WILL break, and that is the end for everyone. We are told that the train is magical all through the film. The entire rail system must be just as magical.Second, the train composition. In the best shot we have, at around 1:16:42, we get to see the whole train almost at once. I counted about 40 wagons. Throughout the film we see a few technical sections, a few sleeping quarters of varying quality, a dentist cabinet, a beauty parlor, a nightclub, a school, a library, a sushi bar with an aquarium, a deep freeze car to preserve meat and poultry. there is also a restaurant and a lounge. The head of the train is the engine section, which we more or less see. We are told there is a water car, but we see no water storage apart from the aquarium. We see dead poultry, but no live ones. Nor do we see cows. If you have livestock, you need a place to put them, and something that generates food for them. We are repeatedly told that the train is self-sustaining. Apart from that being impossible due to the laws of physics, there should be a recycling car somewhere. We don't see it. Neither do we see the bug car where all the bugs must be bred before being turned into the protein bars.The recycling issue is just as important as the water issue. Control either, and you control the whole. Control of the water is touched upon briefly, then ignored for the remainder of the film.Third, the population. We see the poor at the rear, the rich at the front. The poor have nothing to do but wait for food and not litter. They are dirty and wash once a year apparently, but there is no litter nor sickness to be seen. There is old and weak, but no germs that would thrive in such squalor and kill them all off within a month, let alone the 17 years they are supposed to have been locked up like that. No windows and nothing to do for 17 years ? They should all be screaming hysterically like raving lunatics, not having reasoned conversations.The rich are, of course, living luxuriously, but apart from eating, dancing and getting high, they aren't doing anything either. Their existence is just sitting in a train, watching the frozen landscape go by. Every single person on this train should be stark, raving mad.On the other hand, the pregnant schoolteacher doesn't hesitate to use a sub-machine gun and kill (poor) people in front of children, so maybe they actually are mad.Finally, we have The Plot, which is to elevate the hero to the position of Train Master, replacing the current one. The last 30 minutes of this ridiculous film is the revelation that all revolts on the train were piloted from both ends of the train to ensure that the balance of population stays within what the train can handle. We are specifically told that, should people be allowed to breed without restraint, the train's capacity would be overwhelmed and everyone would die.That argument is actually valid and understandable. Why the poor cannot benefit from the same living conditions as the rich is not. It may well be that bugs are a requirement for protein, but even if the train can only supply one cow a month, everyone can benefit from it. Share the bugs and share the cow, and for God's sake bathe regularly. Everything is supposed to be recycled, so there is no good reason only half the train population should be clean.At the end, the Hero takes the place of the current Train Master and is supposed to continue the same regime while said Master retires. Retires ? To do what exactly ? Apart from cooking his own food and plotting tortuous ways to get people killed, appears to already be in retirement from his job of creating the whole train/railway system - which must have been quite a task indeed.In this dystopian future, we are led to believe that a train that can never stop holds humanity's last remnant of max 2000 people, half of which must apparently live in Nazi prison camp conditions and be content with eating protein bars made from bugs and doing nothing else, while the other half apparently don't do much more than dance, eat nice food we never see grow and groom themselves.If that is the future of humanity then somebody please blow the train up.",Snowpiercer

It makes you wonder whether some stars bother to read the script before signing up for some movies. Despite a star cast this is a truly messed up film with an illogical plot and totally unbelievable scenarios.I will try and make this spoiler free and rely on information from the movie previews and advertising.First, why a train? It just makes no sense to save humanity in a post-apocalyptic world covered in snow and ice. There are so many hazards that could stop the train, that would require people to go outside to fix that it just makes the whole premise unbelievable. The risk of derailment alone would have this thrown out of a brain-storming session for 'ideas to save humanity' that it wouldn't even make the first cut.The special effects are okay, nothing spectacular. Some bizarre concepts for what the world would look like if it froze over that just don't add up if you go with the films timelime and back story.The acting isn't terrible given the poor script that they had to work with. It's just a real shame that with the great cast of actors that this wasn't a better film. The stand out actress for me will be obvious to you. Ed Harris just plays the same role as he does in The Truman Show.There is a point near the end of the film where, if you had managed to make it that far, you will get to the 'goal' of one of the main protagonists with their saved up stash and just think WTF!

I know Bong Joon-Ho is a serious and skilled film maker with aspirations to challenge AND entertain, but this movie is pretentious, unwatchable, and freaking ENDLESS. You thought ""Lord Of The Rings"" took forever to end? You ain't seen nothin'...this turkey goes on and on and on...and keeps going,even though the story lost any momentum after the first two minutes.The plot, such as it is, involves a high speed train that circles the globe in the wake of severe climate change; the entire earth is in a constant state of sub-arctic temperture, and all of the surviving earthlings are passengers of one sort or another on the train. Upper-crust elites reside in the front, and the lowers castes in the back.There is class struggle. There is inequality. There is dialogue that would make Haystacks Calhoun wince. Rebellion...betrayal! But wait, it's not really betrayal it's...rebellion! Hoo boy...I wish I could travel back in time, and undo my unfortunate decision to watch this smoldering mess of apocalyptic claptrap.

Every characters perfectly played their part, as if they were being directed by someone.Which might be the aspect that made the movie less engrossing for me. Everyone is too much the, stereotype is too strong of a word, but they are too much on the nose for who they playing. so it felt like i was watching a movie, instead of being drawn into a story.Once thing I wish movies like this would stop doing is try to make them hopeful. this is a movie showing just how horrible human beings are.

The storyline was very appealing...a miniature version of human society in a train where God is played by a man controlling the engine...but despite of some brilliant sequences, it failed at some levels. It keeps you hooked in certain portions of the movie but then in other portions..you simply feel craving for more or something better and end of the movie is one of that portion. Anyways, this movie does not have multiple viewing appeal and it is a one time watch in my opinion. it is a good mix of action, some suspense and story to hold all together to some extent. It is definitely one time watch and not a waste of time if inadvertently i have suggested otherwise above but that said, when you watch it, you will feel, gosh, it could have been so much better.",Snowpiercer
603,lacqueredmouse,Bong's Folly,4,15 June 2014,"Where does one start on this piece of work? Bong Joon-ho's first film in English comes on the back of a wildly divergent back catalogue, including the sublime Madeo (Mother), the tedious crime/procedural Memories of Murder and blockbuster monster-film The Host. But I think this film may be his most divisive yet.There is so much, seemingly, to like in this film. It's a warped experiment in genre-production, with (very thinly veiled) political overtones—and it has the platform for a very good piece of social commentary. The production and art design are exquisite, and Bong stretches his art department in every shot, sometimes verging into the overt whimsy of Jeunet or Gilliam. And there are some really strong, extremely unusual performances, especially from Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer and a wonderful scene-stealer from Alison Pill.But despite all of these things, I felt the film as a whole was an abject failure—and worse, it verged on the horrific. I feel perhaps the film should come to be known known as Bong's Folly. For a while it manages to contain its misguided lunacy, but time after time the direction of the film flips in such frantically perverse ways that it started to sicken me.Bong has juxtaposed three very distinct elements in the film: the politically-laced themes of oppression, the bizarre use of surreal humour and a shockingly graphic portrayal of violence. And he often places these elements so close together that the results are horrifying. A scene in which the main character admits to having eaten babies ""because they taste the best"" is portrayed with the same sense of conflicted amusement as is a truly comic scene involving the indoctrination of a school class. There's an anarchy and unpleasantness to the film that permeates everything.This isn't even to mention some of the genuinely ridiculous plot-holes, or the extremely outré, implausible premise of the film itself. Despite the unpredictable changes in tone, the plot itself is remarkably pedestrian, and the twists in the storyline are tired and overused in many such genre pieces. The political commentary was clumsy as well, meaning that even if we were engaged with the style of the film, its message was slammed in our faces with the subtlety of a concrete fish.It's the exaggeration, the violence and the lack of restraint to this film that is its ultimate demise. This was a meretricious film that tried to engage you with its stylistic charm while it brutalised your soul with its unpleasantness. I genuinely hope I'm not the only one that feels this way.",Snowpiercer

Besides all the characters in the movie were doing such overacting as they were doing their debuts in film industry. Captain America! Believe me Sir, You are better than this.Movie ending is pretty bad just to add more to its other shortcomings.This movie is NOT recommended folks.

Yes there are a lot of plot points that don't make much sense if looked at from the perspective of our ""reality."" But this film does NOT aim to be ""realistic."" In fact, I'd say the goal of the director is to make it as ""surrealistic"" as possible. And I applaud him to be so successful in that: in many moments during the film, I felt I was experiencing a fevered dream of a fried fish. -- That's how insane this film is. It takes great genius to present something as insane as the plot of Snowpiercer.This film will be remembered, analyzed and revered for a long, long time.

607,williamhuds,I have mixed feelings,4,2 August 2015,"Okay so it's difficult for me to write down my feelings, as I oscillate between liking this movie and hating it. On one hand it puts forth a quirky, neat, and interesting dystopian society wherein all of society is relegated to a train car, which is neat. BUT on the flip side, it falls prey to all of the overdone dystopian tropes of late; a la the wise john hurt figure who turns out to know more than he lets on, it basically pulls a matrix with the whole ""the train is really fueled by people!"" and the whole ""your revolt was planned"" thing. Cinematically it's a really fun movie, characters are very strange and quirky, for better or worse, and even though there were massive plot holes, I felt extremely invested. To prevent myself from rambling further, basically this movie flys closer to Elysium than District 9, in that it presents a pretty hollow social commentary, has a lot of plot holes, but I think unlike Elysium, it has some heart, which makes it hard to review objectively. If you like hard sci fi, don't watch this movie, don't even consider this movie. But if you like soft sci fi/dystopias, this is a pretty fun ride, though don't think about it too hard or it'll reveal how shallow its commentary really is.",Snowpiercer

(Slight Spoiler alert),10,8 April 2014,"This is a great movie.You know every so often you come across that just lifts you off your seat and is of such quality that you stop calling it a movie and look at it like was a piece of art. This is one of those movies.I see people write about the absurd setting on a train with a perpetual motor and all that and i say it's sci-fi. Put it to the side and view this movie as the art it is.The idea of a sub class at the back of a train is just so intriguing. Like a mini country with its downtrodden at the back and the super rich at the front.John Hurt, as per usual brings his colossal talent to bear. The old boy can sure act. Its like he played Caligula in I Caesar just yesterday. Always a pleasure to watch this old mater school the world in acting.Then there's Tilda Swinton as Mason. Just so entirely disconnected to be absolutely and brilliantly right for the job. A stunning performance when she steps up to the mike and says ""1,2,3. 1,2"" after the fight scene (and what a fight scene) and then calls them scum. I must admit I let loose a good laugh.So much to this movie I could rant about. It is just a piece of art. I wish it had of lasted twice as long.This is a great movie. A GREAT MOVIE.

609,patrick-568-387329,Way overrated....,4,23 April 2015,"I honestly don't know why this movie has such a high rating. The plot did not particularly interest me, but I went ahead and watched it anyway, based on the rating, hoping it would turn out to be good. Turns out I wasted my time instead. I guess it is one of those things, that people tend to vote for something 'different' and 'weird'. Kinda similar to the Eurovision Song Contest really, where a good song does not count, but being different or weird does get you votes. This movie lacked any kind of logic or sense. OK, it is science fiction, but jeez, 2012 was way more realistic with its version of the end of the world than this. Come on, pools inside a train? Aquariums with a tunnel through them? Any idea how stupid and impossible that sounds? Not to mention the fact that nobody inside the train seemed to experience any kind of problems with the movement of the train. Or wait, maybe it was a maglev train? The acting was not that brilliant either. I could name a bunch of other things, but I feel I have wasted enough time on the movie itself already. if you feel like watching something totally insane and illogical, then go for it, knock yourself out. If you are instead looking for a more realistic movie, don't bother wasting your time on it, there's plenty of much better disaster movies out there.",Snowpiercer
610,heidistandell,"This movie has a bit of everything, but it works!",9,23 March 2014,"First of all, I'm not a great fan of sci-fi, or extremely negative futurism, or bloody battle scenes- -though don't get me wrong, I've loved some films within all of those genres. I'm a cinema addict, but the films I tend to rate the highest are the quiet little gems you find just once in awhile. I saw this movie at a preview last night, and while this film has all of the ingredients that make for an entertaining ride and nothing more, it also has a lot more going on. The plot is very engaging and despite the length of the film I can promise you, you won't find yourself at all bored and wanting that extra bag of popcorn, and the dialogue, while over the top at times, goes along with the purposely pompous and pretentious characters who, despite being stereotypical, are so well drawn and acted that they surprise the viewer nonetheless. I can't give it a 10/10 -- that's a high mark I reserve for very few films. However, I found myself thinking about this one long after I had watched it. I don't want to give anything away, but it is a complex movie filmed most wonderfully by its director and cinematographer, full of characters who play against the straight and clichéd ""hero"" of the story, if he can be called that, with a finesse and flair that makes the story and the scenes stay with you long after the film is over. Two thumbs up, and more (if I had more thumbs, unfortunately I am condemned to just the two lol).",Snowpiercer
611,tobiasfrolov,Why this movie makes sense and is awesome,7,28 July 2014,"Frankly, if you watch this movie like a regular sci-fi action film rather than an allegory for social commentary, then it's not going to make a whole lot of sense (as other reviewers has been eager to point out with their long lists of plot-holes and vice versa). So I'm going to make it easy for you and provide a quick explanation about the main themes and why they work beautifully, especially with the ending. SPOILERS AHEAD! The train represents ideas that many people embrace without question. Some of the more obvious allegories in the movie relates to social hierarchy, faith and religion but you can (and should) imagine the train as representative for dogma of any kind. People living on the train are subject to the idea that they need the train to survive and everything on board is designed to keep the masses within this very belief-system. This is of course, as we learn through the course of the film, all in spite of the fact that the outside has become quite hospitable during the 18 years in which the train has been in motion. But, much like the physical path of the train itself, there is a circular tendency in the mind of its inhabitants that is very hard to break. The irony that really shines though at the end of this movie is that if people had just agreed to stop the train, everybody would have been better off (as Willard points out, even the high class citizens are really prisoners as well). But because of the dogmatic belief littered within the train, change has to be radical in order to take hold, and so almost everybody ends up dead when the train crashes.My advice is to view this movie as a beautiful, spot-on piece of social commentary, or not at all.",Snowpiercer

This movie is like a very pointless linear video game - it basically has levels that the main (unlikable) characters have to progress through to reach the end. Each level has some novel and random twist, but the twists are just unpleasant and stupid.I had a bad feeling about this movie from the start, beginning as it does with one of those news-radio sound-bite montages about how we ruined the planet attempting to fix it. This is hackneyed and clunky exposition to say the least.I give this two stars because the visuals are decent. The plot is absent, the violence is over-the-top and absurd without offering anything really new (think Old Boy but ramped-up), the main protagonists are near-invincible, and the whole thing is distasteful and meaningless.The featured review on this film has a guy comparing this to Robocop.

It follows a tired, linear plot from the back of the train to the front. Snowpiercer is painfully blatant about it's theme - the conflict of social status. I'm sure there was a deeper metaphor hidden in each cart I overlooked and I positively enjoyed its closing minutes but the movie is not conveyed well enough to be appreciated by me.My rubric: 2. You and I, we could make something more engrossing with a million dollars and the length of the runtime. Absolutely dreadful, a total drag - save yourself. 4. Average. Post-mortem of your mildly entertained time, you are unenthused. 6. The threshold for willful re-watching. You get excited when it's brought up casually in conversation. 8. The go-to movies. You've employed yourself to actively advertise someone else's work to share the satisfaction. The obsession extends beyond promotion and into understanding.

Second, what was the idea of leaving only two people to repopulate the planet and not only two ordinary people but a five year old kid and an eighteen year old girl.

You only barely get to even care at all about any of the characters because there is just so much fighting that there is almost no time for character development. The fighting is not particularly well done either; its not totally unbelievable but neither is it very convincing.In summation, a modestly interesting story that is only a small portion of the movie doesn't salvage this train wreck (yes that's an intentional pun) Overall, disappointing and feel free to move along to something else, you aren't missing much.",Snowpiercer

622,DoomsdayDevice,Good film that struggles to execute its best ideas.,7,27 September 2019,"I went in this movie expecting it to be some really messed up commentary on social classes and the such, since thats what I inferred due to such a high rating. What I got was a very competent action movie with some decent writing from time to time and a lot of creative ideas.Although I spent most of the movie trying to dishearn if Cecil was actually Chris Evans or not, I still had an enjoyable enough time with the movie to give it a pass. Chris Evans character is very bland and the attempts they make to try and develop his character usually fall flat. This is partly due to spotty writing, and partly due to the fact that Chris Evans is awful in the role. He grumbles and mumbles his lines until the movie needs him to be emotional at one point. Hes just hollywood protagonist #441 at this point.None of these characters have enough depth to them for me to care about them dying like the movie obviously expects you too. Like, the mother of ""Timmy"" was such a one dimensional character and I felt that if she would've just gotten one more scene in to make her character actually important to the plot then she would've fared so much better. Instead, she just says something about missing her son and then she dies. Thats literally all her character is.However, that being said- I liked a few characters in this movie. The character played by Tilda Swinton was very well written and Swinton brings a slimey presence that really drives the character into the ground as a good character. Shes also the funniest thing in this movie. I also liked the druggie father and daughter, the daughter is up to par with her father, character wise. I actually thought that his little spheel at the end of the movie was more entertaining and captivating than Chris Evans because of how Chris cant even manage to cry a little.The story makes it painfully obvious that its going to be a by the books ""revolution"" type story were our titular characters rise up against the big rich meanie heads.
Although there are some creative ideas integrated in the story, most of it is predictable and by the 3rd act, you can tell that its the ""villain wants protag to take his throne"" type deal we've seen time and time again.
The story sort of drags when its so predictable like this, but it was still entertaining because of the wealth of creative ideas at hand.I liked when the man was being punished by having his arm hang out the window of the train. Its a creative way to do someone in considering the context of the world they live in and it does a lot to build the world and make it more fleshed out.
There are more things about this movie like this, which i admire.The ending wasn't the best, many unanswered questions, not saying thats bad, but it still doesn't account for the fact that we get a irrelevant ending. What happened to Chris? Are there like no other survivors? Is the only purpose this ending serves to say ""hey, actually they were lying to you and uhhh live is able to thrive on earth still"" it feels like a cop out ending and the movie was just entertaining enough to keep me wondering what has happened to these characters. But alas, no deposit, no return.Overall, Snowpiercer is a competent movie yet its not as smart as it thinks it is. The execution is hit or miss. The story is sort of lame and conventional. Other than that, it checks out.",Snowpiercer

629,kowloonzai,Metropolis of the new century,9,3 November 2013,"No spoilers here !Remember Metropolis, the great silent film by Fritz Lang, and probably the most revered science-fiction film of all times ? Well, if Snowpiercer is not such an absolute masterpiece, I do believe it's the best reiteration of the same concept that made Lang's film so unique : asking questions about the condition of mankind in a futuristic society, and how it does and does not evolve as compared with current times. It's good that not all near-blockbuster scale sci-fi movies do not come out of Hollywood anymore. Snowpiercer is based on a long-forgotten 70's French graphic novel. The Korean director got his hands on a bootleg translation in a Seoul bookshop while filming The Host and got totally hooked. The end product is a French-Korean production, in the making of which one of the authors of the original graphic novel got directly involved. The plot is simple : ecologist freaks have pushed governments to unleash a gas in the atmosphere to control global warming, this proved so effective that the world is now a standalone, snow-covered giant ice cap. The only survivors are all aboard a revolutionary train that goes on and on making loops around the world. It's like Noah's Ark, but including the politics that come with it : first class, second class, workers, fraudsters, the ticket is your fate - for generations. And the consequences are extreme, to such and extent that you can't conceive. Prepare to be shocked at times. Imagine the vertical multistoreyed humanity of Lang's Metropolis, the horizontal way. Some of the tail section fraudsters decide to rebel against their condition and progress to the head car of the train regardless of the risks. Every car they go through bears its grotesque and mind-bending surprises. And tells us more about how this society actually works and what it relies on. This film has style. Even though it reminds of Gilliam (see 12 monkeys) and Matsumoto (Galaxy Express), there is real personality and originality. CGI is limited to a few breathtaking scenes that really add up to the storyline. Acting is mostly excellent, especially by Ed Harris and John Hurt. But most importantly, this film triggers reflection, soul-searching and debate like true Sci-Fi gems should. Unlike most Hollywood movies, it is not Manichaean : the story and morals are complex and debatable. You heart keeps swinging for scene to scene as you learn more. The ending asks a lot of questions. All in all, when the end credits start rolling, it's a film you want to rewatch, not because you haven't understood, but because you want to understand more, and experience more.",Snowpiercer
630,charybdis-m,All aboard the crazy train,9,20 November 2014,"First, I have to say that it's been a while (about seven months) since I've seen this film. The reason I decided to write a review anyway, is because this movie sticks in my mind like I'd imagine a protein jelly block would stick between your teeth.Snowpiercer was part of a Sneak Preview program so I had no idea what to expect. Look, there's a train. There's people in it. It almost looks like a society. Wait a minute... it IS a society! As the movie went on the only coherent thought in my head was 'holy sh*t'.By the time I'm writing this there are 353 reviews for this film already. About the content, style and acting performances, there's not much left to say. The only thing I can do is HIGHLY RECOMMEND you see this. I mean it. Snowpiercer blew me away and left me speechless when the movie was over. It took me weeks to process it all, and after about two months I finally got some of the more underlying metaphors. This just seems to stick with me. I still think about it every now and then. I haven't seen it since, and I haven't seen it come out anywhere in theaters in my country, but if you can get your hands on this movie, I suggest you go see it. Just buckle up and enjoy the ride.",Snowpiercer
631,pfate12,"Shallow, illogical and totally FUN B-movie action",7,6 February 2015,"Forget the reviews whining about the plot holes (yes, there are tons). Pay no attention to those people who genuinely believe Joon- ho Bong is making a profound statement about humanity, society, or pending environmental catastrophes. Don't waste time over-analyzing the film's ending and whether or not it matters to the rest of the story. Sit down, grab some popcorn, and enjoy this stylistic and completely original action flick set inside a train, carrying the last of the human race, traveling endlessly around the now uninhabitable frozen earth. When was the last time you saw a film with that setting?The plot is simple enough. Our heroes are third-class citizens, confined to a lifetime of captivity in the back of the train. Their oppressors deny them freedom, information, luxuries and dignity, for seemingly no other reason besides them being residents of the tail. Several rebellions have been attempted by the tail inhabitants in the years preceding the events in the film, none successful but the characters and their surroundings bear the scars of years of injustice and violent defeat. The lighting, costumes, colors, grunginess created by Bong during the first act are critical in establishing the dark reality that our heroes have had to endure for the 17 years that the train has been operational. The actors appear unkempt, worn, and at times exhausted, and portray their characters with a believable survivalist resilience that is necessary to propel the story.Eventually a well-choreographed and terrifically filmed action- rebellion sequence takes place, and our heroes spend the rest of the film trying to get to the front of the train, forcing their way from car to car, to seek justice and answers. This is where the film becomes the most fun as it indulges in absurdity, grandiosity, violence and shock value. Each train car is a unique environment: a greenhouse, school classroom, slaughterhouse, aquarium Each presents a new physical and psychological challenge for our heroes, and a new perspective on the essence of the train itself. If the viewer is wondering why the classroom car is next to the prison car, or why the nightclub is nearest to the front, or why we never see any residential cars, they are missing point. The claustrophobic environment of each car serves to heighten the peril our heroes feel when confronted by the bad guys, while also substantially increasing the intensity of the action. Even the bad guys must control their excessive force to a point, lest they risk derailing the train or cutting off their escape/retreat path to safety. One bad guy of note, actually a bad girl to be precise, is the character Mason played brilliantly by a barely recognizable Tilda Swinton. Homely and unpolished yet borderline comical, Ms. Swinton hits just the right note as a merciless, craven and utterly repellent hag. Her performance embodies the tone of the film, unsightly, amusing, capricious, but most of all FUN.",Snowpiercer
632,john-graboski,An unbelievable incoherent mess,4,14 October 2021,It's action filled desperate hectic incoherent mess. An with so many a listers that makes it even more disappointing. I suppose it might be good if you don't mind a weak wandering plot. Don't bother.,Snowpiercer
633,noumanqaiser,Week plot overall filled with loop holes,4,2 February 2021,The story starts off with a great post apocalypse era where a bunch of humans are left. The writer fails to explain why humans need to keep on a train and why life doesn't exist on isolated warmer places. Neither does the plot do justice to why a train that kept running without stop for 17 years would fail to survive a door opening blast. Additionally the display of misery for the tail sectioners was a bit over done. The dialogues were longer and boring then they could have been. The only reason why I wouldnt rate the movie as 1 star is the because the writer managed to twist the story at a scene when the leader of revolution finds out that he was used as a part of a larger plan.,Snowpiercer
634,GlenFalkensteinTodaytoKnights,Snowpiercer: What do you achieve at the end of time?,9,16 June 2014,"Chris Evans is finished. The young, handsome, highly prolific Captain America has announced that he will not pursue acting beyond his Marvel Contract and the Avengers sequels. So what does an actor with every door open to him do with no time left? This one made Snowpiercer.Set in 2031, 17 years after global warming heralded a frozen apocalypse and the destruction of the world's population, the only survivors ride a bullet train whose tracks circumnavigate the globe every year, keeping its passengers safe from the cold. As in H.G.Wells' 'The Time Machine' a devastating future has divided the survivors into two camps, the 3rd-class unfortunates relegated to the back of the train (Chris Evans, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell and John Hurt, amongst others) and the privileged, represented by an almost unrecognisable Tilda Swinton as Mason.Curtis (Evans) and his compatriots struggle daily with their lot, cognisant, resentful and largely unexposed to the lifestyles of those in the front carriages as Mason holds up a shoe to remind the squalid that they are the foot whilst she is the head, their order having been pre-ordained. Curtis begins a struggle to liberate his peers and along with the others advance through the carriages against their oppressors. Think the 'Train' stage on Goldeneye with terminal winter.The large-scale battles between Curtis, his crew and their oppressors are numerous while the one-on-one fight scenes are fewer and far in between. The film is not unlike 300 in that a small crew have to combat a larger and seemingly insurmountable foe; most notably during an axe fight Curtis storms down the carriage up-ending enemies in slow motion as the Spartan leader had done before him, having foregone in this case Leonidas' hardened battle gear.The collective action endears the group as a whole rather than any one individual which unfortunately means that we don't get to spend nearly enough time with any character except Curtis before they are wantonly killed as if they were beloved Starks. Spencer is neglectfully underutilized with Swinton getting most of the good lines and action, Alison Pill from 'The Newsroom' makes a noteworthy cameo. The constant death nevertheless reminds us of Curtis' world in which all that we know has gone and where like in Casablanca, life is cheap.The oppressed marvel at lost wonders like sushi and eggs to really bring home the post-global warming hellscape, but it is belief that actually drives this movie. Wilfred, the engineer responsible for the sacred engine, is upheld as the divine keeper who saved everyone's lives with his iconographic 'W' appearing everywhere you look. In this brave new world there is no place for another religion and like the 'Model T' is the basis for a new order which the disgruntled are forced to challenge.Imagine Wall-E in live-action where the protagonist survives a climate-ridden wasteland to encounter a privileged class oblivious to the reality around them even when our heroes rear their heads; just with more violence. Curtis makes his way through the carriages past many who confront him and others who don't seem to care, finally reaching a confrontational and not unsatisfying finale.Snowpiercer does beleaguer the point about global warming with constant reminders of the devastation the phenomenon has brought on the planet, most evident through the opening credits-overlay. In spite of this the film is not preachy and is ultimately a good thriller.Curtis was desperate. Evans is not. They're both running up to the end of time with the latter possessing more choices than the character he portrayed. Turned out he made a good call.",Snowpiercer

637,ttgog,"Great Idea But, Out of Place, Out of Reality...",2,26 October 2014,"I only checked the ""Spoiler"" box because of how much stuff I have in here.Over all this was a high budget ""B"" movie at best. The idea was great. The story followed the idea but swayed from reality too many times. The screen credits at the beginning seemed out of sorts. More like a TV show. The CGI stuff was good.Curtis and the bad guy shooting through the windows at each other from a thousand feet away with short range weapons was a waste of time. That type of shot is next to impossible to begin with. (Unless you have a million rounds to practice with) Cock roaches are always plentiful enough, they're easy to raise. (They Raise themselves) I thought Ed Harris' steak was one of the kids because they never showed any cows. But then later they showed the kids.They mentioned the train being 20 or 30 cars long. Likely because they did not know how many there were. An external shot near the end showed 80+ cars, yet the movie showed them moving through, what, maybe a dozen cars? Jamie Bell seems to be a potty mouth in every movie he's in.The aquarium was awesome. Couldn't help noticing a stingray swimming around. Makes me wonder what the Sushi was made of.Of all the people on the train, our hero is the one who slips on a fish? Speaking of fish... the bad guys dipping their axes in the fishes blood??? Is that some ritual we're not familiar with? The bad guy in the sauna suddenly became the terminator.When the lights go out, instead of the good guys attacking when they see the lights start to go out, they wait for the bad guys to start killing them? There's 9 million metal bars, pieces of train, sticks, crow bars, and a host of other elongated objects on the train yet our hero sticks his arm down in the gears to rescue a black child from certain peril.The raggedy, war torn hero's of this magnificent piece stop to eat Sushi in the middle of the film. Tried to let that one roll to the back of my brain... Nothing's registered yet. Why wasn't there a McDonald's midway through the train? Why didn't they show them throwing dead bodies off the train? Or were they to become the next helping of Soylent Green? The goofy chick's speech after putting the shoe on that guys head was totally weird. Then they go through all the hoo-ha of freezing that guys arm and then they don't show it breaking off? That was lame. No wait, let me guess, they didn't want too much violence in this film, right? They claim that there were a thousand people living back in the rear of the train, yet only about a hundred came forward to fight.Stopping the fight to wish happy new year was limp. The good guys should strapped on a pair and rushed the bad guys.After taking a shower the third class people still looked like crap.Am I the only one catching the idea of a train that has run around the planet for 18 years and has never stopping for maintenance, like wheels, or bearings, or grease? I am confused about one thing: Everyone on the planet is killed from freezing to death except the people on the train... So, instead of young people thinking and plotting a way to fix the problem and restoring life on the planet, they go from a pristine old fashioned stereotype school room education to a car on the train devoted to being the equivalent of an opium den? Am I understanding this correctly? What an ending. The 17 year old girl surviving at the end and staring at a polar bear and then cutting to the credits was a terrible way to end the film. Did the polar bear eat her and the black child in peril? If our hero took Ed Harris up on his offer, did the chunky broad in the yellow jacket come with the deal? She was hot. She had to measure everything, so I guess I wouldn't really want to hook up with her... Never mind.",Snowpiercer
638,s-aitken88,"1984, Animal Farm, and now Snowpiercer.",10,17 August 2013,"Absolutely amazing. A cinematic microcosm of society. For those of you uninterested in topics like '1984' and 'Animal Farm', watch this film for a hazard course in understanding the human condition. From start to end you see a small-scale depiction of society from it's most basic 'proletariat' level, right up to the elite, in perfect order. And we see the evolution of civilisation from simple beginnings to science, education, quality, luxury, then hedonism, wastefulness and eventual demise, in exactly that order.All of that can be overlooked, however, if you're just the average movie-goer who simply wants a good story with a hero, an adventure and an end goal. In which case I say the film is a good one but nothing special in that respect. Certainly there were parts where I thought, ""eh?"", until it clicked later that it was all part of the Director's greater cinematic design.But for the arty film student types, this film is sure to be the topic of many, many essays for years to come.Clearly every part of the film was deliberate - every shot, every line of script, every item in the background. It was true art. None of that quick-buck profit-incentive Hollywood stuff.In conclusion I recommend this film to everyone, particularly people who want to learn something or gain some insight from what they watch. For the everyday movie-lover, go into this with an open mind and have a really long think about how you can compare it to the world today.Top stuff, 10/10",Snowpiercer

If you didn't like City of Ember you won't like this one either.I rented it online and so glad I didn't watch it in a theatre for two reasons: 1. would've wasted more money, 2. would've wasted more time taking into account commute time.The plot has logical holes, sometimes it just doesn't make sense. Actors' play is so so. It is a depressing movie. I understand why it didn't play in major theatres in Toronto - simply because they didn't believe people would come and watch it.It takes place in a confined space with a very small room for creativity and imagination. The movie had a huge potential had the stage been taken outside of that space, with some quest through snow covered places and cities, with some fantastic animals that had to adapt to cold temperatures etc. And if you could make good visual effects this movie would have been a hit.",Snowpiercer
642,Mrrogersbestneighbor,"Spoilers on the bottom, safe to read until CAPS. This movie is a ride, plot holes irrelevant.",9,25 July 2018,"When I was looking at the negative reviews, they seemed completely focused on the fact that there are some major plots holes. I'll list some of the major ones with potential explanations at the bottom. But I find the plot holes completely irrelevant (even for ones you can't possibly come up with any creative explanation for), considering this obviously isn't a movie to be taken 100% seriously. If it was, why did they insert a comedic bit mid film? Hell, the entire plot is the last of humanity is surviving on a train that goes across the entire globe... Why anyone would think that a movie with a plot such as this is meant to be taken completely seriously as a realistic possible doomsday scenario is beyond me. Even in the biggest movies, like Star Wars, you could list dozens of plot holes. Like just one example, what is the point of lightsabers when you have guns that shoot lasers? The answer is because they're cool and F off for taking that movie completely seriously when it's clearly one of those great movies that you need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the universe it creates. 
Plot holes imo, are usually only a major problem in a film when they involve interpersonal interactions (like when characters lack all communication skills to artificially move the plot forward, like a character somehow doesn't think to say something EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that would have solved or prevented a problem) or if the movie is attempting to be true to reality as something that is probable. There are no such plot holes in this movie. 
With that out of the way, the movie has all the great elements of most movies. Character development, the pacing is great, a bit of action, comedy and creates an interesting surreal dark world that is entertaining to watch unfold. It almost has some elements of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Signal"" in style. A huge proportion of the characters are completely insane and it works great for a movie like this (which again, why would you take it seriously in the first place after reading the plot synopsis?)
If you aren't looking for plot holes or explanations for the entirety of the movie and are capable to suspend disbelief, enjoy a bit of dark comedy, some violence and a fairly unique apocalyptic political dynamic among A LOT of crazy people in the unique universe it creates you're in for a ride.NOW FOR THE PLOT HOLE EXPLANATIONS.
SPOILERS:
1. People frozen out the window haven't thawed. How can they then survive outside of the train. It's clearly still extremely cold.
Potential explanation- The people that jumped the train left at the wrong time. The train goes up and down in altitude and crosses all over the planet where places will be warmer or colder depending on where you are.
Also, people have discovered frozen people in mountains before. You know that right? Just because someone is frozen, doesn't mean it isn't possible to live anywhere if you have clothing that is sufficiently warm. Once you're dead, your body doesn't produce any heat. When your alive, it does. Completely possible for people to be frozen and the climate to still be viable to live in. 
2. Couldn't they just have had a policy limiting the number of children they produce to control the population?
There's a couple explanations you could come up with to explain that. 1) Like in China, perhaps they did, but it never worked. Turns out people still have sex when you have a population control policy. And birth control is something you could easily run out of with limited resources (shouldn't need that explanation, since it's pretty obvious). And 2) It's been pretty well documented that depression and suicide rates go up when a population isn't at war. When there isn't anything to fight for or any crisis, a substantial amount of people lose meaning in life. Having this artificial crisis can provide meaning for a population who would likely be VERY prone to depression, when the entire purpose of their life is simply to survive in a train.",Snowpiercer

It kept my attention all the way through but I thought it was a bit slow at times... that could also be with the color choice of the film. Since the colors were dulled to a white and muted- gray, I think it took away from the energy and kept a lot of the feeling on the same level negating an arc of energy and suspense to some degree.The ending also made me drop my rating from an 8 to a 7. The acting was good though and it was shot pretty well. The visual effects were good. The train flying around tracks and all of the snow looked pretty real and kept me into the movie. The crash also was well done.I've always liked Octavia Spencer and she was great. When I see Chris Evans, I can only think of Not Another Teen Movie so it takes some of the credibility away, although he didn't do a bad job. Ed Harris was good, but maybe a bit too casual in his performance. I think he could have had some more fun with the role.The movie is also a bit long.

At the end of the film two people go outside , and low and behold it's not that cold and there's even polar bears living outside.

654,JordsMeintjes,Snowpiercer Review:,5,15 September 2020,"Once the film had ended, it was the exciting moments that lingered with me more so than the disappointing ones. Most aspects had me entertained, the choreography, the comic-book comedy and quirkiness of the characters, and the great escape-esque plot. The performance of Chris Evans drew you in and the comedic nature of Tilda Swinton's portrayal kept you entertained. Initially I jumped on the praise train, thinking the cinematography and choreography alone made this a great movie. Though since commencing this review, certain things kept gnawing at me, making me realize I didn't enjoy certain choices made or the narrative it displayed.
As stated before, I enjoyed the choreography, some sequences had you on the edge of your seat, others had you intentionally disturbed, all of which had been completed in tight spaces. It was impressive and thrilling to watch. The cinematography was also compelling, it didn't rely on the shaky-camera method to pass any of the action sequences, it panned out of each train carriage in clever ways, and even with the restrictions of space on the set pieces, it didn't feel claustrophobic. The set pieces were surprising too, each carriage brought a different feel and played heavily into the light comedic nature of film.
The story of the film is quite simplistic, pushing semi-political themes of oppression with the poor, barbaric, and inequal treatment of others. Some of the smaller details, I feel, didn't make sense. These details include the discovery of what is in the protein blocks that are being fed to the members of the tail carriages. These people, who have confessed to not only cannibalism but the eating of babies, are astonishingly shocked that the food being given to them are insects. Perpetual motion is the basis to how the passengers have survived, it's unclear how they obtained the insects if that's the case. It's the case with most science fiction work but this film needs the suspension of disbelief in more ways than the usual. It becomes increasingly difficult not to become critical as the movie progresses: Soldiers were equipped with no bullets in the one place that they were needed, limbs were taken very well with minimal screaming or looks of pain, and a man stabbed and choked seemingly to death wakes up and continues on his killing spree looking fine. Moments like this take away from the enjoyment shown from the action sequences.
The progression and climax of the second half of the film was free from the excitement that came from the first half. With the antagonist spewing information that wasn't seen and only hinted at in one poorly conveyed instance. Who was Gilliam to Wilford? Was Gilliam in agreement with Wilford's way? The ending was not nearly as dramatic or engaging as it traded the thrilling mystery, and the answers needed, for philosophical thought that is appears in place of answers.
Overall, the action sequences were impressive, and the set pieces were interesting. The story starts off thrilling but suffers from not having a satisfying end.Review Score: 5/10",Snowpiercer
655,mike-3570,Leave no cliché unturned. Some spoilers.,4,11 July 2019,"I had some reservations about this before I watched it, but with Tilda Swinton on board i assumed that would be some kind of quality assurance.As dystopian warnings about the future are concerned, this is about as heavy handed as it gets. A class system even more startly divided than Orwell's proles.Soylent green equivalent for supper.Clichés abound. The class system, the metaphorical layers of hell, the hero, the quest, the turncoat sidekick, the complicit leader, the benevolent dictator, the train itself as metaphor... there is no room for ambiguity here, your thoughts are guided every step of the way.Some of the fight scenes are frankly ridiculous - I think maybe set up to five an 'old boy' feel to the confines of the railway carriage, but it just didnt work.And finally, the big spoiler...He was only supposed to blow the bloody doors off. Not bring about the destruction of the whole of humanity except two. That's just silly. And the polar bear at the end, supposed to give hope... in 18 years would nobody have seen one before, and figured if a bear can live out there we can? I mean, it wasnt even that cold.

656,tmccracken-52050,"Rather pretentious, and that is putting it kindly",3,2 January 2021,"Lots of other people have mentioned the various plot holes. For me, the biggest plot hole is that the people in the back of the train serve no useful purpose for the people in the front. No one has jobs on this train. Everyone is either sitting around a bar, at a rave, or wallowing in their own misery. Except for the security people of course. Who are very lax at their job.It tries to be a symbol of wealth inequality. It fails.",Snowpiercer

658,skipoc,Paycheck movie,3,14 March 2015,"do not, under ANY circumstances, allow yourself to be subjected to this garbage. It was awful from start to finish. The only reason I stuck it out was Tilda Swinton. She was apparently working with a different script and looked embarrassed throughout. The script was clichéd and the camera work amateurish (no disrespect to amateurs intended). The director should never be allowed NEAR a camera again. It wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen but it's in the Top 10. I give it 3 stars only because i felt sorry for Swinton. She deserves better as do the rest of the cast. I hope the actors all received healthy paychecks because there really is no other reason for doing this bomb. I can't imagine anyone looking at this script and screaming ""YES YES! I MUST do this.""

I can honestly say this is one of the best movies in the post-apocalyptic and dystopian genres to come out in recent history. I understand that a lot of people had problems with the ending and l also think it could have been handled differently but in the end l don't think it takes away too much. That being said the ending is the main reason I've given this film 8 stars instead of 10.Everyone gives a great performance in this film. l genuinely hated Tilda Swinton's character(even though she truck me as a bit of a one-dimensional, generic villain) and was rooting for captain America till the end. Even though l probably would have made a different choice in the end. Then again that's why he's the hero of the story and not me. The cinematography and camera work is superb, the director manages to communicate a lot to the audience trough simple camera work and framing and not just trough dialogue. Most of the characters a fully fleshed out and have very interesting arcs and motivations. All in all Snowpiercer is surprisingly good movie and l believe it will be a great watch for everyone, if you don't mind the ending that is.

Still, things are not covered by snow after 17 winters. The list is extensive, but probably not worth writing, and other reviewers have done it already. Hundreds of people in the front sections of the train, but no living quarters. No explanation whatsoever as to why a magic train was a better solution than using the engine to power an underground compound or some other reasonable arrangement. A shootout at a school with the teacher and the kids magically disappear. Meanwhile, the guards dealing with the people at the tail section had no bullets but the teacher did?Anyway, awful movie.

663,tuckersworkmail,Horrible,1,24 November 2014,"The plot is ridiculously bad yet the movie is almost done as if it's somehow serious. The acting is bad, the sound work is not good, the camera work is OK.This movie really has nothing going for it at all other than people like trains and end of the world scenarios. Beyond that the plot is something a child might come up with, completely unsupported by any kind of common sense or science this train hurdles onward, through snow, as if somehow the only way to survive cold is in a moving train.For me, something like an underground shelter might make this movie a lot more believable. The idea they are on some magic train piercing through the snow is just stupid. Trains don't actually really just go throw thick snow and why would you have to? Why not take whatever powers the train and just make an underground shelter with it? The movie never really explains why anyone would want to stay on the train in such bad conditions nor why anyone would want all those people on the train since they serve no real use or purpose. The entire poor vs wealthy uprising vibe they have going makes no sense because they don't need the poor people there to run the train, why waste food on them and risk losing control? More importantly though, why perpetually drive a train through snow and constantly risk derailing while trapping yourself in a small space with limited resources. On top of all that there is no way a track would survive a massive climate shift like this. It would be covered or destroyed by such dramatic climate shift as well as face constant avalanches.It's like the movie Speed on a train with a climate apocalypse setting but on a real low budget, without good directing, much worse acting and with a less believable storyline.It should be rated around 3-4, but for some reason this is some weird cult following boosting the rating of this horrible movie. It's much worse than The Colony, which made no sense either, but still made vastly more sense than a perpetual snow train.The only thing it has going for it is that it's so weird and makes so little sense you may keep watching it in hope of closure, which you will not get.",Snowpiercer

I mean - movie had great concept (I loved the design of original comic this movie is based upon and actually enjoyed first trailer when I saw it), but let's face the facts - acting is simply awful, Evans barely can hold his role together, and movie's plot is so predictable and straight forward boring, that nothing, even mediocre cinematography and great interior design of the shots simply can't save it from being failure.I honestly can't believe that only one of the other reviewers here in IMDb have stated, how incredibly overrated this movie is. ""Best movie I've seen in my life"" - seriously? Have this guy have seen ANY other movie EVER to make this kind of statement? What the hell? I gave this movie 4 stars, and ONLY because of work of director of photography and artist who made interior design of the train - everything else - actors, acting, plot and even CGI was so poor that it wasn't even entertaining, even not talking about pulling some strings, as it obviously supposed to do.",Snowpiercer
665,daviddevries,Do everything you can to see this on the big screen!,10,7 July 2014,"There is not much middle ground with this movie, you will either greatly enjoy it, or you won't. Don't nitpick on the plot, the train is a concept and a parable, not a real world solution to a frozen apocalypse. It is not just a big long battle, it is a journey. If you need everything spoon fed to you, this isn't the movie for you. That being said, this is the best all out action movie since The Road Warrior. There is a big dash of Terry Gilliam and Jean-Pierre Jeunet quirkiness through-out the film, which in my opinion, only makes it better, instead of a big long blood-bath, and if you don't like their films, you won't like this either. This is real Sci-Fi with a brain, of the likes we haven't seen for years.Put simply if you: Love Mad Max and The Road Warrior and think Beyond Thunderdome was an abortion; Think 12 Monkeys was Bruce Willis' best film; Are an action fanatic and despise the Transformers films; And have even a remote understanding of Zardoz's plot;You will definitely love this movie.",Snowpiercer

I don't know what kind of people might like this, it's total garbage, it's not good at all. I think that you should avoid watching this crap at all costs, it will literately make you feel bad, because if you like these actors you will feel cheated and abused.

667,invaderxan,...what?,5,9 February 2018,"This movie was... interesting. There were some nice ideas and concepts in there, but ultimately it just made a big mess inside my head. And I'm not going to pick out plot holes because hell, just read any of the other reviews on this page. But combined, they felt a bit distracting.The art and style is great. The whole thing is interestingly designed, and certain motifs like the big W logo come together at the ending when the main plot twist is revealed. Some of the character design may be a little goofy, but it fits with the overall tone. A lot of this movie is very visually attractive and the actors do a good job of keeping the narrative going. The choice of bilingual dialogue is an interesting one too, and not something which is used often enough in cinema, in my opinion.The trouble, the way I see it, is that most of the tropes in this film, dystopian or otherwise, have been handled better in other films.The population is controlled by both the top level and the bottom level being controlled in unison, leading to regular revolts by the lower class which are ultimately doomed to failure while still allowing room for the cycle to continue. That's basically the same premise as the latter two Matrix films.A dystopian society is subdivided into a starving and oppressed lower class who live in abject poverty and a flamboyantly dressed upper class who seemingly do little else but engage in mindless hedonism. That's essentially the worldbuilding from The Hunger Games.Brainwashing people with pseudo-religious propaganda to believe the person in charge is some kind of benevolent and merciful overlord... I can't think of an example offhand but I know I've seen that before.I was honestly surprised when those protein blocks the lower class were eating weren't rebranded soylent green. Though I have to wonder where they got all the roaches from. Were they farming them?All that said, a lot of good plot setups and payoffs are there in the writing. The drug is an explosive, the matches save the day twice, the uncomfortable regularity of characters losing limbs, and so on. Most of the plots and arcs are well constructed and you genuinely do feel empathy for some of the characters, making for some sad moments when they met their ends. The trouble is that the ending felt... Derailing. Pun intended. Giving it a full on Blake's 7 ending made a lot of the movie's main conflict feel a little pointless in hindsight. And why was there a polar bear on top of the mountain? They hunt seals.Additionally the whole thing about Curtis not wanting to lose his arm as a character arc feels a little tacked on TBH. But that's probably what happens when you squeeze most of a character arc into the final act of a story. Also, dammit Chris Evans, what is it with you getting limbs stuck in machinery at the end of movies?Overall, this movie feels more Waterworld than Fury Road, as far as dystopian stories go. It's worth watching as an entertaining and slightly larger than life action movie, as long as you don't pay too much attention to the finer details. But it certainly won't be for everyone.",Snowpiercer

669,jossarian,Average Bad,7,26 May 2015,"This is a bad movie with few things to save, and a lot of missed opportunities. If you are bothered too much by incongruity, plot holes and senseless moments, don't watch it. Might be frustrating.The socio-political criticism and metaphor drives it. The train is the world. Those at the end live in misery and were told thats the best it can be, straight and simple. The megalomaniac leader insists to make everybody live in what he created refusing other ways of life (or plot-hole, not sure) the kids part etc... not so bad. The movie is somehow disconnected and the metaphor only is not enough, there has to be the movie. Good characters and performances of Ed Harris and the half man. Their story makes sense (kinda) and the baby story is compelling. The talk at the end is the best part in my opinion.The Asian dudes, the angry one and the egg one had lots of potential. Also the dudes with axes (bad action).Though the metaphor is good, the deliver is silly and straight- forward. The hero(es) doesn't interact with the train. They're like outside and no one cared about them or their revolution. They're just used to show that 1stclassist had sushi, trees, aquariums and disco. I get it, but not anybody is 12.p.s.: In the last scene everybody dies except for the two kids which are miraculously safe and humanity's last hope ... you close with a freakin' polar bear ...

671,frostyjack,"A fantastic, beautifully directed and clever science fiction movie with a great ensemble cast. Not be missed!",9,3 April 2014,"Bong Joon-Ho's American debut was always going to be an interesting spectacle, both in terms of the graphic novel he was taking the source material from (Le Transperceneige), and from the point of view of how well his particularly niched, culturally embedded South Korean directorial style would transfer to a western audience. Renowned for juxtaposing odd moments of (almost) slapstick humour, and dichotomously transitioning these moments with heavily serious natured themes, there is an accustomed need to comprehend the balance between these — sometimes polar-opposite – and randomly placed emotional aspects for the uninitiated. It is a great touch that demands finesse, but it is far more culturally specific to Joon-Ho's home turf. This is very evident in Bong Joon-Ho's more serious natured and critically acclaimed films such as Memories of Murder and his monster movie The Host (both starring the amazing Song Kang-Ho).So, to cut a long story short–randomly placed slapstick, and a two-hour film might just be too long for somebody who is used to sitting watching a fast paced ninety-minute film. Consequently, Harvey Weinstein's issues about the pacing of Snowpiercer is widely due to the fact that the film is as much a drama as it is an action packed dystopian piece of science fiction. Yes, there is action and suspense–but there is more to the film and the trepidation lies at the presumptions that some western audiences just can't get used to the pacing of these kinds of films. It is typically normal for a South Korean film to come in at the two-hour mark – this can be the troubling aspect of bidding at film festivals based on scripts and snippets of film – just as Harvey Weinstein knows all too well. In a way, Weinstein wanted an action-packed sci-fi rumpus with a narrative text at the beginning and the end to explain the movie in a nutshell. It is the same problem that Ridley Scott had with Blade Runner back in its crazy post-production days when the studio didn't know what it was that they had, never mind how to sell it.Aside from all the political gumph in the background, the film is a triumphant success with beautiful direction and meticulously planned out shots. Boon Joon-Ho has perfected every scene; and there are some remarkably ambivalent scenes that mix both visceral brutality and beautiful melancholy. One scene in particular almost matches Park Chan-Wook's now classic corridor scene in Oldboy in terms of the skillful execution and the intensely choreographed weaponry assault. Needless to say, the film looks great and the cinematography is mesmerisingly captive, going from the grim of the rear carriages to the gradual iridescent vibrancy of the front carriages, as they are explored one-by-one.Topically Bong Joon-Ho offers a microcosmic look at the hierarchical class system that prevails in today's society. Each carriage has an allegorical purpose from the rear of the train to the front; and from start to end what is offered is the small-scale depiction of society from its most basic proletariat level, to the bourgeoisie, right up to the powerful elite; the capitalists if you will; consecutively in that order. Thusly, Bong Joon-Ho takes the viewer on a journey of incrementing injustices, from the simple beginnings of life in terms of the evolution of civilization, science, education, quality of life – to the downfall of living in excess, partaking in needless hedonism as a byproduct of boredom from having it all, leading to squandering extravagance – to the eventual expiration of any morale or purpose of being. The film covers the ubiquitous social stratification that characteristically defines the individual members that comprise 'that' society; organising people by levels, or strata, on a variety of dimensions and essentially synonymising these significations cleverly within each of the carriages on the Snowpiercer.The ensemble cast is simply outstanding with John Hurt, Tilda Swindon, Jamie Bell, Ewen Bremner, Ed Harris and Octavia Spencer all playing integral roles with absolute conviction. However, the most important characters in the film steal the show with Song Kang-ho (who never fails to impress), Ko Ah-sung and Chris Evans all exceptional in their roles. Evans has really upped his game in the acting department and there are some great moments between him and Song Kang-ho in which some of the most pivotal parts in the film are explored with their shared dialogue.Political and economic systems come and go, races are socially constructed and deconstructed, empires rise and fall, cultural traditions evolve and change; but the common factor through all of these myriad expressions of human social organisation is socio-economic class. This cinematic experience allows the viewer to look at – and question – the cultural and social phenomena of the class system. To distill those problems which have constantly plagued civilisations for thousands of years. Some might debate the conclusion of the film, which is indicative of the need to re-watch, pay closer attention and perhaps think of it as more of a means to an end, rather than an end to a means. A fantastic, beautifully directed and clever science fiction movie with a great ensemble cast. Not be missed!",Snowpiercer
672,imdb-849-576493,Felt a bit sick after watching,1,24 August 2014,"Watched the movie on the basis it had some really good reviews. I really don't understand how. It is rare that I have such a strong disagreement with such a high rating on IMDb/Rotten Tomatos.Most of the film was a bloody violence fest with people attacking each other at close quarters with axes, etc. While you hear the bones break and the frequent squelches of sharp things entering bodies thankfully for the most part they cut to the blood spattering against the walls/windows. I have quite a strong stomach for violent films if there is a good story. The bits in-between the fight scenes were short, poorly acted and badly written. The film actually left me feeling a little bit sick given the fairly relentless nature of the violence (Very possibly a first for me).I haven't read the book/graphic novel and suspect much of the story was dropped to make way for the big fights. I am pretty sure the film was supposed to portray how social injustice and revolutions can only lead to a certain outcome. But it got lost. There are also several lines that are quite clearly lifted from the book but not very well backed up in the film so they just sound really corny (You will know what I am talking about if you bother to watch the film).There were several scenes in the film that I assume were supposed to portray the surreal nature of the situation they were in. But these scenes just came across as odd or tedious. I was also rather unimpressed by the film's deviation from made up drugs to do a very thinly disguised advertisement for 'Marlboro Lights' brand cigarettes - I am also quite surprised that that one made it by the advertising standards people intact!",Snowpiercer

The story was unique although it contains elements of Hunger games and the Matrix at some levels. Joon-Ho Bong provided the audience with many captivating scenes. Several unexpected twist in the subtlest of manners. And the ending is left incomplete in a beautifully, such that the movie remains with the viewer long after you watch it. I myself am writing this review weeks after watching the movie. And several outstanding scenes keep flashing in my mind. It is quite gore at some points, Many in the cinema were groaning with disgust. However it was just in the right amounts, I must add.Before this I had not pegged Chris Evans as an actor with a great scope of acting capabilities.

I watch a ton of movies and mostly just for entertainment value. That is all most movies are worth these days. A few hours of entertainment with popcorn to chew on. This movie, however, I wish I had watched with someone else just so I can talk to them about it for hours after it ended. This film takes a picture of so many layers of human life and splits them into cars of a train stuck in the middle of a perpetual locomotive engine that teeters on the edge of near extinction. It is a movie that is everything. An epic tale that will make you think about yourself, about how you fit into society, about all the uprisings and yearnings to be better, to change the world, to be a better man or a woman, to find your place, to fight for your rights, to progress. It will take this all and smack you with the fact how futile the whole effort can be in the end. The acting is basic, but believable. The graphics are not over the top, but they are perfect and tell the story. The cast is from all over the world, which I found unique and quite cool. I really don't want to say much about the story itself, although I found myself thinking it was going to be like Divergent or something similar in the first few scenes. It turned out to be like nothing I have seen before. A unique and well executed story. All the way to the end. I have seen a few other comments here by people saying they don't like the ending, but I believe there was no other ending possible. It is the moral to the story.

To all the reviews criticizing plot holes, I think you're mistaken. The only major plot hole is the sudden warming if weather at the end, which contradicts the freezing of the guys arm in the beginning. Otherwise, everything else is just creativity like a comic book (how can superman fly, zombies exist? That's exactly how this perpetual train exists without maintenance). The acting was decent, it felt like the script was foreign and translated to English, kinda weird but the well establish English/American actors did well to adapt. The characters did lack development and were not really relatable but then again Chris Evans always has that issue. Ed Harris is great playing Ed Harris. The Korean characters need translation, but otherwise a good film debut for the director. On a side note, when was the last time you saw a good movie on a train?

In the very gory full out fight scene late in the film, the insurgents are fighting a full train car of well equipped ninja-like guys, but they win by swinging blindly in a blacked out car? The shooting scene across the gap over a great distance between cars moving in opposite directions with shots hitting the glass right on was ridiculous.I stuck with this all the way to find out how it would end and who and what was in the locomotive only to be dumbfounded that the insurgents, having achieved their goal would throw it all away and initiate an exit from the train that winds up, through unforeseen side effects, erasing humanity.

The train is governed by it's creator and contain what's left on the human race; in fact what's left of life on earth. Life on the train is life in regular society, with ""upper class"" and ""lower class"". as you may have guessed the lower class is less than happy and somewhat envious on the upper class. All boils down to the possibility for a revolution. I am torn about this picture. The story is far from original as I've pointed out but it does have nice touch to it with a few surprises. The performance from the cast is fair enough and John Hurt has a dignity about him that makes him perfect in his role (won't say more).

The premise of the film is something I'd expect a child to draw up in a creative writing class, before reading it back, becoming instantly ashamed that they've written something so stupid and then hiding it from their teacher to avoid being put in a special class. Let's break it down:Originality: None. Basically a childish, ill thought out exaggeration of boring worn out messages about global warming and the 99%. Kinda like Water World.Universe: Just couldn't buy into it. Sci-Fi needs the suspension of disbelief but every scene reminds you that you are watching an awful film. Kinda like Water World.Characters: All dumb caricatures. None of the decisions they made make sense so you lose interest in them quickly. Their personalities flicker around, like the writer just got tired or just forgot about their traits. Kinda like Water World.Action: Immature gory moments, like they're taken straight from a 9 year old's desperate attempt to impress equally childish friends. It's all ridiculous. I kept looking around for hidden cameras, thinking I was being filmed for reaction on some spoof YouTube channel. Kinda like Water World.Acting: The names in this are impressive, but there was nothing they could do to save the film, I just hope they manage to save their careers. Kinda like Water World.To be honest, you may as well watch Water World. I have no idea how that film was panned universally and this film has been praised. This may be passable as a drinking game, but you'll honestly wish you could get your life back.",Snowpiercer

In fact they are long reviews for this forum, But, thus far, no one has comprehensively answered this one question; why in the name of heaven are they on a train??? The world as we know it has come to an end. 99.9% of the population is (apparently) dead and gone. They have an inexhaustible energy supply or so it would seem. So why spend all their time circling the globe on a train? There may actually have been some good acting here I don't know. I couldn't get past the fact that they were on a train that never stopped. Don't they have to stop once in awhile to grease the bearings or something? I don't mind taking a stretch to achieve a setting that is ideal for telling the story the filmmaker wants to tell. But that stretch cant consist of a complete separation from reality. Whatever truth was being presented here, I couldn't get past the ridiculous premise.",Snowpiercer

After reading what the movie is about, a train with the last human survivors on a frozen earth, I was intrigued. Add a relatively high rating of 7/10 to it and it gave me high hopes. Unfortunately the movie doesn't really have a very big backstory to it and it mostly consists of (sometimes close to horrifying) action scenes.Don't get me wrong, but you can sense the work of a Korean director. Which is not a bad thing, but is different than most of us are used to.Although I didn't regret watching this movie, I would not recommend it.

684,oliviamradakovich,Snowpiercer Impressed,8,25 April 2016,"Doomsday films have been around for decades and many have similar story lines that don't create intense feelings within their audience members, and do not get much recognition, usually only categorized into one type. Snowpiercer, directed by Joon Ho Bong, was unlike many films in this sci-fi based genre. Though the story starts 17 years post-ice age, we understand there are a chosen few that have boarded Wilford's amazing train, that has run without problem, for all these years non-stop, even barricading through ice blocks with no trouble. Wilford is the engineer of this train, and the antagonist of the story, with his God-like status among the passengers. The portrayal of social status is important in this film, and it's only shown better and better as the lowest class moves forward through the train. The lower class is finally making its way up the ladder, though by the end of the film there are only two left from the last car. Curtis, played by Chris Evans, is relinquished the task of leading his poverty stricken people to a brighter future, by the death of the true leader, and he fails, though some would consider this a win. This is unlike many films of this particular genre because as Americans, we love a happy ending where our protagonist get to celebrate their victory. The most attractive aspect of the film is the pure grit and grime we see, and continue to discover from beginning to end of the film. The cannibalism is not relatable because our society's thoughts against eating our own, but in the need for survival we understand their actions, though not condoning them. Bong starts off easy, showing the filth they live in, having been born into the lowest social class possible, the injuries, the mistreatment, and as we move forward with them, through the train, we learn more and more. This is a great way to lure in the audience, and near the end we truly understand what they've overcome to reach the head of the train.",Snowpiercer

The effect of the frozen gas goes uncontrolled and the whole world is frozen to the state of no living species is alive except for those species that are living in frozen climate. However, a group of people that are on board on the train survived this calamity. The train portrays a world that categorize people into different classes and their classes define how they are being treated.

I like movies that have rules and internal logic, and the premise of this movie is idiotic from both a scientific and common sense angle. It really works though. Like it really works. If you can just suspend disbelief and accept that a train can run forever and sustain some sort of biodome indefinitely then this movie is a masterpiece.I see reviews where people basically complain about how the premise impossible, or that the themes are cliche, and I'm totally with you guys there.

Where were they going? They could just as well park the train anywhere since nothing outside the train survived. (Save 1 polar bear) There is no point in traveling continuously around the earth they could just as well run the train in a circle on some much safer flat land in the corn belt. The amount of money to pay for an over engineered rail around the world and a 1001 car long self sufficient train would have been more practically utilized in an underground cavern or mine.The train is in fact so pointless that I rate Snowpiercer a decent B- movie that would have benefited from a generous dose of nudity, sex and debauchery in the party section.",Snowpiercer

To me, it seems like the original storyline was that the front of the train keep the pour around in the back of the train so they could eat their children. This seems like the only reason you would keep the poor around, since they did nothing for the train. And the clues I believe this was the original intention are as follows.1) There's no cattle car yet Ed Harris is eating steak. 2) Chris Evans has that whole speech right before he meets Ed Harris about how he hates himself because he knows what human tastes like. Setting up the next scene for when he eats the steak with Ed for they realization of what's going on. 3) There's no reason to keep the people in the back of the Train around because they don't work on the Train.Anyway, if they would have stuck to that I think it would have been a bit stronger.

But it fails on all accounts. And something else - what is the director trying to tell by making all the villains in that movie Caucasians? Am I the only one that is bothered by that?

The truth being that in the case of a successful revolt, the tail would have still had no other option than to put their kids in the gearboxes. Ofc, a better alternative would have been to just gas them or something. But maybe the movie wanted to show the inability of normal people in getting rid of those other problem-people, who only keep dragging everybody down.

700,sl_1138,Depressing. But Not if You're a Polar Bear,1,22 February 2016,"I was excited to see this movie, as a Chris Evans fan, as a sci-fi guy, and even an enjoyer of some dystopian sci-fi as well. I cheered as his character rises in defense of the defenseless. But the farther forward his journey goes to the front of the train, the uglier man becomes literally and figuratively, as he encounters increasingly inhuman- humans. An army of bloodthirsty, hooded, axe-wielding fishmongers? An bodyguard who can take damage better than the Terminator? The pregnant Brainwasher Kindergarten teacher with the uzi? Droves of slow-moving, ambiguously-sexual, costumed crackheads at a rave? What I see here is a deconstruction of what it means to be human. To care. To be vulnerable. To provide family, community, sanity, and purpose. All of these things were present in the filthy boxcar with the lesser-privileged. But as things progress, that is all stripped away, to reveal a population of miserable hedonistic survivalists.But that's not the worst of it. When the hero learns that ""the poor"" have been, for lack of a better term, in cahoots with ""the rich"" the whole time in their efforts to not upset the status quo, he understandably struggles with losing motivation. Even the engineer is really not any more in control than the rest to change things. When challenged with this final conundrum, he ends up deciding to wreck the train, killing everybody on board except for a small boy and a teen girl. The final frames see the two stranded in the frozen landscape, ill-dressed for the snow and certainly lunchmeat, facing a cheery-looking polar bear. Unless the boy is Bear Grylls, then humanity is done.What the writer seems to want to say, through the actions of the ""everyman"" hero character, is that things would be truly better off if we just cut to the chase. And all died now. Because the struggle of civilization is sentenced ultimately as an inevitably-doomed, illegitimate form of survival of the fittest. The animals have a right to survive. But the rich or the poor? Class warfare? Meh. Who cares! We seem to be concerned with the wrong question.Needless to say I was sorely disappointed and more than a little disturbed with this. Human life is condemned as meaningless? The hero's journey and sacrifices are ultimately worthless? I understand what the writer is trying to say. I'm just glad it's not the truth. Now back to my tasty protein bar.",Snowpiercer

This movie offers philosophy and insight about the human condition, touching the soul of the viewer, molded into a statue of fine art by the character development, the dramatization and the fine tuned action sequences never losing it sight on the bigger picture.

The film is simply an attempt to represent modern day society and all the implications involved, including the class system. The film is very confused with numerous plot holes, some of which are absolutely ridiculous and serve no purpose, all they serve to do is distract from the main plot (an incredibly simple plot that is). The majority of these plot holes will have you scratching your head wondering why they bothered to include it, what was the purpose, and who the hell wrote this crap.The scripting is terrible and it's generally a weak performance offered by all actors and actresses. In conclusion the film seemed to have a good concept but fell seriously short. The representation of society and the class system was obvious and uninspiring. This film tried to have a serious undertone, to which they butchered with ridiculous scripting and horrific plot holes.

It might seem limited, the action happening only in a train, but it's not. The idea of an ecosystem inside a running train that goes through the world is brilliant and extremely interesting, it had kept me craving for more and more after each train cart, wishing there were more. The cinematography of the movie is also amazing( the camera work is great) and the philosophy of the movie is thought provoking( left vs right).

706,mario-martinec,One of the best movies of this decade,8,24 March 2014,"WOW! I was really surprised with this movie. It was really interesting and couldn't take my eyes off the screen until the end.It is one of those non-Hollywood movies that even though it had low budget probably used only a few hundred sq.m. of studio set for filming location had a great story and good acting. The most important aspect of this movie is the storyline. For me, the best way to describe this movie is Orwell meets Ayn Rand. Only on the surface, the story is about a dystopian future where people are trying to survive on a perpetual motion train. When you go further into it, you realize that it is about a society as a whole in a microcosm. It represents what's basically a ""pyramid"" of people from rich to poor each playing a role in their lives. As it is outside in real life where rich are at the top and poor at the bottom, in the movie people are segregated in the wagons from the front to the back. The movie uses a lot of symbolism so even though it has a lot of action scenes, it symbolizes things like trying to rise from the back to the front. Also it symbolizes that even though you can organize a revolution, fight and win the game is often fixed and everything that happens was predetermined by higher powers(which is but one way of thinking). The last message of the film for me was that even though you can live your life in a bubble going in a perpetual motion and looking at the outside world thru a window, sometimes you have to stop, take a risk and go outside.",Snowpiercer

709,jaygetpaid,Wasted time if you have more than two brain cells to rub together.,1,26 August 2016,"Let's start simple.No character development, minimal plot, bad story, lots of irrationality.Setting aside the fact that a perpetual motion engine is physically impossible in any and all universes (which is the whole premise of the entire movie; also making the movie fantasy, not science fiction), little that happens makes any sense.It starts off basic and logical enough; the train is where the last of humanity lives and those in the back are the poor and downtrodden. They rise up against their oppressors and manage to have a somewhat successful revolution, making their way to the front of the train.That's when it goes downhill.First there are no bullets, then there are bullets; surprise! We didn't run out! Our guards probably knew that, but they followed our orders to hold empty guns anyway. As they make their way through train cars, highly inefficient cars are seen (such as party cars and hairdressers with perm hair dryers) that would waste immense amounts of resources that would be required for the production of necessities.Second, the leader of the train somehow manufactured an entire machine that can turn a ton of insects (where those insects come from is never explained) into protein cubes (immensely efficient way to get protein and fibre, by the way), but can't manufacture some unnamed part that can be replaced by a small child.Any attempt at a deeper meaning is a miserable failure. This is a survival situation. Humans lived in a survival situation for tens of thousands of years before the modern era. They didn't need some sort of insane balance to survive. Survival scenarios force people to behave more rationally. There's no need for complex social engineering to keep things in line.Finally, the movie ends by killing off the last of humanity, leaving only two survivors. Humanity is destroyed. The only message seems to be that humans are evil and need to be killed off.This is a wasted two hours. There's no deeper meaning (that is portrayed in a rational or logical manner, anyway) and the story makes absolutely zero sense.If I could give it 0, I would.

A blockbuster cast, with a politically motivated story lines up to be a hit. However, the political class motive has been done before, and this adds nothing new. The characters have a lack of depth, their reasons and motives unexplained. The film generally lacks a sense of direction, and feels as if the director wasn't sure whether he wanted to make a comedy or a dark thriller. The film uneasily shifts between comedic scenes and action. And oh my, the action scenes are abysmal. The fight scenes feel low budget and a flashback to old films where you never see someone be struck by a weapon or fist, instead just having everything off screen. The film does pick up slightly towards the end, but with so many plot holes and lack of direction does not make for a gripping watch, provoking the viewer questions, but in all the wrong ways.4/10",Snowpiercer

I did find it strange that the only Korean characters are made to be desperate druggies... although they do end up redeeming themselves in some ways down the road. The main villain(s) as portrayed by Tilda and Ed Harris are indeed captivating; however, the 'good guys' headed by Chris Evans are incredibly dull and undeveloped characters. As they fight their way through the computer-game-like levels of train cars, we the viewer find ourselves wondering why we care about them.

713,GSP_the_Moviegoer,Bong Successfully Makes The Transition to English Without Diluting His Style,9,29 March 2014,"Snowpiercer is a film that can be praised for many things; it's masterful world building, whirlwind pacing, it's lineup of immensely entertaining performances, its pertinent themes; but most of all it should be for its tonal audacity. Once again Korean genre master Bong Jong Ho has fused elements of pulp, pathos, and humor into a refreshing and satisfying combination.Adapted from the graphic novel Le Transperceneige, Snowpiercer tells the tale of a world where Global Warming has forced the few remaining survivors of civilization into a classist autocracy located on a train. When rebel leader Curtis (played with steadiness by Chris Evans) spots a way to finally overtake the guards in the back of the train, a riots starts and all hell breaks loose. Our hero's must journey up the train through layers of classes until finally reaching the leader at the engine.If this sounds like pretty typical dystopia to you let me make it clear that it isn't. While the film deals with a very weight main theme in the form of the quality of life vs it's existence in and of itself, the film is actually very playful. The film never delves into the needlessly self serious tone many blockbuster's and thrillers do nowadays but it also never shoehorns in it's comedic elements either. Bong is a master fusing together different tones and textures; he finds the farcical in the heartbreaking, the moving in the hilarious, catharsis in the smallest of things. Those familiar with Bong's work before, The Host, in particular already know of this genre fusion and it is executed excellently here. All these disparate elements are noticeable but never forced.This playfulness also extends to the action sequences. Brutal and gruesome, but also excellently staged with a clear and precise eye for physical comedy. One moment your wincing, the other chuckling under your breath. This also extends to the film's environment and world which are equal parts beautiful, awful, kind of unnerving, and ultimately rotten to the core. Everything has a nice claustrophobic and ramshackle quality to it and Bong uses the unique environments and premise to his advantage. Some of the set-pieces are truly unique, which are a real rarity these days.The performances also deserve mention, Swinton in particular. Gloriously over the top in every sense of the term Swinton delivers a laugh out loud hilarious villain performance. Equal parts sadistic and frantic every scene with her is pure delight. Another stand out is the short appearance by Allison Pill who is gloriously angelic and insane in the same breath. Evans carries his role with strength and confidence exuding just enough charm and charisma to stay out of generic hero territory. He's not the most intriguing character of the story but he is the most grounded one, which is a scenario as alien as this one is a must for audiences.Another element of the film that should be singled out for praise is the film's deeply humanistic thematic center. It makes the case that humanity shouldn't survive if people have to live like dogs for the sake of living. Life is meaningless without the capability for happiness. The ending (without too many spoilers) is one of the most fist pumpingly heartfelt yet immensely pessimistic images that will be seen this year.The film bolts at a dizzying pace; another one of its remarkable qualities is how efficient it is at establishing the mechanics by which the world operates. Every segment of the train has its own feel and we always get just enough of a taste of a segment to be left wanting more but never tire. This brisk pacing is a welcome change of pace from a lot of modern blockbusters which always feel like they are straining against their bloated run times. The complexity of Snowpiercer's world could justify a three hour run time but instead Bong opts wisely to keep the momentum going so that we never get bogged down in the details.There are a few critiques I can level at the film. Some of the character in the rebel supporting cast don't get much shading. They are all amusing just nothing memorable. Also much like Bong's The Host the production values are wildly uneven. Some of the shots are downright gorgeous whereas a lot of the CGI is very immersion breaking. Bad effects don't usually bother but when they are attached to a a film of such high quality it makes them all the more noticeable. It may have been better if they went fully practical as opposed to meshing in some of the other effects.At any rate while Snowpiercer never reaches the dizzying highs of Memories of Murder and Madeo it is one of the first must see films of 2014 and sits comfortably alongside Minority Report and The Host in terms of providing a thrilling adventure and social commentary.",Snowpiercer

And i can understand where they are coming from, but to me at least the messages that this movie is trying to send and the way they are presented in the film justify the so called ""wtf moments"". Some of the themes that are present in the film are based on modern days political and economic systems,and the impact of religion and our schooling system on society, the film expresses these themes in a really marvelous and suspenseful way.The viewers just need to know what are they in for before they walk in to the theater, because if they come in to this movie expecting to see some cheap pop corn flick with just mindless violence and gore, the movie might fly over them, and potentially surprise them in a bad way.One of the things in this movie that bothered me a little was the casting of Chris Evans, not because i think he is a bad actor far from it, but because whenever i look at him i see Captain America, thats why i think they should have casted someone who is less known, but other than that i can honestly say that the overall acting, directing, and writing is really good, with some awesome stunt work and suspenseful action scenes as well. I highly recommend them to people who want to try something new, because it tells a good original story in an original way.",Snowpiercer

The ending, which I had predicted, was not so much. Open ended. If you have an imagination, you will love the ending, pretty much. The concept and the follow through, was brilliantly done. The elite feeding upon the meek, quintessential the toilet paper that be ruling over those who have nothing. For me? I'd rather die than become some form of entertainment for a stuck up cultist. But that's just me as an individual. What irritates me, is that the individual is LOST and its all 'FOR THE GREATER GOOD.' an aged old saying that originated from the 16th century...I didn't agree with a few philosophical points, I predicted the ending, was disturbed at times, but all in all, this was a good film. Skip the spoilers and just watch, well worth it.",Snowpiercer
717,TheBlokes,"Quirky, odd but nonetheless a breath of fresh air.",8,20 July 2014,"Who knew Captain America could pull of a performance quite like this. Very reminiscent of the 1939 classic 'Metropolis' 'Snowpiercer' is an isolated story set on a train, called Snowpiercer. This movie has seemingly went under the radar but will be known for years to come as a hidden gem, I hope more people see it, it deserves to be experienced. This is the first Joon-ho Bong directed film I've ever watched, but I'll be keeping an eye on his future releases for sure. The writing also needs to be commended, once again it is Joon-ho Bong who deserves the credit among others. 'Snowpiercer' is a completely original take on the bloated post-apocalyptic genre and is a breath of fresh air among the huge summer Blockbusters. It is regrettable that the final act, or more precisely the ending itself falls short of what could have been a masterpiece. The year is 2031, a failed climate change experiment has plummeted the earth into a new ice-age. A Noah's ark-esque high speed locomotive powered by a perpetual-engine, developed by the godlike and elusive Wilford has circled the planet for 17 years. However a class system has emerged resulting in the impoverished working class individuals being located near the rear of the train while the elite and upper-classes live lavishly towards the engine and the front of the train. Curtis (Chris Evans), Gilliam (John Hurt) and Edgar (Jamie Bell) hatch a plan to take the engine, essentially whoever owns the engine owns the train. I will say no more, I went into this movie blind and I hope you will do the same. As I said this is fresh and new but it will unfortunately be lost in the summer movie season. Moreover the movie has a twisted sense of humour, impressive action sequences and a quirky style but somehow stays grounded in reality. Allowing for a seamless blend of the art house and science-fiction genres. Some scenes may have seemed out of place if Bong was not at the helm, thankfully it all contributes greatly to the overall package and doesn't impair the viewing experience. In fact they perfectly highlight the drastic differences between the class systems.Captain America himself Chris Evans gives the performance of his career as Curtis, the leader of the working class revolution. He is physically imposing, intelligent and beneath the surface a psychologically and physically drained individual who essentially has the weight of the world on his shoulders. There is much more to his character than meets the eye. This is a huge departure from his other roles and I only hope he manages to find a way to accommodate these more subtle roles into his schedule. His co-stars and brothers in arms Edgar (Jamie Bell) and Gilliam (John Hurt) do a fantastic job creating an almost family like dynamic. Hurt is undoubtedly Curtis' father figure while Bell is essentially the younger brother Curtis never had. Furthermore, the audience through Curtis are able to build a relationship with their characters. The character of Mason (Tilda Swinton) is extremely quirky allowing for extremely dark, sadistic humour making her virtually unrecognisable. Her scenes forced me to watch uncomfortably as she oppresses and humiliates the working class passengers. Despite it being so cruel and frankly disgusting I was enthralled by her performance, also Alison Pill who plays an overly enthusiastic, eccentric and downright creepy pregnant teacher is fantastic. Additionally certain members of the supporting cast such as Octavia Spencer (Tanya) and Ewen Bremner (Andrew) are serviceable, reinforcing the messages of social satire as their children are taken away for an ambiguous purpose. However I was let down by the Namgoong Minsoo (Kang-ho Song) the tech wizard and Snowpiercer security expert, while well-acted I found his character quite uninteresting and boring. Unfortunately I have to report that it does fall short toward the end, following a heartfelt monologue from Curtis the movie seems to be rushed, attempting but failing at tying things up in a nice bow. Also the reveal of the omnipotent Wilford is underwhelming, which is a shame because the character was set up so well. At a little over two hours the movie does not drag, but instead expertly crafts its characters and manages to stay interesting with a great story, excellent action sequences and quite artsy cinematography. Furthermore in my mind there are two standout scenes, one involving an overabundance of axes and another in a classroom, I will not dare say more in fear of spoiling your viewing but prepare to be blown away for all the wrong reasons. I implore you to give this a watch, take a break from the summer movie blockbusters and treat yourself with this. This is the Korean directors (Joon-ho Bong) first venture into film with the English language, and what an exemplary impression he has made.'Snowpiercer'- 4/5.",Snowpiercer
718,Lane-crew23,Horribe,1,23 August 2014,"There were no well defined characters or poignant philosophies in this overblown gore- fest. The violence was senseless and ceaseless and provided the bulk of this movie. The script absolutely disintegrates towards the end of the movie, especially that implausible and ridiculous line about what supposedly happened in the beginning. Yeah right! Tilda Swinton was great in the role and Ed Harris was superfluous. The set designs were nice, but looked exactly like a set and not anything functional, and this made the entire concept of the train seem fake. What was with the ending?!?

Among the insanity, some parts that stuck out to me were...1) Villain appears out of nowhere, starts a shootout with the hero in another cart 1,000 kilometers away, gets stabbed to death and returns.2) Girl shoots multiple times into a crowd of party-goers. Nobody dies.3) Uh, did he just kill a pregnant teacher? Yes, yes he did.4) They're eating bugs. Good grief. You do realize some people eat bugs in the modern world, right...? No...? 5) Dude who is no older than my father says he's going to die soon and that he needs to pass the control of the engine on to someone else. 6) What is the point of looking after the *eternal* engine, anyways? Do they need to dust it or something? 7) By the way, who are some of these people? Who are those guards with the unnecessary masks and night vision? Do they just stand there all the time awaiting an uprising? Do they ever need to go to the bathroom? 8) Wait, am I missing subtitles here?

722,emmaelaineharvey,Snowpiercer,6,25 April 2016,"Joon Ho Bong's 2013 film Snowpiercer is one that truly represents the upper and lower classic in very dramatic but tasteful ways. There is a weirdness in this film that I cannot describe and I believe that is the true impression a post-apocalyptic film should provide for the audience. Throughout this film, the audience is pulling for Curtis as he is trying to do what anyone who is fed-up in that situation would do. Though it is obvious the train represents social class by where people are placed, the train is also representing how simple yet complicated Curtis' goal is. It seems very possible to just go from one train car to the next in order to reach the highest social class, but there are obstacles that get in Curtis' way. Just like a low income American citizen, Curtis is doing everything they can to get by or to climb their way up to the higher class. Only in this case, Curtis' goal is to take others and himself up to the engine of the train. Looking at the mise-en-scene of Snowpiercer, I could not help but to notice the depressing, industrial, and gloomy setting this film was placed in. Of course the setting isn't going to be placed in a field of butterflies and unicorns, but I think Joon Ho Bong went above and beyond with making the setting feel so real. Anything from the dark colored clothes to the rustic walls to the most-of- the-time dim lighting, these are things that made me feel entrapped along with the characters.Though both films are extremely different from each other, I related Snowpiercer to I Am Legend and The Titanic. For I Am Legend, I actually thought of more differences than similarities though they are both post-apocalyptic films. One major difference is that fact that I Am Legend involves one person's (Will Smith) struggle to survive life after an apocalypse. On the contrary, Snowpiercer involves a whole group of people who are struggling to survive and to also deal with each other. However, The Titanic is similar to Snowpiercer by social class. For example, the lower class was placed at the bottom of the ship whereas the upper class was placed on the top with a full dining room, ballroom, bountiful dinners, etc. Leonardo DiCaprio would be the Curtis in this situation as he tried his best to work his way up to the upper class (with a different intention, of course).",Snowpiercer

732,randall_fire,Everything wrong with Snowpiercer. (it's a lot),4,17 December 2020,"Since there's a lot of reviews of this title, I thought I'd have a bit of fun poking holes in the entire movie. If you're a big fan, best not to read on. If you do, and you don't agree with what I wrote: be an adult please. Shake your head and move on. Also, duh: SPOILERS of the ENTIRE MOVIE and ending!First off: I like the setting. Quite original, even if a perpeteum mobile could never work, like the Eternal Engine. So I won't go into that, as it is the base of the entire movie.None of the characters in this movie are likeable. All of them are drugged up, cannibals, murderers, or just plain crazy. Not ""ha ha"" crazy. Honestly, I only liked Mason since she was so funny in a dry way.That aside, here are major plot holes that ruined it for me:they are feeding a LOT of people with cockroaches every single day. Where do they get millions of cockroaches so fast? Think about it: how many cockroaches in each bar, you think? And they're feeding what, a hundred people every single day like that?after the bridge that signals a new year, there's a long tunnel. All the tailies seemed very surprised by that. But this was the 18th time they passed here, and there were other rebellions before. Shouldn't this be common knowledge, even if there are no windows in the tail? I mean, it LITERALLY happens moments after new year!as they move to the front, they pass a LOT of people who don't seem to even notice them passing. ""Oh hey, a whole bunch of people that look and smell like they haven't had a decent shower in a decade. Must be a mooondaaay!""the gunfight between Curtis the Baby Eater and Psycho McMurderer: suddenly the windows stop bullets? Like magic? And how did they become professional marksmen after 18 years of not holding a gun (in Curtis' case)? Oh, and did you see the two guns? Psycho might be able to shoot that far if he was the best sniper that ever lived, but Curtis' gun? No way.the arm of that guy who threw the shoe is frozen solid in seven minutes. Ergo: the temperature outside is WAY below just freezing. Yet only a mere day later, the girl and the boy can just walk outside, no problem, just a bit nippy...where did they get the specialised snow boots in their size? And the warm coats? Also in their exact size?druggie figures he can see the plane a bit better every year. And so he wants to blow up the entire front of the train? Ok, he's high as a kite, but what logic is there in this? How does he know the exact dose to just blow the door? And if he should be wrong, he just murdered the entire train, the last people on Earth? Wow man, no more coffee (or drugs) for you. Oh look, the other two survivors are gonna help you with your crazy plan!speaking of him, he was in a drawer. Just a drawer, no high- tech stuff anywhere to be seen. Just a plain. Old. Drawer. How is he alive?for 18 years, Earth was so frozen that literally everything died. What did the polar bear eat? It looked old enough to have gone through the entire 18 years. Where did that fricking bear come from??Of course, all that bear has to do now is go for the only two surviving humans on Earth. Yum yum. It's not as if they would have survived longer than a few days anyways. Remember the frozen Earth? No more animals or plants? What would they eat?Waaaiiit a sec. No more plants? Why that means no more atmosphere, doesn't it? What are they breathing? And HOW DID THAT ADULT BEAR SURVIVE THAT?? Okay, let it go, count back from 10...Humanity, at the end of the movie, is dead or dying. The hopeful music is completely out of place. Only two people survived the train crash. They have no air to breathe, nothing to eat, and there's only the two of them so absolutely no way to breed new humans. Inbreeding is a bad thing. Also the children would have 1) no air to breathe and 2) nothing to eat.So, no, the movie sounded interesting but there were SO many things wrong with it that I just didn't like it. Also there are a LOT of dead moments in the movie. It was all a bit jumbled together. Honestly I like the series a lot better since things are better explained and there's this whole ""people are basically assholes"" politics going on.I don't know how this film got such high scores. Everything is well filmed and it looks great, but the story is just jumbled up and they don't think anything through. I'm not even someone who looks for plot holes in everything he watches, I just enjoy the series or movies that I watch.

I wanted to like this movie. The scenery and sets were fantastic, really the best part of the movie. As so many reviewers have done before me, I will number the problems I had with this title (SPOILER ALERT):
1. So all the world's countries agreed to allow magic fairy dust to be sent into the atmosphere to cool the planet down from global warming? Really? Countries can't even agree within their own borders (Brexit, U.S. border wall) let alone between each other (Korean tension, Russian mafia government, Middle East unrest). C'mon.
2. The people in the back caboose are living off of ground up cockroaches for 17 years? And some of them are actually fat? The human diet requires nutrients beyond protein, otherwise we end up with deficiencies (scurvy, malnutrition).
3. People are chopping off their own limbs to feed each other? Honestly this is ludicrous. It would be every man for himself after a while. The Donner party did not self-sacrifice, other than some starving to death for refusing to become cannibals.
4. I get this was some allegory. Was I supposed to understand that fighting to the top of the pile could result in disillusionment when you finally get there? That it is lonely at the top and decisions weigh heavy on the powerful?
5. Why did all of the junkies suddenly get sober enough to fight the two Asian junkies?
6. So father junky was so stoned he could barely open doors in the beginning, and then he turned into super ninja warrior?
7. Genius Ed Harris character build a train that would never die, but could not fix the problem down below that required child slave-labor to fix?
8. Everything needs fuel, everything. A perpetual motion engine that does not require fuel is stupid, unless it is solar or something.
9. Where were the livestock and chickens? What did they live off of? Last time I checked you are not supposed to feed cows with cows or chickens with chickens. Ask a farmer what happens when you do this.
10. The entire premise was based upon planned uprisings to control the train population? Why not just make everyone equal, and carefully control the birth/death rate. Seems like sane people in a desperate situation would agree to this.
Gah, I really could go on and on, but there are just too many problems with the story. If you want to torture yourself for 2 hours, go ahead and find them all yourself. A 7 rating is silly, This is a 1 or 2, 2 being generous. Fortunately for me I found this in the free movies in On Demand. SO glad I did not pay for this experience.",Snowpiercer

But this is fresh because it avoids common cliches, while still including some of that dark satire that we love. The elementary classroom scene is to die for.My one beef is that the protagonist of the movie, Chris Evans, is the tallest white male among his people. Must the leader always be the tallest man?

Divided into economic levels, the marginalized at the end will start a revolution to have control of everything.This being a science fiction film, very current situations are reflected, themes that Bong Joon Ho portrays in all his films, although this is based on a novel, it is understood because the director chose the projectIn Spanish the film is titled ""The Express of Fear"" and may confuse many who imagine the film on the generic theme of supernatural terror. Like what usually exists in Hollywood with those types of titles, and that is why it can disappoint many, because the film is not like that. But terror is present, because the characters live horrible situations, which would drive anyone crazy.Chris Evans as the protagonist is very imposing, a bit illogical for him to be muscled, but his presence is strong as well as his voice that give him character and it is very good the way is portrayed the character. His construction is very good, because he is not an empty character, his way of acting has an antecedent and when you get to the end, you will understand his traumas in a scene that in my opinion is one of the heaviest dialogues in the history of cinema.All the others do a great job, among the most notable Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Tilda Swinton and Kang-Ho Song. That last one is a constant favorite of the director (recent protagonist of parasite) and becomes a secondary character with much to say.The direction is obviously great. For a budget of 40 million dollars they managed to show the film as something very large, epic, and with a quite outstanding production as we are shown different sections of the train.Finally, the ending seemed great to me, a quite logical plot twist, which will make you reflect on the truth about order and chaos.",Snowpiercer

It features scenes so memorable I wanted to watch them again after the credits started rolling, such as a particular fight in the dark, a big fish passed from hand to hand, the reveals, a conversation between two characters before entering the last door, and a duel between the main character and a recurring antagonist from different wagons, and a peculiar, colorful classroom full of children with a pregnant teacher. Cool shots, cool scenes, memorable characters with believable motivations and background, and solid acting. Bong Joon-ho is not only a competent director, but a creative one who knows how to tell a story with style without sacrificing substance.
Some people are criticizing the science behind the movie, and the fact that it was used for a train. Well, Wilford was portrayed a visionary with an obvious passion for trains. Simple as that. It was his project.Now, I will answer some questions asked here.One reviewer on Imdb says: ""The whole concept of a train being the last salvation of mankind on a frozen planet is just beyond belief"".
If you think so, why did you even start watxhing a movie with this concept? It is the physical essence of the whole film. The train as the whole world.""Where does the train stop for servicing to it's undercarriage etc. without any stations?""It is self-sustainable and it can do stuff from the inside. It is not a regular train, obviously. It is the future and everything does not have to be explained. The train is the setting of the story. Do you want more? There is a show now, not sure if it is already airing or about to be. I don't watch shows often so it is just not my thing.""Who maintains the track?""
Again, the movies leaves plenty of space for more world-building. Again, the show.""An engine that runs on magic as much as anything! Why not make it nuclear or at least something believable?""
Because this movie is long enough with its characters and plot and social commentary. If you want hard science on it, this is movie is simply not for you. Nuclear stuff would make it boring. Don't watch a boring movie.""If you were to set up a society in a closed environment why wouldn't everyone have a purpose with controlled breeding rather than be lugging around many people with no contribution to the whole.""
Now you are criticing characters decisions. No way.""Why would you engineer a rebellion to control population? There are many better ways.""
Such as...??? It is a way. The way chosen by the movie.
""The characters are not believable. They belong in the comic it's based on. Nobody has made any effort to translate them to film or realised that some adjustments are even necessary.""The same people who write these things praise ""The Avengers"", ""Black Panther"", ""John Wick"", and the original trilogy of ""Star Wars"".Plot holes?? Some, if you want. Life is full of plot holes. You fill them. This movie is better than ""Joker"". It is better than ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"" and ""The Irishman"", in my opinion. That says a lot.",Snowpiercer
745,dannyh-90614,Great movie with many messages,8,27 May 2020,"I do understand it is nearly impossible to get everyone like a movie.But I just very surprised reading that most users give negative reviews because they criticized logic aspects of the movies that's just either 1. has been explained or 2. just take it for granted man, it's a movie not documentary.So I will try to answer the most complained aspects (hopefully this answer)
1. Why train?
It was explained from the start and you just have to take it for granted (just like you accept how human can create light saber or survive hyperdrive in Star Wars).. Human become so smart and stupid at the same time that they try to cool off the earth (from the global warming they created themselves).. The event happened so suddenly, they got no time to build ship like in 2012 movie or build bunkers that can withstand weather below freezing point. It just so happen this train maniac have built a very long train (that can withstand various weathers and have 'eternal engine') along with the loooooong train tracks that cover many places around the world. He build it just for tourist attraction (and his own satisfaction)2. It is impossible that the train parts survive that long
It is clearly mentioned that the parts need to be changed. After 17 years or so, that parts become extinct (because no one made it anymore), so they finally use children to manually operate/fix it3. If Wilford is genius who able to create eternal engine, why not build the space only fit for children?
He build the train for tourist attraction. He thought he can just stop the train then replace the parts. So no need to prepare room for anyone to manually operate it.4. Who take care of the tracks?
Nobody.. Like has been explained, this train is not made by government or scientist to help humanity survive doomsday. By this point, IMO, humanity can survive that long because they are lucky. You can see in the movie, there were times the train hit huge piles of snows, and the train got a little bit shaken and nearly derailed. So yes, they were lucky the train was still intact for 17 years.5. Why they need the classes? Why the poor just complain and want to rebel when they do nothing?
(This is the most thoughtless complain honestly)
This has been mentioned by Mason. They got their place by their own preordained position. Meaning, the first class passenger are first class before the disaster, before the train life. Maybe they pay or provide something to get into the train (they might pay by providing skills, fish, Cattles? whatever).. The tail end passengers? Freeloaders.. They just got to the train at the last minute. No ticket, nothing to offer. They just jump in.So, if you then ask ""still why not offer to let everyone be equal"", well, the ones who get the first class and economy class will certainly not welcome the idea (I do not have that much faith in humanity). And wilford knows, even if they tried, equality is impossible for a long time, at some point, someone will get fed up by it and try to be more superior, it is just in human nature (that is why communism never works as in the theory, and no China is not yet a 100% communist country as mentioned by Xi Jinping, you can google it yourself). That is why he said order is needed to maintain ""peace""Why they complain and want to riot? Well, this movie try to make you look at how the real world operates in a simplified, fantasized and compressed nature. So yes, in real life, poor people will certainly do riot if they feel cornered in life (meaning they are hungry, fed up with life, etc). Take a look on how this covid 19 situation shows: People with no money, not able to get food, tired of being at home with nothing to do (the rich get wifi to watch movie in smartphone, how about the poor?), many of them do illegal acts, robbery, murder. Prolong it to years, they will certainly rebel.6. The train sections location, where is the section for them to get this and that.
For where is the section for breeding the cattles, to get wine, alcohol, narcs, the insects, etc.. well this is a movie, limited to 2 hour. Do you want to watch the movie explaining 1 by 1 of the 1001 train carts? It will be a boring trilogy. And the location? Many has made the simplified map of the train along with the analysis why it is perfect, you can see it for explanation. But for me, again this was a tourist attraction train. Maybe there were no cattle cart, no garden cart, etc, as they can just stop somewhere are replenish. So if it is not perfect, well, forgive it, they modify this train for humanity survival probably just in days and in panic mode (who knows how long the freezing process happen, maybe if prequel was made, we can understand it better).7. It is just impossible to provide for that many people with just few carts modified to garden, cattle, aquarium, etc..
Well for me A.) You do not know how many in the mid upper class get to eat the sushi, chicken and beef. Maybe only the 1%, the rest eat veggies.
B.) The movie is set at the time when humanity is able to make a cooling agent to cool off the atmosphere, so i am sure when that time come, we are already able to make some things to speed up the harvesting process at least for veggies.8. Whats up with the terminator part
Well, I think, it just to make the movie interesting, so just take it.9. Why wilford let the tail end passengers to starve then suddenly come bringing protein block?
Well, he did not expect any tail end passengers. So maybe, at first he thought to just let them die naturally. Then he changed his mind (or maybe persuaded by Gilliam or maybe he just need time to think what to do) and then made the automatic protein block machine.Well there are more concerns, but it will be too long to answer one by one.Hope if you hate the movie, it is not for the ridiculous answer such as because it is illogical scientifically and not gonna happen in real life because it will not! Not now. If it doesnt work/comply with current science, sure it wont.It is a movie and it is set in imaginative situation. If it happens now, we will die and extinct. That's it.",Snowpiercer
746,Pizzaiolo,"The Mason character immediately reminded me of someone who wanted to be First Lady because it was ""our time""",8,2 November 2014,"The Mason character whined several times about ""you people"". You get food and water from the leaders, get shelter from them and get warmth from them, and still ""you people"" aren't satisfied.Some other Mason lines that reminded me of what Ann Romney would say or think: ""On this train we must maintain order, we must always remain in our stations. We must each of us occupy our preordained particulate position. I am a hat, you are a shoe. I belong on the head, you belong on the foot. In the beginning, order was prescribed by your ticket. First class, economy, and freeloaders like you. Eternal order is prescribed by the sacred engine. All things flow from the sacred engine. All things in their place. All passengers in their section."" She said things similar. ""I belong to the front. You belong to the tail. When the foot seeks the place at the head, the sacred line is crossed. Know your place. Keep your place. Be a shoe."" To me the Mason character also looked like and sounded as crazy as Ayn Rand.Speaking of Ann Romney, the arrogant, elitist leader that she worshiped was named ""Wilford, the divine keeper of the sacred engine."" Or was that ""Willard"", for you-know-who.",Snowpiercer

749,changrukangaroo,"Poorly thought out story, even worse social commentary",1,1 December 2020,"The entire premise of this movie is stupid and everyone knows that. However, some people think that its social commentary excuses its numerous plot holes because the premise was used as a metaphor. The circling train is a metaphor for the cycle of revolution that never actually changes the status quo of a stratified society and those who make it to positions of power inevitably end up helming the system rather than overturning it. As if that wasn't on the nose enough, you get your standard scenes of the rich indulging in extravagance, the poor suffering in extreme misery, and children being indoctrinated. Taken as an allegory, this is as derivative and trashy as any random action blockbuster, only when you watch those you can at least have some fun with it whereas this just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.Just because a movie has social commentary and allegory does not automatically elevate it above one that doesn't. What is the social commentary actually saying? Nothing new that I could personally find. It says that we need to break the cycle, but how? It implies that revolutions don't actually work, which might be true in some cases but clearly revolutions in history, even the failed ones, have massive revocations for a country's direction.The best part has to be when Evans' character gives an angsty monologue about how he almost cannibalized an infant but this monologue doesn't actually have a point to make. Especially since the guy the infant grew up to be got killed just to give him more angst. Unless it's making the point that for all you sacrifice in the revolution, you end up becoming that which you hate and yada yada. Again, to no one's surprise, it's hard to change the status quo.Even with the cliche message, it could have been executed well if it went into realistic detail about power structures, prison-industrial complexes. and the socioeconomic reasons for perpetual poverty, but since its in-world model for society makes no sense whatsoever, any such nuance is absent.Ok, so maybe you can enjoy this movie as an action thriller, ignoring all the plot holes? Partially. It's got some very stylized violence that makes for some good moments here and there, but it also has weightless deaths and the violence crosses the line from fun to disgusting. At one point this one overweight middle aged dude kills off 3 of the main cast that we've been following up to that point in rapid succession, which is both jarring and pointless because those characters were so one note to begin with.",Snowpiercer

It is not meant to be coherent all the time, I am surprised that people would spend time criticising for instance that you can't fire bullets from one side of the train to the other side. Godness gracious, it's a fiction movie, it's not a documentary! No, surrealist movies are not realist, period. That you'd spend so much time focussing on technical details and missing the whole point of the movie, that must be quite an awful experience to go to the movies... :) I love for instance that Joon-ho Bong sometimes gets rid of the translation machine: good on ya! we've got it, we understood that they don't speak the same language, now we can focus on something else.

752,xxxxxxmark,Starts Out Bad and Doesn't Get Better,1,30 August 2014,"This is a film which someone obviously thought was a clever depiction of the human condition. Clearly this story is intended to represent a class/caste system, where people are ""pre-ordained"" to be either at the front of the train (the elite) or the back of the train (the poor). I'm amazed at the number of reviewers who gave this cinematic excrement stellar reviews, not based on the quality of the script, action, or entertainment value, but based on some collectivist/socialist ideology that identifies with the characters' plight. The ultimate irony is that socialist systems are what create this very type of caste system, whereas a free-market system allows even those living in grinding poverty to break the shackles of penury to become as successful as their ambition, wits, work ethic, and perseverance/tenacity will take them. Not only is the basis of this film flawed in its concept, the cast is dull, the plot is boorish, the script mundane not to mention completely implausible, and the ending is utterly predictable if not painful to watch. Do yourself a favor: do not rent this film. In fact, if it's given to you, you would be wise to not accept the film and save yourself 2-hours and six minutes that would be better spent, oh, rearranging your sock drawer.",Snowpiercer

The premise of the movie was an interesting one but scene after scene contained twists that seemed so unnatural and illogical. Why would someone invent a perpetual motion machine and put it in a train that goes around the world during a constant blizzard?? Wouldn't the tracks break down after a while? Does the writer understand that the world cannot be connected by rail because continents are divided by oceans? How can a group of ill equipped and sick people take out a bunch of beefy well armed night vision wearing adonises'? Why would the first class people continue to let their children stay in class, and others enjoy the spa or go to a rave all the while knowing that the poor have revolted and are trekking their way to the front of the train? The movie was absolutely ridiculous and sets a new low in intelligence once held by the movie ""the core.""

But I felt compelled to after watching this and noting the major, numerous gaping holes in this film. WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!1) If this Wilford guy knew this C4 gas or whatever was going to turn the world into an ice- age why didn't he do more than just build this train? He talks about this engine being eternal - so why didn't he use it to power an underground city, with actual space to move?2) Who maintains the train and the tracks? In 18 years no repairs have needed to be made? None whatsoever? In this post apocalyptic ice age there is no damage? I don't think so!3) Why was there no explanation as to how this engine actually works? Literally, no explanation whatsoever. 4) The poor need to be routinely killed by allowing them to uprise so they can be slaughtered? What kind of idea is that. Why not suggest a child policy?5) Why was a class system needed at all on this train. No explanation as to why they couldn't be put to work to be productive members of this ridiculous train society!6) Who were the bad guys who dressed up with night vision goggles? Why were they so ready to kill? Which class were they a part of? Do they have a back story?7) How did the fire reach from the back of the train to the carriage where they were fighting so quickly?8) Why was Tilda swinton who played mason stabbed with a knife in the leg but could walk fine in the next scenes? And why did she randomly take her teeth out? And what were he weird little speeches about?9) There are apparently first class, economy and the freeloader sections if the train? But where were the economy passengers? 10) Where were the animals that produced the meat for the refrigerated meat section and why couldn't you see their breath on there - surely it was cold. 11) Where were the chickens that produced the eggs? Where were the cockroaches coming from that made the protein bars? Oh and where did the rice come from that went with the sushi? 12) They have a dentist, a tailor, a hairdressers, jacuzzi, sauna, bar, a nightclub and a crack den but no nice bedrooms for first class? Where do they sleep? Note there are the bedrooms next to where the protein bars are made but there is no explanation as to who stays there and they were a bit grey and small to be first class accommodation. 13) Where did the kids go that were being taught in the school. Curtis didn't pass any of them again while going through the train. 14) Why did he waste all his bullets trying to shoot the bad guy through windows of the train? How dumb was that?!15) Why did that bad guy live through so much? We literally saw him die. We saw it happen. He was stabbed in the side and died. But all of a sudden he stands up and walks and pulls out the knife no problem and has enough energy to have a full on fight for no apparent reason. 16) Who was the woman in the yellow coat? What was the point of her?17) Why were all the people from the nightclub suddenly wielding axes and chains? Because the two Koreans stole their drugs? Really? Why is everyone so excited to kill on this train that is the last hope for humankind? Why couldn't the girl kill anyone whilst shooting about 8 times into that crowd?18) Why did Wilford want to give up his job as engine commander. He says it's was because he was old but he only looked 50/60. What was so demanding about sitting there that meant he couldn't do it anymore?19) Why did that kid ignore Curtis like he was brainwashed and walk into that weird engine thing that popped out? And what was he doing in the engine thing? And why was he in a cupboard? And why did he come out at that moment? 20) Why did Curtis chop off his arm to save a kid when they were about to blow up the train anyway? Why not use one of the weapons that were around a lot of the film to put in between the gears to take him out? Or not bother at all. 21) Why would they blow up the train? For what reason? What possible good could come from that? Curtis had the power in his hands and he could have made this little bizarre train world a better place, but nope - let's derail the train and kill everyone with an explosion!22) What the hell are that teenage girl and little boy supposed to do now? She just killed everyone on the train and if the cold doesn't kill her and that boy then the polar bear will probably kill them! And again no breath!

I just want to point out the two things here, in the cross-valley train shooting scene with Curtis and the invincible henchman there is no way you are shooting a 9mm Skorpion 200-300m with that kind of accuracy in those weather conditions, or the M4 Carbine for that matter. It's just like...come on. Oh, one more point is the fact that to get from the head of the train to anywhere else you have to walk through a ridiculous rave and a drug pit? Wit mate?

It's one of those movies that creates new classic, original scenes and dialogue for which a film gets remembered for. I'm a grown man and I found myself gripping my jacket in front of my face on numerous occasions due to the alarmingly satisfying moments of brilliant tenseness. Something needs to be said about the low IMDb rating. You'll notice that Snowpiercer boasts a 94% on RT as well as an 83 on Metacritic, yet it holds just a 7.0 here. It's the same reason that Equilibrium held a low rating for many years (and today it has made its way up to a 7.6). The general public tends to have a hard time with original futuristic sci-fi that defies the current boundaries. A similar thing happened with Dark City. But, for any of you who are curious about the 7.0 rating, have no fear; Snowpiercer is a true 8.5 or greater.

A rave is going on with rancid people doing drugs referred to twice in the movie, as being ""Highly flammable"" So yeah next to the engine room (And strangely also a sauna) a rave is going on with people doing potentially flammable drugsExhibit B) Small children are being used to do manual labour on the engine - Why was the engine only built to fit small people? Exhibit C) At one point a bunch of bloody bruised and beaten-up people enter the school car and just about none of the kids have a reaction to thisExhibit D) The low-class people are being fed protein bars made of disgusting bugs - Where are those being manufactured and where are the bugs kept?Frankly, I could go on and on - But, the thing is there is just too many plot-holes and next to no character development And what's worse I had no compassion for any character Amazingly this have a 95% Rotten Tomatoes score, so you might just enjoy this movie thoroughly thoughTake away my bad attitude towards pointless and excessive violence and stupidity, I'm actually a glass-half-full type of woman, so I give it a 3 for its somewhat classic and heroic class-war theme with an utter lack of depth or even sensibility",Snowpiercer
768,markus-s-englund,Mildly entertaining but the premise defies logic,4,22 March 2014,"Mild spoilersIn the future, humans have accidentally turned the earth into a frozen wasteland in a botched attempt to stop global warming. The only survivors live on a train that travels around the globe - a perfectly daft place for surviving the freeze. The movie fails to adequately explain how the train produces the energy to keep it moving, or how enough food could be produced in such a tiny area. In fact, why are they on a train at all? Surely a stationary facility would be much more practical. I could name several more nitpicks, but suffice to say the whole premise makes little sense.The passengers at the tail end of the train live in slum-like conditions and are separated from the passengers at the front end who live a more comfortable life. The train is ruled as an authoritarian police state, using force to suppress the underprivileged people at the back of the train. (This too, doesn't make any sense) The people at the tail decide to revolt. They start fighting their way through the train cars, slowly making their way to the front. This journey offers some OK combat sequences, but at times it feels like a video game as the protagonists progress through the train and encounter ever more dangerous enemies. Luckily the film never gets boring. The bizarre world they encounter towards the front is quite amusing to see.Maybe I'm missing the point of the movie by dissecting the logistics of running a train in a postapocalyptic wasteland. I can see how some of the artfilm crowd would appreciate this film because of themes, symbolism and other abstract nonsense.

Acting weren't that bad but what most disturbed me was the Mason character, she looked stupid plus she reminded me that creepy lady from hunger games. I thought they at least try to make it more realistic as the idea was pretty dumb, why would they put a only existing humans to death on railroad ??? If technology was that advanced why there weren't any bases built or something? Maybe it was because the guy invented infinity power source by himself and wanted to use it on train cause ""he wanted to live in train forever"" as it was said in the commercial. And by coincidence he was only who knew about the global warming coming...? Here's a top 5 of questions about the movie that tortures me;Where did the cockroaches came from? There was like tons of them!Why people didn't fear to die at all?? Even the first class people didn't!!

I had never been overly impressed with Chris Evans' acting skills until watching him in this film. He delivers a raw, emotionally captivating performance that will punch you in the gut. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 is because there are some pretty blatant plot holes and questions that should have been answered to make the film more believable, but in the end, the beauty of this movie definitely outweighs it's flaws.**I am not a movie critic and my only film education is one credit hour in Film History.

Entirely up to your own interpretation... if this film gains a cult following then it will likely be debated for years to come. The biggest question will always be... Is it Right-Wing, Independent or Left-Wing propaganda? I would suggest that it's none of the above.. completely devoid of any ideological stance.. like any great 'Work of Art' that last's for centuries...it's meant to transcend any temporary/personal political agenda or affiliation. I would say it's not propaganda of any type. Instead it focuses on the gritty reality of human existence as a whole. Perhaps mirroring the 'end of the world' fears & preparation shared by so many cultures.

It may have been better if the movie was split in two parts so that one would give the setting more and the latter would have a more intense plot-line.But all that aside, the movie itself is great. It's not an action-flick. However, the themes the movie deals with (primarily of the greed of mankind).

My plan was to present all the major plot holes and unanswered questions here, but after a quick glance at the reviews I noticed that had already been done a lot. So, just some of the favorite things I learned from this movie:*When the world freezes over, the most likely thing to cheat death is a...train? A train with windows which look extremely thin (shown in the shoot-out scene between the main character and the antagonist).*Apart from a few blocks of ice, the track seems to be completely unaffected by the ongoing ice age/blizzard. In most scenes where we can see the track, it is not covered by a single snow flake. *Getting your arm completely frozen and then shattered leaves you otherwise quite unaffected.*100 axe-wielding, night-goggled and fish-gutting maniacs is no match for a starved mob - including children, women and elderly people - equipped with.. practically nothing.*After spending years(?) without sunlight, finally looking through a window and staring at the sun is not a problem.*When 100-200 people fight for their lives, everyone still makes sure to take a pause from the killing to salute the new year. Even the dying guy suddenly shines up and salutes it.*Hitting your target with a submachine gun while traveling on a high- speed train, with an ongoing blizzard outside, is really easy. Also, it is better to shoot through the glass then through the already existing holes.*A train easily houses cockroaches enough to feed hundreds (thousands?) of people for 17 years.*Sick people and babies are OK to eat, but realizing you have been eating cockroaches is devastating.*When you freeze to death (the seven who escaped), it happens so instantly you freeze in your walking pose.*Loosing a limb in this movie is such a minor deal, the main character uses his arm to stop the engine instead of a hundred of other things in the room he could use.*The best way to fix a broken engine, which if it stops could lead to the death of humanity, is to replace the broken parts with kids. Five year olds are very reliable.Oh well. I could go on for ages, but I won't. All plot holes combined with all the weird stuff going on ruined the movie for me. In my opinion this movie is a perfect combination of Hunger Games and Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. Half way through the movie I realized the director is the one who did The Host, so maybe I should have expected it..The Host was at least fun, Snowpiercer is just weird with lots of moments when you don't know weather to be scared, laugh or cry.",Snowpiercer

The theme of Buddhist teachings, which is a very popular religion in South Korea, is very prominent.We all start off very animalistic. We become aware of something bigger than ourselves and start to seek meaning (timing, symbols, friendships) in what we observe. We move through the train (that represents life's path), fighting our way through adversity. All while learning that the things we are taught aren't always true.We enter various stages (train cars). The aquarium (sybolic for depths of the soul/self/abundance) and pass through the meat locker (the rawness of our humanity); through to the cars of affluence and celebration. We come to the end, which is really the beginning. And we struggle with our past, hesitating. All of the people on the train represent different aspects of the self and how we choose the roles that define us.

At least private reviews are significantly less favorable.""Grant a film its premise"" is a long-held view of mine. The premise behind Snowpiercer is so utterly insipid however that I find such impossible.That a train whose ride was ticket and running on conventional rails continues to rocket its way ""around the globe"" for decades becoming the only place containing human or any other high life form during seemingly endless snowfall at sub-arctic temperatures with no maintenance performed on the track and never stopping for any sort of supply is truly ignorant. Any single one of those qualifiers makes it dumb but this is beyond inane.Perhaps the politically correction connection to global warming is the reason professional critics and many others refuse to give it the awful rating it deserves for fear of being labeled ""deniers"". Perhaps it is proof the the world envisioned in ""Idiocracy"" is far closer than I want to believe.I will not trouble the reader with any sort of details and only suggest that watching it is a complete waste of your time.

Quite frankly I wasn't expecting much from a movie about a post-apocalyptic train with a class system but...I was completely blown away. This movie is so much more than that. It's a gripping, suspenseful story filled with terrific acting and subtle jabs of satirical humor. The movie spends very little time on the set-up but instead drops you right into the middle of the action, a couple of generations in to this ""city on a train."" I won't go into much detail in order to avoid spoilers, but let me just say that the far out premise is quickly accepted due to the matter-of-fact way that director Joon-Ho Bong presents the story. Chris Evans is in every scene and he's terrific here as anti-hero Curtis.

785,wolvenstar,A surprising film,7,24 August 2015,"For a film that didn't receive a lot of attention on its release it sure does pack a punch. There's a beautiful attention to detail here, that really brings this end of days environment to life. In fact, it has special effects and CGI to rival that of one of the bigger films that consume our screens today. It's sad that there wasn't a lot of excitement around this film where it so rightly deserved it.Not even the allure of big names, including the likes of Chris Evans, John Hurt and Tilda Swinton, could sway a larger viewing audience. And it has to be said that they are missing out on some top quality acting as a result. The characters are highly believable and easy to connect to as they struggle through this post-apocalyptic world.The story itself plays out beautifully thanks to the talented acting as well. It is, however, a fast paced plot that can be confusing with working out who is who and what exactly is going on. But it does become clear towards the end.Add to that some little twists (quite physically as well as literally), ones that will certainly have audiences gasping briefly at before being thrown back into the chaos, and it's really no wonder why it's so easy to love this somewhat confusing story. These often violent and gory moments easily keep the audience on their toes... not that they're not already with the crazy goings-on.Despite all this though, it's the message of the movie that shines brightest thanks to a stunning combination of acting, special effects, CGI, attention to detail and story telling. That message is that humans are doomed to repeat themselves. This is shown from the class division of the train, reflecting out society today: the poor get pushed to the back and forgotten about whilst the rich thrive. Furthermore, though perhaps a little melodramatic, it seems that this film is trying to portray the fact that this habit of repeating ourselves will lead to our destruction.And who knows? Maybe it will be. But there's one thing that's for certain: this film deserves more credit.",Snowpiercer
786,fivelements,Great Dystopia,9,29 June 2014,"I look at this film as an homage to the visual style of Terry Gilliam (and the film makers tip their hand a bit with a character named Gilliam) mixed with the spirit of 60's-70's dystopian films like Logan's Run and Soylent Green. It's a violent dark film but maintains a subtle comedic or light hearted tone either with strange supporting characters or interesting reveals as the story develops. At least until the very end. The best scifi has relevant social commentary and this one is particularly prescient bringing into stark relief society's class system and the 'reality' that society's power brokers impose on the masses to control it. That kind of message can be pretty heavy handed but the filmmaker stays true to the story he's telling so it's easy to get caught up in the grounded gritty hyper reality of the characters' life struggles. As the story develops, each car in the train reveals new and interesting realities and fantastic visuals. Like a story builds section to section, the train makes an obvious story telling device but it's also great. The Terry Gilliam influence can be seen in various visual effects, set design and the Tilda Swinton character had an undeniable Gilliam quality. The end worked and suited the story but it felt a little like it didn't live up to expectations. The movie has its issues most notably involving the main assassin character. The scene where he has a long distance gun fight with Chris Evans' main character from one train car to another as the train is rounding a curve so the two shooters can see each other across the space created by the curving train feels over the top and unrealistic for the kind of universe the film creates. The assassin then has a second life which always seems gimmicky after you think a character is dead. But overall I thought the characters, the acting the story and the visuals were excellent and made for a great movie.",Snowpiercer
787,DavidHT,A bleak view of the future but also a bleak concept,4,20 July 2014,"I'm sorry to say that I disagree with a vast number of reviewers who gave waxed lyrical about this movie. Personally, this movie was flawed but ambitious movie that had reasonable acting marred by a poor screenplay and mediocre special effects. So what can I say? Well, it's the end of the world stuff again and the future of the world lies with a bunch of people who ride around year after year on a train. The train is organised in classes with the lowest classes towards the rear of the train while the most valuable are placed at the front. It's not a very pleasant vision of the future but that's fine. Life is cruel etc etc. The acting in itself was fine and credit should be given to Chris Evans and Jamie Bell for carrying the limited script. Tilda Swinton also excelled in her performance as a nauseating and callous Yorkshire woman too although in fairness I'm yet to see her in anything where she has been particularly likable. The accent also grates on you after a certain amount of time. But anyway, the movie itself suffers in that the screenplay isn't tight. There are a number of loopholes and quite frankly the overall concept is daft. This isn't helped by distinctively average special effects and a scene that has about as must cheese factor as the ""Architect scene"" from the Matrix Reloaded. All in all it tries too hard to be clever and comes across and ends up feeling like a high budget Syfy channel movie. I do feel sorry for Chris Evans in particular because the movies flaws were not of his making.

788,mymyjenna,Intellectual Thriller for Dumb People,2,5 August 2014,"The characters from Snowpiecer are so uninteresting and two dimensional, that all dramatic death scenes are wasted. The only characters that were slightly interesting were the Koreans, and even then, not really. The train travels around a world of plot holes as deep as the Grand Canyon. Every detail meant to impress the viewer about how grimly segregated this world is, is itself a plot hole or is obviously ripped off from classic movies (and yet failed). No one proofed the script. When one of the characters is announced to be the first to do something, it is clear several other characters did it before him. Even the food they are eating shouldn't be shocking because it's made on the train if there are messages inside and they've been on the train for so long.If they've been on the train for over a decade, then all the useful people would have been taken from the back long ago, aside from the children.

From the very beginning of the movie I started wondering if I was watching the correct movie since it was so critically acclaimed and highly rated on IMDb. It is sloppy and uninteresting. There was no flow, and there was no hook to catch and keep me interested.

The film is a journey from carriage to carriage each containing weird and wonderful thing from farms, nightclubs to a primary school. Most of the carriages see great amounts of violence with little dashes of hope ending in a predictable climatic finish.

Joon-Ho Bong has truly excelled and one to watch in the future. I for one thoroughly enjoyed the movie, Chris Evans and co turned in excellent performances. The plot showed signs of unpolished genius and totally credible in terms of how society interacts between the 'haves' and the 'have not'.If that is Bong's intention - then he's hit the nail on the head. Sure it would seem improbable to have this supertrain hurtling nonstop round the planet without any hiccups but set against any other scenario in a fight for survival, the same social principles will still apply and the hate circuit comes to the fore.",Snowpiercer

I get that the director was probably trying to show hope but the whole movie had been about the subtle balance of life and then they wonder out to a frozen wasteland. 1) The polar bear will probably eat them 2) Without warm, shelter and food we die So basically they escaped and then would probably be dead in 2 days and that's the end of humanity..... There's more holes to pick at (shes a drug addict now without drugs, where did the meat come from, and just how much of a bad idea it was to try to make him take over) but I can't to arsed going into all of that now.

The big problem with the movie is that the story simply does not make sense. I won't mention any specifics because I don't want to give away any spoilers, but they are easy enough to spot.Maybe Joon-ho Bong is too constrained by the original French comic from which this movie is based on, but I think the film would have work better if the movie didn't take itself so seriously. The story is just too absurd to be made into such a grim movie. Something more farcical, more surreal may have worked better. The material may have worked in the hand of a director such as Terry Gilliams, who can handle this type material with aplomb.",Snowpiercer

While this film captures the idea from the graphic novel Le Transperceneige, director Joon Ho Bong incorporated high artistic camera work that is beyond entertaining. Considering Snowpiercer was filmed in seventy-two days, the shots involve careful attention to detail from people fighting for their lives on the train. Joon Ho Bong sets this film to be full of anxiety as to what happens next to the only survivors in the world who are alive on this train. The reactions from the characters in this film are beautifully shot was extreme close-ups and as the camera dolly's out one waits with anticipation for what will happen. While watching this film there we are forced to pay close attention as the camera shows slow motion in fighting scenes to see the brutal battle between classes of people. From low angles, to tilts capturing the rush of characters fighting their way for survival on the train, Joon Ho Bong leaves the audience to remember powerful scenes. The sound editing along with the slow motion camera work takes the feeling of suspense to another level and will make you feel anxious. Snowpiercer is an action packed film that should not be missed and seen for the true art Joon Ho Bong created.",Snowpiercer
800,segeorge-12077,Where do you belong on the train?,10,23 April 2016,"In 2013, Bong Joon-ho directed a film that received universal acclaim for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Snowpiercer is an action, drama, and science-fiction film that introduces viewers to a world where the lines between good and evil are blurred. Chris Evans portrays Curtis, the tail section passenger determined to reach the front of the train. Jamie Bell plays Edgar, a young man who worships Curtis, but never seems to be able to impress him. As the film progresses, Curtis is able to form a plan that gets tail section dwellers to the front section. As the audience goes on this journey with Curtis, we see his horror, as he realizes that the insects on the train are being used for the protein blocks being fed to the tail section passengers. We feel his hope, as he releases Nam and his daughter Yona from the prison car to open the security doors along the train. We know his shock, as the security doors open and an ambush is waiting for them. We experience his anguish, as Curtis sacrifices Edgar in order to capture Mason. The devastation in Edgar's eyes as he realizes what really matters to Curtis, causes us to wonder why the ""leader"" of the tail section has such a single minded focus. Bong uses small sets to enhance the feeling of being cramped, enclosed, without escape. There is a drastic difference between the living quarters of the tail passengers and the amenities available for the front section passengers. Bong allows the audience to experience the indignity of life at the back of the train, then brings us through the cars as life on the train progressively improves. From a simple shower to a steak dinner, Bong uses each detail in Snowpiercer to elicit a specific reaction from the audience, causing us to reflect on our present society and makes us ask the question; where do we belong on the train?",Snowpiercer

Those at the back of the train rebel to get to the front of train to fight the man.,7,27 April 2016,"Post apocalyptic ﻿movies have become quite the phenomenon over the last few years. Out of all of them, Snowpiecer is a favorite. It is the type of movie that surprises you because of the slow start. Like most post apocalyptic movies, there is an overall concept of class systems and how even in the apocalypse there will always be someone of an higher power, the middle class, and the poor. These different classes were split up into different section. The poor were referred to the ""last cart."" The closer you got to the train, the audience gets a look at how the life style of each cart gets better and better. Unlike other post apocalyptic movies, this movie used humor in an awesome way. The topic itself can pretty heavy. The back of the train, or the poor, are treated so horribly and there is so much violence throughout that film that when there were funny moments, the audience doesn't know if it was appropriate to laugh. Another great aspect of this movie is the action. It is so thrilling. The movie does good job of introducing a character and making you care for those characters that when a character died, it would hit you hard, making you emotionally involved in the film. The protagonist, Curtis goes on a journey like no other to the front of the train to take down the higher power. It is a wonderful action pact movie that will catch you by surprised.",Snowpiercer

Leading the entire world to completely freeze over and most of life die off. The ""Lucky ones"" were able to board the Snowpiercer, which is a traveling train. Bong has interesting twists throughout the film as we see an entire class system emerge. The train works from the bottom all the way to the top. We see the struggle the lowest class goes through to work their way to the top. Bong, who was able to let us see every class on the train. From the parties and rich all the way to the passengers treated like dogs. This sci- fi masterpiece shows that the last of humanity can either get put in a great spot or bad. It does not show how/why they are where they are. All classes of life are accounted for, we see the lowest of the low take criticism and basically torture. They attempt to move car by car to get themselves out of their situation. Curtis is their leader as he does what he can to stop the treatment him and his crew mates are receiving. Curtis was very creative in the way he went about moving himself and the others up the train. Typically in sci-fi films we see a lot of futuristic ideas and the train was something from another world. This train able to travel around the world multiple times with one man (Wilford.) This train can also be classified as a robot as it basically runs itself. Bong has created a sci-fi classic that will probably be a popular movie many years from now.",Snowpiercer
803,endikajtezovic,Snowpiercer Takes On Our Societal Problems,9,24 April 2016,"You know what I hate about myself? I know what people taste like. I know babies taste the best."" Few films who feature quotes like this can cause audiences to question our audiences. Snowpiercer by Bong Joon-ho is a film that uses it's unique story line to show an overlaying message about our society.The film is an allegorical piece as it shows our society as a whole, it shows the linear movement of the people at the back of the plane and their view of each section of the train. For instance the back of the train is the lower class, they are just fighting to survive with the lack of food or opportunities; the back of the train then revolts and begins it's descent into the lives of the middle and upper classes of the train. They experience the working class of the train(sushi chef and gardeners) which are completely oblivious of the upper classes wrong doing or anything because they are living well and safe. As the back of the train group progresses they witness a very alarming site and that is the class room where they see the youth of the train consuming the propaganda that is laid out by Wilford their leader; the children that reside in the class room are all very prejudice to the back of the train group and give off a cult vibe towards Wilford. Then the train witnesses the front of the train and the sadness and drug use that is exhibited in the front which shows that the front and back aren't much different in this regard. The train itself is linear because the ideas and rules are very linear and safe and really depict our society; while the outside of the train is the opposite it's the opposition to the generic lifestyle of our society. The outside of the train symbolizes free thinking and just like in our own world, governments don't allow free thinking in some cultures and is perfectly shown in this film through its unique story line and great use of allegorical story telling.",Snowpiercer

805,dumpthatstuffhere,Low Ten Worst Films of All Time,1,30 April 2018,"Let me explain. In case you haven't figured it out yet, the reason that so many critics have given this movie such a spectacular review is because all movie critics, well... It's probably not fair to say ""all"", the majority must have been born under the same sign, or have studied journalism reading the same books, and have long since forgotten how to think for themselves, or have an original thought. You see... All critics are conditioned to look for and promote something that they have never seen before, something ""original."" That is their core conditioned value system. If they see something that they have never seen before, that they think is unique, then... THAT is what translates into the highest score. They don't stop to genuinely, or generally ask themselves if they liked what they saw, or if it's entertaining. Why? Because they are conditioned to believe that after tens of thousands of films and television, a story arc can no longer be unique, or original. Thus, when something comes along that has the appearance of being original, absent predictability, then... they (the professional journalists that call themselves critics) wet their pants with anticipation. In this way, their uniform value of what appears to be original, is what makes them (the critics) unoriginal.This is a terrible film. Terrible! Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. It's not even entertaining, it's just stupid. I would almost encourage people to watch it so that they could have a birds eye view into the subculture of our critics. Should someone take a moment to actually read this review, in order to give my review a little depth, here are a few films that I think are spectacular, and would give them the same or higher score that the critics gave snowpiercer. Gladiator, Spotlight, Sense and Sensibilities, Godfather, Forrest Gump... Just FYI, the same metacritics that gave snowpiercer an 88 , gave gladiator a 67.

813,mrcoletti-88000,Don't listen to the negative reviews,8,4 May 2019,"Every negative review I've seen on this website has to do with the authenticity of the film, and how unlikely it is for a story like this to take place in the real world. Apparently, everyone who wrote a negative review has a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and can time-travel, as well as somehow knowing that in 2031 (the year this film takes place), we will definitely NOT have the proper tools or technology to build a self-sustaining train in perpetual motion. And while they're questioning the verisimilitude of this film and the likelihood of these events, they're completely missing the entire point.Sure, I agree that this film has plot holes (including mistakes made by Bong Joon-Ho himself, i.e. when Curtis states that all 3 doors open for only 4 seconds, yet the doors were open for more than 30 seconds when the plan was in motion). But those people who condemn this film for posing a theoretical ""what-if,"" and state all the pragmatic functions which would render the whole film obsolete, should probably refrain from watching anything from the Science Fiction/Fantasy genre in the future. It's clearly not for them.These people who raise their standards just so they can needlessly criticize a film for being too unrealistic are the very same people who lower their standards before they walk into the theater to watch an Avengers movie, or question the realism of Harry Potter because Hogwarts and wizardry don't actually exist, (and they CERTAINLY wouldn't be apt for commingling). Don't listen to those people... They have no idea what they're talking about and overly criticize things just to call themselves critics because, well, it makes them sound smart.Joon-Ho utilizes a plethora of inspirations to craft an ambitious Science Fiction film that is wholly novel and unique, as well as posing thought-provoking philosophical/sociological questions that are highly interpretive and sometimes not meant to be answered (I repeat: NOT meant to be answered). There are certain elements of it that could've been better, such as more character/relationship development, as well as certain story beats this film could've done without... But, there's no such thing as a flawless film no matter what people may argue, and for a flawed film, it absolutely delivers in every department, including the writing.",Snowpiercer

Looks at this film once fully produced and goes yeah I think its alright. It has more holes in it then Swiss cheese. Poorly executed. It's a fantastic idea, and it had so much potential, it really could of been incredible if more attention was paid to the script and visual keys, maybe get some real SFX masters on this one because they clearly don't know the difference between fresh blood and coagulated blood. Don't just put dirt on Chris in one scene then have it gone in the next. The film is so flippant one minute it feels like a true hard hitting action movie then it's a cult then it's the hunger games and finally we end with a knockoff saw. I have so many questions and the film does nothing to answer them. Instead they give us Chris delivering a back story with more obvious clues, dora the explorer could of pieced together.

Mini plot holes like the immense amount of cockroaches were a problem but they are barely shown causing me to really not care that much.The character development with the main character is absolutely wonderful BUT, this is where the character development comes into a problem with the story. The ending hits you with a BIG woah, and I begin supporting the antagonist but then the character finishes his story arc by losing his arm and dooming humanity. If he had agreed with the antagonist, and sent him to the back to watch over the others then it would've been a much more beautiful story.

818,w-02273,Polar Express In Hell,8,3 June 2019,"Not often does Hollywood produce high quality large scale science fiction originals like Snowpiercer, the film written and directed by Korean director Bong Joon Ho gives a fresh breath into the world of action movies. While Snowpiercer does house explosions and typical action movie tropes it isn't what holds the movie up, it is much more unique experience.
The year is 2031, the entire world is frozen over due to an overkill attempt at combating global warming, and in this post apocalyptic earth humanity is stuck on a never ending train ride in order to escape the tundra. The train, set up like an extreme 3 level caste system of First Class, Economy, and the tail end of the train. The back of the train is where we meet our protagonist of the film Curtis (Chris Evans), The movie begins with Curtis and Edgar (Jamie Bell) listening to the words of a funny looking british women (Tilda Swinton) in a very ""Hunger Games""-esque speech where she talks about the benevolence of herself and the trains tyrant, Wilford, to the ""freeloaders"" of the train who did not pay to get on when this ice age first ensued.
The Movie cuts to the chase pretty quickly with the neo marxist rebellion against the elite at the front of the train who live lavishly led by the trains inventor and cult leader Wilford (Ed Harris), happening quite quickly after the film appropriately lays down the dystopian setting.
Watching the rebellion continuously move through the increasingly elaborate train cars, moving from dirty factory to sushi restaurant, in their march to topple the bourgeoisie is incredibly satisfying. The action scenes are well thought out and also savagely brutal, all fights done within the small width of a train. Many action movies like the 007 series have train fight scenes, this is a much more elaborate and cruel version of . A full out war somehow pulled off all inside of a train, all credits are given to Bong Joon Ho for this incredible accomplishment.
The unforgivingness of the situation the characters are in isn't hindered by the fact it's only a 2 hour movie, Bong Joon Ho doesn't pull punches with the grueling nature of the situation. Going into this film i'd recommend you not to choose a character you hope has a happy ending, because even though it's small scale the characters are still fighting a war and Bong Joon Ho isn't the type of director to lessen the harshities of something like a violent caste system rebellion.
Chris Evans is very accustomed to the leading role of Captain America, and he fits his revolutionary role perfectly. The two Korean actors from Bong Joon Ho's previous film ""The Host"" Song Kang-ho and Go Ah-sung fit their roles of non english speaking, drug addicted, and helpers of the rebellion perfectly as well. My only qualm with this film is that the action and story leaves little room for character development and character setting. A prime example of this is that Go Ah-sung's character is seemingly a psychic and that part of the film isn't well emphasized or explained, her psychic abilities are half baked.
Snowpiercer isn't the perfect film and definitely has its shortcomings, but nonetheless it's a very unique experience and a movie that everyone should bear witness to.",Snowpiercer

This is Bong Joon-Ho's first film to direct a film using foreign-language and foreign actors. But the film shows none of this language-barrier is an obstacle to him.

This film follows a post-apocalyptic society that is encapsulated in this train that circles around the globe on a never-ending track via a perpetual-motion engine. But this film is just another allegory for capitalism. Lower class people are kept in the back of the train, they're fed cockroaches they're basically herded around like cattle and as you move forward through the train though people become higher and higher class and they get more resources and at the very front there is the conductor who is the original inventor of the train.
So this film follows this rebellion of the lower class people as they travel up through all the train carts and try to take over the captains cabin.
My favourite part of the film is the pacing and how each little cart in the train is like this new world that they unlock it's like playing a Mario video game or something like each cart is a new level with a new theme to it.
Snowpiercer is still a thrilling, intriguing, blackly humorous and sometimes horrifying ride through the best and worst that humanity has to offer.",Snowpiercer

Someone mentioned that female characters were displayed relatively well and without existing solely for the male gaze, but I honestly think female characters had pretty minor roles, so maybe that's another reason I found the film hard to connect to.

All the passengers of this train cooperate to keep it running. Which is a perfect analogy for functionalism that sees society as a living organism where all of its members play a role to keep it working. Besides, it is shown how the dominant class uses education to teach people that the train is the only way to survive and the police force to eliminate whoever tries to change the system.

835,emersonflohr,"Great film, really surprised by the negative here.",8,19 December 2020,"This was a great film. Not perfect by any means, the ending for one could have been better, but definitely a great, gritty sci-fi action flick. I would pin this somewhere between district 9 and Elysium in terms of quality, with D9 being the better film of course.Yes, the train is unrealistic, wow I get it. People are really upset about the whole train thing. Yes it is an almost impossible premise, but this is sci-fi what did you expect? Very little sci-fi produced today makes any attempt to be rooted in science. Why did everyone decide to draw the line on this film specifically? Must be a ton of train aficionados here.Plus, the premise is fascinating enough to play along for awhile. Mankind attempts to reverse global warming and overcorrect causing a new ice age. The action and pace of the film is relentless, plus the visuals are on another level. The writing was good but the action/visuals really carry the film. The fish scene/fight was legendary, as was traversing all of the train cars and seeing how the rest of humanity lives and the caste systems. Clearly the film has a lot to say about human social hierarchies, if you are upset about the train thing just enjoy the social commentary instead. Again, what is there not to like here?",Snowpiercer

837,jlstark-21006,Good Directors gone bad,1,9 April 2021,"I hate it when a good director takes the money and runs. Like Guillermo del Toro who did great films like ""Hellboy: and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and then does absolute trash like ""Pacific Rim"". In the latter movie he basically turned it over to the CGI guys and disappeared. That was the worst movie I ever experienced until ""Snowpiercer"", another film by a respected director who took a screenplay written by committee, turned it over to another committee of CGI guys and then occasionally showed up to stir the mess.Will there never be an end to zombie characters in a movie that is not about zombies? Having to kill a character multiple times gets really tiresome. In this case it was like Bong Joon-ho said ""that bad guy who got killed was really badass, bring him back"". This ain't a zombie movie, why does a zombie show up?Hard to say what part of the movie was the worst. The plot? Dystpoiamesso. The acting? Over the top would have been a vast improvement.

The director's use of numerous allegories not only adds that little ""oomph"" to the film but it puts your mind in a thrilling roller-coaster ride, leaving you constantly pondering about the meaning of 'justice' and its respective costs. Snowpiercer provides a great enjoyment that pierces through your mind and imaginations. Big applause to Director Bong and his crews in delivering such thought provoking, breathtaking enjoyment.

This is a journey set in a train in post-apocalyptic world. Damn what a shocking-beautiful story about human kind and told in this poetic way. There is so many details that go unnoticed but are so sweet or so horrific through the film. BTW the two goons from tilda swintons crew were a couple, check it (nice touch).

Even though Orwell wrote his allegories quite straightforward they are convoluted being comparison to this ham fisted whackwork.I wanted to like it, but I can't. Neither will you.

844,bcairns,Every single negative review is taking the movie too literally,10,23 December 2014,"I felt the need to write this, after reading so many reviews complaining about ""plot holes"" and the general plausibility of the premise.If you think this movie is interested in exploring how humans could realistically live together on a literal train, I'm afraid you have missed the entire point of the movie.The entire movie is a metaphor for our modern capitalistic society. That's not just an interpretation, the director has stated so clearly. (Look for the interview of Bong Joon Ho by David Gregory Lawson on the FilmComment website)We are all on that train right now. The ""magic engine"" is the economy, that we are all taught is this infallible thing that will run forever. But is it? Will it? Is there another way besides capitalism, or will abandoning it mean ""we all freeze and die""?Everything in the movie makes sense once you understand this. People are literally sacrificing an arm and a leg to serve the economy. Children literally become cogs in the machine. And every revolution that leaves the same underlying system in place is simply doomed to repeat history, ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss"". Curtis finally realizes this and decides to bring the entire system down instead of just taking over, in an ending that is analogous to Fight Club's... tear it all down and hit the reset button.So many ""complaints"" in others' reviews are easily answered once you view the film in this light. For example:Why is the train divided into classes? Well... why is the world?Why can't they just have birth-control to limit the population? How well has that worked in the real world? Population growth continues unabated, and we still fight each other over limited resources.The crazy Terminator dude shooting at the party around that huge curve was evocative of ""the snake eating its own tail""; illustrating futility and irrational self-destructiveness, driven by emotion. (If you missed it, Terminator is driven into an insane rage by the death of his male lover at the hands of the Koreans.)Why not use the engine to power a much safer city, instead of this ""hanging by a thread"" train hurtling blindly along? Because that wouldn't fit the metaphor!The film is not ""an action movie set on a train"", and you owe yourself a second viewing if that was your initial impression. It is a deeply layered allegory of our modern world... and a masterpiece of high-concept filmmaking.",Snowpiercer
845,Ammarsaqib,Perfect combination of south Korean dark creativity and Hollywood's love of drama,9,13 August 2014,"Even in the dark confines of the ark, Joon Ho Bong has made this movie as large as life, it gives a battlestar galactica feel but with much darker plot, the influence of Chan Wook park is evident in the some gut wrenching story telling and some truly head turning twists. but the most surprising aspect is the action, although the movie isn't ripe with it but whatever is shown is of very high qualityChris Evans gives his best performance to date and Kang Ho Song continues his high standards.highly recommended for any one who is a fan of sci-fi dystopian flicks. looking forward to more collaborations between best of the east with the west",Snowpiercer
846,greg-kraigher,The Worst Movie I have ever seen,1,4 November 2014,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Nothing about it is believable, nothing about it makes sense. It tries to explain the meaning of life by creating an apocalyptic nightmare, on a train, with unnecessary action, senseless characters, and even worse dialog. There is a line in the movie about how baby flesh is the tastiest of all human flesh. This line is spoken by the main character during the climax of figuring out his identity. How this movie got made is beyond me. How this movie has real stars in it blows my mind.This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and yes I have watched Salo (or the 120 Days of Sodom) in it's entirety. This is worse, on every level.This movie is literally about nothing. And in the end of the movie, there is no resolution. The characters are killed off faster than a games of thrones episode, and I have no empathy when any of it happens. The only thing apocalyptic about this movie is the fact that it is devoid of all emotion whatsoever. I hope the robots enjoy watching it when humanity is extinct, and laugh about how inferior our race was. It seriously makes me question the entire collective intelligence of the human race and makes me wish we were extinct. IT IS THAT BAD. Avoid at all costs.",Snowpiercer
847,paul-d-thomson,Much better than expected - pay no attention to the haters,8,29 March 2014,"I've been using IMDb for several years and have chosen this film for my first review. I thought this film was edgy, creative and spoke to the very fabric of the human condition. The film focuses on a train which utilizes a perpetual engine in order to keep running despite the fact that the entire human race has been wiped out due to cataclysmic event related to climate change. While their situation regarding a train that seemingly travels around the world unhindered by a frozen world is highly unlikely I don't think that's necessarily relevant because the performance of the characters, especially Tilda Swinton was brilliant. What I was surprised about is that this film received very little publicity. I'm assuming it wasn't cheap to make given the cast and how polished the CGI was so I'm not sure why there was not more investment in Advertising and Publicity. If you're a fan of Sci Fi please watch this highly underrated film.",Snowpiercer
848,joeyp73,A messy attempt at a decent premise.,4,30 June 2014,"I am honestly surprised at a lot of the reviews of this film. I watched this based on the critics and users reviews and was looking forward to it. I finished it (barely) and then cam back here to re-read some of the reviews. My suspicion is that the distributors have paid a whole bunch of people to write nice things about Snowpiercer. I am very willing to suspend my disbelief in the sci-fi genre. In fact it's generally required. What I'm not willing to do is suspend my requirement of a decent script and editing. This was almost cartoonish in its attempt to cover a serious topic. The dialogue left me shaking my head, some of the performances were funny (without meaning to be) and I can only assume the editor had taken some time off to find himself.This movie experience honestly makes me wonder how much notice of IMDb reviews. I usually find them pretty close to the mark but not with Snowpiercer. A shambles.",Snowpiercer

Obvious anime influence that adds an edge only a director from a country with strong anime and manga influence can have. I hope he gets a good appeal with the western cultures, I would love to see the imagination and depth of anime/manga come to the big screen! Overall I had a very good experience watching this movie. It felt new to me, a style of movie that I had personally never seen before. With its obvious appeal to the human sentimentality that ""we can overcome anything together,"" including a stern and oppressive class system or even language and cultural barriers, anyone with an open mind should enjoy this movie!",Snowpiercer

In the last five minutes of the movie, one of the main secondary characters gets matches from Captain America (aka: Curtis the main hero). She sets off a bomb that opens the side door on the engine. The explosion causes an avalanche in the surrounding mountains that wrecks the train. Pretty much everybody but a seventeen year old drug addict and a five year old boy are presumably dead or critically injured. This occurs in an area of mountains surrounded by snow and no long-term way to survive.Humanity dies in the end.No, no BS theories. Those that survived the crash would simply be dead of exposure in a couple of days at best. It also completely nullifies all the events, conversations, struggles (metaphors, allegories, themes, blah, blah) that came before.

851,captkeebz,An R movie written for kids.,4,25 October 2014,"I rented this based on the high reviews from both critics and users, but was sorely disappointed. This film is a mess of overused tropes, character types, scenes, and shots. Several of the actors, including Evans, do well with what they were given, but other characters are far over-exaggerated to the point of ridiculousness. The story gives us nothing new and, like everything else in the film, the writing is a mess of extremes that comes across as disjointed and trying too hard to invoke standard emotional responses. There is a feeling that the writers and director don't understand human nature, or simply weren't attempting to portray it in the slightest. The film was well shot and had many visually appealing parts, but not near enough to distract me from the rest of the calamity.",Snowpiercer
852,dnbmideast,Shockingly bad,2,27 July 2014,"I'm amazed as I scan through previous reviews and see praise for the ""acting"" in this movie. Whilst the performances from the main cast are barely passable as acting it would appear that they blew the entire casting budget on Chris Evan's as it seems like the extras were cast from the local pub during happy hour. The guards on the train were just as plastic as you can get which immediately turns your focus to the quality of the acting as opposed to the plot and this just makes the whole film un-watchable. That's my first gripe, the other is the concept that someone's idea of saving mankind when faced with what is essentially another ice age is to stick what is left of the human race, on a train?? Not just any old train, one that never stops moving??!! Yes, I get the whole confined space idea that brings a bigger sense of separation between the classes but surely, keeping credibility in mind, there are better contingency plans than this in place should the human race ever face such a harsh predicament? I won't go any further than this as I could not bring myself to watch any more than twenty minutes of this movie.

I like being told a story...plain and simple. Whether it is the true story of the Apollo 13 astronauts or the very untrue story of an old man and teenager who travel through time in a Delorean.
This movie was really well told. I was hooked into it from start to finish. Sure there are plot holes...but if you can't just sit down and enjoy a story...what's the point.
So for the non snobs.If you like movies like Children of Men, Sunshine, the Road, Mad Max...you know...weird futuristic post apocalyptic stuff?

I could even get on board the idea of an post apocalyptic frozen world with the remaining society living on a perpetual motion machine. But the plot holes and inconsistencies are so much, that takes away your attention of the history they are trying to tell. To say without given up too much about, many scenes seem to disregard somethings that happened few minutes earlier. And even the characters are, many times, very inconsistent about their reactions and ideas.Looks to me like a script that had potential, but lost it somewhere.After all, I think it's a well made film, if you don't mind the constant question mark face it going to leave on you.",Snowpiercer
856,Rci-739-658932,Much worse than expected,2,14 July 2014,"Due to the reviews... I was eager to see something worth my time.This film will probably appeal to those that like a little action, but don't want to think too hard.The premise is simply ridiculous. It gets worse from there. Reasonably good acting, to build characters that are rather two dimensional is such a waste. A disaster/survival film with a little sci-fi window dressing doesn't even come close to telling a story. It's a good representative of the forgettable modern film, having few redeemable qualities.Counter culture types and those that prefer ""artsy"" over substantive will applaud the film for not telling a story in a strictly traditional way, but frankly, there is nothing new about that. A lot of effort went into ""atmosphere"", and achieving a ""look"", and that's all well and good, but a real story has to be in there somewhere.There is only the slightest feeling that anyone in the film is really human at all... and while the ending purposefully tries to leave the viewer without any final answers... this is just cheap and trite. We saw that in ""The Road""... which delivered its non-ending with significantly more emotional force.Honestly, this film will soon be forgotten, and for good reason.Where are the Blade Runners of this generation?",Snowpiercer

Well, the story had a considerable amount of things that did not make sense indeed. If it was just about a straight-forward fight between the bad people and the good people, like Hunger Games, I would have to concentrate on plot holes and battles. But instead, this movie was more deep and allegorical than that kind of overused and cheesy scenario. It showed the imperfections of the human race, either they belong to higher or lower classes, how people can change when it comes to survival, how the most benign people can be misjudged and vice versa, and how one can be leaded to self-destruction when not the whole picture is seen.Apart from that, the acting and the scenes were great and the whole movie kept you interested, even if sometimes I was like ""...what"".

Would function well assuming people is well educated... (understanding balance is needed)//2//Their great plan is to have a regular uprising to kill off people and keeping the population down? WHAT? See my first point. - The plan of making revolutions comes from the top (the front of the train)//3.//They used to eat people and babies, but are now disgusted by eating protein bars made by cockroaches? - maybe when the poor people entered the last wagons there were too many, bullets were abundant, time passed and they discovered there could be something more (something better) not because our ancestors walked without shoes we do it too)//4// Cockroaches origin: - they prepared for this, they feed them (more details are needed when imagination is difficult)//5// Perpetual motion: - maybe some parts of dialog were skipped, in the movie is said this train was a one (wealthy) person endeavor, he was a train aficionado, also at the end they showed how children are used to move some parts of the machine//6// People ready to kill- Funny, maybe many were pumped up by the revolution//7//Loosing their limbs - not many people, only when they describe the beginning of the journey that was done//8// What the hell happened with that one bad guy who got stabbed through his guts and choked?(... Tilda Swinton gets a knife through the leg, but walks fine right afterwards) - nice observations, I was thinking in the word said at the ending: you must be crazy to survive in this train, so maybe the guy who choked juts pretended... also the Korean guy was stoned like all the time//9//(..Charlie and the chocolate factory style) - yeah, the classroom is pretty crazy too//10// Many killing axe wielding fighters and the torch - they outnumbered their bullets they said... (I believe many follow that review advice of just skipping to the action sequences and not bothering to understand more)//11//Need to use bullets at the end - what about watching the movie up to the end to understand this was planned (maybe the owner of the train wanted to help as many as possible not forgetting some balancing in the process)//12//Sniping with a submachine gun - Entertaining, that IS Hollywood action//13//Shooting comrades - only shot them when his comrades were a hindrance and he spared the one who said: I saw nothing//14//Engine and small skids - they mention some parts wore out(excessive usage of some parts demanded a replacement) ... a human one in this case//15//Location of places - Funny, coincidences maybe?//16//Policy on drugs - maybe like in accounting or thermodynamics, you see only total balances count, so drug addicts are just elements there, no need to regulate them//17// Drug being C4 - it doesn't just lie around next to the engine room, it lied around all the train, that's how they collect it//18//Why not pay attention to what the Korean guy is doing to open the doors and then open them themselves instead of having him slow them down? - maybe each door is different...//19//Fish blood on axes - maybe a scare tactic //20//Effect of explosion in other cars - maybe the drug explosive acted as a shaped charge (weird I know), maybe it was weak... good to think about it//21//arm sacrifice - I saw he just losing his hand//22//People who escaped earlier - maybe the winds are special... like that effect where rocks seems to move in Death ValleySci-fi does not try to fool anyone but only ponders some possible futures and scenarios along with some questions and issues which could benefit if more though was put into them.

I made sure I paid attention when I saw this movie. (I am not Japanese nor Korean, btw) In case you didn't notice, the director made all the throw-away, coward or useless characters who got killed very quickly speak Japanese and he made a clumsy foreigner the sushi chef. And the supposedly real heroes of the film just happens to be both Koreans!I had major problems with the originality in visual, plot and the quality in sound and editing.

All i see is an allegory (i gonna use that word a lot).You have to see the whole train as humanity in depth of time.You ask yourselves.... why to eat their limbs at first and then eat the cockroach-protein bars? Cause that's what humanity did in an allegoric way for centuries! And then the ""lower social layers"" agreed to eat protein bars (but they don't know what this protein is really made of..) So STOP trying to explain where all these cockroaches come from ! It's an allegory!!!You say it is dumb for such an excellent machine to need kids for maintenance..... Hello?! Where are you living? This is exactly whats happening to our ""perfect machine-societies"". Underage kids and poor people keep the machine moving! Allegory !You wonder how is it possible for the henchman to get up after choked to death.... ALLEGORY ! The protectors of the system will never die! They will continue to try to protect the system no matter what!Someone said that the plot is stupid cause there was no need to split the train into classes! It would run better if everyone has treated equally... Yeah right .... tell that to the kids in Pakistan sewing the latest shoes and clothes. We are not having Sosialism but Capitalism! So there again, allegory!Things that gave me the chills: -The slaughterhouse is next to the school. -The club (party division) is next to the ""machine"" -Anyone that jumped off the train could not make it too far. People must always remember that, and that why it's taught in school. -The head of the machine (elite) is working with the leader of people at the back, cause that's the only way to keep the train going.I could say a bunch of examples of how this applies in our world. -The first class passengers didn't try to stop the revolution, although shocked by it. Until someone stole their ""drugs"" (maybe money. -The head of the machine organized occasional,controlled, revolutions.-When someone finally makes it to the ""engine"" he is talked to be the next leader of the train.I could write more but i think you got the point.

The basics of the movie are rather simple to understand and it can be watch as only an action movie since it contains insanely good action scenes. But this movie has such a deep message and it would actually be a mistake to judge it has ""pessimist and irrational"" or ""violence just for violence"". You'll see in Snowpiercer the true nature of man and how he is corrupted, this is not only about money but about every single aspect of mankind. It's a lesson about how society works. Of course it's open to interpretation, especially the end of it. Quite controversial and harsh for the viewers. A must see for those who can handle a certain amount of violence.",Snowpiercer
868,nehavsurana,Worth watching if you like dystopian world movies. Good performances.,6,1 March 2020,"It is a movie about dystopian future which does end in a world where life can survive. It is about a train that is self sustainable and can run eternally. The engine is called ""sacred"" and was invented by a person named Wilford. To sustain the life within the train the balance has to be maintained ecologically and other systems in the train.There is no life outside train. It was in 2014 that to stop the Global warning extreme measures has to be taken. The product called CW7 was sprinkled in the atmosphere to reduce the heat. It did reduce the heat but to an extreme. The world froze and all life became extinct except for the life within the train.When the story starts its been 17 years for the people in the train. The people in the trail section of the train are treated as hell. They have rarely any resource except for a worst kind of protein food that is made out of worms. It looks like a black jelly bar and everyone eats only that to survive. These people have no life. There have been a few revolts in all these years and this particular story is about a new revolt and the main character driving this revolt is Curtis. There is one elderly man who knew the owner, the most powerful man on train and world, Wilford. So he guides Curtis on his revolt against the first class citizens of the train in the head compartments.Good amount of violence in the movie to create horror, but unpleasant to watch. For instance when one of the revolter's hand is smacked into pieces after freezing it outside the train for some time. Once in a conversation Curtis tells that he hates himself for knowing how a human tastes and babies taste better than adults. 17 years ago when the train started the tail compartment were squeezed in the small space with nothing to eat at all. Some men crossed the limits of humanity when hungry for a month and killed other humans to eat. Curtis was one of them. Some other people started offering their hands cut of their bodies to save babies and kids.Wilford is typical villain, inhuman and thinks his brutal ways are the only way keep the train sustainable and everything in balance. In the end when Curtis reaches the head of the train to fight with Curtis, he tells that it as his plan and Gillian (elder man) knew about this. Now Curtis should take his place and keep running the train in the same way. To maintain one of the system Wilford got children from the tail of the train so that they can do the manual work in the small chamber which is not big enough for an adult.In the end, the highly inflammable drug that was being used to open the head compartment door, catches fire and blasts. The train breaks into pieces and everyone dies. Except the 17 year old Yona and a small kid. But they are out of the train. Although there is snow everywhere but it is sunny and it is not so cold. They see a polar bear meaning that life is not coming back to Earth!",Snowpiercer

872,gabycprado,Great Movie!,10,31 May 2014,"I HAVE to say that this movie was great from beginning to end! It was similar enough to draw inspiration from the beautiful French graphic novel but different enough so that if you have read the graphic novel, you still won't know how the movie develops or ends. There were parts that were heartbreaking and others that were laugh out loud funny and a lot of action sequences for the boys. It is a movie about class systems and the evil they can create. There was even a Soylent Green part that grossed me out even though I knew it was going to come sooner or later. It was visually very stunning and the acting was as can always be expected from Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton and the rest of the cast some of the best. I recommend this movie to everyone!!!",Snowpiercer
873,andreas-liljander-276-327760,"Any rotten vegetable, come this way",3,6 July 2020,"A lot of people, inconceivable, rises this movie to the skies, but they either must have some previous knowledge of the underlaying plot or just don't like an elaborated story nor characters with depth and background. To be honest it's amazing how little that is being told in two hours: It's simply people walking and fighting there way through a train that races through the snowy, post-apocalyptic landscape. The train's master and owner is an intangible figure and is seemingly, in the context, an evil counterpart to the Oz wizard. I get that it's not ment to be realistic, that is not my point here, but where movie makers like Tim Burton and David Lynch use the absurd and surreal as a back drop to tell a story, this movie is frankly just weird and leaves a lot of loopholes and seemingly important things unexplained and unfolded. There is not really any smartness or finesse when our heroes go on their quest through the train and encounters both foes and gets horrific ""epiphanies"". The more quirky episodes are somewhat amusing, and in that sense comparable to Alice's adventures in the rabbit hole, but they are cut short and without the clever dialogue and drollness a, say, Burton picture might have. The underlaying theme is probably that society is stratified, but that is well more explored and better done elsewhere. I'd recommend post-apocalyptic themed movies like »Escape from New York«, »Soylent green«, and even »Elysium« for that matter. Even if you like »fight to go forward in a weird place«-action this might be your kin of movie, but I honestly think you should watch »Big trouble in Little China« instead, since it at least is a cult classic, although not particularly good. To conclude, any claims of this movie being clever is simply not true. It is not worth your time.",Snowpiercer
874,jehnt,Delightfully bizarre action flick,9,12 July 2014,"I thought Snowpiercer was highly entertaining. It was not world-changing or a mind-blowing social commentary or anything like that. Let's get that out of the way first. Yes, it was metaphorical. But the metaphor was SO in your face that it kinda didn't really have an impact. I mean, if you've ever read or watched much scifi before you've already encountered this sort of thing. Based on the buzz, I went in expecting a lot of pretentious bull. I found instead a delightfully bizarre action flick with well-realized characters.There are a lot of conceits you just have to take for granted starting out. Like the whole setup. Or the fact that there are going to be some really surreal bits that are just in there to give it an otherworldly feel. If you need straight-up logic, you PROBABLY shouldn't be seeing a film called ""Snowpiercer"" that is about a dystopian future on board a train after the icepocalypse.BUT. The character arcs! They were good. Pretty much every single character had their entire world view upended. The two born on the train that we see most end up out of the train. The main character gets everything he wants but finds out he doesn't want it. The man who built the gates destroys the ultimate gate. The man who had the ultimate faith in their leader is abandoned by him (justifiably, but still). Et cetera.It's also just a very pretty movie, and there are lots of fun little bits in it that added to the atmosphere.I am normally not squeamish about violent scenes but these were cringe-inducing. Also, people lose limbs a lot. I think it's probably appropriate for ages 13+.Quite frankly, I rate on entertainment value, not on disassembling every bit of the movie. So I give this 9 out of 10. Not ten out of ten because 1) there was a rather unfortunately dramatic and pretentious intro bit with some lame conspiracy theory music, and 2) THE POLAR BEAR. Just no to the polar bear.",Snowpiercer
875,gylgam,Brillian Film Making,10,13 April 2014,"If you wonder how most of the things would have worked on such a train, don't, because they wouldn't. The story does right to not go into too many technical details which would have just ruined the film.What the film is about is mostly social and philosophical issues, like the most striking one: the purpose of our existence on this planet.Aren't we all in a ""train"" that goes around every year, blasting some of the obstacles away, losing some of the passengers, making or hearing big speeches that mean very little, adopting false notions about ""Sacred God"", ""Sacred Socialism"" or ""Sacred Capitalism"" that will never fail us, despite the fact that they fail us all the time?.Aren't we turning it slowly but surely into something that looks less and less like a place we would really want to live in? Does our food even taste like food anymore? Do we even remember how real food tastes like? We can't get off this ""train"", most of us don't ever get to leave our section, so the only thing that we can actually do is enjoy the ride and every day as it was our last, because it might as well be.Also is any individual worth more than the whole? For the last thirteen years we have been preached that any single life has less and less value when it comes to removing ""imminent threats to the whole"". The train ride has gotten much rougher since 911 and the ""banking crisis"" and the tail sections have been fed worse than roaches in order to keep the very few at the top of the train in full control and in a luxurious style of living.But do not worry, the revolution is coming...P.S.

Maybe for those who live in a democratic country and never bother to think about what politics really means and what other governments in the rest of the world are like would not understand the true sense of this movie. I don't blame them. But if you ever know something about the operation of the giant machine, i.e.: a country, you will see how this movie is realistic under a sci-fi cover.

You honestly never know what's going to happen and that aspect is what makes it such a fun watch. It also makes you think by the end of it which is always a good indicator of a well made film. I've seen a lot reviews that are strikingly similar which just list out ""flaws"" of the film and the plot, but those are probably the most overly knit picky reviews I've ever read. It's a sci fi social commentary for god sake and just like any wildly ambitious sci fi movie it's a bit ridiculous in a few aspects as there is a clear point the director is trying to make or series of ideas being conveyed. I highly suggest this movie to anyone who wants something that will keep them immersed, engaged, and have something to think about once it ends.

I don't see how this movie could have a 7 out of 10 average. There were a few interesting characters who did decent acting, but overall the movies was horrible, don't waste your time. OK, after trying to submit and not being able to because I need a minimum of 10 lines of text to be able to submit, I really have to find more to talk about because I feel like it's my duty to warn other movie watchers about how bad this movie is. The concept is just stupid, I feel like my 12 year old could write a better storyline! I'm willing to stretch my imagination to believe some far fetched ideas, but this movies just continues to put stupid stuff out there that its just not even fathomable!! How did they get the actors they got to do this movies, it's crazy dumb. And if it was supposed to be a spoof, then maybe I'd laugh and go along with it, but it was supposed to be realistic!!

It is difficult to describe the mixed feelings that came with this film. The visuals were certainly good. Both the costumes of the actors and the interiors of the snowpiercer were interesting, and created with attention for detail. The choreography of the many fight scenes wasn't bad either, although it might be a bit too theatrical for many viewers. The real disappointments came with the plot, which is so filled with holes that you could drive a post-apocalyptic train right through it. The entire premises of the film requires quite a suspension of disbelief, and continues from there with a series of inconsistencies and occurrences tat require even more suspension of disbelief. The actors are doing their job, but most have very shallow roles that don't give them much to do their job with. Even the 'bigger' stars such as Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris don't succeed in giving their characters credibility. In the end the movie is somewhat enjoyable, but by no means good.",Snowpiercer

The whole plot including its plot holes is awful. In so many ways. The cuts/camera is bad. Some aspects of the fighting and shooting is also very bad. But the very worst is that ending.

My friend wanted to see ""The Room"" at the same time at our awesome Tucson theatre The Loft. The Room is considered the worst movie ever made and has spawned a cult following and interactive screenings that involve screaming at the camera man to focus, and throwing spoons. I didn't get to enjoy that because I cleverly thought, ""why go see a bad movie for $9 when I can see a great movie for $9?"" Boy was I wrong!SPOILER ALERT: IT'S AN ALLEGORY First off, I KNOW IT'S AN ALLEGORY (people here who loved this movie seem to wave this around like it somehow saves it from how sucky it is). I'm not stupid. In fact, viewers are hammered over the head with the idea that it's an allegory so constantly, it's like the movie was made so that a high school film class elective would have a really good example of allegory in a movie. Once you get over the amazing and totally surprising and awesome fact that it's an allegory about class inequality in our world, etfuckingcetera, the movie pretty much sucks.1. The acting is horrible--maybe not as bad as in ""The Room""--but really pretty bad. The only good role is the young Asian girl - but really all she has to do is quietly say scary things once in a while and look a little freakish.2. The dialogue is worse than the acting. There are far too many times when characters are literally just saying stuff to explain things to stupid people in the audience. As much as I HATE narration in a movie - it would have been better than having characters narrate without supposedly narrating. 3. Just too many plot holes - again, I know it's a sci fi allegory - but please just make one damn thing make some sense. I will fully give you perpetual motion - fine - but when the main character, who (spoiler!), once ate BABIES, gets horrified, HORRIFIED, that the protein bars he's been eating for 15 years are made of cockroaches (goodness gracious!)- that's just a stupid unnecessary plot hole. 4. And the absolute worst thing about this movie (big spoiler alert): POLAR BEARI shoulda gone to see ""The Room""!",Snowpiercer

Unfortunately the film never waivers from the allegory even when you get the message after ten minutes. Still waiting for plot surprises? Sorry there won't be any. The only point in waiting for the end is just to see what happens. Trust me, if you having washing to do, do that instead. Spoiler Alert !

889,econno,"Drama-Queen Direction, Juvenile Cinematography",1,3 January 2015,"Drama-Queen Direction, Juvenile Cinematography, and C-grade, third-world level of sophistication: It's almost as if just because you know the situation, you are supposed to be invested, and care. But movies need to give a little something to get a viewer's love... Don't they?THE CONTENT and WRITING: It's pretend apocalypse time with as much intellectual spin as an average four-year-old could muster, with one attempt at mini-climax after another. These mini-moments are provided in wanna-be action sequences full of unconvincing character passion, such as during the rebellion-planning by a routine (ho hum), resentful lower class, or in fight scenes portrayed with the embarrassing camp of early kung-fu movies - fake sounds and sprayed blood. (And Tarantino-class this does not begin to suggest. Besides which there's no kung-fu!) Actually, the fight scenes are quite disappointing.Possibly the worst part is the 1950's-style, backward psycho-drama, which comes across as belabored and self-absorbed, and is thus comically pathetic. For example: A supposedly important personal development moment for the main character is when he acknowledges, in self-pitying whine, that Gee, I ate baby flesh when I was starving. Come on, Chris Evans is pretty flat-affected (which is why he makes a good purpose-driven Marvel automaton), and in this confession, the actor Appears to be Striving for Impact, but it was not at all persuasive. It was supposed to segue into the Personal Growth Highlight of the Entire Movie: His redemption comes in the form of sacrificing his hand to save a child, but by then?? We've already seen that in this movie repeatedly, and there is not enough buy-in with this character's emotions to be even mildly moved. And the Really Big Deal of blowing open a hole in the train? That was one uni-dimensional character's raison d'etre, but it was immediately and utterly overshadowed by the destruction of the train in a landslide ANYWAY. You see, all of it leads absolutely nowhere; so perhaps it is only the depressed, existentially-enthralled who could find any value here.THE DIRECTION: There are long, long, boring moments between thoughts and actions, and between comments and responses, as if viewers could not possibly comprehend and therefore needs LOTS of time to get with the program. These drags do not increase tension, or contribute to plot movement, or reveal ANYTHING. This results in the director appearing truly ignorant of the craft, or at least out of touch with modern mind-sets. I can't help but wonder if the actors are either embarrassed or joking amongst themselves about their participation... It's a paycheck, right? No emotion seems genuine, despite that some of these actors have Good Salt. As every last actor performed like an amateur, I can only blame the direction.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Let's look at people from the ceiling at a weird angle so we can feel radically artsy! Then, let's shake the camera around a bunch so the picture is blurry, and it will seem like there is actually something going on! Thank you for reading. KEC",Snowpiercer
890,caoc_18,Answers how God works(Not so spoiler alert),10,1 February 2014,"It's an eye opener. If you will look deeply enough into the concept of this movie, you will realize that it is explaining how God(if there is)works, because you can compare the train as Earth itself(you'll know why) and the passengers on it are all of us having different lives, jobs or stature in life. The balance that the train has is also how God balances the things that are ""important"" only in his eyes. For example, when Paul(the protein shaker/maker) is ask to come with the ""Curtis revolt"", he didn't. Why? Because someone's got to man up and do it and also because he knows about the ""plan"". When Tanya and Andrew's child are taken and forced to work, bam! child trafficking and child labor which is true and happening in our world. When Mason said that sushi is only served twice a year because of the perfect ecological system, that's also how God balances the ecological system of the Earth and of course we are involved or killed in the process(phenomenons).Wilford depicts God because the people that follows his order, worships him and calls him merciful, benevolent and whatnot has a form of religion that started when they were educated by their Teacher about the greatness of Wilford shown in the scene where the children is sounding/looking like attending a church instead of a class. Also, the only way you can speak to Wilford is when he wants to, because of when Mason tried to speak to Wilford at the tail of the train, he didn't get any response. Egghead depicts death/evil which is also summoned/created by God. Why? Go and figure it out. Great movie.",Snowpiercer

Especially the fusion of western and Asian movie style worked wonderfully in my opinion. Before I watched the movie, I was unsure about the plot since a train for the last of mankind seemed a little too far fetched to me (engineer here). However, the premise is not really that important here, since the movie tries to define and analyze human behavior when put in extreme conditions. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, due to the fact that it did just that very well. There are not many movies that can be compared to this one (The Road maybe). Performance wise, everyone did an excellent job. Especially Chris Evans showed his best performance and Tilda Swinton was just beautifully hilarious.

While its good that you enjoyed the movie, I am surprised at how most people here are overlooking some of the pretty terrible choices. I will be going through what I thought worked, and what kept me from enjoying the movie. Needless to say; MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD.The good: I like the plot, for the most part. Although I find the idea of a train being humanity last home extremely weird, it makes for a nice backdrop. The tone of the movie reminds me a lot of The Hunger Games. Chris Evans does pretty good. The wagons themselves have amazing character. The Art Director should be praised the most out of the entire film crew.The bad: Well, let me sum it up in questions. Questions keeping me from loving this: 1. Why divide the train into classes? This makes no sense. The train ecosystem would function fine with some rules regarding population control. 2. Their great plan is to have a regular uprising to kill off people and keeping the population down? WHAT? See my first point. 3. They used to eat people and babies, but are now disgusted by eating protein bars made by cockroaches? How does that work? And furthermore: 4: WHERE did all those bloody cockroaches come from? 5: If you've invented perpetual motion; why the hell use it in a train? Why not use it to power a generator in a camp, or heat a underground city? The train is death on tracks, with ice regularly blocking the path. 6: Why is everyone on this train ready to kill? Seriously, 90% of EVERYONE is ready to throw down here. 7: People take loosing their limbs SHOCKINGLY well in this movie. Like it's just a flesh wound, really. 8: What the hell happened with that one bad guy who got stabbed through his guts and choked? He just gets up? Why did the korean guy stop his girl from stabbing him? And the korean girl later misses him by 7-8 shots? Furthermore: Tilda Swinton gets a knife through the leg, but walks fine right afterwards.9: Those weird antics of the characters. The woman in the yellow dress licking her blood off her fingers. Tilda Swinton with her strange comedic performance (although I did like the character, I found it a bit distracting), that incredibly weird Korean couple acting all over the place, things like the masked guy just smiling at Evans when they are sitting down. Sometimes I felt like I was watching Charlie and the chocolate factory. 10: The starved people of the tail takes out an army of axe wielding fighters with night vision? After apparently yelling for help through the entire train, and a kid lighting a torch, and running up to them in no time? Stretching it thin, movie! 11: The soldiers had bullets, but they weren't using them at the ONE PLACE they needed bullets? Are you serious?? 12: The shootout between Chris Evans and what I can only assume was Terminator. On opposite sides of the train, probably 1000ft from each other. Sniping with a submachine gun. Through a blizzard. Nice aim there, fellas. 13: Mr. Terminator shooting his comrades all the time. Seriously. What was to be gained from that? He did it several times. Who is this guy?? 14: The only way the train can function is to stuff small kids down small holes to keep the engine running? Really? Was the train designed to stuff small kids down there, or did it just appear to be the perfect solution? How convenient. 15: The wagon closest to the engine is the RAVE-CLUB where all the freaks go to party? Incidentally, the elementary school is next to the slaughterhouse.16: There is no policy on drugs on this finely tuned train? Everyone just goes buck wild with this incredibly potent drug next to the engine room? And furthermore... 17: The drug of choice is basically C4? And it just lies around everywhere - again - next to the engine room? 18: Why not pay attention to what the korean guy is doing to open the doors and then open them themselves instead of having him slow them down? 19: The people with axes putting fish blood on their weapons before fighting? That was random. 20: The other wagons are TOTALLY unaffected by the explosion in the first wagons. Wow. They don't really notice until they derail. What a masterfully crafted train. 21: I know it fits with his story, but did Mr. Evans really need to sacrifice his arm to pull that kid out? He could probably stop the machine with something else than a limb and take better care of that child. 22: The people who jumped off the train still haven't been covered up by snow after 15 years in a never-ending blizzard?Those were some of the things that stopped me from loving this movie. It just got too dumb. There was definitely something here, and I feel this could have become an excellent movie with more thought put into it. It came off extremely unrealistic. And in sci-fi, it's all about fooling the audience into thinking it could have happened. That's the ""science"" part.All in all though - probably an entertaining movie if you'e not a nitpicker like me. Thankfully a lot of you aren't :)EDIT: Someone corrected me in that the couple were korean, and that one of the bad guys never takes a bullet, like I thought he did. Sorry about that, but it still seems far fetched.",Snowpiercer

It is cringeworthy, weird, and too long and slow for what it is.Sure, I could analyse this properly and post a more considered report on here, but really, it was so dumb I don't want to waste any more of my life on it.I just wanted to write this to warn potential viewers that the 7/10 or so rating that this movie has currently on IMDb does not mean that it is good or watchable or satisfying in any way.And the ending sucks, just like the rest of it.

Even though it has some well known actors from the U.S., I didn't think a Korean movie would end up being shown there. After watching the trailer, I was really excited to see the movie. I love movies. I go and watch movies all the time, but sadly I'm not very critical about them.However, this movie was amazing. I strongly recommend watching it. It's spectacular. Even though it's considered ""low budget"" by Hollywood standards, it has amazing visuals and a great story line. I was riveted the whole way through. I really can't stop thinking about the movie and how I think I might even go back to the theater to see it again (which is something I never do). So really--it's great. I'm not a huge fan of the ending, but overall the movie was fantastic!",Snowpiercer
899,luffia10,"For director, this theme is too heavy...",7,6 August 2013,"The one of the reasons that George O'well's 1984 has been memorial creatures is that it displays and explains enough to make the 'world'. As everyone know, his background is so enough that he could not easily denied by some people. However, this movie 'snowpiercer' could not develop enough plots to proceed too heavy themes. Personally, Director is one of my favorites but he could not fully express his intrinsic reasoning. Or he could not be equitable to direct this philosophical movie yet...Specifically, as i watch the movie, all the time i was thinking why the train should go. Of course, there would be many explanations for the reason that the train should run. However, in the end the train stop and movie also stop in that point. From concluding that the train don't have to go forever, director could convey his intention, but it could not fully explain why the train should be selected.",Snowpiercer

The message seemed one dimensional, and the whole 'action' bit from the trailer wasn't really that impressing. Only thing that dragged me to the theater was the director's name (also the great cast), and i am happy to say that i'm pleasantly blown away by director Bong once again. The movie looked great, the first half was beyond thrilling, the acting for the latter half was just, top notch, the action was bloody and fantastic, and most of all, the ideology behind the story was interesting to say at least. I can't really say anything more than that since saying anything beside the trailer would be a dead giveaway, but really, wow. I honestly don't know how the director's unique style and choices would get to the American audience, but as a person who enjoys this strange and beautiful execution of director Bong, this movie fulfilled everything i want from Bong's film an intellectual Sifi movie. It gave me a handful amount of things to think and talk about, and those kinds of movies always give me the best movie experiences. Definitely one of the must watches of this year.",Snowpiercer

It has it own entertaining quality and at the same time, it is very philosophical. First time I have watched I did not quite understand the last part of the movie and felt it is a bit weird, but after finally I've watched this movie again.... I saw details which I have missed when i first saw this movie whilst absorbed into its entertaining moment..... and then when i get to the ending, I felt like wow.. this is masterpiece!... I think Chris Evans should be pround of his choice and his acting and Tilda swinton is just awesome.... and Grey is so attrative in this film! and other actors did great job here. Except CGI where it looks like unreal animation when it crashes into the ice,(although its animatic quality when the viewing from outside the window looks not really real, but it looks beautiful which makes this movie so much more unique.) this movie deserves the praise!.",Snowpiercer
903,tony77734,Best Film I have ever watched in my entire life.,10,31 August 2013,"To start you off on describing how much I loved this move, I will tell you that I have watched this movie 4 times in theaters. I am a Korean- American, and I went to Korea for the Summer Break after completing my first year of college. I had heard throughout the year that director Bong was directing a film based off of a French graphic novel. I thought it was interesting, but decided to lose interest so that I could watch the film in Korea without expectations. So upon my arrival to Korea, I set out to watch this phenomenal movie starring some of the most well-respected actors and actresses in the world. The story was challenging and bold, the acting was astounding, the CG was exquisite, and the build up throughout the movie was subtle and unnoticeable. This movie will blow you away. I even have to say it surpasses my previous favorite film, Inception. Snowpiercer has depth, an uniquely innovative quality, and a daring message.",Snowpiercer
904,sleipnir796,Horrible Script,4,12 April 2014,"I'm gonna start telling you what was delightful about this movie. The set, the environment design, the wagon ideas. It was fairly decent, and like it or not, it was well developed. The main character was credible and strong in the plot. It wasn't a win-win hero, it was more like a courageous man making human mistakes. And finally ignoring the fact that its hard to believe in a non-stop train and century durable railways with no maintenance whatsoever, the whole idea of the moving train and the end of the human race all stuck together was fresh and somehow charming. That was the good part. But if you already seen this movie, you are probably not here to hear whats good. You are here because like myself at the credits you felt like something was missing, but you couldn't put your finger on it at the time. Here is whats wrong: 1)First off, the train different rooms(school, pub, sushi-bar) are horribly distributed. Why would a society have to walk trough a junky dancing club to get to the engine? Does every soldier walk through kindergarten to get to the tail? Or trough a freaking spa? 2)How do this society work? How do people go shopping? Go to sleep? I got all about the tail people, they sleep on piled mattress and eat garbage. I got it. But what about the classy ones? To they live drinking on a pub?3)Whats with the fish blood on the axes? Whats with the staring? Before any fight, both sides take some minutes (sometimes hours) to stare each others. 4)The glasses yelling lady is one of the stupidest characters ever. I don't know if that counts at good acting or not. The character was just awkward. I started hating on the movie as soon as she started being weird and uncomfortable. 5)The school part was a strong sociological moment on screen. They wanted to show us indoctrination on a nutshell. It was clear at the first 6 minutes of the scene, there was no need to make the blonde teacher play the piano with a multiple orgasm expression. There was no need on the choo choo and ""we will die we will die"" remarks. We got the idea, (and the Catholic references too).Is this Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory?? 6) Don't you hate when a bad guy dies 7 times, and its still NOT ENOUGH to make him leave the plot? 7)The main character became a monster long ago when he started feeding on baby flesh. I don't believe there's a way back from there, i mean. When did he started being good again?. If he wants to kill someone he might as well kill himself. 8)Again, the man ate human bodies, why is the idea of eating a insect so disgusting? Why would he keep that as a secret from the other cannibals? Come on! 9)Why didn't the little Asian girl wake up when the blonde shoot his father? WHY ON EARTH? she was right there sleeping on the frigging floor! I even saw here moving for crying out loud! 10)The train worked fine for 18 years and there's no rush. So why on earth wouldn't you grab on a piece of metal or something to stop the machine? Was is to necessary to stop the engine with your own hand? Was it possible? What? Do you have steel bones or something?",Snowpiercer

The train are going round and round, it can't be the first time they crash through ice. I mean it feels like they would be a bit prepared for it, and maybe have the common sense to slow down. Or they should have tipped over a long time ago.In the beginning his hand got so frozen by being outside of the train that it shattered when hammered on. In the end of the movie it's suddenly warm outside due to super fast climate change, come on.How did they know that they were going to see frozen men in the snow. Wouldn't they be buried by now, or eaten by polar bears?Since they walked through the whole train, where is the bathroom?,How do they fix bullet holes in the glass.?, from where do they get drugs?In the end when the ""god bless America"" music starts why does she look happy when she sees the polar bear, it's not like she is going to survive anyway.",Snowpiercer

Reading all the reviews - people really love or hate this movie! I love all the plots (or WTF moments) that didn't make sense. The axe fight scene was nuts...who brings a fish (an endangered one at that) to a fight, why were their faces covered, what was with the intermission to say Happy New Year, and did the torch passing remind anyone else of the Olympics?

But...There are gaping plot holes including some very bad science. Which could all be forgiven, but...It relied heavily on dystopian and apocalyptic tropes. The big surprise (at least it's directed like it's supposed to be a surprise) is one of the oldest surprises in the genre (as are the other more minor ""twists""). Which would be fine, but...The acting/directing was alright *shrug* except for the bits that were really bad. An important scene that should have been tremendously moving wasn't because it just wasn't done well. And I suppose I could have even overlooked that, but...Metaphor should be used subtly. It's wonderful to have it. It's fantastic to have a story that means more than the plot and leaves us with moral implications to think about. You needn't beat your audience over the head with it though. Having a character go into a two minute monologue explaining the meaning of the metaphor as though the audience were in lit class and ending it with a sentence telling us the analogy is *too much*.It was, however, poetic and beautiful. It also did some lovely contrasting bits with music.",Snowpiercer

I'm not sure which parts were cut out but I'm guessing the insect grinder is? (maybe they were human grinders) Hopefully the uncensored and the real version would be better when it gets released here in the U.S. in June, can't wait.I don't know why people complain about why the train and frozen world doesn't make sense, I mean unless your dumb that's not what the movie is about. It's a movie because it can have its own setting, time and place... that's why it's a darn movie. For me the movie portrays what the real world is like... the rich and powerful abusing their powers not caring what the poor, working class and middle class feels or do. To me it seems the movies showing that some people fight and they fight hard to get to the top, not knowing what awaits in the future(or front of the train). I actually thought this movie was great.

As I read on another review (and I couldn't agree more), it was very reminiscent of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.A big question..why are there classes in the first place?? Everyone knows what happens from experience and media, that when there is some sort of disaster people come together. Classes are only built where money is involved, but surely they would have all been equals going onto the train in the same position as each other.If they had invented a perpetual-motion engine..surely they could have done better than a train which has to run on an ice & snow blocked track?! Smaller details really annoyed me as well...like, after 18yrs on a train, why are all women caked in make up, taylors measuring for new clothes etc?? i'm sorry but no matter how well equipt there is no way they would still have those kind of supplies after all that time.I could go on but I will just be ranting, it was watchable, but completely unrealistic and far fetched.

921,ole-kris-lan,"There are to many; ""What?!"" moments",3,28 March 2014,"I actually like this genre of film, but this was a lousy attempt from this studio. In my opinion there simply are to many things we as viewers are expected to go along with. Without any explanation. Don't agree with me? I will give you some examples then (MAJOR SPOILERS);1. Why did they need to eat each other at the start of their trip, and then suddenly this protein bar-machine appeared. It seems hard to accept that the magnificent Wilford would make this train with room for this low-class people, but with no way to feed them. And how did they make this bug-protein-bar machine while traveling at such speeds?2. Having this class-system and using riots as a way to kill some of the population, seems a very cruel and inefficient way to keep the trains population regulated. And not to mention risky, after all this ""grand plan"" is what sets in motion the events that lead to the trains demise. There are tons of other option that history has shown is better ways to handle situations like this. And what about just plain simple birth regulations? 3. What does the engine run on? Hopes and dreams? explain please. Nuff said.4. How those no part of the railway the train runs on gets destroyed or needs fixing during this 18 year long train ride? In an such extreme climate some part of the rails are bound to be somewhat damaged. 5. At the end of the movie they step outside and into the cold ""harsh"" weather. And let me just tell you. We call that summer in Norway, not an apocalyptic freezing weather. There truly need to be some better way to deal with the problem of this ""extreme"" weather. (and yes i know it was the middle of the day and the weather was nice, and maybe its worse at other times and blah blah, but still, doesn't seam to make sense.)'6. The peoples behavior wasn't believable either. First of all, we need to remember that it was an closed environment, and people in the different classes all knew each other. And when after 18 years on this train some of the upper-class people see these dirty, bloody and new faces, they don't seem to give one single f**k. Not one single one of them. And why did Curtis choose to destroy the engine, the only thing that was keeping all the people on the train alive, to temporarily save one kid? He basically doomed the whole train, including the child he just saved. (And don't get me started on how he did it, jeezez.)The list of these ""What?!"" moments just goes on and on and on. Some are short and brief, but others (like the examples i have given) are major movie-enjoyment-destroying. The sum of all these moments just leaves you with an bad feeling when you are finished watching the film. BUT, the movie ain't all bad. This fictional setting of the film, makes for a type of film that is enjoyable. But often it boils down to; Are you able to believe the case that the film presents, or do you find it just to unrealistic to bear with. At the end of the movie, where all was revealed, the ""mind blown""-moment. I just sat there with to many questions and a big ""what?!""- expression. And not the ""I-just-got-my- - head-exploded-""What?!"", but the what just happened ""what"". And that the reasons why all this things had happened was the general premise of population control, wasn't mind blowing material, if you ask me.",Snowpiercer
922,The_Wibbler,Wish I'd never watched it,1,29 March 2014,"I've never written a review before and probably never would have, if it weren't for the fact that I'd like to save some other poor soul the torture of sitting through this complete turkey of a film.That's 126 minutes of my life that I wish I'd spent doing something else. If taking 10 minutes to write this review saves just one person from the misery of watching this turgid, rambling, incoherent drivel, then it's 10 minutes that I'll consider well spent.It's a mystery why any actor (other then a need for cash) would have had anything to do with this film once they caught sight of the script. That actors with a decent reputation should get involved, is an even bigger mystery.If this film were written by a brain-damaged five year old I'd say not a bad effort. That this was written by an adult is worthy only of derision. It really is that bad.I thought it was a comedy at one point when I saw Swinton's part. It looked like a poor parody of a character from Wallace and Grommit.Please, please, please do yourself a favour and DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!",Snowpiercer

Not a single scene was was made without few or many illogical or really stupid things/acts. Who ever gave this movie more than one star should really stop reviewing movies since there are many much better movies with lower score. A W E F U L! And no, this movie was not made in a way you look at it as many metahpors. Every single thing about this movie is nothing more than terrible. This movie is insult to intelligence and discrase for any sci-fi movie Tilda's acting was only thing that is at best ""ok"". But that is about it really.",Snowpiercer
924,whodataznkidd,"Great Movie. Response to a reviewers list of ""plot holes galore""",10,1 April 2014,"I noticed many people found the review helpful. I think just distracts 1.The whole train represents humanity. Humanity has always been separated into classes & how it will most likely stay. Many don't agree with this, hence revolutions and revolts the same as the world we live in.(A2)Sex is primal to human nature, even if there's rules, people just couldn't resist and without contraception, population is bound to expand + limited sources of food is not sustainable. Also if the upper class is having children and population is getting high than they would rather kill the poor than their own.2.It is the decision of the well off to kill the lowly poor. It is not the decision as a whole. 3.They ate people to survive when they were being starved to death, many instances in the real world.Even then you wouldn't think you would be ""served"" them.4:Possible explanation: Cockroaches can survive through a lot, could be farmed or could be living with the poor and somehow collected.5:Watch the video in the class room. The train was invented to travel the world in the through harsh environments like the arctic and desserts of Africa like a cruise. it wasn't solely invented for the life ending ""freeze"". The creatures passion was trains.6: For the tail:years of Oppression and wrongdoing led to anger,then rage, then the chance to get out. The group of ax men were placed where they were as a force to stop the tail from progressing further. The people at the end is because of the possible disruption of the way of life they are used to by the tail. Again we may not agree with it, but this is part of humanity7:How? the first man was clearly drugged before they stuck his arm out the hole and he was in pain when they smashed it and the old man lost it a long time ago. How can his pain be measured? When Evans lost his arm it was slow motion because the bomb was going to blow it was only a few seconds before he had to protect the 2 children.8:I wouldn't say stabbed in the guts, but yeah guess he was supposed to be the hard to kill crazy guy. He most likely stopped her because he didn't want his daughter to know what killing a man is like. Tilda: just lack of good acting on her part9:both women were twisted in the head because of the power they had. They are NOT a couple, he clearly introduces her as his daughter and they are drug addicts explaining how they were acting.I didn't find his smiling wacky, tilda actually reminded me of Charlie and the chocolate factory but mostly because of her big glasses.10:They aren't completely starved living off the protein bars. The boy didn't run the whole way, they passed it off like a relay and it showed them running through more than a few sections, by the time they got there they had many people with them which helped take out the rest of the ax men.11:It's definitely questionable. You don't necessarily need bullets when the fear is already there. Thinking to save the bullets for worse situations was just a mistake in judgment.12:I agree that it was a bit of a stretch, but it didn't take anything away from the movie and added a reason to increase the pace.13:Nothing can be gained, It's his personality and ego, if you don't agree with me than you're against me which is the same as many kings and warriors throughout history 14:The reviewer answer their own question, it was the perfect solution to put the child in the hole. He was just removing excess ""gunk"" to keep it going, it's not like he was winding gears endlessly15:You wouldn't put kids near the most dangerous part of the train. If you don't notice the sections leading up to the classroom were gradually safer and in addition they wouldn't even be allowed to go to the section under them. Sections would be strictly controlled just the same as the tail, of course with less force.16:Drugs are all over the world just as in the train. Addicts will always find a way to get high. Probably starting off as people trying to find an escape from the situation they are in just as in society.17:The drug was made from what was around and if you notice they get high by inhaling the fumes. The Korean guy just found another use for it. It was next to the engine room because it was everywhere they went, because drugs are that big of a problem.18:You can't assume he did the same exact thing each time or that he didn't have a technique. He had his own motives so he has no reason to let them figure out how he does it because then he would be expendable.19: Not. They're showing that they are their for blood, to kill them. Classic warrior/ soldier stuff.20:Even while being sarcastic the question was answered by the reviewer. Back to the classroom video. The train was designed to withstand the harshest elements. Simply put it's well built.21:I understand that he could've took the time to find something and It's just purely for the story, but It represents the sacrifice he couldn't make before when so many others did, giving closure.22:One scene explains this. The scene when he explains that every year he looks out of the window at the same plane and at the beginning he could barely see it and at that moment he could see the tail and the wings showing the snow is getting weaker and even melting. ""it just got too dumb"" I hope this answers the questions asked",Snowpiercer
925,aykutaksit,Bad bad movie,1,8 January 2015,"One of the worst movies I have ever watched. Seriously, I can't even begin to understand how people can like this movie.The first thing I'm going to mention is that I was annoyed beyond belief by the lack of realism in this movie. And please try to understand me as I say that I'm not a skeptic. Shooting a science fiction movie, it is my belief that you can be realistic as hell. You can be even more realistic - arguably - than if you were telling a real story. I think ""the force"" in Star Wars was realistic. I even think that talking monkeys (talking monkeys, come on.) were realistic in Planet of the Apes, that's how low my standards are. If you can get your story through, and base it on something, who cares, right? Well this movie could not get its story through. Maybe if in the opening they said something like ""okay in this parallel universe, we forego of logic, these aren't humans just don't expect them to make good decisions"" it would have made perfect sense. That is how annoying the logical inconsistencies were.The second point I want to make is that there is absolutely no social message involved. There was absolutely no ""portrayal of society"" like some people claim. If there was such an intention, they screwed up so badly it is beyond any saving even with the best advocation out there. I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't watched it, but it simply isn't there. Don't look for it.Wish I hadn't watched it.",Snowpiercer
926,tobiasmail88,C-Movie with okay concept but many flaws and lacking story!,4,17 April 2014,"Unlike other reviewer I disagree strongly, that this movie is one of the best or even a good social commentary.Even by leaving the realistic standpoint out of the picture and accepting the nature of this scenario as it is, many plot ""twists"" (most of them not as shocking or unexpected as described by other reviewer) are not only forced in order to create false arguments about classes but also purely there to push the idea, that society always has to have different social tiers. Most of the characters and especially the behavior of them in certain situations are not only unreasonable but also not fitting to the personality they had before. Therefore nearly all characters where expendable and I couldn't care enough about anyone to be shocked or surprised that they die. The story strongly fails to introduce certain ""more important"" character without giving their role for the movie away. This made the movie not only predictable but also disengaging from most shocking events. Everyone had the cliché personality and the stereotypical behavior so that you knew from the beginning, who will die and who will survive until the forced end. Short exception the very end twist (again forced and terribly not-thought-out at the same time)Strong Spoiler Alert after this:The characters you have and don't care about are like most of the time in pseudo deep movies: The ""main hero"" who is just not ready yet to be the leader but still leading everyone. The ""old leader"", everyone is looking up to and sure will die to make room. The ""heroes best friend"" who is going to be sacrificed for the main hero but so not shocking. The ""mechanic"" without him the whole thing wouldn't be possible. The ""important child"" for the ""deep"" plot and surely everyone cares more about then all the other children. The ""mother"" who will die trying to save the child in order to make the main hero even more important involved. The ""social statement bad guy"" who tries to make a forced point by saving herself The ""strong bad guy"", who doesn't die no matter how hard everyone tries and last the ""evil mastermind"" who planned everything from the start and just want to do the right thing for humanity.Introduced with these characters you already knew, who is expendable and how the story is going to unfold. Now even the bad role writing set aside, it could still make a good movie if there weren't that many illogical and surreal behaviors. Now to point just some flaws, that made me personally role my eyes.As mentioned this are purely my personal opinions and you can by all means disagree. Not full list due to limitationYou get introduced to the main character and his buddy chasing the one important kid. Just a minute later, all kids are collected: ""Oh I wonder what will happen to that one kid I was introduced before, would be such a surprise if that one is taken"". For some reason no one cares about that all other kids are taken in front of the group, but when the one ""forced important"" child is taken, everybody cares so much to uproar.The uproar itself, people might not care about it, but I find it hugely distracting if one shot is in a narrow tube all people pinched together, while the next shot is set nearly with free movement and swinging everywhere, just to resume to narrow pinching in the next shot.Where it really went wrong: ""The dark Tunnel"". Hard to describe, but in short: the old-man did plan everything and was trusted completely by the main hero; but somehow he did not know anything about the torches to light the train and make the fight possible. Secondly again personal mind-bugging. They start bringing one torch from the complete back of the train as if they never knew it would go dark, the next scene everyone has a torch and fights with it as if it was planned.The going through the train and nobody cares or does anything. Everyone looks shocked but it feels like the script did not know what to do with them or forgot the rest of the people even exist so everyone just stays still and does nothing.The shooting from one to the next train through window. Not only does this completely destroys the so extremely important closed up environment they all try to maintain, everyone seems to be completely okay with that, because it looks like a good idea.The drug, personal but since so important for the movie very bugging. Collected before he knows it's useful as bargain. Completely illogical way of working: You smell to get high but somehow you need multiple ones because even thou it is exposed to air all the time, it loses its drug potential. You may say he tries to build the bomb at the end and covers his plan, but asking for more at the last door after already collecting enough seemed out of character.The twists at the end. Convincing the ""hero"" to be the new leader and bad-guy instead of raising one a rich kid to understand the engine or how tier-systems work. Use of a child from the end of the train to work the engine instead of raising one or choosing one by explaining the need with offered benefits. would most likely be enough to convince someone to go without a uproar at all.The explosion that wreck the train and kills everyone including all persons the hero tried the whole movie to save. The forced happy-end, you see a polar bear so there has to be a new environment and they might survive. Wishful thinking aside, all food + food-wagons are lost and the two survivors die as well.All in all, c-movie with forced point ending.",Snowpiercer

Nothing deep or thoughtful happens in this movie. NOTHING.You can read any review here on this movie scored 3 or lower and get tons of good ideas on how to NOT DO A MOVIE, but for my own amusement I will list my own top ten ( or twenty or more. You could basically do this all day long ).1) No guard posts are set up, even though there is open rioting going on. Oh, wait. I forgot about the new holiday policy on the train.2)The stupidity of having to control your population by having riots killing off people regularly is... well, at least you save on condoms, right? 3) After FIVE MINUTES of massacre in the tunnel literally everybody is still alive and can call out for torch lights being carried Olympian style through the entire length of the train, to arrive there five more minutes later, to still find everybody intact and in fighting shape. Oh and that torch obviously had babies on its way to the fray. Cute. 4) A full store cabin of foodstuff, yet not a single cart carrying actual livestock. I am guessing the train is actually piggybacked on a cattle trail. Made immune to cold. Yepp, sounds about right. Makes more sense than the engine being a perpetual motion thing anyway. 5) Luring your enemies into your child's classroom, only for the PREGNANT teacher drawing out an Uzi to assassinate them is PURE GENIUS! I always knew teachers had a dark streak, much like clowns, and finally giving them the chance to act on their frustrations... WELL DONE!6) Gilliam works from inside the tail section to instigate riots to help the population control. So we are to believe that a guy gave his arm to cannibalize on willingly to safe a baby in order to stick to a lifetime of poverty and dirt in the tail section to regularly send people to their death? Lolwut? Oh, wait, I forgot. Evereybody on this train is a mental patient, so all is well and everybody is acting normally, within their respective limits.7) I don't think I can do more than five. My eye is starting to twitch nervously just thinking of writing more about this train wreck of a movie.Overall the entire movie gives a lasting impression of a feverish dream while being on a bad trip.And in the end, when everybody except two have killed them self off, you see them meeting a polar bear in the Himalayas and you know everything is going to be well: The polar bear will eat those two, too, and finally the entire train of stupid has come to a halt. Thank you, Mister Polar Bear. Well done!",Snowpiercer
929,odomatic,Train wreck,1,26 April 2014,"How to start this? I think I'll begin with the people who haves this movie a decent review. A lot of reviewers said this was a microcosm of society and the struggle of the rebels showed the climbing through the classes of to the ultimate end which is demise. These people also weren't concerned with the functionality of this microcosm and some even said it would have ruined the film if it was explained. Sweet Jesus lord Buddha Allah Yahweh!I hope these people are never in charge of this fictitious realm that indulges psychotic caste behaviour. We'd all be dead in a week or they would be and humanity would have fighting chance. Which is what this movie implies. Do not fight, know your place and shut up. Although the balance of power makes absolutely no sense in film. The well off out number the unfortunate at least 2:1. Which in a balanced system of hierarchy doesn't happen. There need to be more workers to provide for the upper class. This didn't exist in this story. The overall end game is to maintain humanity in a suspended state with rebellion as regulation to preserve a class system. Know your place. However there is no economic system presented to maintain it. How they select the uppers and the lowers isn't explained. Which brings me back to the people who would find this movie profound. Lack of understanding for the more important self. The scientific laws on this train do not apply. Logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry basically anyone who made it to grade nine should see canon sized holes in this story. Leave aside the perpetual motion machine. A train can't contain industrialized mechanics for a recycling system. Sources have to be introduced for a human organism to be supported. There would have to be scientific control in closed system other than a woman reading a book while the oranges grow. Where is the cockroach harvesting car? The aquarium car must be maintained by the sushi chef. The cleaning products must come from the ammonia produced by recycling urine. The bar gets its alcohol from the engine fumes or that muck the kid was cleaning out. The track that never cracks could be maintained by.... I've run out magical solutions. The idea behind this movie is to demonstrate we are all flawed and try to maintain order in what we think society should be, but it doesn't embrace those flaws. It ignores them and does whatever it can to fight those flaws with no common good. It takes for granted how things are done and who is doing them. Everyone is in it for themselves and will rip apart anyone who gets in their selfish way. If you truly found this movie to be good you are already on that train at the end of humanity and you will not survive that way. It means you already take for granted your own life and all the little white lies you tell yourself are as big as that landscape out of that trains window. That train should have stopped and as someone suggested use the engine to build a sustainable society instead of bombing head on into oblivion with no end in sight. Ultimately this movie could have ended no other way with a failed attempt at maintaining a snooty, greedy, childish society with no responsibility but to its own anal stage of development",Snowpiercer
930,grndybmt,"Ignore the haters, enjoy a fresh film",8,3 June 2014,"My review really addresses the other reviewers complaining about the movie being illogical. For the most part, there aren't really any illogical moments. Almost everything these reviewers complain about is explained in dialogue. And the things that they don't explain are in no way important to the story or the film as a whole. Sounds like a lot of people got stoned and nitpicked at the movie. There are plot holes in every film ever made. It's the plot holes that effect the story that are worth mentioning. None of the ones in Snowpiercer are worth mentioning.Snowpiercer is a great futuristic dystopian sci-fi flick. It's very entertaining and it is a complete breath of fresh air. Ignore the few people who said it reminds them of The Hunger Games (if being poor and not having food and fighting for it reminds you of The Hunger Games, then you must think that the city of Detroit is based on The Hunger Games). I'm sure the mass population hasn't seen a lot of Joon-Ho Bong's films, but if you have, he strikes again here with a great piece of film.This is no Citizen Kane, but it is an entertaining film and it succeeds at what it sets out to do.",Snowpiercer

I also like the movie star song kang ho. he is also a favorite. Suddenly somebody shot at the train the train houses the only people in the world have survived. It is the end of the world. But the survivors also know that different train compartments in the ranks were divided. Ferr-riding peple ride the top of the train with very lower-class people. They are destined to live the rest of their lives in the tall compartment. When they got out of the tail, khan killed them, turning the front comartment in to the instrument of good people. They are passed in front of a column that is only for protein blocks that eat the least nntrients and supplements so they are bound to live. Then they will move forwad as well ad revolt. But they are more and more toward the front compartment of the train and see the dirty private parts, people diying out gradually. The biggest feeling watching this movie wsa that of the control of the balance. There is a scene about persecute people who contact Khan, A woman named prime minster came out in the scene of the movie, to protact their position. I though this scene of the movie is a reality to both of us now.

More plot holes in this crap film than in Prometheus. Almost nothing makes sense(the man who got choked to death and stabbed in the stomach miraculously wakes up a few minutes later and does nothing of importance but stare at the Asian girl before dying, and they felt the need to show this pointless scene? WTF?) Adam Sandler's movies look like gifts from god compared to this crap film. 7/10? seriously? who rated it that high? probably the same person who thought After Earth was a good movie. If you're one of the few who are now curious enough to watch this because you think ""oh it can't be that bad"" well you'll be real happy to see the ending where the last (what? 2 or 3 humans?) discover a polar bear surviving.

Have you ever wondered why we were forced to endure ""PSY"" for an entire summer? It is because the South Korean ministry of culture not only maintains strict screen quotas for what is allowed to be shown in their cinemas domestically, but also puts big bucks into artificially inflating the popularity of their arts. That is why we had to endure ""Kangnam Style"", and that is why Ed Harris, Tilda Swindon, and John Hurt did thi$$$ movie.I actually enjoy Korean films, but I could not, for the life of me, understand why Song Gang Ho was even in this movie.

934,kristina-voy,Best movie in a long time!,10,2 July 2014,"I thought this movie was absolutely genius & that's considering that it was not my favorite genre. After reading some of the reviews and notes on the supposed flaws, I could not help but wish to share my own view of it.***spoilers aheadFirst of all, I do not believe that this movie is meant to be taken literally or make any sense logically. It is a more of an artistic view of the world, a metaphor. Yes, the poor really did not have to be there at all. However the poor, the dirty, the miserable, the angry & the desperate have always existed in our world. It does not matter that they could have easily been unhooked off the train, killed or not let on to the train. They had to be there or else there would be no point to the movie. Again, I believe that the sci-fi apocalyptic events are nothing but a backdrop to the main point. So the train is as world is.. in a metaphorical way. Yes, they could have used population control, but it is the same point as above. Besides, the provoked aggression could have also been used as a reference to the non so uncommon view that many of the world's conflicts were 'produced' in the interest of the ones holding the power. And the people with some belief willingly & desperately throw themselves to likely death are nothing but marionettes playing out their staged parts. The great thing about this film is that it leaves things open to interpretation the way art does.I particularly liked the ending, the final conflict within the character. To me it showed how the hero, the fighter for the better, after the long way to the top (in this case the front engine) himself becomes the chosen, one of the select few that have made it that high up. And it is true as it is the very select few that make it there in the real world. So suddenly he finds himself alone and in the same position as Mr. Wilfred. There is also the obvious understanding that things function as they absolutely must despite being morally wrong if looked at separately. You just think that he is going to take on his new role when suddenly, he changes his mind. This too does not seem ridiculous, especially in the light of him telling the story of the beginning. Now it is understood why he lacked confidence in his leadership and it can be understood why he makes the stupid, desperate decision to harm all instead of harming few. It would seem that he simply could not bear the idea of being that coward again and doing the same to his people after their long & bloody journey to the engine. It seemed as a last minute, emotion-driven, desperate decision to let it happen as it may...as long as it does no stay as was. And it all goes to heck...the entire train. With only a slightest glimpse of possibility of some hope. That can be understood in so many different ways. Maybe even that there is no perfection in our world & can never be? On one hand he had the choice of becoming what he hated & accepting the sacrifices that had to be made, and on the other - breaking the function of existence as was available & known. And who knows what happened next?The idea of a little boy being necessary to run such an advanced engine is also in my opinion, far from flawed. Even if we remember how, by who & in what conditions many things that play a part in supporting the economy are made. This is just in example, many more can be found with a bit of thought in order to see how some things that support the function of our world partially lie on the shoulders of the weakest. That was the very end of the chain so to speak.So the point of this movie to me was exactly in being able to understand the metaphors in many different ways. Had it been a logical & serious story about the division of the classes, it would not have been half as interesting.",Snowpiercer

And I have no problem with the concepts of cannibalism used as a tool to indicate the necessity to control the population in an enclosed environment, but a little pace would have been nice.

937,mollyma15-59-275273,Good storyline that turns ridiculous,6,21 July 2014,"First, the good. The plot is fantastic and unique, though it reminds one of other dystopian films - the world of the future is frozen due to chemicals released to stop global warming, and all of humanity lives on a train that continually circles the globe. Everyone, the poor ""tail-end"" prisoners to the privileged upper class, is trapped, fated to live their entire lives on this vehicle. I loved the design of the train and the world, and how each train car reveals another aspect of the twisted world in which the characters live. It was a fantastic feat of world-building, and the scenes where we see the sleek train traveling through the frozen world are quite chilling yet beautiful. Finally, the acting was great, and made me fully believe the the stakes that the characters had. I didn't even recognize Chris Evans (from Captain America) nor Ed Harris. However, yet again, a movie with no strong female characters. Come on Hollywood!The movie had so much possibility! Ultimately though, despite me really wanting to buy into the movie and let myself drift into its world, there were so many ridiculous story lines and plot holes that I ended up both annoyed and amused. There were many unnecessary dramatic twists, a lot of gratuitous violence and gore (made me feel nauseous), and the ending was also quite unbelievable. Several times during the movie I wanted to throw my hands up in the air and yell, ""really? really?"" at the dumb-ass things some of the characters were doing. Also, there was this psycho murderous villain and we have no idea who he is or why he seems to not be able to die. Seriously, he should have died at least five times in the movie.The cinematography demands that you see Snowpiercer on the big screen.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone that doesn't enjoy crippling boredom mixed with disgust. If I could get these two hours of my life back, I'd be extremely grateful. Do not waste your time on this movie and for the love of god, do not pay to see it. Save yourself the time and money and watch a movie that won't make you want to claw out your own eyeballs. I've never been so disappointed in my life. There was not a single redeeming quality to this film. Every aspect of it is wretched. Absolutely wretched.

Slow down. No one is chasing you. Why go in circles? Where do the animals live?

Cool but nothing else.the idea of suspending belief is one way to try to resurrect the film but it is far too gone for that to work, other than as an excuse for this exploitation of a gullible audience. An audience willing to accept what is really a poorly constructed and internally inconsistent film on the basis that it is cool, or that a SF movie should suspend belief, is gullible in the extreme.This could have been a great film – the elements of a great movie are there but the apparent coolness of the idea meant that a meaningless concept (hey, I have a cool idea how about a hurtling train for ever screaming around the world) destroyed any themes and developments that could have been constructed.What a waste of a movie, what a waste of my time.",Snowpiercer

They try to rip off the matrix and make 0 political points at all. It's supposed to be about the classes but they give no story of the classes. No one on the train at all works, some people only drink and party, some only get their hair done and no one sleeps. One girl randomly has visions and that is never explained again. It is like the actors and directors ate a bunch of acid and just turned a camera on. It makes NO SENSE it is the worst movie I've seen in my life. People who rate this high are obviously fans of some comic it is based on and probably paid promoters. I cannot believe this movie was allowed to be released even on DVD/demand.

942,hemzyy,A slightly dusty one from the shelves.,8,10 August 2018,"""Snowpiercer"" is a great effort at a dystopian classic, based on a graphic novel and directed by Bong Joon-ho, with a prominent American and British cast.
Interestingly, the story spins off from the dooms day effect of global warming and humanity's self-destructive effort to curb it, resulting in a frozen planet with a speeding ""Ark"" on rails - Snowpiercer. The tail of the train is populated by the poor, downtrodden; under the mercy of the richer class up in the front, led by Wilford (Ed Harris), the owner of the train who ""governs"" the train with his make-shift ministers and henchmen. Scarcity of food, water and space to dwell holds the tail down under the iron hand rule of Wilford.
Rebels from the tail, led by an old veteran Gilliam (John Hurt) and his second-in-command Curtis (Chris Evans) break out in defiance with a plan to overpower the tyranny and bring order and fairness into Snowpiercer, leading to an epic battle of wits, strategy and sheer numbers between Curtis and Wilford.
The film boasts of a supporting cast with the likes of Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Tilda Swinton and Song Kang-Ho, but Chris Evans steals the show as the gritty Curtis Everett in one of his many underrated performances that are constantly overshadowed by his role as the star spangled leader of the Avengers. The movie is consistently engrossing, though the climactic scenes rise up in some sort of crescendo, particularly in terms of the narrative and the characters' back stories. 
The film also has its fair share of violence, given it revolves around a battle, but shot in the most finished and aesthetic manner - one of the trademarks of South Korean film-making.",Snowpiercer

I understand, it is a Korean director so there must be Korean actors but they had to do lot more to make movie interesting.

EI Gilliam was working for Wilfred. Anyone who believes this movie is actually about class is not paying attention, the higher up they go the more luxury they have, but the more corrupted by drugs and alcohol they become (this is not true by our standard, yes the higher up they are the more AWARE people become about another persons bad habits but in actuality the higher percentage of alcohol and drug abuse runs with lower incomes.main because the lower incomes make up a higher percentage while on this train it seems to be 2 classes, one given nothing and one given everything).The largest ""evil"" influence in the movie was Gilliam who was actually in the rear with the protagonist. To me the movie is trying to say, look outside the accepted ideals given to you by your leadership, figure your own path, think for yourself. Scientifically this movie deserves a 0/10 stars for MANY, MANY reasons. Still I found the story watchable, LOTS of plot holes, plenty to criticize but when you understand it is a piece of fiction and not trying to warn of global catastrophe, or social ineptitude, but instead of finding your own path regardless of what others have planned for you... you might appreciate it. even though in my eyes it is still a bad movie.

I don't know whether it held my interest for good reasons though...To me the movie had a lot of unnecessary/unrealistic moments. Granted the is pretty much about a man-made snow apocalypse, a lot of the parts of the movie would never happen. I think the acting is believable and the plot is pretty good. I think the movie definitely could have ended better! Everything throughout the movie was well thought out, except for the ending, it was sloppy to me. Did they honestly think that the bomb was going to blow that one door off? If they knew the bomb would cause an avalanche did they think the train wouldn't have derailed? Did they plan to just happily jump off the train and live with nothing but a giant fur coat? And after the train did crash was I suppose to assume that the boy and girl were the only two who survived? So its up to a 17 year old girl and a 5 year old boy to save and repopulate the earth with no earthly experience/knowledge of animals. One last thing, the polar bear? I understand it was supposed to show life on the frozen earth but if I had to pick who would survive. I would pick the polar bear and whatever other animals are out there before the 17 & 5 year old children.All in all, the movie kept me interested with all of its dramatic scenes, as ridiculous as some of them were.

I cannot find one redeeming quality for this movie other than hoping the railroad tracks break and the trains flies over the bridge, putting a swift end to this complete god awful movie!

Chris Evans is almost unrecognizable and when Ed Harris explains things, you almost buy it, he is so smooth. The message of Snowpiecer is simple but convoluted at the same time. This film suffered from lack of advertising. The film was shot in a Glacier /snow environment but a shot of a shirtless Chris Evans in the trailer would have given the film a boost.

The plot is ridiculous, full of holes and WTF moments. Characters are poorly written, the viewer has zero emotional connection to them, or any emotional connection to any situation that is supposed to provoke a reaction. It just fails miserably on so many aspects. Even the basic plot is utterly uninteresting, even though it had some potential, the action sequences are awfully done, yawn and giggle inducing even.

The 'plot holes' so many people seem to have taken issue with like 'oh but that's not how trains work' or 'why did they eat each other' are largely irrelevant. It's like watching King Kong and thinking 'gorillas aren't that big so why is he so big?' I don't think those who boarded the train where expecting to be met with an all you can eat buffet when the world is ending. It was probably very spontaneous and disorganised and a chaotic initial boarding. Just enjoy what you see. Not every film must be perfect with absolute logic behind every decision that the characters make. I personally enjoyed it.

I can see where the plot and the storyline were headed, but it was way too weird for me to follow. Seriously Chris Evans, really?!!Spoiler Alert!!Aside from everything else, this movie had no character development or progression in any way. At the end of this sad flick, there are quite a few strings left loose that really sealed the rotten deal. For real, how did the man in the gray suit and Wilford himself come back to life?? Also, how - better, why - did the security guards not just use bullets in the first place? Finally, I found the lady with the glasses infuriating. I wish she had been killed the second that they had the chance.I personally am not a huge fan of dystopian movies; however most I can sit through.

957,andre246-201-234685,A Well Done Allegorical Trainride,8,1 January 2015,"This is my first movie review that I've written here, or at all, for that matter. I love movies, I love watching them and I love talking about them. I've seen many reviews flunk this movie because of ""technical plot holes"" that are completely missing the point of the film. Movies, like any art form, allow a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. One wouldn't tell Salvador Dali that his paintings are 'bad' because clocks do not bend in real life, or tell Picaso that people are not made of squares and therefore his painting is meaningless. I fear this isn't the best comparison, but in a movie that takes place on a train powered by a perpetual motion device you have to tone down the technical side of your brain a bit. So I'm not going to point out technical issues or 'Why wouldn't the track break' kinds of holes, because the movie isn't about the train, the train is the setting and arguably also a plot device.Snowpiercer did what a good movie should do: it makes you think and feel while keeping you entertained and engrossed. From the very beginning we are placed into a desperate world with 99.9% of the world dead and the only life left on earth is kept alive by a train powered by an engine that will never fail or requires fuel. By the time this is revealed in the movie (About 15 minutes) I am so connected to the characters and the train they inhabit that this doesn't even strike me as odd. The set design and costuming is very detailed and well done. Everything looks worn and abused. We get the sense that these cars that our lower-class rebels occupy are essentially cattle cars.The movie is paced well and we get time to feel the tense atmosphere and have plenty of time to question why the hell the upper class citizens are acting so odd. By the time the initial strike began, you were ready to charge the line along with the protagonist. The film doesn't do much new with the camera or with effects, but it's a tight script and a good character focused movie. Acting is good for the most part, nothing academy award winning, but well done and emotional none the less.The themes and the allegory of this film is strong, and the people who point out technical impossibilities are missing the point. We, the viewers, are the upper class train riders. We are a society focused on efficiency, regulation, and profitability. This movie shows us how these traits, when taken too far and put in a self-sustaining and contained environment can turn us into monsters. Without spoiling much, we see characters become literal 'cogs in the machine' losing their humanity to fulfill their labor duties under the justification of keeping everyone else alive and to sustain the top 10% of the passengers. In order for the human race to live on in the train, mass executions and slavery are not only required, but regulated with utmost efficiency.Without being too ham-fisted, the movie addresses child labor, class disparity, exchanging humanity for efficiency/security, and the illusion of freedom and choice. I could explain where this happens in the film, but it's better to watch and pull meaning from the film on your own. It's not like it's the ending of 2001, anyone paying attention can figure out the points they are trying to make.This isn't a science fiction film like Star Trek where we have a deep and enriched universe filled with back-story. Snowpiercer is a character piece set in a science fiction setting. The train isn't the subject of the movies and serves as a plot device that the characters move through, grow, and learn some disturbing things about their fellow passengers. Both the characters and our behavior as a society and species is the subject of this movie, to which it executes on perfectly while still being entertaining and somewhat thought provoking.Tl;dr: Snowpiercer paints a detailed picture of the struggle of the oppressed fighting back against an obsessed, mathematically efficient, and inhumanly cruel leader. The themes presented in the movie are executed well thought the script and are acted out well enough to be both entertaining and thought provoking. To focus on the technical plot holes and the ""why don't the use the engine to heat a colony of humans' is missing the point of the movie all together.",Snowpiercer
958,sarahkate-rogers,Let's remember the definition of FICTION.,8,15 January 2015,"Well, I liked this the first time through, and I liked it the second time through because of some subtle hinting. I even discussed this movie with a few friends, who shared some very interesting ideas, and I'd like to just make a few points. 1. The Korean couple is father and daughter. You could call them a pair, a family, but not a couple. 2. For those of you who didn't catch the fact that Curtis tried and failed to remove his own arm after trying to eat baby Edgar, and then being stopped and seeing the err of his ways. The loss of his arm to save the child at the end was a snap judgment that both fulfilled a previous wish, and current wish. 3. My friend brought up the idea that the two weird guys where one went nuts after the other died were, perhaps, lovers. Hence the rampage. Just an interesting thought. 4. The tail section had those people because they were freeloaders. Wilford says somewhere near then somethings that imply that Curtis, like many others, are stowaways. Hence the reason the train is divided. It was completed before CW7 ruined anything alive. In the same way, the front most section of habitants had a more free society in which they could move from cart to cart, and of which they could also be removed and imprisoned. They payed, so they got privileges. 5.The girl and boy surviving are not a cliff hanger, but rather a you choose: Die or create a new humanity? The polar bear is a sign that it is warm enough for animals to survive outside, thus it is time to leave the train. 6. You people are too harsh. ""This isn't exactly like real life."" Well duh! It's a science fiction movie! It's based in 2031! No, it's not going to be 100% realistic. That's why it's FICTION. Personally, I felt like this was a pretty solid movie. There were some holes, but for the most part, they went back and covered them up with a fulfilling end to all the sub-stories. There were typical moments, and atypical moments.",Snowpiercer

I'm sorry, that was a metaphor, I didn't mean to imply an actual train was rushing past you. I am beginning to think that this review section is something of an allegory, a microcosm of humanity. and I'm the only one in the front of the train that understands that most of you dregs need to be kept in the back and occasionally purged from time to time in order for life to continue.

It is the most stupid, frustrating film which deteriorates as it goes on. I have never seen anything so ridiculous please do not watch. It starts off moderately entertaining, as a seemingly intelligent,abstract idea. However as the plot develops you start to realize how shockingly awful and unfeasible they portray the concept of the train as. Whilst the film makers could have simplified the whole idea and not gone to such lengths to appear clever and sophisticated they try and focus on many irrelevant characters who, from the camera close ups, you would think have some emotional back story connecting them to the main characters. In reality they are just more people to splatter blood all over the train in a not quite entertaining manner. The plot then gets more ridiculous and bizarre, it leads one to think that whoever was writing it gave up and left the job to a cocky ten year old to attempt to finish.

And a baby eating hero is unusual.The cigarette smoking was annoying ""Marlboro light?"", she said when he lit it up. Cant escape product placement even in the apocalypse.I was hoping for more of a backstory explaining why all these people were on the train in the first place. Did they win a lottery? Was it a 3 hour tour gone sideways? Were they hand picked by the train guy?My theory is the protein bars were really supposed to be people but they changed it to cockroaches to be less gory. Insects being ground up can't be that gross when you are starving. I had to rewind the scene to figure out what was in the grinder. At first it looked like hands and fingers. Very odd.So was Gillhams dad the creator of the chemical?I still do not understand the fish scene. Was that supposed to scare the rebels that they were gutting a fish? The fish was already dead. I guess the director liked the visual?And if only 2 people survived the crash, the whole story is moot. A train crashes in the snow, the end. I'm not getting the deep meaning they are wanting me to find. Life is just an out of control train being run by 5 year olds? You can eat babies and still be a leader?",Snowpiercer

These are absolutely undeniable. The concept is far-fetched, the execution bizarre, and the upper class characters quite comical. The key to appreciating this film is understanding its purpose. Snowpiercer is clearly a social commentary, but going into it expecting a Hunger Games sort of dystopian social commentary, you are absolutely going to find it ridiculous.Instead, a much better genre match to this film would be Brazil. Its absurdity makes it even more horrifying. The fact that there is no true logic, the contrast between the dingy tail section and the bright colors and extravagance of the front, and the utter hopelessness of the plot make this movie, yes, bizarre to watch and difficult to relate to. However, the alienation of this world from ours brings out the social commentary and the cautionary tale within.Another up-side was the diversity presented in the train and the framing of women WITHOUT the male gaze! All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film and my only real criticism is that it was way too long.",Snowpiercer
965,moonfriend,Great commentary,8,11 August 2015,"I don't know why people don't like this movie. I thought it was great, especially with the social commentary.What social commentary, you ask? Let's see: the poor are being treated like garbage (Tilda Swinton's character compares them to a shoe aka the bottom of the barrel and says that a shoe can never be a hat), the rich have all the stuff they need and way more (like the 1% of the US), and the rich say that the reason for that is because everyone has their place in the world.The children being part of the engine was both horrifying and symbolic. How symbolic? Think about it: as poor adults get older and die off, it's their children that will continue to work for the rich.But the most terrifying part was the classroom. I was squirming in my seat when I watched that because I felt like I was watching an initiation into a cult, which was probably the point. The teacher was overly happy, the children were eating up her lessons like they were cake, and there were chanting and hand movements that seemed to be drilling in the ""lesson of the day."" Overall, people should really cut this movie some slack and see it for what it is: a good sci-fi movie that shows social inequality.

966,thepatienceofbooks,People...it's allegorical,9,23 August 2015,"I don't usually write reviews. My only claim in being the ""film- type"" is that I am an audience member. Which I suppose is the purpose of creating film, or art of any type; one distributes creations to reach an audience, and among that audience are ""critics"" and ""laypeople"". I am the latter.The only reason I'm writing this review is because I saw several overtly negative reviews regarding plot holes and absurdities. While I agree that anything that disturbs the plausible suspension of disbelief is a problem, the issue in this case resides in audiences not fine-tuned for allegorical material. Subtly allegorical material is easier to absorb as its focus is on credibility, with a secondary (or tertiary, etc.) focus on subtext. Full allegories are more difficult, as they bring subtext nearly to the surface, with only a thin veneer of story over it, challenging our ability to suspend disbelief. But when we read ""Animal Farm"" we know it's completely unrealistic for a pig to talk or read, or for animals to incite organized revolution. But we accept it as pretense because it's an allegory, and by definition, thinly-veiled.To those who haven't seen this film yet: when you watch it, watch it as the allegory it is. I'm not suggesting you shouldn't notice plot- holes, confusing items, or mistakes (as any intelligent viewer should), I'm only suggesting you take a second look at anything that confuses you, or ""seems weird"", and question if there may be other reasons for it. It may not make sense in a ""real world"" perspective (as real as fiction can be), but take a second look and determine what it's supposed to represent. A talking pig is absurd, but pay attention to what the pig is saying and doing, and find real-world corollaries. If you watch this film with that paradigm-shift in mind, it is far more enjoyable and intriguing.To those who have seen it and didn't like it or get it: please try watching it again, this time aligning your perception of reality at a different angle. It's not actually about the first-order expectations of a dystopian survival situation...on a train. That's the veneer, boiling down the human existence to a narrow population on that circling train. The Sacred Engine is not a a physical engine. The actions of individuals on the train are not individual actions -- as absurd as they can seem, they are the stand-ins for the actions of the mob, and the mob is fickle and illogical.Allegory is meant to be dissected, but please resist trying to dissect the ""realistic"" from the ""unrealistic"". That quickly degenerates into absurdity and the story loses all meaning.This is a beautiful film, not perfect but excellent. It's well-paced (starts slowly, increasing speed and tempo with a deft and smooth hand), with beautiful cinematography, excellent shots, well- developed ""characters"", and above-par acting. To take this graphic novel to film is ambitious and difficult, and Bong Joon-ho does so with exceptional skill. It's well worth watching, even owning, but only if the audience is willing to shift perception and accept ""unreal"" as ""real enough"", a difficult prospect, but worth the effort.",Snowpiercer

969,kseniakubrina,A very so-so movie + good acting,5,21 January 2020,"A movie theater nearby just decided to show this again on big screen, so I watched it.
I don't know if any of those who made excited comments back in 2014 changed their minds with time or even rewatched it at all, but I'm sure some of them did change their opiniong about it, because this movie was probably a bit outdated when it came out, and is just glaringly outdated today, in terms of how much the viewers are supposed to just take in without questioning.
I understand it's an allegory. The point is that it's quite a transparent one, and it doesn't cover up all the plotholes and world-building faults.
My main question was: why the hell do they need all those ""back sectioners"" again? To... make a riot once in a while to regulate the population? Eeh? That seems so... stupid. For the most part it seems these poor people are there just to be tortured and for no other reason. But no one even seems to enjoy that (i.e. like in Hunger Games, a show), except for some very merciless killers that are somehow of course on board and in multiples.
Exclusively 5-year-olds can do some work to keep the machine working? What again? Why? How do they maintain 5-year old kids as ""spare parts"", they are not mechanic, not efficient, how do they even train them, it's just impossible.
The ""unkillable"" man was just the worst movie trope. Annoying.
And finally ... what the hell is the end of that movie? Those surviving passengers (if any remained, except for a girl and a boy) are sure to die: nothing grows on the land, it's still all covered with snow, there's just one polar bear in sight - how are they even going to reach some water or something, if there's supposedly some - assuming the bear needs fish? And if they do, what, they will just eat fish forever? And then, just the two of them - what? Happily die free in the snow?
I don't undrstand the message, honestly. It seems just a gloomy postapocalyptic no-happy-end-much-useless-murder story to me.But the acting is good. I honestly did not recognise Tilda Swinton for quite a while in this role. So it's not a total loss of time.",Snowpiercer

973,elizabethnyolich,Dooms Day Dispositions,4,24 April 2016,"**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***Joon Ho Bong's 2013 film, Snowpiercer is a drama, action, and sci-fi film that centers around life in a post-climate change disaster. Unlike other dooms day films that have become popular within the last decade or so, Snowpiercer takes a familiar story line and gives it a unique spin. With conventions from a variety of genres combined, the acclaimed film shows us that tragedy often has an underlying destiny.Curtis (Chris Evans) has lived for 17 years on the tail end of an industrialized and specialized Wilford Engine. He and his car mates are supposed to consider themselves lucky, seeing that they were the select precious few left to survive humanity. As the train he calls home circles around the world, the righteous and daring Curtis devises a plan with his right-wing man, Edgar. Casted to the lowest class of the train, Curtis and Edgar attempt to fight their way to the top and test not only the barricades of authority, but also the boundaries of predisposition. After the world has essentially ended, Curtis and the others have no capacity for decision. Their planet as they once knew it is now covered by layers of life threatening ice and snow, so what is there to do? That sense of helplessness that exudes from the characters makes the audience question themselves the same: what is there to do? Settle for contempt by eating protein blocks and hoping you're not the next victim chosen to ""control the population""? Not only are all the survivors on the train literally trapped inside the hierarchy- being controlled by someone higher than them- but they are also left with no sense of hope because of the dead world surrounding them. Curtis and the others have lived through the end of the world because that was their fate. All the train passengers strictly stick to their car, level of class, and assigned jobs because that is there predisposition. Conductor Wilford explains to Curtis, ""Everyone has their preordained disposition, and everyone is in their place except for you."" As Curtis fights his way to the top, he is not only breaking the boundaries of social class, but he is also fighting his way into his own destiny.",Snowpiercer
974,martinez-47327,Snowpiercer,9,25 April 2016,"A film by Bong Joon-ho's, Snowpiercer was based in 2031. The whole world is frozen, but the unstoppable train, the Snowpiercer. On board, the front of the train were lavish living people, as opposed to the back half, lacking real food, water to wash themselves with, darkness etc. Curtis, the main character, has a plan with all the others at the end of the train to make their way to the front of the train to speak to Wilford. While this happens, it is interesting watching them go towards the front and what is seen in each section. For example, they went through a couple doors and you just watch the scene change as they pass through the doors. The viewer watches the dark and dirty end of the train, to a lavish lifestyle. The way Bong Joon-ho's filming was done was great, we as the viewer somewhat see what the characters/actors see. For instance when it went all black in the tunnel. We looked at the fighting through the night goggles. I also thought it was interesting/ironic that they had a school section. Since they cannot get out of the train, what are they learning for? They pass a couple more parts of the train and the adults are having what seems to be a rave like party with drugs and steaming in saunas. I have to say, this was one of the best films I have seen in a while. From watching how everyone in the end of the train were getting mistreated and living in the low class, you almost want to help them fight because this film definitely gives you some adrenaline. This film also made me question why they were able to live on the train and be the ""lucky ones"" but they could not live the lavish lifestyle everyone else was living. I would definitely recommend this film!",Snowpiercer
975,mckennacryan,Snowpiercer,6,25 April 2016,"Spoiler Alert Bong Joon-ho's film the Snowpiercer is set in the year 2031 with the world at a freeze. It consists of as some may say are the chosen ones aboard the train. The film shows an exquisite display of a caste system throughout its entirety that sets the tone and the plot. The film focuses on main character Curtis Everett, a curious passenger at the end of the caste system, which is portrayed through the movie as the dark and crowded back of the train. Everett and other passengers revolt. Everett is eventually put in charge and challenges the caste system and all the obstacles given when going from train cart to train cart. Eventually Everett and the remaining crew make it to higher level of the train cart which appear bright and full of high quality amenities that were not offered to those in the back train carts. Bong Joon-ho uses lighting that displays the caste system perfectly. The scenes with the ""chosen ones"" are dark and dirty, which depicts how they are seen through the eyes of the higher levels. When we start to see the trains closer to the front of the train light begins to show and each train gets brighter and brighter showing how those in the upper part of the train are portrayed. A perfect example is the school train and its bright yellow walls and cheery teacher, who preaches about the inventor of the train and how he did everyone a favor. The way the train is set up is similar to a pyramid in a way that the back end of the train is the same as the bottom of a pyramid, less important and so on and so forth. Bong Joon-ho does an excellent job at demonstrating a caste system without specifically stating the obvious. He also gives me an idea of what society can come to.",Snowpiercer
976,wallikazi,Bringing sci-fi back to its roots,8,30 April 2016,"Sci-fi movies used to be films filled with wild and crazy scenes, such as the three breasted lady in ""Total Recall"", or Princess Leia dressed in scantily clad clothing dancing for Jabba the Hutt. The viewer never broke these scenes down and analyzed them frame by frame. All the negative reviews that snowpiercer has seemed to generate are because critics are questioning every little detail. Why are there cockroaches on the train? How does one create and power a perpetual engine? Snowpiercer is a movie ridden with plot holes and that's a given. However it is a sci-fi and like all great sci-fi movies you cannot get nitty gritty with the movie. If you intend on watching this movie, don't let the negative reviews urge you away from it. Rather go in knowing that there are many minuscule details that are brushed aside or looked over, and also keep a large suspension of disbelief. All in all this is a great movie that tries to offer the viewer with a lot, and it will leave you thinking about it for days.",Snowpiercer

979,kolt-28101,"For most of the 1 star reviewers, this is their only review.",9,23 June 2016,"Let's get this out of the way. Yes, this is my first review. I've watched about half of IMDb's top 250, and did like most of them. Somebody brought this movie to my attention, and as a 7/10 I didn't have high expectations. Honestly, though, knowing this is at least an attempt at some sort of allegory, most of the plot holes are kind of petty and minor. Comparing Snowpiercer to ""The Room"" (don't watch that) because you couldn't tell how someone would have an Irish accent, or realized that the premise of this movie is brutal and inconvenient - is kind of realizing the problem with 99% of all movies altogether.For anyone brutally bothered about plot holes, tell me, is The Hunger Games more logical? Ant-man? Even Inception, the Dark Knight, or Lord Of The Rings? You can't blame a movie for plot holes, rate it a 1, and then ignore those same plot holes in every other movie in existence. By that token, any and all of the Star Wars movies should be rated a 2.No. People here are nitpicking, and that's a nice way to put it. You don't know how the cockroaches kept spawning? Jesus, maybe they breed fast. I have no idea. But then you should point out that Yoda's aches and pains should have technically kept him out of commission years ago, Jack Sparrow should be dead, Captain America has no sources for his morals, Harry Potter makes no sense, and any and all plot holes about Mordor that you can find online.But do they? Nope. Most of the negative reviews here are a one-show, leading me to think there's someone with multiple accounts and a large amount of time to hate this movie.I've seen quite a few sci-fi films - I'm no newbie to the genre. But their are always plot holes in those films, at least technical ones. Faulting Snowpiercer (an allegory, of all things) for having plot holes that are granted in other movies is just not right.",Snowpiercer
980,zjoyeuse,Needs More Science and Less Fiction,4,4 September 2016,"In a Marxist take on The Polar Express, Snowpiercer boldly ventures where many science fiction films have gone before: right into the shitter. Granted, it has all the elements of a blockbuster firm: a large budget ($40 million), a believable plot (in an overcompensation for global warming, mankind inadvertently causes another ice age), an A-list cast (the film stars Chris Evans, known to many as Captain America), and fantastic special effects. While impressive on paper, the execution of the film falls flat in comparison to what it could, and perhaps should, have been.The premise behind the film is this: 16 years ago, in 2014, the world was encased in a perpetual winter due to a misguided attempt to end global warming, a la the Jimmy Neutron episode that aired in 2002. However, rather than solving the problem as Jimmy and his comically-animated friends do, Snowpiercer traps all of the remaining inhabitants on Earth inside a steam train powered by an impossible-to-create-due-to-entropy perpetual motion machine. For a film that seeks to be ""science"" first and ""fiction"" second, perhaps the director could have spent about $10 of their $40 million budget and asked any high school senior in an AP Physics class what the First Law of Thermodynamics is.The inhabitants train in which the movie takes place, known as the Rattling Ark, firmly believe they are a perfect microcosm of humanity. To that end, the film is successful. The director must have asked himself, ""what makes mankind, mankind?"" because what he created fits the bill, assuming you're the premier of Soviet Russia. Social stratification is the main theme of the movie, placing the lowest class in the back of the train under the guidance of a wise spiritual leader (who once was on par with the conductor but had a falling out akin to Trotsky and Stalin). The poor proletariats, who did not pay for a ticket on the train but were rather let on out of the good will of the conductor, feel entitled to all the spoils of the train's ""bourgeois"" inhabitants. A revolt starts by Curtis Everett, played by Christ Evans, and the rest of the film follows the revolution's challenges and successes until Curtis, and Curtis alone, reaches the control room.I will not ruin the details of the ending of the movie, and if you revel in disappointment, stop reading now. However, If you want to save yourself two hours of anticipation and ten minutes of impotent rage, please continue. If there ever was a movie that seeks to give catharsis to the viewers only to, incidentally or not, brutally rip it away, this is the one. In short, child labor leads Everett to decide, essentially, that he would rather single-handedly cause the destruction of the human race than allow a handful of children to work to keep the Rattling Ark functioning properly. The end of the movie is a train wreck. I mean this in both the strictest and loosest sense of the word: not only is the ending the single worst part of the whole film, the train actually derails, killing every single inhabitant on board save for a drug-addicted Korean girl named Yona and a child named Timmy. In the end, we see a polar bear, which is supposed to signal that life can miraculously continue in this harsh environment. However, with two living survivors are not adults and are nowhere near the age of sexual maturity. How are two adolescents supposed to cary on the banner of the human race and repopulate the world when the only food is a single polar bear, and how are they not to freeze to death if the only creature adapted enough to survive lives in the arctic year round and eats penguins? Are Yona and Timmy supposed to hunt down a greater that weighs five times their weight, combined? If we extrapolate this ending to even a month in the future, it's not hard to imagine Yona and Timmy become the equivalent of a human popsicle, frozen solid in their icy hell. Perhaps in the future, the director will make a sequel with an even more plausible plot that has extraterrestrials unthawing them and using the two as beasts of burden to replant humanity on another planet. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if the two get eaten by the wampa ice monster while they're wandering in the tundra because, judging by the climate, we must be on Hoth. If I saw the director in a bar, I'd order him a Moscow mule because, like the USSR, his film is a cautionary tale of what happens when you try to address a problem you simply don't understand.",Snowpiercer

I'm not going to lie, the words post-apocalyptic usually make me want to skip a movie and combined with A-list stars, it would have been a hard pass if it hadn't been for the director.It's easy to complain that the premise is absurd but if you're going to complain about the science and plausibility in films set in the future, don't watch them. The themes explored in this film never become preachy, partly because the director doesn't judge the characters in his films, he leaves that up to the audience and party because of Bong's trademark dark humourThe performances are superb. Chris Evans is allowed to showcase his acting talent rather than his muscles, Song Kang-ho turns in his usual restrained performance, ably supported by Go Ah-sung who is always charming.

I stood for a good couple of minutes in complete disappointment.But rewinding all the illogical moments of the movie, it started to make sense.
My perception was that this movie was telling a story. It was not. If one abstracts himself, this movie actually describes a picture, not a story. Two pictures to be more precise.The train is not a train at all, its a description of the human engine that we all ride in each day of our lives. Going very fast, on a bumpy ride, yet going nowhere. At its back are the lowest classes, hungry and suffering, oppressed by rules that they don't fully understand, fighting to get a better life, not knowing what that means. Its a pure description of the jihad movements, and not only. After them are the outcasts, people, like Snowden, who rebelled against the engine. The disgusting food production factories. For a reason there is a vegan movement. The trump card, water section, that is not a trump card at all. The empty 'battlefield' section, that has no reason to exist on a train like this. The night vision, superior technology, should have ended the battle in an instant. Yet in real life, battles are fought over large periods of time and there are ways to counteract higher technologies. The few ones that pass the 'battlefield' face the hidden 'weapons and agencies'. The twisted education system, the oblivious casual workers and even more oblivious 'rest or party' sections. The inhuman locomotive that barely works. The 'people who are to be blamed', I.E. politicians and higher ups, who actually do more or less what is necessary to sustain the locomotive, losing parts of their humanity in the process. If one pictures all this, its a complete picture of the human engine that is our lives.The second picture is after crash. Not everyone will die when the engine breaks. And no matter how much humanity has screwed up nature, life will go on. We'll be the ones that might not continue to live.I think that this is brilliant, but the movie is not clear about it. Many, as it can be seen in the reviews, did not realise the purpose of the 'story'.Another movie with brilliant idea, but bad execution. Worth the watch, but nothing more.",Snowpiercer

1004,Eric_8,"Lame, weak and predictable",3,30 March 2014,"I believed the ratings it had and being a Sci-Fi fan I was excited about this film. The plot seemed OK but soon after starting watching it I realized it was already going in the wrong direction. I've read 1984, Animal farm and so on (as mentioned by some people that liked this film), and I love all those books. However, I think this film is a total waste of time. I also like a lot Asian films, Japanese, Korean... but still, this film is weak, lame and not worth your time. Predictable actions, incongruent characters and several plot holes that are borderline stupid, as it is the end of the film. You'll be disappointed, utterly disappointed. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.",Snowpiercer
