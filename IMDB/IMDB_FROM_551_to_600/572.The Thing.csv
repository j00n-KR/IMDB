0,Leofwine_draca,"Inferior, albeit mildly entertaining, prequel",6,18 September 2012,"This movie, billed as a prelude to the John Carpenter original telling the story of the Norwegian camp seen at the beginning of that film, was bound to struggle from the start. Although technically it's a prequel, it feels much more like a remake of the Carpenter movie, albeit with a few twists here and there to differentiate it. As most movie fans will tell you, the Carpenter movie is an outstanding piece of filmmaking, and I don't think anybody can ever hope to equal it. 2011's THE THING doesn't even come close.Saying that, this film is not without merit. As a stand-alone film, it's actually pretty decent: well paced and fairly disturbing in places. It goes without saying that it would be a lot better if the original movie didn't exist; I'm sure some would be hailing it as a modern day classic. Those familiar with the Carpenter movie will be under no illusions about just how derivative this is.Still, THE THING utilises some excellent CGI effects work (for the most part) that brings the body-horror storyline to vivid life; a crucial set-piece that takes place towards the climax is grim, gruesome and chilling in equal measure. However, it's perhaps a little bit too explicit and fast-paced; there are monster encounters galore and constant action, whereas a more subtle approach layered with tension and paranoia would have been more effective.The cast don't get much of a look in, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead displays the same level of blandness as I've seen from her other movies; you just can't remember her face once the film finishes. Also, things get a little too science-fictiony at the climax, which goes all out and loses some believability as a result. Had they remained more restrained, the end result would have been much more realistic – and frightening.",The Thing
1,SnoopyStyle,"drop the CG, eliminate the saucer, and bring back the blood",6,18 August 2013,"This is a prequel/sequel/reboot/rework to John Carpenter's 1982 classic horror The Thing. There is the big reveal twisting the story to loop it around. They could have played with this a lot more than what they actually did. It's convoluted but I'm willing to buy it. In fact, it added something interesting. Not the same for the FX.The aliens are now almost all CG. That's a big problem since the original had some of the most iconic real FX. It's a spit in the face for fans to replace it with CGI and it doesn't look good anyways. Going inside the saucer is a big mistake. This stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Eric Christian Olsen, but nobody really stands out. This is a good idea but executed without understanding the appeal of the original.",The Thing
2,claudio_carvalho,A Remake Disguised in Prequel but Without the Tension of John Carpenter's Masterpiece,6,9 July 2013,"In 1982, the Norwegian Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) invites the paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to join his team in his research in the Artic. On the arrival, she learns that they have discovered a spacecraft deep below in the ice. They find a frozen alien life form nearby and they bring to their facility for research. Out of the blue, the alien revives and attack the scientists, contaminating them and assuming the shape of his victim. Kate finds means to identify the creature, but maybe it is too late to save the team members. In 1982, the master John Carpenter remade the 1951 ""The Thing from Another World"" ans his movie has become a masterpiece. The story of a shape-shifting alien that can assume any human form is tense, supported by a claustrophobic and depressing scenario, paranoid characters with Kurt Russell in the top of his successful career, haunting music score by Ennio Morricone and John Carpenter's top-notch direction. This remake disguised in prequel is not totally bad, but follows the format of the present Hollywood movies, supported by special effects but without the atmosphere and the psychological horror of the 1982 movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Enigma do Outro Mundo"" (""The Enigma of Another World"")",The Thing
3,nogodnomasters,I don't want to be killed because I floss.,8,21 June 2019,"A group of Norwegians discover and abyss, the hard way and need a person who specializes in frozen dead things. Enter Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is introduced while listening to ""Men at Work.""As it turns out, this is just another alien spacecraft and there is a frozen alien in ice. The proverbial storm is on the way. A bit like ""Alien Hunter.""The ""scientific"" aspect was better than previous films. No one films the world's first alien autopsy. The cells as viewed under a microscope was very primitive special effects, apparently they had blown their $8 million budget when it came time to create that scene and resorted to drawing pictures on cards and flipping them real fast. The rest of the special ""Re-animator"" type effects were fairly decent. Good one to see.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity",The Thing
4,kosmasp,Prequel to a Remake,7,10 March 2012,"The original (and the Remake) are kind of untouchable. So the producers thought they'd try to make an Origin story. Which of course will be not really surprising to those who know one of the other movies. It also seems to be almost a blueprint copy of what happens in the other movies too. But that doesn't take too much away from the movie. The actors sell it beautifully.Of course puritans still won't like it, because how could you make a movie like that, that plays before the 80s Thing and have the effects be newer then that? Also what about how to spot ""the Thing""? Will there be a new way and why wouldn't they use the same thing in the ""sequel"" (aka Original/Remake from the 80s)?! If you don't mind those minor (for me) things, you will enjoy the movie. You can see they did their best with this",The Thing
5,jboothmillard,The Thing,8,5 November 2014,"I heard little bits and pieces about the remake of the 1982 John Carpenter classic horror, including that it was also meant as a prequel to the original, and with good ratings by critics I was looking forward to seeing how it would fare. Basically in 1982, beneath the Antarctic ice, an alien spacecraft has been discovered by a Norwegian research team: Edvard Wolner (Trond Espen Seim), Jonas (Kristofer Hivju), Olav (Jan Gunnar Røise), Karl (Carsten Bjørnlund), Juliette (Kim Bubbs), Lars (Jørgen Langhelle), Henrik (Jo Adrian Haavind), Colin (Jonathan Lloyd Walker) and Peder (Stig Henrik Hoff). Dr. Sander Halvorson (Festen's Ulrich Thomsen) and his assistant Adam Finch (Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd's Eric Christian Olsen) recruit paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Final Destination 3's Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to investigate the discovery, along with Sam Carter (The Great Gatsby's Joel Edgerton), Derek Jameson (Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Griggs (Paul Braunstein) they travel in helicopter to the Norwegian base. The scientists are told by the group that while viewing the spacecraft and alien body was recovered from the crash buried under the ice, the body is brought to the base in an ice block, but that evening, while the team celebrate the find, Derek sees the alien break out from the ice and escape the building. Searching for the creature they find it has killed Lars' dog, Olav and Henrik find the alien, which grabs and engulf Henrik, the rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature with a flamethrower, killing both it and Henrik, but a blood sample from the dead creature reveals its cells are still alive, and replicating Henrik's. Derek, Carter, Griggs and Olav go to seek help in the helicopter, taking off before Kate finds bloody dental fillings and tries to warn them, Griggs is the Thing and it attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to crash in the mountains, the team agree to evacuate, but Kate theorises that the creature can imitate anyone of them, all but dental fillings that are non-biological, the creature may have done so already. While getting the keys to stop anyone leaving Juliette transforms and attacks Kate, Karl is consumed by the creature, and it appears to be gone after being burned by Lars, then Derek and Carter return, the team refuse to believe they could have survived the crash, so they plan to conduct a test, bu the laboratory is sabotaged, so instead Kate inspects all their teeth, singling out those without inorganic metal fillings: Sander, Edvard, Adam and Colin. Carter and Derek escape isolation before they can tested, when they are caught Edvard orders Peder to burn them, but Derek shoots him with a gun several times and causes the flamethrower fuel tank to ignite, Edvard is knocked out, he is the one who transforms, infecting Jonas and Jameson before assimilating Adam, Jonas and Derek end up torched, and Sander is infected as Kate and Carter pursue the Thing, which has fused Edvard and Adam, Carter is cornered by it, but Kate burns it with the flamethrower. Sander drives off into the blizzard, with Carter and Kate pursuing, they arrive at the now activated alien spacecraft, the creature briefly uses Sander's face, Kate destroys it with a grenade which also damages the ship, but it is not over as returning to the vehicle Kate deduces Carter is a Thing as he is missing an earring, she burns him, it fades to black as Kate stares at the burning spaceship and vast tundra. The next morning helicopter pilot Matius (Ole Martin Aune Nilsen) arrives and sees the burned remains of one of the versions of the creature in the snow, Lars appears and orders him at gunpoint to show his dental fillings to prove he is human, then Lars' deceased dog runs out of the camp, it's the Thing, the two in the helicopter and Lars fires his rifle to kill it. I personally cannot see anything to suggest that this is a prequel to the original, especially not with the ending, but it doesn't matter, it keeps to the same setup as the good cast become paranoid and one by one fall victim to the alien taking over their bodies, it may use CGI effects whereas the original used real life puppetry effects, but they are brilliant to watch, as well as grotesque, this definitely delivers the goods and is a fantastic horror film. Very good!",The Thing
6,ma-cortes,Scientists in the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills.,6,20 October 2012,"Monster movie in which an alien menaces an isolated scientific community . The producers convinced Universal Studios to allow them to create a prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing instead of a remake, as they felt Carpenter's film was already perfect . Directed by Dutch Matthijs van Heijningen in his first film , the thriller is produced by Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman (Dawn of the Dead). However, the prequel still has the title of the original film, because they couldn't think of a subtitle that sounded good . It is set in Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty. It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien is unearthed by a crew of international scientists . It deals with a lonely group of scientists (Ulrich Thomsen as Dr. Sander Halvorson , Eric Christian Olsen as Adam Finch , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Derek Jameson) who take on the most dangerous creature of universe. The shape-shifting creature , accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being. It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. In the thriller The Thing , paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet. Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead and in order to not try to compete with Kurt Russell's portrayal of the 1982 film's protagonist, R.J. MacReady, the character of Kate Lloyd was designed to have traits in common with the character Ellen Ripley from the Alien film series) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime and she is studying a thawing cave bear (Ursus Spelaeus). Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago. But it is about to wake up. When a simple experiment frees the alien from its frozen prison, Kate must join the crew's pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to keep it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish. Acceptable and estimable action/thriller professionally directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. who provides a punchy suspenseful Sci-Fi . However , the filmmaker copies several scenes from Carpenter movie , in fact an enormous amount of screen shots from the first movie were kept on the set while filming at all times, in order to ensure that the Norwegian station would be rebuilt to the smallest details. The Thing serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name that is one of the great Sci-Fi classics . The gradual built-up suspense is quite superb as when the monster is shown largely to create a real menace , though some moments looks and feels just like a remake of ¨Alien¨. This exciting film packs chills , thrills , guessing , paranoia , absence of all characterization , spectacular FX , including a loathing chest-burning scene . It takes a liberal stand in exposing the tension of men when confronted with an alien . Based on the short story titled ""Who Goes There?"" by John Campbell Jr , published in 1938 , the screen-writer Eric Heisserer rejects out the hand the idea that the alien might be worth attempting to understand or communicate with research team . Thrilling and intriguing musical score by Marco Beltrani . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Abramowicz . ¨The thing¨ produced Marc Abraham J. Miles Dale , David Foster , Eric Newman and Lawrence Turman emerges as distinctly Sci-Fi/terror movie and one might be recommending for its FX , masterfully made by Tom Woodruff Jr and Alec Gillis for creature effects and special makeup . The creature effects were done primarily with cable-operated animatronic robots on the director's insistence, since it would improve the performances of the cast if they saw what they had to react to. Computer-generated images were used to add elements to the animatronics such as tentacles , or in some cases, to replace the entire animatronic if it didn't behave convincingly. The earlier first version results to be ¨The Thing from another world¨ by Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks with Kenneth Tobey , Margaret Sheridan and James Arness as the monster ; it holds a subtle but efficient intrigue . The best version by John Carpenter was starred by Kurt Russell and an all-star-secondary cast as Wilford Brimley , T.K. Carter , David Clennon , Keith David , Richard Dysart , Charles Hallahan , Peter Maloney , Richard Masur and Donald Moffat . The modern version is this ¨The Thing (2011)¨ by Mattijs Heijmingen resulting to be inferior to previous but still being acceptable .",The Thing
7,BA_Harrison,"A flawed prequel, but lots of fun nonetheless.",8,12 December 2011,"I had my reservations about this belated prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing, mostly about the decision to make the lead role a woman and the predictable use of CGI for the effects. As it happens, I needn't have been all that concerned about either matter: Mary Elizabeth Winstead capably pulls off her 'Ripley-lite' role, and the digital trickery is about as good as one could hope for. As big budget, gory sci-fi horror goes, the film is actually a very entertaining experience, director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. effectively building a sense of paranoia and distrust, while also delivering some well executed scenes of mayhem.As much as I liked the film, though, I still have some nagging doubts regarding certain plot elements—things that didn't exactly ruin my overall enjoyment, but which I felt could and should have been addressed before filming commenced.For example, a crucial plot development shows the alien unable to replicate inorganic matter, and yet when a victim is assimilated, the 'clone' always appears fully clothed. Are we supposed to believe that after an attack the creature goes looking for an identical outfit to slip into? Or does it somehow have the victim's own clothes mended and cleaned to remove any sign of blood, mucous or tentacle puncture wounds before putting them on? (I know we're shown someone being replicated internally via the mouth, which might leave the clothes stain-free, but the alien's most popular modus operandi—tentacular impalement—is pretty damn messy).And then, of course, there's the small matter of a crashed spacecraft being fully functional after 100,000 years trapped under ice, and the rather dumb ear-ring plot-device (did anyone NOT notice Carter's ear piercing glinting in the foreground and think to themselves 'Hey, I bet that'll be used to give Kate a clue as to whether he's human or not""?).While none of these issues are deal-breakers by any means, and could possibly even be explained away with some carefully considered reasoning, I found it a little frustrating that so much effort had gone into integrating the story with Carpenter's film, developing the tense atmosphere of the piece, and generating the impressive alien, and yet they still didn't satisfactorily iron out these unnecessary 'wrinkles' in the plot.I rate The Thing 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb—the same as I gave Carpenter's film (I know my opinion isn't a popular one, but I never found it to be the masterpiece many claim it to be); in my mind, that still makes Howard Hawks' version of John W. Campbell's 'The Thing from Another World' the superior movie adaptation so far.",The Thing
8,paul_haakonsen,It wasn't actually all that bad...,6,24 November 2011,"Initially I had thought this to be yet another of the countless Hollywood remakes, and I was thrilled to find out that it was not so. Being a prequel, this movie definitely had something to live up to, as Carpenter's original version is nothing short of a masterpiece.This 2011 prequel actually did a good job, and I think it was a good addition to Carpenter's work.What impressed me was the creature effects. The effects team really had managed to put together something unique here. And there was really a sense of something not-of-this-world about the grotesque shapes and abnormalities the creature assumed. And best of all was that the effects and make-up all looked so life-like and real.The acting in the movie was good, and I think it was a really great touch that they had put together a mix of American, Danish and Norwegian actors/actresses. And the best part was that people actually did speak Danish and Norwegian, and not just English with a Scandinavian imitated accent, as you tend to see in American movies. So thumbs up on this detail.As in the original Carpenter movie, they really had caught the feeling of isolation and paranoia in this 2011 movie as well. However, it was a shame that there really wasn't anything new or innovating to be told from the story here. It was a bit like they were just making soup off the broth Carpenter already used back in the day.However, all in all, ""The Thing"" (2011) actually did entertain me thoroughly and I think it was a good enough prequel in its own way. Just don't expect something overly new here.",The Thing
9,Quinoa1984,"at its best it's just lame, at it's worst it's an insult to horror fans and especially John Carpenter fans",4,18 October 2011,"Like Skyline last year, I was thinking for the most part 'eh, pretty lame and generic, and not scary, and the CGI sucks, but it's not an awful movie'... until the last few minutes, which just made me want to just throw drek at the screen. ARGH! What a BS way of trying to tie together this prequel - which is a blatant lie as it's just a remake - with the John Carpenter film. Hey, movie, how about interesting characters, some strong stakes, or actually making the paranoia stick by showing just a little of the process of the copying of the 'Thing' so that we're not totally confused about how this all spreads? Carpenter had the smarts - and the guts - to reveal the process with a dog to start with. Now there's just... I really don't know. Aside from Winstead's character, who mostly just spouts as the voice of reason and looks on in some minor shock and awe (and luckily is beautiful enough to hold my attention... for a while), nobody is a real person, so why care when they start getting picked off one by one? So what else is there - the special effects, which are cheesy and just boring. It would be lame on its own terms... but then when looking at it being as in the same 'world' as the Carpenter film, which featured Rob Bottin's masterpiece work, it's just insulting. Why not try and meet up to those standards, instead of falling much beneath them. I could have laughed if I wasn't just so taken aback at all of these spider-human creatures that are equally shocking coming from the VFX company behind the better-than-decent effects in District 9. It becomes close to painful to watch these poor excuses for creatures, and ultimately the film made me want to rush home to watch the ""original"" (must use quotes as to not confuse with Howard Hawks' original from 1951) just so I could get the bad taste of this hack job out of the way. And if you haven't seen the Carpenter film... it's still not good, on the general standards of suspense, action, logic, and giving some kind of awe (i.e. the spaceship itself under the ice).",The Thing
10,Coventry,To have fillings or not to have fillings? That's the question...,6,26 November 2013,"Prequel, sequel or whatever they want to call it, the most positive comment I can give to ""The Thing"" is that it sparked my desire to re-watch John Carpenter's 1982 original and perhaps even the almighty 1951 pioneer classic ""The Thing from another World"", just so I can spot the little connections and audit if everything – in fact - interweaves nicely together. I've read quite a lot of harsh and severely impolite reviews on this film, but personally I must say I enjoyed it very much. Admittedly, however, I might be a bit prejudiced one two specific levels, namely a) I do not worship the Carpenter milestone like many fellow genre lovers do. It's a terrific and very influential classic, of course, but I don't consider it sacred and wouldn't rank it in my personal top 10 or so. And b) I'm a Belgian who spends a lot of time in The Netherlands. What does that have to do with anything, I hear you say? Well, not much indeed, except for the fact that ""The Thing"" was the directorial debut of Dutch filmmaker Matthijs Van Heijningen Jr., and if you'd know how many Belgian and/or Dutch directors aspire to build up careers in Hollywood, yet how very few of them ever even come close, this is praiseworthy to say the least. Van Heijningen literally came out of nowhere and all of a sudden now directs a relatively large-budgeted Sci-Fi horror flick with a massive reputation and a cast full of fairly famous faces. His father may have earned quite some money producing famous Dutch flicks, but this is nevertheless an impressive and respectable accomplishment.""The Thing"" 2011 is a fast-paced and visually astonishing, albeit unsurprising Sci-Fi/horror shocker. I state unsurprising because the film follows the exact same narrative structure and introduces very similar characters as in John Carpenter's original, which makes this nonetheless some kind of crossover between a prequel and a remake. Norwegian expedition members stumble upon a gigantic spacecraft underneath the thick ice of Antarctica and even discover a deep-frozen alien specimen within the same perimeter. Expedition leader Dr. Halvorson recruits American paleontologist Kate Lloyd to investigate the remains, but he clearly has a hidden agenda and wants to keep the discovery as confidential as possible for reasons of profitability. Whilst under observation, the alien naturally thaws and promptly goes on an unstoppable annihilation rampage thanks to his unique ability to duplicate the people it already killed. The one essential aspect this version lacks is undoubtedly the atmosphere of paranoia and hostility. Once the alien's hunting methods are known, there's general distrust and fear between the characters that isn't illustrated as tense as in Carpenter's film. There's a sequence in which Dr. Lloyd demands that everyone opens their mouth to check if they have teeth fillings, simply because the alien is unable to reproduce artificial body corrections. This particular sequence is a bit suspenseful, but simultaneously overlong and somewhat silly, because – like one of the group members righteously remarks – people suddenly can get banned from the circle ""because they floss"". On a more positive note ""The Thing"" definitely outshines the vast majority of other horror releases nowadays, thanks to the presence of authentic characters instead of irritating genre stereotypes... Of course, it would have been quite impossible to cast scantily clad babes and dim-witted jocks as arctic explorers... Also, the 1982 film may have benefited tremendously from Ennio Morricone's musical guidance, but Marco Beltrami provides a new score that is nearly as intense. But the biggest trump of ""The Thing"", and probably the main reason to grant it at least one viewing, is the gore. Even though all the special effects and make-up is computer engineered, Van Heijningen Jr. and his crew succeeded in making the special effects look as raw and disturbing as in the original. There are multiple gory highlights, for example the forming of the notorious two-headed creature, that will appeal to horror freaks of ALL generations; younger ones as well as skeptical John Carpenter groupies.",The Thing
11,michaelRokeefe,The question is...what is it?,6,28 April 2012,"In this prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 thriller a team of Norwegian scientists make a sensational discovery in Anartica's frozen tundra...it appears to be an alien spacecraft. Nearby seems to be buried a traveler on that craft. Before Dr. Sander Halvorson(Ulrich Thomsen)has his crew excavate this mysterious entity; notable paleontologist Kate Lloyd(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)is flown to the research site to help possibly identify the frozen oddity. Drilling a whole in the huge ice cube to get a sample of the find helps allow the ice to melt just enough for the monster trapped inside to jump out and start killing. The ""thing"" appears to be a shape-shifter and the already scared and paranoid workers will fall short mustering enough to combat the deadly threat. What we get to see of the ""thing"" is chilling, but screen time is just not enough to really make this movie scarier than it is. Acting is nothing to rave about either. Also in the cast: Joel Edgerton, Paul Braunstein, Jan Gunner Roise and Eric Christian Olsen.",The Thing
12,hitchcockthelegend,Hvem går det?,7,10 April 2012,"The Thing is directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and adapted to screenplay by Eric Heisserer. It's based on the novel ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell and is a prequel to ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" from 1982. It stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Ulrich Thomsen, Eric Christian Olsen and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Michel Abramowicz.Antartica, 1982, and scientist Kate Lloyd is requested to investigate something strange at a Norwegian base station. By accident the Norwegians have discovered what appears to be an alien craft frozen beneath the ice. Their thoughts prove to be correct and they are rightly celebrating a magnificent discovery, particularly as there appears to also be a frozen being in the ice. But it's not long before everyone at the base begins to regret unearthing the being...No serious John Carpenter fan wanted this film, it wasn't needed or required. His 1982 film is an awesome slice of sci-fi horror, a remake itself of a very good film, ""The Thing from Another World"" (Howard Hawks 1951), Carpenter flipped the scenario around from Hawks' movie to great effect. Paranoia and creeping dread blended with amazing beasties to make for what many feel is one of the ultimate sci-fi horror movies going. So why remake it then? Well, we are told by Heijningen Jr and his team that this is a prequel to Carpenter's movie, asking the big questions such as just what happened at the Norwegian base station before Kurt Russell's manly mob got there? Making this a sort of filling in the blanks session. Not a bad idea at all is that, something good to work from, even if we know from the beginning of Carpenter's movie just how many Norwegian's survived!Now the problem here is that it may be a prequel, and attention to detail in scenes linking both films together is rather ace, but it's devoid of freshness, the makers pretty much following the exact same formula of Carpenter's film. Cue a group of scientist types getting spooked by something ghastly stalking them, cue one by one them getting offed in grizzly ways by an assimilating menace and cue paranoia and suspicion. They even put in the test sequence from 82, only with a metal slant instead of blood, while the creatures are the same only bigger in body horror terms and budget. Instead of Kurt Russell's mighty machismo, we get Winstead's spunky lady (she's the one without the face fuzz here), but it's the same old same old routine, only for the ""Scott Pilgrim"" crowd. When all is said and done, this is pretty much a remake of a far far better film.Yet for all that is annoying and unadventurous about it, it's still a bunch of fun, the director is capable in having us wonder what is around the corner, utilising the cramped interiors for maximum fret. The various creatures born out of the Thing itself are monstrous, especially the two headed one which we see horrifically birthed, and even though the CGI is there, with some of it poor, much of it is blended with practical work and the human actors to stop it from being ""all"" about the effects. It's also nice to report that there is undeniably love and respect for the 82 cut. Leading cast performances are efficient, but Winstead is just too young and looks out of place, she does not, however, fail for lack of effort to make her thinly written part work. Bonus is the Norwegian actors adding some intense character dynamics to the plotting. Beltrami's score nods appreciatively to Morricone's original, and on Blu-ray Abramowicz's steely coloured photography really pings out of the screen.In an alternative universe where there is no John Carpenter film, this would be a well regarded entry into the creature feature stable. With enough shocks and squirmy screams delivered for the genre eager crowd. But unless you are someone who hasn't seen Carpenter's superior movie, then this will feel like a shallow imitation, just like, ironically enough, one of The Thing's assimilated humans. A generous 7/10 from me because I did have fun watching in the privacy of my own home with the lights off. Other Carpenter fans, though, are most likely to start rating from my 7 and work backwards I feel...",The Thing
13,Theo Robertson,Perfunctory Prequel /Remake,6,14 April 2015,"It seems somewhat strange that someone wants to do a prequel to the thing after a gap of 30 years . John Carpenter's movie absolutely bombed at the box office , though to be fair to him over the years it has gained a reputation as being an undisputed classic of its genre . Let us also not forget the movie business is never about art and always about business and profit margins which is fair enough . Even so in an era of reboots , prequels and remakes there does some to an utter lack of creativity and imagination in Hollywood As it stands this version of THE THING is an acceptable , perfunctory remake but little more than that . Certainly if you've no knowledge or great love for the 1982 version then it does its job as being a traditional horror movie where people try and hunt down a horrible slimy monster and find they might be the ones who are being hunted . Don't hate me for saying this but I don't think Carpenter's film is the masterwork it's often touted as . It does have a gloomy nihilistic mood that never lets up but the story itself is entirely threadbare and does contain numerous plot holes . So does this version and these things remain such as no one having the brains to radio up reinforcements . Indeed this seems to something of a bugbear in that the Norwegians have discovered an alien spaceship and its still living occupant and yet don't feel the need to broadcast it to the outside world . There's also a lack of internal continuity as to how it ties in the 1982 version . This is a prequel remember but the production team seem to often forget this treating the film as a straight remake then suddenly remembering at the end it's supposed to dovetail in to another movie One thing the two versions can't escape from is that in 1982 the technique of computer generated imagery ( CGI ) didn't exist where as now it's totally run of the mill . This meant that in 1982 Rob Bottin as his team working in make up , prosthetics and effects had to really earn their money and one can't help thinking that much of the aura surrounding the 1982 version is mainly down to the genuinely stomach churning metamorphic gore is simply down to the effects team doing so much with so little . Here all this is replaced by CGI . Don't get me wrong the CGI here is never bad especially compared to another film I saw recently THE MIST from 2007 but you're constantly aware everything supposedly shocking is achieved by someone using computer software . I'm guessing cinema has lost its magic these days ? To be fair this movie isn't exceptionally bad . It does feel true in spirit to a film that has the dubious tag of being a ""Classic"" but by the same yardstick there's nothing exceptionally good about it either and all the plot turns from 1982 are recreated in 2011 in a rather unimaginative way which is in keeping with modern Hollywood",The Thing

Of course, the creature can break into crawling pieces with tentacles that grab and mouths of teeth that attach. A test to determine if any of the crew is replicated involving blood is sabotaged, with only the search for fillings in teeth an option. This isn't a remake but a faithful and dedicated prequel to Carpenter's '82 film that painstakingly details what happened on the Norwegian station investigated by MacCready and company. What has often been mentioned in the '82 film is that no women were on the American Antarctic outpost, rectified here with the lead role played by actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead as paleontologist, Kate Lloyd, asked by Ulrich Thomsen's arrogant and snobbish Dr. Sander Halvorson to come to the Norwegian base to help him in the recovery of his alien find. Sander doesn't like to be countermanded by anyone, much less an American scientist too big for her britches. In actuality, Kate is reasonably cautious and concerned, rightfully so, and Sander doesn't do her nerves any favors by forwarding ahead (and the scientist he is, believes the creature is of the utmost importance, worth studying even after it nearly consumed and ""imitated"" one of the Norwegian men).Like its inspiration, this The Thing follows the basic model of scared scientists and men captured in a period of distrust, fear, and panic, with Winstead trying to keep her (and their) wits as splintered creatures scamper about, looking to consume them (if some of them haven't been consumed already). I did appreciate the effort to mimic difficultly how the Norwegian station looked in the original; this does show that those who made this prequel cared wholeheartedly about Carpenter's film. To be honest, I didn't think this was poorly made or anything, but it just wasn't that extraordinary in any way. Some good creature effects (and some poor effects) do help, and some of the CGI uglies sure are grotesque. I even thought there was some nail biting suspense. The cast do show the discord and terror, the increasing suspicion that he or she is not who they say they are, really well, which is important, but the characters aren't that incredibly developed or particularly interesting, even if their welfare still evokes concern (it is hard not to place yourself in that situation and have a little gulp in the throat). I dunno. It all just feels relatively familiar, with steps retraced and just slightly different than before. Inside the ship, I think the film loses steam; the effects inside there never quite reach the same level as the creature effects in the station. Winstead proves here (in a non-glamorous role that doesn't cater to her beauty) she's a capable actress in a part that is more character-oriented than usual for her. Joel Edgerton is an American chopper pilot whose plane takes a header thanks to an alien revelation; his role is second to Winstead, but he could be an alien himself. Eric Christian Olsen--of NCIS: Los Angeles--has a rather underwritten part as a member of Sander's team who is also Winstead's pal. There wasn't much of an outrage or outcry as I can recall when this was set to be released. A commercial flop that didn't even make back its budget, I can see why there hasn't been a major amount of resentment; it just kind of fell to the wayside and was rather forgotten. Years from now, it might play relatively well on some premium cable channel, but I can't imagine there'll be much of a fuss about its deserved of better respect.",The Thing
15,Hey_Sweden,Underwhelming.,6,1 July 2012,"This would be more notable if there were nothing to compare it to, but since that's impossible, this prequel to the popular 1982 John Carpenter monster movie does fall short in some critical areas.It tells the story of the doomed Norwegians who found the flying saucer and creature in the first place, and the catastrophic events that led right into the events of the 1982 movie. Of course, since we know how things are going to end, that removes a fair bit of the suspense, and it removes the mystery of what went down at the Norwegian base. It worked better when we had to imagine the chaos while watching the Carpenter classic.This movie plays it safe in some ways, including American characters and more than one female. (Die hard fans of ""The Thing"" '82 know there was at least one female in the Norwegian group, according to the photograph held by Blair at one point.) It's largely in the mold of the modern big budget genre movie by having things happen as fast as possible, eliminating the slowly building sense of dread established by Carpenter and company 30 years ago. It is mildly amusing to note how the filmmakers set up each and every corpse and character encountered by Carpenters' group, and it is good to note that they're big fans of ""The Thing"" '82 as so many of us are.They also come up with their own way to identify people who've been assimilated that has nothing to do with anything in the '82 movie. They do manage to create some atmosphere, filming actually not very far from where Outpost 31 was originally created, but the characters are often hard to distinguish from one another, and they don't have the memorable personalities of the 1982 characters. Marco Beltramis' score is another problem. While not exactly a bad score, it's a little too thunderous and generic and not as unforgettably subtle and creepy as what Ennio Morricone composed 30 years earlier. The acting here basically gets the job done. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is okay as a Ripley - lite kind of action heroine, and Joel Edgerton is playing a part clearly patterned after the low key bad ass that Kurt Russells' MacReady was. The plethora of digital special effects tries to be horrific, but it doesn't display the same sort of wild imagination. (Hand & forearm monsters can't quite compete with a severed head / spider thing.)In the end, this movie just doesn't have the ambiguity, or true get-under-your-skin creepiness, to set it up as something that will still be remembered and respected decades from now. It's really not a *bad* monster movie at all, per se, just a fairly routine one. Its end credits are fun, though, the way that they neatly dovetail with the beginning of ""The Thing"" '82.Six out of 10.",The Thing
16,preppy-3,Very good prequel to a sequel!,8,17 October 2011,"OK--this is not a remake of ""The Thing"". This is a prequel to the 1982 version. A team of men and two women are in a remote research facility in Antartica. They discover an alien spaceship and a frozen thing close by. They take it back to their facility. They think it's dead...but it's not. It immediately attacks the men and has the ability to duplicate anyone it kills. Soon nobody trusts anybody and there's something wandering around killing everybody off.OK--this isn't as good as the 1982 redo but it still works very well. It manages to build up the same tension and paranoia that John Carpenter did with his version. The cast consists of little known actors (I only recognized Mary Elizabeth Winstead) which helps. If it had some big name actor you would have always been aware that you were watching an actor. Also there's no unnecessary comic relief or stupid love story worked in. This is just out to scare you--and it does! The special effects are excellent and VERY gruesome--but for me it was sometimes too obviously CGI. Also there's a sequence aboard the spaceship which really wasn't needed. It looks exactly like the one in ""Alien"" and can someone explain WHY the ship has passageways that are too small for the Thing to get into? Still I did like the film and it seamlessly leads into the 1982 version. Worth watching if you have a strong stomach.",The Thing

18,zardoz-13,"Generates None of the Fear and Paranoia of Carpenter's ""Thing""",7,14 October 2011,"First-time Danish helmer Matthijs van Heijningen's remake of the legendary 1951 creature-feature ""The Thing from Another World"" qualifies as formulaic but respectable nonsense. The original ""Thing"" preserved only vestiges of author John W. Campbell's vintage 1938 short story ""Who Goes There?"" Instead, the 1951 epic forged the conventional alien-on-the-rampage plot at an isolated, snow-swept, scientific outpost in Antarctica. Not only did ""The Thing from Another World"" constitute one of Hollywood's earliest epics to depict extraterrestrials, but it also was the first that boasted a hostile alien devoid of compassion. The original ""Thing"" alien was a towering Green Giant vegetable humanoid with a blood lust who gave the scientists and their military guardians a royal headache before they managed to fry it with electricity.In 1982, ""Halloween"" director John Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster produced a sequel that picked up as survivors from the initial tragedy encountered a nearby community of scientists. The pugnacious alien invader plunged into their camp in the form of a Yukon husky, and created mayhem. Instead of contending with a humanoid creature, the guys in ""The Thing"" confronted a carnivorous, shape-shifting beast with tentacles, ravenous teeth, and a bad attitude that absorbed its victims and then impersonated them. The monster remained in one body until it fled to another. Consequently, nobody trusted anybody. Trapped in a remote outpost at the bottom of the world, the characters suffered from extreme paranoia. Principally, they suspected that one of their own had been cloned and threatened to not only kill them but also clone them. Van Heijningen and ""Final Destination 5"" scenarist Eric Heisserer have appropriated the complicated Carpenter and Lancaster approach rather than the straight-up, single alien invasion plot. Nevertheless, Heijningen and Heisserer have altered a thing or two. First, the hero of the new ""Thing"" is a woman. Second, the way that our heroes test to determine the presence of the alien differs. Mind you, the new ""Thing"" isn't as creepy as Carpenter's masterpiece with its abundant atmosphere and charismatic cast. Nevertheless, Heijningen and Heisserer deserve recognition for their fidelity to the spirit of the original and the sequel. Of course, it doesn't hurt matters that two of the producers of Carpenter's ""Thing"" also produced this remake.""The Thing"" takes place in Antarctica in winter 1982. Arrogant Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen of ""Season of the Witch"") persuades a graduate student, American paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""Black Christmas""), to join his Norwegian geological expedition. She accepts and finds herself freezing her fanny off while the guys show her their top-secret discovery. They have found a gigantic alien spacecraft which had been entombed in the ice for possibly a hundred-thousand years. Unlike the original, these scientists stumble onto the spacecraft in the ice but they do not blow it up accidentally. Like the original, they locate the mysterious body of an alien that ejected from the craft. They carve it carefully out of the inhospitable terrain and stash it in their research facility for analysis. Eventually, the ice thaws, and the monster escapes. Our heroes realize they are contending with a deadly alien and arm themselves with flame-throwers. They start to worry during an early autopsy when it becomes apparent that this creature can spit out replicas of their colleagues. Things reach a crisis point, and nobody trusts anybody until the savvy Kate figures out that the alien cannot replicate inanimate objects, such as jewelry, appliances attached to bones, and silver fillings in their teeth. Unfortunately, some of the scientists don't have silver fillings. They have porcelain fillings. Ultimately, everything boils down to a game of cat & mouse. Happily, Van Heijningen and Heisserer drum up an adequate number of scares to keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Moviegoers who don't do horror movies might find ""The Thing"" a bit more demanding, especially when a gash appears in one character's face and runs to his scrotum while his stomach sprouts elephant tusk teeth and opens with a hellish scream.Creature designer Michael Broom of ""The Mist"" and ""Predators"" has conjured up several memorable creatures. At one point, the alien absorbs two men so that it looks like a two-headed transplant on the warpath. When the monster is in its natural form, it can project a slimy-looking tentacle that perforates flesh and bone and its tip turns into a grappling hook before it retracts its victim into its voracious maw. The worst thing that you can say about the new ""Thing"" is that nobody delivers any memorable lines of dialogue and the cast doesn't look chummy enough to have been working as long as they have at the outpost. Heijningen paces the appearance of the alien for maximum impact and he ratchets up the action in the final quarter when there are fewer than three scientists. Like the Carpenter classic, the remake refrains from inserting humor to lighten the atmosphere. Ultimately, although it is a remake of the 1951 ""Thing,"" the new ""Thing"" shares more in common with the Carpenter version. Despite the sense of déjà vu that accompanies this polished production, ""The Thing"" lacks the surprises of the sequel, but it scores major points with its creature designs.",The Thing

However, I found this version quite entertaining. The plot was OK, the CGI was great - very gross and very scary - and the tension was built and maintained well.

20,Boba_Fett1138,The prequel that became a remake.,5,3 March 2012,"It's sort of weird how this movie went through several stages during production. What was originally supposed to be a prequel, turned more into a remake, of John Carpenter's 1982 movie ""The Thing"", which on its own was a remake of the 1951 movie ""The Thing from Another World"". And out of the bunch, this latest 2011 version is by far the worst one.It isn't even necessarily a bad movie because it happens to be a weak remake of a classic movie but also as a genre movie on its own, this is a real lacking one.They will still pretend and try to sell this movie to you as a prequel to the 1982 ""The Thing"" but let me tell you, if this truly was supposed to be a prequel, than why does it carry the exact same title as the 1982 classic and why does it feature some of the exact same moments in it? Really, if you're familiar already with the John Carpenter movie, than there is absolutely no reason for you to ever see this movie. It adds nothing new and chances are it will only anger you to see this movie doing lots of things wrong, which the 1982 movie did so brilliantly.Where to begin? Well, let's first start off by saying that the movie has far too little tension and excitement in it. This is all due to a rather weak buildup. Things simply happen and it thinks that it is enough to show a bunch of very random killings to turn this into a tense and spectacular movie. It simply doesn't work that way. It should had taken its time to setup its characters better first and after that it should had also taken some more time to buildup its mystery and suspense. Instead now the 'thing' is on the loose pretty early on in the movie already and also gets fully revealed way too early on.Another thing that this movie did poorly was having too much of the 'thing' in it. Thing about the 'thing' is that he can be everybody. He (or perhaps she?) is a shape-shifter and can turn into anyone that it first kills and consumes. This movie does this far too often, instead of focusing on the mystery or tension of how the 'thing' can be. it becomes a sort of a gimmick for the movie instead. It besides shows the 'thing' too often in its alien form, which also takes away so much of the mystery and threatening power of the creature.It's also true that it uses far too many, not always even so good looking, special effects. It's perhaps not fair to keep comparing this movie to the far superior 1982 one but one of the biggest strengths of the 1982 movie was the use of practical effects. Everything looked so incredibly scary and disgusting because of that, while this movie never manages to succeed at this, not even remotely. It isn't even an all that gory film, which will also probably disappoint some of the horror fans.No, it of course is not the worst genre movie I have- or you will ever see. It's just a bit too formulaic all and without any true good tension or mystery in it. It's disappointing really that this movie isn't trying anything new or creative with its concept and instead is being more of the same, when you compare it to the 1982 movie ""The Thing"".5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Thing
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,That Thing That You Don't Do Well Enough,6,14 October 2012,"Paleontologist Kate Lloyd(Winstead, who isn't defined by her gender one point in this flick's favor) is recruited last minute to Antarctica, because they wanted a proxy for the audience(someone to be introduced to the others for our benefit, so it can seem forced and won't feel different than most elements of this), and a research base there, run by Norsemen and Danes(speaking Norwegian and Danish! And they actually got people from our two countries to play several major roles), has just found what may be an extra-terrestrial in the ice. This mimics(ironically) everything it can from the '82 one, showing a genuine love(and they did painstakingly recreate the camp seen briefly in it, even if every single unnecessary explanation(to its credit, this does only do that for the setting, not the titular being) for something best left to the audiences imagination you know, a *mystery*, was going to be disappointing), and betraying a clear lack of comprehension of what made it work. Characters are barely developed at all(I can't recall any distinguishing traits, and I just watched it), and the dialog is dumb, repetitive(and sometimes they just do not shut up, leading to a bad case of forgetting the rule of ""show, don't tell"") and Hollywood-ish(big declarative statements, ""this is our only hope"" - not how people actually talk), so in spite of the acting talent, we don't care about anyone. This doesn't build atmosphere at all, opting for boo-scares instead, and changing the behavior of the monster(which is horribly overexposed, not to mention rendered in I-can't-believe-that's-not-CGI animation(oh, it's detailed it's still fake-looking, they don't use it right, you can't just throw it in our faces and hope for the best, the practical FX of Rob Bottin are far superior), and in spite of capable people in the department of this one, they fail to come up with more than one grotesque concept for nightmareish creature stuff(that isn't simply reiterating the JC version yeah), and they then continue using that one over and over) simply because that's what stupid teenagers might prefer(also explains the use of post-2000 ""gotcha!""-twists you know, where you think you've guessed what's gonna happen, then they reveal that it's something else; not compelling, just simple misdirection; it's also way too eager about using these, and spams them) – and before you say ""audiences aren't going to accept something similar to the Carpenter version today"", well, then why even make this already pointless prequel? We know exactly where it's going to end. It doesn't address the obvious issue that we, the audience, already know what these characters don't(notice how the Alien sequels all had someone who knew what was going on?), and the pace is somewhat slow, or at least starts out that way. Then it kinda starts and stops a bit, and you find yourself checking your watch, hoping for the 94 minutes sans credits to pass already. The climax is painful. This has people making bad decisions usual to the horror genre, and the attempts at paranoia are all misfires(yelling and having some people we like being accused by some we don't isn't going to work, guys). There is a lot of bloody, disturbing gore(don't get your hopes up, it's not that convincing) and some strong language in this. The DVD comes with an interesting and informational commentary(the director, producer Eric Newman), the 14 minute documentary The Thing Evolves(which I review on its separate page here on the site), 9 and a half minutes of average deleted/extended scenes, the decent 5 minute featurette Fire & Ice and trailers for Battleship, Safe House, American Pie Reunion & The Scorpion King 3: Battle For Redemption.

22,neil-476,"Not bad, not great",7,9 December 2011,"I've seen enough films over the years to know that, for every ET or Starman, there is a regiment of Aliens or Predators or Things. If you find a spaceship buried under the ice in the Antarctic - leave it there! Nothing good will come of digging it up, I promise you!Way back in 1951, John Campbell's story The Thing From Another World was made into a movie (starring, memorably, James Arness as ""a giant carrot""). This simple tale of a murderous alien running amok in the claustrophobic setting of an Antarctic research facility was remade in 1982 in colour, and with groundbreaking (and famously grotesque) physical effects, by John Carpenter. Now we have a prequel to Carpenter's take on the story, showing what happened to the Norwegian facility which was deserted at the start of Carpenter's film (the earlier film, but later in sequence of events).The problem is that there is only so much you can do with a murderous alien running amok in the claustrophobic setting of an Antarctic research facility: the only toys you have to play with are a) what order people get bumped off in, and b) how gross can you make the effects. For that reason, and because the appearance of the Thing effects derives from the designs in Carpenter's original production, this film has been labelled a remake, and I think this is inevitable. Having said that, there is some new ground covered, particularly towards the end (although, of course, it is necessary with a prequel to set up the beginning of Carpenter's movie).Mary Elizabeth Winstead is, as usual, winsome. However, this is not the Ripley role which is going to elevate her to leading lady status: she never really imposes her authority on a role which demands it.What else can I tell you? The cast of (mostly) Norwegians get duly slaughtered one by one (and sometimes two by two) but, as you never really get to know any of them, their deaths are mechanical exercises in last-one-standing rather than anything carrying an emotional significance. The effects - a mixture of mechanical and CGI are nicely done in order to build one, but not overpower, those in the Carpenter film - there are some pleasing grotesqueries on show.Overall, despite the fact that this film ties itself together at the ankles before it sets out, by virtue of what it chooses to be, it nonetheless succeeds in its modest ambitions.

23,ferguson-6,Ain't No Thang,6,16 October 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's tip our ski masks and flamethrowers to John W Campbell Jr. He wrote the 1938 novella that has inspired 3 versions of The Thing, plus the Alien series and numerous other sci-fi movies and TV episodes. This latest version is actually a pre-quel to the 1982 film John Carpenter's The Thing starring Kurt Russell. First time feature director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr does a nice job of staying true to Carpenter's version and offering a back-story, while still coming across fresh for a new generation.Going back to 1951, The Thing from Another Planet succeeded in frightening a bunch of young filmgoers and hooking them on sci-fi and terror at the theatre. In that version, James Arness (later famous as Marshal Dillon in Gunsmoke) was a hulking creature responsible for many nightmares for kids in the 50's. John Carpenter updated the look in 1982 with a version that has become classic sci-fi and horror, and now this version takes advantage of today's spectacular special effects.The special effects do dominate and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The creature and its process are on full display quite a lot, so instead of suspense, we get outright fright shown by the research team. If you aren't aware, this research station is located in Antarctica and the frozen tundra and isolation are characters unto themselves. There is very little character development in this most recent version. We do get a Ripley-esque Kate played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Death Proof cheerleader), a misguided scientist (is there another type?) played by Ulrich Thomsen, and a right guy in the wrong place nice guy played by Joel Edgerton (Animal Kingdom, Warrior). The rest of the cast are mostly Norwegian dudes who surely have had better vacations than this.The movie has a couple of very nice shots depicting the frozen terrain and a very cool overhead of the creature frozen in ice. Other than that, fans of the 1982 version will be glad to know that the flamethrowers are back, as is the dog. Just know that this one is driven by special effects, so if you are up for a creature/alien film, you'll probably be satisfied.",The Thing

The Carpenter film seems like a knock off of Alien, but this film seems like a knock off of something from the city dump. It introduces faceless individuals whose soul purpose is to get mangled by this nasty creature, which these idiots discover and decide to thaw out. Matthijs van Heijningen Jr is backed with impressive special effects that rival the 1982 film but the screenplay is a by- the-numbers lineup of actors waiting to die. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is cast because the film just needs a woman. She was terrific in Scott Pilgrim Vs the World but here she is suppose to be a tough female version of Kurt Russell and it is pure cardboard. Joel Edgerton surprisingly isn't given the opportunity to bang her. Perhaps that is a plot twist. Anyway, his helicopter goes down when the creature has imitated one of the many flat people in the film. Ulrich Thomsen is given the worst role as the idiot who hires Winstead for the job and goes on to debate her at every opportunity. The Carpenter version succeeds over this for its creative creature effects. The same can be said here. The creature attacks and imitates the cells of its victim until it duplicates.

While there were times where this one was infinitely familiar the fact that it was the only real flaw here makes this a lot of fun. The fact that the paranoia and utter cluelessness of who's-who in here is perfectly handled and makes the suspense really stand-out. The visuals here are top-notch, with the snow-bound setting, high-tech research center and shifting alien meshing well together here and creating an atmospheric location perfectly suited to house the action within. That action is indeed a lot of fun, with highlight quality scenes including the transformation of the doctor, the kitchen sequence and the transformations done during the testing and all the fire spit out. That creates a sense of fun to witness all the attacks be utilized with that tactic, and generates a sense of fun here, especially with the different designs for the tentacled beast shown.

I just saw the Hellraiser remake and hated it so I was ready to criticize The Thing.Once over I wasn't left with a bitter feeling. It worked out fine despite some things I didn't like. The acting was okay and so far they were all unknown for me except Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3). I also knew that for Matthijs Van Heijningen Jr. there must have been so many pressure because it was his first feature to direct.

The story looked the same as the 1982 version and once they dig up The Thing things go awry. And it literally went awry. The first person changing into the thing was full CGI were as in the 1982 version is was all done with the real stuff thanks to Rob Bottin. Other parts were really excellent done but at the end there was for me to much of CGI thing. It was always a face being seen ripping open to reveal some teeth. So on the part of the effects it was a bit of a let down but other parts were well done like the dissection of one half human half thing. The thing (no pun intended) that was breaking down the flick was the part with the space ship. Did they really need to visit it? It reminded me of the last Indiana Jones were there is also a spaceship breaking down the flick. We all knew from the beginning that it came from outer space. It will look stupid but once the end credits started I heard Ennio Morricone's music from the 1982 version. The end credits were suddenly interrupted and the revealing was out that it was a prequel. I enjoyed it, but won't be a big fan of it, the original is much better, but it worked out fine for a remake/prequel after all the failures of remake I have seen so far.Gore 4/5 Nudity 0/5 Story 4/5 Effects 3/5 Comedy 0/5",The Thing
30,Mr-Fusion,"It's not ""bad"", but could've been so much better.",5,23 August 2012,"Let's face it, this movie was doomed to disappoint from the very first story meeting. By its strictest definition, ""The Thing"" (2011) is a prequel that is designed (from top to bottom) to dovetail right into the storyline of the original 1982 movie. But there's enough here that's (occasionally overly) reminiscent of the original that any moviegoer would reasonably ask, ""Wait, is this really a prequel, or a thinly veiled remake?"" There's a permeating sense of the filmmakers trying to ""have their cake and eat it too"", and that's what ultimately robs this film of any lasting value, for me.The action takes place at a Norwegian research facility in the Antarctic. Led by renowned scientist, Dr. Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) the researchers have stumbled upon a frozen alien spacecraft (as well as a body), and recruit American paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to help unearth the discovery. But as the specimen melts, it starts to regain consciousness. And the group soon learns (the hard way) that the alien can imitate organic life. With an impostor in their midst, the paranoia spreads, and the group finds themselves decreasing in numbers, one by one. ""Retread"" is the accurate word to describe this film, and the formulaic story makes it feel like we're watching the events of ""The Thing"" (1982) with Norwegian characters. They discover a spacecraft, the alien can imitate the researchers, and there's even a conversation around a bonfire in which the characters decide on a blood test to prove who's real and who's a replicant. Cue the systematic thinning of the herd as the alien kills one scientist after another, and it's way too similar. One of the distinct differences between the films, is the lack of attachment to most of the characters. Aside from the type-A Kate Lloyd, I didn't really care about any of these people, which kills the choking sense of paranoia that made Carpenter's film so terrific. Lloyd was the take-charge leader, and when she finally gets a hold of the flame thrower, things finally feel like they're going to pick up.In the end, there's a saddening lack of tension and an overall generic feel that keep this movie hovering in the indifferent range. Couple that with a third act that unravels, and some low-rent CGI, and this is a real disappointment. There's creativity here, and the sense that the filmmakers are fans of the original movie, but this film just doesn't have a pulse. 5/10",The Thing
31,siderite,"If this were 1982, it would have been a good movie",7,29 December 2011,"It is a tough job to make a remake/prequel of The Thing, a film that in 1982 blew away the science fiction movie scene. I mean, even if it were bad, it had Kurt Russell in it! The 2011 version has a woman (read ""female!"" with a Ferengi accent to get what I mean). Therefore, I tried as much as I could to keep an open mind and consider all the components of the movie before rating it. That being said, the movie almost sucked.Taken aside, if it were launched in 1982, maybe it would have been something to talk about, but in 2011 just rehashing a story, with a bland mix of actors and removing almost all that was good in the original film, it failed. The effects, so much easy to do than 30 years ago, are less than in the original. Worse than that, they are mostly pointless. In order to gauge the quality of the film you must remake each special effect scene with rubber monsters like in the Ed Wood movies and see if the movie still stands. Well it does not! The 1982 Thing was not only about the effects, but the scene where they were used. The darkness, the music, the story, the acting! The acting!If you have not seen the original The Thing, you might like this as the average monster movie. Then watch the 1982 version and wonder at the sheer beauty of it. Something that I thought was a bloody miss in BOTH version was that the original short story on which the films are based was describing the alien as trying to communicate. It was killing people in order to talk. That has to have a great impact on any audience if you can accurately portray it. But they missed that.Bottom line: in 30 years they have learned nothing about movie making. If anything, they forgot what it is all about. The result is a shallow, bland photocopy of the original.",The Thing
32,sddavis63,I'm Not Sure A Prequel Was Necessary,5,3 March 2014,"Interestingly enough, I didn't realize that this was a ""prequel"" until I actually watched it. My bad! My reaction to seeing that ""The Thing"" was being released in 2011 was - ""why would they remake the story yet again, less than 30 years after they remade it the first time?"" So I actually never bothered with it until very recently. Since I thought it was a remake, why would I? I liked John Carpenter's version of the story. It was pretty decent. So I was glad this turned out to be a prequel and not a remake. And yet, when all was said and done, I was still left wondering if a prequel was really necessary.It fits in with the story. No argument there. It explains what happened at the Norwegian Antarctic base where the creature came from in the '82 Carpenter version. To be blunt, I didn't really need to know that. I didn't end the '82 movie thinking, ""Wow! I wish they had explained what happened at the Norwegian base."" But somebody thought it had to be explained. Thus, this movie. And it does that, so it accomplishes what it set out to accomplish, which is more than you can say for some movies. It just came across to me as a story that really didn't need to be told; a prequel that really didn't need to be made. And, the explanation of what happened at the Norwegian base aside, it's also repetitive - because in most respects it feels more like a remake than a prequel. I mean, really, it has nowhere to go except to the same place for the most part.Having said that, this isn't a boring movie in any way. It's quite exciting. It has a lot of action. The creature effects work pretty well. The performances are good enough. I just had the feeling all the way through that it wasn't really necessary. And that detracted from how much I could enjoy it.

33,Hellmant,A good addition to Carpenter's 'THING' that all true fans should be more than pleased with!,8,18 October 2011,"'THE THING': Four Stars (Out of Five) Prequel to the 1982 John Carpenter cult classic of the same name, which was in fact a remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic 'THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD' and all three films were inspired by the novella 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell, Jr.. This film directly precedes the 1982 film and leads right into the opening moments of it, by explaining what happened to the Norwegian/American scientist crew that found 'the thing' before Kurt Russell and the research team he accompanied discovered it. This reboot stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton (most recently of 'WARRIOR' fame). It was directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and written by Eric Heisserer and Ronald D. Moore. Of course the film is not nearly as classic as Carpenter's masterpiece but it is a pretty effective prequel that fans should be happy with.The film begins with a buried alien spaceship being discovered by Norwegian scientists passing over it in Antarctica (in the year 1982). A paleontologist named Kate Lloyd (Winstead) is asked to join scientist Dr. Sander Halversen (Ulrich Thomsen) and his assistant, Kate's friend Adam Goodman (Eric Christian Olsen), in checking out the discovery. They're flown to the site in Antarctica by helicopter pilots Braxton (Edgerton) and Jameson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Once there they find an alien life form, they believe to be dead, inside the ship. They transfer it back to their base and while celebrating later that evening the alien comes to and flees. The team of scientists begin looking for it when a couple of them are attacked by it. Kate later learns that the alien can imitate any being it comes into contact with and the crew begins turning on each other, out of paranoia, not knowing who to trust.The movie is very effectively directed and while the script isn't anything new or surprising it does a good job of setting up the first film none the less. The acting is decent enough and the tension built between characters works very well. The music sets the right mood and the visuals are more than decent. The CGI is actually very well done and the creature and gore scenes should more than satisfy horrohounds. Like all good horror/creature films the atmosphere is topnotch and the movie is very reminiscent of these types of films that were released in the 80's. Like I said it's not nearly as classic as the original but who, in their right mind, would expect it to be. I'm really happy the filmmakers decided to go with a prequel rather than a remake, this way we get a slightly new story, with new characters, done with modern effects rather than the same story just updated. It's a good addition to Carpenter's 'THING' that all true fans should be more than pleased with.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSwub5D8YiE",The Thing
34,Robert_duder,Solid but missing elements. Still kudos must be given!,7,3 February 2012,"Remakes and even sequels that come decades after the original inevitably causes groans from some people. I am not one of those people because I do love remakes and sequels. I didn't realize until very recently that The Thing was actually a prequel to the original John Carpenter Horror classic. Now The Thing (2011) makes a few very important mistakes, I think, but that being said they also did some truly impressive things when it comes to making a prequel. I have no doubt at all that the film makers of this new prequel went to absolutely brutal lengths to tie together this movie to John Carpenters original. The attention to detail was absolutely phenomenal. If you watch the special features you will hear them all explain just how they did all this. The fire axe in the door, the end scenes during the credits that literally leads directly into the original film, the characters and the condition of the Norwegian base where Kurt Russell investigates in the original...if you're a stickler for details...especially in horror movies this will just blow you away.One of the details that holds this back from being truly awesome is the cast. Or perhaps better yet its the script that gives the actors very little to work with. Mary Elizabeth Winstead heads the cast as Paleontologist Kate Lloyd. She does alright and plays the scream queen decently. The character is just sort of all around dull without a lot of stand out moments. I know Joel Edgerton is a stronger actor than what this character gave him. He is just sort in the background through the whole thing and even when his character is up front he doesn't stand out. I thought Eric Christian Olsen would have a much bigger role but his character gets no development at all and is basically reduced to being horror fodder much like everyone else. In the original film the cast was so vital to the story but in this film they are all basically secondary to the monster itself. You know none of them are going to survive for the most part so it was like they didn't work as hard to develop the characters and that's unfortunate.The first film had a level of isolation, desolation and downright eerie thrills that this prequel doesn't quite match. The setting of Antarctica should have played such a bigger factor on the story. You don't get that dark eerie foreboding like the first film had. Regardless of this the film is well worth seeing. The special effects are outstanding, the monster itself is very well done and there are some genuinely outstanding scenes in the film. Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. might be too inexperienced to handle a film of this calibre because it could have been outstanding and it is still good but it missed the mark numerous times. 7/10",The Thing
35,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Not as good as 'The Thing (1982)'; not even close.,4,21 October 2018,"Yet another film that shares the same continuity as its predecessor but also bizarrely has the same title (ala 'Halloween (2018)'), this belated prequel has a hard act to follow. 'The Thing (2011)' starts off on a pretty poor foot by having the odd mission-statement of shedding light on the events that led up to John Carpenter's suspenseful, mysterious and purposefully ambiguous classic. Most of the movie is actually fairly dull and its attempts at the unnerving, 'you don't know who's the thing' thing that the first film did so well usually fall flat, too. Yet, the main problem - or, at least, the most noticeable one - is the fact that the fantastic and, frankly, frightening practical effects from the original have been replaced with weightless, unremarkable CGI that's also fairly unconvincing. The worst thing about this is that the feature originally included a number of rather impressive on-set effects, as seen in several behind-the-scenes featurettes, but the studio apparently got nervous and had them replaced. I certainly can't merit the piece for something that's not in the final product, but it's definitely a shame. Still, the flick surrounding these dodgy visuals isn't all that great, anyway. It's certainly no match for its predecessor, that's for sure. 4/10",The Thing
36,bowmanblue,A prequel or a remake? You decide,8,23 February 2015,"Okay, it's The Thing (2012) is actually a prequel. Definitely. If you've seen the 1981 film of the same name, then this one is set directly before it and clears up a lot of the backstory. It's about the Norwegian team of scientists in Antarctica who dig up an alien spaceship and unleash a hideous shapeshifting monster upon themselves.So, it's a prequel. However - and this is a big however - if you've seen the first film, this one basically copies ever scene and just changes the setting and cast to the Norwegian arctic base (as opposed to the American on in the original). Seriously, if you watch the 1981 film then watch the 2011 version, you might as well have watched the same film twice.Is this a bad thing? Kind of. It would have been nice to see the prequel try to be a little more original. However, the film is actually quite good (even though it's basically a copy/remake). I've seen a lot of people criticise the special effects. The 1981 version had no computer-generated monsters - it was famously made with latex and rubber for the monster. Now they've beefed up the budget they can afford bigger monsters via computer trickery. Some people said they preferred the original type. I also found this change okay.Bottom line: if you haven't seen the original and you like monster-munching movies, then you should enjoy this. Although, if you have seen the original then there's little to entice you to watch it all over again, but with a different crew.But, ultimately, John Carpenter's 1981 version was a classic, so, even if you hate this new version, just be glad they didn't remake the original.

Carpenter's version was just more suspenseful and I loved how it ended with 2 people surviving not knowing if one of them was the thing or not. The ending here was not as good and the final chase with the alien where its ship was was more of a generic slasher movie chase scene.Also I didn't like how it just kept duplication itself again and again, if it could do that, why not just take over everyone before revealing itself. There was only one creature found in the ice.FINAL VERDICT: It still has the same creepy music, and it was a decent movie, just not as good as the first one.",The Thing

As it stands, this movie is all right. The Thing features the same basic storyline as The Thing along with similar scare tactics.

If you'll pardon my slanguage: this one's more of a squeakuel... The ""tooth or consequences"" idea had possibilities, but the filmmaker(s) squandered THAT one pretty quickly. The cgi monster, while it may have been more ""mobile"" than the physical fx employed by Carpenter and Company, was far less frightening. This may have something to do with the inherent unreality of cgi. Despite what they had to work with (THE THING as template), the filmmakers blew it. Again. (Note: I boasted in my review of the Carpenter film that I once predicted that ""20 years from now, it'll be hailed as a masterpiece,"" or something like that.

44,TheMovieDiorama,The Thing is inferior in every aspect compared to Carpenter's 1982 cult classic.,5,25 February 2018,"I've not seen all of Carpenter's version (at the time of this review) and I haven't considered watching the 1951 original. But, I've seen enough footage and know the basic premise of the cult classic to know that this prequel/sequel/remake is a slave to a far superior iteration. On a Norwegian Antarctic research facility, a group of colleagues comes across a giant spaceship hidden beneath the ice and an alien life form frozen solid. Humans being humans, curiosity gets the better of them as they start to analyse the alien but with disastrous and deadly consequences. So, I use the term ""slave"" because I do believe this prequel attempts to replicate various plot points and gruesome scenes that its predecessor is infamous for. Problem is, Carpenter's version is utterly innovative when it comes to the utilisation of practical effects that when this version tries to use it, it pales into insignificance. The whole film feels subpar and leaves a bitter aftertaste when the credits roll. This incarnation relies far too heavily on CGI to create the scares and to enhance ""The Thing's"" monstrous persona. Granted, the creature designs are horrifically innovative where body parts split and crawl along the floor looking to inject weird bodily fluids through your mouth (gives me the heebie jeebies) or when it ferociously lies on top of you and melts with your face...! It's entertaining to watch, but the over reliance of CGI negates any real terror. Especially when it's predecessor mastered practical effects which are far superior in terms of horror. It's hard to not compare. Mary Elizabeth Winstead holds her own with Joel Edgerton who carry the film well, the Norwegian supporting cast were just expendable and had no personality. The third act I really did not like. The whole spaceship situation was just time wasted which could've been spent on something more effective.

So watching it as an unbiased stand alone piece, I'd have to say that the acting, and the quality of production wasn't as exciting as the 1982 Thing. Acting is too subdued, and progression of the story felt stale. Since we already know the story, the producers had to do lot more than making another good SF movie. In this regards, they've fell short.But I'd have to say that the idea was very good to attach a prequel to a now 30 year old movie. I saw a version that the two movies were already spliced together into a single 190 minutes movie, and it was a great viewing experience.The prequel part is more like the original 1951 in its story content.

51,dfranzen70,It's a prequel! A prequel of good repute!,7,22 September 2012,"This prequel - yes, you read that right - to John Carpenter's 1982 eponymous film is successful both as that movie's ancestor and as a horror film in its own right. There won't be a lot for fans of the original to complain about, as this one neatly segues into the opening scene of the the '82 movie, and newcomers to the plot will be startled, jarred, and invigorated by the amount of visceral violence and pandemonium and paranoia. Let me set the stage. A remote outpost in Antarctica in 1982. A paleontologist named Kate Lloyd is recruited by a Dr. Sandor Halvorson to join his group at the outpost, where they've made a remarkable discovery, an alien spacecraft buried in the ice that's apparently been there for 100,000 years or so, give or take a millenia. Shortly after Kate and other visitors arrive at the Norwegian base, the long-frozen body of one of the ship's occupants is found. Note that I said a body was found, not a corpse. But I digress. Soon the scientists and engineers are being picked off one by one in gruesome, bloody, horrific ways. I liked it.One thing I really liked about this movie was that it presented itself as not only a standalone story but also as a backstory to the '82 cult classic. Questions from the earlier film are answered here, as the end of this one moves right into the beginning of the other one. It reminded me a bit of the relation between Alien and Prometheus, although the latter has been disavowed as an actual prequel. Still, a movie that helps explain later events while still providing a lot of terror and exhilarating action on its own is a movie worth watching.To be sure, there are some downsides. A lot of the fight scenes - alien versus man, man versus man - take place in very poorly lit places, making it tough to follow some of the action. Who's winning? Who's arm is that? Did someone already get assimilated? Another problem might be the totality of characters - there are ten on the base when the visitors arrive, and that's a lot of people to track. When one is killed/assimilated, you might have difficulty remembering who that person was and whether you should really care that they're not around anymore. Plus, most of them are Norwegian, although luckily all but one speak English, and there are some other nationalities as well - but not enough for you to think, oh, that's the French guy, or oh, that's the Japanese lady. So some of these deaths sort of blend together.Movies like this - Alien, and The Thing (1982) and many others - work off the trope of there being a group of people, isolated from Outside Help, who die one by one. Luckily, writer Eric Heisserer adroitly keeps us guessing as to who is alien and who is not. It'll take more than a blood test to figure out who's a good guy.Kate is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom I know best from her role as Ramona Flowers in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. She was quirky and likable there. Here, she's serious and likable. Sure, there's a point where she makes a discovery and No One Believes Her (duh), but that's hardly Winstead's fault. I think writer Heisserer concentrated less on character development and interaction than on moving the plot along with alien attacks. Which is fine by me.Personally, my bottom line is just this. The 2012 The Thing is close to as good as the original, with an amped-up budget and gorgeous cinematography (for the scenes that aren't in utter darkness, that is). It's an entertaining, tenacious film.",The Thing
52,PWNYCNY,"This movie is the best of the three ""Thing"" movies",9,27 October 2011,"This is the third iteration of this movie and of the three, this movie is the best. First, the story is easy to follow; second, the acting is excellent; and third, it's not a special effects extravaganza. That is, the movie has a plot and tells a story. The movie's theme is: don't tamper with something until you know what you're tampering with. The movie shows what happens when unrestrained curiosity gets the best of science. By not knowing what they were dealing with, the entire planet put at risk. It is obvious that the thing is just that, a thing. The audience does not know what it is, but quickly learns that it wants to survive, and in doing do, kills its host. Unlike the previous editions of this movie, which rely heavily on sensationalist scenes, this movie focuses more on the underlying plot: what do you with a new and controversial discovery? It's an ethical question. Do you hide it or share it? If you opt for the former, then what and will you lose trust? If you opt for the latter, with whom and will you lose control of your discovery? There was a similar dilemma in 2001 - A Space Odyssey regarding the discovery of the obelisk.",The Thing
53,dee.reid,"In this ""Thing,"" there is no warm place to hide...",6,15 October 2011,"...And it is pretty cold in here. Let me just get this out of the way: John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982), an ultra-gory/ultra-scary remake of the 1951 film ""The Thing from Another World"" (which was based on the 1938 John W. Campbell, Jr. novella ""Who Goes There?""), is arguably one of my scariest movies and my personal favorite John Carpenter movie, with ""Halloween"" (1978) a close second.The 2011 ""The Thing"" is not a remake as I was originally led to believe upon hearing the news that a new movie based on Campbell's original story was in the works. Instead, ""The Thing"" is actually a prequel to Carpenter's slimy 1982 horror flick, that conveniently fills in the missing details and back-story lacking in the former. This is good and bad. The bad is that the air of mystery and paranoia from Carpenter's remake has just been lifted. That's one element that does ""The Thing"" in as a horror prequel.Secondly the good is, we get to see how the angry, desperate Norwegians from Carpenter's remake first encountered the slimy shape-changing alien, The Thing, and how it slowly but surely decimated their numbers as it killed them in some pretty horrific fashions, or how it became one of them. But it wasn't just Norwegians, see, at that first camp. There were also a few Americans amongst their ranks, led by Dr. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), on loan from Columbia University as she helps Dr. Sander (Ulrich Thomsen) investigate the discovery of an alien spacecraft buried beneath an Antarctic glacier and its frozen pilot.Of course, the curious scientists have no idea of the terror that they're in for, and they unwisely go about probing The Thing, causing it to wake up, and terrorize the camp. It doesn't take long for Kate to realize that someone at the camp is not what he or she (yes there is another woman, whereas Carpenter's remake was all-testosterone) appears to be on the outside, because this particular alien, The Thing, has the ability to assume the physical appearance of whatever life-form it consumes.""The Thing"" is fairly suspenseful in a few bits, I will give it some credit in that area. Director Matthijs van Heijningen, Jr. is good at keeping us guessing who's human, and who's really The Thing in disguise in a coat of perfectly imitated human flesh. None of the characters are really all that developed; surprisingly, it's the film's non-English-speaking Norwegian supporting players who get most of the credit here, in particular the bad-a** character Lars (Jørgen Langhelle), a burly muscle-man who while he doesn't speak a lick of English at all in the film, once he discovers what's really going on he won't hesitate about pulling the first trigger. And I'll also give some fair credit to Mary Elizabeth Winstead for wasting a few creepy-crawly Things here and there, but she's no Kurt Russell.What ultimately does this movie in for me are its CGI transformation sequences. Special effects wizard Rob Bottin's practical prosthetic effects and puppetry work on Carpenter's 1982 film is unmatched in the horror genre, 29 years after the fact. To this day, there are sequences in the 1982 ""The Thing"" that still manage to horrify me every time I see them, because I have no idea what was going through Bottin's head when he designed those effects. The CGI here just kills this movie's ability to be truly frightening (and disgusting) and make it seem like every other generic Hollywood horror flick out there.This ""Thing"" is definitely not ""the ultimately in alien terror"" (like John Carpenter's classic 1982 remake), but it is a fair prequel that manages to be mildly interesting but the rough CGI effects and a few cheap scares kill what could have been an otherwise excellent horror film in the 21st-century reality of MTV-style chop-'em-up.6/10",The Thing

I was not sure how this movie would turn out, there seem to be some mixed reviews about, some good feedback but mostly negative reviews.So I had to check this movie my self, I know a lot people are comparing this to 1982 Version, which is understandable, it shouldn't really be compared with that version as it was in 80's, a lot change since then, so as movie industry as change since the 80's.I judge this movie on its own, I did not compare it with the 1982 version, I Knew the effect will NEVER Been the same, as the effect in that movie are one in a blue moon. This movie introductions character and little character development, this movie as gorgeous Mary Elizabeth Winstead (I can help the fact that In love with her since i saw Her in Final Destination 3, I think was great in this movie as was rest of the cast.I really enjoyed watching this movie , I found it really good , the movie did really take long to start off, there were right might of jump scenes in this movie in the movie and that did try to add a bit of dark humor into the mix , which really well.The first Death was really questionable, the effect was little odd at first as the movie went on and I did enjoy the other really good effects, Which I was not expecting at all. The effect are no were near as good as 1982 to version, there were no were near the worst effect I have seen in other movies1 (Yeah, I know broke own rule here!)I really had fun watching this movie, PS(I did see The Devil inside day before this movie, which is really bad movie) 7 out of 10",The Thing

So once every 30 years, we are going to get subjected to a remake of this movie? Something to look forward to on my 80th birthday, I guess.Essentially, this is the 1982 movie with Norwegians and a cute chick. No one can really trust anyone else because anyone can be the alien. I think it's technically better, but really not necessary.

This is actually a solidly made story of humanity facing the unearthly. As many people have also observed, more of an action movie than the horror of the first movie and for several good reasons. Even if the material premise is the same, we got a new movie with new feeling characters and a different tone.The CGI effects of course aren't quite as convincing but what they lack in realism they gain in imagination, with all the grotesquery and body horror horror you didn't dare hope for with a couple of cool new ideas I won't spoil.The human conflict is also there with the same paranoia and in fighting which thankfully doesn't over stay its welcome.In short, with big shoes to fill we got perfectly agreeable tribute to a classic that will give the die-hards plenty to discuss in a mostly positive way.",The Thing
57,XweAponX,Who Goes There?,10,2 January 2012,"This EXCELLENT 2011 ""Prequel"" to John Carpenter's 1982 ""The Thing"" is the epitome of all the movies made from John W Campbell's (as Don A Stuart) short story ""Who Goes There"" published in Astounding Stories circa 1938.This tale is told from the POV of the Norwegian Camp which is not far from the American base camp we meet in the 1982 version. In this version, it follows the story in that the Norwegians find the alien spaceship buried in a glacier, and one lone ""Survivor"" close by the wreck buried in the ice. Against advice from one American Paleontologist, they dig the thing out from the ice and move it to the Camp. Against further advice, the head Norwegian scientist wants to drill a hole and retrieve a tissue sample. Let's examine this from a Horror standpoint:1) Spaceship is found, lone survivor was found frozen within 100 feet of wreck: Specimen looks nasty: RED FLAG 1 - These Idio-Dolts did what? Do they contact their countries of Origin? Nope! Do they assemble a big team of leading world scientists? NOPE, although they DID choose one smart Woman Paleontologist. Most important: Did they bring WEAPONS of any sort? Uh-Uh!2) Without any proper equipment for containment, Norwegian Boss Scientist insists on drilling HOLE into Frozen Alien Corpse: RED FLAG 23) After drilling HOLE into this frozen alien thing, what do they do? DO they set a guard over it? Do they re-seal the Hole in the Ice? NOPE! They have a PARTY and get drunk- RED FLAG 3!And so what happens after this, these maroons kind of deserved, turns out this THING ain't dead, and it has a nasty NATURE.IN THIS FILM - The Malevolence of this being is made Clear, although they did a good job of showing what it could actually DO in the Carpenter version, THIS film shows the being's Pure Malevolence. This thing can absorb someone just by that person touching it's BLOOD. It does not need to eat you, it can just melt right into you.The thing that is frightening, is that, when a person gets absorbed, do they really KNOW they have been taken over? It is shown in this film, THIS THING IS INTELLIGENT. It can plan out courses of Action. So, that when a small thing was found out about the creature, that could be used to identify it, it does NOT make that same mistake again.The short story shows more about the nature of this beast, that it can appropriate Memories from it's victims - So, you never know it has taken over someone until their head split in two or they grow more arms and a huge MOUTH is gaping at you.In that respect, the Heroine of the film played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is very lucky the first time she encounters a person who has been taken over... But after that, she has to develop a more aggressive tendencies. These films bring into mind, Odo from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, although he was not as skilled at shape-shifting the Human form as this creature is, it was known that he would eventually be able to perfectly imitate someone as the other ""Founders"" were able to do. So in a way, this ship can be seen as the first encounter of Humans with The Dominion. But the story told in DS9 was weak, if the Founders had been anything LIKE ""The THING"" they would have assimilated Earth MUCH faster than The Borg could ever do it.What these THING films and story do, is it brings out the native Paranoia of the Human Species. It's hard enough to try to live in this day and age, but when there is a real possibility that your closest friends, family members, and loved ones have been absorbed into a Shape Shifting Alien, then all Peace Love and Understanding WILL go straight out the door, and if there is no door there, don't worry, cos the Shapeshifter can and will create Protruding tentacles that can create a hole, either in you, or the wall!This film SEAMLESSLY blends into the very first scenes of the 1982 Carpenter version, plus it pays attention to little details from that film and tries to recreate them here.This film gets into the Nature of the creature a but more, but sadly, both previous THING films and this one as well, never gets into where these things came from, what kind of planets they like, etc. The 1992 film has Wilfred Brimley, as the THING, making a Space Ship of some sort, but nothing is said about it, cos Macready blows it up.From the last sentence of the 1938 story:""No, by the grace of God, who evidently does hear very well, even down here, and the margin of half an hour, we keep our world, and the planets of the system too. Anti-gravity, you know, and atomic power. Because They came from another sun, a star beyond the stars. They came from a world with a bluer sun.""",The Thing
58,Foreverisacastironmess123,"A poor imitation to be sure, but good enough as a prequel. Just think of it as The Thing junior!",7,22 February 2012,"As I first popped this into the player, I uttered a little prayer... ""PLEASE, don't be s**t!"" I wasn't hugely disappointed, but I can't say I wasn't. It was a good movie, I thought it was respectful to Carpenter's classic. It didn't have that modern in your face feeling that a lot of remakes often do. I did buy the 1982 setting. I thought that was a pretty impressive accomplishment. Was it perfect? No, it dragged on awfully, and the tone was mostly pretty dull. I was more interested in the next monster attack, rather than any human plights. It wasn't easy to get into, which is annoying, as this is The Thing we are talking about here. It also wasn't particularly satisfying by the end. I know that my main problem was the same as most, it was just too similar plot-wise, and the way the events played out, to the original. It was too much of a distraction, and absolutely impossible to ignore if you love the first one. There wasn't enough new material. Had there been, I may have enjoyed myself more. I really don't see how, given the plot trappings, how it could have been vastly different. It's very true that it doesn't compare to the original, but I don't think it tries to. Whatever it was or wasn't, the movie was nothing like the horrors of other recent remakes of horror classics. As a prequel, it does go well with the first movie, it kind of fleshes the story out a bit, and it sure makes you appreciate it a whole lot more. Like the Thing itself, it's a lesser extension of a greater mass. It's not a bad movie by itself. I bet if the 1982 version had never existed, there would be 10 out of 10's all around. As it stands, I consider 7 out of 10 to actually be generous.:::2::: Something I found quite annoying was how most of the cast seemed faceless and boring. With however, the exceptions of Winstead, Joel Edgerton as the ""nice"" and handsomest Norwegian, Eric Olsen because of his pretty face, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje(phew!) because he's awesome, (okay, yeah, and indeed black!)and the jerk boss Norwegian who probably helped doom them all with his stupidity. That was about it for me. Not too many strong characters that you actually cared about, which was definitely one of the original's greatest strengths. It was a tad confusing as to who had died and who was talking most of the time... :::3::: I thought Mary Winstead's character had the most presence, and to me was the strongest character in the movie. And it wasn't just because she was a woman in a (mainly) all male cast. I thought she had a very calm, level-headed, quietly strong quality to her. I was a bit sad when Kate chooses to freeze to death at the end. But, she did disable the ship, her sacrifice was not in vain. I would have very much liked to have seen a lot more of that ship. Fans pondered for almost 30 years and all there was were a couple of smoking corridors and some weird pixel engine thingy. Hate that. I thought her performance alone was one of the few things that make the movie worth watching, and compensates a lot for the distinctly bland feel of the whole thing. Also, I never thought for one second that she looked like some ""badass babe"" chasing monsters around. Not this girl. :::4::: I thought they got the monsters right. The terror and the havoc that they bring, the raw visceralness of their presence. Sure they were cgi, but it was convincing cgi. I actually thought most of them were kinda boring. Too humanoid, too small. I thought what they did come up with was adequate, and in one instance amazing, but they had years to come up with some truly mind blowing ideas, which I think they mostly really didn't. Sometimes the effects were contradicting. For instance, I hate how bad the cgi looks on the helicopter guy as his face cracks open, but I loved how the ensuing tidal wave of tendril spaghetti looked a second later. That stuff was just like the gore that erupts from the chest of Norris in the original. The moment when the monster straddles a wounded Eric Olsen is so nasty on several levels. The effect looks amazing as it cuddles with him and melds with his face. To me it's that nightmarish body horror element, that invasion, violation, and corruption of the self, that is truly frightening about the Thing, rather than that oh so precious atmosphere of paranoia, or even the monsters themselves. Ha, the one at the end looked like some kind of giant walking vagina! They also should have used that horrible scream. There was however, one monster that I loved. I speak of course of the double-header. That was awesome. It was the freakiest and scariest organism by far. It is such a striking image in the first movie. I certainly thought they did that justice. The monsters here looked technically better than the originals, but they had none(except one) of the magic of those creations. If nothing else, it was great to see the most horrifying and terrifying alien lifeform ever in action once again. I really hope this isn't the last we ever see of it. :::5::: The way the film ends, where the other begins, really sold me on how much I liked it, which turned out to be merely just enough. As remakes (remake, prequel, in this instance what is the bloody difference?) go, this one could have been a lot worse, but it really is nothing more than an enjoyable imitation. Oh well... Nice warm up to the first one, I say.",The Thing
59,barnabyrudge,"Direct prequel to the 1982 The Thing - emphasises special effects slightly more than paranoia and suspense, which rather lets it down.",5,8 November 2011,"Fans of John Carpenter's 1982 version of The Thing will no doubt remember the opening scene in which a pair of Norweigans pursue a seemingly innocent dog into an American Antarctic base and start shooting the place up. After killing the Norweigans, the bewildered Americans fly over to their base to find out what made them act so crazily and irrationally. Here they discover burnt shacks, cremated remains, mutilated corpses and even the charred body of a two-headed human. If you've ever wondered what happened at the Norwegian camp, this 2011 reboot offers your chance. Matthijs Van Heijningen Jr, in his feature film debut, takes us right back to the beginning to look at this story from the Norwegian point of view. So, although the film is in essence a remake, it gains a little extra mileage by presenting itself instead as a prequel.Young American palaeontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is approached by Norwegian scientist Professor Sander Halvorosn (Ulrich Thomsen), who asks her to accompany him to Antarctica where an exciting top secret discovery has been made. Upon arriving, Kate discovers that a team of Norwegian researchers have uncovered a crashed spaceship, encased in the ice for at least 100,000 years. More amazing still, they have discovered the frozen body of an alien nearby. After taking the alien back to the camp for further tests, it isn't long before the thawed-out creature awakens from its long slumber and starts wreaking havoc on the scientific party. Not just any old human-guzzling monster from outer space, this alien can invade the body of all living creatures and imitate their cells exactly, presenting itself as a perfect copy which no-one can tell from the real thing. One by one the scientists are infected by the creature, causing paranoid tension to run high as those still human try to work out who among them isn't quite what they seem The original story, Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, first appeared in a magazine in 1938. It has undergone two previous big screen treatments, firstly in 1951 as the classic The Thing From Another World and secondly as Carpenter's 1982 shocker. The very first version had budgetary and technological restrictions, so rather than relying on a welter of gory special effects it had to deliver its shocks more subtly, generating paranoid suspicion and gnawing tension. Although the '82 remake had its share of gory moments, it too maintained the paranoid atmosphere up to and beyond the climax. Here, Heijningen is in too much of a hurry to show off the spectacular special effects at his disposal. He dismisses the paranoid elements early on to deliver a series of chest-burstings, neck-stretchings, head-splittings and other such debatable delights. The CGI on show is undeniably well done, but I can't help thinking an opportunity here has been missed for a return to more traditional-style horror, the kind that worms its way into your mind and under your skin. Overall, The Thing (2011) is a perfectly watchable and competent film, but it's also just a packaged Hollywood thrill-ride when in all honesty it could have been so much more.",The Thing

Even viewed completely on its own away from the other films universe it's a fantastic Horror Thriller anyway!!!!
I love it's dark look that's very 80's so keeps it's time frame as it's set in 1982, it's got a real creepy atmosphere & a good music score.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic as our beautiful lead hero Kate, she gives the best performance in the movie & can even rival Kurt Russell's MCready for smarts bravery & just plain bada##, also Joel Edgerton is very good here too as American pilot Sam Carter, everything is just worked out so well it all fits perfectly into place leading up to the events in the first film, both are set in the winter of 1982 in Antarctica & both at research sites, i loved the creepy music & the dark cinematography & the excellent production design, the creature looked amazing but of course there's the use of c.g.i but still with lots of practical fx too.
I really enjoyed this Winter set Horror Thriller just as much as i have watching the original first Classic film & that's how good it is & how well it was crafted.
A great lead in Mary Elizabeth Winstead & an intense & very atmospheric mood make this ""Thing"" a GREAT film & very worthy prequel to an all time classic, i will say it that this is just as much exciting fun as the original & in it's own right it's an excellent well made gruesome Horror.",The Thing

I love the suspense, th atmosphere, I love the monster forms and tranformations. I love how blood test is now teeth test (same stuff basicly, but new way to do it).Sadly there are a few setbacks.
The things that really suck and disssappoint me:
1. They used practical effects that looked so awesome, but the studios decided it ""didn't look good enough"" so they replaced it with CGI... What a shame.
2. Another thing which bothers me is the ending, it has some unanswered questions. It kind of ruins continuity.
3. And lastly why did they cut the suicide scene, it explained the found body in the original... What a shame...Still, even with 3 huge flaws, this is a great new adition to the franchise.

62,3xHCCH,Mediocre Snowbound Alien Monster Movie,3,8 November 2011,"I had no idea that this was supposed to have been a prequel to a more famous 80s movie of the same title. That film was directed by John Carpenter and starred Kurt Russell. I have NOT seen that film, so I had no idea what this film would be about, except that it is probably a monster movie given the title and the poster.The story revolves around a group of scientists studying an alien preserved in a block of ice somewhere in the Antarctic. We soon would discover that this alien had the ability to copy human cells and turn into human clones, and kill. The first half of the film was very interesting in that once these scientists found out what the alien could do, they started to become paranoid about each other, giving the film a very tense and claustrophobic feel. Later on though, it becomes a typical monster movie where the members of the team are killed one by one until only one person remains at the end.I felt this one was a so-so thriller. The CGI monsters were so obvious and grotesque in a very fake plastic way. The premise of the alien ability to transform into humans though was very good, but being a prequel, it is not original then. As this 2011 film is meant to be a homage as well as a prequel, I guess the next step for me is get a copy of that 1982 classic film and see how this one ties into that one.

However, I have a nephew who was keen on trying this out and so I did not resist, and we rented it. All in all, I would agree with most comments I've heard from horror movie fans... It wasn't bad, I'd call it ""pretty good""... but it was virtually a remake of Carpenter's movie and therefore rather unnecessary. The story depicts an earlier group stumbling upon the Thing in the arctic and manages to hit all the beats from the '82 film. I appreciated that it maintained the same basic tone of seriousness as the other movie, and it was nice the way it even had some attributes to the 1951 version (while not going overboard on that).I didn't like that there was so much English spoken, when the other movie made it a clear plot point that the first team were Norwegians who kept all their notes in Norwegian and thus nobody could decipher them. I realize that this was done to make it more palatable for audiences to follow, but I just did not accept this crew's being rather fluent in English and figured if this was the case there would be no need for them to have kept notes in Norwegian. I suppose it's a quibble that could be overlooked, but I would have preferred the whole movie subtitled.While I liked that they maintained the general tone of the '82 film, they relied too heavily on using ideas and dialogue that almost seemed shot-for-shot straight out of the other movie. (An example that comes to mind is the autopsy sequence). The heroine says something like ""we're gonna find out who's who"" (just like Kurt Russell did)... and at the end there are two survivors hanging out and one of them asks ""so what do we do now?"" (sound familiar?). I nearly had a fit when they came up with the familiar idea to draw everyone's blood (!!!), but at least they changed it to examining everyone's teeth.Don't know what else to say. I thought the CGI was obvious and took me out of things at times, and I prefer the practical effects from 1982. I thought the lead girl was cute. Oh, and I enjoyed the end credits and how they dovetailed it leading into the Carpenter movie. This ultimately was an unnecessary prequel... but not a bad horror movie on its own, and something to watch once. But calling it THE THING again was just a mess... even when my nephew and I discussed the film afterwards it was comical to hear us trying to distinguish what we meant (""which one, this one, or the other one?""...

Great pains were obviously taken in a case where ""everyone dies"" to make sure none of the Scandinavians were blond women, which would have upset the female audiences and the Nazis.We know how it will end, and the fate of the last person isn't told, but doesn't look too promising.

The alien's cells not only devour the human cells but mimic them. That is to say that aliens take on human shape. And the bizarre behavior of some of the folks makes Kate wonder.

66,ptb-8,Teeth From Outer Space.,2,17 July 2014,"This pointless remake is so terrible and laughable as to be annoying. Silly big Jabberwocky gnashers and spaghetti veins and cardboard sets and yelling about in the dark. Honestly, why remake so badly. The ending is outrageous, silly cutting into the credits with leftover scenes if maybe a sequel. Well NO thanks. I really enjoyed the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell and it all should have been left at that. This new remake is an insult. I suppose Joel Edgerton accepted a role here and collected a few hundred $$$ dollars which should have been given to charity. The music sounded like Television sci-fi.. as if lifted or borrowed from LOST IN SPACE 1965. How did these messy silly aliens build this craft, why, where did it come from... what a waste. Cockroaches can't fly a spacecraft, even if they have three heads dangling from their groin. Silly. Awful.",The Thing
67,aidanratesmovies,"Quite Good, despite what some say",9,3 October 2020,"A very new outlook on a classic story, this prequel disguised as a remake, may not be for every fan or not of the original film- but in my opinion, The Thing (2011) is quite a remarkable piece of work that truly harnesses all the talent involved. I would say the biggest problem I have with this film in general, is the look of 'The Thing' itself. Instead of using practical effects like Carpenters original, the film decides to use CGI, which I mean, if you do it right, why not? But sadly, not only does the CGI for 'The Thing' feel terribly out of place at times, but it also just doesn't look very good, as if the company that made those special effects resigned in 2004 or something. If you can get past this flaw, and the small pacing issue, The Thing (2011) can be rather enjoyable. It is incredibly interesting from time to time, diving deeper into the tale we all know so well. Its performances are quite good, with Joel Edgerton and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as always leading the pack with their top notch acting skills. Winstead is obviously the true standout with her performance. Her character can at first feel simply like a Ripley-like copycat (kinda ironic if you think about it), but soon enough, Winstead is able to make the character her own, and is truly the driving force between the actors in this film. The production design and cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, some of the best I have seen in some time, as well as the atmosphere and tone captured throughout- truly embracing the feeling of dread from start to finish. In the end, The Thing (2011) is not perfect as the original, but it shines on its own no doubt, even despite its technical flaws. It has a grand performance from Winstead, a truly thrilling atmosphere, and some cool visuals- if that's not enough for some, i'm not sure what else is.
My Rating: 9/10",The Thing
68,questl-18592,The Other Thing,4,2 November 2020,"Ugh. Mary Elizabeth why do you do this to me? She's such an incredible actress but this is such garbage. This falls into a couple of big, devastating traps that utterly ruined it for me. Again, I think she is actually pretty good here, but everything around her is just disappointing.Possibly the most upsetting thing about this movie is what it does to The Thing legacy. The '82 film looked incredible and captured this intense sensation of isolation, paranoia, anxiety and fear while also really showcasing some amazing practical effects. It really leaves me wondering how a movie that came out almost 30 years later can look like such garbage in comparison. Seriously, this looks awful which is a wretched place to be when following up on a movie renowned for it's practical effects. Also, remake-itis is real people! This in particular suffers from a need to try and expound on and over explain things. One of the great things about the original was the way it left things unanswered and that mystery was freaky. I don't want or need to see or know more.There are a couple of effective moments in here but so much of it is washed away by the bad. In the end though, it's impossible to ever recommend this when the original is so much better in every conceivable way. There's really just no reason to ever watch this. It brings absolutely nothing new or in the way of improvement to the original. Let's just pretend this doesn't exist, kthxbai!",The Thing
69,I_Ailurophile,"Not altogether bad, but a poor imitation",6,21 October 2021,"Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. Had tremendous obstacles to surmount. John Carpenter's 1982 film 'The thing' is one of the very best horror films ever made, and my personal favorite. Perfect in all ways - its practical effects, its atmosphere of desperate paranoia and dread, its music, and more - Carpenter's film is all but unrivaled in the genre. To revisit the concept with a sequel, prequel, remake, or any other variation of follow-up inherently demands utmost scrutiny.I was encouraged in reading of the production, noting the apparent loving care by all involved to build 2011's 'The thing' with utmost painstaking consideration of the details we know of the setting and story from the progenitor - what we see in the new incarnation absolutely must comport with what we saw of the Norwegian base in Carpenter's film. I'm grateful for that attentiveness, and for the seeming effort to produce this feature with as much use of practical effects, prosthetics, makeup, and set pieces as was feasible. My enthusiasm was still somewhat dampened by also reading a note that these physical creations were painted over in post-production with digital extensions or substitutions - but still, the very fact of the endeavor says much. With all this in mind, I tried to approach Heijningen's picture with as much of an open mind as I could.So how is it?Early exposition is an unfortunate contrivance, not only feeling wholly ordinary but readily reminding of other movies. I try to balance my knowledge of the lore Carpenter's story provided while acknowledging the need to create something new, but still can't help but feel put out by the unnecessary angle so quickly lent to the narrative. Thankfully, the picture moves along quickly, and once the plot meaningfully begins, an air of profound disquiet immediately settles in.I enjoy Marco Beltrami's score. He's proven his capabilities as a film composer elsewhere, and this is no exception. At some points Beltrami's themes borrow from those that Ennio Morricone provided for Carpenter's 1982 movie, but at large the music here is all its own.I love the detail put into the Norwegian base, recreating its appearance from 1982. Set design and decoration, costume design; the broad strokes in scene and narrative writing - all quite fine. Though the plot of the 2011 film very much echoes that of Carpenter's, this is permissible in that it's easy to imagine the team at the Norwegian base would have taken measures just like Outpost 31, and followed similar lines of reasoning.What is perhaps slightly less permissible, and unfortunate, is how very direct the 2011 version is. Not always, but too often, it seems like where the prequel wants to replicate its predecessor - and even in its own fresh take on the course of events - dialogue and specific story beats are so forthright as to almost rush the progression of the narrative. This then also has the effect of dampening the atmosphere of fear and mistrust that the picture otherwise works hard to build (and which was so essential to the source material), including clever implementation of a partial language barrier.And then there are the effects. I don't claim to have so discerning an eye as to be able to differentiate wholly between practical, versus practical augmented with digital, versus pure digital. But I can say with certainty that some depictions of the organism and its many incarnations look better and more believable than others. More to the point, there are some instances that are plainly, obviously, painfully artificial, and the result looks so horridly out of place that they're akin to the CGI one might see in a SyFy creature feature. It is, regrettably, a very mixed bag.That rather describes 2011's 'The thing' as a whole, to my chagrin. In terms of craft and narrative, its greatest strengths are in the small rounding details to keep faithful to the glimpses we saw in 1982; the construction of heavy atmosphere; and those original ideas here that complement or contribute to either latter point. On the other hand: I acknowledge my bias, but sadly am inclined to think that 2011's weaknesses well outnumber those things it does well, or at least outshine them. The all-too crucial effects to realize the alien are dubious, as is the bluntness in some of the writing. Where Carpenter's 'The thing' felt like a singular, unique experience, as the action kicks up 2011's 'The thing' feels too much like a very conventional, unremarkable monster movie with a few special garnishes to taste. This absolutely includes the climax, which seems to drop all pretense of being anything but a gory sci-fi horror romp. And the last scene, as credits begin to roll - the last, important connective tissue to the Thing story we all know so well - feels too much like an afterthought, not woven in organically into the remainder.With all this said, the consideration for the cast is secondary at best, and there is nothing particularly noteworthy about any of them. I'm a huge fan of Mary Elizabeth Winstead; I think she's a fantastic actress. But all the strength of personality, range, nuance, and physicality she can muster are restricted by the bombast of the film's slant, and through no fault of her own, her performance here feels like a shadow of the skills she's demonstrated elsewhere. And if this is the case with the star, then the rest of the assembled actors don't stand a chance. Besides which - save for one other woman on the base, every character is a burly, bearded or unshaven male figure, mostly indistinguishable from one to the next. Folks - diversity is as important in fiction as it is in real life.At length, I don't think 2011's 'The thing' is outright bad. There are some elements I definitely like, and I admire the good intentions of the filmmakers. Yet to be honest, in recognition of how its best qualities are negated by its worst, I just can't bring myself to regard it any more highly. As a plain old Monster Movie, this is a fair cut above many others. As a successor to 1982's 'The thing,' in any capacity, it's entirely average.Especial fans of John Carpenter should honestly just not bother, nor even fans of Winstead. If you're looking for a solid creature feature to relax with, this is one of the best you'll find. But if you're hoping for something different, meaningful, impactful, or another dose of what Carpenter gave us a few decades ago - just move on, because you will not find what you're looking for in great enough quantity to make it worth your while.",The Thing
70,ShootingShark,Enjoyable Monster Movie Prequel To Classic 1982 Horror Film,6,15 December 2011,"Kate Lloyd is an American palaeontologist summoned to Thule, a Norwegian science base in Antarctica. The Norwegians have found a craft buried in ten-thousand-year-old permafrost, and an organic specimen frozen in the ice ...This prequel to a remake (is that a cinema first ?) details the events in the Norwegian camp which provides the back-story to John Carpenter's 1982 cult classic version of The Thing, literally ending with the first shots from the thirty-year-old film. It's a good scary monster movie, as it should be, with plenty of popcorn-flying moments and a sustained level of suspense. However, as with the remake of Carpenter's earlier The Fog, it's merely good and not great - it's not as atmospheric as the earlier film and unlike both previous versions there is no enjoyable subtext beyond the paranoia already explored. The cast are an interesting international mix (American, Danish, Australian, Norwegian, Canadian and British) but don't really gel very much as an ensemble, one of the things which makes Carpenter's version so dramatic. The most original aspect of the new picture is the female lead, Kate, played with quiet aplomb by Winstead, like a Sigourney Weaver for the twenty-first century. The tension between her as female and foreigner in a base run by men adds an interesting notch, as does horror movie maestro Marco Beltrami's downbeat score. Eric Heisserer's script is fun for Carpenter fans to spot continuity - when Edgerton picks up an axe we know where it's going to wind up - but also has gaps; there should be a big scene where the crew blow up the ice around the ship with Thermit charges but there isn't. I like the fillings idea though and there are some nice bits of misdirection, like the moment on the helicopter where the guy we expect to be a Thing turns out to be sitting opposite one instead. Van Heijningen Jr's direction is capable and he mounts some good scenes, but he's a bit too scared to go for a slow build, so as is often the case with this type of genre film there's too much action and not enough character development. The ending is annoying, cutting the final action against the end credits sequence (there's an even worse example of this in the remake of Dawn Of The Dead). I don't wish to be too much of a downer on this film - it's an enjoyable horror flick with a gritty edge, a cool monster and a great setting. I think it's also a testament to the reputation of Carpenter's film - which was universally panned and bombed at the box-office on release - that this movie even exists. Check it out, but make sure you see both the 1982 version and the original 1951 Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby black-and-white movie too.",The Thing
71,valleyjohn,Entertaining but Pointless.,7,21 December 2011,"Why? Why? Why? why would you attempt to remake a classic horror film like The Thing? John Carpenter's alien/horror movie from 1982 is one of the greatest scare fests ever made and anybody who attempted to emulate it was always on a hiding to nothing.This is the story of a group of scientists who find an alien craft deep in the ice in the Antarctic and in the process of taking samples , discover an alien life form that thrives on humans in worst way imaginable. There isn't too much wrong with this version. It's not an exact copy of the original but it does play out in pretty much the same way. The special affects are good although they rely on modern CGI techniques rather than actual models , which is a shame. If you didn't see the Carpenter version i'm pretty sure you will like this film. The problem is , is that i did see the original and I'm always going to compare the two and to be honest , this is not a patch on the 1982 masterpiece. Entertaining but pointless.",The Thing
72,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Decent but needless prequel.,6,12 December 2011,"Fans were rightfully up in arms over a remake of The Thing. Luckily what we get is a rather clever prequel, that pays homage to the original, yet refuses to reference it too heavily. Jumping into classic series can always be a gamble, and a lot of the time the studio heads are too scared to sever the umbilical cord. Even Rise of the Planet of the Apes forced in lines form the original. This is a film that follows the guys at the Norwegian research lab that Kurt Russell and co. found in the original. It doesn't tread too much of the same ground, by ignoring most of the paranoia and going for a non-stop monster movie. The creature effects are fantastic, but I can never admire them for creativeness since they were formed in a computer. It's effective, but not admirable. Nothing hits like the head separation/stomach mouth etc. Winstead does a great job at being a logical and fierce protagonist. She isn't always likable, but that's what makes her so relatable. I would have gone for a higher rating if they hadn't wiped out so many characters in such a short time.",The Thing
73,Seraphion,"A decent work on the remake, but the acting is not really that convincing",6,3 January 2015,"The story stayed true to the original movie that is one of the classic pieces of modern survival horrors. Yet the whole thing turns out to be quite sour when I saw that the horrific monsters are fully replaced by computer generated imagery. It really takes the fun of the suspense and thrills away. At times we can really see that the actors are caught on screen acting expressions pretending to see something on a location, imagining where the monsters would be. This also limits how the camera can really take good angles. For this, I prefer to see the original practical effects put in place. The acting however is really not that good in overall. Mary Elisabeth Winstead went on from acting a convincing role of a scientist to being bossy all of sudden, with all the other all men cast doing everything she said. Joe Edgerton is clearly having some issues in portraying his less talkative role. His beard also makes it harder for his expressions to surface on screen.",The Thing
74,RatedVforVinny,Some nice touches and a worthy prequel.,7,30 August 2019,"Surprisingly half decent, although the C.G.I effects were no natch to the prosthetics used in the original (82). Also the inclusion of female characters just ended up unrealistic. Where this prequel succeeds though is the use of real Norwegian actors (despite protests from the film company to do so) and the story is cleverly pieced together to where john carpenter's masterpiece starts (in where those ""crazy norwegians!"" are chasing a Husky dog in a chopper). The use of original score by morricone, sort of indicates how low on creation these re-boots can be but still more hits than missis.",The Thing
75,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An adequate homage to the Carpenter Original,7,13 January 2014,"John W. Campbell Jr.'s short story ""Who Goes There?"" has been adapted to the screen several times. According to many, people consider John Carpenter's version, The Thing (1982), to be the best rendition. And of course, it's not just because it was directed by John Carpenter himself, but also because of the actors who played their roles (which many people credit the most to Kurt Russell), the practical creature effects by Stan Winston and the haunting score provided Ennio Morricone. I'm pretty sure it was obvious to the crew of this movie that making any film anywhere related to Carpenter's masterpiece would be an uphill battle. The question is, how well does this hold up - fairly decent actually.The film, although labeled with the same title as the 1982 classic, is a prequel and not a sequel. And if there's one thing that this movie does extremely well, is the continuity. Outstanding. Eric Heisserer's writing is spot on with how the events of the Norwegian camp led into the events of Carpenter's film. However, this kind of story telling may also disrupt the fans of the original because they wanted to keep the mystery of what happened at the camp a total mystery and left untouched. But there are millions of ways to explain one mystery isn't there? I think one interpretation shouldn't be bashed especially if its explanation is plausible.But that's not to say all the writing is good. The are a few key points in the writing that make it good (like the continuity) but because John Carpenter's film had already established the destruction of the Norwegian camp, leaves barely any wiggle room for a different story. That's where the writing isn't the best. It may be a prequel, but the execution is almost exactly the same. This will give fans a big head case of dejavu, and some will enjoy the nostalgia, while others won't enjoy what seems to be a re-run. But for newcomers, the plot should entertain because it entertained the viewers who first saw John Carpenter's film.The casting is done well too. To make the setting as authentic as possible the casting department reeled in a bunch Scandinavian actors. But to make sure the viewers had characters to connect with, they also cast Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Joel Edgerton and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the main leads. And as stated in the trivia, Winstead's character was written to resemble more of a shell to Ellen Ripley from the Alien (1979) franchise. Are these characters truly anything special? Unfortunately not. They don't stand out anymore than their Scandinavian co-stars. This is due to the limited execution of how the story plays out. They do act well, but mention a character's name like Kate Lloyd some decade later and it'll be guaranteed no one will remember.Finally helping make this prequel as entertaining as possible is the special effects and music. It's apparent when the CGI kicks in, but its still professional looking. The thing ""creature"" here is much more agile and destructive during the running time. What's also good is that it keeps its grotesqueness even when used with practical effects. It is just one hulking mishmash of a messy creature. Talk about a face-lift. Musically speaking, Marco Beltrami's score has well-developed horror motifs and has a main theme as well with blaring horns and extended string chords. It may annoy fans that he doesn't stick to Morricone's theme from the 1982 film, but Beltrami does give a nod to it so give him credit for that. Fans should enjoy this, it's a noble tribute.For a prequel, its continuity is excellent in explaining events along with some great special effects and a well-developed score. However, the execution too closely resembles the classic 1982 film and the characters aren't too interesting.",The Thing
76,Rob_Taylor,The some...Thing,6,28 November 2011,"I suppose I'm being unduly harsh only giving this movie a 6/10. However, it could have been a lot more if it hadn't relied so slavishly on mimicking (no pun intended) the original.I guess it was inevitable, given the original '82 Carpenter's version setting of the Antarctic, that the events at the Norwegian base would closely resemble what later transpired at the American base. But really? Could they not have put a few more variations in than they had here? Thing (2011) has almost the same basic plot development as the '82 version, even down to figuring out a way to tell friend from foe, and the overuse of flamethrowers. Why have they even got flamethrowers in the Antarctic? To melt ice off the helicopter rotor blades? So the slavish adherence to the original Carpenter version marks the movie down, in my opinion.It loses most of its marks, however, from an over-reliance on CGI. CGI is great, especially for static backdrops, spaceship and generally anything inorganic of that doesn't change shape etc. Of course, the Thing is all about changing form and shape, and that's where the CGI lets it down. It does look okay, but it does not, will not ever, look as good as a physical prop, to my mind.The original relied on fantastic animatronic and physical effects. As a result, you knew that what you saw on screen was also what the actors were seeing when they made the movie. Here, a lot (a very great lot) is CGI, and it shows.In fact, it shows too much. That's the other big drawback with CGI. It's an imagination killer. Once upon a time a director might have said ""Let's have the monster come in here and throw the actors about!"" and the effects people would have said ""It'll look crap, since we'll have to put a man in a rubber suit."" and the director would have to work with the effects guys and the rest of the production team to come up with an acceptable way to ""show"" the scene, without showing it, if you get my meaning. So we had all kinds of interesting lighting effects, suggestive imagery and a whole lot of NOT seeing the monster. Yet the scene was shot, just not as obviously and glaringly as the director might have imagined.Now, of course, CGI can show everything down to the last detail. So there is no incentive to produce a scene in an imaginative way that makes the audience's minds fill in the gaps. We get to let it all wash over us without having to try to figure out what's going on.As a result, I think we've lost something in film-making. We no longer need the images on the screen to fire our imagination, because we no longer have to think about what we are seeing. It's not just The Thing that is guilty of this. Most CGI based movies are. But here, the direct comparison of one form of film-making versus another, namely the original '82 movie and this prequel, shows clearly what we've lost.So, The Thing loses marks to originality and CGI. So what about the characters? Are they likable? Do you root for them? Or do you care less whether they live or die? Well, mostly the latter, honestly. The cast does a good job, but again, comparisons with the original are inevitable, and unfavorable. It's not their fault, just that a few ""bigger"" names might have helped a little.There are a few plot holes and continuity errors that crop up. They do a good job of tying the two stories together. But I was left thinking that adherence to what the original stated was not high on their agenda. In the original, the Norwegians blew the ship free of ice with explosives. In this one it melts its way free.Likewise, the alien itself, having crawled away from its ship, freezes for thousands of years, then somehow is able to blow itself free of the ice block it is entombed in? Also, if its ship still works, why did it leave it in the first place? The movie explains that the ship crashed and embedded itself into a glacier. So how did it manage to get out at all? The last scene adds in the helicopter that the original movie showed the Norwegians chasing the dog with. But again, they had been talking about a storm coming in, so why was anyone flying anyway? It all has the whiff of being cobbled together with the thought that the audience won't care so long as there's CGI! Well, I'm sorry, but I do care and I do have the ability to think. So the nonsense glares out at me.On the whole, though the movie could have been better, it also could have been a lot, lot worse. We should be thankful for that, I guess, and hope that any further Thing movies that come our way are written in a more sensible and clever way.Not bad, but could have been better.",The Thing
77,brando647,Just Watch the Original Again,5,13 March 2012,"John Carpenter's THE THING is a cult classic and graces the top ten lists of sci-fi favorites for many fans, and.wait.wrong page. Let's start over: Matthjis van Heijningen Jr.'s THE THING is an attempt to cash in on John Carpenter's cult classic and will probably never find itself on anyone's top ten anything list. This remakeprequel(premakquel?) has come along almost twenty years after the original was released to hopefully make a quick buck on an established favorite. The new THING isn't necessarily a bad movie, though I definitely wouldn't call it good. It's just 100% positively unnecessary. It's a shallow attempt at recreating the suspenseful paranoia vibe of the original that is devoid of any real thrills because this movie isn't about the suspense and the fear of not knowing who can or can't be trusted; this movie is about the Thing. Because we wouldn't want to stray too far from the premise of the original: this movie follows the events that occurred at the Norwegian camp preceding the Thing's arrival at Outpost 31 in Carpenter's film. The Norwegian team has discovered an ancient alien craft that has been buried in the Antarctic ice for thousands of years. A frozen extraterrestrial specimen is discovered and brought back to camp for examination and, I bet you can guess what happens from here. It awakens and escapes from the ice to terrorize the expedition crew. This creature from another world has the capability of becoming it's prey, leading the team to fear each other as they never know who is human and who is the Thing.The premise should sound familiar because it's the exact same concept of the original, except there's a new batch of victims and the Thing has been modernized with CG. Everything that made the original creature so terrifying is gone: the practical effects that bizarre sound design that made the creature so terrifying when I first saw the film have been amped into to ""extreme mode"". We're treated to constant exposure to the creature, thereby minimizing the fear factor. When we're hit in the face with a Thing reveal every five minutes, it begins to lose its luster. The Thing attacks so often, you begin to expect it. Halfway through the movie, I'd entered the mindset that every time the hero character (in this case, Mary Elizabeth Winstead) finds herself alone with a person, it's probably the Thing. Alone with the ""hero""? Probably the Thing. Trying to cast suspicion and doubt on another character? Probably the Thing. Acts like a total tool? Probably the Thing. I don't remember being able to guess the humans/creatures so easily in the original. That's what made it so tense. And the massive CG abominations aren't as frightening when they're in constant full view and running amok through the base. Any suspense and fear in this movie isn't so much a result of the paranoia between the crew; it's expected to come from the hideous beast slaughtering them, which isn't anywhere as effective.I do need to give the filmmakers credit for one thing: they were incredibly meticulous in recreating every detail of the ruined Norwegian camp. Every little detailevery corpse, every fire, every bit of horrifying evidence found of what occurred in the original movie is accounted for here. Kudos for that, but it's not enough to make a good movie. We already know from the first movie that there were no survivors in the Norwegian camp (the only two were shot/exploded in the first five minutes of Carpenter's film). So what suspense is there? It's just a matter of waiting for each person to meet their end and seeing how it happens. Again, not much for suspense. This movie really tries too hard to be Carpenter's. Aside from the fact that they use the exact same title (which annoys me more than words can describe), they borrowed the major plot point of the first film with an established ""test"" to determine who's human. OK, I get that. I imagine it had to be addressed, but why did the test in this movie have to be so stupid? The test in the first movie was creative. The test in this movie is a joke. Also, for the record, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is no Kurt Russell. There is just so much about this movie that bothers me. The problem with this movie is that the only way to follow a movie as tense and frightening as Carpenter's THING is to either a) do the exact same thing or b) focus on the creature, providing further explanation about it and therefore ruining the mystery. The 2011 THING does both, and the final product is a less than stellar cop-out. It might be a fitting watch for a lazy Sunday afternoon if you happen to catch it on cable, but you're better off going back to Carpenter's classic for another viewing.",The Thing
78,bkrauser-81-311064,It's a Horror Thing,6,24 October 2011,"The Thing is a 2011 remake/prequel to the John Carpenter 1982 ""Thing,"" itself a remake of 1951's ""The Thing From Another World"" which was inspired by the novella ""Who Goes There?"" ...Got that? And just like anything that has been remade, prequel-ed or otherwise frappéd by the studio system, this latest adaptation has been stripped of everything that made the original story so palpable.Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited by a Norwegian research team (Ulrich Thomsen, Eric Christian Olsen and Trond Espen Seim among others) who have discovered proof of extraterrestrial life in Antarctica. Once there, the team discovers an alien life-form frozen in the ice who escapes its icy tomb and wreaks havoc on their dwindling numbers by mimicking its victims.The 1951 version was an allegory of the Cold War at a time when the notion of the 'enemy within' was genuinely scary to most Americans. John Carpenter's remake while not as lofty in scope was still abundant in paranoid thrills and remains in my mind, the best example of special effects wizardry.This version is so concerned with reverse engineering the 1982 version that it forgets to be thrilling or even interesting. Small details like an axe in a wall are given more pause than some of the characters who we are supposed to be rooting for. It gets even more annoying when these homages make little sense. Why would an alien that can impersonate its victim stalk people as an ugly amalgamation of limbs? Because the original dictates.The movie also brings up logistical questions. The crux of the story seems to have taken place in three days (the sun sets and rises as if the story didn't take place in Antarctica) with the alien taking over the bodies of around five people. When? The process of mimicking seems to take a long time in both the original and this prequel so when does the creature actually infect these people? And why does the creature (who is intelligent enough to pilot an interstellar spacecraft) not simply bide its time? Why does it expose itself so often? Other questions polluting my mind include; are flamethrowers common gear in antarctic research stations? And isn't it like -40? Shouldn't people be wearing thicker jackets and perhaps a hat? The Thing closes by tying up loose ends to the same Ennio Morricone score of John Carpenter's film.

82,oneguyrambling,A decent imitation of the Carpenter classic - but an imitation nonetheless...,5,1 March 2012,"'They' say that the reason this 2011 prequel to the 1982 John Carpenter classic has no subtitle is because they couldn't think of one, so they went with the same one. To some extent that is exactly the same as the plot – they couldn't think of anything especially new so they stuck with the same oneScientist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and crew are summoned urgently to Antarctica where a huge discovery of some kind desperately needs their attention and expertise.Once the small crew arrive they liaise with the staff of the small Norwegian outpost who made the find, and after a few minutes of getting to know you time they head to the site to find a big chunk of ice with an item frozen inside. Doesn't sound that exciting right, only it is quite a big item, and it seems to have been there for over One Hundred THOUSAND years.Kate and crew hoist the huge iceblock and haul it back to the base, where they decide to thaw it out for a closer look.Thawing is bad.It seems that the filmmakers here were well aware of the esteemed status in which the original 1982 flick is held by sci-fi/horror geeks, so rather than bother with building suspense they get right to the good stuff. Once thawed this thing (I avoided the term as long as I could) doesn't take long to work out the creaks and aches of being frozen for a thousand centuries, it gets right down to making up for lost time.Where the first film took the time to identify the nature of the foe – it takes over its prey and replicates their form, leaving both host and others unaware of its presence – Kate and co are a sharper bunch it seems, not that it helps much though, because the thing isn't shy this time around, CGI-ing its way around the facility and leaving blood and body parts in its wake.So it rapidly becomes a game of keep-e-off, with the creature stubbornly hanging on to the oblivious host until forced out into another, before the now smaller group reconvenes the thing-hunt in another room to point fingers and fidget nervously until the same thing happens again.Having a creature that infests, replicates and lies in wait patiently is indeed scary, and there are sequences that prove that, but it's like the directors felt that the best part of the 80s film was the gore (it kinda was). By focusing on the gory freak out scenes there isn't much in time to build tension before the host explodes another inhabited unfortunate in a grotesque display of splayed limbs and distorted features. (Speaking on behalf of the afore-mentioned sci-fi/horror nerds; points are definitely lost by relying on CGI, part of the 'beauty' of the 1982 flick was the gross out effects.)Ordinarily I would recommend this film due to the cool visuals and the striking effects sequences, but in this case they were all directly lifted from The Thing 1982 and then buffed up with a little (OK a lot) of help from CGI. So while I might tell a newbie that The Thing 2011 is worth your coin, for my money you still can't go past the John Carpenter's version, (which was itself a remake of a 50s film).Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. While it doesn't bring much new to the table, The Thing 2011 is a decent imitation of the 80s version, but an imitation nonetheless.",The Thing
83,Pumpkin_Man,The Thing Begins!!!,7,20 October 2011,"I'm sorry to say, but I still haven't seen John Carpenter's The Thing. It's on my to-do list, and hope to watch it soon. I understand this new movie is a prequel with the same name. It was okay. I loved the creature effects and gore scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty much the only reason I wanted to see this because I enjoy her movies and she's very pretty. Some scenes dragged, and others were suspenseful. In 1982, a paleontologist named Kate Lloyd is asked by a Norwegian scientist named Sander to travel to Antarctica to uncover a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship. They find a creature frozen in the ice, and bring it back to base. It soon thaws and becomes each member of the team and tries to escape. It's up to Kate to stop...THE THING!!!",The Thing
84,TheUnknown837-1,It's probably a better movie than I am willing to give it credit for,7,15 October 2011,"Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.'s identically-titled prequel to ""The Thing"" is probably a better movie than I am willing to give it credit for; the only major error that it makes is one of aesthetics. One that serves as fuel for comparison to that marvelous 1982 film directed by horror maestro John Carpenter. And to state that Mr. Carpenter's version is superior is rhetorical; one really does not need to see either film to be sure, for there are plenty of other examples in movie history. But this new film, despite its checklist of faults and continuity mistakes, does have enough good things going for it (including some great ""Boo!"" moments) that I am willing to recommend it.Slightly.For those who have not seen the 1982 film, here was the basic groundwork. A dog comes charging into an Antarctic research campsite, being chased by a Norwegian helicopter and a trigger-happy sharpshooter. When the campsite's refugees investigated the place where the dog had come from, they found a massacre, pulped remains of some strange organism, and a partially-buried flying saucer. Back at their base, the stray dog later turned out to not be a dog at all; but a shape-shifting alien capable of mimicking its victims and from there spun a ""who's who?"" tale, with spectacularly gory and frightening bursts of action as the alien changed shape and attacked.Now we get to see everything that came before that. The unearthing of the flying saucer, the origin of those pulped remains, and how that Norwegian campsite became a massacre. Add to that an imported subplot involving a reluctant paleontologist and you've got basically the same thing as before.Every shot in this ""The Thing"" reminded me how much better John Carpenter did his,' but that goes back to my statement that maybe the movie is better than I am willing to acknowledge. After all, the 1982 film is considered by many, including myself to be one of the best horror movies of all time. So it's kind of an unfair double standard. So despite my willingness to compare the two movies, I must be honest and confess that, in a small way, this new film works in very much the same way as the original did. Because it is essentially the same sort of movie. It's a ""who's who?"" scare picture with the jumbled assortment of characters trying to decipher who is human and who is an alien in disguise, and then tearing into each other when they cannot find out. And when somebody starts spurting blood and screaming inhuman sounds as they (or it) reveals the truth, the filmmakers are just as willing to be disgusting as their predecessors. From there, the other characters go after the transmorphing thing with flame-throwers, and the cycle repeats over and over again.Capped with some genuine ""Boo!"" moments, this ""The Thing"" did sustain my interest and I can recommend it because of that. However, I do have some observations I would like to make. First of all, the necessity of this project. Was it really necessary to begin with? Did any of us really care how the Norweigans found the flying saucer under the ice? Did we really care what the alien looked like before it started morphing itself to resemble humans? Did we really care to see the cruel manners in which the Norweigans died, since we saw the same thing happen to the Americans in the original? Furthermore, it seems as if the filmmakers themselves seemed to be in agreement with me. They seemed much more interested in just cutting to the chase, pushing through the setup because they felt it was expected of them. As a result, the first third of the picture is a little slow-going and impersonally-directed. The actors in the movie are capable of better performances, so they can't really be blamed for what they give here, since they have no characters to flesh out. There are also numerous continuity issues. The chief one concerns the alien itself. I knew it could imitate other life forms and shift between them, but this one sure must have some power if it can shape itself to resemble a light brown husky and then, two shots later, have instantly changed the color of its fur to dark black.Hmmm....But this is my biggest gripe with the picture. The special effects (the stuff that produces the heart of both movies) are actually inferior to the movie that came out twenty-nine years ago. Why? Because John Carpenter's special effects were practical. They were real. They were animatronics; they were actually in front of the camera with the actors. Here, the filmmakers are obliged to do what so many others do: use computer generated imagery to the point of overkill. And, to be honest, there is not one shot in the picture where I believed the monster was there; that I could reach out and touch it, or that it could lunge at me.I was always aware that I was looking at something created by a computer. That it wasn't really there in front of the camera.So I can probably named more bad things about this prequel than I can compliment it. And I would encourage people to check out John Carpenter's film first before seeing this one. That is a horror film for even people who don't like horror films. This one is tailored more for fans of spurting blood and ""I scared you!"" moments. Nevertheless, it is thrilling in a small way and so despite the fact that it is riddled with flaws and completely unnecessary, I was not bored or too terribly disappointed with, and therefore recommend ""The Thing.""",The Thing
85,Joxerlives,Decent sequel to John Carpenter's peerless classic,7,22 October 2012,"Really this was a very commendable effort, solving the mystery of what happened at the Norwegian base whilst not actually detracting from the original film for a moment. A shame it was such a failure at the box office but calling it by the same name as its' illustrious predecessor must have been the dumbest advertising idea in history. The good? Nice to have a female hero given that the original had no female characters whatsoever. A shame we couldn't have had more than 2 girls in the film. Nice to have more explanation of the spaceship and the events which MacReady&co discover the aftermath off. Ingenious that Kate discovers not only the way to destroy The Thing but to detect it in a different manner than the first film (and off course this means that Childs is still human at the end of the original with his earring intact). Love the scene where Kate stares up at the sky and observes that having found a crashed spaceship complete with alien pilot that they will never look the same to her again. The Bad? Forgive me but it's really hard to differentiate between the various Norwegians, especially when they have beards, they should have spent more time setting up the characters. Also I think the filmmakers made the mistake of relying too much on CGI, that they could show The Thing in all its' glory means that they did and it loses the lurking menace of the first film.One point is that this film expands the theory that The Thing is not actually trying to take over the world but actually just wants to go home, it flees when first unlocked and only strikes out when cornered having already had a 'tissue sample' extracted from it using a drill. It later tries to restart its' spaceship rather than make for the Russian base, trying to escape rather than destroy humanity. For my money I agree with the filmmakers, at the end Kate follows Lars to Outpost 31 in pursuit of the dog and rescues Childs and MacReady. Good stuff!",The Thing
86,Richie-67-485852,Sci-fi fans have to see this...that is all there is to it,6,17 October 2011,"The Thing premise is a brilliant one. In 1951, it was introduced and holds well to this day. In 1982, another version was offered and I loved it. Now, the 2011 version is with us and it still intrigues. Intelligent life plus their technology visiting us by accident or on purpose remains fascinating to say the least. Where did they come from, what do they want, and why do they go about answering these questions violently and with force? Anything that traveled this far surely could parlay first and then fight if necessary or would they? Furthermore, in all three movies, not enough attention was given to the spacecraft. It can be a movie in and of itself. The fuel, power source, technology, weapons, communications, defense mechanisms all sitting there waiting to be claimed. A gift that fell out of the sky. In addition, contact with the Alien in all three doesn't go well despite all of us having the intelligence to pull it off. Instead we are introduced to superior attitude and violence which is disappointing. In the first two films, the thing makes a couple of moves that gives you the chills. When we experience the Things intelligence, it is captivating. We do not get that satisfaction in the current movie. It just demonstrates that it can hide and then kill. The movie will make back what it cost to make plus a decent return but I do not know if that will prompt another movie. After all, it is a business and businesses have to show profits. The current movie hooks up nicely to the 1982 version. It is even left open to a sequel if ever anyone wants to go there. See this movie and experience the un-predictable chills and thrills of unknown species interacting with us humans. Anything can happen and this movie give you their take on what did. Tens of thousands of Thing fans all have clever ideas and expectations, but then that would be the movie that they would make. Enjoy this one. Pretend during the whole length of the film that this really happened just the way it is presented and then go watch the 1982 version. Hours of entertainment on an exciting subject. Heck, see the 1951 version too and leave no THING un-scene...I cannot still wonder what it would be like if some gifted story teller came up with a script that really dug in deep and covered all the bases. That would be some Thing to see...",The Thing
87,hnt_dnl,This prequel is actually the better film,10,23 January 2021,"I'm in the very tiny camp of opinions that this prequel THE THING (2011) is actually better than John Carpenter's incredibly overrated 1982 film, which itself is actually a remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 classic. This 2011 film and the 1951 original have a lot in common, but especially that they both get to the point. Instead of the annoying vagueness and murky boredom of Carpenter's 1982 film, which relies heavily on effects and very little on character, the 2011 version thankfully opts to tell a refreshingly fast-paced story that gets immediately to the point. In a way, the filmmaker had to do it this way since we already know what happens. What's amazing is that even though we know how it all plays out based on the '82 movie, this 2011 prequel still manages to hold the viewer's attention from start to finish with a good script, convincing acting, effective jump scares, and solid horror.The prequel stars the eternally underrated Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who is absolutely exceptional as the main character Kate Lloyd, an American paleontologist tasked to identify a groundbreaking discovery near a Norwegian scientific outpost in Antarctica, the same outpost that was introduced in the '82 movie. Winstead hits all the right notes and is very convincing as a scientist and carries this movie brilliantly. In fact, I much prefer her to Kurt Russell from '82. Yes, blasphemy, I know, but Russell was so 1-dimensional in that movie to the point that any of the other dozen actors in the film could have played the role just as monotone. Winstead imbibes Kate with smarts, charm, confidence, toughness, fear, and bravery. Kate is an actual character. The supporting cast is very good, too. All the characters feel like real people with natural dialogue, not any of that quippy, sarcastic, ingratiating nonsense that passes for dialogue in many modern movies.As mentioned, this movie really MOVES. Starting with the Norwegians discovering the alien craft and it's occupant, then the outpost leader enlisting Kate, then the group immediately investigating the find, then all hell breaks loose. There are no wasted scenes or moments. Every scene has a purpose. The action is smoothly edited. The cast has believable chemistry. And the lead really holds it all together. Another thing that this film does well is you can believe this is taking place in 1982 even though it's filmed 30 years later. The movie believably makes you think it's the early 80s without going nuts with the overly bad wigs and outfits. The actors all have reasonable hairstyles indicative of the era and also the outpost doesn't look modern. Also, being set in a remote snow-covered outpost compels all the characters to dress in cold weather gear, which is timeless. I don't even think it's necessary to tie into the 1982 film to even enjoy this prequel on it's own. Unpopular opinion, but the 2011 Thing is a better movie than the 1982 Thing.",The Thing
88,Fernando-Rodrigues,What's the T about the thing?,7,22 February 2021,"It's well-done, but CGI is never a good option. I'm not saying the visual effects are bad, but it's not what fans of the 1982 remake wanted.",The Thing
89,MrGKB,The thing is...,6,29 June 2012,"...that this thirty-years-after-the-fact prequel to John Carpenter's now-classic masterpiece of paranoiac suspense isn't nearly as bad as it could have been, even if it falls short of the standards set by its revered predecessor. It's not great, mind you, but still one of the better examples of hopeful franchises that Hollywood can't resist trying to create; as other wags on this site have noted, the possibilities are left ripe for further exploitation.The primary flaw is, of course, a lack of genuine tension. Eric ""Final Destination 5"" Heisserer's script redeems him from that pointless retread, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" but given that the core audience for this film is fans of the Carpenter opus, his opportunities for genuine suspense or surprise were few and far between. ""The Thing"" plays out as pretty much a straightforward monster movie. Nothing wrong with that beyond rendering the film less memorable. The cast is better than many on this site opine, but suffers from a lack of charismatic leads on a par with Kurt Russell and his supports; Mary Elizabeth ""Final Destination 3"" Winstead is no stranger to genre films, but even her journeyman performance can't elevate ""The Thing"" beyond the ranks of watchable. Still, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.'s tyro feature reveals a scion's promise, there are plenty of nods to Carpenter's film, and the story dovetails nicely into it. It pretty much tanked at the box office, but I suspect home video might allow it to break even, and I wouldn't be surprised to see another franchise entry somewhere down the line. One can only hope that the effort will be worthwhile.",The Thing
90,phubbs,The Thing,6,16 November 2014,"The anticipation and final outcome of this prequel have been split right down the middle, was it a good idea in the first place?, should it have been a sequel with Russell? or perhaps completely remade, opinions differ hugely.For me this has not been as bad as I expected in all honesty, I have seen much worse in recent years with the influx of reboots and remakes and this prequel isn't all that bad.Yes the big wigs have been rather crafty, they wanted a sequel but decided not to out of fear I think, same for remake, why remake a cult? instead they turned to a prequel which basically gave them the opportunity to make another which was pretty much more of the same but with an excuse.So yes its more of the same and it all looks the same seeing as its set right before the original, OK no problem. The look is good, sets are good, costume is good, it all looks really real, cold and the cast are actually quite decent, wisely using unknowns for the majority. I also liked the kind of 'Alien' feel to the build up with Winstead clearly having a Ripley type character of sorts.Problem one of course is the effects, personally I think its a mixed bag, its all CGI of course but some of it looks pretty good whilst other bits look poor. I think the effects department (including Woodruff Jr.) did a good job in trying to create the creature around what was hinted at in brief moments of the original whilst also trying to keep it in tone with the creature we have seen already and at the same time making it different. I think the 'Juliette-thing' looked really good simply as a huge razor teethed gaping maw on legs with her head dangling round the back and there are some nice moments such as Griggs starting to transform. Unfortunately the rest does seem rather unoriginal and dull simply utilizing the age old tentacles notion that doesn't really fit with the original and with later designs that looked like a Sarlacc with legs or something from the Resident Evil franchise. One thing that did disappoint me was the lack of info on the creature, I was really hoping for some insight on its background. Where it may have come from and why? how and why did it crash on Earth? is there an entire race? why so hostile? assimilate for food? what does its original form look like? were there more inside the ship seeing as its so huge? how did they create such technology originally and how do they pilot the ship in their form? etc...So many questions but you get nothing which is a shame really, maybe some don't wish to know but I'm just real curious.The whole film does seem a little pointless I admit as we can all guess what happened before the creature makes it into Carpenters film. But I do think they addressed the continuity quite well despite one or two issues and I loved how they made this prequel flow perfectly into the old original.Not really scary or that dark and foreboding but its not too far off. Not sure what is suppose to have happened to Kate in the end and the whole dog ending also made me think why not just run off in that form right from the start?My final thoughts...I quite liked it, better than most are saying methinks. My advice is simply watch this then the original Carpenter film straight afterwards and this film actually does seem a lot better than you might have previously thought, they do connect together nicely.6/10",The Thing
91,KnightsofNi11,An uninspired prequel,5,15 October 2011,"In 1982 John Carpenter released his groundbreaking sci-fi horror masterpiece, The Thing. It involved a group of scientists in Antarctica who must divert from their research to deal with a mysterious creature that has infiltrated their research center. It's a creature that kills off people and then copies them perfectly so as to blend in with everyone else before they attack again. The creature came from another research camp located miles from their own, a desolate and abandoned Norwegian camp. What exactly happened in that doomed research facility has long been a mystery. All we know is that it was a disaster and it where the entire problem began. 2011's The Thing attempts to resolve that mystery by telling the back story of the events which led up to John Carpenter's film. However, in its attempt to fill the gaps and resolve the ambiguities this version of The Thing, to put it bluntly, does a very poor job.The Thing is technically a prequel, however, it is in many ways just a remake of the 1982 version. It follows the same basic storyline of researchers in Antarctica finding an alien and then being terrorized by said alien. Because of this, we know exactly how The Thing is going to unfold. It's not the film's fault, it's just a simple fact. This puts a major obligation on the shoulders of the film to be highly imaginative and original in its own way. Sadly, The Thing does not do this. It falls short of being a truly inspired retelling of the classic tale and it really gets to be nothing more than a straightforward horror story, and I use the term horror loosely. This version of The Thing possesses none of the raw terror that Carpenter's version elicits. It doesn't capture that same level of visceral suspense that leaves us on the edge of our seat every waking minute of the film. This version is congested with cheap jump scares and gross out moments that sicken more than frighten. What Carpenter did in 1982 just couldn't translate over to this new rendition as it disregards everything that makes the original The Thing such a masterpiece.I really try to judge films based on themselves alone. I try not to critique films based on other films as I feel like every film deserves to be judged individually. But when you have a film that is more or less purposely identical to its predecessor there's no other way to do it. As is the case with The Thing. I have to compare every element of this new version with the 1982 version and it clearly highlights all the flaws with this new version.However, the one region where I thought the 2011 version could really surpass the original would be in the visual effects department. And oh how wrong I was. The creature design in The Thing is excellent, I can give it that. There are some very well designed monsters. Unfortunately, it is the CGI renderings of these wicked monsters that lets the design down. There is just something about the CGI in this film that just simply isn't good. It looks fake, it looks cheap, and it looks sloppy. If anything, it makes me appreciate the stop motion effects of the 1982 version so much more. I still have vivid images of the disgusting creatures from the 1982 The Thing, but I'm sure I will quickly forget the underwhelming designs of this new version.It's sad to see a prequel to one of the greatest films of the 80's go down in flames. Overall, as a film on its own, The Thing isn't terrible, but it isn't very good either. It didn't amaze me and it didn't do any of the things that a good horror film should. But when you compare it to the 1982 version it is a very bad film. It simply gets everything wrong that Carpenter's version got oh so right. Watching The Thing doesn't make you sick to your stomach its so bad, but it severely underwhelms you and has nowhere near the same affect as Carpenter's immaculate version. 2011's version of The Thing won't be remembered and people certainly won't be talking about it 20 years down the line. That role is reserved for John Carpenter's 1982 masterpiece.",The Thing

93,petra_ste,Failed imitation,5,17 December 2014,"I love John Carpenter's The Thing - a true horror masterpiece, with a bearded Kurt Russell fighting a shape-shifting monster in an isolated Antarctic outpost. The best Lovecraftian movie ever made along with Alien... even if, ironically, neither of them is an actual Lovecraft adaptation.While prequels are typically regressive and redundant, this is one of the few cases where the idea had potential: the mysterious events at the Norwegian base (""Hey, Sweden!"") made for an intriguing premise. Add to this a competent, lovely actress like Mary Elizabeth Winstead and you can't go wrong, right?Wrong, you can: this is really lame. If the titular monster had imitated its victims as poorly as this movie imitates Carpenter's, the protagonists would have cornered it in a minute. Set-pieces are weak and generic (nothing comparable to the legendary blood test scene), characters bland - while those in the original, although not particularly deep, were at least better sketched. Although rants against CGI have now become more boring than CGI itself, it needs to be said: Rob Bottin's practical effects in the 1982 film, with their visceral, slimy, repulsive PHYSICAL presence, leave this pixel blob in the dust.5/10",The Thing

95,Vivekmaru45,Obviously The Director Was Influenced By Carpenter's Version And Tried His Best To Imitate His Style.,5,25 November 2011,"People expecting this to be better than John Carpenter's The Thing will be disappointed. The effects in this film are cheap C.G.I. effects we have become so accustomed to in films like Avatar, Green Lantern, and Iron Man. The special effects in the film are horrendously executed and you can see that the FX guy is trying hard to imitate those effects in the 1982 film directed by John Carpenter. In past, real life model aliens were molded and used in the special FX. Rob Bottin(Robocop) did those in Carpenter's version. Other masters I like are Stan Winston(Predator), Doug Beswick(Aliens) and Screaming Mad George(Guyver).But these days people are so lazy and money minded, that they do not care for quality but go for quantity. The movies I saw during the 80's and mid 90's had the real creature FX.This film is meant to be a prequel to Carpenter's 1982 film, and so starts off when a Norwegian survey team on the track of a mysterious signal finds a derelict alien spaceship buried under a glacier. They also discover an alien life-form frozen in ice, which they carry back with them into their base camp. All hell breaks loose when this creature frees itself from the block of ice that imprisons it. The actors in this film are pathetic and lack character. In the past we had legendary actors the likes of Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, Lawrence Olivier....but these days.... Also there is no creepy background music score that is a requisite to this sort of film. Ennio Morricone did the awesome score in the 1982 film. Bottom line: John Carpenter should have directed this prequel himself and saved us the torture.Similar films: The Deadly Spawn(1983), Slither(2006), Shivers(1975), The Rift(1990), Leviathan(1989), The Puppet Masters(1994), The Alien Trilogy(1979-1986-1992).",The Thing

97,jdkraus,"Not so bad, don't expect the terror that John Carpenter brought 30 years ago",6,22 October 2011,"""The Thing"" is not a remake of John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name, but rather it's prequel. No doubt this film was made for the fans (like myself) of Carpenter's classic. The story is the same idea—a cryptic tale about a group of people stuck in Antarctica, who encounter a mysterious species that has the ability to assimilate organic beings. Unlike John Carpenter's feat, this movie explores more aspects of the alien species that was either left implied or unsolved in the 1982 feature, such as the physiology of the alien, the downed spaceship, and even how the thing ""assimilates"" other beings. The movie even ends where Carpenter's film picks up. These are some nice additions to the plot. What this film lacks though is the terror that Carpenter was able to capture nearly 30 years ago. Part of this is due to Carpenter's brilliant camera cues and direction. While there are plenty of jump moments in this film, I found myself chuckling at them instead of gasping. Another reason for this is the type of technology that was used in the production, for CGI is the modern day norm. Though CG looks good on screen (especially in this feature), it feels more cartoonish than real. The old effects of stop motion, puppets, and makeup design look far more real and terrifying, for there's a sense of depth and expanse in them that does not get transmitted in quite the same way with computerized effects. I also did not care much for the characters either. I knew walking into the theater that most of them were going to die anyway. I admit that I enjoyed watching Eric Christian Olsen play his mischievous self and the sexy Mary Elizabeth Winstead give intense, over-dramatic speeches while wielding a flamethrower. This movie isn't all bad though. It has some good cinematography, music, and a fairly decent story for a sci-fi horror flick. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time, wondering what was going to happen next. The die-hard fans of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" may be disappointed in this film, for it does not hold up to par. However, I enjoyed this movie.",The Thing
98,RJBurke1942,Where this first close encounter is nearly the last,7,16 June 2012,"Rarely do producers put any money into prequels and for a good reason: with little or no continuity as a hook, the scriptwriters can very easily ruin it. Moreover, prequels are just not done very often anyway.Fortunately, the production team here inserted prehooks, so to speak, in this movie to ensure proper continuity with John Carpenter's classic tale of terror. In other words, they included, for example, the logical sequence of steps required to produce the merged two-man monster found by MacReady and Dr Copper when they land at the burnt out Norwegian base. There are many others, all of which are detailed here at IMDb.com .So, for me and others, part of the pleasure of this story is waiting to see how many of the other prehooks are created. One of the best, for me, was the opening sound track that includes a few bars of Ennio Morricone's original score for the 1982 film. Delighful!The plot very much follows that of the original: the Thing is found, it takes over animals successively including humans, fire-fights ensue, trust is destroyed, there are frantic efforts to devise a test to expose the hidden Things, the base camp is gradually destroyed, the Thing tries to return to the space ship, most of humanity is killed by the Thing or each other, there is a final confrontation between human survivors and the Thing, humanity is finally victorious. Or so it seems. And so it is for continuity with Carpenter's movie, the beginning of which is shown while the credits roll for this one.Hence, as a stand-alone effort, it works and it is worth the time to sit through it. The casting is good, but not great – starting with the lead female, Mary Winstead (as Kate Lloyd) who desperately tries to do a Ripley Redux (from the Alien series) but fails to exude the same confidence and no b/s attitude so characteristic of Sigourney Weaver. Joel Edgerton (as Sam Carter) is a great MacReady look-alike and just as laid back and quietly cocky. And Ulrich Thomsen (as Dr Sander Halvorson), whom I've seen in many Danish/Swedish movies, is suitably fixated on getting a Nobel Prize (just like another in Carpenter's effort) and makes himself utterly objectionable. The other cast members perform up to the required levels: lots of screaming, shouting, cussing and so forth, all done with vigor.Overall, and despite what purists think and say, this is a technically sound production that deserves praise for a fine effort to help fill in gaps in the prior film. Better yet, the end of this movie ties in directly with MacReady's last line of the 1982 zinger, when he says to Childs: ""Why don't we just wait here for a little while... see what happens..."" Well, I could suggest that, in a little while, MacReady would see a snowcat rumble into the burning base from the north, with Kate Lloyd on board ready to burn anybody who can't prove s/he's human And, maybe she'll have a few Russians with her also. But will she still be human?Now, there's a sequel all Thing and terror fans should be panting to see – including me.But, enjoy this one first.

99,Neptune165,It's an okay movie,5,5 May 2019,A masterful job was done connecting the two movies especially in the final scene after the credits started to roll.

100,Darkside-Reviewer,More plot holes than ice holes,5,20 August 2020,"I am a huge fan of the original John Carpenter movie The Thing (1982) It's a horror movie I've watched more times than I can even count it's on every horror movie buffs top ten list. I was very much hoping that The Thing (2011) was going to be a new take on the original movies idea rather than it being a copy and paste reboot because let's be honest there was no way this movie was ever going to top the original so seeing a newer interpretation of it would have at least been interesting to see. Instead The Thing (2011) very ironically takes everything that worked about the original movie and attempts to copy it only without the charm and interesting character development the original movie had.One of my main issues with this movie is the ridiculous rivalry between the American characters and the Norwegian characters it just feels like lazy writing a lame attempt to create friction between the characters so they don't trust each other when it comes to finding out who's human and who's not. In the original (1982) movie the characters struggled to trust each other because of how well they knew each other they had reasons for suspecting each other and were constantly analysing each others behaviours and watching each others every move. In this movie hardly any of the characters know each other and certain characters can only speak Norwegian so they don't trust the Americans because they are foreign to them this of course creates mistrust but it's done so in the laziest possible way. The characters barely interact with each just point fingers at each other for the slightest thing.The action scenes are a mix of CGI and practical effects but all your attention is immediately focused on the over the top CGI creatures which all look relatively similar except for one of them which is the two headed creature which admittedly does look pretty good and has an interesting design that's similar to the burnt corpse from the original (1982) movie. This movie came out twenty nine years after the original and it's effects don't come any near to being as good as the originals which has some of most memorable and gory body horror transformations ever put to film.The end credit sequence reveals that the movie is meant to be a prequel to original (1982) movie which begins with the Norwegians hunting the infected dog down through the mountains all the way to the American base. I find it hard to believe that the director had ever even seen the original movie before filming this movie as there are just too many plot holes and continuity errors some of which are created in this movie for example in the movie one of the characters says to another that the nearest base is a Russian base that's over fifty miles away and given that they were already about twenty miles out from the Norwegian base in that particular scene then the distance between the Norwegian base and the american base would be roughly just over one hundred miles away suggesting that the Norwegians at the beginning of The Thing (1982) movie had chased the infected dog over one hundred miles by helicopter firing one rifle with presumably little to no ammo left in it the entire time never once hitting the dog and still having enough rounds to shoot roughly thirty rounds during the first minute in the opening of the original movie. That's just one of many flaws in this ""prequel"" movie.I recommend watching this on a streaming service like Netflix or Prime it's not worth paying full price to own it on 4K or anything and if by some miracle you have never seen the original (1982) movie do yourself a favour and watch it you will enjoy a million times more than this hour and half meh prequel.",The Thing
101,qormi,Excellent Remake!!!!!!!!,10,4 July 2012,"Okay, before I begin, I just want to get something out of the way. The alien can only replicate human biological features, right? Things like fillings, earrings, and metal plates are spit out, right? So how come all the replicants are fully clothed in whatever they had been wearing? Even if the clothing survived the yucky digestion process, wouldn't they be completely torn, wrinkled, stained, soiled, stinky, etc????? Major plot hole there.Anyway, the film was very suspenseful and the special effects were just as good as the 1982 film. The acting was terrific. The alien actually went berserk this time. I don't want to give away the ending, but it ended on an ambiguous note, like the first film. Only this time, it was very disturbing. The way they tied in the prequel to the beginning of the '82 flick was masterful.",The Thing
102,DonFishies,"Quite a bit to dislike, but not as bad as some make it out to be",7,31 October 2011,"Like most people, I was horrified when I heard they were making a prequel to The Thing. John Carpenter's landmark sci-fi horror film was a remake itself, but is so near perfect that the idea of making another feels like sacrilege. I was positively stunned when I finally got to see the film and have adored it ever since. Despite my admiration, the prequel idea still managed to intrigue me. Was there really a story to tell about the Norwegian crew that discovered the alien? In remote and desolate Antarctica, a ""specimen"" has been discovered. The specimen, an alien life form, has been frozen under a thick sheet of ice for what is believed to be hundreds of thousands of years old. It is taken to a nearby Norwegian research base for further study, and while the group that inhabit the base celebrate, it breaks free. After a hostile encounter, the group slowly discover that this alien, this titular thing, has the ability to infiltrate a host and imitate its structure near perfect – to the point where they would be unable to tell the difference between the real person, and the thing that is pretending to be them. Rather miraculously, this new rendition of The Thing maintains the same stellar amount of suspense and dread that plagues Carpenter's film. The film plays its cards carefully, toying with the audience just as much as it does with the characters. Who is really themselves, and who has been transformed? It is a question that the film picks up after a surprisingly lengthy opening set-up, and one that never lets up afterwards. It just keeps packing more on, always maintaining the dreadful atmosphere it sets up for itself. It even manages to throw in a few fairly scary moments, even if the majority is made up of jump scares. While some shots are eerily reminiscent of Carpenter's work, director Matthijs van Heijiningen Jr. manages to make the film feel fresh enough both for those nostalgic for the original and those totally new to the film. van Heijiningen should also be praised for how effective the film works as a prequel. My initial fears were put to rest after the film started, and I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw on-screen. The film is set in Winter 1982, and you can see the immense amount of painstaking detail put in to make everything appear like they came right out of that exact time period. The film could easily be watched side-by-side with Carpenter's, and it would look like they belonged together. Rather surprisingly, it also adds in a few new tidbits and details Carpenter's did not, making for a few interesting new ideas. But this manages to also be the film's undoing. On more than one occasion, it paints itself into a corner and forces the storyline to conform to the continuity set in Carpenter's film. It makes for a great many turns that should not be taken, and a few elements which feel like they were simply added just to point out to discerning fans how certain things came to be. It really lessens the effect of the film, and makes it a lesser work than it should be. I like that they decided to make a prequel instead of a remake, but they should not have been hindered by what came before it. I know some changes would not have been forgiven (especially the ending), but I think a small few easily could have been if they were done creatively.What also could have been done a bit better were the effects. Some are just as astounding as they were in 1982, but others just look silly and overdone. I enjoyed seeing the alien when it was not imitating a human, but van Heijiningen shows it a bit too often. The beauty of Carpenter's film was its makeup effects and how little you actually got to see the monster. Here, it seems like makeup effects come secondary to seeing the alien appear and disappear. It takes away from the mystery of it all, and in some cases, it feels just like any other generic monster/alien movie (albeit, one with a great atmosphere). Much like the overactive need to fulfill continuity, it dampens and lessens the effect it has on the film. Acting wise, there are sadly no particular standouts. While it was enjoyable seeing Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a strong female lead in the vein of Ellen Ripley, she lacks the charisma and spunk to really carry the film from beginning to end. She has moments of greatness sprinkled throughout, but I do not think she has quite managed to lead a film. Joel Edgerton is great in small doses, but the script never really gives him any moments to shine. He seems like a significantly scaled back version of Kurt Russell's character MacReady, and his appearance and actions do not seem to entertain the idea that he is not trying to be. Much the same goes for Eric Christian Olsen, the only other recognizable actor in the film. He works when he has something to do, but he never seems to get enough. While there is a lot to like about this prequel to The Thing, there is quite a lot to dislike as well. It is surprising to see all the detail put in to make the film a genuine and faithful predecessor to Carpenter's original masterpiece, but there is a lot done to make the film a lesser picture. It is a really uneven experience, and one that fans may find the ability to appreciate more so than people who have never seen the film it is based off of. It is worth giving it a chance, but just do not expect a lot to come out of it.7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",The Thing
103,mahmus,"Solid at times, bland at others.",5,9 November 2020,"This prequel (Not remake. Stop calling it a remake) has a lot going for it, but ultimtely falls short of the brilliance of the original due to some pertty bad CGI (it was originally going to be practical and it looked much better) and it feeling too similar to the 1982 version, to the point that people actually call it a remake (Stop it. It's not a remake).On the other hand, I do like how it connects to John Carpenter's version in how it tells the story of what happened to the norwegian base. Seeing how the pieces fell into place to end up like in the '82 version was pretty cool to see.Overall, it's a mixed bag, but not one I regret watching.",The Thing

The whole ""monster frozen in ice"" idea is great, but this time it is turned on its head, by turning the monster into an alien (complete with a spaceship). All through the movie suspense is built and keeps building even after the alien is unleashed. The whole movie is spent straining your brain just trying to figure out whose identity the alien has assumed. Granted the plot is predictable, but the movie is still very suspenseful as people who you think might be the alien, keep dying left & right, just proving that your suspicions were wrong all along.Good gory- thriller movie, 7/10.",The Thing
106,Bababooe,Garbage! I was compelled to write a takedown after viewing this mess. Wardrobe?,1,5 February 2019,"Antarctica? The Original 1951 Thing was set in the Arctic, North Pole. 1982 version Antarctica. Ok.The intro, Norwegians, Lars and a couple of others, riding a snow truck crash through the ice. How did the hell did they get out? We will never know. Failure, right from the start. I liked the joke though, so at least that's something.Ok, Dr. Halvorson and Finch hire Kate, an American biologist or something to investigate the ship. They discover an alien frozen in ice and the genius Halvo decides to drill the ice to get a blood sample of the alien. For What? Just plain stupid. This guy is supposed to be a scientist. Just shut the movie off at this point. These brainiacs are contaminating everything. It wouldn't happen. Halvo also orders that they shouldn't communicate this to the outside world. Oooh, intrigue. Add suspense. Who's the genius who came up with this script detail. Kate objects to the blood sample. They had to find a way to make her smart. Rather than impart intelligence to her, they made everybody around her stupid. Kate is played by pretty manikin, Winstead. Winstead has one look on her face throughout this ""film"", open mouth and eyes in bewilderment. Folks, we have a film of supporting actors and extras in lead roles.After the alien blood sample, out ""heroes"" are drinking beer, playing guitar, beer bottle percussion, and singing old Norwegian songs. Why? Because they'll all be famous for finding an alien life. No worries of contamination. Not at all. Anyway, alien escapes, absorbs a no name Norwegian and it's burned. Now, check out the alien autopsy. I'm no surgeon, but surgical gloves alone won't do. These fools are in regular clothing reaching into this creature's guts, wearing no mask. Come on! How can we take this seriously? Ok, so Kate, our hero, discovers that the alien absorbs it's pray, then copies its victims.Plot hole: The alien copies the humans and dogs. How does it copy its wardrobe? We will never know. It can't copy dentures. Or earrings, more on that later. But it copies clothing, all nice and clean.So, the Norwegians are absorbed or killed. Kate and Carter, the helicopter pilot follow the alien to the spaceship. The alien turns on the ship. A 20 million year old spaceship that still functions? Failure. Kate bombs the alien and shuts down the ship. Kate then kills Carter, because he was not wearing his earring. Noting that aliens cannot copy earrings, but they can copy wardrobes. Was male earring popular in the early 80's? Just asking.Ok, so what happened to Kate? We will never know. Last we see of her, she's in a snow truck. She probably froze to death with the same look on her face throughout the ""film"", open mouth and eyes in bewilderment.Then we are treated to a tie in to the 1982 film. All of a sudden, the producers contrive Lars' survival. This movie is a mess. I did not go over every single crappy scene. For instance, Collins disappears, then shown standing in an office, later show to commit suicide. Somebody should be in trouble for script and editing here. Anyway, to really appreciate how bad this movie is one should concoct a college course to tear it apart. The original 1951 movie was also a mess. It had some decent ideas, muddied by dumb jokes and ridiculous romance. Just a tragedy. But for its time, at least it had some ideas. 1982 had tension. I do not want to re-watch it again, so not to discover all the plot holes and nonsense. 2011 version. Forget about it. Garbage story. Plot holes. We have a pretty scientist, mouth open and eyes in bewilderment. We have Halvor always doing dumb things and being irritating. We have Carter, Kirk Russel copy. Extras in lead roles. No name Norwegians only for pray. Basically, a bunch of loser characters, in an fx cgi monster movie, within a derivative bottom of the barrel story. I ask again. How did the alien copy the wardrobe?Plain and simple. This is not an intelligent movie. It has no reason for existing. It's dumb. And you will lose intelligence when watching. Written and produced by untalented, incompetent, derivative filmmakers. What a shame when talented filmmakers are bypassed because film studios invest in such garbage filmmakers.We have no idea where this ""thing"" came from, what it is, what it wants, why it's here. Nothing. So, this ""thing"" has the intelligence to travel to earth and it's running around in the Antarctic killing people. Wow!This movie sucks and so does the 1951 version. I will not re-watch the 1982 versions so I don't destroy the nostalgia I felt when I saw it in 1982. I recently re-watched Carpenter's Fog. It is confirmed crap. No nostalgia or blind faith from me for Carpenter. I recognize that Carpenter knows his craft. But I do not recognize him as a genius artist.",The Thing

I mean it's nothing fantastic, and for overall uneasiness John Carpenter's film gets that award hands down, but this version is still definitely an enjoyable sci-fi/horror.This is actually a prequel to the events in Carpenter's movie, which was a good idea I think because when you watch Carpenter's movie, there are parts where you wonder what happened to the camp where the Thing actually awoke, and what happened to the Norwegian scientists there (apart from the obvious I mean). This film fills in those gaps, and does a pretty good job I think.One of the things that has always had me fascinated with The Thing is the sheer remoteness of Antarctica, and the way it portrays how alone you are there and for me, that definitely adds to the overall feel of the movie.The effects in this one compared to the '82 film are obviously done with the aid of CGI, but the crew did work with an actual creature ""puppet"" so the actors had something work with. CGI effects were added later and as the practical effects were aided with CGI they do have a bit of a different feel to them. They just look more ""cleaner"" and there's more fluidity with the movement of the various parts of the creature like the tentacles, for instance. In saying that, though, they are still done well and have been kept to the same style as the original movie's creature looks.The effects are gory, but as I said earlier, they don't make you feel as uneasy as the effects in the '82 version. The '82 film is still one of the goriest and darkest films I have seen to date, and I've seen a LOT of horror films. This one is still not for the squeamish though.The Thing is a very decent film to watch, and even if you didn't enjoy the original '82 movie then you should still give this one a go.

Towards the end the film ventures into ALIEN territory by taking our heroine inside the spacecraft. As in 1982 the effects rely more on prosthetics and models than on CGI, and this helps to give it the same visceral quality as the previous version.Short on originality but long on excitement, this is a welcome escape from the stalk-and-slasher formula of most recent horror pictures.

112,t_atzmueller,"A good example, why remakes, sequels and prequels rarely match the original.",6,15 February 2012,"Perhaps there exists a statistic somewhere, but an educated guess what say that a remake has a one percent chance of getting anywhere near the quality of the original. This is especially true for remakes of cult-movies, which generally are considered perfect; ""The Thing"" is no exception.So, where did the 2011 ""Thing"" go wrong? For one, there is a thin line between paying tribute to the original and being a remake and ""The Thing"" crosses this line constantly, replicating entire scenes of the original. Granted, the film claims to be a prequel, which is technically correct since it ends at the exact point of time where the story of the 1982 film begins. Yet, due to the massive amounts of replicated scenes and characters, it still feels like a remake, disguised as a prequel.Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. is no John Carpenter; Carpenters boots are simply too big for the young director and why the producers would hand an ambitious project like ""The Thing"" to somebody who, so far, has only produced a video- and a short-film, is hard to understand. Perhaps an older, more experienced director could have salvaged something more but what we get here is more textbook-directing than inspiration.The harmony between CGI and 'real' special-effects is very uneasy, even, at times, uncomfortable to the eye; the idea of using traditional effect, many fans of the original, like myself, are not too fond of modern CGI, was a recommendable effort – but it's a marriage that was not to be.The cast, especially the Scandinavian actors, all relatively unknown to none-Scandinavian viewers, generally do a fine job but, again, cannot repeat the chemistry of the 1982 cast. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (even though still young, already something of a veteran of sequels and remakes), plays her role adequate and, of course, is pretty as a picture – but she is no Sigourney Weaver and certainly no Kurt Russell.Due to the fact that this film was produced by people who treated the original material with respect, many fans rooted for this film. As said, the chance that the 2011 ""Thing"" could compete with the 1982-version, was slim to none. What we got was one and a half hour of standard action cinema, some cheap thrills and a few moments of nostalgia.I'd recommend that you watch both ""The Thing""-films back-to-back – it should give a good idea what defines a standard- and a classic-film.6 points from 10.",The Thing
113,ebeckstr-1,Pointless,5,6 November 2020,"Some prequels work, and manage to create suspense even though we know where they ultimately will lead, because they are after all prequels.On the other hand, this movie, working from a poor script, seems to consciously abandon the idea of creating suspense in favor of being a generic monster movie.It also lacks internal logic. At random moments the creature seems to be going for hiding in human form, but then randomly and for no apparent reason at other moments it just turns into a big monster thing and chases people around. There are also moments where it could easily and secretly take someone over and thus make it easier for itself. But again, instead it turns into a giant loud monster and chases them around. In the end, this movie is like a 90 minute, lesser version of the velociraptor sequence in Jurassic Park.From a technical standpoint, the CG is that soft SyFi channel quality that completely takes the viewer out of the movie. The score is also uninventive. I really like the fact that there is a strong female lead, which was just beginning to become a little bit more common back in 2011. But that fact alone, even coupled with Mary Elizabeth Winstead's valiant attempt to retrieve something from the effort, is not enough to make this movie worth a second viewing (this having been my second time seeing it), and really not even a first viewing.The film's deficiencies make the achievements of John Carpenter's The Thing and Rob Bottin's practical special effects in that film, stand out even more.

They did a good job in elaborating some of the stuff and their story fitted into the original, explaining some of the stuff we see there. They also brought some fresh ideas.I felt the movie was mostly influenced by the original (in taking ideas from it, but not ripping it off like many other sequels do; actually, in one or two points they seem to deliberately try to make an analogy of a similar event seen in the original, only to have a different result) and also had a lot of influence from Alien.While the movie is definitely a suspense like the original, it sometimes feels like an action movie.The effects were surprisingly good and stayed VERY close to the form seen in the original, while - again - tried to elaborate a bit and explain some of the stuff. While the effects in the original were obscured and sometimes not shown on screen at all, here they are shown explicitly. Again, it brings the analogy of Alien in which the creature was mostly obscured and hinted, while its sequel Aliens showed the creatures more explicitly and relied more on action.The CGI guys did a decent job and shown us some cool effects, but Rob Bottin's practical effects and animatronics are still much better and seem a lot more real. This movie uses mostly CGI, but its practical effects are pretty good too.While I didn't expect it to come close to the level of the original, I WAS waiting to see this movie. I prepared myself to be disappointed, but I wasn't. It's an enjoyable film, it stays reliable to the original's story and ideas, and gives some background to the events seen in the original's beginning.

118,kgprophet,Never do a Remake of a Classic,4,19 March 2012,"Studio executives should have this phrase made into a huge sign and plastered on their office wall. You are doing nobody any favours by taking a revered classic film and trying to remake it, just because you have better technology. They certainly didn't have a better story. Many things are borrowed from the original John Carpenter movie in the story arc. There is only one extra 'Close Encounters' bit of CGI at the end that isn't in the original. Oh yeah, and a couple females this time. However, you don't sit there with a sense of wonder as you sit through several minutes of big CGI effects. Spielberg learned that over 30 years ago, releasing ""Close Encounters"" without ever showing the inside of the spaceship. The same thing did little to elevate ""Super 8"" or the well executed first ""X Files"" film.The script seems very lost, compared to Carpenter's very well paced momentum. Pardon the pun, but this crew of arctic scientists discover this thing at a glacial pace. There is this ""stupid gas"" that slows down the realisation that this alien is hard to handle. And forget if you have the original in your own movie collection like I do. You get the sense of deja-vu within the first 15 minutes. I have a special appreciation for practical make-up and gore effects compared to CGI. I guess if I could tell that most of what I was seeing in this prequel was CGI, then it wasn't good enough to creep me out. Still, the 1982 version of ""The Thing"", with the work of Rob Bottin, stands as one of the best gore films ever made, next to perhaps the original ""Dawn of the Dead"".",The Thing
119,dvc5159,The Thing from Gillis and Woodruff,6,25 October 2011,"John Carpenter's horror classic ""The Thing"" still stands among the great horror films in my opinion, with Carpenter's stark vision of an ominous, chilling atmosphere combined with Ennio Morricone's effectively eerie and subtle score, terrifically gruesome special effects and gore by Rob Bottin, and no-nonsense performances by Kurt Russell and the cast. Itself a remake of a 1950's sci-fi film, in today's times a remake is basically inevitable. Director Matthijs von Heijningen, Jr. and his crew took a wise move and basically shifted from remake to prequel as even they know that it is impossible to beat the great Carpenter.So as a prequel, it follows the original's footsteps more than it misses - there's no love interest, the Antarctic setting is always chilling in every sense, the characters waste no time to get to know the others, and the effects are gruesome. All of this nods to Carpenter's film not as a rip-off, but as a homage and sign of respect, as von Heijningen manages to make his version stand out on his own.For my two cents, I've always thought Mary Elizabeth Winstead deserved another lead role. Here she is tough and no-nonsense, smart, and doesn't downplay nor exaggerate the danger posed to her - establishing herself as an effective leading lady. She could have more confident roles later. I didn't really care for Joel Edgerton and the rest of the characters as they are basically stock characters from many horror movies of recent years (as opposed to the men-only group in Carpenter's whose character traits are defined by their fear and determination to survive) but they did an OK job, and it's good to see Norwegian actors speaking in Norwegian a lot of times to complement the English actors. Michel Abramowicz's cinematography is competent but sometimes lush, capturing the Antarctic scenery, eerie night-falls and awesome special effects in all their glory. The editing is not choppy allowing the audience to savor (and cringe) at every CGI splatter scene.Where this film succeeds is in its visual effects. Rob Bottin's practical effects in Carpenter's are still prime, but Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr. has managed to make some of the most gruesome creature/CGI effects I've seen in years. If Bottin built it then both Gillis and Woodruff modernized it with care and respect for Bottin. This stuff is not for the faint of heart.I don't like some aspects of the film. Bottin's practical effects are sorely missed, no matter how good Gillis and Woodruff tries. Marco Beltrami's score is too noisy at parts, making some scenes lose their tension completely, as opposed to the perfect timing and subtlety of Il Maestro Ennio Morricone's 1982 electronic score. There are some anachronistic goofs that contrasts with Carpenter's version which is a turn off and makes the film lose part of its strengths, however well- handled it is by von Heijningen, Gillis, Woodruff, Winstead and company. The climax of the film is somewhat goofy, too.At the very end of the movie however comes what I think is my favorite part, an epilogue which connects this prequel directly to Carpenter's version, complete with Morricone's original eerie theme ominously playing in the background. If only the rest of the film was more like this, originality unfortunately be damned in this day and age.Having said that, this is not a bad stand-alone film, although die-hard fans of the Carpenter version will no doubt be annoyed at the goofs. As it stands, the effects alone are worth the price of a ticket.People complain that this movie is a rip-off, and director's should try their own way. Look at what Marcus Nispel did to ""Friday The 13th"" and what Samuel Bayer did to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". MTV directors making their own versions, straight for the MTV-laden generation - quick cuts, unnecessary sex appeal, flashy cinematography, bad timing of music, etc. For this ""Thing"", It's nice to see a newbie filmmaker remembering the greats and sticking close to the good old-fashioned way. I hope von Heijningen finds his true visions in the near future as he looks like a promising director.Overall rating: 64/100",The Thing
120,jayjaycee,"Hans, get ze Flammenwerfer!",5,15 June 2020,"""The Thing"" is a 2011 sci-fi horror film directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton. It has been more than two years since I have watched the legendary science fiction horror classic ""The Thing"" by John Carpenter for the very first time. As if it was yesterday, I remember how it heavily intrigued me and gave me a phenomenal time. What makes this film so utterly terrifying and at the same time celebrated, aside from the infamous and outright gross practical effects, is the irreplaceably nerve-racking atmosphere it creates in a wonderfully paced manner. From the beginning on, you know that something dreadful is going to happen at that station, but it is far from what you can ever imagine. Before it begins, you gain an insight in what has already happened at that Norwegian station where it all started off and those horrible images make you wonder, just like R.J. MacReady, what in the name of God has happened there. Carpenter deliberately presented the audience with a fait accompli, and that was what made it so bloodcurdling in the first place. After the credits rolled, I contemplated a while and thought ""Wouldn't it be interesting to see a movie that shows the ghastly events at that Norwegian station?"" and thought it would be indeed a decent idea. As if my prayers have been answered, I then found out that the 2011 movie what I thought was only a remake of the original classic, turned out to be exactly what I wished for. Regardless of its overall reputation, I was still curious to at least check it out once, but I haven't been able to obtain a copy of it. Only last Sunday, while straying through the vastness of Netflix to find a decent film for the evening, I unintentionally stumbled upon this long looked for flick and gave it a watch one week later. Just as the aliens in this franchise, some things should stay buried, isolated from humanity by metres thick ice and should never see the light of day at all - this film is one of those things. In what cannot thoroughly be categorised as neither remake nor prequel, we get to experience exactly what cruelties occurred at the Norwegian research station of which only the remains will be discovered in the 1982 film. Not to mention how this film relatively demystifies the original film, it doesn't add much new or innovative to it. Much to my general confusion, the film literally depicts the exact same plot pattern of its ""sequel"" and doesn't even try to be creative. Naturally, the crew unleashed and then fights the exact same extra-terrestrial entity that later on will also eliminate the American station, but in terms of filmmaking that does not entitle the director to blatantly copy the same formula of the classic. I am aware that both are based on the same short story and that it also poses as the main influence of this film, but since it officially declares itself to be a prequel rather than a remake of John Carpenter's masterpiece, I am not only perplexed but also heavily disappointed to see the exact same film - only that this one is inferior and much worse in terms of quality. The setting is almost the same as back in the day, and yet it doesn't manage to build up a minimum of tension. Except for Winstead, Ramona Flowers herself who happens to be the female counterpart of Kurt Russell's MacReady and channels severe Ripley vibes, all other characters are extremely bland and terribly underdeveloped. It might be possible that my knowledge of Norwegian wasn't sufficient, but I cannot even tell you what their names were. Except for Kate and Carter (Edgerton, underused but principally not bad, despite being a pale imitation of MacReady), I couldn't care less about them all. The screenplay did little to nothing to give the characters at least a minimal touch of a personality and marked them out to be cannon fodder from the very beginning. For instance, when someone died, I was like ""Wait, who was that again?"" and wasn't upset about their demise in the slightest. But that wasn't even all. To my astonishment, the movie went into a new direction but did something it shouldn't have done. It is almost ridiculous that the only change the film dared to do resulted in the loss of the story's principal strength. Carpenter's classic was defined by the atmosphere, the psychological horror and the mind games it has played with the audience, as each and every character acted somewhat suspicious in their own way. This film relinquishes to build up any form of atmosphere, paranoid feelings and suspense and counts on graphic effects instead. Also, some major plot holes (how was that guy in the helicopter all suddenly infected?) and scenes that blatantly gave away the identity of the thing made it even worse. It just made me sad to see that most of the film was obvious and that it has eliminated the biggest strength of the original. Even if most of the CGI creatures were acceptable and nightmarish enough to mildly disturb me, it cannot be denied that the film majorly focussed on graphic action rather than psychological horror. While I was still sort of curious in the beginning, I was just bored in the end. That final act in the spaceship, with the final computer-generated creature that used to be Kate's boss was not only unexciting, but also painfully generic. At least they bothered to set up the connection to the classic film, and even if I am still confused about Kate's whereabouts (did she die or what?), I was glad to see that they managed to wrap it up properly. All in all, this prequel (?) is much like the first film, but is not anywhere near the quality of it. It is like they wanted to do the total opposite of the original film and made it intentionally bad. What could have been a genuinely great opportunity to create a magnificent backstory of a classic film, ended up being a forgettable and cheap imitation of a holy cult classic that lacks the heart and soul of it and eliminated the psychological horror aspect in favour of creating a more mainstream orientated, generic action flick. It's obvious that this film only functions as an uninspired cash grab and that is nothing but a shame. Despite my love for the lead actress, this film is just terrible and has countless heavy flaws and suffers from so many grave problems. This film is like the assimilation of the original classic: At first it looks like it, pretends to be it, but is ultimately exposed as something alien that doesn't have the humanity of what it tries to pose as. The only appropriate solution in this case is to kill it with fire, let it die and wipe its existence off the face of the earth. Having said that: Hans, get ze Flammenwerfer!",The Thing
121,jhpstrydom,Excellent prequel to a brilliant early 80's classic.,7,12 April 2012,"This prequel was one huge surprise, the best part about it is that it added a lot to the whole concept and it didn't miss a single bit of detail from the original and if you want to know what I'm talking about watch this film and the original back to back.The acting is superb all around, as for the creature effects, lets just say the effects in the first film grossed me out, this one also came out with a few gruesome moments but between the two this one matches up very nicely in terms of being gross.All in all, its not better than the first one, I'd say its pretty much equal to it and fans of the original movie will be very pleased with it.",The Thing

124,Meven_Stoffat,It's as if it were designed for people with low attention spans,5,5 November 2011,"In this day and age of remakes, prequels and reboots, and other endless franchise padding, it only seemed inevitable that John Carpenter's The Thing, which forever became known as a cult classic after it tanked hardcore in cinemas, would get the honour. Or is it a dishonour? That certainly seems inevitable, as the reaction to the fact it is getting a prequel of sorts got a mixed reception when announced some time ago. A fan of the original film, I tend to take a disliking to prequels in general. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but I find prequels tend to ruin what you liked about a piece of work in the first place. Remember Lucas' three-part turd he dropped on us some time ago? Yeah. Let's not go there. But, if done right, a prequel can be entertaining. This year, two prequels got released that entertained me lots; X-Men First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. And then, this got released.The film is essentially a prequel, or so it says, to the 1982 remake of the '55 film. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World) is a brilliant, young and beautiful scientist, studying in Antartcica. The Norewigans have discovered a mysteriously unknown apparatus in the ice, and invite Mary and her team to investigate. They stumble upon a gigantic ice block with a seemingly mysterious creature inside it. Thinking they have discovered something incredible, they transport it back to base, and celebrate.However, on the night of the celebration they discover the ice is melting faster than usual, and in a rather effective jump scare, the thing escapes. Now their doom has been sealed, and death, chaos and destruction is about to happen. The terror is heightened when they realize that there is no true specimen. It has a way of letting its cells get into the people and imitating them, thus turning into the thing itself.Now, I will say that there's a lot to love about this movie, but unfortunately there's a lot to hate about it too, and it gets to the point where you're not sure if you should think it's a good movie or a bad movie.However, I could very well be blowing steam up this film's ass, but I would consider it to not be a bad movie at all. First off, the movie is well shot, and has a nice atmosphere, though it doesn't have a scratch on the first movie in terms of the two. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic, and manages to make her character in the film totally believable due to her performance. The score is excellent too, it mixes in a higher budget film sound with the creepiness of Morricone's score.In addition, the special effects are nice. Of course nothing can touch the original's practical effects that make me cringe and gag lots yet still scare the hell out of me all these years later, but the digital special effects manage to impress. Problem is, that the magic of the effects are gone in this film, I couldn't be grossed out by it at all. Instead it's just... Digital.However, there is a fair deal to hate about this film too, like I mentioned. For one, the most obvious being that this just seems too much the same as the first. There's even the obligatory ""we must have a test of some sort to see who's real"" scene that was done incredibly much better in the 1982 film. And the only reassurance that it's a prequel is the scene during the credits at the end, which, while the best part of the movie, all so simultaneously feels like an excuse for the film to say ""just in case you forgot, I'm a prequel!"". It just feels... there.Another thing about the film is that it almost completely missed the point of the original, as another reviewer on IMDb correctly put it. The thing has to be alone in the room with you for it to get ahold of your cells. This is completely urinated all over in the film, as if the writers haven't seen the original film. And this isn't helped by a big lipped alligator moment near the end, which in addition to being in a last act that tries to explain The Thing, features a scene where Kate jumps on top of the spaceship and a bizarre video/hologram thingy starts. A total nuke the fridge moment.In short, I don't know what to think about this film at all. It isn't bad, and I would watch it before the latest Michael Bay movie, indeed, but unfortunately, it seems all too obvious that this won't be one I can recommend. Not even to fans of the original, mainly because it's as if it were designed for people with low attention spans. That said, strangely enough, I would say it's worth watching at least once- that's just how polarizing the film is.OVERALL: 5/10THE GOOD: The Thing is a nicely atmospheric and shot prequel to the first movie, which features nice creepy tension and a good amount of scares.THE BAD: In addition to being a rehash, it seems like it's rather just the first movie designed for people with A.D.D. and methadone for The Thing addicts.",The Thing
125,flicklover,I should have stayed away!!!,3,5 April 2020,"I waited 9 years to finally see this film. I, in general hate remakes. I understand that John Carpenter's The Thing was also a remake, but really in name only. This new film is a remake/prequel. Even though it is made well, it has nothing to offer. No tension, or scares. The creature effects are mostly CGI. Pretty unconvincing at that. I get that Hollywood wants to remake old films that have an audience and introduce them to a new one. The story is basically the same as the 1982. A Arctic outpost in the middle of nowhere finds a creature freezes in ice. Supposedly, this story takes place before the events of the Carpenter film. But it is basically the same story. The creature breaks out and causes havoc. That's it. The difference to the 1982 film is that this time there are women in the cast. But there is truly no tension between characters. One of the great things about Carpenter's version is the tension that is built up when we don't know who the thing has imitated. Here there is no real suspense. It's fine to watch just to remind you of how good the 1982 film was. It ranges from being competently made and acted to downright laughable. Again the CGI is very unimpressive. The practical effects of the 1982 still hold up today.Stick with the John Carpenter version. This film is wholly forgettable.Grade: D",The Thing
126,loomis78-815-989034,Good prequel to Carpenter's classic,8,5 August 2015,"Before it gets confusing, it should be said that this is a prequel to the 1982 John Carpenter Classic which of course was a remake itself. Set in the winter of 1982 in Antarctica, this tells the story of the Norwegian geological station that discovers a frozen spaceship and eventually set loose the alien form that takes on the shape of what it imitates and attacks. Having seen Carpenter's film we know the outcome to this group when a group at the American camp goes to investigate. The question really becomes how the Thing destroys the camp. Writer Eric Heisserer cleverly gives us what we expect to see from the Carpenter film, along with new information. A nice new wrinkle reveals that the Thing cannot reproduce anything that isn't organic such as jewelry or in once case a plate in someone's head. This makes for some interesting (and tense) moments at several key moments including the ending. Director Matthijs Van Heijninjen Jr. and his sharp production design team make this a detailed homage and attempt the look of Carpenter's film. Some scenes do make this feel like a remake, but then this script takes a turn and surprises us going in another direction. Such as the blood testing scene, which sets up initially like a direct redo suddenly changes once a character announces that the blood samples have all been destroyed. The cast is good with Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the lead role and the movie certainly never gets dumb. The biggest mistake this film makes is mostly in how the Thing is seen. In the original MacReady announces that the thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. In this film, the Thing has no problem taking center stage and in one scene rips through doors and buildings talking out multiple characters in the process. Some of the mystery and tension of the original is lost because of this, and all though the digital effects are decent for the most part, they can't hold a candle to the amazing practical effects that Rob Bottin achieved in Carpenter's film. Heijninjen makes his film fun and entertaining and achieves a similar atmosphere and delivers some nice scares along the way. The decision not to remake the Carpenter film was a very smart one, especially in this world of constant remakes. Then take the fact that this film takes itself serious and is dedicated at being a true lead in film to the 1982 classic is quite remarkable. This film actually achieves the status as a true prequel that works hand in hand with Carpenter's original. Bravo.",The Thing
127,dommercaldi,Atrocious And An Absolute Embarrassment To The Original,1,16 May 2020,"Pros:
1. The sound design is the only redeeming quality about this film, and it does its best to breathe life into the movie.Cons:
1. The CGI monster and blood look utterly terrible, and they pale in comparison to the practical effects used in the 1982 original.
2. The score is played obnoxiously throughout the film, but especially during the first act in a weak attempt to build up tension.
3. The characters are not well developed, and neither are their relationships. This weakens the effect of their deaths and the ensuing paranoia which made the original what it was.
4. The action is over-edited and suffers from too many cuts, and they feel incredibly stale.
5. The pacing is way off, and the movie just feels rushed.
6. The movie is rife with plot-holes. For example, it's never explained how Carter (Joel Edgerton) and Jameson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) survived the helicopter crash. Moreover, apparently Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) didn't think to have a back-up of the blood test.
7. The film is imbued with cheap and ineffective jump-scares.
8. The ending which desperately tries to add credence to the movie by tying it into the original, is not only needless, but deeply offensive to anyone who loves the 1982 original.",The Thing
128,Ryan_MYeah,"It's a bit scary, and visually cool (even if the CGI is over done), but doesn't live up to Carpenter's version.",6,24 October 2011,"Halloween is coming closer, so I've been catching up on my scary movies, and one movie I've added to my list of ""have seen"" is The Thing, a prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing, itself a remake of The Thing from Another World from 1951, itself based on the story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell Jr. Wow, what a story this one has.In the film, Kate Lloyd, a paleontologist (Played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is brought to a Norwegian outpost stationed in Antarctica, after the researchers there discover a mysterious specimen trapped in ice. They bring it back to their base, and celebrate their discovery that would give them eternal notoriety, but the creature eventually thaws out, and escapes. What else? Kate discovers that once this creature kills its prey, it can copy it perfectly, waiting for its next victim. Tensions become high. Anyone in the station could be the thing.Again, this film is meant as a set up to the events of the 1982 film by John Carpenter, a film that is widely regarded as one of the greatest horror movies in history. Just don't expect it to match that level of quality. Some might place blame on debut director hard to spell and pronounce, but the problem lies more with the screenplay. It captures some of the same tension and paranoia of the original, but there's not quite enough characterization, and story elements that border on absurd, including the ending.And even if it's a prequel, it might as well have been a remake. In a lot of ways it plays out just like the original, with a minor exception to the now famous blood testing scene swapped out for checking for fillings in teeth. But even this has flawed logic. One character even remarks, ""So, because I floss, I'm the monster??"" I'm probably nit-picking, but that's my story.But you can at least thank the cast (Although, you probably won't be able to distinctly tell who a lot of the Norwegians are), including Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who gives off a commanding presence, clearly channeling Ellen Ripley of the Alien series. The film also features a very creepy sense of atmosphere. The production design is claustrophobic, the sound design exceptional, the music terrific, and the effects (Even if obvious at times) is good stuff. And even though their work might be overshadowed by CGI, let's not forget the conceptual design and make up effects of Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr.All in all, it's fine, even kinda fun, just don't expect something terrific out of it.

There are major homages to the Carpenter classic throughout the film which makes it an absolute blast to watch.

But fans off it should be pleased with this one. It fits perfectly with it, and gets everything right in telling the ""hinted at"" story that proceeded the 1982 flick.What the 1982 ""thing"" is most famous for though is its effects, and this one does replace the famously mind blowing special effects off that movie with run off the mill modern CGI here.

I was a bit skeptic as this is the story ""that shouldn't be told"", it might spoil the Carpenter classic, but I didn't care about it as much as some others.The look and mood of the movie are pretty spot on, I was pleasantly surprised. No superstar actors, European director, all looking good for starters, but the good stuff sadly ends pretty quick.While both the originals have a gripping story and atmosphere, for some reason I couldn't care less what happened in this movie after the chopper went down. Maybe I missed something obvious, but to me all the happenings seemed very random and the pacing wasn't that good. There is no tension or the same feeling of claustrophobia. And most importantly, there's no mystery!I also had a problem with the lead character who appeared to figure things out all the time out of nowhere. Most of the stuff is pretty obvious to us as we've seen the previous movies, but taking into account she was completely new to it, she figured out a lot of stuff very quickly and to the point. She was never really wrong about anything.There's good and bad things to say about the creature scenes. I liked the fact that it was kind of ""entertaining"" rather than very stomach churning realistic and serious. This is also a bad thing, since I didn't find the creature formations scary really, but almost funny at times. I think the creature was more scary even in the 50s version. It may be partly because it was shown a lot in this movie. Everyone knows that what you see is not scary, but what you don't see. That could be a problem here.Acting is OK. I was first a bit surprised to see Eric Christian Olsen, who I only remember from goofy comedies. Trond Espen Seim is a fun curiosity for the scandinavians who know him as Varg Veum, only he's not getting much to work here, very uninteresting character like most of the cast.I'd say it's more of a miss than a hit.

134,galahad58-1,A Decent Thing to Watch,8,15 October 2011,"The problem with delving into known territory is that you will be compared to the original project all the time. The Thing, with Kurt Russell, was a classic horror movie with a great cast and a wonderful screenplay. It built a suspenseful, tense atmosphere and was John Carpenter's top films. This project was smart to not do a sequel and try a prequel instead. The problem is that you know how the movie ends before you step into the theater and the filmmakers have to keep a sense of continuity between the two films. The acting is average and the need for American characters was unnecessary. The film would have been better served to have an all Norwegian cast. The story's beginning was a bit far-fetched and also unnecessary. There was no reason for an outsider to come to the camp and bring Americans with him. This could have been done in the same feel as the original where the scientific team already at the site did the work and the gathering of specimens. The look of the film was reminiscent of the original and the creatures looked good (but believe it or not--the non-computer generated creatures of the original were scarier). I gave the film an 8 since it did not disappoint, nor cover new ground. It was entertaining, but a bit lackluster in the fact that it could have given more insight into the alien and the ship to flesh out the series. The ending (prior to the chopper taking off after the dog) was an attempt for another film and that was one of the downfalls of many horror films in the past. The first film had more heart and characterization, this one had brief introductions to the characters just before they died.",The Thing
135,theinaniloquent,"""It's not human. Yet""",8,17 February 2012,"Within the year of 2000's, we have remakes, prequels, and sequels. Most importantly, people dare to touch classic movies that are not meant to be messed with. With this, I surely was a bit skeptical on the Thing, a movie that looked as if another movie. While watching, I couldn't help but think this is actually really good! Compared to the original, sure, it's really nothing special. But compared to the other movies that somehow get accepted into the cinema, this movie does a fine job... The movie begins with lots of build-up, and not slow at all. Your understand what's going on, and your wanting to see what's to happen next. The characters are easy to get along with, but it takes sometime to grow to them. I actually found the soundtrack to be really great, and seemed to be a tweaked version of the original, which was really cool. Of course there were a few flaws here and there, but they weren't out of control, like say the remake of Nightmare of Elm Street. The acting was pretty average. It wasn't GREAT, but it kept it believable to the point of you not questioning it. What I really enjoyed was how the film stayed to the roots of the original. Thankfully, the movie didn't copy and paste the film and call it new, they took their time making us think that this is a prequel to the events of the original. They carefully executed everything nicely, and I loved spotting out the subtle nods to the original. Most notably was the after-the-credits scene, where they perfectly placed the ending of this thing into the original's beginning. It was a nice throwback to everything John Carpenter did right. The thing that really had me disappointed was the whole UFO scene. I really can't explain why this threw me off, I just found it completely unneeded, and the movie could've been better without. The movie once again saves it itself from that fall with a brilliant ending. I highly recommend this film, but only for the people that can enjoy a prequel without comparing everything. All the bad reviews submitted on this website are non-credible, and are only comparing it to the infamous original! But if you can learn to get past that this is another movie, you'll be fine. I enjoyed the hell out of it. 8/10.",The Thing
136,rparham,This Thing a bit to much like the other Thing,6,14 October 2011,"In the current climate of remakes that has seized Hollywood in its grasp, up to bat in October 2011 is a new take on the short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, previously adapted twice before under the title The Thing. This new entry keeps the title, but isn't a complete remake, instead it is presented as prequel to the 1982 version, which was directed by John Carpenter and has become something of a horror icon over the years. Unfortunately, this new version of The Thing fails to match its predecessor. The film has its moments of suspense and tension, but for the most part, 2011's The Thing simply rehashes what came before, even though it is supposed to have happened first (it's like a filmic time travel paradox).Set in Antarctica in 1982, a Norwegian team of researchers has discovered a large structure under the ice, as well as being that had escaped from it. Called in by team leader Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) is paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who joins Sander and his research assistant Adam (Eric Christian Olsen) for a trip to the frozen landscape of Antarctica to discover that the structure is actually a ship, and the being is an alien. However, after the remains of the alien, incased in ice, are brought back to the camp, Sander demands a tissue sample be taken, which awakens the creature from its icy slumber to begin absorbing the members of the team. This creature can assume any form it wants, imitating the humans it consumes perfectly, only to be discovered if attacked. Kate, along with two American helicopter pilots, Carter (Joel Edgerton) and Jameson (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and the rest of the Norwegians, begin to piece together what the alien is capable of, and try their best to discover who is human, and who is the Thing.Despite being presented as a prequel to Carpenter's film, this version of the Thing fits more comfortably into the form of a remake, because it treads on ground well laid by the 1982 film. Where Carpenter went back closer to the source material in his film, which the 1950's version had deviated from quite a bit, this telling of The Thing lifts liberally from Carpenter's tale, and that proves to be largely its undoing. The Thing hits most of the major beats from the earlier version without really bringing anything new to the table. The Thing tries its best to build an unsettling atmosphere, and at times it works, but you can see so much of the big moments coming in advance that it drains most of the energy out of the proceedings. Like the 1982 Thing, this one features quite a display of grotesqueries in the form of churning, transforming people who grow tentacles, teeth, and various other appendages and orifices to consume the others around. The work is generally well done, but, again, it so replicates the same elements from the earlier film that the creature and its various guises stop being scary. The film is also hobbled by a relative lack of development of the characters. Winstead's Kate stands out, and proves a likable protagonist, but aside from her, the rest of the crew are largely one dimensional and interchangeable. Most of the names are easily forgotten, and while a few make an impression, you can't really root for anyone or get caught up in their plight.However, The Thing isn't completely without merit. First time director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. does deliver enough suspense at times to provide moments of unease, and a few of the standoff scenes in which the characters find them facing others who they are uncertain of their human nature ratchets up the drama. Henijningen and writer Eric Heisserer also do an admirable job of generally trying to match the elements of the film up to make sure it flows into the 1982 film, but this also reveals a slight weakness: by positioning itself as a prequel, you know how the story is going to end for the most part, so it saps a bit of the films energy.I can't look at The Thing with complete derision, it has its moments, with effective jump scares and atmosphere, but on the whole, The Thing is a bit too much ""been there, done that"" to manage to make a significant impact on the audience. In many ways The Thing resembles its title creature: it absorbs its predecessor, but unlike the creature, what comes out at the end is an imperfect replica.",The Thing
137,kevinxirau,Return of the gory shape-shifting visitor.,7,17 October 2011,"I'm happy to say that this is a well-made prequel to the classic sci-fi horror film. The filmmakers must have studied the original film by John Carpenter very closely in order to make this one work and, for the most part, it does.Now, we all know the story: American and Norwegian scientists find an alien craft buried in Antarctica for 100,000 years and find its shape-shifting occupant that breaks free and causes terror.It has a lot of the same atmosphere as the original and draws basically the same amount of tension between the characters. There's lots of new twists that keep the story interesting without interfering with the time line. Obviously the thing is portrayed through CG effects, which are quite impressive and not to mention scary.Someone clearly did their homework as this movie fits very well with the John Carpenter ""sequel"" from beginning to end.

Only a short story, but so good I read it several times over in the following years. At the time I didn't know it had been made into a film. When I saw the original film (The Thing from Another World) on TV, I recognised it but realised that to make the story last 90 minutes it had had to be padded out a little. It was further enhanced for the excellent John Carpenter re-make in 1982, with creature effects that were truly terrifying. All the more impressive given the fact that the effects were made using model and animatronic methods as there were no CGI techniques available at the time. This 2011 'prequel' is good, but follows more or less the same pattern as the 82 story, so perhaps it is better viewed as a homage to the Carpenter version. It is let down by the rather 'me -too' effects, which lack the repellent quality of the 82 film. Quite enjoyable though, and the final link of the running dog to the beginning of the Carpenter film is good.",The Thing
139,Rabh17,A perfect Prequel,10,13 February 2012,"Normally, I don't like Prequels-- (although, honestly, lately SEQuels have tended to be serial letdowns as well!) And I like that this wasn't an attempt to make yet ANOTHER version of the Thing, but just to give the viewer more tantalizing glimpses into what happened at the Norwegian base.They couldn't really 'Outdo' the Creature FX-wise. And anyone who's seen Thing 1982 intellectually knew that this version of the creature would just be a lead-up. The expectation on my part was of Mood & Chills.The other challenge was the fact that you already know: EVERYONE DIES. Well this movie and Mary Winstead as Kate swings you past that that poignant inevitability with consummate skill. Kate the biologist is believable and moving. You WANT her to somehow find her way to safety. And even towards the end, you almost think she just MIGHT. But instead of just succumbing to fate as a victim-- she glows, almost painfully, as unwilling heroine.And overall, where the 1982 'Thing' amazed and scared-- This 'Thing' gave me somber chills. There's something about Antarctica that just beckons for horror- the cold, the desolation, the isolation-- and this film --like the 1982 version-- brought the basic fear home to you: You are Not Safe here.My favorite chiller moment-- That first night after seeing the spaceship and the thing in the ice, Kate gets up and is looking out the plain wood & puttied glass window into the howling winter night. . .then she looks up. And the horns play that mournful warning dirge under the wind as she, and We, look at that sprinkling of stars out there on the Galactic arm: Cold, Distant, Unknowably Alien.""I'll never look at them the same,"" she whispers.Neither can we.

The cinematography is awful: why does the camera have to keep moving when it's a scene between two people talking?
The effects look like from one of those SciFi channel shows. The dialogue is terrible. And the attempt to change the test by looking for fillings? Really?
So many of these set up scenes for what we see in the John Carpenter version feel forced. Like that burned mutation they took back from the Norwegians camp. In this version, it's explained as two people merging, whereas if you look at the original, it's clearly one person pulling apart.
The ending is the worst. First, what happens to the woman. Does she just keep riding her snow machine around Antarctica until she finds a McDonalds? And having the woman survive to the ending? What a cliche for the past 20 years.
And who are those men who showed up at the Norwegians camp? Where did they come from, and the dog comes out of nowhere too.

I didn't fell any suspense, which is unfortunate, and a bad job done by the director.The only notable character was Mary Elizabeth Weinstead, she did a good job. Joel Edgarton didn't do much, and the rest were just there to be killed off. The Thing itself was visually unimpressive.It was a bad idea for them to have made a prequel. I hate to say it but if they were going to make another one of these films, just remake it, don't copy and past, get some new ideas, hell make it more like the old Howard Hawkes one with the alien resembling a human.

144,MF210,Not up to the standards of the 80's film but still a more than serviceable thriller,8,24 October 2011,"My Rating: *** out of ****Slight SpoilerIt would be a hard task to remake John Carpenter's The Thing, which in itself was a remake of the 1950's film, The Thing From Another World. Carpenter's film remains the best of his career, a claustrophobic, paranoid little thriller that contained groundbreaking special effects. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the equivalent of remaking Jaws or the Exorcist, but it's not too far off either. The 2011 version of The Thing is not technically a remake, it's a prequel to Carpenter's film. Still, the story is virtually the same and, to this viewer, everything was stacked against this film. While there was some passing interest from me, my expectations were not high. It seemed like it was exactly the same from John Carpenter's film except that it would contain CGI and more modern effects. Still, I wanted to see it anyway just for comparison.So, finally, how did it hold up? Surprisingly, it came through just fine. It's not an equal to Carpenter's film but it's certainly a better-than-average horror film, which is all you can ask for today. It does nothing to tarnish the reputation of Carpenter's film and doesn't seem like a carbon copy, even with it's many similarities. There's no disputing that the story is virtually the same, except that you do learn more about the origin of the creature. One aspect I liked with this film is that you learn the alien cannot replicate inorganic materials, such as fillings and nose rings. This is an important tip throughout the film and will have you looking more closely at the characters. One part of the film that you can't help but compare it to the original is the effects. A lot has changed in the 29 years since the last film and a decent amount of CGI is present here. It's, for the most part, tastefully done as the alien designs are very grotesque and mostly faithful to the original designs. It's a very gory film but not in excess. At times, the filmmakers are a little too showy but it's far from the problem it could've been. In conclusion, The Thing is a worthy prequel to a near-masterpiece of horror. No, it's not a necessary film that had to be made but it pays its respect to Carpenter's film without duplicating it. That in itself makes it worth watching.",The Thing
145,vailsy,More enjoyable than I expected but still lacking,6,7 July 2012,"The Thing (like Prometheus) had an impossible task ahead of it, living up to a movie that became in it's first decade, a cult classic. Once a film attains that status, it is impossible to satisfy the expectations of the fans. Probably then it was not a good idea to call this The ThingThat being said, I expected The Thing (unlike Prometheus) to be a B class movie and this most definitely is not the case. It's very faithful to the original (1982 one) and does actually feel like a prequelLike most fans I loved the non cgi effects in the Carpenter movie. The cgi effects here do look very good and faithful but they obviously lack the sliminess, fleshiness and chaotic imperfection of the original movie which matched with the nature of the mutated cell mimicking life formMy main complaint though is in the storyline which is more elaborate than it needs to be and becomes contrived.. we have one Thing getting away from the base camp and crashing. We also have the Norwegians enlisting the help of Americans because they are not capable of digging the creature out of the ice themselves.. naturally you can imagine a fiercely independent nation like Norway finding an alien creature, wanting to keep it secret and then going to the US for assistance. I don't think soThen we have multiple Things all over the place it seems, and we have the creature being particularly un-stealthy in it's approach when it doesn't need to be. For example, in a room alone with someone, instead of just approaching it's victim in disguise it breaks out of it's form first, chest teeth akimbo. So a lot of the suspense is removedI also found the ending rather disjointed, they make it fit the start of the 1982 movie with a large adaptor, but really it doesn't fit. It all feels forced and we have a very unnecessary trip inside the space craft and generally a lot of superfluous 'big' moments, again spoiling suspense potentialI am a stickler for good sound effects and one of my favourite things about the Carpenter version was the soundtrack. While the Thing's vocal effects are faithful, the wind is that usual gusty wind sample that we've all heard a million times in other movies, TV and commercials. The wind in the 1982 movie was far better, darker and more arctic sounding, like the original black and white movie actually. They nod to the 1982 score in the composition but the rest of it is pretty unmemorableThe acting is pretty plain too and there were no standout performances for me here, definitely there was no Kurt RussellOverall this is worth seeing as a stand alone product but I suspect this movie is the result of a eureka moment where they said okay lets essentially remake The Thing, but lets do so under the guise of a prequel and by giving it the same name. The movie is very appearance taking and Thing-like in this regard",The Thing
146,lnvicta,Pales in comparison to Carpenter's classic with nothing new or interesting to offer of its own.,5,23 May 2016,"It's hard for anything to compare to John Carpenter's The Thing. It's one of the greatest horror films ever made, some would argue *the* best. Thankfully, they didn't go the remake route here and instead opted for a prequel that depicted the events that happened in the Norwegian camp prior to the '82 version. In that regard, this movie does an impressive job at tying some knots like showing how the two-faced thing came to be, as well as the origin of the dog from the start of Carpenter's Thing. Sadly, that's where most of the praise ends. The Thing suffers from what plagues many horror movies these days - underwritten characters and overwhelming CGI. One of the scariest things of Carpenter's version is the practical effects of the ""thing"". They were horrifying. Here, all subtlety is thrown out the window in favor of huge CGI monsters. It's effectively used in a couple scenes, but the monsters lose their scariness after a while and it just becomes gratuitous. The characters themselves are paper thin. What helped make the '82 version so fantastic is that we got to know the characters, their quirks, their personalities, and we were able to empathize with their situations. In this movie, half of the characters are interchangeable. I didn't even know most of their names. And worse yet, I didn't care about any of them. There's one particular scene that calls back to Carpenter's infamous blood test scene where I realized that most of these people are really dumb and I don't care if any of them die. That's not good in a horror movie. By that point it was just a waiting game for them to get picked off one by one.The lead performances are strong. For the material they were given, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton do a fine job. But that simply isn't enough to carry a movie like this. The Thing is supposed to be scary, and for the most part, it isn't. That's a failure by horror standards. There's some face-value entertainment to be had here, but if you're looking for a substantial prequel to Carpenter's masterpiece, you'll be sorely disappointed.",The Thing
147,dmuel,"not bad, but not that good",6,8 December 2011,"This seems like an exercise in futility, given that there are already 230+ reviews of this film at this site. An alien creature is discovered and freed from the ice of Antarctica with horrifying consequences. This film is meant to be a prequel to Carpenter's 1982 film of the same title, but after an hour or so the viewer begins to realize it's nearly a copy of the 1982 film, with some scenes all but replicated from its predecessor. It does manage a few thrills, but overall it's a disappointment. If Hollywood took some risks, hired some worthy writers and let them finish the screenplay, not producers, it could have been much better. Special effects may lure high school students to the movie, despite the R rating, but they don't make for a good film. Before leaving, I have to add a few corrections to many of the reviews here. First, the original The Thing was not made in 1982, and not made by John Carpenter, but was made in 1951 by Howard Hawks. That film captured the communist paranoia of the cold war era, and Hawk's snappy dialog and well-paced timing made for an exciting movie despite a man- in-a-rubber-suit monster. Carpenter's 1982 remake of The Thing was truer to the ""Who Goes There"" short story by John Campbell, with an alien being thawed from the frozen Antarctic ice and assuming human identity. Carpenter's movie was also able to capture the anti-authority mood of the late 70's early 80's, particularly through Kurt Russel's quirky character in the film. Our latest 2011 entry seems intent on simply making money off the franchise, gives us a flat story with no real surprises, and offers neither a unique view of the plight of the characters nor any substantive conflict among them. Mostly it's a rehash of the 1982 film. What a pity!",The Thing

That is obvious, and I notice so called fans they say they are, are not understanding that this is a prequel. Do you think before you say something? I always wondered why prequels are always done after the first one. It is confusing, but not enough to call it something else that it isn't like most of these reviews. The thing about this movie is now they got the prequel out of the way. They will come out with either The Thing 2 or The Thing 3 or some kind of The Thing: *******.I got my frustration out on stupid people, and hope that they finally get a clue this is a prequel.

The guy in the video store said it was exactly the same except with different people and better effects. This is like 'Prometheus,' is to 'Alien;' the film before the film. They probably titled it 'The Thing' so that people would know what it was, but it is not a remake. I knew it was different from the start because in the John Carpenter version they go to visit an abandoned, trashed station of Norwegians, and this film is a mostly Norwegian team. At first I was a bit confused, but just went with it and figured it was some sort of reimagining, but if you watch it through the credits, they reshoot the beginning scene from the John Carpenter film. I could only assume the guy who wrote a tirade about this film not equaling the John Carpenter film did not watch it until the credits...and, frankly, duh. It is slightly similar to the original, but think about it. You're stuck in Antarctica and how many scenarios can you actually do? Also, it needs to synch up to the John Carpenter version as the tale that happened before that film.I do think the John Carpenter film was a bit more horror/suspense, and this one was a bit more sci-fi/suspense. It did have the horror element but the original was a bit more gritty. But think of 'Alien' and 'Aliens.' Both good films but the first had a more limited budget and so had to rely on the element of ""what you don't see is scary,"" where the second was more action and effects, big budget.I also thought this version was visually very cool with the imagining of what the alien and the ship is like. It's also well-acted and the main girl is likable. I also liked the fact that there were two female scientists. I hadn't really thought about the fact that the first was an all male cast until I saw this film, which reminded me how action films in the '80s were a ""man's world"" which is why Ripley as a heroine rocked the sci-fi genre, 'cause it hadn't been done before. But, let's face it, even though the scientist world is more of a male dominated field, women still exist in it, so, kudos for going that angle rather than another Snake Plisskenesque version.",The Thing

155,bushtony,Thing is...,4,4 December 2011,"...it could have been worse. And really, if it was going to cut the mustard up against Carpenter's masterpiece of tension, paranoia, suspense, macho characterisation and ground-breaking special effects, it was going to have to be something a bit special. Which, unfortunately, it isn't.The premise is perfectly respectable, the set up already having been provided by The Thing, which in retrospect is now the sequel to this, The Thing the prequel. The Norwegian crew from the first film find a spacecraft buried deep in the ice along with the frozen remains of an equally entombed ""visitor."" They get a pretty female American scientist to travel to their outpost to lend a hand with the examination of the find. The shape-shifting alien reanimates and sets about decimating seven shades of shinola out of the crew. If you've seen the first movie, you'll know most of this already – apart from the inclusion of the Yank chick. You will also know where this is headed, which sort of negates any consideration of who will survive and how. Although, the fate of Kate, our Stateside scientist girl, is ambiguously framed in the end.Comparisons with Carpenter's visionary genre piece are inevitable and unavoidable. Bill Lancaster's screenplay for that film rendered some great characters and characterisation; and delivered emotional engagement and punch. The dialogue was snappy, funny, cynical and sharp. The conflicting personalities at play worked to heighten the paranoia and suspense. It almost goes without saying, for those who have seen it, that the performances of Kurt Russell and company were mostly pitch perfect and believable. The sense of menace and isolation generated was part of the essential core of the narrative. The inhospitable landscape almost a character itself, used to establish a superb atmosphere and unnerving resonance.The new effort populates the story with flat and largely emotionless cardboard ciphers, representing a checklist of non-entities just waiting to get bumped off – much like the cast of a traditional low-budget slasher flick. It's amusing to see who gets it and how, but you don't really invest much emotional currency in the process. The CGI effects, which replace the grisly organic puppetry of the original, are technologically more advanced yet surprisingly less effective or convincing and are quite shoddy in places. Where the original dropped jaws, this drops credibility. And let's not look too deeply into the patent absurdity of trying to establish who is infected and who is not by checking to see if they have any fillings in their teeth. Not everyone has fillings. Or teeth for that matter.It's pretty much a by-the-numbers effort that feels almost as if it were put together by programming a computer rather than any meaningful creative human process of film-production. The atmosphere of the deadly, frozen environment and the crushing sense of isolation it should evoke are missing. You are never lifted out of the idea that this is a film and the cast and crew have luxury trailers to retire to once the shot is over and a cordon bleu chuck wagon is waiting off camera. It is not an immersive experience. It ends up feeling like a Sy-Fy channel original with a budget.On the plus side, the cinematography is crisp and clear – if unimaginative – and the use of the same fonts for the titles as used in the original is a nice touch. Also, if viewed as a prologue before watching the original I can see how it would represent a more satisfying experience. I wouldn't recommend it as a standalone film, but if it works to generate interest in seeking out and experiencing one of the greatest science-fiction movie thrillers of the modern age, then it will have at least performed a worthwhile service.Maybe we could use Carpenter's oft-suggested sequel about now.",The Thing
156,Paynebyname,Lazy and woeful,3,9 January 2017,"This really is shockingly bad and lazy. It had the potential to be interesting and it's own film, yet cops out with incredibly lazy writing that relies on the viewers knowledge of the JC version to fill in the blanks or make allowances for the amazing speed that the heroine connects all the dots.Stuff happens for happening sake or to look cool/gross out but doesn't advance or contribute to the story. At some points they try to make their own film, yet in others blatantly copy scenes and imitated shots from the JC version.To some extent I'm not sure if this new version is trying to emulate the alien by offering us a dodgy copy of the JC version that although tries to look the same is simply a lame, bogus and empty imitation.I've literally just fast forwarded through the last 40 minutes because it was so awful I didn't want it corrupting the kudos of the JC version.What a cheap, nasty, lazy tie in. The studio should be ashamed of themselves for so shamelessly exploiting the reputation of one of their classics for such a grubby, undeserving piece of crap.",The Thing
157,el7,Pretty mediocre.,5,11 November 2020,"The Thing from 2011 is a prequel to the 1982 movie also called The Thing, and that's a herald of things to come when you watch this. If you've ever watched The Thing 1982, you probably wondered what happened to the Norwegian camp. It's cool that we get to find out, and the movie starts very promisingly with some visuals somewhat reminiscent of The X-Files: Fight the Future, but not in a bad way. The movie-makers initially intended on using practical effects, and what we do see in the final product is really good, but eventually they decided to use CGI as well, and that's decent. The actors are good. The problem is, once you get past the initial setup, the story beats of The Thing 2011 start replicating the story beats of The Thing 1982 like the cells of the alien creature replicate the scientists in the research stations. We do get some disturbing visuals of the alien, which at first appears to be a giant crustacean, but as it morphs it develops more Cthulian features, so perhaps the crustacean features were from the host it used to get to Earth. This is fine but it still doesn't quite make up for the fact that by the midpoint of the movie you are no longer even remotely surprised by anything happening, nor in any kind of suspense. You're just watching to see who makes it out last, if anyone.",The Thing
158,adrongardner,Better than found footage,8,12 February 2012,"They could have gone the Blair Witch route with this but I'm glad they didn't. The original was a simple and well-made character study and this one does its best to continue within that framework.Having grown up watching the original many times, I think The Thing pays good dues to the original and while it provides no scares, brings a healthy dose of suspense in the face of assured destruction. My main complaint of the film is audiences are conditioned to seeing CG alien monsters run around. Why bother? The original made great use of limited effects - save the laughable Blair monster - and I think less would have been more here. It was true in 2001: A Space Odyssey and it is still true today - less is more.Mary Elizabeth Winstead anchors the film well. If anything she exposes the film' second main weakness. Namely, she is so good that the rest of the cast is largely perfunctory. The cultural differences provide a unique plot device and I believe could have been used to much greater effect.Overall after the ribbing it got from critics, I was pretty happy with the Thing. It could have used a few less monster closet encounters and more subtle suspense cues, but it's well acted, directed and solid nonetheless. I'm just damn glad they didn't film it on video.",The Thing
159,cstotlar-1,Terrible Remake,3,8 March 2013,"Next on the agenda - ""The Thing - A Musical"". As to why this film was made, I'd guess for an audience of young people who are either too dumb or too lazy to look up the movies before it. It is technically a prequel to the Carpenter film and yet it uses the same plot albeit heavy-handedly. The '51 version differed considerably from the source material but was at the forefront of the major horror film epidemic which ruled the decade and it scared the living daylights out of the audience. Carpenter's remake was much closer to the original text and became a classic in its own way. Then this hodgepodge. The lighting was so dim that parts could only be imagined from the remaining dialog. The pacing, rhythm, dialog, visuals, in short everything of any worth were sadly lacking. We could make a prequel of the prequel before the craft was discovered - or an epic of Norway... How about a prequel or a sequel to ""Gone With The Wind"" minus the stars, the talent and the budget? How about a pop version of ""Citizen Kane"" while we're at it.Curtis Stotlar",The Thing
160,RobertF87,Surprisingly Effective Prequel to a Horror Classic,6,3 December 2011,"Despite it's title, this is not a remake the 1982 John Carpenter cult classic, which was itself a kind of remake of the 1950s film ""The Thing From Another World"", and both of which were adaptations of the Joseph Campbell story ""Who Goes There?"" In Antarctica, 1982, a young American paleontologist (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is summoned by a Norwegian research team to investigate a strange craft buried in the ice and the frozen body of the occupant discovered a short distance away. Of course, before long the occupant is defrosted and turns out to be a malevolent shape-shifting alien intent on duplicating and/or killing anyone who it can get it's tentacles on.This is an entertaining blend of science-fiction and horror, which manages to be strong and effective. It has echoes of both the earlier films and fans of the 1982 version will probably enjoy picking up on little details which are taken from that film.It has an effectively claustrophobic and paranoid atmosphere. The problem is that there is not really much new. It doesn't stint on the flesh tearing transformations which were such a hallmark of the 1982 version, but they don't have the same impact that they had in the previous film. Personally I found the film enjoyable for it's atmosphere and genuine tension, especially towards the end.It's well-cast with Mary Elizabeth Winstead making a strong and engaging lead.",The Thing
161,JimmyCollins,Mary Elizabeth Minstead kicks mega monster butt in The Thing.,7,10 October 2011,"I haven't seen the John Carpenter original so i went into The Thing with no prior knowledge of that film, i did know that this was a prequel and that it had something to do with Norwegians, i have to say that i did enjoy this movie very much, even though it is a prequel it still seems as though it is it's own film without being linked to another movie in any way.It is the story of Kate Lloyd, a paleontologist who is sent to the Antarctica to inspect a life form that has been found, she has no idea that is an alien or that it is dangerous in anyway. It soon becomes apparent that what they're dealing with is not human, yet anyway. Hehe.The special effects in this movie are very subtle and realistic, no over the top cgi is used which is a nice thing to see, the monster/alien/thing is a very scary being indeed, the people who did the effects are brilliant. The chilly scenery of Antarctica is an eerie but lush landscape which is just as much a character of the film as the actors.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is as awesome as ever, she has succeeded to leading lady very well and she has a great screen presence and is very capable of carrying a film which is a lot more than i can say about a lot of other actresses. She's a very tough and smart female character, i think it's great that in a movie that a lot of males will watch that the protagonist is a female, its also worth mentioning that Ms Winstead is mighty powerful with a fire gun.Im not the biggest sci-fi fan so i cant say too much about this movie as i don't know much about the genre but i will say that it is a very entertaining, extremely well made sci-fi romp which will definitely please fans. :)",The Thing
162,McQualude,Big budget SyFy creature feature,4,29 August 2013,"BIGGER AND BADDER THAN EVER BEFORE!!! is what they should have called it. Because they basically eliminated everything that made the '82 version a horror classic: paranoia, awesome practical effects, suspense, horror; and replaced them with cheap jump scares telegraphed as to be ineffective, CGI Thing monsters (that admittedly look good) and one dimensional characters that mark time until their turn to die. Gone is the insidious creature from '82 that quietly replaces one or more of your coworkers leaving you unsure who to trust until your nerves are raw and you start to wonder if it wouldn't just be easier to kill all of them. Is the person casting suspicion trying to shift focus away from themselves or giving you a legitimate warning? The new Thing is a vicious monster with no clear goals except to KILL! and EAT! to the extent of working against itself. But really what else could we expect from Eric Heisserer who had some interesting ideas for the Nightmare on Elm Street remake but delivered such a mediocre script. I give the art team credit, the creature designs were nightmarish, arguably exceeding the '82 version and several of the creatures appeared to be practical effects. They also did a great job recreating the Norwegian base as it appeared in the beginning of The Thing '82. But all the best ideas were built from Carpenter's version and what remains is just your basic monster of the week that you might expect to see Saturday nights on SyFy.",The Thing
163,1bilbo,Doesn't hold up as well on second viewing.,6,11 December 2011,"Watched this for the second time this week, my first was at the cinema the next on DVD. Whilst this film is a good homage to JC's version it doesn't stand up as well on second viewing.1. How did the crew get out of the snow mobile when it was trapped in a massive ravine?2. The spacecraft burst into life, why after ¼ of a million years? Also there was a great opportunity to examine the inside of the craft – as in Hanger 18 - but that section concentrated solely on her getting away from the alien – which in reality she could not have done. 3. It was pretty clear in JC's film that the craft had either crashed and the alien ejected or the alien had landed in the wrong place and decided to go ""Dormant"" until it was found.4. The ""It's weird and .ed off"" type humour was missing.5. Childs is probably an alien at the end of JC's film so the ""Earring"" theory really doesn't hold up.6. The way the alien attacked was quite difference from the original – considering that it is only set a day later why would it change?In a remake/prequel of this type of film attention to detail is very important – there are quite a few other details which I find questionable and the heavy use of CGI took away from the sense of reality. The joining of the two faces was the most obvious and the spaceship left a great deal to be desired. Compare this to ""Star Wars – a new hope"" made before CGI had taken off – no comparison. This is still worth watching but fans of the original – like me – who virtually know the script by heart, will find the inconsistencies irritating.",The Thing
164,Minus_The_Beer,A Diet Coke Version of a Carpenter Classic,7,20 August 2012,"Remakes are one thing, but remakes masked as prequels to remakes from the '80s? Now that's a whole new ballgame. ""The Thing,"" despite its similarity in title to John Carpenter's cult-classic 1982 film is actually a prequel. But it's also a remake. Make sense? Of course not. Just go with it. The basic premise will sound familiar: a group of scientists holed away in the bowels of Antarctica make an earth (err, ice) shattering discovery that soon proves to be a deadly threat. It turns out a foreign life-form found buried in the ice is actually a lethal shape-shifting monster that consumes and then replicates its hosts, turning the entire crew on each other one by one. However, this story concerns the Norwegians whose mess Kurt Russell and crew were left to clean up in the original (remake).So how does it fare when compared to the coat-tails it's riding? Well, it's a mixed-bag, really. While Carpenter's film is notorious for boasting some ground-breaking practical effects that still hold up rather well 30 years later, this version will likely be remember for having quite possibly some of the laziest and most blatantly obvious CGI committed to mainstream cinema in recent memory. There are some truly grisly moments in the film that are virtually neutered by their presentation, which is perhaps the film's greatest short-coming. Granted, it doesn't help that the plot moves so quickly that you never get a chance to get to know (or care) about the crew, but a little more effort spent on making the effects look authentic would have gone a long way.On the upside, Dutch director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. has a strong visual sense that pays off big time. Granted, an isolated snowbound setting almost creates its own atmosphere, but the film does a superb job of immersing you in the bleakness of the situation, much in the same way Carpenter did with his film. Also in the film's favor is Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Death Proof) who is essentially stepping in Kurt Russell's shoes. While her character is barely expanded upon, she brings enough gravity to keep you caring. As the film shows, Winstead is truly one of Hollywood's most underused talents. In perhaps a more refined film, she could be this generation's Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton.The thing of it is (see what I did there?) that ""The Thing"" is neither a great nor a bad movie. It exists solely to serve a specific fanbase: namely Carpenter enthusiasts who have seen the 1982 film enough that they can quote the characters by heart. To that end, the film feels like a decent piece of fan-fiction come to life. As far as remakes go (and believe me, there's some bad remakes of Carpenter films on the market), this one is on the higher end of the scale. If you can get past the fact that it's essentially the Diet Coke version of a bonafide classic, you might get some thrills out of this new ""Thing.""",The Thing
165,bgaiv,Not bad to watch for free,6,8 October 2021,"I finally saw this when it showed up on a streamer. I'm a fan of the original, so I was mildly interested.""Mildly"" because I am so over prequels. Over over over over prequels. It's a very rare one that I like at all. Boring boring boring. It seems about all Hollywood does anymore is prequels and reboots. Basically squeezing their properties to death instead of making something new.Anyway, within the constraints of an immediate prequel, this isn't too bad an attempt, though the Thing does behave noticeably different.I liked the Ellen Ripley-esque lead character Kate, though they painted themselves into a corner since the original Thing began with the two males in the helicopter. Here, Kate is the clear lead then suddenly her story ends and it switches to the two guys. This doesn't work well at all. Also, it looks like they chickened out but going with the old cliche of the leasing lady character can't die, but she should have.That tends to make me suspect they hoped for a sequel with her character.And speaking of Ripley, since there are obvious parallels of the Thing with the Xenomorph, I'm thinking it could have been a lot cooler to have done a military sequel to the 1982 film, as was done with Aliens. The setup seems fairly easy considering both an American and Norwegian base were mysteriously destroyed, and that certainly warrants investigation by both parties.Back to this film, going back to the saucer didn't work at all. First, the video game-esque bit where they are trying to outrace the ship flipping up its whatevers. Goofy. Then the weird sci-fi thing Kate sees before being chased. Probably meant as a sequel hook, but the film just stand on its own, so this doesn't work. Yes, it's fundamentally a sci-fi story, but that's not the story we've been watching for the last 90% of the film.Then, as part of that sequence, Kate somehow avoids being taken by the Thing. There's probably some explanation, but it feels like the Plot Armor trope, so it's not convincing. Watching Alien and Aliens, I don't think Ripley ever had plot armor.",The Thing
166,DanLives1980,"John Carpenter purists, this is pretty damn good... mostly!",8,27 May 2014,"It's taken me three years to summon the will to watch this ""preboot"" of John Carpenter's literal sci-fi chiller, refusing the claims that ""it isn't that bad."" Lo and behold, I was clearly being a bit pretentious by not giving it a try as it's one of the most effective horrors of recent times, even if it isn't completely original! My fears were few, but it mattered to me that there's a huge difference between prosthetic effects and CGI, especially in movies that aren't considered high budget blockbusters, and it mattered to me that the difference in filmmaking styles were going to have a noticeable effect on the credibility of the classic.So to the purists that knocked it, and those that haven't tried it at all, I have to say that despite some big risks, this prequel/reboot/preboot mostly works well for me, and I'm hard to please. However I will explain what worked and what bugged me.It takes place at the Norwegian base featured in the early scenes of the John Carpenter original. Scientists Kate (Winstead) and Adam (Olsen) join Dr Sander Halvorson on an expedition to Antarctica where the UFO has been discovered under the ice. While introducing us to a cast of rather salty characters, events quickly go from foreboding, to creepy, to crazy when the Thing is released from the ice shortly after preliminary scientific tests.It wastes no time in wreaking havoc, but what I found interesting and very enjoyable, in a freakishly horrible way, was how the creative team put characters and audience within jaw-snapping proximity of the monster(s) so suddenly, and bloody hell, the creature effects in this movie are actually top notch. Every monstrous encounter does Rob Bottin proud.In Carpenter's version, what you didn't see bore the very effective power of suggestion. Also what you did see scared your pants off. This version stays faithful where it matters, but goes to greater lengths to freak you out while finding a new angle to keep it as original and effective as it can be.There's still that paranoid suspense when we see how characters act around each other, but sometimes you just know who to trust. It's more a head-on collision of freakish horrors as helpless victims succumb to their own wild terror in the presence of the Thing. There is a lot of acting talent put to great use on your goosebumps and you really feel for some people despite not really knowing them. Joel Edgerton and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are safe bets as actors you can count on, but the Norwegian team do a terrific job all round.Onto the flaws of the movie, there are some dead ends I didn't appreciate as barely noticeable as they may seem. Dr Halvorson was a great character for messing with peoples' minds. I really did see him being the equivalent of Wilford Brimley's Dr Blair, but with more conviction. I felt that the culmination of events for certain characters such as his was a bit of a copout. He and others deserved better/worse.Also there are scenes throughout the film where the Thing could easily have struck and finished off the survivors with little effort. It didn't, and that corrupted its agenda. There are characters here that are simply forgotten and then just show up later with no explanation. There are also characters I didn't believe were infected, because there was no way they could have been.The Thing (2011) also goes so far as to incorporate something new into its story, being like Prometheus and coming across as more modern or futuristic than its daddy. In the original, they did tests with blood and heat. In this one, they have different sorts of tests, which doesn't quite work out. Personally, neither am I a fan of fully functioning 10,000 year old spaceships that look more advanced than their pilots. When you bring in new-age technology, you're screwing with the mythology, not building on it. Finally, I wasn't a fan of the pre-credits finale. It simply didn't convey well.Maybe I just haven't processed it all yet, but that ending just seemed like one last cheap thrill to put the cherry on top or something that failed to be more than meets the eye. It deserved a darker ending than the John Carpenter version and fell slightly short for me but then the mid-credits scenes tied up the film nicely to the events kickstarting the original Carpenter version and that was a great treat from the filmmakers.In all, though, this greatly exceeded my expectations and I'm glad I gave it a watch. Dare I say that the soundtrack was ten times more suspenseful and chilling than Ennio Morricone's version?",The Thing

Here the Thing is showed always and, beyond the interesting computer graphic, there's also the idea of making an action movie, an home invasion Alien-like horror. One thing that I appreciated was the fact to reuse the original title, as something that counts the impossibility of naming the monster.

The movie makers made a HUGE mistake in calling it 'The Thing' which led everyone to believe it was a remake of John Carpenter's 1982 movie. It's NOT. It's a prequel and it would work very well as a 'The Thing' binge showing the movies in tandem. The plot differs enough from Carpenter's that it could've been called any numbers of 'things' and had it's own identity. I'm sure executives were involved in the naming because they can't seem to get enough of shoving remakes down our throats even though audiences have had to endure more than enough of them. This movie had my attention from start to finish and it's one of the stronger horror outings of the new millennium. The acting is all very good and the film captures the air of total paranoia and mistrust. Mary Kate Winstead did a standout job. The creature effects and blended CGI works more often than it doesn't. The movie is also well directed, doesn't rely on many jump scares and keeps you engaged and wondering what's going on and how it will all play out.

Gore, weapons, and surprises galore will satisfy fans of the genre along with a storyline that never drags or confuses. Although, ultimately this lacks everything that made the 1982 mega-hit such a remarkable film, especially the gloomy atmosphere and tense undercurrent. Not to mention the attention to detail and work that went into the monster effects of the 1980's could never be offset by today's computer graphics and lack of originality.

173,ksj870,A Fine Prequel That Stands Alone,8,9 July 2012,"As a renowned paleontologist, Kate Lloyd is used to digging things up from the earth, things that once breathed and walked but now are entombed in ice and rock. So when a Norwegian research station in Antarctica asks Kate to come out and help them excavate something they've found, she finds their reluctance to talk about their discovery merely eccentric. Only when she sees the thing with her own eyes does she realize the magnitude of what she is about to help unleash on an unsuspecting world, something that has hibernated for thousands of years within the icy Antarctic ground, waiting to be reborn.Of course, The Thing 2011 is not the first movie of that moniker. The first was the semi-classic from the 1950s, starring James Arness as the title monster, followed in 1982 by John Carpenter's big-budget remake, widely (and rightly) considered a classic in its own right. The new version is actually a prequel to the Carpenter film, but don't worry about it if you haven't seen that movie. Only a few scenes actually serve as direct ties between the two films, and in most respects our current movie can be watched as more of a remake than as one of a set.As a stand-alone film, 2011's movie is actually quite good. The Antarctic setting is the perfect environment for carefully constructed horror, and the isolation of our protagonists serves to create a claustrophobic, white-out nightmare in which it is surprisingly easy to believe evil could intrude without warning. Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr manipulates setting and image to great effect, and is smart enough to realize that monsters are often scarier when they are seen less, not more. The special effects are brilliant, however, and when the title creature does reveal itself it is truly a magnificent abomination. There is a lot of blood, so squeamish viewers take note, but the physical horrors are dwarfed by the psychological ones—paranoia indeed runs deep throughout The Thing.The cast is largely unknown, except for up-and-coming starlet Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Kate and veteran character actor Ulrich Thomsen, the leader of the scientific station who invites Kate to help out with his team's unearthly discovery. Winstead is great as the heroine, competent but vulnerable, resolved when necessary but still scared out of her mind by the terror she is confronted with. Winstead is the heart and soul of the picture, but she gets a lot of support. Thomsen is always reliable, and the rest of the cast makes up for in solid performance what they lack in name recognition. The script is well-wrought andwhile a remake (pardon, prequel) can only be so original, the plot does take some interesting twists that should keep viewers on their toes and give them quite a few shocks.The Thing is a welcome addition to the science fiction canon. Exciting, intelligent, and scary as well, this is one remake—or prequel—that lives up to its source material.",The Thing

What do you really get from a remake??? Nearlly all of them make people rather watch the original over again.The Thing technically is not a remake. It is a superfluous prequel rooted to the 1982 John Carpenter film which is, yes technically a remake but is closer to the original short story than the Howard Hawks' movie from the 50's. The Hawks film was a traditional 50's monster story. The Carpenter film, being more like the short story which is a psychological thriller/horror film because it plays up the paranoia in the story since the alien can change form to replicate anything living.This prequel is basically the same thing as the Carpenter movie but with pathetic CGI effects replacing the brilliant work done by Rick Baker which is really what made the Carpenter film so classic.CGI to me is nothing more than cartoons. Simple as that. If it is done poorly like here, then it's like we are supposed to be scared of Roger Rabbit.I hate the joke Hollywood has become. This movie is one small example of that. See also Death Wish, Ghostbusters, The Fog, Poltergeist for other lame attempts to cash in again on past success. TV is where chances are being taken in terms of entertainment, but the movie industry is just a bloated, overly expensive place where sad rehashed ideas of things gone by are regurgitated with abymsal results.",The Thing
175,rebecca-ry,Not a remake.....apparently,6,26 August 2012,"'The Thing' is advertised and written as a prequel to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' made in 1982. It's a good idea; to give everyone a little explanation about what exactly did happen before MacReady and his crew showed up.It's a shame it didn't work. It's plot consists of the exact same points included in John Carpenter's film. It is NOT a remake but it may as well have been, there was no new concept introduced to show that any of the script writers had given it any real thought whatsoever.The dialogue was pretty basic, nothing special. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character was written to be a sort of modern Ellen Ripley but she couldn't pull it off despite her efforts. The other characters aren't given enough screen time for you to really care what happens but you could argue that that was the case in Carpenter's film too.The CGI was impressive but compared to the 1982 film it wasn't as real and gritty; the lack of CGI in that film meant all of the disgusting things you saw were really made. Today it is a lot easier to make the thing with CGI but it doesn't give off the same quality that its predecessor did.The ending was a little bit clever but because the beginning of the 1982 film made it really easy to build a back story around you cannot really credit anyone for that. Overall, the film is good but if you have already seen 'The Thing' (1982) then you will not be shocked, surprised or phased by this film at all. It just leaves you feeling a bit empty.",The Thing
176,drew_atreides,A Solid Creature-Feature,7,14 October 2011,"...just got back from THE THING 2011...Have to admit first off I am a John Carpenter fan. Over the years i've gone back and forth on which of the man's films i think are his best, but the 1982 THE THING is always in the discussion. It is a true horror classic.I went into this prequel doing my best to taper expectations. I knew it could never live up to the first film. What could? What I got was a fairly solid monster movie. There are some genuine moments of tension and suspense, and if you're in it for special fx and monster design, there's some pretty cool stuff here. The overriding sense of paranoia in the first film is replaced with more standard ""ALIEN"" type fair, but it is well-executed.The film is at it's best when it's carving it's own path and doing it's own thing. Where it falters is where it's forced to ""set up"" for or ""pay tribute to"" the first film. That stuff comes across as pretty ham- fisted and actually works against the movie overall.Still, the overall experience was decent. I was never bored, and actually pretty involved for most of the film.If you're a fan of the original, or just looking for a Saturday Night Shocker, you could definitely do worse.",The Thing

178,ukproject,"A shape-shifting, gory, senseless creation that deserves to be blow torched to oblivion...",4,7 April 2013,".... and that's the movie I'm talking about, not the creature. It's supposedly a prequel, yet has so many similar scenarios with the original and inconsistencies in it's storyline as a prequel that it sometimes feels like a remake.The creature itself is an even bigger mess. Keeping in mind that this creature survives through to the first movie, the actual nature of the creature changes. It's supposed to be a technologically advanced being that has absorbed and assimilated beings from all over the galaxy that behaves intelligently in waiting for the right moment to strike, and now chases victims down corridors ala mindless slasher flick style.I would rather this movie had been made in Norwegian with English subtitles than see a bunch of English speaking Brits and Americans forced into the mix. I mean really? A national expedition that requires secrecy and the Nords invite an American to one of the most important finds ever? Are the Norwegians devoid of a paleontologist? And a lab rat American paleontologist takes control of the situation while a bunch of rugged Nordic men used to working in harsh conditions panic like cats in a dog pound and are unable to come up with a single coherent thought. Many others have written in detail why this movie is just about worth watching once and I won't repeating them. I'll just say this; If you made the mistake that I made of buying the Blu Ray version then having watched it you will end up wanting to take it outside and taking a flame thrower to it.",The Thing
179,WasiReviews,Unfortunately Forgettable,6,12 November 2021,"The Thing 2011 was an attempt at making something great, something that could carry the legacy of the 1982 classic. Which among my favorite films of all time and one of the most iconic horror films of all time. This being the case my expectations were through the roof but unfortunately, it did not live up to the original but it still wasn't too bad either. If the movie had fewer flamethrower scenes and more new, fresh scenes instead of CGI and carbon copy cookie cutter scenes from the original. I feel like we could have had a classic film from 2011 but unfortunately, we just received something forgettable and underwhelming. With tropes, we've seen at least a couple of hundred times in every horror film the alien spacecraft looked like a complete ripoff of Alien (1979) which doesn't help the movie's case. Overall I forgot about the film just a few days after watching it and because it didn't stick with me I can't give it anything higher than a six out of ten. The acting wasn't bad and I felt Mary Elizabeth Wienstead did a great job as the main herione. The reason the score is that high is for the snowy setting and sensible story that leads into the original pretty well. Despite leading well into the original we didn't really need it... did we? A full reboot could've brought a more interesting flavor.",The Thing
180,jacklmauro,"Close, No Alien Cigar",5,12 January 2019,"I wanted to dislike this, mainly because I thought I was about to see Carpenter's film. But I watched and I'm not entirely sorry I did. I give much credit for a solid performance by the lead actress; she does NOT overplay and that's critical. I also applaud the clever spin on the 'find out who's human' test, and some solid suspense along the way. What really hurts the movie has been discussed here. Namely, you know and care nothing about the many characters, to the dangerous point of losing track of how many remain at various points. Nothing could be deadlier for such a film. I would add that, also mentioned here, it's very odd that the alien, whose entire survival relies on replicating hosts, keeps revealing itself when not in danger. It's a shame - a tighter script with logic and minimal character development, and we could've had something here.",The Thing
181,Amthermandes,"Amazing and fun movie, if you're not too picky",7,14 October 2011,"I'm excited to say I'm not disappointed with this movie, but I'm also not incredibly impressed.First, the cons:Not nearly as much character development this time around. Also, the CGI, while still fun, was overused. It seemed too ""fast"". There were a couple small holes in the movie, and the sound wasn't as good as it could've been. Something that bugged me, were the sound effects when they were looking through the microscope. You're not supposed to hear microorganisms making noises. There was too much soundtrack in the movie as well. But the BIGGEST issue for me, was that it wasn't really that scary. On a scare level, it was about a 4. I think this was partially due to the fact there was too much soundtrack, and the movie felt more like ""Deep Rising"" than ""The Thing"". Also, some of the deaths seemed a little disappointing, like it could've been more. The movie was missing the element of surprise, fear and paranoia. To sum up the cons: Not scary enough, too much CGI, ending could've been better. The PROS:Entertaining and well executed. There was enough Norwegian and other elements to tie this movie in well with the 1982 movie. The very ending during the credits were great. The creature effects, even though slightly overused, were fun, exhilarating, and impressive. I loved the use of actors in the film, they all did really well. It was very intense sometimes, and well put together. While some deaths were lamer than anticipated, others were spot on. The creatures were really awesome, and it was a killer movie. ALl in all, if you get really picky, it's not as good of a movie as it could've and SHOULD'VE been. BUT, even though I'm an avid film of John Carpenters's version, I can't rail on this movie, because it's its own movie. It did well paying tribute to Carpenter's version, and it did well making a name for it's own. I was very happy with it.",The Thing
182,StonedMagician,Bad: 3.0,3,27 July 2019,"Has anyone involved with the making of this film seen Alien? What I saw in the theater made me think they did. And completely missed the point. That film is the standard for sci-fi horror, but for the exact opposite reason that this film thinks. In The Thing from Another World (the 1951 original), the thing in question was almost never really seen (in one shot, it appeared to be somewhat humanoid). This what made it scary: your imagination can create things more horrific than makeup ever can. The 1982 version, by legendary horror director John Carpenter, showed it a bit more, but still not enough to ever get a complete picture, leaving your imagination to do some of the work. This film does neither. It instead shows you everything about the creature, and it is not pleasant. And that is not meant as in ""it's grotesque"" (although it is). It is unpleasant because the special effects are so obvious, it instantly reminds you that you're watching a movie, and not experiencing it. It has a tremendous number of appendages, many of which seem to be teeth or tentacles meant to pull things into said teeth. Which begs the question: how exactly did it manage to build the huge ship that it crashed to earth in? The idea of the movie is actually one that will be able to be told over and over given the right people making it. The constant paranoia of wondering who the one who is not human is is as close to a timeless premise as horror movies come. It is also obviously lacking in this movie. It always throws characters off on their own in a way that makes it so you know who will die and when, ruining any minute-to-minute suspense there might have been. Other than the horror of the imagination, this the one other source of fear the film could have mined. As it stands, rather than being scary, or even thrilling, it is simply boring. Not even the scenes where characters are killed off are any fun to watch. The film is all but an exercise in tedium, which is exactly the opposite of what a horror movie should be. Going back to my Alien bit from a few paragraphs ago, in some ways, it is clear that people on this film did see it. They thought that people came for the strong female heroine (portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), or the bloody death scenes (check), or perhaps the grotesque creature design (Alien's monster seems to have had far more work put into it). All of these are wrong. The suspense is what made that film a classic, and its lack is what makes this version of The Thing the exact opposite. The ending, however, is one of the movies very few strong points. It turned what I had thought the movie was completely on its head in a way I didn't anticipate. Other than that, though, this is a horror film that will appeal only to gore hounds. This is not a film to go see on Halloween night. Unless you prefer to sleep through yours.",The Thing
183,GTeixeira,A remake cleverly disguised as a prequel,7,25 June 2014,"What happens when you take John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing', add a female lead, reduce the gore-like quality of the special effects (while adding some CGI as well) and an ending aimed towards connecting with Carpenter's beginning?You get 2011's 'The Thing', the remake-like prequel to an horror classic.The producers claimed they didn't want a remake, couldn't make a remake, but a remake was what they did. The start of Carpenter's version gave a margin for a prequel, and indicated something similar to the story had happened before; so, the excuse for a prequel-disguised remake was there, truth be told.But it is just too similar, too 'been there, done that'. The tough-looking cast of Antarctica explorers is there (but rather than led by Kurt Russell and Keith David, we have a very good Joel Edgerton stand out in a good cast). The only difference is they went the 'Alien' route and included a female lead (who is both smarter and more competent than the rest), a very good Mary Elizabeth Winstead.The effects are good, but appallingly inferior to the 1982 version. Whereas Carpenter's version was a masterful usage of make-up and practical effects, today's films have the bad tendency of relying on CGI. It feels cheated, especially since they never achieve the level of unnerving bodily horror Carpenter did, and even feel too fake at times.Another problem is that 2011's 'The Thing' is a step down on the thriller aspect. While it flirts with the more twisty parts of the plot, it lacks the extreme level of paranoia and the thrilling atmosphere the former version created. It actually feels rushed at moments, and too action-like to make use of the more interesting moments of the story.All in all, while it feels too similar and inferior to Carpenter's version, 2011's 'The Thing' is still entertaining enough to work. 1982's 'The Thing' is one of horror's best, and one of my favorite's as well, and even a toned down version of it is still a welcome watch. I would give it a 6.5. Since I can't, I round it upwards for a nice 7.",The Thing

187,VikiLauda,Here's another Thing....,8,21 April 2021,"First off I must say I am not ""fan"" of the John Carpenter version (but I do love the film!) I AM a fan of the ""Thing"" story from the original short story ""Who Goes There"" from 1938 which I read when I was just 12 years old after seeing ""Thing from another world"" 1951 (on tv in 1977) I just adore the story! & because of this I can see what the makers of this film were aiming at with this, quite frankly superbly done prequal. The makers here clearly show a huge respect & love of the Thing story (novella) the 1951 movie & John Carpenters version as they demonstrate all the best aspects of the three very different stories very clearly. I have even watched this before watching the Carpenter version & the stories fit together beautifully.Set in 1982 an alien spacefraft is discovered in antartica & a young paleontologist Dr Kate Loyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited to help investigate. They find a creature in the ice & cut it out in a huge block & take it back to the Norwegian base. In the evening while the crew are celebrating their alien discovery, the alien bursts out of its ice tomb & all hell breaks loose...I really enjoyed this but I do have some criticisms. Like the Carpenter version the character development suffers & the 1982 setting really does not work because the hair & clothes fashion is very 2010's. John Carpenter kept the costumes very low key in his version because he wanted the special effects to fly, so the makers may have just gone with this idea, but in the 21st century it looks like it was filmed last week & not 35 years ago. Also I am no fan of excessive CGI. The thing (pardon the pun!) that made the Carpenter version so chilling were the very real puppeteered monsters created by some of the most fantastic monster makers ever (Winston & Bottin) but I feel that CGI monsters just don't have the same effect. However there are other reasons I enjoy this one such as a very imaginative script & screeplay (I really tip my hat to the writer Eric Heisserer on this!) some fairly decent acting & solid pacing, but most of all the makers really do show their love of the Thing story & this movie is a salute & a tribute to all the previous films. When this prequal idea was first pitched to Universal the producers said they did not want to do a remake as it would be like ""Painting a moustashe on the Mona Lisa"" which I must agree with.Finally in the future I would like to see some really talented moster makers using a combination of puppeteered, CGI & animatronic monsters for future films. Monsters only work when they are creative & aritistic as this is what made the Carpenter film glitter. Fans of that version should try & watch this before watching the 1982 version, as I did, for the real prequel expierence. You have to watch the end credits BTW. I will rate this as a 16+ for CGI gore but there is no bad language & no sex or nudity (except monster CGI nudity) so be prepared for a fast paced ""Thing"" ride for the next generation, & a massive will done to all the cast & crew. Thank you x.",The Thing
188,J-bot6,An effective prequel,7,17 July 2014,"This movie is a prequel and not a remake.Quite a few people have written negative reviews of this film.However, after finally getting around to watching this movie, I feel that the filmmakers did a very good job of creating an entertaining prequel that respects the 1982 John Carpenter masterpiece.Great attention to detail is put into replicating sets from the 1982 film and the level of continuity between the two films is truly remarkable. Many of the creature effects are created using practicals and I'm glad to see it. I'm especially impressed with the first major human-alien fusion reveal showing the partly-regenerated human during the autopsy scene. Nicely done.Also of note is the female lead and the Norwegian actors. Kudos.Finally, I really enjoyed the fact that they spent the time and money to show the interior of the ship (something that I've been waiting a long time to see and I'm sure it's something the 1982 filmmakers wished they had the budget to explore).Where I will agree with many reviewers is that the 1982 film is the better of the two movies. Regardless, this new film deserves credit and -- believe me -- it could have been worse.All-in-all, this is a film worth watching.",The Thing
189,Legendary_Badass,Horror isn't as fresh on the second helping,6,14 October 2011,"The Thing (2011) takes place just before the events of The Thing (2011). To antagonize confusion, Universal decided to stick with the same title—verbatim. So kind of them.It's 1982. While conducting lab research on prehistoric remains, and listening to the delightful tunes of Men at Work, Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited into joining a research team in Antarctica that has unearthed a frozen creature not of this world. Before she can consult her loved ones, Kate is whisked across the globe. The expedition is anything but routine when the creature awakens from slumber and begins to hunt the crew.The characters serve their purpose in that they are here to die. Again, today's filmmakers get it wrong. Characters need multiple facets in order for the audience to react. It's important for each character to have a history, motive, and/or personality. These are traits that humans carry with them and shape their being. When an underdeveloped character faces peril, no one cares. Conversely, Kurt Russell's MacReady of The Thing (1982) poured a drink into a computer after it beat him at chess. This act of aggression shows and attitude that is missing from the protagonists of this new version.Billed as a prequel, The Thing (2011) goes through many of the same scenes, in the same environment, with the same type of people. It might as well be a remake, which is what the title suggests. The biggest difference in plot is in getting to briefly explore the creature's spaceship. The visual effects are now a computer equation. Gone are the need for complex puppets and molds (though unless I'm mistaken there are a few seen here). Horrific transformations as the creature fuses with victims are now a render away. All the visuals are serviceable and some as convincing as one would want to see, but to me the closest door to reality involves application of actual objects. Sure the razor-toothed mouth moves more realistically, but the teeth are more telling than dentures.I've never seen a movie make less use out of its exotic locale. Though there is casual talk of it, no one actually gets cold. Heck, Lars even sits on top of the excavated creature as it's driven toward the research facility. Of course this is better dealt with in the '82 film of the same name, so there isn't a lot of point in watching an inferior retelling. That '82 film was in of itself a remake, but radically different than The Thing from Another World (1951), with far more graphic violence and fresh creature design.

The story is good and links up almost perfectly with Carpenter's remake, the actors are good, the locations and sets are good, there just seems to be that bit of directing that is missing the visceral energy of the 1982 film. It's like a can of pop that has lost its fizz.
I do like that it is not the average music-video hack directing job with the usual rapid fire editing that leaves you in a roadrunner swirl of dust not knowing which way you are facing and with being on the verge of a seizure. It has a great pace but when it needs the quick editing to make the action scenes emotionally stimulating, it does not deliver as it should.

195,fritzlang,Great fun!!! Ingore naysayers.,8,21 October 2011,"Just got back from seeing this in the theater.WHAT A BLAST!From all the mediocre to poor reviews, I wasn't expecting much..But this film scared the crap out of me!I jumped 4 or 5 times out of my chair. Tore my napkin to shreds and actually screamed once! Not too many films can have that affect on me!What I liked.. 1) The female lead. Not only was she a great actress, but she didn't play the stereotypical tough-as-nails woman (a la sigourney weaver, linda hamilton, etc.). She was scared. Her character was well thought out and the character interplay between her and the other men was very interesting.2) the American vs norwegian undertones was a nice twist. Added another layer that kept this from being a generic thriller.3) The spaceship was awesome! This was actually one of the few aspects of the movie that I thought was better than the other version.4) the movie MOVED. I was never bored.5) The scenes with the monster were very effective and, as I said, had me jumping out of the seat!! Great special effects!6) I liked how they changed how they could tell if someone was still human or not. Another nice twist.7) There were some nice little-humorous moments sprinkled throughout the film. Nothing that would make you laugh out loud, but just some nice smirks and smiles that helped break up the tension.8) I liked how they used Carpenter's music as they transitioned to the beginning of his film at the end.What could have been better.1) the music. It wasn't bad, but I didn't feel it really added to the film either. Strangely enough, I found the music over the end credits to be better than the rest of the film!2) While the female lead was very strong, I found most of the male characters to be pretty non-descript. That really took away from both the inter-personnel dynamics and caring about these people when they died. Some were stronger than others, but as a group I thought they were pretty interchangeable.3)It could have been more honest and just have been a straight remake, instead of posing as a prequel. It really was a remake, with a 2 minute ending that made it seem like it was a prequel. Beside that, it really was the same story as Carpenter's version. The other option would have to have a completely original back story. It is unfortunate that the producers chose none of these options.3) It could have been based on an original story. I really think being a remake/quasi-prequel is going to hurt this film. Taken on its own, I found it to be a very effective creature-feature/sci-fi film. But with the name and the story being the same as Carpenter's classic, it is going to be hard to find a large audience for this. Perhaps people who never saw the original will be more open to enjoying this film, but they may eventually be curious about the original, seek it out, and the comparison will taint their previously positive view of the film.Just forget about the original.. leave all comparisons outside the theater, and enjoy this film for what it is.

For fans of the original, i have to say, this one does not beat it (obviously), but it sure as hell comes to a near-tie with it! The Thing sets up the prequel in the same time-frame; 1982, where a Norwegian team of scientists waits for the arriving newcomers that include 4 Americans (Winstead, Edgerton, Olsen, and Akinnuoye-Agbaje), two of them being the pilots. The other two Americans are Kate Lloyd and Adam Goodman. At first thought, you may think Kate is going to be the Ripley of the film (Alien reference) but in point-of-fact she is not; there are no B.A moments with her. The character development is well done since not much is needed to be told as their personalities give away the kind of people they are. The setting is basically perfect; an isolated feel takes over the film as the team is together at Antarctica, and the discovery of the alien craft makes things even more 'tight'. The CGI, on the other hand, could have been better; there are points where it's fantastic, like the first Thing 'encounter', the first assimilation, and the ship (especially the ship). But the second time the Thing 'shifts' its form, it looks a bit cheesy with the CGI. Something practical effects could have done better.Other than that, The Thing is a worthy prequel that keeps the same tone and fear of the first film and makes up for the loss of what the first film left out; the mystery of the alien ship. I'm not saying that's bad though, just saying it's better that this film covered it. The first film will always be a classic, and this will be what comes before; a hit.8.5/10 Stars***",The Thing

200,cyberknight,How to end a story...,9,16 January 2021,"Usually, people have an idea of how to start a story, but no clue of how to end it. On this film, it's exactly the opposite, they knew exactly how to end it, but no idea how to start it.Major spoiler! Stop reading if you have any intention of ever watch it! Hint, it's worth at least one watch, because if you like it, it'll be a great fun to rewatch any time, and if you don't, you'll still have the John Carpenter's film to go back to.John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" was not exactly a remake of the 1951's ""The Thing from Another World"". The story starts a little after the alien is recovered from the ice. In the 1951's film, the alien is found, thawed and, eventually, killed, so no sequel should be possible. John Carpenter took the original idea and expanded it, by telling a story of what would have happened if the alien hadn't been killed, but escaped the camp.This film is a prequel to the 1982's one, ending exactly where Carpenter's film starts! The whole film plays like a condensed version of ""The Thing from Another World"" (1951) and ""The Thing"" (1982), but when the end comes, it's shown that it's actually a remake of the 1951's film, replacing its lame monster by the absolutely more terrifying Carpenter's version.The 1982's film didn't perfectly match the 1951's plot, because on the earlier film, the alien was different, and it was killed for good. This prequel fills that hole, by telling the story of how the alien is found and how it escapes to terrorise people on the 1982's film.The characters are interesting and a new plot device is inserted, giving the story a fast pace and never letting it get dull. Mistakes made by the characters are resolved immediately, so no artificial tension is sustained (it's actually an exciting game to guess what's going to happen in the next scene, after a new information is presented!)Although one of the characters is smarter than the rest, just like in Carpenter's film, the script doesn't hold itself by making the others dumb. Instead, they are more emotional, and less rational, making the story a lot more believable and, at least to me, likeable.Talking about the story, some people may not find it ""original enough"". Personally, I found the new plot device a very good idea, adding a lot of possibilities to future stories.Regarding the special and visual effects, they are not as effective as the 1982's purely practical effects, but the story is too good to be ruined just by looks.All is all, I think this film replaces the 1951's one very aptly. Before this, people had to endure the dull 1951's film if they wanted to get a background story for the magnificent John Carpenter's film. Now, there is a much better alternative!",The Thing
201,asphyxion_,Supremely disappointing; you'll leave feeling cheated once the credits roll.,4,16 January 2020,"Not a prequel. Not a sequel. Just an extremely bad, near shot-for-shot remake of Carpenter's penultimate, mainstream masterpiece (his ultimate masterpiece being the lesser-known cult classic 'Prince of Darkness,' IMO).What made the original Thing so effective was the bone-chilling practical effects and their precision marriage to animatronic + stop-motion techniques. The original's ability to bring real brick-and-mortar makeup effects to the screen with zero help from computers, and have them look incredibly real, is what makes the original Thing such an exquisite piece of science-fiction horror (ala Scott's 'Alien').With this self-proclaimed sequel, we are inundated with smarmy CGI pablum and gross repetition of visuals. In the original Thing, we see different degrees of the alien's shapeshifting abilities. In this sorry excuse for a prequel, we're constantly forced to endure the same multi-limbed fleshy mass with none of the shapeshifting terror that allowed the tension in the original to feel so palpable. What we're ultimately left with is a bunch of not-so-pretty visuals that do absolutely nothing to build any tension, because once you see Thing for the first time in this movie, you've essentially seen Thing for the last time in this movie.It's nothing like the original, where we're left to fearfully wonder just who or what could possibly be the Thing after one form of it is killed. Where the original had indelible sequences like the dog's head splitting open and revealing an extraterrestrial maw with hellish tentacle-appendages, we instead are repetitiously forcefed some half-man-half-melted-candle hybrid that squeals like the alien during the Area 51 autopsy scene from ID4 Independence Day.The only thing this 'prequel' has going for it are the familiar faces bringing in some solid lead and supporting roles as the destitute survivors trying to live to see another day. There's also more time spent on the part of the movie where the group is trying to figure out who is the Thing and how they can test everyone to make sure. There's a lot more duplicity in the narrative than the original film, and it's about the only point in the film that we see any halfway decent character development. We also get to explore Thing's vessel submerged in the permafrost and are given some clues as to its extraterrestrial origins and technology which leads to a man-vs-beast confrontation with Thing. These two parts of the movie are about the only things that really set it apart from Carpenter's original because everything else is either a shot-for-shot reproduction of the Carpenter film or it's a very poor CGI replication of what the first movie did so exquisitely with practical effects.As stated in so many reviews before mine, there's just nothing scary, bleak, or pulse-pounding about this unnecessary cash-grab of a remake when comparing it to the original. It will ultimately leave you feeling cheated if you're a fan of the original, but if you're new to Thing and haven't seen Carpenter's film than you may enjoy this. It's about 96 minutes long minus credits so the upside is, you won't waste much time watching it regardless if you end up liking it or not.Do yourself a favor and watch the original instead, and then after you finish the original Thing, watch the rest of Carpenter's Trilogy (1. The Thing, 2. Prince of Darkness, 3. Mouth of Madness) for one of the most unsettling experiences the horror genre has to offer us.",The Thing
202,rupert-ian,Way underrated,8,3 February 2018,"The hate this movie gets is ridiculous in my opinion. I've been a fan of the Carpenter's The Thing since I was a little kid. It is one of the best sci-fi/horror movies of all time, in my opinion. The story, characters, setting, effects, sound, music, acting...all great. It stands next to Alien as the best of the sci-fi horror genre. I think this movie did it justice and gave me something I always wanted ever since seeing the original: a movie of the Norwegian camp's story. This movie did exactly that. The CGI did bother me, but it seems that they did some tweaks for the Blu-Ray release and it looks much better. The CGI scenes looked too shiny before, very obvious. I just watched the Blu-Ray for the first time and it looks worlds better. The film grain, extra detail, color, and lack of DNR helped a lot. There were only a couple scenes that stood out, whereas before most of the CGI slapped you in the face and stood out like a sore thumb. It is sad how the studio messed with this movie. If they hadn't stepped in and shined over the practical effects with so much CGI, and if they hadn't added the ""boss fight"" at the end, this movie would be even better. Especially the end.... The original ending sounded awesome and would have actually explained some of the origins of the creature such as ""why was it on that ship"" ""why did it leave the ship"" ""was it flying the ship?"" etc. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job in this movie and all the acting was good. The original is a 10/10 for me. One of the most perfect movies in my book. This movie gets an 8 for the Blu-Ray. Before seeing the Blu-Ray, the special effects bothered me so much I would have rated it as a 7.",The Thing

205,mistabobdobolina,"Not a match for the original, but better (and smarter) than the haters will admit",7,23 April 2012,"As many reviewers have already said, the attention to detail and continuity in this prequel to the 1982 classic (in many opinions the best horror movie of all time) is truly impressive. Some have lamented the fact that it fills in details in the mythos they would prefer to have left imagined, but I can't fault it for that; those who didn't want to know the story of the first film's Norwegian base should simply have stayed away. As an attempt at rendering that story, the 2011 prequel is perfectly credible, and the callouts to the first film's various allusions to this story are almost flawless, including (of course) the closing credit sequence.Of course it can't hope to match the atmosphere of the classic. For one thing, in contrast to the relatively tiny American research outpost where the first film happens, the bigger and better-appointed Norwegian base involves a larger cast of characters about whom we know much less by the time the action gets started. For another, CGI effects still don't have the sense of mass and solidity needed to put them in a class with really well-done stop-motion and animatronic effects. The size of the cast can't really be helped: the Norwegian base needs to be big enough and well-staffed enough to have believably excavated the massive UFO we see both in the first film and here. The CGI effects are a bit more regrettable, but not bad enough to actually ruin the movie.Some complain that the prequel's version of the creature doesn't seem as wily and calculated as the original monster. Here's one area where I'm willing to defend the newer film: it is in fact logical that the creature would be in less than top form right after waking from a 100,000-year hibernation. The creature we see here *should* be different from the subtler monster of Carpenter's film, and that it comes off as clumsier here -- prone to revealing itself prematurely or in seemingly panicky reaction to events around it -- is in fact the creative choice that makes the *most* sense in context of the story. (And the monster gets wilier as it goes, as careful attention to Carter's character arc shows.) And while the Thing's appearances can never quite replicate the gut-wrenching suspense of the original, they're still satisfyingly shocking and scary, and -- this aspect is an improvement -- the horror experienced by its victims as they're assimilated is brought out very hauntingly in ways that wouldn't have been possible for Carpenter's original... particularly in the scene where we witness the creation of the famous two-headed monstrosity.Another point in favour of the prequel: it actually has something new to bring to the table in terms of information about the monster that McCready & co. never happen across. The best (and hardest-to-produce) kind of prequel is the kind that casts old stories in a fresh perspective without breaking continuity. It's nice to see this done well.Though most of the cast is offed too quickly for us to get to know them, and the latter ""monster-hunt"" sequence gets too action-y for many tastes, the film is still strong and the principals all put in great work (I particularly liked Lars, and think Mary Elizabeth Winstead isn't getting enough credit for her work as Kate -- the most bizarre complaint I've seen on IMDb is the one that laments the lack of an all-male cast). It doesn't match the classic, but it's a worthy effort and a film worth seeing nevertheless.",The Thing
206,aminjacoub,An insult to loyal fans,6,27 November 2011,"I was 15 when Carpenter's ""The Thing"" came out, and when I saw it first time in the theater I was 17. I remember it as probably the scariest and fascinating Sci-Fi suspense horror movie I ever saw in life.What to say? Critics did not like it; audience mostly did not like it too. As Carpenter himself gave some short statement lately how movie lacks expectations. But what follows next is that movie becomes cult classic. The new release is a witness to that.I remember that everyone who I know who can't stand blood and real chill, avoided to watch it. Some of them however that could not take gore, but appreciate good story and suspense admitted its greatness, even with stomach issues.And as an important issue is that of unique special effects fiesta from wizard Rob Bottin. He really showed us unique magic with such realistic aspect.The camera work, music score and the cast is all unforgettable and masterful.In his movie Carpenter spontaneously developed his characters very deeply. Kurt Russell greatly express authoritative and charismatic leader character, and all the others conceivable without marginality indeed.And now we have this. What should I call it...? I heard last year that there will be a remake of The Thing, and I thought the worst of it as I am aware how Hollywood stand on remakes, especially with something delicate like Carpenter's movie.Lately I found that it will be a prequel to Carpenter's film, so I become somehow excited. Would there be some answers to how it all started, and how that Norwegians ended.I watched it last night, and in the middle of movie I practically were sweat of strong nausea and nervousness. The feeling that were sense of something as a blunt to what I remember Carpenter did. I know that directors intentions were not that, but it just create that impression. The only part of this movie that had sense to me, and looked better than whole that crap, were the sequences during the ending credits. The very end of the movie along with the music score and visually identical looking credits merged with the very beginning of the Carpenter's movie. For this I would say ""Bravo""!But if that was the best, what we can conclude then? I will not comment that same two half face creature that we remember they found at the beginning of Carpenter movie, as with all arsenal of CGI possibilities it was made nothing more than a bad copy of Bottin's Art.My opinion is that this movie looks more like copy of the Carpenter's film. Maybe as a prequel it is suppose to be like that (I did not read the novel), but I already knew what will be the next scene, almost every time, with small differences. But how come Carpenter lay on the same novel, and were impressed by Hawks movie, yet made an original?Movie script feels marginal and non inventive, cast are strong, but in this movie flimsy, and combination of Norwegian and English were lousy. That mixture that Norvegian crew used during the plot, falls apart. The two Norwegians who speaks both languages here, and starting to chase that dog at the end, in Carpenter's movie speaks Norvegian only. So why director demanded that mixture, when in sequel it proves different.If director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. with his brave attempt, had the best intentions to make decent prequel to the Carpenter's masterpiece he fails. The way how Carpenter manage to make original product did not pass here.The CGI in this movie is special story of lacking. It was obvious synthetic, shallow and funny work. I admire the work of all of the artists here, but this is not even close to the Rob Bottin's wizardry or to something to be scary and gut wrenching effects. It was not funny, more painful I should say, to see how bad it was.I don't believe that John carpenter had bigger budget then, but this kind of CGI effect are a shame. What insults me is stupid realization of the monster in all of his parts.The charisma of Russell or McReady in Carpenter's ""Thing"", was juts an attempt through woman character here. Music score were not even close to scary realm, yet another Hollywood summer type suspense musical hit.What were obvious as an unoriginal work also were that ""The Thing"" title that was not inventive at all. It is far from what H. Hawks and Carpenter made.So I can write so much more but what is the point? Who will anyway read my review that lacks in solid English? But maybe someone is sharing the same feeling. I know that I share it with many loyal fans of Carpenter's movie. I just need to express that.Not that we expected the same what Carpenter did, or to watch it strictly through Carpenter's eyes, but rather something serious and original. With all that technical possibilities it might be something to be remembered. Or the classic special effects still holds that realism? Like comparing CD with Vinyl? At the end it just looks like another modern Hollywood block buster product.I will rather stay with Carpenter's movie and new issues on Blu Ray which is not bad. I hope that there will be fresh even better copy with some additional materials for us, truly devoted Carpenter's ""The Thing"" fans.",The Thing

208,Matador07,Useful Teaching Tool,6,29 February 2012,"First of all let me get out of the way that I consider the 1982 Carpenter The Thing to be possibly the best horror film ever made, or at least the scariest. I get that out of the way to start so that this next statement has meaning: this one was not awful. But neither was it good.I titled this review ""useful teaching tool"" because when I got done watching this one it occurred to me that you had two movies with the same creature idea, same setting, similar character types etc. etc., as obviously this movie was following the plot and aping the 1982 at every turn. And yet two movies with so many close similarities, and still such wildly different emotional impacts. The 1982 movie was terrifying on a first watch. The paranoia and isolation combining with the brilliant creature idea was just an unbeatable combination. And now this movie comes along...wants to be worthy of the 1982 version, and yet leaves almost no impact at all. They should study all the little differences between the two that add up to such a wildly different result.The actors never distinguish their characters enough for you to care, the unseen and unknown, which are truly what power great horror films, are trampled here by a director who apparently did not understand their power. There is very little slow build of tension, or lingering shots designed to create unease. Even the score is mediocre and lacks the unsettling simplicity of the 1982's simple baseline. Somehow this is a movie that legitimately wants to be a worthy successor to the 1982 version, and yet gets all the details wrong an ends up as just another mildly entertaining monster movie.Its entertaining enough and you can spend the second half of the movie watching the mostly unsatisfactory attempts by this one to tie itself into the original -- again so often the answers they find to the great mysteries of the original are just pedantic. I didn't want my time back or anything. But it simply does not ever get into your head or your soul. It was OK, I watched it, I can already say I will feel no real desire to watch it again. And that's too bad really. It wanted to be better, should have been better, had everything the 1982 version had working for it, and just got in a rush and ended up mediocre.",The Thing
209,janus-20,"""He works like a bear !"" WTF ?",2,9 April 2012,"Just watched this today, bank holiday, check, raining, check, what a great way to pass the afternoon, right ? NO.Setting aside mixed metaphors such as the one above, this was very disappointing and i don't enjoy having to report this, but its the truth.The dialogue ranges from functional, just about moves along the plot, to banal, ""i think......"", ""I Didn't BRING YOU HERE TO THINK !""The beginning was reasonable enough, then it was all downhill, the characters had no character, the story just replicated the events of the original 1982 movie (maybe the writers are The Thing ?) , the oral hygiene scene played out virtually identically to the wire in the blood scene from John Carpenter's movie. Except that in terms of suspense the new movie had done nothing to earn it by that point, when that scene came around in the 82 version, you had a sense of the characters, there had been clues as to who may or may not have been the Thing. There had been cut away scenes to establish isolated characters, plot points (who had the key to the blood cabinet?), offending underwear with certain peoples names stitched into it, found in incriminating places. Here the Thing not only manifests itself in bright, well lit places, in full view of, oh, pretty much everyone, it attacks and pursues people and every incarnation of it in this movie was virtually the same creature.The only two notable exceptions were the stretched face guy, (the one taken back to the American camp in the 82 version) and the one they confront at the end, (which looks a hell of a lot like one of the original conception drawings i saw in an old issue of Fangoria back in 82).All this does is to negate any need it has to hide and replicate others as well as it can, thats its natural defence mechanism, paranoia does the rest. Which really undermines the whole ""who goes there ?"" concept. Thats where the suspense and dare i say, fun of the original starts from. There's no wow factor, today of ""how on earth did they achieve that effect"", like the defibrillator scene in the original, its now replaced with instantly recognisable cgi, which destroys all movie magic. This film adds nothing of any consequence to the overall concept of the Thing, that the original 1982 version already covered, so why make it, it spends the last twenty minutes scrupulously setting up the original, which is the one thing it does really well (hence 2/10).Except the axe in the door, the reason its there in the new movie, seems to miss that in the original when MacReady pushes through that door there are objects barricading it on the opposite side, as if someone was trying to break through that door, possibly to the slashed wrists guy in the next room. Overall i didn't enjoy it and its a shame, because i wanted to and i tried to give it a chance. But it just repeated instead of expanding, there was no suspense, just cheap jumps, the dialogue wasn't naturalistic (like the original), the characters were characterless and the creature didn't come close to matching the originality of the Rob Bottin version. I still think something interesting could be done with the Thing concept, this wasn't it and i smelt studio meddling in this movie all the way through it.",The Thing

There are a lot of things that it seems the other reviewers are not pleased with. I for one am pleased with this film. The film makers went to such pain staking details so that the lovers of the original film would be happy with the outcome. I know I am. I also know that I think that this is better than most of the stuff that Hollywood has been remaking over the past few years. I personally hate remakes and John Capenters The Thing is about the only one that I have really liked. This move is not a remake and that made me happy. Yes I think that some things are better left the way they were made the first time.For example, I would hate to see a remake of Casablanca, The Searchers, Gone With the Wind, or African Queen.

214,markdroulston,Blasphemy!,3,2 November 2011,"It's a reasonably safe bet to say that very rarely will a remake of a film meet the standard set by an original, as of course if the source material was bad in the first place, a remake would likely not even be considered. The number of times a remake is better than the original can probably be counted on one hand. Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven and David Cronenberg's The Fly spring to mind as a couple of those rare examples. And, of course, John Carpenter's 1982 masterpiece The Thing, which goes beyond being a superior remake to being considered one of the finest sci-fi/horror films ever made. As for prequels, it's hard to come up with a single example that improved on its predecessor. In modern Hollywood, there are prequels, there are remakes, and then there is Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.'s 2011 version of The Thing.Ostensibly a prequel of a remake, The Thing finds itself uncomfortably torn between the two. The story concerns the initial discovery of an alien artifact buried deep under the ice of Antarctica, and the events that follow lead directly to the opening scene of Carpenter's 1982 film. So, it's a prequel, right? Well, not quite. The way the events unfold is almost a beat-for-beat copy of the earlier film, and a number of well- known scenes from Carpenter's version are recreated. So maybe it's a remake?I don't know, and it seems like van Heijningen doesn't know either. There's only one sure way to clarify what this movie is: terrible. Van Heijningen's The Thing is derivative, pointless, four- quadrant filmmaking at its absolute worst. It tries so hard to recreate the atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia of Carpenter's film, but fails to engage on any level.The problems go well beyond what any comparison with the 1982 version could reveal, but by trying so hard to mimic the far, far superior film, van Heijningen holds his film up to be judged against it, and it's not pretty. The first issue lies with the characters. To lead the story, Carpenter gave us RJ Macready, played by Kurt Russell at the peak of his badass days. Van Heijningen gives us Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Sam Carter (Joel Edgerton), unnecessarily dividing the Macready role to make way for a female lead, obviously in the hopes of expanding the potential audience by drawing women to the cinema. Winstead does the best she can, but it's difficult to buy her as an expert paleontologist, particularly when there doesn't seem to be any real reason for her character to be there. She is even told that she isn't there to think, just to make sure they can get the thing out of the ice. Why a scientific facility doing research on things drilled out of the ice needs to bring in an 'expert' from America to help them drill a thing out of the ice is never made clear, but I guess they needed to get the American stars in there. A female lead in a sci-fi/horror film has worked before, but it's not the case here. As for Edgerton, he seems to be there simply because he looks tough and has a beard (like Macready!). As for the other characters, they really aren't given much of a chance to establish themselves, so it's hard to care as they are picked off one by one. Carpenter subtly developed his supporting characters to make audiences feel for them, but van Heijningen simply throws them all out there and tries to focus on an unconvincing lead.Perhaps the two most enduring elements of Carpenter's The Thing were the terrifying special effects and the excellent ambiguous ending. The new version fails here as well, with atrocious CGI which lacks a tenth of the impact of the 30 year-old practical effects, and a woeful third act that obliterates what little atmosphere the film had developed. The men of Carpenter's version were not heroes, they were simply working-class guys faced with a situation they were ill-prepared for and ill-equipped to deal with. Van Heijningen insists on giving audiences an awful 'hero moment', before ruining the one slightly interesting plot point by having a character spell everything out for the audience. It's insulting that Hollywood filmmakers nowadays don't trust their audiences enough to pick up on nuanced visual cues, we must have everything very deliberately spelled out for us. And the less said about the ham-fisted credit sequence, the better.2011′s The Thing is among the most redundant and dreadful prequel/remakes since Gus van Sant remade Psycho. It is a film to be avoided, particularly if you have any attachment to Carpenter's 1982 version. Thankfully the legacy of the previous film cannot really be scarred too badly, as it's unlikely anyone will remember van Heijningen's The Thing by this time next year.tinribs27.wordpress.com",The Thing

Maybe they murdered him in human form but just didn't see that as happening with the co pilot standing by and watching.This is the kind of movie that bugs me when it comes to reviews. It was a solid movie. If it wasn't being compared to the original, I think it would be rated higher. But I guess that's the risk you take in making a remake.",The Thing
217,martijn-56,"Entertaining and done with care, but not the knock-out quality of the first one!",7,28 November 2011,"I am Dutch and since my name is Martijn van Heeringen, I thought I almost read on IMDb that I was going to do a prequel of the Thing, rather than Matthijs van Heyningen! Let me also say I am a big fan of the 1982 version of John Carpenter, too. So how did this highly anticipated prequel work out? I did entertain me, and I think it measured up to Hollywood standards; good acting, good effects, it surely does not look like a B-movie. But, of course the 'but', it was not the knock-out that the 1982 movie was, and still is, like Halloween 1978. Maybe we should not want to compare, but it is difficult not to. One of the reasons we got a prequel in the first place and not a remake was the makers thought it would be like putting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. So the good news is, they were fans of the original too. This shows also in the great care they took in continuity with respect to the first movie; all the stuff we saw there in the Norwegian camp had to make sense in the Thing 2011, and it did I think. Indeed, enough story and stuff we had not seen before of what happened in the Norwegian camp to make another movie. So I am happy it came out anyway. Let me try to compare the two. What made the Carpenter movie great was that everything worked; the actors, the way things were filmed, the effects (even great today; the maker had to be taken to hospital to rest, after almost a year continuous work!) and the music. The pulsating sound in the beginning was hard to shake off, and although Ennio Morricone got a Razzy Award for his score, I think we can now say it was not too computerized at all, but rather a perfect sinister syn th sound that perfectly mirrored the pending doom, if this mysterious, unseen and ever shape shifting creature, more powerful than we could imagine, coming from far behind the stars (et cetera), would make it out. In the Thing 2011 the music does not amplify the tension nor help the horror feeling at all. Rather, we are swept into a lot of fast action of the shape shifting alien, which shows itself way too much. Of course we want to see stuff now since CGI is hip, but wasn't Jaws I so great just because you did not see the shark so often? The Thing 1982 was paranoia, blood, gore and terror. The Thing 2011 had a bit paranoia in the same style, but then becomes a monster chasing movie until the end, which somehow sizzles out. The reason is just a combination of many small things, which I will try to sum up. Although I liked the female protagonist in the Thing 2011, it is just like AVP another effort to mimic Ripley of Alien, which was a bad choice, since it reminded us too much of remake characters (the mustache on Mona Lisa again). Take Kurt Russell; throwing ice in the chess computer. We know straight away he is a bit nasty, a drunk possibly, tough anyway to be wanting to live in the Arctic. Also his attitude after finding the space ship; rather than being interested in making the discovery of the Millennium etc, he wants to go back to his shack and drink, commenting to ask the doc about the alien. All he knows it is from outer space, different from us. Somehow I liked this character, and I wanted him to survive, and being who he was, it was credible Kurt did (especially after shooting a colleague). For this woman in the Thing 2011 I care since she was cute and smart, but she should have been nasty like Kurt was, to be able to fight the even nastier alien. Then, the filming technique; take the 1982 version with the dog slowly walking through the place with the creepy corridors (again, the pulsating computer sound of Morricone), entering a room with only a shadow of his first victim, unknown to the viewer, turning his head; later we know, aha, this person was taken over. This was stuff that you could easily miss, but was brilliantly done, worth watching the movie over and over again for. The Thing 1982 also left more to your own imagination: the UFO, and the alien itself, the Norwegian camp destroyed but what happened there? That worked very well, and the paranoia in the group did the rest: what if the paranoia was true and this alien could take over a person? I remember being shocked when I saw Bennings in the 1982 one, the bold guy with the big eyes and the red beard, howling, before he was burnt, with his unfinished hands still dripping. Also the slowly built up tension of the blood test, remember? The Thing 2011 showed the UFO, even the alien in the ice, and even the who is who did not matter almost, since it turned out almost all were alien, to such an extent that it was not even shocking anymore. Also, sets is an issue: in 1982 I got more the feeling it was cold, dark and isolated there; Kurt with an icy beard lighting a stick in dark basements, where in the Thing 2011 sometimes the actors didn't even have a hat on outside! Possibly the CGI made the alien and the rest too clean. In 1982 there was no computer to help, so what you saw looked at least like real blood, bones and gore. Now it looked plastic. The only plus for this 2011 version is we now know what happened there, and how the UFO looked like inside (big, blue, mysterious) – that I must say was well done. All in all: go see it, since it is entertaining.",The Thing
218,knowyourmovie,"Watchable, but unoriginal, unimaginative, and overall inferior remake",6,21 March 2012,"Here is the thing: ""The Thing"" claims to be a prequel to the famous 1982 John Carpenter's movie with the same name. In fact, however, a diligent, thorough, but unoriginal, unimaginative, and overall inferior remake that lacks visionary directing, good story, and impressive visual effects. It is not surprising therefore, that in comparison to the classic 1982 movie with its high 8.2 rating on IMDb and the ""fresh"" 78% rating on ""Rotten Tomatoes"", the 2011 flick looks rather pathetic with its mediocre 6.3 and the ""rotten"" 36% respectively. Moreover, while the John Carpenter's movie celebrated a box office success, the new remake did quite poorly in that area by gathering only $27.5 million in the theatres worldwide -significantly less than its $38 million production budget.Although ""The Thing"" is a watchable, engaging horror with enough suspense evenly spread throughout the movie, it still looks like an expectedly failed attempt to remake the classic without providing adequate means for that. It turns out that the 2011 movie was a shortsighted effort of the two unfortunate producers, Marc Abraham and Eric Newman, who were determined to repeat a relative success of their previous remake – Dawn of the Dead (2004). Inspired by their successful first attempt, Abraham and Newman acquired a taste for producing remakes, started searching Hollywood libraries, and eventually set their choice on ""The Thing"". They even managed to convince a big Hollywood studio – ""Universal"" in the viability of the questionable (in hindsight) project. Remaking or rebooting a well-known classic is always a risky undertaking that requires first-class effort, starting from finding a visionary director, whose talent is comparable to the talent of the director of the original movie. It also requires a good screenwriter, capable of creating a having an independent value, distinctive script, comparable to the original. A solid acting and imaginative high quality special effects (if applicable) are a must as well.Out of all these requirements, the 2011 remake satisfies only one: decent acting. It is especially true for Mary Elizabeth Winstead who delivers an outstanding performance as paleontologist Kate Lloyd, who quickly becomes an informal leader of the facing an imminent danger Antarctica colony. The rest of the not widely known cast does a solid job supporting the strong female lead. I would specifically like to mention Ulrich Thomsen, who managed to create an interesting, memorable character (Dr. Sander Halvorson) despite having a very limited screen time at his disposal.Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.'s directing was professional but quite ordinary, not even remotely comparable to the uniquely styled John Carpenter's directing. The script (Eric Heisserer), although engaging, was light on mystery and intrigue and too predictable even for a remake and even more so for a prequel. It predominantly dwelled on cheap scares and failed to continuously maintain an adequate level of creepiness. In addition, the subplot related to the alien space ship, was somewhat vague, confusing, and leading nowhere. It is possible, that the authors were planning to utilize it in the sequel, but taking into account how poorly ""The Thing"" did in the theatres, the sequel is not very likely to happen.Finally, it is hard to underestimate the importance of the visual effects in an alien creature horror flick like ""The Thing"". Unfortunately, what we saw in the 2011 movie was less than inspiring. Not only the special effects lacked inventiveness and imagination, but they also seemed to be somewhat unbalanced: excessive up to the point of being unnatural even for an alien horror movie in some scenes, and scarce, derivative, and underdeveloped in the other scenes. The movie's over-reliance on the digital effects for creating the monsters was aggravated by the lack of attention to the smaller surrounding details, extremely important for making the monsters look believable and creepy.Overall, 2011 ""The Thing"" can definitely serve as a decent one-time thoughtless entertainment for a horror movie fan, but it is hardly useful for anything more than that. knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",The Thing

220,TheReviewMaster,"Imitation: This truly is ""The Thing""",6,27 July 2015,"I'm writing this review only to say that after being drunk and rewatching this film I had a minor revelation about why they would call this prequel to the amazing ""The Thing"", ""The Thing"".At first I had thought the film makers were lazy. Then I thought they were just trying to express how perhaps the prequel and the original were in fact one singular movie. But what I realised upon this last drunken viewing was that: The Thing, the creature itself, is an imitator. And that's exactly what this movie is. The Thing replicates a person (or a movie) that already exists, yet when it imitates this person (or movie), it is merely a poorer, less accurate version of this person (or movie).This movie is literally: The Thing. It is an imitation of, The Thing. Yet it cannot fully replicate its brilliance. It is just a copy. And looking at the movie (and its title) with this logic and viewpoint makes it far more enjoyable.",The Thing

222,gtbarker,Disappointed and the shaky camera thing please..,1,4 April 2012,**SPOILERS** I was really looking forward to seeing this film and felt reassured by the reverent comments the makers made to Carpenter and the original. But to me this film was a real let down and it was as if they set out to tie the story into the original and then couldn't be bothered and so just tagged the dog and the two Norwegians bit on at the end because they had virtually nothing to do with the actual plot progression to that point. There was also very little character development where the original gave us individuals this just gave us a bunch of homogenous Scandinavian clichés. There were some good moments but overall I was very disappointed and do people really still do the shaky camera thing? To me it was always annoying and naff and now it's really annoying and really naff.,The Thing
223,lothos-370-690020,A Decent effort,7,27 November 2012,"I watched the original many years ago and found it to be one of the scariest films I have ever seen. Even now after so many years it still manges to send chills down my spine, and although the special effects haven't aged well the story is timeless. The John Carpenter film being a remake of the 1951 film The Thing from Another World, stays far closer to the original story from the novel, Who Goes There by John W. Campbell Jr. While I like this film a lot, I must admit the acting from the original was better, the characters more defined and more memorable. That said, I believe had this version been made first, it would have had much better reviews all round.I believe most of the really bad reviews of this title suffer from unrealistic expectations from this prequel. Many of the gripes surround what critics voiced were things left out that would have improved the film, but I am sure that had they included all those suggestions, they simply would have moaned about those features instead. Things like, concentrating on the two guys at the end, more exploration of the aliens origins. I think the director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. chose to do the brave thing here and not pander to the whims of the fans, but instead opt for a more subtle approach. Instead of answering all the questions, or copying the behaviour of the creature from the original, he chose to show how the creature leaned not to under estimate humans and began acting more cautious due to its exposure to the Norwegian camp and its inhabitants. Hoewever even here the fans have completely ignored the character on the helicopter who only chose to reveal itself when its plan to escape was unmasked and it attempts to take control of the helicopter. In addition the creature lures the most obvious threat to its plans, the female lead to a secluded room to assimilate her. As for the lack of tension, I do not feel the same level of tension on reviewing the original I once did, and suspect neither does anyone else. If Matthijs had made an film with the same tension brought from everyone second guessing each other throughout, the complaint would have been its a complete ripoff, whereas the film attempts to tell the story from an alternative perspective. (I know this didn't stop some reviewers complaining about exactly that, but there is only so much scope in a two stories with almost identical settings, characters and situation, so I chose to ignore them.)Generally few sequels live up to the expectation of the original and this film is no exception. An extremely long wait between films, coupled with a fans base not unlike the lucasistes, meant this was never going to get a fair review. Personally I thought it was an interesting prequel, that didn't suffer from creating more questions than it answered.",The Thing
224,SeanDTheFilmMaker,WOW finally a movie worth watching this year,10,30 October 2011,"I think my number one complaint is that they don't make sci-fi or sci-fi horrors like this. Everyone is trying to make those retarded twilight movies. So I feel lucky when something like this gets made. My wife needed to see the original one first so we watched it before seeing this one. I was expecting an all CG movie but noticed that it was rarely used and only for scenes that were necessary.To start with the movie had the same eerie way of catching you off guard. Some of the stuff would happen and took you a moment to catch up to the horror that was playing out on the screen. And I must say they paid every respect possible to the original, you could probably edit the two films together seamlessly. Something George Lucas could never do.....at all...period.I could express what a delight we couldn't stop talking about this movie after we saw it, its worth seeing for sure.

225,jackharding89-1,Some things are best left alone...,5,9 April 2012,"Question: how do you craft a stand-alone and worthy prequel to a seminal slice of horror movie-making without cocking it up? The answer: not like this. So well-made and accomplished was John Carpenter's eerie, Hitchcockian classic that a straight remake was and should never be on the cards. If you're going for a prequel then you're still on wafer-thin ice. One wrong move (eg- using the same title) and the cracks start to appear, a few more and it's goodnight Viena.One or two neat tie-ins to its 1982 source aren't enough to warrant the new Thing's conception. The set-up and scenario are virtually like-for-like yet the taut, tense and claustrophobic tones that ran so rich throughout Carpenter's finest film just don't come to pass in director Mathjis Van Heigimgen's toothless Thing. It may as well have been a remake.Yes, the SFX are an improvement (of sorts) but it's surprising just how well they still hold up in Carpenter's pre-CGI creature feature. Some of the greatest horror films ever made relied little on the quality and exposure of on-screen gore and ghouls (The Exorcist, Jaws, Alien, The Mist). Heigimgen obviously didn't care for these films. Consider Carpenter's Thing; the fear and impact conjured rests not just on the nail biting, paranoid set-ups but in the mystery surrounding the Thing itself. Where did it come from? What does it want? What the hell is it? And what the exactly happened in that Norwegian camp? These questions, though, need not be answered. But where there's money to be made, there's always room for stale movies that rest on the shoulder's of giants.Granted, this prelude can be understood and even enjoyed by those with zero knowledge of the original. But for those who know better, this isn't the real thing. The tale takes place in a Norwegian research camp somewhere in Antarctica. It's 1982 and after unearthing an ice bound, shape shifting alien, a group of US scientists start poking it with sticks; it breaks free and reeks havoc. Picking off the camp members one by one on its way to supremacy. Sound familiar? Gone to an extent, then, is the mystery surrounding the creature and the ravaged camp. This Thing is a daft rendition of Carpenter's sublime Alien in the artic tale whose only glimmer of class lies in its transitional ending credits.Shelf this one with 2009's Predators and the other pointless retools of recent times. If this is a sign of things to come from prequels to timeless sci-fi treasures then Prometheus (Ridley Scott's highly anticipated prologue to Alien) is going to hurt. But with Scott at the helm and Michael Fassbender on board, there is still hope for a break in this banal trend.",The Thing

Not only that, but she became the most important character in the film! Can't Americans stand to watch films without Americans in them? Pathetic! Unlike others, I found the CGI effects good, only there was too much of them. The creatures are more special and scary if they are used sparingly. I think, that they solved the mystery too quickly, lessening the already-meagre suspense. The actors were mere cyphers with very little character.

Loved the simple premise of an ancient alien life form being able to replicate human and when it failed to completely do so the results were grotesque and twisted. Whilst this is not a unique concept this movie managed to pull it off to horrifying effect. And everyone at some point being suspected of being its' host, whilst also not unique, added to its' overall effectiveness. Nice couple of twists there at the end too.

230,patrickwigington,No Match for Carpenter's Original,4,17 November 2011,"There is something fundamentally disturbing about a predator alien that can copy exactly anything it devours. John Carpenter's 1982 version of The Thing was all at once scary, disturbing, and psychological. The hysteria of cabin fever mixed with the slimy, grotesque mechanics of the alien created one of the greatest horror movies of all time. This prequel, however, takes everything that was great from its predecessor and throws it out the window.Carpenter's film hinted at a Norwegian outpost in Antarctica that had first discovered the alien. This film gives a disappointing and predictable account of what may have happened there. The first of many flaws in the script comes when Americans travel several thousand miles to help dig up the alien space ship. Now we know they aren't cut off from the rest of the world, so what's the big deal? Much of the ""suspence"" seems to take place in broad daylight, which makes being scared more of a hassle than something the audience would enjoy. And as the film goes on, it becomes clear that Carpenter's building of suspense among the characters is now gone in favor of a stupid slasher plot.The acting is dull and uninteresting—far from the bad ass, bearded Kurt Russell. Instead we get Mary Winstead, who seemingly only got the part because she acts like Jodie Foster. Heijningen's direction is so boring and dry that it becomes nearly impossible to focus on the screen. So, with a poor script, bad acting, and worse direction, what is to be liked about this film? Perhaps the Thing itself is still gruesome and disturbing?But, of course, its not. The original version was helped tremendously by the fact that the Thing was actually there for the actors to look at. It made the alien feel more real—seeing the slime and blood covered monster as it sucked up its victim. But in the prequel all we get is a computer animated blob of grossness that is too far mobile to be frightening. Not to mention, the most boring parts of the film are when the Thing is attacking.The Thing prequel suffers from one fundamental flaw—it seeks to answer questions from the original that were far better being left to the viewers' imagination. As a result, the movie shows us too much, and one can only leave the theater disappointed, and imagining far scarier ways this prequel could have happened.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",The Thing
231,Nyx_Selene,A monster movie like many others,5,24 April 2012,"""The Thing"" (2011) is for all intents and purposes the prequel to the 1982 version with the same name: It tells the story of how Norwegian scientists on an Antarctic base find an alien craft, as well as the alien, buried in the ice. They recruit a paleontologist, his assistant and his grad-student to help with the recovery of the alien, which they bring back in its frozen state to the base. There, somehow, it wakes up, and I think it's safe to say that it didn't come in peace.I am a huge fan of Carpenter's version from 1982, but I won't compare this movie to that one, other than saying that the two are very similar in style regarding the visuals, which I consider to be a good thing. The 2011 ending also connects to the 1982 beginning in a good way.Other than this, the 2011 is by no means terrible, but it is little more than your average monster movie. It's hard to call it scary, but easy to call it yucky, because it doesn't rely on tension or people - it relies on CGI. This seems to be very common today, so I wasn't surprised, but still a bit disappointed that the creators didn't try harder. They attempted to mirror elements from the 1982 version, but this felt forced to me, like they had a checklist they were just working through. I do love that they gave the movie some authenticity by hiring Norwegian actors, and having a lot of the lines read in Norwegian, but then again, was very disappointed by the lack of character in the characters. We never really get to know any of the them; not who they are or what they do. They are merely names shouted in heated situations; as the plot elements, no more than points to be checked off the list.The alien gets almost more screen time than the actors, and measures were taken to make it as hard on the stomach as possible, but the art of boring is the art of saying everything, and this movie says too much. It makes me wonder why a shape-shifting organism would so openly make such a ruckus, given that perfect imitation and stealth must be the greatest tactical advantages one could have. It also sacrifices mystery and horror for cheap jumping-out-from-around-the-corner-scares.All in all, I wish it had aimed higher; at horror movie instead of monster flick, because the potential was there.",The Thing

234,siobhanmckibbin,The Thing returns!!,5,29 January 2012,"The Thing first hit the big screens back in 1982 and now it has been remade as a prequel for a 21st Century audience. After my initial viewing, I could not help but feel entertained, however my heart still belongs to the original film which John Carpenter brought to the cinema. Well after all he is a genius of horror.So the scene is set at a Norwegian base, where Kate Lloyd who has been recruited by Dr Sander Halvorson. Their mission is to aid an Antartic dig of a great discovery; an alien specimen found frozen in the ice near to its ship. With the help of Norwegian Scientists, they recover the body to the safety of the base. Soon they discover that not only is the specimen alive, but it also has the ability to consume the shape of that which it kills.The filmmakers did their best to keep close to the same style which John Carpenter used. There are lingering shots of cold, icy weather, and also lingering shots of mysterious hallways, which both in their own right create an atmospheric feel. The music chords that play along to these shots build feelings of dread. The various transformations of 'The Thing' are interesting, and even though they may be done in CGI, I found them to be both realistic and well executed.I did feel that the casting for this film was not great. There were no stand out performances. One of the main problems came from the main female protagonists Kate Lloyd.(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)I found her performance severely lacking, and could not engage with her on any level. She may have taken control in what she was saying but her actions were weak and unbelievable. In my opinion if her character was in John Carpenter's version, she wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes, let alone the entire film.Overall the film does provide good entertainment. There is plenty of effects, action and explosions to ensure an audience is still captivated. The Thing is not a bad homage to the original. It failed to replicate the same essence as John Carpenter did, and in ways although it brings something new its all still too familiar. But be warned do not stop watching until the credits have finished. There are some short scenes which tie nicely into the beginning of the 1982 version.",The Thing

The idea  that absolutely no one can get a grasp on such a situation  regardless of any form of rationalism, in essence, everyone acts totally irrational. Is there a lesson here?

237,JobsBronson,It keeps the pace and has solid visual effects,8,19 October 2020,"A solid addition to this franchise that I love so much.

238,MC1-Bjornson,Ain't No Thangggg . . !,6,29 December 2011,"""The Thing"" (2011), Rated ""R"" for Adult Situations, Profanity, Graphic Violence and Carnage. Running Time: 1hr&42mn. - Two & 1/2 Stars (out of Four) Oh my, my, myyy! Just a few weeks ago I was poking fun at a certain 'tween-vamp-romp when I made a reference to a certain '80s monster movie. Who knew ""Twilight"" would ever foreshadow ""The Thing""?The 2011 incarnation of ""The Thing"" serves as the prequel to the 1982 John Carpenter horror film of the same name. Mind you, to call the 1982 film ""the original"" would be incorrect. Carpenter's movie is actually a remake of the 1951 film ""The Thing from Another World"" and was a silver screen McCarthyism metaphor. In comparison, the 1982 Carpenter version was an-all out horrific monster movie special effects extravaganza. In fact, when I first caught Carpenter's flick as a lad in the '80s, it definitely disturbed me. Though the 1982 film bombed at the box office, it gained cult status via cable television, home video and word of mouth. Now we have the 2011 prequel to Carpenter's movie. In fact, if you stick around for the end credits you will see ""cookies"" on how this movie directly ties into the introduction of the 1982 film.This new film centers on what actually happened to the joint Norwegian/American research group whose camp was discovered at the beginning of Carpenter's film. Norwegian scientist Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen, ""Fringe"") finds an alien spacecraft under a 100,000-year-old layer of ice. He enlists the aid of Dr. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, ""Live Free or Die Hard"") for the examination and research on the frozen life form found not far from the craft.Shortly, The Thing is revived from its icy cocoon and wreaks havoc on the camp. It is a malevolent grotesque oozing monstrosity that mimics the people and creatures it kills and absorbs. The Thing could be anybody or anything. It could be your best friend or your dog. Having said this, it is hard to say what the true appearance of The Thing might actually be. When it's not in a guise, it is shown only as a writhing bloody mass of organs, tentacles, teeth, beaks, crab legs, claws and exhibits other nasty, gooey monster qualities.As the researchers fall prey to The Thing, mistrust and apprehension divides the group. They don't know who could be a Thing and who is human. Everyone is out for themselves. They are far from civilization at their remote Antarctic location without help or backup. All they have for self preservation is anything that can be used as a weapon, namely flame-throwers and guns. Where can they go? How can they escape? Will they make it through the night? Though this new movie is faithful in tying into Carpenter's film, it just doesn't grab me the way that one did. Notably, it didn't seem inspired to me. I guess it has what some fans would want: more of the same. My problem with that is horror film audiences have seen it all before. These types of situations and monsters have been done better in other movies, not just the '82 film.I think therein lies the problem. When we first saw Carpenter's film, it was innovative, disturbing and original (though it was a remake). It was cutting edge at the time. Not this time. It's almost 30 years after the last movie came out. There have been all kinds of sci-fi horror thrillers since then with varying degrees of quality and success. That's when I realized The Thing is really a one trick pony. You don't get anything else from it because it can't do anything else. Even Winstead's heroine of this movie is borrowed from another, better monster film franchise: the ""Alien"" series. Both Dr. Lloyd and Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) are observant, logical, vocal and proactive. It is obvious this film wanted a new hero to contrast the one in '82's movie, MacCready (Kurt Russell), but now there is no reinventing the wheel. So when all else fails, borrow from ""Alien."" That's too bad.I have to note the special effects. It's now weird to see The Thing as a computer animated character. When it splatters somebody, I know the blood is CGI. There's nothing realistic or threatening about it. I know the techniques used on movies now differ from those used on the '82 film. I only mention it here because I honestly felt like it was more of a distraction than an aid. There was something tangible and real about Carpenter's Thing due to the limitations in the medium Carpenter had to work with in the early '80s. The mannequin work and puppetry were performed so masterfully in that picture there was a sense of realism. Too bad that tangibility cannot be duplicated with CGI.I'm sure that there are some people who will argue this film shouldn't be judged as a companion piece to Carpenter's film, but judged on its own merit. Fine. On those terms it would be just another forgettable monster movie. In this case, ""The Thing"" 2011 gets points for being a companion piece. As mentioned, it is faithful to '82 film's continuity.Watch ""The Thing"" 2011 if you must, though it pales in comparison to the '82 offering. If anything, watch it for Carpenter nostalgia. As of this writing, his rendition is on IMDb's Top 250 at 163 with a user rating of 8.1/10. That's the one to watch, if you're into that kind of ""thing""!",The Thing
239,Fortressofdoors,When studios interfere,7,15 June 2020,"Nine years on, I'm writing this. What's left to be said at this point? If you've watched any of Studio ADI's videos on Youtube on the practical effects they painstakingly made for this movie, you know that Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr went above and beyond the call of duty, being the master craftsmen that they are, and it's easy to read between the lines to see how disappointed they (and the director) were that the studio interfered to weaken this film so it became a shell of what it was interned to be. Gone are the days when those actually making the movie were the ones calling the shots to make a film great. The ones who actually know what they are doing.With all of that said, a lot of my issues with this film are what most people had. Not enough character development, a close knit group that you actually care about. The shots are too open, no sense of isolation, the thing acts out of character, the ship wasn't blown out of the ice as depicted in the 82 film, to name a few things. What this should have been from the start, is an all male cast for one. Don't get me wrong, Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job in the role she accepted, but part of what made Carpenter's great was the cast was all male, that were paranoid, who didn't trust each other and angrily bickered with each other, just doing their jobs, when something unimaginable comes out of nowhere. Bringing a female character in was a mistake. Bringing any outsider in who wasn't Norwegian was a mistake. It should have opened at the Norwegian base. It was, for the most part, the same story taking place at two similar locations, under the same conditions. We are adult enough to be able to read subtitles as a trade off to keep this film as pure and as close to Carpenter's version as it should be. This could have been a great film. This should have been a great film. But when the studio gets involved, and you settle on a ""i guess this will do"" script, this is what you get. A ""just ok"" result, and it's a damn shame.",The Thing
240,stevenfreekin,A Great Companion Piece to the John Carpenter Film,10,16 February 2016,"I finally got to see this film and on Bluray, which is of course sharp and crisp. This film is hated here on IMDb by fanatic fans of the John Carpenter film. Although I love the Carpenter film and i consider it a masterpiece of horror and syfy, I must say this parallel story is almost just as good.The movie is pretty faithful to all that was referenced in the 1982 film. It even looks exactly the same in pretty much all departments: cinematography, production design, costume design, sound design, and even the Norwegian characters. What was great about this movie is that you can watch them back to back and it's amazing, but at the same time it's repetitive.What this movie lacks is the dread, danger, suspense, and paranoia in the original, which is strange because it actually does have it all, but since I've watched the Carpenter version about 8 times a year for the past ten years, I realized that it's the same story and the filmmakers were aware of this. Because the truth is we didn't need a prequel to the 1982 film. Basically what happened in the American Camp is what happened to the Norwegian camp. This film just shows up what we've all imaged happening in the Norwegian camp in 1982.My other favorite aspect of this film is it showed the alien ship and the alien as it transforms and attacks people without cutting away or low lighting it, because we already know the story and the outcome. The alien or the thing is pretty much like the alien in the 1982 version.The ending was great. It literally connects to the Carpenter film.I really enjoyed it and I thought it was pretty great. Great Job to the Cast and Crew. Now they need to make either a prequel to this story on how the alien crashed in Antarctica or a new expedition discovering the alien ship and the corpses of the American characters.",The Thing
241,catmagicusa,"Blood, guts and gore, Now That's entertainment?",4,21 October 2021,"First very dark lighting, then very low sound, then blasting sound, and a predictable plot.

242,neil-arsenal,A prequel that is almost the same story as 1982!,6,27 February 2012,"First of all, it was always going to be difficult to top the 1982 version. The 'monster' genre is a difficult one to get right.It seems the makers of this movie realised this and in trying to make a prequel, they just ended up copying the 1982 movie.So many scenes are similar...like testing to see who 'The Thing' is. The dog going crazy.Why the makers felt the need to make the main protagonist a woman is beyond me. Maybe they thought that was their hook. Her acting was wooden and the characters just didn't get you with them.This movie though, is not as bad as some make out. Sure, it's not great, but if you like the genre you may enjoy it.",The Thing
243,WilderMovieReviews,This is a prequel to probably one of the best horror films ever made,9,19 March 2012,"This is a prequel to probably one of the best horror films ever made, a true classic and a very good addition to the story. It tells what happened in the events leading up to the original film. The last shot of this film links to the first shot of the original.At first I was worried about this film for two reasons. First, as the film was set on a Norwegian camp how much reading would I have to do whilst trying to follow the story? Second, the original film is amazing a true classic of the horror genre. Would this film do justice to the story and would the use of modern effects change the feel of the story? My fears were soon put to rest. Fortunately it appears that the universal language for scientists working in the Antarctic is English! There are a few subtitles throughout the film but not that many. Now a big thank you to the producers of this film. It is clear that they are true fans of the original and this is evident in the title. They couldn't come up with a title better than ""The Thing"". They could have gone with The Thing: Begins but nothing sounded as good. This film was made by fans of the original and they have ensured that it links into every reference made in the original to the Norwegian base, even down to an axe in the wall seen in the first film, showing how it got there in this one. The cast is made up of very good actors, none of them are particularly well known to everyone. I recognised a few faces, but this is good as you have no idea who will survive as there no major stars.Story wise, if you have seen the original you know what to expect but the film makers know this and throw a few curve-balls in. The famous ""blood test"" of the original almost happens here but cleverly it gets change for something else also unexpected. The creatures origins are left alone and rightly so as there is no way of knowing them. It is just a creature trying to survive by killing everyone in its way. Do we really need to know more than that? The effects are also very good, but this is what you would expect from modern effects. Where the original films effects were ground breaking, the ones here are what you can see in most Hollywood creature films. The difference here is the attention to making the creature effects look like the original. Again the makers of the film have done a great job in making the two films fit together both story wise and visually. I wish all sequels/prequels would have enough respect for the audience like this one has.My nemesis(a film critic on UK radio) struck again with this film. They rated this film a ""good strong 3 stars"" asked why not 4 stars they stated that Happy Feet Two was released at the same time and this was a 4 star film and they enjoyed it more. What???! How can you compare a horror with a cartoon? Shouldn't you rate them as individual films in different genres?",The Thing
244,accountcrapper,Tight Movie,8,28 September 2013,"Honestly if you give this film less than a 7 then you haven't really thought about it very much. A classic sci-fi horror creature feature with stunning real effects, a great ensemble cast and a true passion for both previous movies. The IMDb description of the 1951 original reads ""Scientists and American Air Force officials fend off a blood-thirsty alien organism while at a remote arctic outpost"". If you have seen the 1951 version, and the and John Carpenters 1982, and you liked them, then I think it is fair to say you will like Matthijs van Heijningen's 2011 version. It is a play on a theme in regards to the basic premise so it cannot just invent a new premise. Given the basic premise I think this movie hit the tone just right. I very much enjoyed the casting. It was refreshing to see a sci-fi horror film not dominated by American types. The Norwegians were great. The ensemble acting was just excellent. The music was effectively unnerving. It had the right feel of tension and bombast. Simple never brilliant but always effective and never distracting. Just right. The CGI, animatronics and effects were just great. Although they might seem old hat to some people just think about it for a minute - really do you see people wearing animatronic suits while burning up in flames running around screaming. Most films would just go CGI and leave it at that but this film feels much more physical for doing it the right way. I applaud them and I can only hope we see more actual humans in our effects. Plasticky CGI (The Hobbit) and shaky camera action scenes (Elysium) are just not thrilling. The mixture of effects techniques and the punctuation of the music and effects very much make this movie stand out from the normal CGI laden poorly shot garbage.John Carpenter is the king of tone and beat so to think it could ever compare to the original in those terms is just unfair. This version of the The Thing was a great homage to the 1982 film and to classic sci-fi horror generally.",The Thing
245,Ben_Horror,"Okay, here's the thing about 'The Thing'...",8,13 December 2011,"When it was announced that this was going into production, there was a level of confusion/curiosity regarding what exactly it would be: remake/reboot/sequel/prequel? Also, would it utilize prosthetic effects like the 1982 original, or would it go all out CGI splatter? As it turns out, it's a combination of the former and the latter. The new 'The Thing' wants to have its cake and eat it too: you see, technically, it's a prequel but for some reason, the makers have molded it as kind of a remake as well. That's both clever and rather infuriating in equal measures. With regards to the effects, yes, they are CGI for the most part, but they look practical and are done well.Story-wise, with the exception of some additions, it hits the same beats as John Carpenter's original movie too. An alien vessel is discovered frozen in the Antarctic permafrost by a Norwegian research team. Finding a mysterious life form, they bring it back to their research station. Even though there's no mention of an American in the original, the makers shoehorn one in here, clearly unconvinced that a movie comprised entirely of Europeans would sell. And likewise, it's a female – once again, you get the feeling they're not confident that an all male cast would sell this time round and are taking no chances. The American, a palaeontologist (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is drafted into the equation by a member of the research group. Then they set about participating in a scientific study of the alien creature. Only problem is, it returns to life, and being a shape shifter that can replicate any living organism, starts to hide amongst the group, leading to lots of finger pointing, flame throwers, explosions and suspicion fueled arguments. Sounds rather familiar, right?Whereas the original 1982 movie was all about paranoia and the fear of the unknown - the alien hid among the human hosts, desperate to remain concealed at all costs, only showing itself when it felt its identity was compromised - it's distinctly not the case here. In this movie, the creature revels in revealing itself at every available opportunity. With bells ringing. It screams and shrieks its presence to such an extent that all notions of a story based on the mistrust and doubt of an isolated group of characters goes out the window. What's the point in being a shape shifter if you're going to constantly give the game away? Then there's another aspect that doesn't quite ring true: early on in the movie, the characters witness a violent helicopter crash. The logical thing would be to go out to investigate it and search for survivors but for some reason, they all choose to ignore it. Additionally, one can't help but wish the makers had called the movie by a different title; after all, if it's meant to be an official prequel to the 'The Thing', why call it the same name?It's not that it's bad movie; as remakes go, it's really rather good and executed with a lot of style. Sequel-wise, it's up there with Psycho 2. As with the original, we get a scene where there's a 'big test' as Mary Elisabeth attempts to ascertain who's who in the group. In the original, Kurt Russell used blood samples; here, they go for an admittedly clever spin on that scene, while being totally different, adds a new aspect to the creature while also playing as some kind of homage. You might even conclude that since this is a prequel, then you must know the ending, right? After all, we saw how it ended in the opening scenes of the original 1982 movie starring Kurt Russell. Wrong. While they don't violate the events, they take the movie in a whole different direction but still shrewdly stick with the original time- line. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good in this. She doesn't strut around with a ""Look at me, I'm so gorgeous"" expression; in fact she plays the role - sans make up, for the most part – with a level of icy, cool female conviction unseen in a movie about a creature from outer space since a little movie made in 1979 called 'Alien'. It can't be an accident that she reminds the viewer of the Ripley character played by Sigourney Weaver in the same movie and even possess a similarly unconventional beauty. Based on this, it wouldn't be surprising if she ended up replacing Weaver in the inevitable reboot/remake etc. of that franchise.The John Carpenter original was rightly celebrated for its surreal effects, giving audiences something that was genuinely cutting edge and never seen before at the time. Happily, there is lot of utterly bizarre transformations going on here as well that will make your jaw drop: a guy's face splits open; two men fuse together and in an attempt to outdo the spider-head of the original, we see a monstrous four-legged creation stalking its prey. While everything is 90% CGI, once again it's done in such a way that it almost homages the original. For the most part the effects here look similar to the 1982 movie, except they're done with a sheen that only CG could create. In conclusion, is it any good? Yes, it is. It's not the disaster some snotty critics would have you believe. While it's not as good as John Carpenter's move (but then, what is?), it still honors the original while effectively and cleverly building the story that lead to the events in that movie. Yes, the aforementioned 'Thing' does shout and scream a bit too much, giving away its presence all too often, but that could easily be interpreted as a legacy of its inexperience with humans. This is a prequel, after all. But don't worry - by the time Kurt Russell and pals come along, it will have learned its lesson.",The Thing
246,darkraven_109,A great companion to Carpenter's film,8,5 November 2011,"When news broke out that John Carpenter's THE THING was getting a prequel, all I could expect was a disaster. I've seen the recent prequel of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and the crappy reboot of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and based on those two I could only expect the worst from a prequel of THE THING. Since horror movies haven't been that impressive in this decade for some reason (and I really miss good horror), I was pessimistic when my friends wanted me to watch the 2011 THE THING with them.Apparently it was a good decision on my part to watch the film.Long story short, THE THING works well as a companion to Carpenter's version. The prequel manages to maintain the tension and paranoia of trying to figure out who the alien lifeform infected; thankfully this part of the film isn't predictable at all. The cast was great and the creature designs were as monstrous and hideous as the 1982 version's. The pacing was sped up a bit and this is a welcome addition to the continuity of the story. But the best part of this prequel is that it was able to connect and explain every little detail about the events that happened in the Norwegian outpost briefly shown in the 1982 film (the scene that stands out in particular for me is the ending credits sequence linking the prequel to the opening events of Carpenter's film). The writers were able to make the story make sense and fit in the continuity of Carpenter's film without sacrificing any of the tense atmosphere for fanservice or excessive gore as many modern prequels do. Up until the end, THE THING did not fail to disturb and scare me a little which is a feeling I've been missing for a long time.My only problems with the film are minor ones such as the CGI; as I said earlier it wasn't bad and in contrast I actually loved the creature designs but said creatures looked way too fake in some parts to drive in the fear accomplished by Carpenter's film. Instead of looking like the flesh-absorbing monstrosities they were imagined as, what we got resembled video game bosses thanks to the CGI. Another problem was the character of the scientist Dr. Halversen (Ulrich Thomsen) since unlike the rest of the cast, he was just a cookie cutter stereotype. Again like nearly every science fiction movie that involves a monstrosity that's clearly slaughtering the entire cast we have a jerk who wants to capture it alive all in the name of science.So overall THE THING is a fantastic horror movie with very minor setbacks. I'm not saying this is better than John Carpenter's masterpiece but rather it's simply on par with it; it's that good for me. It kept me guessing and scared all throughout its running time. In a drought of decent horror movies as horror movies these days tend to lean on the side of films that are desperately trying to look smarter than they should (the latter SAW sequels) or are just simply bad (PARANORMAL ACTIVITY), THE THING stands out as a nice return to the likes of monster movies and gore that were so popular/ notorious in the 80's. Watch it for a good Halloween fright or simply for the fun of getting scared.",The Thing
247,eronzierjoly,I miss the other Thing,6,17 September 2020,"I'm not usually one of these 'the original was much better-people' but here it goes. I have watched the original 'The Thing' many, many times. I only realised there was a new 'The Thing' when it ended up on Netflix. I watched it of course and in conclusion I thought it was alright. I drifted off a bit towards the end, it certainly wasn't an improvement on the original but in its own right it kept me mildly interested until the last 20 or so minutes. I think I expected more and better, but instead it was just very similar to the original but not as good. The annoying Norwegians who for whatever reason didn't speak a word of English were a waste. Also on a side note, the soundtrack in the original was much better and it set the tone well.I understand this may have been a prequel to the original but either way it was very similar just less everything - less exciting, less atmospheric, less engaging.

So, why I found out that this movie was a prequel, I decided to give it a chance. Terrible mistake. Yes, it's a prequel but a bad one at that. Everything they did was copying what happened in the 1982 version. Like the blood test. Though,they didn't use blood in this version, they instead used metal found in the mouth of everyone.

249,DreamerX616,Well It Was Some THING !!,7,11 June 2020,"Enjoyable sci-fi movie in and of itself (hence the 7 star rating) however it just doesn't work for me as a sequel in the sense that, given this was made 20 odd years since the original 80's movie and was meant to predate it, it doesn't feel like it, there is no retro 80's feel to it. While most of this is probably down to the progress of film making in general, giving this movie a cleaner look but when it comes down to it all the actors and set design look too present day.The final scenes as the end credits start flashing up was a nice nod to the original to link the two but too little too late I'm afraid.

Its not a revolutionary concept of alien hiding in a human body, until someone turns his/hers back on them, while they exit their shell and spill the blood around.

252,Schnayblay,"""The Thing"" - Half Remake, Half Prequel...",7,12 December 2011,"John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" was a 1982 cult horror classic that was overlooked at the box-office, but was a marvel in practical effects and suspense. Matthjis van Haijnjngen Jr's 2011 prequel takes place directly before John Carpenter's instalment, and answers some questions that we never really wanted the answers to.The plot is the same as Carpenter's vision. A team in Antarctica finds an alien, foolishly brings it to the surface, and SURPRISE! It starts killing them. It's an uninspired plot but it's all you really need, and given it's a prequel, there's not much room to change it around.The cast is okay. One of my several Hollywood crushes, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, portrays Kate Lloyd, an American Paleontologist. She's brought on the expedition as kind of a formality, but ends up being the only voice of reason and leader of the group. Her semi-love interest is played by Joel Edgerton, who plays a helicopter pilot. His character is pretty bland and as cardboard as a box, but we at least need one competent male in the bunch, so he acts as Kate's counterpart.One thing I liked in the Carpenter rendition was the nice balance of humour and horror. This version takes itself way too seriously. It has about one scene where you'll laugh, and the rest tries to be dark and suspenseful, with no lightening of tone.The special effects look pretty crappy. The Thing in the Carpenter film was never truly shown, though some gruesome transformation scenes were shown using practical effects. Robert Ebert called Carpenter's film ""a perfect barf bag movie"", and it was one of the draws. Quite the opposite case with this film, the Thing is actually shown in it's true form and is all CG. The CG is ugly. It looks like something out of a Resident Evil game, and is hardly scary at all except in close-ups. These close-ups with the thing's morphing face are, in contrast, very well done. They are truly disturbing and unsettling, as you wonder what sick bastards did the effects on this film.Another problem is the inclusion of the Thing's ship. While never shown in Carpenter's film, it has a fair amount of screen-time in this movie. The characters actually go inside it, and it takes away a lot of mystery to the Thing itself. The lack of knowledge of The Thing in the Carpenter film was what made it so intriguing. This film tells you flat out, and you feel a little angry.This film explains too much for a prequel. Being a prequel, you should know less, making it a reward to see the Carpenter film. Seeing this film pretty much answers everything you wanted to know in the Carpenter film, making newcomers to the series have no reason to see it's 1982 continuation.For example, a disability of the Thing in this film is that it can't duplicate non-organic materials. Teeth fillings, metal plates, earrings, watches, and rings will not show up on Thing duplicates. This was never shown in the Carpenter film, letting you know more about the monster, which, as said, is discouraging. But not re-hashing one of the scenes from the Carpenter films, as many of us thought it would, is nice. The screenwriters tried to bring something new to the table, but it was a table that shouldn't have been touched.The mid-credits finale is the only reason new fans will want to see the 1982 ""The Thing"". The shots are perfectly duplicated from the Carpenter's film's opening scene, and are very deceiving. You're not sure whether you're watching enhanced 1982 footage, or newly shot 2011 footage that is seamlessly no different.In the end, 2011's ""The Thing"" is a decent horror film. For this day and age, it will pass. Horror film fans of these days will accept it, as they're used to this lack of true horror, and will get right into the gore and bland characters. They'll also want to go see the Carpenter film, and will discover how much different the two really are. The 1982 fans may want to be weary. Seeing this 19-year later prequel will take a lot of mystery out of the original for you, and may spoil the reason to keep re-watching the Carpenter film.",The Thing
253,tstromsn,A very bad movie,1,1 November 2013,"If you saw the John Carpenter's The Thing from 1982, then there is no point watching this movie. Why? Well because it mainly copies John Carpenter's version with worse acting, worse story telling, plot holes and bad CGI animations. It is said that this is a prequel, but it feels more like a remake of some sort. The biggest mistake in the movie is that in carpenter's version the Norwegians blow up the alien ship in the ice, while in the 2011 version they discovered it by falling through the ice and dig tunnels down to it. I don't understand how they could f**** this up. Anyway, enough about that, later in the movie the whole thing turns into a monster chase thriller where the monsters screams and runs around chasing and trying to kill people. It totally ruins the suspense and horror the first movie had. I hated this movie, it was boring, predictable and utter useless. Avoid it at all costs!",The Thing

255,jasonbourneagain,Intense.,6,11 October 2011,"I just came back from an advanced screening and found this movie intense and entertaining for a story that we all know about and that it's a prequel to the 1982 John Carpenter's The Thing. John Carpenter's The Thing wasn't a big hit either until it came out on DVD. That said, one cannot help but compare it to the sequel while watching this prequel, so I understand why some reviewers will base their opinion on the comparison. However, it's not fair to evaluate this movie as such instead of on its own merits. Carpenter's film was compared to Howard Hawks' 1951 The Thing From Another World, and they weren't the same, yet Carpenter's version did not get it due until it came out on DVD.Now, that I ranted about not comparing the The Thing 2011 to The Thing 1982, early on in the movie, one cannot help but compare the movies and evaluate the stories and their pacing. I realize that sounds contradictory. However, just when you think this movie doesn't have the same feel for the characters and their development, it takes off with what it and Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and his crew brings to the table. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is no Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in Alien, but she and the other characters do enough, especially The Thing, to pick this movie up and move it along. The Thing prequel should grip you, revolt you, and scare you enough by putting you in the situation the characters are in. Furthermore, Lloyd didn't have the luxury of being in the sequel as Ripley. I am not sure if people who aren't fans of The Thing will rate it highly, but I think they will. There is enough in this film to move the intense and gripping tale, which everyone knows, along. If you can enjoy this movie for itself, then you should have a good time like I did. I would even say there is a twist in the ending, but one can check it out for themselves. As for The Thing fans, I think there is enough to get them peaked and talking after this one is over.ETA 8/13/2018: I had to review this movie again after finding out they had a practical effects version which the director was intending to show to the audience. I saw some of the comparisons and it was a shame that the practical effects by Amalgamated Dynamics Inc (ADI) were not used. They seemed very much top notch effects. Instead the producers chose to do CGI over the practical effects and it creates a not as real feel to it. I thought after screening this film that it was an enjoyable enough movie if one didn't compare it to John Carpernter's The Thing. But it would be difficult to not to.compare it to one of the greatest practical effects films of all time. That movie was really creepy and had more than one WTF moment. This one isn't like that even though it was okay as a standalone movie. I apologize for the rushed review and now feel compelled to lower my initial evaluation when a better/pretty good ""prequel"" was shot. Instead of what could have been a gold mine, we got the shaft.",The Thing
256,rumbleinthejungle,Pretty good for a prequel to a re-make,7,27 November 2011,"Yes - I'm a big fan of Carpenter's 1982 re-imagining of the Howard Hawks original. Yes - I was concerned when I heard that this film was being made but also intrigued at the idea of a prequel; a film telling the story of the Norwegian scientists experience with the alien seemed like a fairly original idea. Bottom line is......I liked this film. It does have a few inconsistencies but not so many as to detract from the overall viewing experience. Generally, the tone towards the '82 film is quite respectful and I think the fact that we have a non-Hollywood director heading up a largely unknown cast keeps things from being clunky and too safe. The CGI is, in my opinion, actually very well done. The creature design is absolutely spot on and manages to bring something new and fresh to the table while honoring Rob Bottin's original designs from the JC film. The creature sound effects are spot on, too. Interesting to see that this film has performed poorly at the box office. After watching this it struck me just how dark and bleak the story actually is; if anything this will probably have more success on blu-ray and DVD than it will at the cinema. To all the naysayers....I can't understand what the problem is? This could've been much, much worse. You could've had a director at the helm that had little to no interest in tying the film's together, but that side of things has been done very well indeed here; the scenes that are cut into the credits are really great. I think I might even re-watch this.......",The Thing
257,fluna1030,Excellent Prequel & Cast !,9,19 October 2011,"This is a Prequel to the 1982 movie ""John Carpenter's The Thing"". This movie takes place in the year 1982 with ""a Discovery"" by a trio of Norwigians stationed in Antarctica. Next, a young student Palientologist ...Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is being asked to participate in this discovery and is convinced by her co-worker Adam to go . . .& so, she & him go. Once there, they find an alien ship of some sort that by the looks of things, is Very Big & they document what they have found (note the video recording equipment being used). Later, as they are coming out from where they were, they also discover a Frozen body with arms that somewhat resemble tentacles without the suction cups. The block of Ice is cut out & brought back to camp for further study. As they are Toasting & Boasting to one another on their discovery, the block is defrosting. Some noises are heard & the next thing you know, the creature has Exploded out of its block of ice & is loose . . & here is where i'm going to leave it. The visual effects were Excellently Done without going overboard. It would have been nice however to actually See what the creature looks like from the start. I guess i'll have to wait for the DVD to come out for a Closer Look. Great Work by Mary Elizabeth Winstead on the part of Kate.

258,commander_zero,"This time around it's less Goth, more Gothic.",6,18 September 2012,"For a film that is excellent in many ways, but unremarkable where it counts the most, perhaps the most interesting aspect of this new version of THE THING is how it converts this (by now) venerable plot into modern Gothic. The difference of course is the introduction of Kate, a female lead character.Mind you, the great 1951 THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD had women in it— two to be exact, with Margaret Sheridan, despite her secondary role top- billed, no doubt for studio reasons that are lost to history. In this post WW-II ""THING"", the female characters were brave and capable, but they stood deferentially behind the men in the battle against the alien, and despite the skill with which screenwriter Charles Lederer laid out the romantic subplot with Sheridan and Kenneth Tobey, the female presence did not significantly impact the plot (I can't at the moment construct analogies between the scene where Sheridan tied Tobey up during a drinking bout—only to have him escape--and the scene where the men confined the frozen alien to a store room--only to have it escape— but if anyone else wants to, I'll be glad to listen).Otherwise, from its provenance as the John W. Campbell short story Who Goes There? in 1939, through to John Carpenter's 1982 version, THE THING has always been stolidly and depressingly all-male. The addition of ""Kate Lloyd"" to the plot changes its focus significantly: THE THING (2011) departs from its science fiction origins to become a Gothic thriller. A remote, controlling older man arrives without warning to spirit away an innocent (or in this case, work-obsessed) young palaeontologist to his distant castle or mansion. Once there, she has no way to escape, and has to figure out some way to avoid becoming the next wife to be locked up raving in the attic or rotting away in the icy depths beyond the pounding surf etc. In this case, Kate's task is to alert her new colleagues to the seriousness of their situation, and to avoid getting absorbed herself. Traditionally the Gothic heroine has to await rescue or reform her captor through sheer goodness. Kate however, obviously having grown up on Sigourney Weaver movies, grabs a flamethrower and starts barking orders. In the end though having suffered great losses, she still has some kind of control.Future writers are welcome to explore THE THING as a Gothic romance in all its permutations. The Carpenter version—this may have come from the original short story—even has a character who goes nuts and has to be locked up, raving, in a nearby garret/toolshed (although it turns out), and in both cases, Gothic and Sci-Fi, the protagonist's goal is to have the status quo restored and their freedom regained.So while I am willing to cast my vote in favour of the argument that Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the best thing that could have happened to THE THING (2011), even without her it has a lot going for it. It has been well-written and produced; an obvious labour of love from a writer and director who are fans of the 1982 Carpenter version. But although I tempt the wrath of its many fans, I must admit I also find THE THING (1982) notable for the sheer pleasureless creepiness of its concept and execution. It is a virtuoso work in the way that it groups together a cast of unsympathetic characters, and then pits them against each other in new and gruesome ways, killing off almost everyone starting with the dogs. But for those very reasons, watching it can be a grim and depressing experience. So in watching THE THING (2011), it's not long before, to again hark back to ALIENS, the viewer starts quoting Ellen Ripley: ""Look, I can see where this is going."" The special effects alien in all its forms is a wonder to behold, but although we enjoy the suspense of just where and when it will next appear, there is never any doubt what it will do: grab the nearest human and get down with some hideous absorbing. So in the end we have a virtuoso work, but curiously unsatisfying: why doesn't Hollywood get these talented people together again—but this time, let them do something original?",The Thing

Oh, I couldn't wait !And then after I seen it, I was ready to turn into film-terrorist and make fusion furnace out of Hollywood.How can you fail so terribly with such an opportunity, with plain, clean sheet of canvas that is left behind Carpenter, on which you can work a pure prequel magic with an altogether magical idea !?!I don't even thinking on absence of horror - it's not scary, it's not suspenseful, it's not tense, it's not dark, it's not exciting - I actually want to point out that film is illogical from the get-go, where poorly developed characters are incredible stupid even for teenagers let alone scientists, director and writer are both morons trying to make this prequel look as much identical as possible to the original (this is true !). Some characters are completely unnecessary, like for example young American palaeontologist - really, Norwegians couldn't find any in Norway or Europe - but that bit I can understand and accept since it's an American film primarily made for Americans (maybe that explains a lot ;-)), so we have couple of Americans, OK. But wait, young American female scientist, just few years past her teenage shenanigans becomes a leader, and I mean in every sense of the word, among couple of world-wide famous Norwegian scientists and dozen of deranged Vikings - really !? They all listen to her, science-wise, or ""battle tactics""-wise, and so she lead them (well, to death, mostly).At one point, after she announced that nobody should leave or escape alive or in any other shape or form, and that any of them could be the ""Thing"", and that leaving the place in small groups is exactly what ""spaceman"" wants, because then It can kill them much easily if they find themselves alone with him, she suddenly really struggles to save two other Americans who survived impossible, just to lock them both, together in the same room !?!I can't torture my self any longer !

I should start by saying I'm not blinded by nostalgia, I wasn't even alive at the time this movie's sequel aired, getting that out of the way, the movie sucked. Without trying to spoil it, the biggest reason this sucked was because it was a prequel and it had to be crafted around the 1982 movie.

One of the most disturbing things I found was the profusion of (younger?) reviewers comparing this 2011 Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. Version to ""the original"" 1982 John Carpenter version.JC's The Thing is NOT the original! That title belongs to Howard Hawks 1951 masterpiece The Thing From Another World!Heijningen's The Thing is billed as a prequel and, as such, presents a fairly coherent story throughout. One of the characteristics it shares with the Carpenter version is the proliferation of characters, muddying the water for viewers in terms of keeping track of suspects and their motivations. (I had to watch 1982's The Thing several times to get the characters straight, and I believe there's more in Heijningen's version). The actor's give noble, sincere performances, no easy task with a cast this large. Production values are more than adequate (good sets, professional editing, etc.)2011's The Thing ultimately falls apart based on two flaws: lack of suspense and timing.The film begins predictably enough, bringing the alien life form back into the base camp. It's at this point that the over-abundance of CGI begins, with scene after scene revealing another new character ""taken over"", thereby reducing the number of usual suspects. It's done in rapid fire succession and, in doing so, reduces the suspense. The viewer can't help but notice that they're rushing through the scenes. The magic in Carpenter's version is his slow delay of revelation of those ""infected"", teasing the viewer and building up the anticipation to fever pitch. Sadly, that pacing and suspense doesn't exist with the 2011 version.I did give Heijningen's version 5 stars for effort and for the logically thought out method the lead character develops in identifying the alien once the traditional method is rendered unusable.

The second time I watched it on blu ray I really liked it and became more engrossed in the nuances. I'm a huge fan of the 1982 Thing (as well as the 1951 version)so I believe I come at this being a hard core skeptic. As with the 1983 film this version has a very real dynamic going on between the cloistered players. Mary Elizabeth Winstead impressed the heck out of me portraying an outwardly bland scientist that invokes inner strength when confronted with fear. As well, her fear is genuine.Many already know this 2011 version is a prequel. I didn't think the Norwgian camp needed to be revisited but, my predilections aside, it worked very well. Many of the actors are big Norwegian film stars. One was referred to as the ""Brad Pitt"" of Norway in the DVD extras. The film basically holds to what our minds remember the creature being in the ""82 masterpiece and that goes a long way. I do agree with some reviewers that one or two CGI scenes were somewhat weak but it could also be that I am so used to the thing being ""live action"" that the CGI just throws me off for this type of creature. I would also say that some necessary dark scenes leaned a little too dark for me. I also don't understand why the film was given the title ""The Thing"". Remakes are usually entitled the same, not prequels or sequels. This could have been ""The Thing- A Beginning"" or something like that. I think the marketers needed this title to sell it to newer audiences.The movie doesn't have the memorable lines that the classic has but I can't forget the line, ""be careful, that thing went through the ------ roof"" (lol). Seeing the creatures space ship could have sunk the film but wisely this area was handled smoothly and added greater fascination. Kate's outcome left me a bit more wanting but I can live with it.

I saw this movie with friends, some of which i know (as in I've watched Carpenter's film with them) are big fans of the '82 classic, and there was a mixed bag of reviews. Everyone i saw it with enjoyed the film. Period. However, some of us enjoyed the film much more than others. One of my friends thought ""It felt too much like the original"", which to me was a good thing... With that being said, it starts slow but becomes a gore fest!!

271,ViktorDrake,Could have been great....,3,8 December 2011,"SPOILERS AHEADNow I must be honest, but I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie from the moment I saw the initial teaser trailers. Like many other reviewers here, I am a huge fan of the 1982 John Carpenter version of The Thing, which in my opinion rates as one of the top three sci-fi horror movies ever made (the other two being Alien and the 1986 David Cronenberg version of The Fly). So when I heard of a prequel being made that would be ""true to the 1982 original"", I was suitably salivating at the thought, but unfortunately films rarely live up to that kind of anticipation. And sadly so it is with The Thing (2011).As a standalone (but ultimately completely forgettable) monster movie, The Thing (2011) just about works. JUST. It has a bit of suspense, some fairly gory deaths, an interesting-enough creature design, and a ready supply of disposable characters to be butchered in fun and bloodthirsty ways. HOWEVER, as a prequel to one of the finest sci-fi horror movies EVER, it falls rather short.First of all, there's the continuity/anachronism issues. Supposedly set in 1982, the hairstyles (especially the Kate Lloyd character's) really aren't '80's at all. There are also technology anachronisms aplenty – a flat screen PC being the most notable. But the biggest issue for me is the continuity between the two films. The director allegedly had a copy of the movie to hand throughout shooting to ensure continuity, although a few glaring errors in the movie make me wonder whether the DVD was used as coaster for the director's cup of tea instead of being used as a reference to guide key continuity points. For example, in the 1982 version we see a movie apparently shot by the Norwegians using explosive charges to expose the spacecraft : in the 2011 version, the spacecraft is exposed by the crafts own engines(!) – more on that later.A further example is the scene where the Kate character sits in the Snowcat after killing the Carter/Thing – where does she go, because by the time McReady turns up in the 1982 version, there's no sign of any Snowcat (or ice cave entrance for that matter) anywhere in sight of the spacecraft.A simple viewing of the 1982 version by the director might have prevented these daft continuity lapses.Secondly, the Thing itself behaves totally differently in this movie compared to the 1982 version. In the original it did all it could to stay hidden and would generally only attack someone when they were on their own with it – as McReady said, ""it's vulnerable in the open"". In the new film however, it's only too happy to parade around in the open and under bright lights in all it's CGI ""glory"" killing multiple humans at will.Thirdly, too many daft things happen. For example, we're told the spacecraft crashed 100,000 years ago, and the survivor crawled from the wreckage before being frozen in the ice. Why then does the spacecraft fire up when the Sander/Thing character escapes to the ship at the end of the movie? It kind of begs the question that if the spacecraft starts up after 100,000 years, why didn't the Thing just stay put in the first place after the initial crash, restart the engine and then fly away? I personally thought the idea was that the spacecraft was wrecked and the Thing was stranded here.Another example is the Thing's escape from the block of ice at the Norwegian's camp. After 100,000 years it suddenly bursts out of the ice, which, while we're shown a tiny drip of water coming from it, is still a damn solid lump of ice. If it can manage to burst out after 100,000 years, why did it allow itself to freeze in the first place, or not leap out at some other point? Daft.Yet another example is the entire ""running dog"" sequence shown inter-cut with the end credits in a clumsy attempt to tie the two films together. The new pilots who turn up out of nowhere (and hence know nothing about the creature), instantly believe the Lars character when he says, ""that's no dog"", despite the fact that he just shot at them!Fourthly, the new effects just aren't that good. The CGI is somewhat below par by today's standards, and I INFINITELY prefer Rob Bottin's practical effects, even today. The weirdness and jerkiness of movement they had was somehow totally in keeping with the alien character of the Thing, and quite unlike anything we'd seen before or since. In comparison, the later movie's CGI is very ""ho-hum"" and ordinary. I have never once laughed at the effects in the 1982 Thing, but I found the CGI in the 2011 version actually quite funny in places. That said, I must admit to liking the first ""autopsy"" when they initially believe the first victim was being digested instead of replicated. The practical effects used to create the victim's face in the belly of the Thing are very good indeed, although it also made me wonder how even more fantastic Rob Bottin's work could have been had he had access to modern materials in '82.Lastly, the entire ""feel"" of the 2011 version just doesn't match that of the 1982 version. The human paranoia and feeling of claustrophobia generated by the first movie was one of its defining aspects that made it such a great piece of film-making. The 2011 version is completely devoid of those elements : it's just a rather simplistic monster/chase movie.So to return to my original point – The Thing (2011) is adequate enough as a standalone monster movie, and for that I'd give it 6 out of 10. However as a prequel to Carpenter's vision, it can only muster a lacklustre 3 out of 10. A GREAT opportunity, sadly missed.",The Thing

273,rocky_lifter69,"I Appreciate The Effort, But...",2,10 February 2012,"John Carpenter's The Thing is one of my all time favorite films. In terms of atmosphere, suspense and a real sense of mystery, it is hard to find any movies that can match it. And the practical effects are still fascinating to this date, despite being a little dated at times. With so much love for the original, I had many reservations about a prequel but was willing to give it a try. While it does manage some suspense early on, it eventually succumbs to modern day horror movie clichés and becomes just another monster movie.The film is set in 1982 and focuses on a Norwegian outpost in Antarctica that makes a world changing discovery: a large extraterrestrial craft buried beneath 100,000 year old ice. They also find and extract it's alien pilot from the ice. The creature revives and kills a member of the team before being dispatched. Upon autopsying the remains, they learn that the creature has the ability to perfectly imitate other lifeforms. Soon the team isn't sure who they can trust and who is no longer human. After the team is slowly killed off by the thing, the camp is eventually completely destroyed. The last thing attempts to escape using the spacecraft but is killed. We are then treated to a sequence during the end credits setting up the original movie.I really enjoyed the first 45 minutes of this movie. While a bit rushed, it felt very much in the spirit of the original. But as soon as the CGI started rearing it's ugly head, the movie lost me. All the tension evaporated and it quickly devolved into a more basic 'chased by a monster' movie. Part of the problem is the thing is not supposed to be out in the open, chasing people like an angry dog. The worst part of the third act is the creature being reduced to a lumbering CGI animal. And on the subject of CGI, it's horrible and inexcusable. Given the incredible practical effects of the original, this is a punch to the gut for fans. Much of the bad CGI could have been done better with practical effects but Hollywood prefers taking the easy way with these kinds of effects.Another problem is the cast. It's not that the acting is bad, as it works well enough. But there's just too many characters and we never get to know most of them. One of the strengths of the original was the use of a small cast in an isolated area to build tension. Did we know all of their life stories? No. But they were all able to speak often enough for us to care about them. When the team in this movie is getting picked off, I struggled to remember their names and usually didn't care when I couldn't figure it out. There are also a number of continuity errors between this movie and the original, which is another insult to fans. If your script does not match up perfectly to the original source material you are preceding, rewrite your damn script!In the end, The Thing feels like a missed opportunity. I personally believe that if they had used little to no CGI and had a stronger third act (save for the setup of the original) that this movie could have been very good. Instead, it's just a mediocre retread of the original. Score: 4/10",The Thing
274,NonSequiturL,A pale imitation of Carpenter's masterpiece,5,12 October 2011,"Let me preface this review with two things: first, I apologize for the pun/cliché in the title; second, I'm a major fan of John Carpenter's 1982 effort. I've watched it countless times and always cite it as my favorite film. With that in mind, I approached this remake/prequel with great caution.To get the good stuff out of the way, I have to praise the filmmakers for keeping very close to John Carpenter's style. The lingering shots of cold, mysterious hallways while atmospheric synth music plays notes of dread are present and accounted for. The creature transformations are interesting and despite being computer generated, are generally well executed. The script is cleverly written, hitting all the notes needed to work as a prequel as well as a story that will work for new audiences.All around, the film is entertaining brain candy. There's lots of action, creature effects and explosions to ensure you won't be bored. Its faithfulness to the style of its predecessor and its willingness to please fans and audiences are why I'm giving this film a 5 instead of something much lower.But that's where the good stuff ends.The effectiveness of The Thing's story relies on its mysteries, and our fear of the unknown. What happened at the Norwegian base has been a subject of debate amongst fans for many years, and finally someone has gone and ruined that debate. That's the central problem with the movie—it's a story that never needed to be told, and in telling it, the mythos becomes damaged. At least we still don't know what happened to Macready and Childs! At the risk of sounding sexist, I'll state outright that casting a young woman as the main protagonist was a major mistake. The 1982 film was unique in that the cast was populated by a bunch of grizzled, old character actors. By including women, we lose a lot of the subtext afforded by the all male cast in Carpenter's version. Also, the film asks us to stretch our disbelief by wanting us to accept a group of Norwegians—already reluctant to bring anyone else in on their discovery—are willing to bring in a young American woman to help. Opening up the story outside of Antartica at its very beginning also brings us away from the sense of isolation so thick in the 1982 film.While I said earlier that the creature transformations are interesting and fun to watch, they still don't hold a candle to the amazing practical effects and prosthetics created by Rob Bottin almost thirty years ago. As the runtime wears on, it sadly devolves into another ""kick-ass chick brandishing a flame thrower being stalked down dark corridors by a computer-generated creature"" movie, and that's not what The Thing was ever about. Where Carpenter's film was subtle, this one is loud and obnoxious, and I'm not trying to say that Carpenter's version was ever a hugely subtle movie.The film rolls along at a steady pace of hitting every single beat found in the 1982 version. There's not enough here to make it an original entry in a franchise, as it substitutes slightly different ideas for ones better executed by Carpenter. It's a bizarre beast, one that looks new, acts as some kind of prequel but in reality is a thinly veiled remake.It's ironic that Carpenter's The Thing, a movie about an imitating creature was itself imitated, even down to the studio's refusal to change the title. The film is at its best when emulating Carpenter's style, and the scenes over the credits put a smile on my face. Thankfully, the movie itself is respectful enough of the 1982 classic, and you can tell the filmmakers really tried their hardest to please everyone. It's just a shame that it's a story that never needed to be told.",The Thing

Both had amazing body horror, both had an amazing cast and acting, and they both hold a special place. And it really feels like a faithful remake to the original.

Nothing to write home to.As predicted, early on in the film, the alien eventually breaks out (you can see the clip on IMDb) and I was really hoping we'd get into some eerie scenes of Clue and mayhem but it dragged on with bad acting and cliché ""bad scientist"" scenarios. And I couldn't stand having 70's mophead Olsen in the film, he was the worst.It's definitely a tribute, but nothing to scary about it. I wasn't on the edge of my seat like the first one and that bothered me. It was a near complete plot layout as the first one, only they swapped it with CGI. I felt I was watching the 80's version with George Lucas remastering it.Worst CGI: Helicopter scene when the alien reveals itself (took ten seconds, you see everything, and it's no longer scary for the rest of the film).Best CGI: The arms that turn into little aliens and start crawling all around. That really creeped me out. It wasn't scary overall. I think the creepiest thing about it was the screams and sounds it made. Winstead didn't really drive the movie either. I preferred the burly bearded guys who spoke Norway and carried guns and flame throwers. I wanted the female to die off due to her acting. Cute yes, but this is a John Carpenter remake - there should be no women in the ice. The Lars character is solid, as is Jonas (who are played by Langhelle and Hivju).The last scene when the credits are rolling, I liked the big tribute to continue the story. It definitely stopped me from giving this a four.Five otta ten. For bad CGI, acting and tributes to the original.Highly recommend this to: People who can wait for the cheap seats or DVD.",The Thing
277,hallmitchell,Get your wild thing on. This is actually good!,7,10 October 2011,"I'm in shock right now. The Thing is actually a good movie and not some grab for cash rubbish.The prequel to the John Carpenter directed The Thing (released in 1982) packs a frost bitten punch.A Norwegian team uncovers a spaceship in the ice. A frozen ""something"" is found a few hundred metres from the spaceship.They cut it out and bring it back to base.That's when the mayhem starts.This movie is scary, well directed, well acted and a very worthy prequel to the 1982 sci-fi horror classic.The CGI is red hot. A no stage does anything look pix-elated or flat, this is flesh and bone real.A good The Thing movie will have heavy paranoia.This is movie is as paranoid as a drug courier going through Bangkok Airport.This movie is such a relief to see as anything with The Thing tag on it has to live up to high expectations from a small yet committed fan base.A very strong recommend in a flat time of year for films.",The Thing
278,neji107,"Impressive by Hollywood standards, but can't sustain the same classic suspense as the original",7,13 October 2011,"What really made John Carpenter's The Thing so magical was not its sci- fi elements, its alien movie aspects or even, I daresay, its splendid 1980s animatronic gore. It was the psychological tension! The issue of trust was a horrifying prospect: Who can you trust? Are you who you say you are? How can I tell what you say is the truth? At any moment, someone could be an alien waiting for the opportune moment to burst out and consume the vulnerable person. As a prequel to John Carpenter's work, The Thing (2011) taps respectfully into this raw suspense from the start, but towards the end loses its direction and falls victim to the Hollywood clichés of a typical alien monster film. The Thing prequel (for simplicity I'll call the 1982 film ""John Carpenter's"") covers what happened in the Norwegian base. Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited cautiously by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) to aid in an Antarctic dig of a great scientific discovery: an alien specimen found frozen in the ice near its ship. With the help of Norwegian scientists, they recover the body to the safety of the base, but soon learn that it is still alive and has the ability to assume the shape of that which it kills. The first half of the story follows how John Carpenter's film goes down almost exactly. (I won't say anything about how it fares against 1951 The Thing from Another World because I haven't seen it.) After the alien has proved to infect several humans already, extreme paranoia and distrust breaks out among the surviving crew. Kate quickly assumes the Kurt Russell-type leader, herding the survivors into open areas and investigating methods of exposing the monster. Tensions run extremely high, as they did in John Carpenter's, and at these moments I felt The Thing prequel had a good thing going for it. The suspense was thrilling and engaging, and aliens were bursting out of bodies at wholly unexpected times. The acting was consistently solid; Winstead did her part well, and the use of authentic Scandinavian actors was an added bonus. Within thirty minutes the film had paid enough homage to the original to be a worthy predecessor – more than I expected it to do in the first place -- but then it decided to take its own stylistic turn, which most would consider to be fine but Carpenter fans not so much.First, the age of animatronics is over. It's realistic to expect the effects in every Hollywood movie these days to rely on CGI, The Thing (2011) being no exception. So while it lacked that creepy gooey tangible feel of John Carpenter's animatronics, The Thing prequel had plenty of fast- paced alien sequences while still looking fairly good. The monster design stays pretty faithful, including wiry tentacles and frighteningly random mouths. Of course at this point though, these kind of CGI effects are nothing we haven't seen before; many times it seemed to be a zombie-type monster rather than Carpenter's amorphous alien, and in that sense was a bit unbelievable. Second, the movie switched tone halfway from primarily a psychological thriller to an alien, sci-fi flick. Whilst in Carpenter's film the alien tended only to burst out into its true form necessarily when discovered, in The Thing prequel it is glorified with an ungodly amount of screen time. The film quickly loses its intensity as it dwindles away into an ordinary monster chase around the Norwegian base. By measures of any typical Hollywood monster horror film, The Thing is still an engaging and impressive ride. But trying to continue in the same spirit as John Carpenter's, the film fails to sustain the classic psychological suspense it starts out with. 7.5/10",The Thing
279,The_creator2010,Mediocre...in terms of a so called prequel,5,21 May 2012,"The Thing...not John Carpenters cult classic, but an apparent prequel to the original. Let's face it, last year when myself, as well as most heard of a new release of the Thing? automatically I thought, okay, another horror remake. Horror remakes, or any remake if you like have an awful habit of staying a float in the sink for a good hour or so before quickly releasing the plug as we watch, happily, as it flows down the drain! It surprised me a couple of days ago before seeing the movie that they had set it out to be a prequel to the first. That was the reason I decided to push myself into seeing it without having to judge it based on John Carpenter's version.Kate Llode (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a graduate student who finds herself tagged along side Dr Sander Halvorson, who's played by Ulrich Thomsen. The two, also accompanied by a group of scientists and pilots are held together at an Antarctica Research facility.It becomes clear that Dr Sanders is after something not yet known to the rest of the crew. The movie lifts off after they discover the alien life form frozen in one giant ice cube! The find quickly lights up the eyes of Sanders as he sees this as a great discovery that could get his name down in history. Himself and the scientist pitch an idea of moving the alien from outside into a Lab inside were they can run some tests and try discover what it is they are dealing with.Kate, who seems paranoid over the idea of running tests on the alien creature quickly makes it known to Sanders about her feelings and safety. We get introduced to Carter (Joel Edgerton) a pilot for the facility. Kate turns to Carter after failing talks with Sanders regarding of his plans. According to Dr Sanders, they have made the discovery of a life time as he fails to understand why Kate is blind to that.A good half hour into the movie was all it took for the ""Thing"" to be left alone. The crew had left it out back, still in the ice cube. I am guessing to let the ice melt? Then Boom! the Thing is released and goes on a rampage. The idea of it's agility to kill and transform by embracing human cells is quality. It was nice to see it keep the same isolated scene...kind of like in Alien? Were in space it said no one can here you scream? yeah, kind of along the lines of that. But not as amazing...obviously. The idea of any group of people being picked off one by one by anything always makes for an entertaining movie.The CGI in the Thing, was in fact diabolical. There was one part, without saying, that was pretty decent, but the rest was hideous. In modern day effects in movies, especially one that's supposed to involve a gruesome looking alien? they should have done miles better with the look of the Thing,considering the detailed attempt in 82"". I did not want to rub off the original too much, although I might have had already, but the director labelled this a prequel? A lot of what you see in this is exactly what you will find in the 1982 version.As for characters, there is no one in this movie that you grow to like, or even dislike. They are all quite anonymous. Joel Edgerton, who is clearly supposed to be the equivalent to Kurt Russel's character just never takes off. It is fair to say Joel is the best actor in the movie, but in fairness most of the characters never got a look in. My point is there was never a character in the movie you find yourself rooting for. Maybe the Thing? but that's it.Overall the movie stuck to some important spectacles of the original. The chilling base isolated in the middle of the Antarctica definitely succeeded in adding horror to the movie. I was delighted to still hear the creepy tune that plays through-out the movie. There were scenes I did find myself jumping to, to be honest. The cinema can do that to you sometimes! So fans of the 1982 classic might find this movie hard to avoid. I would advise them to see it to judge themselves. The Thing is also for any horror fans just looking for a good scare mixed with the entertainment of watching humans get splattered! This was in no way a bad movie, but unfortunately fails to be anything other than mediocre.I believe, if this was meant as a prequel? it should have been giving a title, with a title. So instead it is just the Thing? just like, the Thing in 1982. But hey, don't be fooled...apparently it isn't a remake.A horror movie that is worth a watch, but don't expect to remember it after the next movie you go on to see.Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/",The Thing
280,CathodeRayTubesRock,"Good, but not that good prequel",6,29 July 2017,"The 2011 version is pretty good (solid 6.5/10) horror/sci-fi. Really the main problem that it suffers from is what a lot of horror/sci-fi films suffer from lack of tension and repetition.Tension: Hey, I get it, it is difficult to pull off a really good film. In particular, creating tension is hard to do. It involves good acting and a delicate touch. In this movie the producers try to force tension with the cliché of a monster roaring for long enough to allow the hero to do something. Repetition: If you're going to make a sequel rather than a remake, you cannot use the same tropes from the earlier film. For example, when a flame-thrower mysteriously malfunctions at a critical moment.Using one character as the 'hero': Spread the love a little. Have characters be a little more complicated like real people. In this case, Kate is obviously the hero. She does pretty much everything good in the film. She makes all the right decisions. Heroes are more interesting if they are human. This was a great time for people to talk about things and make an informed decision. Let them talk and discuss some different points of view. Should we do this or should we do that. I don't mean to be overly critical. The movie is okay. It's just that it doesn't bring anything new or particularly interesting.",The Thing

It's a prequel.The story is pretty much the same as the original one, except the alien-UFO part is getting explained more.The acting is good, there are a few familiar faces in the movie.The CGI is not that great, but they used practical effects too. The alien scenes are scary, so I wouldn't complain about that.I see the movie didn't even earn back it's budget. Well, I would blame the title and the rumor that it's a remake. The title should be ""The Thing awakens"" or something like that. Or ""The Thing 2"". Or anything but ""The Thing"". It's confusing and it makes people believe that it's just a copy-paste of the '80-s movie.I think it would rate this movie a 6.5 / 10. Not perfect at all, but a little bit better than average. Definitely worth watching at least once.",The Thing
282,esstee55,This is NOT yet another remake OR re-telling of the classic story!,8,2 December 2012,"Why are so many reviewers here so ignorant? This is not yet another remake, this is, well, sort of a prequel to John Carpenter's classic 1982 remake of The Thing From Another World, from 1951. Anyone who's seen Carpenter's remake more than once must remember that, early in that film, two of the characters go to a Norwegian camp by helicopter, and witness some horrific things that had already happened to those people. And that was it. This film, the makers of which had enormous respect for Carpenter's version and didn't want to insult it in any way, decided to let us see just what the hell happened to those Norwegians before the two characters from Carpenter's version got there. That, in a nutshell, is what this movie is. I admit that I initially had a problem with the title of this; couldn't they have come up with a better title? Calling it The Thing suggests that this is indeed a remake of Carpenter's film. But it's not, I assure you. I mean, about the best title I could come up with was The Thing Before The Thing. But that's no good. Anyway, anyone who loves the Carpenter version should see this, for sure.",The Thing
283,luke5119,Give It a Chance,8,5 December 2011,"This is by far one the better remake/prequel films I've seen over the past 7 years or so. When it comes to following the steps of the great John Carpenter, the team that worked on this film did far better than Rob Zombie did with Halloween. Who in my opinion has no business making films. One thing you have to do is clear your mind entering this film. Admire the original, but be open to the remake. Too many people get fixated on the ""original"" aspect and give remakes no chance whatsoever, even when the remake is solid. In this case it is, a very solid remake/prequel. There are some errors and plot issues, but that's to be expected, and they weren't major flaws. Which is good. One of the few errors I noticed in this film was with the dig site for the alien creature. In the 1982 film when the American team finds it, the entire top of the alien ship is exposed, but embedded deep within the glacial surface. In this film the ship is buried, and a network of man made caves lead to the ship. The 1982 film shows archive footage of the Norwegians blowing up the ice surface to get to the ship. In the 2011 film, the Norwegians never do that. So that just shows you, the little changes like that don't really hinder the story. All in all it's a good film, it follows the original a little too much on how it plays out, but it's not bad. I loved the ending credits. Which played out exactly how I wanted them to be. With one surviving Norwegian, and a rescue pilot arriving, then chasing the infected dog to the American base camp, which in turn is the start of the 1982 version. They combined film footage for the final scene, but it looks flawless. A great movie, and a must watch for any die hard John Carp fan :)",The Thing
284,fionagreen1,Something's not right here.,6,17 December 2011,"Despite the average rating above, this movie was a crippling disappointment for me, as seems to be the case for most fans of the '82 version. It's all been said before, though, so I'm really just lending my opinion to the weight of all the others who've reviewed this version.It's fair to say that the story was always going to be on rails, due to Carpenter's version and the need to align both tales, but even still the 2011 movie is a clear retreading of the classic that went before it, offering little in the way of distinction.This lack of imagination extends also to an absence of directorial common sense, in that (as others have pointed out) the thing manages to burst through its victims and perfectly re cloth them afterwards so that they appear unmolested, yet cannot duplicate inorganic materials such as teeth fillings. It's this type of silly oversight, so typical of hollowood films, that jars the viewer from the experience. That and the unlikeliness of an advanced organism (biologically at least, perhaps technologically if the spaceship is its own) leaving its safe and OPERABLE transport to freeze in the Antarctic wastes.Aside from these glaring mistakes, we also have a dreadful CGI creation to contend with, which, ironically, was bettered 28 years ago with animatronics! When are these cash-hungry, dumb hollowood directors going to opt for realism over computer game imagery? One reviewer likened the 2011 thing to a Resident Evil monstrosity, something I wholeheartedly agree with.The mood, too, is significantly less tense in the 2011 version, although there are moments which strive to reach the intensely paranoid vibe that set Carpenter's Thing apart from so many other alien movies. Of these, the most effective is probably the 'test', which took a fair amount of flak for aping 82's Thing, despite the high probability of this type of action taking place at the onset of dealing with a shape-shifter.A fair amount of criticism has been directed toward the inconspicuousness of the alien, as compared to the shifty, covert movements of Carpenter's beast, and while I agree that this is one of the main reasons for such a lack of tension in this film, it may also be explained by the creature's inexperience with humans, initially.Although I've flayed the more recent movie for having poor effects, a lack of imagination and some criminally short-sighted plot-holes, I nevertheless enjoyed it overall as a standard sci-fi/horror hybrid. The sense of isolation in a hostile environment was ever present, and there were some nice plot devices, along with a fairly unpredictable game of who's The Thing for the viewers to engage in. The effects, albeit far too glossy, were still horrific and shocking even if they never reached the gut-wrenching alien-ness of the '82 classic.I had no problem at all with the female lead, although her unaccountability in the Carpenter film did lead to an unsatisfyingly vague 'explanation' at the end.In general, the acting, while not outstanding, was suitable enough to carry the movie from one bloodbath to another, without many ridiculous lines of dialogue, although those reviewers highlighting the lack of character arcs are spot-on in their analyses. Mind you, what kind of character growth can we expect from a situation which provokes either outright terror or fierce survivalist determination over a short time period? The segmenting of the two movies ('82 and 2011) would've been effective had the director chosen not to insert credits throughout, which are perhaps the most distancing aspect of any movie for a viewer. They did, at least, tick off all the other boxes regarding the consistency of both versions.As an afterthought, though, it'll be interesting to watch the '82 Thing again just to see whether the inorganic material is present in any of the absorbed characters.Overall, a massive disappointment in comparison to the version that preceded it, but still a reasonable popcorn sci-fi/horror gore-session if that strange mix happens to be your bag.It could've been so much more, rather than just someTHING.",The Thing

The movie contains some horrifying cadres and quite an original plot. I would even consider it a classic in a sense that it was tightly packed, not rushed - it will be good to watch 30 years from now, just like the sequel. The best part of a movie, especially of an horror movie, are the parts where normal life is displayed before everything goes haywire. The moments, when initial surprise is displayed by people who witness the turning events or realize the things won't go on as normally as they have before, are the most enjoyable.

286,nathanhmcdonald,A really good movie ''Rare for Hollywood these days'',9,14 October 2011,"To be blunt, at least 70% of the new movies I see from Hollywood today are either total crap or only mildly entertaining. The Thing 2011 is a breath of fresh air from the normal dredge that is modern Hollywood productions.Now being a HUGE fan of John Carpenters 1982 The Thing, I was hugely skeptical about this new prequel. My skepticism was soon put to rest though. This movie follows the events that take place at the Norwegian camp only a couple of days before the events that take place at the American research outpost in which the 1982 The Thing took place. This new movie follows Kate Lloyd a young paleontologist who is asked to come do research on a new finding in Anartica.I won't spoil much about the movie for you...But I will say this, I only found two things to nit-pick about it.#1 - Was the CGI...Yes CGI was expected as its all Hollywood uses for their effects anymore. But it was something about those gooey grotesque looking animatronics from the 1982 film that really gave a sense of horror. Sometimes in this move the CGI effects are a little more noticeable than they should be, but for the most part quick camera work during these action sequence's keep it from being to obvious.#2 - The Things behavior...In the 1982 film, The Thing only came out of hiding when it had no other choice. For the most part it seemed to want to be left alone so it could quietly and methodically take over every human at the American camp in private...The Thing portrayed in the new movie is very aggressive, It seems less afraid to show itself publicly and often times attacks people in situations where the old monster would never have come out.Overall this is a good movie, a rarity amongst what I've become accustomed to from Hollywood these days. I plan to own this one when goes out on DVD. If you're a fan of the 1982 The Thing, this is worth a watch...There will be some things about it that will probably bug you, but you should find it overall interesting and worth a movie ticket price.",The Thing

Although this version is being compared to the 1982 version directed by John Carpentar; The 1982 film was actually a remake of the original movie from 1951, so this version is a remake of a remake and this version I can truthfully say was not done any better than John Carpentars but still an OK version. The 1982 version I will say overall was or is the best of the three to own or watch and if you have never seen any versions you will enjoy them all.

289,ed_zeppelin,Buuuuuurrrrrrrrn it!,4,10 December 2011,"I have a general rule of thumb when reviewing films like this, which is to try to judge them on their own merits and not to compare them too much with the original.* The main reason for this is that I like to think of myself as a serious critic and nothing screams ""whining reactionary fanboy"" like fixating on nostalgia. But I'm going to have to break my own rule just this once, because this film does so many things wrong and John Carpenter's film provides a perfect counterexample to illustrate the point.I should just say that I in no way consider the original to be a particularly deep or sophisticated film. There's nothing revolutionary about its ""alien kills an isolated group of people one at a time"" plot and it doesn't use its graphic body-horror imagery to explore any particular theme. What it does do is present a very efficient narrative, with virtually perfect pacing and structure, in which a group of clearly-defined individual characters band together and fall apart as their numbers grow ever fewer. The 2011 prequel film presents a group of generic nonentities and one character whom the film relies on so heavily to deliver all the exposition that she may as well be clairvoyant.It turns out that characterisation is all important in a film like this. What I didn't appreciate until right now is that the smaller cast in the original wasn't just down to the limits of early-80s special effects budgets; it's because, if the audience doesn't know who each individual is, then the entire paranoia-based plot line doesn't work. It's something both films attempt to present: characters set up alliances with some people and oppositions to others, which then develop into expressions of power and dominance based on who's got access to the flamethrowers. The viewer is encouraged to go along with this by joining in the speculation over who's the monster and who isn't; that fell totally flat in the 2011 film because I didn't know who anyone was anyway. People were standing in rooms arguing and I couldn't remember if they'd even been on screen up to that point - the film just asked me to remember too many faces and too many names, without offering enough recognisable personalities to go along with them. At one point the monster causes two characters to literally merge together into one body, and I like to think that was the CGI team making an ironic comment on the scripting. Yes, that's the origin of the ""two-headed monster"" remains we see at the beginning of the '82 film; we get to see who came to be that monster. Spoiler: a pair of nobodies.Not that it matters much, because no paranoia-based scene lasts more than a minute in the prequel before the monster suicidally reveals itself in front of everyone for no reason whatsoever. Thirty years of special-effects development allow heads and bodies to split and distort left and right, and my word, doesn't the monster just love showing off now? It also moves much faster than it does in the '82 film and frankly it needs the athletic advantage, because it sure as hell isn't going to outsmart anybody in this film. Apparently it gains several IQ points in between the prequel and the original because its low cunning in the Carpenter film is nowhere to be found here; instead of revealing itself just when alone, or cornered, or attacked, here it reveals itself whenever...er, I don't know, actually. There doesn't seem to be much reason to it, but then it has been thirty years so perhaps it's just pleased to be working again. But because it's so hard to keep track of the characters, and because none of them are developed, killing them off doesn't really make much of a difference to the film. In the original, not only could we care about the characters who were getting picked off, but each death also drove the narrative forward because it was easy to measure how many survivors were left. In other words, the special effects actively served the story because the death scenes that followed them acted as a kind of countdown clock, raising the tension as the film moved towards its conclusion. All that goes out the window in the prequel, which means that the whole thing works the other way round: the deaths, the story, the characters all serve the special effects.That tail-wagging-the-dog argument is so commonly levelled against modern cinema now that it's become a cliché to state it, but it's true. Characters don't die so that they can move the story forward; the story moves forward so that characters can die in effects sequences. And really, that's the problem with the film. There is a nice addition to the Thing mythology (the monster can't absorb inorganic material, so you can tell who's human by whether they've still got fillings in their teeth, or earrings and suchlike) but the odd clever idea like that isn't going to save a film like this. Neither this nor the original are particularly deep or thematically rich; like I said at the beginning, the original was good because it had a pared-down and efficient narrative, not because it had anything profound to say about the human condition. The prequel doesn't manage either; it's flabby, unengaging and - contrary to the claims of its director - pays only lip service to the notion that stories should be about people first and icky monsters second.* For the purposes of this review I'm referring to the 1982 film as ""the original""; I know there was an earlier adaptation, but it's the '82 film that this film shares its universe with.",The Thing

There are those which are for this version, and those who are against it.The Thing 2011 (despite its confusing title) is a prequel and is both faithful and respectful of the 82 remake. It tells the story of the Norwegian base camp, as discovered at the beginning of The Thing 82. It does not try to revamp, or steal any of the origin movies mythology.The only thing to point out is the sad loss of puppetry. This new edition is a bit of a special effects fest, at times it felt like watching a Resident Evil movie (Except a really good one.) The pace is good, the acting is good, the story is good, the special effects are awesome (though i would have preferred make-up and puppets) its an allrounder.The director knew he could not make a better film than the 82 version, but what he has produced is a good horror film that respects and adds to the mythology of John Carpenters ""The Thing.""

295,Crackhouse2,"An above par standalone film, a patchy prequel",8,24 November 2011,"**May contain spoiler** I'll start by saying i really enjoyed this prequel, i am a fan of prequels and in some stories it can offer unique back stories. I can't help but agree with one of the other reviews i read saying that some things just didn't tie in quite as well as it could have. The prime reason behind this was the original started with 2 Norwegians chasing the dog in a chopper. Immediately you notice in the film that there is only one chopper which gets destroyed, only one person who spoke only Norwegian, seeing as the confusion encountered at the start of the original seeing as no one else spoke Norwegian and couldn't reason with them as they didn't understand English; this was compounded as only the American woman survived, they then tried to get around this by playing a chopper sound over the credits, who is flying? if they're new on the ground how do they grasp the gravity of how this thing complete replicates its victim? how do they know the dog has been replicated if it hasn't shown itself? Despite all this, the film stands well on its own and even throughout, you do feel it feeds into the plot of the first quite well, just some gaps. It is very much a typical American rethinking in a lot of respects. None of the suspense was as prolonged as in the John Carpenter original but still with that in mind, i wouldn't say this was a travesty that all Carpenter fans should avoid. Give it a watch, if you enjoyed the first, this won't disappoint you",The Thing
296,stjohn1253,Worthwhile Back Story,8,27 April 2015,"Did this film entertain? Yes. Did it have high production values? Yes. Did the players act convincingly? Yes. Did monsters seem monstrous? Yes. Did it fail at the impossible task of delivering suspense to an audience already aware of the nature of the Thing? Yes...and therein lies the rub.If the audience abandons expectations of genuine terror, the film succeeds quite well; however, if it harbors the unreasonable anticipation of equal or more fright than Carpenter's version, it simply fails.Just about every prequel guarantees lesser viewer satisfaction than the original by virtue of the fact that teller has already told the tale. This film provides a workmanlike back story to the outstanding original, and because of that, it merits watching.",The Thing
297,jkling-1,"A really enjoyable movie, despite some small plot flaws. SPOILERS",8,5 November 2011,"Yes there will be some SPOILERS here - so if you don't want them the please stop now.I've been a huge fan of the original since it came out. I only found out a few days ago that the new one was actually a prequel. And that got me excited, to see how that would play out.First, the arctic scenery was incredible. Just stunning. It was very easy to believe that you had this small group of people in the middle of nowhere and that isolation would be put to work.Aside from a few relatively minor points, I was quite pleased with how they pulled it all off. This review might look like it's mostly critical but I had a really good time watching this movie.I for one was not put off by the initial attack by the creature. Bear in mind that until that moment, the creature didn't ""know"" that it was up against an intelligent species with tools, guns, flame throwers, etc. All it knew is that it woke up from a LONG sleep, and was presumably pretty hungry and feels like a cornered animal ... So to me it makes sense that it's initial attack was more overt and aggressive. It sure learned quickly that it's next moves needed to be more subtle.I was NOT impressed with how they had the creature burst out of the ice block. That broke my suspension of disbelief. There's just no way that the creature would have had the leverage to pull that off. And so they missed out on finding a better way to do it.The other thing that disappointed me was that, just as soon as they established that ""hey ... one or more of us might not actually be human anymore ... "". Creepy right? And there are only 7 of them at that point. So what's the very next thing that they did? That's right - they split up into multiple tiny groups (at least 2 of these groups were only 2 people teams) - and went off to do different things, before then coming back together again. Are you freak'n kidding me?! Even IF there had been only ONE imitated human at that point, there sure as heck was going to be 2 (or more) - as they made sure that someone was going to be perfectly vulnerable while waiting for that test to be developed, and the surviving people to regroup.Me? I'm thinking that EVERYONE needs to stay in one group from that point forward, until circumstances FORCE splits to happen. And they did a very nice job of that later on.SIGH. But OK I'm not going to focus on that since they were TRYING to bring up the anxiety level and growing distrust among the group. And for a while they did a really nice job of that. It would have been nice if they kept it up for longer.Anyway - see the movie and enjoy it for what it is! I'm looking forward to them making ANOTHER thing!",The Thing

299,shmucking,Thoroughly entertaining with some very good performances,9,15 December 2012,"Much better than I expected, and a worthy follow-up to the '82 classic. Some observations: Eric Christian Olsen, who plays the assistant Adam Finch, is very funny in some of his reactions. When he says ""what are you, some kind of a**hole?"" and ""so I'm guilty because I floss?"" he adds some much-needed humor to the movie. Too bad he isn't in more of the film. At the beginning, I assumed he'd be the second-main character next to Mary Elizabeth Winstead.Ulrich Thomsen, as Dr. Sander Halvorson, is also very impressive as the somewhat condescending scientist, he seems genuinely serious about the science aspects of the monster and adds some Max Von Sydow-like old-school authority.Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a subtle kind of eye-rolling sarcasm in some of her scenes that make her character seem more human and unique than the typical boring heroine role.Kim Bubbs, as Juliette, has a great scene where she cries for one of the victims. That was one of the problems I had with the '82 version where no one seemed sad when someone died.Very entertaining movie with a child-like enthusiasm for the scariness of the monster and a surprisingly intelligent and measured sense of pacing.",The Thing
300,Skynet-TX,The Thing: Begins,2,14 December 2011,"The Thing prequel is a pretty good movie. IF. If we forgot about the fact that it supposed to be a prequel of the Carpenter version of ""The Thing from another world"" from 1951. In the original movie we can see seven Norwegians to place thermits into the ice to blow it down from the top of the spacecraft. Later, when McReady goes to the spot we can see the ship in a huge crater covered with fresh snow. In this movie there's more a dozen Norwegians and they dig a tunnel into the ice. When the Thing gets back to the ship and starts it again the ice above it breaks into peaces. At the end we can see Kate finding out that her friend is a Thing and killing him. There's a cut and we can see a helicopter arriving to the camp, a Norwegians who survived somehow, and a dog-imitation to break out. My questions are: What happened to Kate? Where did she go? How did that guy survive? How many dogs were there in the camp? What happened to the others? (We can see one in the beginning being killed and the imitation at the end.) Is Kate a scientist or an amazon? (Scientist don't used to be amazons and vice versa.) The girls are really pretty in this movie but we do not watch these kind of films to see pretty girls. In the original movie humans become an imitation when they are alone for a longer period of time. In this movie hardly anyone is alone for even five minutes but many turns out to be a Thing. To copy a being cell-by-cell is a long process. And at last: the were no flat screen monitors with realistic graphics in 1982. So, if you haven't seen the original movie of Carpenter you may like this one, but if you liked that film, don't watch this. More than once.",The Thing

The director has been very meticulous in adhering to the vibe of the 1982 film, the continuity and attention to detail is excellent.I really did believe this was set in 1982. Special effects were very good, I was initially worried this would be a CGI fest, but I was pleasantly surprised. The characters were quite good, with everything tallying up towards the end to fit in with the sequel. There were quite a few tense scenes,and the music was atmospheric and complimented what was on the screen. The only down side was the film had many moments that mimicked its predecessor. If this movie was a stand alone movie, I would have given this 10 stars, but because it borrows many tropes and situations from the 1982 movie, it loses a couple of points. Never the less I highly recommend this movie, for fans and newbies alike.8 out of 10.",The Thing
307,TheSonomaDude,"Could've been better, but I was overall satisfied.",4,23 November 2011,"Well, I haven't had the time to write an IMDb movie review for a long time, so now that I finally had the chance, I said ""why not?"". I am a HUGE fan of The Thing 1982, along with most of John Carpenters work. John Carpenters The Thing is, in my opinion, a 10/10, A+, 5 stars, large thumbs up, whatever. I think its one of the best horror films ever made. So I was quite excited to find out that a prequel was to be made. After several debates on the movie boards, Friday October 14th arrived and I saw The Thing in theaters opening day.I recently saw it again at my local dollar theater (it was completely empty...) and my opinions haven't changed much. I like it, I really do, but some things could've been improved:-the title. SO many people were convinced that this was a remake. I think they shouldve named it ""From Another World"", because if you place it with the Carpenter movie, you have ""The Thing"" and ""From Another World"".-CGI was overused. The Carpenter film is famous for having groundbreaking effects, but no CGI (it didn't exist in 1982). Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis are 2 great effect workers (they did Jurassic Park, Tremors, Aliens, Starship Troopers, and AVP), so I was eager to see their work; they advertised ""80% animatronics, 20% CGI"". Well, it was more like ""40% animatronics, 60% CGI."" Oh well. The effects were very good, for the most part. -they never use the Ennio Morricone theme. Well, they do, but its at the end credits for about 30 seconds before it switches to some other music. Morricone wrote a spine chilling musical score for the 1982 film. The main theme for the 1982 film is, I think, one of the best ever. So I was disappointed to only hear it once in this film.-what we see and what we don't. This tool was used extremely well in the 1982 film. Here, the paranoia factor seems to be minimized for the gore and transformation scenes. But even then, I think the gore could've been upped. The scene where the thing reveals itself on the helicopter could've been really gross and awesome, but we don't see any of it. Why?-its too damn rushed. The 1982 film had patients and was building up on the paranoia. In this one, as soon as the Thing breaks loose, its like a 90 minute roller-coaster, which is both good and bad. Its good because its never boring, but its bad because it just seems to fastly paced and seems to be overwhelmed in itself.However, there are some good aspects. The acting is good, the effects range from ""meh"" to outstanding, the ending is brilliant, and the cinematography is really fabulous to look at. Overall, I think a 7/10 is a fair rating. Not as good as the Carpenter film, but its still better than...most horror films from this year.",The Thing
308,danhollow,Perfection.,10,23 October 2011,"Some introduction: I saw John Carpenter's The Thing approximately a year ago when a film buff friend of mine showed it to me, I loved all of it. The mystery, the amazing special effects, the brilliant way it kept you guessing, everything was perfect. I even talked with him when he said the crew had fought tooth and nail to ensure a sequel was never made, I agreed that such a film couldn't be made. Later that year, I analyzed the original screenplay for The Thing for 7 hours for my writing class, writing down every possibility for everything (it was exhausting).When I heard of this prequel, I cringed. When I heard it was a prequel, I sort of half-cringed (part of me was interested to see a cast that would by necessity be at least half-Norwegian). When I heard Mary Elizabeth Winstead would star, I cringed (no offense to her, but I didn't think she could ever compare to Kurt Russell). And with Stan Winston's passing, more of my hopes died for this film.I have never been so happy to be so wrong. This film was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Beautiful, breathtaking, disturbing, terrifying, amazing.Everything that the film needed to match up with John Carpenter's movie was there, and done magnificently. You can tell how much work and effort they put into everything. The locations. Beautiful icy wastelands, not sets. The establishing shots are stunning to look at.The characters. Yes, more than half the cast is Norwegian, and they all do a great job. There are Americans characters as well, and most of the Norwegians speak English (with one important exception), there are more characters than in the first one, but that's one of the best parts of this film.It takes great efforts to replicate John Carpenter's The Thing, but also to be its own version of the story. Many scenes are replicated here, but they are done their own way. They don't simply re-hash every scene from the original, they add in new scenes and new territory to be explored.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is still not MacReady, but she doesn't try to be. She's more like Ripley from Alien, but with a flamethrower this time.The screenplay and suspense. Half of the greatness of The Thing was how impossible it was to tell who was human and who wasn't at any given moment. That continues here as well. They encounter some of the same obstacles and even come up with some of their own solutions to determining who is who and who is what.The Thing itself. While they use computer-generated monster effects this time, they still use a lot of animatronics and freaky costumes to ensure the Thing remains as disturbingly terrifying as ever. This time, we actually get to see some of it moving around and stalking prey, not just hiding in a human meat suit and waiting until you're alone. Some familiar moments and forms are present, but they also do a whole lot of new transformations which are excellent to watch.The continuity. Does everything match up with what we knew from the original? Yes. Everything. Down to the half-formed two-headed Thing frozen in the ice and the red axe buried in the wall and left there. All in all, it was perfection. A superior remake and a superior prequel. 10 stars.",The Thing

Amidst an ocean of horror sequels, prequels, and remakes, I say it from the top of a mountain that this is one of the best if not the best horror prequel/remake that Hollywood has produced so far, "" it is one of the better efforts, considerably stronger than Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Hitcher, The Last House On The Left and Rupert Wainwright's god awful remake of Carpenter's The Fog"" says Jamie Graham of Total Film review. This movies has a very good cast, a tight script, great direction by Dutch first-time director Matthijs van Heijningen, and super CG effects that really impress more than repel and a truly loyal and tribute-like to the gory effects and splatter imagination that were present in the original motion picture that were beautifully executed by Rob Bottin. The only thing this movie lacked was a sense of suspense, clearly evident in Carpenter's version is utter tension from the first scene of the helicopter chasing the dog, this one however just strolled right through the butter of the story and showed it like it is, the events of the story, the creatures, the pure horror kind could truly please any horror fan but surely it will distract the audience from the lack of suspense.If you're in for a horror night, this picture serves up a nice junky horror treat.

First time director, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., does a terrible job with giving The Thing that horror movie feel. The point of horror films is to scare your audience. The Thing has zero scares and is just a mess of visual effects. The script for this film is trash. If you're going to write a prequel, write an actual prequel! Give a back story to how the thing got there, don't just write new characters and throw in a spaceship. This is just garbage. The CGI in The Thing is hard to watch because it looks like you're watching Dead Space video game graphics. I really don't like how fake everything looks.The performances in The Thing are just as bad as the story, but what do you expect, right?

311,Moviemanic22,Old wine in a new bottle,6,1 February 2017,"'The Thing 2011' is the intended prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 movie of the same name. Despite many chances to see it, I have to admit I had never taken advantage of the opportunity. However It had come to my attention that this movie explains what happened before the arctic team had arrived to the snow station in the 82 version. Many fans of the original have stated that this movie doesn't live up to it's expectations. I may agree, but it doesn't mean to say that it isn't an enjoyable film. I would agree that it pales in comparison to it's predecessor. Though I still enjoyed it. Despite not seeing the original The film goes through the same motions. And there is an excessive use of cgi in the special effects department which was impressive. Very gory and bloody I might state. Not to say I have an issue with that. But it would have been fun to see some special effects that were not cgi. The film has some good pacing and performances were decent. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is quiet convincing. It was unfortunate that the characters were not developed enough so that we could empathise with them before they were killed off. The film doesn't have the same soul or atmosphere as the original. I couldn't feel the impending threat that was looming over them. Plus it wasn't explained at what moment any character was taken over by the alien. In general it is recommended to see if one has not seen the original. However I personally feel that this was only an excuse to update an old film for today's generation, because it had nothing new to offer.",The Thing
312,allypk2000,A perfect capture of explained events,8,10 December 2011,"The concept of this movie at first in my mind was of a re-make of John Carpenter movie ""The Thing"" which i believe, cannot be produced again as he is the best, but as the movie progressed, the events unfolded one by one, from the discovery of alien spaceship, to the discovery of the alien itself, has been really at first confusing, but then as the movie commences, it all becomes self explanatory and a perfect capturing of events from the first movie are unfolded which are really amazing by the storyline and timing. Quite frankly in this movie, none of the characters were strong as was ""McReady"" in the first movie, but certain storyline matches with the first movie, like the sequence in 2 headed monster discovery and the escape of doctor to the alien spaceship, appeared in both the movies. There should have been one strong character in the movie but as none of the characters are strong then this makes the movie a bit of interesting in the sense, who will be the last one left in the movie as all the characters die earlier in the movie. I think that its a viewer's choice how they rate this movie but i rate the movie 8/10 just because of the fact that the movie has something new and interesting and unexpected.

313,practicallypeach,"In a time of crisis, people just don't act this way",3,15 October 2011,"I've seen the original 'The Thing' more times than I can count and, ignoring the great story, stellar effects, and fantastic cliff hanger, one thing that makes that movie so great is its believability. This movie doesn't have that in so many different ways. Firstly, a Norwegian team finds an alien and its ship, and the first thing that they do is get, not 1 but 4, Americans involved in some way. Well you might think, ""Well maybe they needed an expert paleontologist and the best one was in America."" You mean to tell me that there are no Paleontologists in Norway to dig something up? It was even made clear fairly early on that her only job was to dig it up safely. Hardly any reason for one to look outside of ones own country for something like that. Why'd her friend go? Beats me. Why were the pilots American? Again, not a clue. The movie also makes one Norwegian's actions out to not make any sense. ""Let's take a sample."" ""...Why? It's not going anywhere."" ""Because! And don't contradict me again."" I would have actually preferred for there to have been a stupid reason for that than no reason. But there was no reason. That sample never came into play again. Let's talk about about human behavior. So someone comes up with a decent way to not find the monster but to at least find out who's human and you say ""No. It's stupid""? If you were in this situation and you could find out who's human through an easy painless test, wouldn't you? I know I'd be all for it. Even if I didn't pass, I'd be able to spot who to watch out for and the only thing I'd worry about is being locked away with the others who didn't pass, which COULD have been a cool dynamic to the movie. It would have given a reason for characters to fight quarantine. And if someone is adamantly trying to bring nationality into the sway (""I'm Norwegian like you! It's the Americans!"" As if that really matters in this case) they'd be the one I constantly kept my gun pointed at. That behavior in general just doesn't make sense, whether you're infected or not. If you're infected, you look like an obvious idiot pulling that card. If you're not infected, it's a stupid argument to make, period.Also (Yes, also) when it is fully established that people are being killed and copied, what's the next move? Split into two and separate. That way, while working on the blood test, if one of you turns out to be the monster, then the other can...well...And if you're out in the storm, looking for the monster and one or both of you turn out to be infected, then we can...um...Also this monster chooses the absolute WORST times to transform and can replicate clothing apparently. Oh and no one brushes in 1982 and everyone has fillings.And as a side note for myself, I'd be more interested in the spaceship. Not the organic life. Sure it's life but LOOK AT THIS SPACESHIP. LET'S LEARN MORE. I don't even know if they ever bothered to go inside once they discovered it until the end of the movie. Speaking of which, by the end of the movie, when the alien was trying to take off and leave, I'd say GOOD RIDDANCE! By all means, let it go! If it's off earth, it's not our issue anymore. So, in short, the movie 'might' be worth renting if you're in the mood for monsters. Other than that, save your money.",The Thing
314,matthewchermside,"Poor film, adds nothing to the original",3,5 January 2012,"Have to agree with many of the reviewers on this site, the effects are poor by today's CG standard and the original was far more scary and believable 30 years ago. It does try to be an interesting prequel but fails quite miserably - I actually lost interest in the last third of the film and couldn't wait for it to end.It started promisingly with some interesting characters but it quickly lost its impetus. What little suspense that is built up in the middle of the film is lost quickly as it turns into a CGI-monster stalking people through dark corridors. The ending also made little sense to me (loose ends with Lars still being alive and the female lead admitting to knowing that Edgerton's character wasn't human much earlier in the story?) and it tried to make up for it with a little sequence in the credits to point/nod towards John Carpenter's terrifying sci-fi classic - to which this film is a really pale shadow. I got the impression the scriptwriters/screenwriters just didn't know where to take this story and just hashed the last third together.Don't waste your time watching it. Watch Carpenter's film instead. Even if you've seen it a hundred times, it's much better than this.",The Thing
315,paytonprovo,A long awaited return to a classic.,8,21 December 2011,"First of all, like many other people I'm a huge fan of The original Thing. I was so excited to see the new one out in theaters. If you haven't heard the new Thing is a prequel that involves the Norwegians that are in the first film. So the movie starts of like any other movie, something has been found, now a researcher comes in. Kate(Winstead) is sent to check it out. Obviously domino chip hits a domino chip and the creature cocoons itself into somebody. That's were the problem comes in, the movie didn't have the suspense of the first film. The creature was predictable at some points,and the creature I have to say looked more stunning than ever. The creature was scary, just not how the creature was put into play. The original was a suspense horror and in my mind the second one was more a thriller action movie. It just didn't feel the same as the original, but my favorite aspect about the movie is the prequel part about it. After I watched this movie I watched the original to see if the events that happened were the same. All in all I'm giving it a 8 because I believe it was worth the money and it still had some elements from the original. A spoiler to everybody, once the credits start to roll don't leave.",The Thing
316,tnelson2-374-411051,Not perfect but respects the source material and is very entertaining,8,10 May 2020,"First off I want to start by saying I'm a huge fan of the 1982 original film, and regard it very highly, among the top 5 horror films ever made, so I was skeptical about this prequel/remake, and as a a consequence have only just got round to watching it.Let's get this out of the way: this movie is not as good as the original, but it comes closer than I thought it had any right to. The film gets a '15' certificate here in the UK, which gave me alarm bells as I feared the gore, which was such a feature of the original, would be watered down. That fear didn't last long, as this film has got just as many gross, twisted transformations in it as Carpenter's version, and could have probably warranted an '18' certificate. Most of the FX are clearly CGI, but they're decent and you can also tell they were trying to make them look as close to the first film as possible, and it largely works.Issues? Sure. The characters are pretty thin and bar one or two I struggled to differentiate most of them and didn't care that much about them as there was next to no backstory. Even the main characters are wasted here, especially Egerton who seems to do or say very little. This film has a fairly lean runtime that could have possibly have benefitted from some extra character work, but given the nature of this film I guess I can kind of excuse the filmmakers using the cast as largely fodder to be picked off by the alien.The other issue I take with it is the actions of the alien itself. This thing can perfectly imitate people, yet time and again it's running around the place in the guise of a 7 foot spider with human bits sticking out of it, screaming and dripping in gore, which towards the end takes the tension out things a little as it degenerates into standard monster stalker fare, which if I'm honest isn't exactly unexpected. I read another review on here that suggests that the creature isn't experienced with humans and by the time Kurt Russell turns up has learnt it's lesson, so again, I can let this go to a degree.I think this film's strongest aspect though is that it's clearly been put together with great care and love for the original movie, right down to the sets, music, horrible sounds that the alien makes and a neat twist on the blood test scene in the 82 movie. It nicely sets the scene for the original film to begin, and I think justifies it's existence.I thoroughly enjoyed it and feel that it's a great companion piece to the classic original.",The Thing
317,dantonjames,CGI is not the only thing grafted on.,5,1 November 2021,"If it weren't for the fact that the wamen becomes the defacto leader of a group of a dozen men and is the only one making rational, sane decisions, free of overidding emotions while everyone around her becomes more and more unhinged, this would be ok. Add that to top notch practical effects, something the previous masterpiece was known for and you would have something pretty special. As it stands it's a serviceable movie whose characters don't feel real, just a collection of types, all very shallow. It's also trying for more of an action movie feel which completely misses the point.",The Thing

However, there is literally no legitimate connection between this movie and the 1982 ""sequel"". They throw in a scene during the ending credits that makes the connection, but it feels like a complete add on and has very little - almost 0 continuity with the movie we just finished.Seriously, how can they make such a rookie mistake?So, overall, this movie is pretty good except for the COMPLETELY botched ending.",The Thing
319,aristotle61,A Terrible Movie Adaptation of a Great Science Fiction Novella,1,10 August 2021,"I watched the 1951 and 1982 adaptations of ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell before deciding to watch this one. I had hoped that this one might do a better job of remaining true to the original story than the previous two. Sadly, this one is easily the worst. I could not even finish watching it.The cast is terrible, and boring. The movie wastes no time in making it clear that they have no interest whatsoever in staying close to the source material. After watching all three movies, I can only conclude that Hollywood thinks the average moviegoer is a moron, and will not accept any movie of this sort without there being a monster. I would imagine that it's also a lot easier, and requires much less talent from the people making the movie.I guess it's easy for me to say, since no one is throwing cash at me, or offering to put my name in movies, but if I had written the novella that the movies are based on I would never have agreed to any of these adaptations.Apparently they make a new ""The Thing"" movie every thirty years. Maybe the next one in 2041 will finally get it right.",The Thing
320,Azrael269,"Good, friendly, violent fun.",8,25 November 2011,"First of all, let me begin by saying I have not seen Carpenter's ""The Thing"", though I am aware of it and its flow. With that in mind, I want to point out that this is one of the rare cases in recent years where I have enjoyed myself so much with a horror flick.Having been touted as a remake, the only reason why I watched this was because I expected something terrible. In the end, I was pleasantly disappointed. Not only is this a worthwhile attempt to continue the legend but also a good film in its own right. Stressful, claustrophobic and with an interesting twist ending, although not really scary (but then, what horror film is scary after a certain age?), I find that this film got the job done and came out a winner.My only objection to this film would be the use of C.G.I. which does become excessive on occasion, luckily without a detrimental effect. On the contrary, it leads to one of the most spectacular moments of the film. Some could argue that it would have been preferred if the director had opted to use old-fashioned props for a more retro feel but I find that, overall, the computer graphics succeeded in their task.In the end, what remains is a good time. If you know what you are watching and don't sweat the world this movie creates (remember, suspension of disbelief is required in these films), The Thing will provide you with two hours of good, friendly, violent fun that you are likely to suggest to your friends. Mind you, one day later I would watch it again.",The Thing

322,mysteryman7162,I don't get all the negative reviews,6,25 November 2011,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of John Carpenter's 1982 film, so I was horrified to hear it was being remade. Luckily those early reports were incorrect as ""The Thing 2011"" is a prequel and not a remake. That said I had low expectations when I sat down to watch it as most of the remakes/re-imaginings of classic horrors recently have been poor.This isn't, in fact it's very good and comes over as an homage to the 1982 ""Thing"".I found the characters believable, the acting solid, the story well paced and the creature effects good, though not as gut wrenching as Rob Botin's creature. You really have to watch right until the end of the credits to see how neatly it the conclude to serve as an almost perfect companion piece to the 1982 film.To conclude don't believe the bad reviews watch this movie; and then the original, preferably in a double bill, and you'll see exactly what I mean, it's rare to see a prequel/sequel or remake show such respect to the source material.",The Thing
323,nettminder,A good addition to The Thing mythos,7,30 October 2011,I am a huge fan of Carpenter's The Thing and I think this movie only adds to the story of the Thing. This movie captured the paranoia and intensity of the Carpenter movie and adds some additional elements to the story with different characters and creature configurations. I am glad I saw this at the theater and will be picking it up on Blu-ray. The movie entertained me and was better than I expected. It seems today that Hollywood is never serious with the product anymore with prequels and sequels with a few exceptions. Some of the creature configurations were truly horrific. You would definitely not want the Thing coming after you. The final scene ties into the Carpenter movie quickly and effectively. I was wondering exactly how they were going to do that. Overall a good and entertaining movie in this genre. I am glad it was made.,The Thing
324,RecurringNightmare,A fitting sequel and awesome monster movie,9,26 October 2011,"The Thing was a very creepy, highly enjoyable monster movie that is a great sequel to John Carpenter's Thing. I can compare this movie to its original in the same way that I can compare Alien and its sequel Aliens. The first movie was a slow, dark, creepy horror monster movie, and the sequel is an action movie with scary monsters. This new Thing movie is much more of an action movie, and is none the worse for it.This movie has about twice as many cast members as the original, and thus twice the number of gruesome, freaky, exceedingly gory deaths. So there is twice as much happening as in the original, all within about the same length of time. In addition, this new Thing is a much more organic, mobile, quick monster. In the original, due to the special effects of the time, the Thing mostly just sat there and hissed and looked very scary. The only way it seemed to be able to kill anyone was if it tricked them into getting very close. The new Thing RUNS. It JUMPS. It chases and it crashes through walls on fire! Awesome. And honestly, the last thing I wanted to see in this movie was another long dark sequence of listening to antarctic wind blow and people looking scared. The new Thing is much faster paced while losing none of what made the first Thing one of my favorites. There is a big scare factor. Many times I was biting my fingers, on the edge of my seat, wanting to cover my eyes, my heart beating fast in my chest.I loved it, and fans of sci-fi or monster movies should love it too. I don't think that this movie deserves the negative reviews that it has received at all. They mostly seem to be fanboys who think that A: This movie is too much like the first one, or B: Not enough like the first one. In fact, the only thing that would have made the fanboys happy is if this movie was an exact replica of John Carpenter's movie, complete with Kurt Russell, but also totally different than Carpenter's.I'd like to remind everyone that Carpenter's Thing was not well received and got mixed reviews from the critics. It wasn't until many years later that the Thing got the attention and respect that it deserved. The haters should consider later on all the other truly horrible monster movies that have been made and give this movie the good ratings it really deserves.I believe that the new Thing stands on its own as an excellent monster movie and that comparisons with Carpenter's Thing are unfair and unreasonable. This movie delivered in every way that a modern audience could expect. If it had the plodding slow pace of Carpenter's then modern audiences would have gotten bored very quickly.The plot was solid, the acting from everyone was solid, the effects were quite good, though the CG was not quite at the realistic level I wanted to see (such as District 9). Mary Winstead did a great job as the heroine and has all the sci-fi girl cred she could ever want.I want to just urge everyone who is a fan of the original to give this one a chance and you won't be disappointed.",The Thing
325,ballisticwesker-263-233757,No! No! No! No!,1,15 June 2012,"Well the movie got Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ulrich Thomsen a good actress and actor. But it doesn't make the movie good. The movie really sucked! Around the time it is supposed to be scary I just wanted to laugh out loud or look away because it was so ridiculous. The so called ""monsters"" were made ridiculously unconvincing. Yes it's CGI and it's supposed to be convincing but it didn't convince me!While the original ""The Thing"" is absolutely fantastic this one is an embarrassment and almost s***s on the original idea of the original. Is Ulrich Thomsen the terrific actor getting desperate or what? He did terrific movies like ""Flickering Lights"" and ""Brothers"". Then he did ""Hitman"" and well he acted quite well but the movie wasn't anything special really. Then you suddenly see him in this movie?!Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a good actress but she plays unconvincingly in this one since the movie is ridiculous and there was no point in making it and it doesn't bring any originality or something new. It's just a product you can buy in the market it got no soul nor any new in it so it is a bad product. A cynical marketing exercise that is only supposed to get ""easy"" money. I don't usually give 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 stars because I don't like giving half stars.But since this movie sucked so bad I give it 1/10.",The Thing
326,Esswasim,Job not well done!,4,16 October 2012,"This movie is what it could have been, but still it can't be Alien1979, the difference between Alien and the thing is, Alien is in space and the thing in Antarctica, The Director has tried to Replicate Alien of 1979 which he couldn't achieve becoz of the replication of organic material of humans to alien cells, and becoz of not good development of characters in the movie, and becoz it seemed the director was in hurry to end production of the movie maybe due to time limitations I don't know... The movie starts nicely until we find the creature and then it fails to deliver the punch due to bad design of creatures and awful replication and straight forward deaths due to foolish decisions, we can debate on the whether deaths of characters were foolish or that foolishness just represents the disturbance caused among the crew due to unfortunate waking of the ALIEN ? But their expression didn't seem they were so much disturbed neither they seemed to be scared, so that debate would come to an outcome where we all will agree foolish deaths. Another flaw in the plot is for a those who care about accuracy of facts, the fact that alien cells can replicate the human cells and cannot replicate inorganic materials is a good fact but then why the replicas were wearing the same clothes ? Did the trousers get replicated too ? The ear ring was missing from one the characters means he is the replica but then he should be missing his clothes too but he is wearing them, that is a problem which can't be solved so easily in this movie and director would just ignore that as he did, hence making this movie lose few more points. The Good about the movie is the starting 20 mins or so and that is all, there is no suspense in the movie at all, it is just predictable till the end... Watch it if you want to kill some time seeing ugly creatures.",The Thing
327,dastaten,Waste of time,7,3 December 2011,"Take John Carpenter's version of The Thing, lower the quality of acting, throw in some CGI, and change the hero to a heroine, and you have the 2011 version. This movie does not improve upon Carpenter's version (or the original, really) and there was no valid reason to make it other than to make another buck off the story. It's a modern day monster movie that lacks the creepiness and the level of paranoia that Carpenter's version masterfully brought to the big screen. You'd do much better to give Carpenter's version another watch (even if you've already seen it a dozen times), rather than waste your time with this mediocre remake.",The Thing

They had actually used a lot of similar effects until the studio forced them to re-create everthing with CGI. They also made them change the ending. Then didn't even give the CGI team enough time to create quality effects. We could've had a far better movie if the studio didn't shoot themselves in the foot. I still enjoyed the movie. I love how they pieced it together with Carpenter's. I only wish the studio had let them just make the movie they wanted to make. Everyone would've been much happier with the results.,The Thing
329,Kinetek,Neither Fish Nor Flesh,4,3 December 2011,"There are some movies that leave out certain details, asking the viewer to fill in the blanks where no clear information is provided - and the 1982 version of 'The Thing' was one of those movies. Along with the infinitely debatable conundrum at the end that posed the question ""Was Childs infected?"", there was a section at the start of the film that begged to be elaborated on - namely, ""What happened to the Norwegian team?"".In the 2011 version of 'The Thing', rookie director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. attempts to tackle the question - but sadly gets a little confused with his delivery of the answer. Let me say at this point, that I loved the 1951 original ""The Thing From Another World"" and John Carpenters 1982 version equally, but unlike a lot of people who have left a review here, I didn't walk in expecting miracles. Lucky for me, because I didn't get any.Let's start with the positives. Location wise, it looks exactly as the 1982 version did, complete with long, badly-lit corridors traversing the Norwegian base, kennels and such like... but I'm afraid that's about it.Technically, it's adequate - but regarding the selling point (The Norwegian camp), the director seems to have had a change of heart about what it was he was trying to make. A confused, mish-mash of original plot hybridised with an almost beat-for-beat remake attempt, makes for very frustrating viewing - and I guess the most frustrating aspect of this film is this: no risks whatsoever have been taken.Few people would have dared taken a classic such as 'Alien' and tried to equal, nay, improve on it - but James Cameron did it and did it with such aplomb it's quite literally scary. The director and his team had the chance to really take this by the horns and create a completely different entity to 'The Thing' from 1982 - instead, they played it so safe you'll find yourself begging for the film to reach it's patchy finale.Acting wise, it's not great - in fact, it's not even good. Some of it is downright hammy. The CGI is laboured and in my humble opinion probably shouldn't have even been applied to this canvas. The monster itself looks suitably grotesque at some points and utterly bizarre at others.So, would I recommend it? Well, if you've got nothing better to do on a Sunday evening and it appears on one of your terrestrial channels, it's appropriate fayre - but I wouldn't pay the admission price. A real disappointment because it could have been so much more had the director and his staff decided to tear up the rulebook and created a brand-new, second-hand tale of isolation and terror - instead of trying (in parts) to emulate one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Many have tried, most have failed, and I'm sorry to say that this one falls into that category.3.8 / 10",The Thing
330,vicdmise-318-644671,A Worthy Addition,8,2 October 2021,"Don't let the low metascore fool you: the embarrassingly low critic's numbers are a badge of honor it shares with its predecessor, 1982's ""The Thing"". History has vindicated the first as a classic of filmmaking, and it will vindicate the second.Done with tremendous care, and many hat tips to the original, this second ""The Thing"" presents itself as both prequel and re-telling, introducing an entirely new generation to the concept of The Thing, while setting up the original movie to be the ""end"" of the story. The CG work is excellent, but tries not to overshadow the original; it simply adds to it. When the original's practical effects are viewed through modern day eyes, some can seem a bit tired, unfortunately, but still so much of it stands up: an homage to careful filmmaking. The sequel's cg effects do a beautiful job of dovetailing into those practical effects.The storyline both continues/pre-exists the original's action but re-tells it in a manner that works perfectly, and the action and directing is all admirable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is excellent in her acting, intense in her actions, and beautiful to watch.I went into this expecting nothing but the worst, and came out so glad to have it.

331,nmthomas-20486,American producers meddling created a mediocre ride,6,31 October 2021,"The good: Despite using CGI the body-horror moments are well done. It is a shame the director couldn't keep his original idea of no CGI however.The cast mainly do a good job- however the antagonist was poorly conceived, and felt his character faded to the background.I felt the best character building scene was when they were initially celebrating the finding of the alien with music and joyous celebration. It captivated the comoradary well between the cast. I wish they'd continued with this type of character building. I felt removed from the rest of the movie. I didn't feel what I wanted to feel- fear, isolation, horror, it felt disconnected.The dedication to recreating the Norweigen camp site and streamlining the movies was excellent work.The ending was good - I had read Kate is not meant to survive in the script which is left unknown in the theatrical release. I enjoyed the bleakness and ambiguity of the ending.I understand why the director went for exploration of the space craft. I can see what he was going for. But I don't think it was necessarily needed. However, I appreciate the effort to tie in the space craft more than the original movie did. Also to explain why Blair-Thing was creating a space craft of his own due to the fact Kate blew up the control room.The bad: The lack of atmospheric build up to the initial reveal of the alien. There was no scare for the audience and it felt rushed. I also felt they ripped off Alien in so many scenes; I like a reference but also originality! I thought the pace could have been more slow burning - like the director and screen writer wanted!The overall meddling of the producers in what the film was meant to be. You can see how the director compromises and didn't have full ownership over his own work.The inevitable comparisons to Carpenter's The Thing. This movie stood no chance! As a stand alone it may have faired better by critics. But it's canon in a universe which kept mystery as an element of its appeal!Elizabeth Mary Winstead is so utterly bland. I do not find her believable as a Ripley-esque character at all. She does an okay job but seems to stare blankly into space alot.Zero character development beyond clichés.Overall I didn't dislike the movie but I feel sorry for the director who stated he would never work in Hollywood again.",The Thing
332,inkster-9,Worth the wait,7,14 October 2011,"Why is it that so many people feel the need to forecast doom by doing comparisons. This film wasn't even released and it was written off by many who think that the 1982 version couldn't be touched. Well they were right, but only in one respect. The 1982 movie was an absolute masterpiece as far as the Sci-fi Genre goes. In fact, to me it's the greatest Sci-fi movie of all time, not because of the special effects or the so-called graphic gore, but because of the complete package - especially the brilliant cast, characters, suspense and the mood created by a great sound track. If you think the same as I do, then see the 2011 version. This one's not as great, but how could it be? Having said that it's a very good movie, which is surprisingly true to the 1982 version for the most part. Sequels (prequels) are usually a disappointment as they try to raise the bar and fail. This movie doesn't attempt that. It's as many people are saying, ""a companion"" to the 1982 version. It didn't fall into the trap of adding boring clichés or breaking the suspense with cheap laughs. It didn't try to change the formula too much and that's a good thing. Why re-invent the wheel. just make another interesting one.The 1982 movie was definitely worthy of it's 8.2 rating.

333,TheEnigmaticRonin,Decent.,7,11 August 2013,"Based on J.D Campbells story "" Who Goes There"", The Thing is a remake of a John Carpenter movie by the same name, which is again a remake of a Howard Hawks movie "" The Thing From Another World"". Even though its sometimes considered a prequel to Carpenter version, others insist its a continuation. When it could be both, or neither. Now that I have confused the hell out of you, lets get down to the review.Heijningen's The Thing, sticks closer to the John Carpenter version, both visually and story wise so it would be impossible to not compare them. While the story is basically the same, the pacing, in which its told, is completely different, unlike Carpenters version Heijningen's Thing doesn't build up any momentum, it never lets the cold barren environment really creep in, before it shows the alien, which is frozen just a few inches beneath the ice. Funny how the team is able to locate the alien-ship several km below the surface but not the alien itself, which is visible to the naked eye, anyways. So before you know it, the story has already kicked in, and we have monster on the loose, unlike the book, or the carpenter version where the monster is never clearly defined, in this version it is your average generic CGI ""crab-insect-alien"". Even though they stick to the formula of The Thing being a virus which clones its victims likeness, it makes it less scary, and ninja like, when you just show the damn thing, and not to forget, it looks like crap.The First half of the movie is your average generic alien movie, but then it gets back to its roots, and thats where things get good. The cast consist mostly of Scandinavian actors, mostly Norwegians, with the exception of the lead, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Scott Pilgrim VS The World), Joel Edgerton (Warrior) and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (G.I Joe) and a few others. Having a female lead character was a clever idea to change it from the earlier versions and keep the story fresh, her character is likable, and she does a good job with the role.This was also the Hollywood debut of plenty Norwegian actors such as Trond Espen Seim (Varg Veum), Jørgen Langhelle (Elling) to name a few, but surprisingly the character who stole the show for me personally, was the character named ""Peder"", played by Stig Henrik Hoff, he plays both a serious character, and the comedic relief. Most of their lines are in Norwegian.Ill keep it short and sum it up.Its inferior to both the Hawks, and the Carpenter version, but that doesn't mean its a bad movie, The production value is decent, its what you would expect from a contemporary remake, the alien effects are all CGI, it doesn't look organic at all, but still serves the purpose. The cast is OK, could be worse, and the direction is not praiseworthy but for a debut, its pretty damn good. An entertaining flick, with gross-out effects, decent acting, and Stig Henrik Hoff screaming ""Faen I Helvete!"" with a flame thrower, half the time, Check it out.",The Thing

Lots of red hearings that were so beyond unconvincing so I knew exactly who was and who wasn't a thing because this movie made it extremely obvious. The effects are absolutely pitiful and every time it was put on screen I bursted out laughing. The scares were all jumpscares which were all funny. There's no grit or substance to add any emotion what so ever. So the whole movie feels completely bland and hollow. You guys really screwed the pooch on this one.

335,PAULO-TEIXEIRA-1977,A great prequel of a great movie!!,8,10 December 2011,"Carpenter did a great job back in 1982. The Thing was a brilliant sci-fi movie that captured the audience for its originality, suspense and creepy moments. Not a lot of special effects back then, but the resources used were very convincing. The Thing was different, really remarkable and I confess that when I heard that a new movie was available I didn't get too impressed.However, The Thing 2011 was pretty original and instead of ""redoing"" everything all over again, it went the ""other"" way! This movie didn't limit itself to copy the ""cells"" of the original Carpenter's movie; it kinda surprisingly showed itself as a fairly original prequel! Good? Yes, good enough.The Thing 2011 ends exactly where 1982 The Thing started and the director of the movie just ""created"" his own version of all facts that happened in 1982's The Thing that we didn't know about or saw in the original Carpenter's movie. I'm not going to spoil anything by telling you what goes on, but everyone that has seen 1982's The Thing movie should not miss this one!

I'm saying it's a degrading copy of the original.When CGI is that bad, there is no excuse.
CGI everywhere, and it's so obvious.
The chopper in the opening sceene is just so bad, the surroundings and the ice.
The tracked vehicle that just sticks out like a huge spliter in my eye, it hurts so bad.
Just a quick, ""lets try to make some bucks out of a classic horror movie!"".
Instead of quality, they go for quantity and jump scares.
No finess and no feel for the art of a tru horror.
Just add some loud noices and a ""booh"" moment.This film should not have been made, and I think it shows when you see the line up of actors/actress.All across bad and dull.
But I guess it's not entirly down to the actors/actress.
It can't be easy playing an entire film against a green screen.
Where is the feeling?Remember the sceene from Ailien when the embryo hatches out of Kane's chest.

When music and sounds is in a perfect harmony.

337,darklits,Nice,10,19 November 2011,"I liked it. Having said that I did have an issue with 3 things. First: What I loved about the first remake was that it had a space scene, this did not. Numero 2: The reason I love North and South pole movies is that they have base's there. The first remake made it more cozier and made the base it self a character in the film. You started to learn your way around the base with familiar corridor's, bunk rooms and kitchens. With this latest remake they did not accomplish that. Even one of the X-files episodes made that happen(awesome episode BTW). 3 It was a bit strange that scholars and scientists of that magnitude would drill trough ice with an extraterrestrial entity inside it without contamination protocols. I mean There's all sorts of reasons why they should have taken proper lenghts to insure quarantine levels. I get that they had to move fast before word got out, but thats a pretty huge situation, so yeah they should have taken proper steps to insure safety. Thats all I have to say about this.

The filmmakers have obviously gone to great pains to do the original film justice, and ensure it ties in neatly with Carpenter's film.I thought the FX were highly faithful to the original creature designs whilst adding some new elements and WERE realistic enough to be scary!! - Everyone seems to be trying to find fault with this film, just because it had the audacity to be a prequel to an iconic film - I think the Star Wars prequels had a similar resistance, and can't help wondering if Prometheus will be unfavourably compared to Alien.I've read all the negative reviews, but ignore them and enjoy a thrilling, carefully constructed, successful prequel to the original film.IMHO, Hollywood definitely got it right on this occasion!!",The Thing

Especially due to the fact that I had seen the 1982 and 50s one already. So sufficed to say this one, being a prequel to 1982, screamed familiarity for me. While it feels slightly derivative at times, I think most that hate it just simply do so, because it's a prequel. The rest of the haters probably just didn't like the Thing all around to beginn with even the 1982 one. This movie stars a great cast of talented actors, neat CGI even If some of it is noticable at certain intervals, great suspense akin to the 80s and new improved Thing designs. That I think is best about it. The fact that it doesn't steal any creature designs from John Carpenter and his crew and chose to instead come up with brand new creature feature designs that meerely lean on the 80s'.This for me was well deserving of a 9/10. Well worth the watch time. It respects the original, does it justice, pays homage to it with little throwbacks that call back to the original 80s' and sometimes the 50s' respectively. Honestly the most jarring thing that caused me confusion was how many people got so wrapped up and caught up in hating and especially just finding talking points about it that they can hate.Atleast we have Chris Stuckmann as a parade example and rolemodel who shows us not to judge a book by it's (also pretty awesome) cover.",The Thing
340,to_see_you_smile_again,"A confusing ""prequel""",1,1 June 2012,"I don't understand this prequel at all. The producers stated that John Carpenter's original film was ""perfect"" hence their decision to make a prequel instead of a remake. But in making this prequel they have completely changed the entire premise of the original film, which is, in my opinion, subtlety, fear, mistrust, suspicion and a good use of the ol' fashioned ""whodunnit"" storyline. Kim Paffenroth sums up the fear of zombie movies really well, and I think it applies equally as well to the original The Thing: The suspense comes more from how the human characters interact. The movie has the suspense, paranoia, and claustrophobia of a movie about a siege, or a lifeboat full of survivors with limited supplies: the besieging army or the sea is a ""given"" and is not really the enemy, the real enemy is within the group, with the fear and ignorance that tears them apart and sets them against one another. Whereas the 2011 film seems only interested in trying to shock audiences, showing many graphic alien morphing scenes, and yet, none of them are nearly as frightening, gory, realistic or affecting as its 20-year-old predecessor. For scientist most of the people are complete idiots, and not in the entertaining ""don't go in there"" kind of way, but more in the face palming kind of way.

Scientists in the remote Antarctic discover a space ship, the occupant (monster) is frozen trying to escape the craft. Anyway, the best parts of this film are when the guy on the chopper who is infected starts to change. I WISH they had spent a little more time sneaking shots of his face and or body starting to change in to the monster. With tech effects, the film makers could have really gotten the fear factor into the audience buy delaying the chest busting tentacle, gutt octopus, then the chopper just spins off into the distance. I will not go much further on about the movie but I thought it was really good. The lead woman was good also.. gory, scary, tense.

Lots of gory CGI
Plenty of plot twists and suspense
Strong female lead characterCons:
Graphics were mixed in quality - sometimes excellent and at other times a little cheesy.Essentially no character development so that I really didn't care whether someone lived or died other than the lead character. Lol.Emotional distancing - I found myself being pulled-out of the emotional connection to the scenes whenever I had to read subtitles when the Norwegian characters spoke.

It fits like a LEGO with the 1980's version. I can't believe how well it fits. It adds back-story and enriches ""The Thing"" legend. The actors were all well cast and did a fine job. As far as the story goes, the beginning of the story seemed a little too much like the first ""Alien Vs. Predator"" movie. Once I got over that, I really enjoyed the flick. Lots of intense scenes. Good story with lots of variation from the 1980's version. This is not a re-hashed repeat. Great special effects leveraging all of today's technology, but not overdone. I am a skeptic and thought it would be hard to pull off another version of this. This is not a remake. This is an addition to the story. Highly recommended.

349,atreus_4971,Was it worth the effort? NO!,1,17 October 2012,"OK, so first things first, was this a prequel or a direct Xerox? Because honestly I couldn't tell. I'm really not going to go into details, such as why flame throwers would be on a research base in the first place, because there were plot holes in the original, so I'll just stick to the wishy-washy, drained out, colourless imitation that was this movie. The acting on the whole was not too bad. Standard American fare, lots of explosions and screaming, they seem to like all that. Mostly however it was utterly predictable and really nothing special at all. The plot: see John Carpenter 1982, it's exactly the same with the exception of a quick tour around an alien spacecraft. What this was supposed to add to the film I have no idea as it was entirely pointless. As many other reviewers have mentioned, this film lacked all and any tension or suspense. In the original sequences that had me leaping behind the sofa had me giggling and shaking my head in this version. I often felt that I had to concentrate just to maintain my interest rather than be gripped by the story. The characters: were there any? 'Poorly developed' is the understatement of the century. I finished watching this movie an hour ago and I honestly cannot remember one name or personality trait...hang on....oh yes, one had a filling, I think. I was bored with the 'alien' within twenty minutes and by the end of the film I was just yawning. By trying to make the 'alien' more scary with CGI they just ended up making it laughable. To this day I still have trouble watching the original, but this was almost a comedy in parts.Overall I'm glad I saw this on the TV because if I had stumped for a cinema ticket I would have been really annoyed. As it is I only wasted two hours when I had nothing else to do anyway. But seriously, if you want a good scare then watch the original, don't bother with this so-called prequel.I think Hollywood is losing the plot to be honest. I haven't seen a decent movie come out of there for a long time. I could cite Prometheus as a case in point but if I even think about that pile of crap I'll start seizing again. The modern American 'blockbusters' all seem so tired and clichéd. Maybe a little fresh blood and a few new ideas: and please Hollywood: NO MORE ZOMBIES!",The Thing
350,t-hunt910,Prequel tries to emulate original but at times falls short.,5,12 December 2011,"In its own right this film does have some merit. Credit should be given to the script writers who do try to link key events contained in the original film with the prequel . The film is particular effective in its first act, with the discovery of the entombed alien. Much tension is generated by the fact that audience have no idea what the thing looks like. The things explosive resurrection is handled very effectively. Unlike John Carpenters film which tries never to show the true appearance of the thing until the last act, this revels in show its appearance to the audience with mixed results. The original film still however shows the things nightmarish transformation more effectively. Replacing Kurt Russell character with female lead played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead adds a dynamic missing from the original film, but on the whole there fare less character development in this prequel. The paranoia most strikingly displayed in the original movie is largely absent apart from tense interrogation sequence in the rec room with its very gory ending. For a film which tries so hard to leave no loss ends, the unknown fate of the female lead is very irritating.

It was just too much, and as such, turned this into a effects movie without the true horror of the 1982 film It's very GOOD CGI... but just ""looks"" CGI. Fake. Would have been a lot better with far less. The whole saucer scene was un- needed. It was like they used every possible excuse to toss in the CGI. The 1982 film was far more suspenseful. Still, standing on it's own, it's a far better movie than Aliens 3, Prometheus, and the Predator knock offs. Imho, this is the lesser of the 3 Thing movies. The original was very good in it's day.

Make sure you increase the surrounds just a little bit, by the way.I'm a fan of Carpenter's 1982 ""The Thing"" film, and this prequel was pretty fair, I thought. The acting was good, the Thing's special effects were outrageous and intense, and there are a few surprises.It's not perfect, and a few things may leave you scratching your head thinking, ""but what about..??"" Oh well. LOL My only little complaints would be a few (just a few) more bits of clever humor spread out would have helped. And the Thing's first, conniving manifestation (on a plane) actually didn't look like the special effects were quite finished.Lastly, I wished we could understand the basic layout of the dwellings - so when people and Thing are running around, we'd have an idea of rooms in relation to one another for safety or defense, etc.Interestingly, the lead, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, seems to behave (and was maybe directed?) a lot like Sigourney Weaver from the first Alien (1979) film. It works fine, Winstead is good, if that was intended or not. Just interesting.Other than that, the overall plot is what you would generally expect, and probably fair to this specific adventure. Little, fun touches of style make it seem like it's 1982, right before the Carpenter film would start.

All the remakes of classic 80s action or sci-fi movies tend to retread the original but leave out the soul which, for most movies, is a good script and compelling characters and acting. Unfortunately, these components are largely absent here.I didn't feel like I got to know any of the characters except the lead and, no offense to the actress, I did not remotely buy her as a world renowned Arctic paleontologist.None of this would be a problem if the movie had something else going for it, like edge-of-your-seat action sequences or a memorable monster.

This film is awesome...it brings back good old fashioned horror and suspense.The performances are strong and Winstead solidifies her legendary status in fan boy and geek worlds by continually picking projects that showcase her talent while not compromising her integrity.Edgerton has been on a streak with another fantastic performance.Beltrami's score is nostalgic while refreshing.This film is a perfect companion piece to Carpenter's film.Solid filmmaking!

In fact, every Halloween I watch ""The Fog"" and ""The Thing"" back to back. Having seen the remake of ""The Fog"" (terrible, IMHO), I kept my expectations low for this film.However, by the end of the film, I was super excited. Not only does the film segue perfectly into the JC version, but it answers every question about the Norwegian camp from the JC version. The attention to detail is astounding. How did the axe get in that door? There. How did the two faced creature get outside? Shown. What about the ice block, and the dog, and so on and so forth... It's like the writers and directors picked over the original frame by frame and made it fit without seeming hokey.Now, it's clearly a different film. It's updated for the 2010's. The effects are CGI, and they're more crisp. However, they match the effects of the original closely enough (at least what Rob Bottin could pull off at the time, plus what he wished he could do) that it felt consistent. It's not quite as tense as the JC version, where the focus was more around paranoia, but I attribute that to the time and the audience. Still, there are scenes that are direct homages, and the score and sound effects beckon back to the JC version enough to appeal to the fan of the previous while building tension for the new viewer.Was it enjoyable and scary? Plenty enough for me. Good acting? For a horror film, yes. Action aplenty? Sure, with some ""typical"" types of ""rescued at the last minute"" shots that we all can say we've seen before, but still enjoy.Ultimately, I couldn't have done this better myself with a crack crew of writers and a $100M budget. The filmmakers exceeded my expectations, and demonstrated a real reverence to the JC version, while creating an entertaining film on it's own. For that, I applaud them.",The Thing

358,nirvana_state_of_mind,Completely Missed the Point of Carpenter's film,3,15 October 2011,"First of all, like many others I have to say that I am a huge fan of John Carpenter's The Thing. I was looking forward to the Norwegian prequel as I love Ronald D Moore's version of Battlestar Galactica and thought he would really nail this as well if he wrote the screenplay. I first saw The Thing on VHS at the age of 16 over 20 years after it originally was released in theatres. What I loved about the film was the tension created based on the characters' paranoia of not knowing who to really trust to be a human. It was this quality that I believe made the film as compelling as it was. The monster effects were very impressive for their time, but for me they came secondary to the paranoia aspect of the film.So if this is to be an actual faithful prequel, any fan of The Thing should accept Kurt Russell's monologue that the alien has tendencies to strike only when it is alone with another person and will try to take the whole group over slowly by hiding amongst them. The problem with this so-called prequel is that the alien does anything but that. We are treated with plenty of gross out monster revealing effects where the alien straight up attacks the humans, sometimes taking out three humans at a time. This action completely undermines the original where the idea was that the Thing was vulnerable when it was out in the open. All this prequel provides is gross images of a monster that attacks humans who then fight back with whatever weapons they have on hand. This aspect got boring really fast, whereas the paranoia aspect of the original played a very minimal role in this film. When a character was revealed to be a Thing, it really had no impact at all as there was not enough character development to really care about it. I realize Carpenter didn't have much more character development, but he still had enough for the audience to be blown away when the creature chose to reveal itself.Yet the most flawed trait of this film could be pointed out by a young Stephen Spielberg or Ridley Scott 30 years before this film was even made. Much like Spielberg's shark in Jaws or Scott's original Alien, the alien in Carpenter's The Thing was hardly ever shown. The tension that was created from all these films was built off of what was not seen. The audience knows that the monster is a real threat to the characters and we also feel the tension of how the characters treat each other because of this threat. It was this aspect of these films that worked so well, not the violent gross out special effects of monsters attacking humans.To summarize, I was highly disappointed with this film and would rank it with The X-Files: I Want to Believe as the worst movie I have ever gone to see in theatres. Fans of Carpenter's The Thing will not benefit in the slightest from seeing this film and the so-called tie-ins are so shallow that it is better to preserve the mystery of the Norwegians that the original film created.",The Thing

And reading the reviews of the 2011 prequel it would seem the only thing it too has in common with the original is its Arctic location. The 1982 remake (if you can call it that) had none of the terror and excitement of the 1951 version. In the 1982 version you would never know that any of the characters were actual scientists and there was a definite lack of U. S. Air Force types who helped open up Arctic exploration as depicted in the original. From the reviews it looks like they rounded up the usual suspects from the 1982 version.

It was really building up steam, especially with the clever idea of mouth inspections but, as a warning to you all, after the Americans reappear from the helicopter, run, run for your life. From there, the previous critics are correct. I figured their critiques were just adolescent whining. But, no. It dissolves into a mediocre, ""monster gone ape,"" C.G.I. fest. No scares, no gloom, no creepiness, no horror just a messy graft from Aliens, The Blob, The Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean or any fantasy film where the intent is ""Bigger means more,"" especially since it rarely does. This film even comes depressingly close to the pretentious ""Colossus: The Forbin Project(1970),"" with its central computer, power-source contraption that can only seem ""cool, man"" to the ""fresh out of high school"" art student who designed it. There are references to other films and ""The Thing"" (1982), everywhere. Even the silly end scene where the wood walkway starts popping up behind Kurt Russell as the Thing slithers under the floor is replicated by the flaps of the spaceship flipping up as Kate and Sam run across its surface. (it's a flat-footed effect a thousand 1980s films exploited) The film had some genuine pulse to it in the first 3rd but it flat-lines afterward. I won't even describe the out of sync sound track that comes and goes for no reason. And couldn't they find a dog that came closer in appearance to the original? It's almost hilarious how different it appears from the splice they stuck in from the 1982 version. You might as well have used Pluto. It's a shame they second-guessed themselves by listening to so many John Carpenter freaks who screamed 2 years ago about what this film would turn out being. The original, test trailer from 2010 was better than this. It was dark, mean and threatening including a great morphing scene in the snow which was discarded. Apparently they went back in and made it as close to John Carpenter's version but crashed in doing so. It should have had its own personality even if it irked its detractors. The peak and creepiest segment of this new film is the helicopter scene. It's vicious and fast. After watching that scene, leave and go shopping at the mall.

Examples..when kate sees the alien craft and the actual alien, her reaction is ""oh, cool!"", it should be more like ""OH MY GOD THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!"" They basically burn everything in site, aliens, people, rooms, furniture - everything gets torched but they're standing in the middle of it all flames all around them with no smoke or any feeling of being blasted by heat from the blazing inferno.

Did we really need to behold the power of a Crystal Skull, watch Gordan Gekko adjust to modern life, or follow a Vietnam veteran as he rips out larynx's across Burma? John Carpenter's The Thing had so many memorable ideas that most are used again in Matthijs van Heijningen Jr's The Thing (Doesn't really have the same ring to it). I guess somethings (like flamethrowers, fonts and freaky spider-beasts) can't be topped, so let's just keep them in there.What is most disappointing about this film, aside from the lack of tension and isolation that was intrinsic to the original, is the visual effects, confirming our beliefs that twenty year old models and puppets look more realistic than Jar-Jar Binks ever could. Also, the abundance of bearded characters makes it impossible to differentiate who's who when the shite hits the fan (quite early), and there was no way to keep track of how many were alive by the final sequence.However, that's not to say the movie is all-bad. It's quite pacey, has enough decent acting and a great score (reminiscent of Jonny Greenwood's ominous strings in There Will Be Blood), making it fairly entertaining.

365,techcharles,this is the reaction of a 16yr old kid that I observed.,4,11 June 2017,"I feel I was biased, being a fan of the original, so I recorded the reaction of a 16yr old 2yrs ago. He had never seen either movie before, but was desensitized because he was a horror fan. (used to gore-violence)This prequel never made him jump out of his seat, but the original did. (2 inches, in fact) He said the creature had no consistent strategy, except at the end. ""there was a little paranoia, but not enough to put you on edge."" The creature effects weren't as scary as the original, because it wasn't ""juicy and organic and messy"". He also noted that there were no uncomfortable silences, either. He did like the alternative test idea to find out who was who....but wondered why they didn't go for the blood test 1st thing. I told him it would have been copycat work to do so....and this had to be different. He agreed. The rec room gore scene did make him cringe, though. To sum up: this prequel was a creature-feature movie, the original was a horror movie.For me, I knew there was too much to live up to, and simply accepted it. Would have loved more final dialogue between the Thing-guy and the heroine when she had the flame thrower pointed at him....something like: ""where are you from?"" ""I don't know."" ""Are you a weapon of some kind?"" ""I don't know."" ""What are you?"" ""That which survives."" ""Not this time."" ""Not here, but somewhere else for sure.""",The Thing
366,kolrimes,Aliens with no agenda,1,22 October 2011,"Silly movie that tries to rely on its monster-tech and very little else. More aliens in a too-big craft with no apparent purpose other than just be here for a long time and finally create havoc. And their spooky attributes just keep multiplying---which is a mark of the worst kind of supernatural story. If it had gone 15 minutes longer, the aliens would have become totally psychic and would have started reading minds, or maybe they did already. Off-worlders have usually evolved in wherever they are from with some awesome biological weapons. Why didn't man get some? How come we can't harpoon people with a tentacle or whatever? Also, aliens usually have some awesome fangs. Again, why didn't we? Oh, forgot to mention that aliens also drip goo wherever they go, stuff that made Sigourney Weaver slip in earlier and equally stupid movies. And speaking of women, boy, is Winstead really important here! She outdoes everyone. I thought that role was reserved for the Black Guy in these modern films, or at least a sage Asian. Instead, hope is kept alive by a cute Caucasian woman who seems to know about everything. Norwegians who sing incomprehensible and drab folksongs are usually there to be wasted, so no surprise here. Norwegians are, like all foreigners in movies, highly expendable. Dumb, clichéd movie all around.",The Thing

I'd guess they made a movie assuming almost the whole audience had to have watched the original. And they did it really well, despite the limitation that almost everyone watching it knew exactly what the Thing was, and so they couldn't use the mystery and suspense of the original. That made a prequel really difficult, we all know exactly what the Thing is and does. But within those confines the movie is a classic in it's own right.",The Thing

369,pocodfe,Interesting.,8,19 July 2012,"It goes without saying, anyone reviewing this must have seen John Carpenter's remake of THE THING (1982). That film is a cult classic and my absolute favorite horror and sci-fi film of all time. It is that good, and remains that good, because it's unique: all male cast, totally clueless who (or what) is ""the thing,"" and the ending leaves you wondering a lot.So, to watch this 2011 version, the first thing I noticed was the opening text on the screen where is says we are in 1982 (still) and in Antartica (still). This alone confusingly tricked me into thinking, ""Okay, this is a total remake...ugh!"" But at the end of the film, DURING THE CREDITS (bizarrely unique) you are then shown that this movie is a prequel to Carpenter's film. Different approach.The movie moves too fast, and the gripping drama you felt in 1982 is just not here in 2011. This film is certainly not bad, and some approaches are really cool, like the new way to figure out who is ""the thing,"" which I won't reveal.Personally, I felt there were just too many people in this film, leading to too many instances of people being quickly killed instead of taken over. A smaller cast would have been so much more easier to deal with, and would have allowed SOME character development.Going up against Carpenter's film this ""prequel"" had a lot to live up to. It doesn't, but it's certainly not bad at all...definitely worthy of watching, and some moments are really tense...but it needs more drama for sure.",The Thing

I also admit that I can be a bit harsh on horror movies since I don't tend to scare easy. All that being said, in review, The Thing, just seemed like another attempt at a plot that seemed very familiar to me in Alien Vs Predator. The movie really didn't make a lot of sense to me. I guess most aliens have the intelligence to travel billions of billions of miles just to crash land on Earth and then get frozen in the most inhabitable part of our planet. I know, I know, I am over analyzing it all, but it just seemed a bit off to me.There were a few scary scenes and some creepy creatures, but it all seemed a bit too much. If you are just looking for a scary movie that will hopefully get the person next to you to jump into your arms, this may be the right film for you. If you're like me and looking for a good thriller or psycho drama, I'd recommend that you pass on this one and wait for a better thriller to see in the theater.",The Thing

The main character is played by (IMO) a very bad actress.watching this movie was very disappointing...

373,MLewis8,"Looks decent, tolerable, but not recommended",6,14 October 2011,"I loved John Carpenter's The Thing (1982), and this ""prequel"" does not compare to it at all. The effects were OK and the film was watchable. However, there was no character development . . . I didn't know anything about them and didn't care what happened to them. There were too many plot holes - such as no explanation how Joel & Adewale's character's survive the helicopter crash with the Thing inside it, how does the helicopter pilot at the end know Lars, what did Joel and Adewale do to Lars and where was Lars, what was he doing during the entire time since, just to name a few. If the Thing can replicate animal cells, and not metal objects . . . well how can it replicate the clothing the human is wearing! There's no explanation for that (I know the Thing replicated clothing in Carpenter's too, but I just kind of went with it . . . here they added this limitation of what it couldn't do, but that just begs the question about the clothes). Some of the scenes were ripped offs straight out of 1982 - the check the teeth scene (obviously from the check the blood scene in '82); the scene where dude gets knocked out from the explosion and later his arm comes off and crawls (similar to '82, dude gets knocked out/has heart attack and later his head crawls away). This Thing doesn't has the same MO as the '82 Thing. The latter was strategic, like a chess player (hence the chess playing scene in the beginning), picking its' victims off one by one until it felt threatened. The Thing in this film felt all over the place like a slasher movie. How does this tie into '82 when the M.O. is different? Where does Kate come into play in '82 if she presumably lives in this one? Finally, I felt the movie cheated - I didn't feel like there was any moment after the Thing first breaks lose where the characters were isolated and thus could have been assimilated (in contrast to the '82 version where several characters were left alone with the Thing dog). No logical explanation whatsoever how the Thing got dude in helicopter, the one chick Thing (again, no character development - didn't even remember her name) that tried to trick Kate, etc. I didn't feel like anyone could be the Thing, I felt like the film was cheating me. This movie is not painful to watch if you turn your brain off, I might watch it again when it comes out on TV just to see if I just missed something out of what I perceive to be a bunch of plot holes. However, when I walked out of the theater, I just didn't feel like telling anyone to see this movie. Definitely see John Carpenter's The Thing. Can't recommend this ""prequel"".",The Thing
374,jusdiz2,"Great atmosphere and tension, but you always think about the original movie",8,8 December 2013,"I liked the atmosphere in this film, which reminded me of the Carpenter's The Thing. The episode when the American girl is watching through the window on the first night is great! This movie is not a simple copy of the original, it adds some to the story, and you can see it in the ending of the movie. Some characters are Norwegians and they speak Norwegian, I think this distracts a little bit of the viewers attention. And the main character - American girl - is not so charismatic as Kurt Russell or some of the Norwegians in this movie. How you choose actors is important to the movie, and I think it's probably the main flaw.

376,jill-deschrijver-369-684932,The Thing doesn't add up,4,6 December 2013,"I have never seen the 1982 movie, and thus unable to make any comparison. The prequel plot and effects seem fine and interesting enough at first, but very soon the whole plot falls apart because the Thing's actions go against any survival logic.To begin with the Thing supposedly assimilates a victim in order to hide amongst the population and then parasite on it. But that would only truly work if, once it assimilates in such a small population, it does not blow its cover all the time by attacking other people at random all the time. Its main intent is to reach the outer world. But its rapid attacks as soon as it feels like it (for example by bringing down the first helicopter) simply do nothing but self-sabotage.This is a survival logic similar to that of a virus or bacterial disease. Diseases that hit quickly (possibly kill quickly) also must spread quickly and need a large population. In too small a population, the disease may kill everyone in that small population but since this happens so quickly, the disease dies along with the population. Slower diseases that can spread around for days, months and even years before showing symptoms can start in a small population and kills nobody yet for a long while, and thus has all the time in the world to spread into a bigger population.The Thing in this prequel does the first thing. And that would work if it were an alien with the consciousness of an insect (like Alien). But this Thing comes from a some super intelligent species that traveled the universe in a spacecraft. It is smart enough to learn languages, to drive a UFO, but not smart enough to keep its cover under wraps for more than an hour? It has this intelligent biological assimilation abilities and look like a perfect human or dog, and yet at times it crawls on spidery eights with two fleshy heads? It just doesn't add up. I know, one needs to set aside some notions of reality, but even then the Thing's behavior, its intelligence, and its biological abilities must still add up.",The Thing

What kills it for me is the CGI.One of the things that made the 1980s The Thing such a masterpieces were the practical effects- they are just legendary. It still holds up today and I have yet to see any movie since then do what they did so masterfully with practical effects. Which is what really hurts this prequel.If you take the bad CGI out of it, it's a pretty good movie. Good cast. It does a good job of filling in the blanks of what happened before the 1980s version.But it's certainly nowhere near as good as John Carpenters movie, but then I don't think anything ever will be.

378,iandaddio,stand alone yes prequel? two massive flaws,8,13 November 2012,"OK so it was a courage concept to begin with. to conceive adding to a unique (and its very very very rare i use that word) and complete unit.John Carpenters film from 1982 was unique and complete. it was complete in its atmosphere, the brooding paranoiac disorientated shuffling of a group in disintegration, bouncing between the need for companionship and safety in an already inhospitable and dangerous environment and a sense of isolation and frustration of being amongst a group of familiar creatures but also feeling completely cut off from each other due to the invisible alien potential of each member of the group. this not only portrayed through the action but also through lighting, sound, and contrast of texture; the familiar sheen of flesh stretched and distorted, the true alieness of the creature only seen when its internal structure is revealed.this constructed a uniquely futile struggle against inherent nihilism and the human delusion of divine right to conquer.so the only way to go in conceiving an addition or adaptation would be to begin the story. makes sense on paper and sounds interesting too.however, this is where the completeness of John Carpenters creation was not fully considered.firstly, the technique used in the 82 film to build intrigue and atmosphere about the opening sequence with the dog is the comprehensive video data (remember there was over 9 hours of film) found at the Norwegian base. in reviewing this the cast joins us the audience in our discovering the narrative of the story, brilliant method of bonding the audience with the players.now this might seem irrelevant until we come to the discovery of the craft in the 2011 adaptation (and this is why i refer to it as an adaptation and not a prequel) it is clearly seen in the 82 film, and commented on by childs, that the full nature of the Norwegian scientists discovery comes from the uncovering of the craft using explosives, as childs states incredulously 'and look they're using thermite!'.so why in the 2011 film is this omitted??? how can you eradicate such an important event from a narrative and expect it go unnoticed? the craft does not uncover itself as shown in the closing scenes of the 2011 film, it is uncovered and there is video evidence to this fact! first time around i had to stop watching until i had calmed down (yes i know i am a complete geek when it comes to the thing) then it took me a while to reconfigure in my mind that the 2011 thing was an 'adaptation' of the concepts and premises set up in the 1982 film.so OK this began to work for me and i was able to settle back in and enjoy the film in its own right, until the closing scenes where once again the writers seemed to slip into their 'aaah no one will notice' delirium.i am referring to the issue of where in the original does it mention, refer to, or include details of finding a burned alien corpse two snow cats and, AND! the frozen remains of a us palaeontologist at the crash site?? or am i just being too pedantic here? whether i am being too pedantic or i am not, this for me detracted from the potential of this movie 1 to pay homage to the impact and influence the original had 2 to bring something new to the table.yes as a stand alone movie this is not bad, some interesting touches in the development of the assimilation process (yeah OK there is the pointless microscope with playback feature for hearing how the cells sound when they are absorbing their prey) also there is the comparative element in each film of, how would another culture deal with this phenomenon?but as a prequel? then i feel given the points i have detailed above this version is a poor, shoddy,insubstantial, and ill considered attempt at cashing in.",The Thing
379,toontje-1,"Good tie in to the original, less than satisfying execution",4,23 December 2011,"Mathijs had a great opportunity to make a great sequel/ prequel. There were so many ways it could have been a great classic, but they choose style over substance. This movie really felt like I was watching a cinematic cut scene in a video game. The characters a like that new coworker that introduces him- herself the first day and it's only weeks later that you really get to know your colleague. The timing of the film outpaced the character development, well most of them were killed within the first 10 minutes of the movie and the rest were hiding for the remainder of the movie (until they got snagged by the Thing that is).Everything is shot in digital crispiness. No feeling of claustrophobia, no sense of paranoia other than the artificially induced one, because the script said so.It had its moments though, like a match you lit and then quickly died out. The film stock should have been grittier, the lighting should have been kept very dim and high contrast. The CGI was very well done, but at times it looked like it was clearly superimposed on the film. My personal experience is that suspension of disbelief is better achieved with puppets than with CGI.All in all I think this is a good bad movie and it cleverly linked this episode to the original, but regretfully it fell into repetition at times and it left a lot of avenues in the plot unexplored. Thankfully they didn't kill the franchise by dumbing it down and there is still hope for a sequel. I guess my only beef was the execution (no pun intended).",The Thing

The CGI is just bl eh - seen it a thousand times before. The Director was completely incapable of winding up the movie - leaving an end-credit pastiche to tie it in with the John Carpenter movie as an afterthought. Pointless US actors. Pointless scenes where I was left feeling ""we know f's"" such as the /facepalm worthy close up of the US guy's Earring. I really did /facepalm at that bit.My suggestions? Grow balls. Avoid bad CGI, the usual requisite complement of US actors, naff standard monster chases, assuming the audience is mind bogglingly stupid (earring shot) and take some time figuring out how things will tie in with John Carpenters movie instead of handing it off to the 2nd unit at the last minute.",The Thing
382,bokonon82,Doesn't line up with original,5,31 October 2018,"It's odd how a bigger budget and ""better"" effects with an ok story, do not add up to a movie equally as good as the original. I find it strange how the monsters in the original are more scary AND seem more real. The CGI is quite mediocre to the point where physical puppets made of foam and syrup (whatever they used) are way more terrifying.I am not a long time fan of the original. In fact, I just watched both for the first time in the last few weeks. Aside from the poorly executed effects, the store really doesn't make much sense in the prequel.Here's why:In the original, they come to the realization that each cell of the ""Thing"" is sort of an individual being that also acts as an entire sentient being in combination. The individual components of the being will try to escape when threatened OR they will expose themselves when they have another living thing cornered in a way where they may mimic them without being discovered. Thus, you have the dog going after the other dogs to mimic them or the hidden instances where humans are copied if caught alone.Then, you have the moments where the ""Thing"" is threatened and hit their own ""fight or flight"" mode to escape. These include the mouth opening on the stomach when shocked by paddles to correct a heart rhythm, the head trying to escape the body when it was burning, AND the blood reacting to intense heat during the ""test"" which caused the ""Thing"" to react and fight back. The point is that the ""Thing"" does not expose itself unless it is under direct threat.In the prequel, the ""Thing"" just randomly exposes itself. I feel like the writers/director didn't really watch the original or some producer came in and screwed it all up.",The Thing
383,stubs182,Why did this movie suck so much?,1,29 November 2011,"What a surprise someone complaining about a recent Hollywood prequel of a beloved franchise on the internet how original right? Listen I get it, I hate having to be that guy. I wish that I could be writing how much I loved this movie and how amazing it is, hell I would love to have found at least one thing positive to hold on to but that unfortunately would just be a lie. I was massively optimistic going in and very skeptical of all the negative reviews that had been popping up prior to my viewing of the movie. They don't know what they're talking about, I told myself, they just love to hate on things because that's the 'cool' thing to do these days. After all how could they possibly mess this up? It's such a perfect concept and what's more, it's pretty simple. As the classic Spielberg quote goes any great film plot can be summed up in one sentence: Alien creature could be anyone (in snow). Not an overly convoluted structure but one that worked so well in John Carpenter's 1982 version, so well that it remains one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm not complaining about how the prequel pooped all over the original, I'm just disappointed and somewhat baffled by just how they could have made such an awful failure of a movie with such a rich concept to work with? ? Surely there would be at least one good thing about this movie, right? RIGHT?? Even if this was just a standalone movie it would still suck, it just doesn't work. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful, it's not tense, it's not dark, it's not exciting, it's not really anything. Coming away from this movie the best way I could describe it was just hollow.There's just nothing to it, it's an empty husk. It feels like exactly what it is a big pay check for everyone involved with no creative drive behind it whatsoever. I find it hard to believe that anyone involved with this movie cared at all about the original they didn't even care about just making a decent movie!! And if they did it certainly does not show one single bit. You can almost feel the apathy soaking through every aspect of the movie. From the blank expression on Mary Elizabeth Winstead's face to the pointlessness of every scene to the almost laughable lumbering joke a CGI monster.I don't know if there was a definitive moment during the film in which my heart began to sink but when the Thing started chasing people down corridors it was the beginning of the end. The Thing does not chase people around. What should have been an intense psychological expression of human paranoia is now just a lazy, stupid creature feature and a bad one at that. It's Hollywood telling us in no uncertain terms, You are so stupid the only way you'll understand this is if we have a big stupid looking creature who's all 'Blarg I'm a scary monster coming to get you!!' lumbering awkwardly down a corridor and then have a pretty young girl running the opposite direction who's all like 'Eeeek help me'. And let me tell you nothing feels better in this world than being treated like a moron, right? You guys all love that feeling don't you, because there' s no way you would ever understand anything even slightly subtle, you're far too stupid for anything like that. Well thanks a lot Hollywood you condescending asshole. So it's a prequel, so you're already going in with a different perspective. You have your internal check list, the block of ice, the Axe in the wall etc. etc. And the filmmakers obviously knew this would be our mind-set as an audience, and then apparently went out of their way to antagonize us. Now I'm acting like a fan boy right? Hear me out, you've seen the original movie two Norwegian dudes chasing the creature in husky who quickly meet untimely ends at the American camp, and now we have a prequel. Finally a chance to explore these characters, find out what drove them to this end, who are they as people what horrors have they witnessed in the frozen wasteland. An amazing set up for a movie, so how does the prequel answer these questions? Well as it turns out, poorly is how. In an absolutely stunningly questionable decision they get all of 10 seconds in the end credits!! What were they thinking?? One of the guys isn't even in the movie until this point and isn't referenced to once!! He just shows up in the helicopter out of nowhere, he doesn't know what the Thing is, he's never witnessed the creature transform, he has no idea other than what Lars shouts at him in 5 seconds before they just jump into the helicopter and leave and THAT'S IT. They may as well have inserted another clip in the credits, just the smug face of Hollywood exec grinning as if to say, Yeah audience those are the guys from the original movie, I bet you love that don't you, you stupid audience. Well no Hollywood I didn't love it, it sucked. They took a concept that could have been brilliant and just pooped all over it? Why? This is what I'm left asking, the film is just a series of god awful choices. It would have taken just one person who looked at the last page of that script to speak up and say 'Hey you guys all know this sucks right? Why are we making a prequel that shows such disdain for these characters?' This is why I stand by my previous statement that they are deliberately trying to antagonize us.

384,booyahboy_uk,The Thing lite,6,25 March 2012,"I had very high hopes for this film seeing as how this particular brand of horror has been somewhat out of favour recently. Unfortunately the film just doesn't deliver. For reasons best known only to Hollywood accountants, a story which is set in what we assume to be a Norwegian only base is half over run with Americans and even an Englishman or ""British"" as the American viewers like to think citizens of the UK refer to ourselves. The problems with this one arise in that given viewers who have seen the John Carpenter film are going to be a large proportion of the audience the script writers deliberately set up a chain of events which can be directly paralleled in the previous version. It is really difficult to tell whether this is supposed to be a prequel or a remake, and given it has exactly the same title, I'm not sure the studio executives could make up their minds either.My big problem with it is the special effects sequences just aren't as disturbing as the ones Rob Bottin created so masterfully in 1982. In fact as I learned the effects people responsible were also involved in 1992's Alien 3 I can't help but get the feeling that they have managed twice in a row to disappoint me greatly. Following from Stan Winston in 1986's Aliens and now Rob Bottins 1982 The Thing.There is no real reason to have a female lead in the film and it makes the sequence of events where she establishes herself as the leader even more implausible.Maybe this was a commercial move by the film makers, one can only wonder, instead it has to be pointed out that in allowing her to survive the climatic scene it creates more questions than it actually answers; where the following scenes depict the events leading up to the start of the 1982 film.",The Thing
385,macca197338,As stand alone movie it was good,7,5 December 2012,"I love the Carpenter original, so took very little notice of this movie when it came out, thinking it would be another poor ""remake"". However having watched it last night I was very pleasantly surprised.I've read other reviews about the lack of claustrophobia, the prominent use of CGI and the lack of character development, but I disagree. This is a different movie, being a prequel, in a different era. The horror movies of the 70's and 80's were fashioned primarily due to limitations in special effects and the cost. Carpenter's original was no different.This is a different time with technology available to give the monster the justice it deserves. Lets face it, how many of us watched it with that voyeuristic intention of seeing just what the CGI wizards would do with it? The story moves with pace, but again, the majority of viewers will know what the beast is about, so why slow it down?If I did have a complaint was that in parts it couldn't make its mind up if it was a prequel or a remake. The Rec Room scene was far too similar to the original from the collapsed team member, the resulting carnage and the squaring off between the team as to who was and who wasn't infected.My other irritation was a somewhat contrived story line designed to tie in the ending with the start of the original while delivering a ""happy ending"" for the heroine. Tell me, why would you run off chasing the The Thing back to its ship and leaving Lars, the big Norwegian work horse who seemed to produce flame throwers, grenades and assault rifles from thin air, locked up? To tie up this loose end there was merely a throw away line as Lloyd and Carter speed after the Sander in the snow mobile where Lloyd asks if Carter had killed him. It was there purely so that Lars could be found in time to chase after the escaping dog.This aside, if you take it for what it is, it was a quite enjoyable movie with decent effects, good acting and an adequate story and script. I was certainly left with fewer questions than after watching Prometheus!!",The Thing
386,pinkseashell09,Not what I was Expecting,6,16 October 2011,"Okay, I really did like this movie and the trailer made me itch to watch it. Let me just say that I never got around to seeing the original the thing back in the 80's, so this review will be judging the movie of 2011 and not comparing it towards the original.Pros: The alien was great, although you could tell that is was computer generated, it was very interesting to see the ways it could alter the human body. I loved the setting in Antarctica, isolation to the outside world. Action begins very early in the movie which allows me to stay focused. The fight scenes where great and creative in my opinion. Best of all, no one knows who the thing is, what is is where it came from etc.All we know is that it has to eat everything basically *Spoliers* Cons: Its obvious that the first scientist we see who asks the female lead to come to Antarctica is an asshole. He does not want to give up the investigation even though people are dying! The ending leaves you with a feeling like...what just happened? The biggest problem I had with this film was that it plainly did not make sense. First we see the things gigantic spaceship so automatically I thought damn this thing must be very smart to be able to fly and create that space ship. But then once it pops out of the ice block it begins eating everything. The thing was acting so primitive like a hungry wild animal meanwhile it can be sophisticated enough to handle that giant space ship? Its a primitive being but it knows how to fly a ship?The other problem I had with this movie is that I could not tell how the characters were :infected"" by it? The guy on the helicopter just burst but the thing was incinerated and dead previously? How did he get the thing's blood on him? Did we miss that scene? There was another character that attacked the main character while she was looking for keys, how did she get the thing inside her??? It never mentions this. Basically this movie had so many plot holes that needed to be filed, I'll name a few 1) Does the thing know how to speak English/Norwegian? 2) Do the characters know they have the thing inside them or are they not conscious of it at all? 3) Was there more than one thing inside the characters? 4) At what point does the American helicopter guy with the earring become the thing? 5) How does the thing ""infect"" people? Blood?Touch?Air? I give it a 6 out of 10 because I did like the drama, it was not boring at all and yes there was a lot of mystery....just too much mystery. I prefer my movies to make a little more sense than this one did. I guess I'll just have to rent the old version.",The Thing
387,sam-321-129561,Gorgeous monster movie; another great version,7,18 May 2012,"I'm surprised there haven't been more than three versions of this one, The Thing From Another World is up there with Dracula and Frankenstein in terms of quality. John Carpenter's 1982 version, however, was so pitch-perfect, and so close to pre-CG special effects perfection, that it seemed like you just couldn't top it! A new take on a classic tale for a new audience is always welcome in my book, though, provided they capture what made the previous version(s) special.A living 'Thing' from another world, recently excavated in Antartica, assumes human form and lurks amongst others, then splits, contorts and bursts open its human bodies in whatever way necessary to survive. Paranoia spreads, the cast never knowing who among them has been assimilated by this 'Thing'. The Thing acts as a remake for the newcomers, but also as a prequel for people familiar with John Carpenter's version, complete with homages to shots found in that film (even down to the placement of a bloody axe) and a mid-credits sequence leading right into it.The re-remake has been met with some anger on the internet due to its use of CG, after Carpenter's film wowed people so much with its real-life animatronic effects. The bizarre truth is that the majority of this version's effects shots are actually practical, with a bit of CG to smooth out the edges and to achieve a few of the things practical effects could not, Jurassic Park style. The fact that people have had trouble realising this is testament to just how far both types of effect have come. The 'transformations' here however are less visceral than they were in the 80s version, the bodies change shape and sprout tentacles and teeth without the gushing blood and pus from the 'original' and it gives the entire affair a 'cleaner' feel, where the monster is more of a marvel than a horror. I was also pleased to see that where CG is used here it really is used to its potential, creating some awesomely grotesque and agile creatures which move freely of any rigging or puppetry (and nobody's going to convince me that CG tentacles are any less believable than jerky green-screened stop motion).In fact, the most notable difference in this version is the pacing. Carpenter's film bided its time, steadily working on the paranoia, only pulling out the glorious effects in a few key scenes, whilst this 'Thing' wastes no time showing off what it can do. For me, the 'original' was too slow in many ways and in contrast I find this one a little too fast, and it almost feels over too soon. The all-male cast of the 'original' weren't the most compelling set of characters, many of them crude stereotypes shoehorned in to further fuel the rage with their testosterone, whilst this version brings in a more diverse group of people - Norwegians, Americans, Englishmen, young and old - and it benefits from it. Whilst you could argue that the heroine character is crammed in and given too much character strength to contrast with Carpenter's sausage-fest, but she's still strong and when wielding a flamethrower and calling the shots at times she almost has an Ellen Ripley vibe to her. It's also nice to learn a bit more about the 'Thing'; as great as the mystery of it all was in the 'original', it's refreshing to get a further look into the kind of world this being may have come from and the kind of technology that brought it here.Overall, a great monster movie and another great retelling of a classic, but probably better for newcomers than for people with fond memories of the previous version(s). Less tension and more 'BOO!', less revulsion and more awe, this is the 'accessible' version of The Thing.",The Thing

When I first started watching this movie I had higher hopes that it would have been better and a tad but scarier than it actually was. By the end of the movie I was very disappointed.The sum it all up, the movie was very predictable to say the least. I found myself jumping less than I should have been at the parts that were meant to make you scream and wet your pants.As for the special effects of the movie, I rather enjoyed these. They weren't bad but they could have been better. Could have been more gruesome and terrifying but overall they weren't bad or terrible.Personally I prefer horror movies to any other genre and when I see a movie that is meant to be horror and I'm not jumping out of my seat, I don't consider a very good horror movie unless you're filming a movie for a teenager who is getting to see their very first horror movie.In terms of buying it, I don't recommend it.

392,bd_gordon,"Best Sci-Fi ""Remake"" Ever!",10,30 December 2011,"So many sequels and prequels fall flat and fail to reach the originality of its predecessor - never mind reach its impact and longevity (i.e. the silly Star Wars I-III, Matrix 2-4, and Tim Burton's Batman series...) but the 2011 version of John Campbell Jr.'s 1938 short story, ""Who Goes There?"" aka ""The Thing"" is equally as original and entertaining as the 1982 John Carpenter version. I wondered how the prequel would tie in the continuity of certain scenes, such as the two faced duplicate in progress; the suicidal radio operator; the transition from the Norwegian science station to the American one... I was very happy with this prequel, though probably more intended to demonstrate its metal as a remake. It's not a perfect story and there are a couple noticeable errors (i.e. 2011 circa headphones in an early '80's setting) but this in no way detracts from the eye and ear candy that assails the senses with this well-produced film, which stands tall in its own right. Mary Winstead is not in enough movies; she has the lead role, but she plays it without coming across as the lead - the sign of a good actor with staying power. I hope to see her in more films, but for now, she is very interesting to watch in this fast-paced story. There are enough twists and turns to throw off the viewer from the perils of predictability, and both the visual and audio quality of the effects will not fail to please. If you like sic-fi and horror, and aren't embarrassed to enjoy even the B&W oldies-but goodies (such as Howard Hawks' 1951 first version of ""The Thing From Another World"") then you will thoroughly enjoy this remake. I only hope the Blu Ray version comes packaged with a cleaned up print of Hawks' original film...",The Thing

394,philip-baxter,A pointless rehash of the Carpenter version,3,13 April 2012,"John Carpenter's The Thing was that rarest of things, a remake which completely surpassed the original. It didn't just surpass it, it demolished it, and stands today as one of the greatest horror films of all time. It was a perfect mix of atmosphere, a feeling of total isolation, a great cast, an original premise, and outstanding effects. Oh, and a fantastic soundtrack and a great ending.The sequel has no atmosphere, no feeling of isolation, a mixed cast (some of the beardy Nords are great, the rest are absolutely hopeless), a premise copied wholesale from Carpenter's version (so much so it's a shot for shot remake at times), typical over the top, frenetic, forgettable, generic CGI effects, a bland soundtrack, and a terrible ending.It's a failure on every level and has no reason to exist. Just watch the amazing Carpenter version again instead, you'll enjoy it far more than this generic Hollywood action movie trash. The only part of this remake/prequel I enjoyed was the nod to the Carpenter version at the end, but only because it reminded me how superb that version is.",The Thing

The 'Thing' was really scary, but I felt it could have been scarier if it was animatronics not CGI like in the original film. But I'm a bit of a geek for things like that.Basically a Norwegian team of scientists make a discovery - a frozen life-form encased deep in the ice some way from it's spaceship. They take it back to base to run tests and that's when all hell breaks loose.There's some really gross bits in this film and people die in unusual and painful ways; mangled, half eaten and infected!

396,killswitch999,Thank you to the director of this movie.,10,19 December 2011,"This is a great movie. I was so worried that this movie was going to be bad, but I kept an open mind and am really satisfied. First of all if you are a fan of the 1980's ""The Thing"" (like me) then you will want to see this movie just because of the flashes of the great time you had watching the oldie will make you want more of the same, but with the help of some new technology. And this movie does not disappoint. As soon as I started watching this movie, I thought it was going to fail. Mainly because I recognized all of about 1 of the actors. Those no name actors did a dam good job, especially the lead actor who I was worried about the most. Kurt Russel was the man in the 80's version, and for him to be replaced by a woman... I was worried. But she KILLED it! Great job by her, whatever her name is. She made all the right expressions, hit all the right tones of voice at the right times, had a great script to read from, and did a great job in this movie overall. One of the coolest things (no pun intended) about this movie, is that it is a prequel. It is a prequel to the 80's version. And it is extremely accurate and for that I thank the director. Its as if this movie was released a year before the 80's version, except with way better technology and CGI backing it up. Yes the CGI effects are plentiful in this movie, and they are great. Simply a great script. and also I like how there are Americans, and there are Norwegians. Not just some nonsenseical Norwegian speaking English for no reason bull crap. They put Norwegian people who speak Norwegian, and American people who speak English. That is some great work by one of my new favorite directors. This movie easily could have been half-assed and milked just based off the success the Kurt Russel version had in the 80's, but no, they took the time to make one of the best movies of this year. I haven't even mentioned the ""Thing"" yet! It is great ! You will be guessing who is really an alien and whos really human the whole way through. And I actually cared about all of the no name actors throughout the movie. These no name guys and girls acted better than a lot of the old big names have recently (adam sandler...jack and jill... really?) This movie just felt ALIVE and really well done.

It had a good story and kept me interested the entire way through. Also it is very good as a prequel, and sets up perfectly for the 1982 classic. There lies the major problem.The Thing (2011) is very closely related to the old film which is in fact the sequel to this one. Many times throughout the film it constantly relates to what happens in the next film when the Americans go to look at the Norwegian base and fine the remains of the disaster. I would have thought of this one a lot more highly if they had not made an original, because there are so many things the same in the old one and this one. The new one however, does add better special effects as well as a lot of jump-scares. In the end I would say to give this film a go, but definitely to have the 1982 one as a preference for viewing over this one.",The Thing

Actually I think perhaps the alien who just just woken up, could be still learning as it goes. This is the prequel, so it is possible that the alien hasn't learnt how to attack humans when they are alone.I feel the prequel is very well made, in terms of acting, effects and storyline. I am a big fan of The Thing, and I am giving the prequel a rating of10/10. It is definitely worth of my time to watch, as I am scifi/horror fan.

399,dave-appleton-242-121346,Hideous!!,1,19 March 2012,"This movie sums up for me what Hollywood has become, all about selling a brand to the audience with cheap thrills and ultra low quality. Some of the people giving this movie a positive review in my opinion need their heads examining because it quite simply in the biggest load of tripe I have ever seen. I love Carpenters 1982 movie with its unique dark brooding, tension building soundtrack, great visuals and top quality believable acting. The prequel on the other hand has become completely devoid of any of these qualities and as such has degenerated into a brain dead teeny slasher movie!I mean seriously this is a joke of a movie and I am not exaggerating this is so poor it beggars belief. I mean the director claim to have been a massive fan of the 1982 movie and yet creates something which is laughable in the extreme. Firstly the CGI monster is not remotely scary in comparison to the fantastic anamatronic version in the 82 version. Even though you knew the 82 version was a puppet, it was really there, it was tangible!Secondly the monster now runs around on a killing spree, exposing itself! I mean come on Hollywood stop treating us like cattle who you enjoy taking our money from, at least give us a quality product that is faithful to the horror genre! The 82 version had the creature exposé itself in a strategic manner and to attack when necessary. This was the whole basis of the movie and this prequel destroys this unforgivably.There are many other massive flaws in this movie but I would be writing a rather large list if I went into detail but I would like to point out the subconscious reason the 82 version worked so well. It was related to the underlying chess metaphor in the movie. Watch the movie and you will understand its a big game of chess between McReady and the creature, remember McReady plays chess at the beginning of the movie. This is why the prequel is hollow compared to the 82 version as there are no underlying depths to the movie that play on the audiences subconscious.",The Thing
400,solidsnake1983,The Thing's that could of been...,6,13 February 2019,"Now I'm not gonna sit here and say this movie didn't have many flaws. Starting with the fact that it is more CGI than practical effects. John Carpenter really mastered his vision on what he wanted to build as a horror film.
Tension, paranoia and no doubt some of the most gross and horrific creatures in horror film making.What they failed to do in this movie were all those things I mentioned, instead ended up getting a straight to action gore fest with barely any character build up. I can't say it was a complete utter waste but more of a cool way to piece together the things that were shown in carpenters version that we never witnessed. SPOILERS!!!The monster that was burned and merged with another face. Who committed suicide in the comms room, and the obvious question how did this creature get loose. Obviously for the sake of science someone had to crack the ice box with a drill and dig it up for tests without proper quarantine procedures. Now I know some people were very disappointed and with reason they have every right, but when I consider a movie to be abysmal or in other lament terms a piece of crap I consider things such as acting, cinematography, score and story. I have to point out that the actors were pretty spot on, was the story amazing no, not even close to how suspenseful the carpenter version that gripped us from start to finish.In the end we were left off with the question, did we need a prequel. Were we better off left with our theories and questions or was it fair enough that we all did pondered these questions and were let down with what could of been another tensioned filled prequel. But instead ended with a film that couldn't compete with the cult classic and my favorite horror movie of all time.",The Thing
401,dan-421-105621,Passable but not a classic,5,10 March 2013,"I'm not going to deliver another plot synopsis. Instead I'm going to try and explain why I thought the prequel to the 1980's ultimate horror classic failed to cook at the same temperature.I appreciate that the John Carpenter movie was in itself a remake. However, in the context of this movie - it is the original & it's a classic. It was ground breaking & unique, delivering huge amounts of paranoid fear, driven by the intelligent body horror that consumed the stranded residents at the Antarctic base.The 2011 movie has all the same tools at its disposal and begins by showing some potential.The discovery of the UFO was well done. You can imagine a hapless science team being lead by their curiosity in to that kind of trouble.But the plot immediately becomes challenging because of the way that Dr Sander Halvorson was written. It is inconceivable that anyone of that professional standing could be so monumentally stupid & remain unchallenged by those around him. Immediately you're left thinking 'that just wouldn't happen' when they cut the alien from the ice / when they stick it inside the base camp / when they extract tissue samples / when they leave it unattended with the ice melting.My criticism here is that they needed a more convincing device to necessitate the extraction of the alien. Perhaps the ice shelf should have been unstable, forcing them to extract it or lose it forever in to the abyss.Regardless, when the alien becomes free for the first time, we get a few of the best moments in the film. The hunt for the alien, its subsequent discovery under the hut and the consumption of one of the members of the base makes for gruesome viewing. Yet it's here that we catch a first glimpse of another weakness that plagues the film. As the man (whose name escapes me) is harpooned and dragged to his death, the CGI tentacle just isn't convincing.The subsequent autopsy of the creature redeems the prospect of quality effects for a while though. The inner workings of the alien and what it had started to do to its hapless victim were really well realised - and it should have been from here that the intense paranoia of the movie began. Yet somehow it failed to ignite.The helicopter scene was nonsensical. Although the pilot decided to land and the creature failed to escape, I can't see how it would have benefited from bringing the helicopter down. This could have been realised in a more convincing manner for my liking.Regardless of my view on all these elements, the film really unravelled during the transformation of Juliette after she's seemingly cornered Kate Lloyd. What we see in the 'creature reveal' is the beginning of a very stock approach to it's design & delivery. All too often you'll find that you're staring at a creature with a huge mouth where the stomach should be and a barrage of tentacles whipping about.It only seems to deviate from this format on a couple of occasions. The double headed creature and how it becomes a double headed creature is powerful horror - but it really felt like a one off set piece. Whilst all this is going on, we have some abysmal 'hand centipedes' to deal with.For every ounce of horror the two headed creature delivered, these things managed to take it away. Poor, Scooby Doo like CGI with a 'face hugger' characteristic that was completely unnecessary.Eventually we have our final confrontation between Lloyd & the creature in the UFO. Here, the real horror is glut of CGI that makes up the Sanders monster. It simply fails to trick the eye in to believing that it's real. I could have been watching a game on the X-Box or PS3 as far as I was concerned.CGI is cost effective but it's not convincing.My final criticism is that the film really failed to capitalise on the claustrophobic environment and deliver the 'who's it' paranoia of the 80's movie. All the elements were there and the scenes written, yet there was just not enough tension to show that the characters realised the utter horror of their situation. This is huge failing of direction in a horror movie. It's a lazy assumption by the director that the viewer will realise it on their behalf because they can see the wider picture.The film is worth a watch but there's very little that's special, clever or unique about it.",The Thing
402,MasterBrock,The prequel fails to live up to the masterpiece.,6,14 October 2011,"Contains SPOILERS for those who have not watched John Carpenter's version.If you happen to speak Norwegian the initial mystery of John Carpenter's The Thing is instantly spoiled as the Norwegians scream ""It's not a dog. It's a thing. It's imitating a dog. It's not real. Get away idiots."" Coming into this film, the situation is similar in that all the mystery is gone for anyone who happens to know the plot of the original. From the get-go it is known what the thing is and how it behaves. The audience knows the Norwegian base will be destroyed and that the movie will likely end with two non-infected Norwegians failing to stop the thing from escaping.That's the major challenge that faces director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. To film a movie about the unknown while having virtually everything known. John Carpenter's version was a masterpiece of distrust and xenophobia, building a perfect pace with excruciating levels of thrills. In this day and age, where xenophobia is more prevalent than ever you would think that building and adding to these themes would be a knockout.This sadly is not the case.The prequel simply deploys red herrings and the mystery of ""infected vs. non-infected"" delves into bad slasher territory. A dart toss would be more accurate than trying to logically guess who is the creature. There is nothing new in terms of suspense and it fails to build on themes of humanity, xenophobia, and trust. Sadly its more action than thriller and by the end it really has worn itself out.About the only way this film meets and surpasses John Carpenter's is in the CGI and visual effects. The thing in this movie is brutal and the effects are even more disturbing. The special effects teams deserves credits for breaking out some of the most disturbing Lovecraftian images I can recall. Watching humans erupt into tentacled flesh beasts never crosses into the realm of unbelievable and almost always remains repulsive.Its hard to lay fault on this one. The script wasn't impressive, the director certainly didn't help, and the actors definitely didn't shine. Trying to pick out one bearded character from another becomes fairly difficult, but even more so because there is no character development. Mary Elizabeth Winstead doesn't ever really command the lead and none of the other characters are even in the position to take the helm.In the end, its a CGI-driven action fest that in no real way honors the character-driven suspense of the original. Nothing new brought to the table aside from modern special effects. 6/10",The Thing
403,shermatz,The Complaints are SO Predictable!,8,23 October 2011,"I'm reluctant to thrust myself into the cauldron of savage ""film experts"" who will throw their drinks in my face if I disagree with their spittle-spewing invective about the 2011 ""The Thing"". HOWEVER--this was a fine remake and fans of the 1982 version should certainly not pass it up. Let me mention that even though I had read John Campbell's ""Who Goes There"" (the source for all film versions) I was NOT prepared for the horror shock of the 1982 Carpenter movie. I have to admit it positively SCARED ME SPITLESS like no movie before or since.So of course I was eager to see this 2011 ""redo"", my speculation being that the new CGI technology could juice up the monster terror. Indeed it did! Of course it didn't have the sting of the '82 version, where we did not know when, where or how the ""Thing"" would strike; but the monster jack-in-the-boxes in this new version (when they were sprung) were convincing and appropriately gruesome. It is impossible to top Carpenter's original since he was the first to bring this level of INTENSE paranoia and fear to the screen. Again, we all knew what was coming in the new movie, so it had MUCH less impact. But still--SO well done! I for one am not going to slag this redo simply because the studio had the temerity to attempt a sequel. It's tiresome, really, the feral invective ""fans"" display for ANY remakes, and begs the question in my mind--given the hysterical carping they inspire--WHY would any studio WANT to attempt a remake of ANYTHING?""Thing"" 2011 will never overshadow the '82 version, but it's still a worthy (and scary) movie.",The Thing
404,chodkoel,**SPOILERS** I am shocked...,4,20 October 2011,"...Shocked that this film is currently rated at 6.7. It is becoming increasingly difficult to take ratings seriously on this site. Considering that Dog Soldiers, for example, is rated as 6.8 - it is beyond my ken as to how this mediocre film can end up near a rating of 7.0. Even when taken as a stand alone film and not a remake, it doesn't contain enough elements to add up to an average 6.7 rating.Anyway, for those who have no experience with John Carpenter's 1982 version of the 1951 original, The Thing From Another World, I can understand how they may be impressed with the movie. The story is great. It's an absolutely fantastic concept. That's why it's somewhat offensive to me that Heijningen and company could be handed a golden goose and, in turn, give it such a thoughtless and sterile treatment.First, I'm not buying the relationships among the scientists. I mean, these are people that have traveled to Antarctica, are holed up in close quarters, have in their possession the greatest find in the history of the world, and seem to have about as much chemistry as a bunch of 5-year-olds at a Easter photo shoot. I didn't give a good damn about anyone. Actually, the only one that I really connected with at all was the one dude that couldn't speak any English. He seemed to me to be the most genuine actor of the lot. Most of the acting was mediocre at best, as if the actors and actresses had difficulty inserting themselves into the story in such a way as to produce a visceral performance. Part of the problem is that the film moves along too quickly. They could have spent a little less time showing scenery and shots of the monster and invested more into character development.Which leads into the next problem. I expected to feel more of a sense of claustrophobia but most of the shots were way too expansive. The camera work really ruins the film. I mean, they're in freaking Antarctica, packed like sardines in a tin can, and freaked out of their gourds. I felt more tension watching The Muppet Christmas Carol. And that's why The Thing doesn't work as a slasher flick, like it was portrayed. Giving the movie that type of treatment guts the film of what's most effective: the Man vs. Man element.Thirdly, there are way too many shots of the monster. It's gratuitous and detracts from the mystery and suspense. In the end, the monster comes off as being clumsy and inefficient.In my mind, movies rated above, say 5.0, are films that I would consider watching again. Having said that, there is no chance that I would ever watch this film again. I can't give this film much higher than a 4.5, maybe 4.6. To really break it down into simple terms, it lacks the ""coolness"" factor where I might say to myself, ""Boy I'd really like to see this scene again or hear this dialogue."" There's nothing I want to revisit in this movie.The best parts of the movie were the fillings test and the end, when they showed the beginning of the 1982 version.In conclusion, go ahead and watch the movie, but don't lose the ability to view a film with a critical eye because it's loaded with CGI. As for me, I'll be watching Carpenter's masterpiece again the next chance I get.",The Thing

I don't need to say a gratuitous amount about the film, because if you're at all familiar with it's premise as well as John Carpenter's film then you should probably have an idea. If not, go research them both.I'm a big fan of John Carpenter's film, so when I heard Hollywood was producing a prequel, I was both skeptical and curious. John Carpenter's film is a near masterpiece, so most fans would probably have mixed feelings about a new film.I saw this prequel opening weekend and I honestly walked out satisfied. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it certainly manages to pull off what it intends to do. Some of the scares are cheap, as well as the CGI, and most of the characters are very underdeveloped but all in all, it's a solid monster flick that keeps you guessing, just like the original.It's definitely a solid companion piece to the original, like some reviewers have been saying.

I have no idea why some of these other reviews HERE claim that it's not a prequel. This version of THE THING both sets up and ends right where the (1982) THE THING begins. It's a great story with wonderful special effects and good graphics. Although I must admit John Carpenter's monsters where much more real. You could see, hear, and sometimes actually feel the slime oozing off the Carpenter creatures. This film doesn't have the slime feeling, or, it does, but it's computer slime, not the real thing. There are fantastic scenes all over this film so pay attention. I thought that the music could have used some help. Listen for yourself. There's not much of a soundtrack. This film might have benefited from a Howard Shore type score. Other than that it's fine. Totally Worth Seeing!",The Thing
407,forever_bonkers,A good nod to the original film.,7,19 May 2020,"This film is a prequel to the original film with Kurt Russel. It's not as good because in my eyes the original is a masterpiece of cinema, but it is a very good film worthy of what came before. The acting is good and the film is shot really well. The story is well thought out and is a good beginning as a prequel to it original, i mean the film literally ends in the same scene at the original films starts. You cant get more immersive than that.One of my favourite things about this film is that they made an effort to use animatronics like the original film used so its not all CGI. That's a loving homage to the original because they could of easily gone full CGI like most modern films these days. My only criticism about the films is that it could of been longer, there are a couple of parts that felt a bit rushed. But on the whole the story does have a good flow to it.If you like the original, if you like horror, if you like good special effects you should enjoy this film. Take a chance.",The Thing

A failure in all realms of movie making known to the fans of the original masterpiece.The movie opening is promising and the backdrop looks breathtaking as you pass the first 10 to 15 minutes the storyline goes south and shows no sign of recovery after 40 minutes are passed in the movie. The background score is the only aspect that tries to seize your attention with a few collapses of its own. The visuals are less than impressive and fails to thrill you once the extra-terrestrial is revealed. Performance are overall marginal and expressing mediocrity complimenting the poor editing of scenes. All this coupled with a fairly decent direction attempt to undertake a great piece of original work was overall poorly executed. I do not recommend this prequel as its a distant dream in storytelling from the original and leaves zero impact.",The Thing

As with the original ""The Thing"" this prequel works on our keeping an interest in what the characters are up to, and we can never be too sure. I have just finished watching the film, and the one thing that I am more aware of (than the 1982 film) is that ""the thing"" (whatever it is, and wherever it comes from) is certainly a scampy little ball of Intelligence - it pits itself against the human, and also the filmic spectator, as we must always be thinking...""hm...what is it up to now?""We are never too sure, and there are many puzzles to work out...Enjoy.",The Thing
411,jdonahue444,The Thing may seem awesome but its disappointing,6,29 October 2011,"The thing looked pretty cool in the trailer and it's no surprise that another remake of a classic horror movie was coming out. I thought that since we had new technology the thing would be so cool and don't get me wrong the effects wee pretty cool but that was it. There was no character development. All it was was the thing switching from body to body in-which the body would be burning to death. It's also not gory, I can barley remember blood spewing everywhere. But there are a lot of disturbing images when one of the people were changing into the thing. It defiantly showed us the death of horror right there in front of us. There was no element of surprise you could practically see everything coming. the creators just kept recycling the same scenes over and over, just people burning to death. and the end credits i guess it was suppose to tie in the other movie but i didn't get it so to me the ending was disappointing to. So if you are looking to jump a few times in the theater or wanting to see twisted pictures, i recommend this movie, but if your looking for a movie with character development and a good plot line and something with a huge twist at the end i recommend saw or dead silence not the thing.",The Thing

This is a very classic prequel movie , no much effort for the plot. I try to watch this movie just like any other science fiction movie , and i have to say they did a pretty good job introducing the universe already used once to a fresh audience , Acting performances were quite good enough to keep it serious , this is actually entertaining and any people fan of genre or not should give a try .Although the story itself is facing some major incoherences and anachronisms which is unacceptable when we talk about science-fiction genre . The cgi effects were good but really overdone and overused like they had to prove a point or even hide some flaws (like in the scenario ?).

413,Hausmannsgate,"Lost potential, but worth a viewing",6,8 December 2011,"I am not a huge fan of horror movies, but I can definitely enjoy horror when it's done right. ""The Thing"" from 1982 is a good example of horror done right. When I first heard about this project I was excited. In the first part of ""The Thing"" (1982) the main characters travel out to a deserted Norwegian research base to find out what happened there. The set design was perfectly conceived. To this day I think a lot of fans of the original find this very part among the most memorable. It really gets your imagination going and you continuously ask yourself: ""what horrible things happened here?!"" And that is exactly what the prequel is about; what did indeed happen to the Norwegians? It might be argued that this was a stupid topic for a film, as then its no longer a mystery. But that's a different discussion. I still think it's a cool idea for a project. However, when I went to see this film I didn't have a lot of expectations. Firstly because I can't think of a single frightening monster/horror film made in the last decade. That alone spoke against this project. I also knew that the writers had written in some mainstream characters in order to make the film more agreeable for the average audience, which I will come back to later. My first thought after seeing the film was that it's not bad though. It's not really good, but it's enjoyable, especially if you haven't seen the original. The film's qualities lie in it's superb action/thriller scenes, which are almost identical to the ones in the original 1982 film. Plagiarizing some might say. As a fan boy, I would say that's exactly what we wanted. Another quality in this film is it's attempts to make tribute to the original. Great care is put in to telling us the story behind every little detail we see in the set of the original, which is really cool. Sadly, the film also has its fair share of flaws. It's biggest problem, like so many horror films made today, is that it fails realize that no matter the considerable amounts blood and gore, shaky camera effects and high paced music you pour in to the mix, it's not really going to be a fraction as scary as the unknown. Blood and gore can be used to great effect to hint our imagination at how horrible a thing that lurks in the dark, but it will never make a film scary by itself. The filmmakers just fail to play with out imagination. It might be argued that even the original version of The Thing did too little to play with our imagination, but it had great character development and old fashioned special effects to boot. A second problem with the film is it's rather implausible mix of characters. The main heroin is a beautiful, American scientist. The idea of putting in this character just stinks of trying making the film more friendly to the average audience. Of course, it's Hollywood, so they need to follow certain norms to make money from their films, but at some point it just makes for a bad movie. Which is really stupid, because then you are definitely not going to get your money back. I don't really have anything against amazons in horror films; it worked great in Alien, but The Thing (1982) is infamous for it's lack of female characters and the prequel should have followed in it's path. An all-male setting, isolated at that, may also serve to write in some enjoyable gallows humor and shallow masculinity, which fits perfect for horror films. It can be frightening to see these masculine environments fall victim to pure terror.There is also a bunch of other American and a British characters in the film, and what was originally supposed to be an all-Norwegian camp ends up being this multicultural thing, with the Norwegians themselves left standing somewhat in the background to be eaten. This doesn't really fit well with how the camp is perceived in the original film. A better and arguably more successful film would have offered an all-male, all-Norwegian set of characters, consisting of mostly bizarre, masculine bearded types. The obvious choice would be to hire an all American cast, let them speak English, and just pretend that they are Norwegian. It's been done plenty of times before. K-19 immediately comes to mind. Finally the film should have been darker, better paced and have more character development. The fact that they are in a hostile environment like Antarctica is very poorly conveyed. Even in the hottest months of the year the average high on the South Pole is – 26 degrees Celsius, yet here we see our heroes walking around in thin jackets, sometimes without caps, as if it's no problem at all. Some of the characters are even sitting and chilling outside! And way too often the characters appear clean, comfortable and warm, when they should be drenched in frost, ash and appear to be freezing their buts off. It should also be mentioned that some parts of the film don't take place in Antarctica at all, which somewhat ruins the feeling of isolation.To summarize, this film is worth a viewing, but it could have been so much better. If you haven't seen the original you could perhaps see them both in concession, to great effect, because the very best part of this prequel is it's last two minutes, ending exactly where the original picks up. It immediately made me want to see the original again.",The Thing

This prequel isn't as bad as I may have thought but it really is pointless. If you watched this movie first then watch Carpenters version then the 82 version doesn't make sense! Why would the Thing make the SAME mistakes that got it caught out at the Norwegian camp? The film starts well, but goes downhill quickly-why get an American expert from 10,000 miles away when you may have one in the US camp (Or the never mentioned until convenient Russian camp?) sorry nitpicking-damn! But that is the problem with this film, there is no suspense, no character development (ok even Carpenter didn't do so well there either but at least I knew who everyone was) and the effects! Oh god some of the CGI was out of a syfy monster movie of the week! There is so much wrong with this film that it spoils the things that go well (other effects are pretty cool when done well). The main problem is no attempt is made to make you think ""which one is The Thing?"" -and it wouldn't have mattered anyway as one beardy Norwegian bloke looks pretty much like another beardy Norwegian bloke-oh there is two women, our lead-Sorry but she's no Ripley (I'll just drop this flamethrower down, my only form of defence or keeping warm, right here). The other woman is totally wasted, like the time I spent watching this movie. I promised this was a review-sorry just couldn't resist those nitpicks.

417,aleapug,A weak prequel to a great movie,4,2 August 2013,"When i heard there would be a prequel to John Carpenter's classic ""The Thing"", i was pretty excited, but also worried. I felt that there would be plot errors, and the effects would be weak. I was also worried that it would bomb, but i hoped for the best. After watching it, i was pretty disappointed. I am a huge sci-fi film fan going back to watching films from the 60's in modern day 2013. I always love a good, well thought out sci-fi flick. Unfortunately, some of the errors i had been worried about above were definitely evident in the film. The effects were actually okay, and did not completely take over the entire movie. Unfortunately, ""The Thing'' contained a lot of plot errors.First off, it is stated in the movie that they say they are only 50 miles away from a Russian base. Well, wouldn't they have thought (especially MEW's character!) to go to the base at all for help or even reach them. They did not try to reach them really at all in the movie. That and i am not sure, but the whole organic thing about metal fillings and clothes being a difference.....i'm not 100% sure it's an error, but it is just ridiculously to confusing for this movie. I understand everything perfectly in the original.The worst flaw in the whole movie to me is that the character's are completely unrelatable, and i did not really feel bad when they were killed off. They were not developed fully enough, and there wasn't much emotion to almost everyone. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character was the only character that i actually cared about. The rest were underdeveloped to me.On a positive note, the effects were pretty good as i stated above. There were some great mysteries and the film did a good job of creating some suspense. The ending was a bit weak, but it was one of the only parts i understand that would soon lead to the beginning of the 1982 classic.Finally, this prequel is a weak effort that does have some good moments, but pails in comparison to the sci-fi classic in 1982.

So instead of doing the typical thing of this generation and ""rebooting"" a series/film, they did something classy- they expanded on a story. And they pulled it off exceptionally well. Yes, this movie has MUCH more CGI effects, but it wasn't overboard. The tie-ins to Carpenter's version are spot on. Set designs were great. The acting went way beyond my expectations- Winstead was amazing as the lead. The story was tight.

It's simply a homage to John Carpenter's movie, and a story made for all the fans who since 1982 wondered what really happened at the Norwegian Research Station.We've already seen the Thing and what it can do, in the first movie, so of course we don't get the same element of surprise while watching this prequel. We know what to expect. The only thing left unanswered is what really happened. Does this automatically make it a bad movie? No, I don't think so.The Thing (1982), is better than The Thing (2011)..but that's only because of Kurt Russel, and the fact that the concept of the ""Thing"" itself was something new back then, and never seen before.Anyway: If you're a hardcore fan of John Carpenter's movie, you definitely should check out this one as well (if only for the back story).",The Thing

Um, strike that, Reverse it",7,17 October 2011,"I find it difficult to fathom what fan as fanatical as I am of the original, er, 1982 John Carpenter film wouldn't have a blast with this update/remake/prequel. I hereby coin the term ""premake."" You're welcome. From this reviewers estimation, and I estimate quite a bit, there are so many well-conceived details at work within this picture that hearken back to the OBVIOUSLY admittedly superior Carpenter version; they tie the two films together so well that, if deciding to watch this one first, one can seamlessly branch its sequel (the one from 1982 not from 1951, let's forget that one for now; DO try and keep up!) and by the conclusion of Kurt Russel's adventure all of your questions and curiosities will be satisfied. The really only knock against this risk- taking (in that its risky to mess with what is so seemingly ""beloved"" a property as John Carpenter's ultimate paranoiarctic classic of a movie) picture is that's it's unavoidably unnecessary. That's a substantial knock, as being a film that ONLY entertains, in this case within a familiar-yet-alien world (more familiar to those who have seen Carpenter's a few dozen times, I'm sure) should surely not be enough, should it? I will answer my own question with an answer: it most certainly should. Interesting leaps are taken, unknowns are explained, though not to the detriment of the suspense from 1982, and the audience is treated to as satisfying a ""Who Goes There?"" yarn as anything horror's had to offer in years. Comparisons are unavoidable but of course they are; this movie exists to evoke memories of the original (there I finally called it that), pay it homage, and take audiences on a similar-but-different ride. Just because we know how it ends doesn't mean we can't enjoy the thrills! Recommended, and most especially to those of us who love John Carpenter's The Thing.",The Thing
424,flaviofoglia,Worthwhile prequel,8,16 May 2014,"When I found out that the prequel of one of my favourite movies came out, I was excited and worried at the same time due to the mixed reviews. But I'll tell you, actually this movie pleasantly satisfied me. While it has its flaws, it's actually a coherent and well tied prequel, which temporally ends exactly when the original movie starts.The scientific aspects of ""The Thing"" are developed more deeply, and we learn how this creature actually lives and replicates. Science geeks like me will find this quite interesting and realistic: The Thing hasn't got a ""real"" shape, but it actually is a cellular-based organism capable of cloning host cells, and trigger mutations when necessary (such as when it needs to attack and assimilate someone).The Norvegian Base camp is recreated in the smallest details, and I appreciated the fact that we also get to see inside the spaceship. I mean, after watching the original film I was perplexed that we've got both a spaceship with its door open, and a team of scientists, and nobody seems to care about entering inside the spaceship and analyze it?Flaws of this movie include some weak acting and no character development, and the helicopter scene CGI effects (who has seen the movie will remember it) which I found ridiculous, but fortunately in most of the other scenes we get well made CGI and practical effects, both kinda impressive. Also I didn't like the director's choice near the end (I bet almost anybody would have preferred the Alien Pilot version!! Instead of that shitty pixelated cover which felt nonsense and cheap).I suggest you not to listen to the people whining on any cult-classic remake which comes out, first because this is a prequel and NOT a remake, second because it seems that aforementioned people can't distinguish between a good or bad prequel/sequel/remake when it comes after a lot of time (30 years in this case), they should understand that a change of style after such a timespan is normal. Nevertheless this movie is much similar to the original (a team of scientists isolated in an Antarctica base camp, paranoia derived from inability to trust anyone, flamethrowers which will ignite entire buildings, tests to determine if someone is infected or not etc.) and should satisfy enough anyone who doesn't whine on any new cult-classic remake.So, nothing groundbreaking and we pretty much know already what to expect from this movie at the beginning; but at the end I was pleased to discover that all my expectations were met.",The Thing
425,DaveMuto,"Not without it's flaws, but still damn good. (SPOILERS!!)",7,12 April 2012,"I'm writing this as a die hard fan of John Carpenter's remake of the 50's classic, both of which stemmed from John W. Campbell's short story/novella ""Who Goes There?"" (the 80's version and this version paid much closer attention to the book then the 50's one.) So, with that in mind, I'll talk about what obviously drives the whole story, the characters.You're not supposed to feel particularly invested in characters whom, once the movies arc begins to rise might not be who/what they appear to be. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character was fine, but her arc ends on a sour note for me. After everything is set up for the 80's movie to take place and the prequel aspect of this movie ends, we delve further into the characters who are left; Mary Elizabeth Winstead's, Joel Edgerton's, and Ulrich Thomsen's. Ulrich's character as the Norwegian scientist who wants to keep the alien alive for scientific research (even before it possesses him) is an homage to the 50's version, since in the 80's remake, once the beast made its second killing, everyone, even the scientists, wanted it dead. Kudos to the screenwriters for throwing that in; it didn't add terrible amounts of depth to the characters, but it certainly was more than was expected. Joel Edgerton's character did a great job as the American pilot who just wanted the hell outta there, but also, to do the right thing and finish off the monster. His military background and overall participation in fighting The Thing before it tries to escape was very believable and fit perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character obviously runs the show; discovering aspects of how The Thing transforms, what it leaves behind (anything artificial; the fillings concept was spot on,) and of course, her ability to assume control over the entire operation was impressive. However, when the ship is blown up, and she kills Edgerton once she realizes he's a monster, her arc flat-lines. We see her get into the other functioning car, the camera slowly zooms in, and then fades out. We have no idea what happens to our heroine! We can assume she died in the car, or that she went to the Russian camp Edgerton mentioned before they went after Thomsen's character. The only problem with her going to the Russian camp is, even with the cold war going on at the time, could she not have warned them about the monster and potentially brought in a whole other group of people to the Norwegian camp before the Americans found it? Too much ambiguity, especially in a characters resolution, can lead to massive amounts of frustration, I know it did for me.So, there's the good and the bad, but there is one gem of a character who made the movie great for me. The simple, almost silent (might as well be since he couldn't speak English,) and ever determined to kill The Thing once he sees what it can do, the white knight in a simple man's clothing, Lars. His one track mind complements Edgerton's in terms of a lack of a scientific background, but a determination to do what he considers the right thing, and contrasts enough with Winstead and Thomsen's intellectual background make him the character you'll find yourself rooting for. If you don't, you will when you see the end credits.This movie is not bad, it's not fantastic, but if you've got a free night and want to check out a movie with mixed reviews, check out this one and see if you swing with the haters or the lovers, or end up like me, perfectly content in the middle and satisfied with the job they did.",The Thing

They had 29 years to review John Carpenter's masterpiece, and still couldn't get the prequel to link up properly with the 82 version.The lack of suspense, the addition of Americans to what was supposed to be an all Norwegian cast, the changing of the Thing from a creature that hides to one that rampages, the bad CGI, the continuity errors, and the fact that several scenes were obvious ripoffs from Carpenter's all add up to turn what could have been a great movie into another typical Hollywood remake calling itself a prequel.The Norwegians were great, and the sets were very well done. The outdoor scenes were terrible though. It was ridiculous to show people casually sitting outside chatting and drinking coffee without any kind of head and face protection in Antarctica. It ruined the cold isolated atmosphere immediately.I heard about the prequel and was very excited to see it, but now I wish I hadn't bothered. This movie is a pale imitation of what it could have been.",The Thing
430,fireof1989,The ultimate in Alien mediocrity.,5,27 December 2011,"If you are a fellow horror fan, there really isn't any point bringing up the fact that John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is a golden oldie and a classic for the ages - you already know that. So what about the weird pseudo-remake/attempt at a prequel? To be honest, the film is just.... meh. When it comes to horror remakes though, that's actually faint praise. I'm not going to lash out against this one like I've lashed out (numerous times) against remakes such as The Hitcher, A Nightmare on Elm St. and so on. If anything, I'll just forget that this one exists. I'll give it this: It does not insult the status of the original, but nor does it compliment it.Which is a shame, because the film so desperately *wants* to compliment the original and to be fair, there are a couple things that work. I'll give it this, it does have some of the atmosphere that the original carried - the antarctic tundra still feels real, still feels desolate, and the setting can still instill a sense of paranoia. But the fact is that it's just too familiar, and there are many chinks in the films armour that reduce the films atmosphere. If the films writers had spent less time rehashing ideas from the original, had the actors put on a better facade, and the effects looked believable then maybe - just maybe, this could have worked. But there in lies the problem, that ""better movie"" already exists.See, a lot of people forget this - but the 1982 version of ""The Thing"" was itself a remake and in some weird way, even moonlighted as a minor sequel to the 1950s classic ""The Thing from another World."" It wasn't a full on sequel, but there were nods to the original (Including footage) that were more than just references or attempts to actually masquerade as a remake and not a re-adaptation, so that makes the 1982 version of the film a lot like the 2011 version - it is a film attempting to reinterpret a classic, while keeping lingering ties to the original. But the 1982 version succeeded, and the 2011 version fails. It shows that it cares about the original and does no harm to the original either, but it lacks the effort and spirit that Carpenter gave in his 1982 picture - and it was that effort and spirit that made it the classic it is today. Watch that instead.",The Thing

All too often, movie fans see one great film, are amazed by what they see, expect the same quality from the next film, and are disappointed. Not with this one! I would say that this prequel is slightly better than the movie that was made in 1982. I appreciate the fact that the story line is consistent and matches up with the 1982 movie. There's never a dull moment in this movie. You are always engaged in the fascinating storyline. A major plus is that this prequel provides the viewer with a lot of storyline info that was not available in the 1982 film (since the 1982 film takes place later in the storyline). The video editing for this movie was also very good. The Thing is much more realistic in it's appearance. Definitely a must see! You won't be disappointed!",The Thing
433,fchriskoch,Just watched the NEW Thing prequel to The Kurt Russell Thing that was a sequel to The Original Thing,6,15 December 2011,"Well Hellooo! Just watched the thing and of course like anyone that knows about this im a fan of the Kurt Russell/Carpenter 80's classic. That movie still has some of the best robot gore/makeup scenes I can think of. Love the part with the dogs in the cage when Thing first reveals itself,,,especially when the dog is trying to bite through the fence in sheer terror. If you've never seen it,,,,definitely worth a watchAnyways on to the new prequel that i surprisingly enjoyed. Enjoyed is a strong word though. What i mean by enjoyed is that i actually watched the entire movie and didn't throw something at my TV. Nowadays with all the sequel/prequel trash thats being made you have to be careful about what you waste two hours of your life on.Pretty much the same storyline as the ""Snake Plisskin"" version Scientists in Antartica for no apparent reason find an alien ship buried under the ice for thousands of years then an alien comes out and can morph into any living thing. cool thing is that the thing unleashes vomit inducing scenes of violence whenever it reveals itself and KILLS!!!main difference of course is gone are the days of bad ass Stan Winston effects and now we get to watch cg scenes that nerdy college kids made in 5 months. still there are a few ""WHOA!"" moments but the acting is pretty flat and there's this redhead Norwegian guy that has the same wide eyed look through the whole movie. The chick is OK but she turns out to be the main bad ass and all the scientists guys are kinda just being bossed around by her. America,,,,F YEA!!!The great thing about the carpenter version was also the acting between the characters and the felling of isolation and paranoia with a dangerous entity in the midst. you don't really get that feeling in this version. guess the acting and the music didn't have the same effect on the audience in the new one. Its worth a watch with some friends or you girl or boyfriend but I would never watch it again on purpose. I would sit and watch it in silence if a friend popped it in but would like having to sit through it again......this would be a redbox",The Thing
434,rockykoston,A good Movie and a genuine Prequel,7,26 December 2011,"**This may contain few spoilers** I came to know that this movie is a Prequel to the 1982 ""The Thing"" so I sat down to watch the first movie, which is indeed a very good thriller. After watching that part I was intrigued ""What happened at the Norwegian Camp? What was that Alien Ship? Where did the Thing come from?"" and then I sat to watch this movie and it is very interesting. The way the new movie leaves the clues found in the 1982 movie. The action sequences are good and the CGI is above normal. There are no cheap thrills and in fact as a standalone, this is a good sci-fi thriller.The concept may not be original well, its not intended to be, but there are sequences which are very unique to this movie. There is tension in the camp, a freaking fever going all around and everyone does a fairly good job of holding onto their roles. The acting is pretty good overall. This movie definitely deserves an 7 if not more, for building on its predecessor and bringing new ideas. I am expecting another part maybe the Russians (probabaly the camp where Mary Winstead might go) can dig into the Alien Ship and find more interesting facts. Anything is possible.. this is a genuinely good prequel :)",The Thing
435,nightwatch_32,A tribute to John Carpenter,9,6 February 2012,"If something is good to recognize, is what other directors have done in previous years. This film is really a tribute to John Carpenter, in every way. Each take remembers the movie 1982, so much so that in the scene in which Lars burns with the flame thrower to the thing, immediately recalls Kurt Russell doing the same in the previous version. Here we can not talk remake, is clearly a prequel, which explains the origin of the story, and so well taken care of the details in every way, the ice cube that remains after the escape of alien, the creature with two heads is burned in the ice, in Carpenter's film is found by the Americans, until the letters of the helicopter. I did the exercise to see The Thing, 1982, immediately after that of 2011, and it is impressive how well they match the two movies. It is fully recommended for fans of the genre and for those who want to see a real tribute to Carpenter and one of his best films, if not the best.",The Thing
436,reingp,Should not just compare to the first one,9,23 February 2015,"OK, not as remarkable as the '82 version, but still a good and enjoyable movie.Most complaints as I see, regards to the use of CGI instead of practical effects. I do agree that maybe the use of mechanical things could give us the feeling of reality a bit better, adding to the thrill and tension of the moment. But, on the other hand, the CGI was well done (except the Griggs part), but not a B movie.The major plot hole, imo, was the final part when Kate and Sam-thing are coming out of the spaceship, then she torches it inside the mobile. The Sam-thing had a good opportunity to kill her and did not, they were alone. Also, when did the thing kill Sam in first place? And his clothes are in one piece...Well, besides that part, the plot was OK and consistent with its sequel. And the atmosphere of being remotely located in an place with no escape with people you can't trust, knowing that some of them want to kill, absorb you, is well kept.So, not a A+ movie, but a decent one. I just love the ""The Thing"" story so much and I wish they would continue it with another film.",The Thing
437,dusterbomb,Mediocre and inconsistent,4,3 April 2015,"Not very good. This movie is supposedly a prequel to John Carptenter's classic ""The Thing"", from 1982. 1982's The Thing was a horror classic. It had subtlety, fantastic atmosphere, memorable characters, a brilliant setup, and knew exactly how to make the ""monster"" not only scary, but smart and mysterious. For these reasons, it is unfortunate this film labeled itself as a prequel, because 2011's The Thing ignores everything that made the 1982 film so great and instead ended up being a muddled, mediocre mess. Since this movie is a prequel, one would expect that plot elements would carry over from this movie to 1982 in a logical way. Not so. Anyone who has seen the 1982 film knows that it was the Norwegians who initially discovered The Thing frozen in the ice and unleashed it upon the world inadvertently. At the beginning of 1982, Norwegians are seen chasing a dog that is actually The Thing into the American base, resulting in both of their deaths due to the fact that they could not speak English and communicate with the Americans. The problem with this? EVERYONE BUT ONE GUY can speak English in the 2011 movie. That makes no sense! Neither of the surviving Norwegians spoke English, so why is it that everyone in THE PREQUEL can speak English fluently except for one guy? This doesn't make sense because the events of the 1982 film happened partially because the Norwegians couldn't speak English. Now, they suddenly can in the 2011 film? It's inconsistent and illogical. Yes, I understand that having a bunch of people speaking Norwegian would be a bit off- putting to English audiences, but ignoring that inconsistency makes the entire movie not make sense!Now, regarding the monster; The Thing in the 1982 film was smart, intelligent, and did everything it did to survive. It wouldn't pointlessly attack people in big groups where it would get outnumbered unless it had no other choice, it attacked people when they were most vulnerable and alone, and it always behaved in a way that would benefit its attempt to survive. This is not the case in 2011. There's a scene at the beginning of the movie where The Thing reveals its form in a helicopter when it isn't threatened and is surrounded by 3 other people who aren't infected. Question: WHY? Why would it thoughtlessly destroy an easy escape to the rest of human civilization (which is exactly what The Thing wants to do by the way!) and reveal itself like that? It's a virus. It wants to spread and assimilate. It makes absolutely no sense for it to reveal itself when it isn't being threatened and it can't logically assimilate anyone without being caught. It doesn't make any sense and it's inconsistent with the behavior already established in the 1982 film. Yes, it's a prequel, but its motives don't change from one film to the other. It has the same goal and wants the same thing, so this scene is completely nonsensical and seems to only exist to show off the (lousy) CG they used for the monster. There's a few more inconsistencies I want to point out before I end this review. First, the way the spaceship crashed doesn't make any sense. At the beginning of the movie, you see 3 men in a vehicle drive over the crash site of The Thing's spaceship. They fall through the crack formed by the ice due to the entry of the spaceship and stop a good 100 feet short of the spaceship. There are two problems with this. One, the way they stopped doesn't make any sense. They stopped due to friction between their vehicle and the sides of the ice chasm. This doesn't really make any sense, because the force caused by gravity should have been enough to force the vehicle to slide completely through. But it didn't. It wedged in the chasm, which isn't logically possible. It's unrealistic and took me out of the movie instantly. Secondly, the way they spaceship is positioned in the ice makes no sense. If the spaceship collided with the ice sideways, perpendicularly. Since this is the case, the ship should be lodged into the ice perpendicularly to the surface of the Earth, right? Nope. It's positioned parallel. How did it get like that? There's no way the ship could have crashed through the ice and then did a 90 degree rotation in less than half a second to land flat into the ice and not on its side. It doesn't make any sense. These last few occur at the end of the movie. First, why couldn't The Thing reach Kate around the corner? It can take basically any form it wants and can separate into parts at any moment, so why wouldn't it do that to reach her? It makes zero sense for her to be inches out of reach of her when it can detach itself like it did earlier in the movie several times. Secondly, it was established previously that The Thing could meld with organisms simply by touching them. I know this because one of the characters was fused with by the Thing when the creature pressed a deformed faced to the person, and their cells fused together. With this in mind, why was Kate not assimilated when she was dragged through the pipe? It touched her. I saw it! She should have been assimilated right there. To back that up, she even told Carter not to touch an ax that had been used to cut an infected Thing arm in half. This was because it was covered in The Thing's blood, which risked him being assimilated on contact. Which means The Thing touching her should have assimilated her. To summarize, The Thing (2011) does not live up the 1982 film, there are a lot of problems with it even as a standalone film, and overall it's just not very good.5/10.",The Thing
438,Diego2001,Really awful !,1,16 October 2011,"This movie is really bad. I know that there has to be a suspension of disbelief, particularly for monster pictures in which a monster frozen for one hundred thousand years comes back to life. The original had it and so did the Kurt Russell remake but this one does not. A scientific research station in the Antarctic where the scientists are packing more guns than Rick Perry plus there are plenty of flame throwers around for everyone who wants to roast a monster. It is also getting tiresome that all space alien monsters, since ""Independence Day"" are slimy crab like creatures that are killing machines without ever bothering to communicate to us mere earthlings. Time for a new style alien!! Then the acting is dreadful and was there anyone actually directing this absolute rubbish?????",The Thing
439,wax69,don't even bother to go see this,1,2 February 2012,"it is amazing to me how badly they screwed this film up. it is a prequel which means you cant really go wrong with what happens in the movie unless you are utterly incompetent!! it is amazing how many different things they that were inconsistent with the 1982 ""the thing"" and i will get to those in a min. but first let me say that the movie itself was so fast pace and that there was no build up with character development and people started getting killed off really fast and there was no suspense quality to the film at all. it was like a bad ""b"" movie where an alien comes and kills a bunch of people in a scientific research station !now for those of you who have seen the original 1982 version here is where you will hate this movie so, just like the heading of my review Don't EVEN BOTHER TO SEE THIS MOVIE . first of all the inconsistencies .when you first meet the female main character she is using a flat panel computer with graphics clearly inconsistent with the time period. when they find the space ship in the ice obviously in the 1982 version you know that kurt russels crew watched a video tape that they found clearly showing the norwegians using thermite charges to melt the ice to get to the space craft. well not in the new one! they dug tunnels out under the ice to get to the ship!! then when the alien is in an ice block back at the base it finally comes out but in this one it barley even bothers to imitate anyone it just goes down the hallways and attacks people in its alien form. at least in the 1982 version it did its best to hide and replicate dogs or humans. then , and you will probably agree with this assessment if you actually watch the new one, in the last 10-15 min of the movie its like they were scrambling to tie in thing from the 1982 version. it was truly pathetic. they just show the body of the one guy which kurt russel finds that slit his own throat. then you see a helicopter just show up and find one of the characters that is alive that you never see die and the pilot has no idea whats going on. then all of a sudden during that scene a dog runs out of a window and the last survivor tells the pilot to chase after the dog. but here is the real kicker to how bad this movie is . the main girl character of the film at the end winds up back at the space craft with another male character to chase someone who they know is an alien to kill him and she ends up killing the guy who was helping her kill the alien (and in that scene , did kill the alien with a flame thrower) . so she was by herself in a snow vehicle and she drives off!!! they don't even explain what happens to her. she lives!! terrible movie . wish it had never been made!!",The Thing
440,michaeld-5,This movie fails to please in most areas,3,8 March 2012,"The original film is on my top 10 list. I could go on forever about the reasons why this film was not even close to the original, but could have been just as good. Why did they cast a female as the lead? The number of female paleontologists now is very low, but in the early 80's it was even smaller. They should have stuck to the all male theme. Titanium plates in surgery. I don't think so. The standard AO plating technique even today is stainless steel. This does not even mention the type of plate they pulled out. It is the wrong size and shape and it is a locking plate. They didn't even exist then. The flamethrowers are not even close to being authentic. That type of helo did not exist then. The types of oral cavity fillings: porcelain did not exist. They did have porcelain, but only for very large cavities. Why are the Americans not plaid by American actors. Do we really need a Brit and an Aussie to play us? They are good actors, but their accent is obviously covered up. The one shining new point of the film is that the Thing cannot replicate inorganic material. However, they jumped to the imitating nature of the Thing way too fast and they probably would have a real physician/surgeon on base to make some of the discoveries. They copied way too much including the flamethrower not working BS.",The Thing
441,phaota1,"Very Well Done, But Not As Good As The Original",7,27 November 2011,"I'm not going to go into tons of details about the film. If you are a fan of the original, then you will find it enjoyable. All of the acting is excellent. The outside locations and indoor sets, including the spacecraft exterior/interior, were perfectly done and homaged the first films look and feel. Even though there are a lot of CGI creature effects in the film, I really did not dislike its use. They did a great job on re-creating the Thing's crazy morphing abilities (even adding in several new wild designs) and made them seamlessly blend with the environmental settings and people. Do they look like CGI? Yes, but that can't be helped with the budget and time restraints they had to produce the movie. It would have taken them a much longer production time to do the same effects in the same real style as the original film, especially the two-faced creature. I really only have a few minor complaints. The scares were predictable. The only time I jumped a wee bit was toward the end in the spacecraft during the tunnel scene grab. You'll know when you see it. Yes, I expected the situation. It was obviously going to happen by the set-up, but it still startles you somewhat. All of the other attacks scattered throughout the movie are not scary. I guess it's just that you don't feel the tension among the characters as strong as you do with the original movie. Also, we don't find out what happens to Kate, which leaves a loose end that will never be answered. What I really like about the film is the endings fluid tie-in to the original's opening chase. Perfectly done, though I am left wondering where the dog came from? It was missing throughout the whole story, only to suddenly show up again at the end. Doesn't make sense. In short, if you loved Carpenter's original movie, you'll still like this prequel, even if it doesn't completely live up to expectations.",The Thing

However i was very pleasantly surprised, firstly because i realised that it was a prequel & not a remake, secondly because it is not one of those cheap movies with a whole cast full of gym sculpted teens with hair looking like they've just strolled out of a Hollywood hair salon, all with substandard acting ability. The cast here are exactly what you would expect to find in a remote research facility, most of them look rough around the edges, unshaven, clothes that are practical, not fashionable, and nearly all of them around the middle age mark.

The monster FX was not bad at all, like some here would complain. Those types would pretty much complain about anything. Now, I do wish the filmmakers had used less CG in two scenes in particular, but, in the end, it didn't distract me from the story, which was extremely faithful to John Carpenter's 1982 film. I would and will go back and see it again, as well as buy it on blu ray when it comes out. Oh, and have recommended it to all my friends, who are also die hard fans of the 1982 film.For those who have not seen the 1982 film, they will still enjoy this flick, as its just a lot of fun, and will hopefully immediately make them go and either rent or buy the original.

Then I heard the interesting news that it was going to be a prequel, focusing on the Norwegian's story that was alluded to in the first film. I became very curious to see what they would do with it. If you've seen the original movie, you know for a fact there is only ONE way this movie can end. And there are also several key moments that needed to occur in order to keep in tune with the continuity.Well you know what? Not a single beat was missed. From the red axe in the wall to the two faced creature burned in the snow to even the dog running from the helicopter. IT'S ALL THERE. And it's amazing. This prequel kept the spirit of the original film and a lot of themes while even embellishing and complimenting them. It was excellent. I have never been more pleased by a prequel or even a sequel for that matter.And I honestly think it's harder to make a prequel, because you have stricter guidelines. But this movie shines as a perfect example of what a proper prequel should look like. Nothing was over looked and every important detail was accounted for. And as people have already stated, the epilogue, mixed with the Carpenter theme is not only awesome, its chilling.There is nothing wrong with this prequel film and no true Carpenter fan should find a reason to complain.

Although this was an OK attempt to piece together the unanswered questions of what led up to the events in the original film, it just seemed to turn into an 'alien-esque' scenario where a woman with a flame-thrower ran the show. We've seen all that before from Sigourney Weaver so to see it again was a big disappointment. Had some good moments but fell very very flat in the last half-hour.

Being a fan of Carpenters film, I left the cinema bitterly disappointed over this latest film, which I guess deep-down I had to expect to be.These were some big shoes to fill.It seems that directors of this modern era have lost touch with what makes a good horror film. Its not about what you put in a film, its about HOW its used. This applies to actors, CGI and everything in-between.On the surface you could argue that it really shouldn't have been too difficult to make a worthy addition to the Thing franchise. Copious amounts of disgusting gore, half decent acting and a whole load of paranoia thrown in.The producers must have known this too, and I could see that they were trying to ram-home all three of these key factors, but boy, you could tell - And it was so forced it wasn't succeeding on any level. I think this is also further testament to just how well the Carpenter version worked these simple ideas - with a great cast and good direction.Of course, teenagers who watched Carpenters version then would be in their 40s now - and would probably be entertained by a different kind of film.It's also no secret that the largest market audience for movies is the under 25yo age bracket. The producers of this film were no doubt faced with the issue of ""Do we make a film for the fans, or do we make a film for the company and the cash?"" (A predicament I'm sure Michael Bay also would have had to ponder with Transformers) Given how many times I had to endure those overly-used, cheap 'jump-out-at-you' scare moments - and given the MA-15 rating, its obvious which way they ultimately went....And its a pity they focused so much on the cinema market - The 1982 film didn't satisfy the cinema audience... In fact it completely bombed at the Box Office - but by contrast it was a good film, and eventually got the respect it deserved (Thanks in part to VHS and NO thanks to ET!) Such respect wont be given to this new film, because there was little thought into how to truly use its subject matter to un-nerve people and genuinely creep them out - Something Carpenter's film did so well, especially for the day.But its not even a point specific to that time-period. Paranormal Activity showed that people can still be unnerved effectively TODAY - and for next to no money too, I might add.What we needed with this film was CREATIVITY, something Rob Bottin would know everything about. What I ultimately got with this latest installment however, was nothing more than a try-hard, watered-down mess of a film that doesn't even hold a candle to Carpenter's masterpiece.",The Thing

I'm not really a fan of the 1982 version, I seem to remember having a giggle at the monster and can't quite worship at the altar of John Carpenter. Many people were complaining about it as a horror movie, which I wouldn't class it as per se. In the same way I wouldn't call Alien a horror movie. They are suspense/thriller films set in a Sci-fi genre (albeit Alien is one of the best, which this isn't), and none the worse for it. I liked the old fashioned style of filming, without loads of grey/green CGI, and while it is often a mistake to see 'the monster' in any film, these ones work very well.

Campbell wrote a book called ""Who Goes There"", which had inspired the original ""The Thing from another World,"" directed by Christian Nyby. The film was acclaimed with its well-drawn characters and tight storytelling.Sometime later, in the early 80's, the thing's structure mutated again when famed director John Carpenter made a version of his own simply called ""The Thing."" Fans of the original had damned the film, but it eventually ended up embraced by critics, not necessarily with its characters, but its unique study on the effects of mass paranoia. And of course, the mechanical effects rivaled, and may have even surpassed, those of ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf in London,"" which had both come out around the same time.So what's left for this version? What's the formula for a monster movie these days? Well, there's gratuitous CGI, an unhealthy dose of full body shots far too early, pointless characters that only serve to wander of and get slaughtered and so on and clumsy, predictable dialogue. And boy, was it predictable. From the second we hear ""you will all be immortalized as the people that made this discovery,"" we could expect a lot of flashy science talk. But it didn't make their lines any smarter.Honestly, I think it's been a while since a seriously solid creature flick has hit the big screen for a mainstream audience. In fact, most of the best creature-features I've seen made within the new millennium have either been foreign, or indie films. So I had entered the theater with already low expectations. And it was, bar none, barely scathing the skin of my expectations.Of course, there was the ever lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"" ""Live Free or Die Hard"") as ""Kate Lloyd""- a paleontologist- holding a strong female role even if it does tend to echo ""Ripley"" from the famed and acclaimed ""Alien"" series. But other than that, there wasn't much in the way of any memorable performances. And without memorable characters or performances from our human characters, we feel no impact when something tragic happens in the film and are ultimately left with passive viewing.Now, if you're a creature buff like me, then look no further. Aside from a couple of remarkably bad CGI shots, the creature effects were otherwise well done. Especially with the masterful work of Amalgamated Dynamics Inc. (ADI) - run by Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis. (Their past work includes ""Tremors,"" ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien: Resurrection."") They work with practical (in camera) creature effects. And these guys should be heroes to anyone who values a good practical monster.Still, as good as their work was, is and always will be, the directorial choices to show the creatures so graphically and so early ultimately left us with, again, a lot of passive viewing.Bottom line, it's hard to hate this movie with my undying love for creatures. But the film did suffer from quite a few things. It appealed to the undying creature-buff in me. But sadly,it only appealed to me on that one level. The film's well staged attack scenes and wonderful creature designs were severely burdened by wooden characters, jump shots, campy jump scares and lack of inspiration. It's a prequel that might as well be a remake, and hardly poses as a threat to the standing of Nyby's 50's flick or Carpenter's 80's adaptation. It's an admirable mutagen alien strain, but with directorial and writing choices like these, it may ultimately go extinct.",The Thing
452,zen12084-231-9383,The Thing (2011) as awful as expected,1,6 December 2011,"I had low expectations for this film but I still was disappointed. I don't know if the film was aimed at morons or the director never watched the original. A dumbed-down Hollywood CGI-fest was inevitable but I thought they'd at least get the basics right.The film is supposed to be set straight before the 1982 film. The sets, costumes, clothes, style... everything feels modern and definitely not from the 80s. Even the computers look too modern. The plot isn't consistent at all. The camp is supposed to be full of Norwegians who don't speak English but instead we get lots of yanks, one of which is a laughable attempt to re-create the Mcreedy character which makes no sense at all.It almost feels like the helicopter and dog-thing at the end was bolted-on just to link up the second film. In reality this film is completely inconsistent and doesn't make any sense. In the 1982 film the Norwegians use thermite charges to expose the spacecraft underneath the ice. There is no mention of thermite in this film. In addition, the man who killed himself with a razor blade is missing and the inside of the Norwegian camp doesn't look the same. It's also too large. There shouldn't be any vehicles parked outside the spacecraft site either.Overall a complete mess of mindless CGI full of plot holes and deus ex-machinas. I wouldn't be surprised if the script writers hadn't seen the original film.",The Thing

But I liked the film so much.I watched it at 3 a.m and I have headphones.So I scared.The thing s screams are the scariest screams ever(for me).And The thing is really different from other monsters and aliens.It can infect anybody it touches.So it can attack anytime and it can be anybody.But the film wasn t as good as the first one.Because it wasn t so realistic.The thing is too clever but sometimes it acts like an idiot.It hides and waits to attack.But sometimes it acts like a wild animal.Anyvay,the thing is really weird and I like it.It s too disgusting and bloody.",The Thing

I was pleasantly surprised!It had all the trademarks of a good horror thriller, and added some really nice homages to John Carpenter's movie. I really liked the way the Norwegian camp was faithfully reproduced; the alien spaceship was fantastic; and the end credits tie-in to the 80's film absolutely spot on!I gave this film a 7... but if they had made it completely in Norwegian with subtitles - it would have got an 8.See it... there are some really nice ideas and most of your questions from the Carpenter classic are answered!",The Thing
455,schristmas-449-437375,Well done. Good movie.,8,15 August 2012,"This was going to be a difficult task. The original was a great movie, so this had its work cut out. However were this film does well is that it tries not to better the older movie. Its not flowing with constant CGI. It feels like it was made in the 80's, which i feel is an important factor. Its fast paced and the fear factor is still there. Some would say its a remake. In some cases that might feel like it being the case. But how different could this film possibly be to the original. How elements of the story tie in has been brilliantly done. Its not rushed in any way, and all conclusions to certain scenes for which you see in the Kurt Russell movie come together nicely without being forced. All in all a great job has been done. It has not tarnished the original. Maybe the ending has opened up better avenues for a sequel-sequel. Lets get out of the snow and go urban.",The Thing
456,Steve_Gad,Lacking in depth of any kind.,4,10 May 2018,"The thing that made 'The Thing' such a good watch, was the tension that steadily ramped up from start to finish. It had 'characters' and a story to it. Here, we basically get fast-forwarded to the CGI fest, that connects the dots of a flimsy plot. The CGI is technically OK, but the people being killed by it don't mean anything to the viewer, as character development was pretty much zero. 
The Norwegians were comic book Vikings, the Americans...well, American and the British chap was straight from a potty mouthed version of Mary Poppins. I half expected the cockney sparrow to bleat out ""Half a bladdy sixpence!"" on seeing the digitised doppleganger. The two leads that emerged out of the carnage (Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton) did a good job, but they weren't given a lot to work with. I was a little dismayed to see they had to throw in the old 'all run away, but the screaming girl falls over' routine, that has by now become a parody of a parody. Personally, I'm a big believer in letting classic movies well alone, and this did nothing to change that view. You know what they say 'If it ain't broke.........'.",The Thing
457,conny-noren,"At best an average horror movie to newcomers, to veterans - at best a disappointment",5,12 July 2012,"What happened at the Norwegian research facility? This question from John Carpenters 1982 sci-fi horror classic ""The Thing"" has echoed for years. A research facility left in complete chaos, dead bodies strewn across the area. Gruesome death - but why, and how exactly? Someone, somewhere got the idea to produce a prequel to the movie from 1982, and this prequel was finally released in the year 2011, almost thirty years after the original.The new movie is also called ""The Thing"", which may bring some confusion to the viewers who may see it as more of a remake. In any case, the movie picks up some time before the original. We witness how scientist Kate Lloyd, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is recruited by a Dr. Sander Halvordson, played by Ulrich Thomsen. She is asked to join on an expedition to Antarctica, and being the curious creature she is, naturally agrees.At the station, she joins a team of Norwegians and three Americans. The Norwegians unfortunately get rather little character development aside from Dr. Sander (who is not Norwegian, but actually Danish). Of the Americans, we get some time with the two helicopter pilots Sam Carter, played by Joel Edgerton, and Derek Jameson, played by Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje.The events we know are coming unfold early in the movie. No time is wasted on building the characters or any particular suspense, all hell breaks loose and the paranoia is unleashed. Or rather, the CGI monsters are unleashed. The action is very in-your- face, and the gaps in between fending of horrific monsters give little tension to the viewer. The exception to the rule is once scene where paranoia begins to set in.Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a decent job at taking the lead in the movie. She does not become the invincible heroine but rather does what she must do, by necessity rather than choice. Co-star Joel Edgerton delivers a rather flat performance, he represents something of the American good guy, come to save the day. The end scene ties it up very nicely with the original, but that may be one of the few high points in this modern day production.It's hard to know if the screen writer Eric Heisserer, director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. or the producers are to blame - but someone has along the way been given a golden opportunity. Whereas the Carpenter original was a more direct adaptation of the 1938 novella ""Who Goes There?"" by John W Campbell, the 2011 movie had free reins. They could have given us a chilling, haunting, psychological thriller with great suspense, instead we are led into a movie that more resembles a splatter movie than the classic original. This movie is at best an average horror movie by itself, but seen as a prequel it cannot amount to anything else than a disappointment.",The Thing
458,brandonmouser,I pretty much agree with brwinner35's review.,9,16 October 2011,"I pretty much agree with brwinner35's review. This film did everything in its power to remain true to Carpenter's version. They even hinted at Carpenterian background music. It wasn't a perfect film, but it was far better than most being made today, and deserves mad respect for not screwing things up or adding some lame twist. I think that the problem with any prequel is that it removes a lot of mystery, but it was cool that they tried to keep you guessing as to whether or not a lame twist was coming. I liked that the female characters weren't cliché heroines. The technology in the film was accurate, i.e. 1980's keyboards and monitors. Also, everyone had great beards, which is totally necessary for any hardcore fan, haha!!! The story was awesome and realistically explained how the first film begins--as the credits roll you will want to throw in Carpenter's version and pick up where you left off. Honestly, I would have given this film a 7 or an 8, but it deserves a 9 because it is probably one of the best prequels out there, at least based on a 1980's classic.",The Thing

I originally thought that this 2011 version is actually a remake (that's why we stayed up until the very end of the credits waiting for what will happen to the dog! hahah...). It's just after reading the reviews here that I came to know that it's actually a prequel. I'm an avid fan of this type of genre. I love the ""Aliens"" series, ""The Fly"" and even ""Re-Animator"" so I was actually looking forward to watching this updated version of the John Carpenter classic. Honestly, I enjoyed this film. It's like the Aliens meets Agatha Christie! hehe... The tension of not knowing who's still human or alien amongst them is quite suspenseful and engrossing. I think the director did a good job. There was no point in time during the film that I felt bored (I fell asleep watching the ""Transformers""). It held a tight grip on me for the most part. The effects are quite good although there's nothing I haven't seen before. The sound effect is terrific, with crisp, loud bass making the scenes more intense and terrifying. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good in the lead character. All in all this is a well made thriller and a good prequel to the original. Makes me want to see the sequel ASAP.",The Thing
460,chrisskaja,"Very well done with ample homage to John Carpenter's ""Thing""",10,14 October 2011,"I liked it very much. For being a relatively unknown foreign director, It was well done, paying ample homage to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" 1982. Many details appear in this new film that connects you with the 1982 film. If you liked the 1982 film, then you can't help but like this new one. Right down to the careful crafting of sets, alien creature effects, the alien ship, and actor look-alike's for the few Norwegians you see in Carpenter's film. There are scenes spoken in Norwegian with English subtitles, but hey, this movie takes place at a Norwegian scientific station. It added to the feel of the movie. There's even a perfect doorway opened near the end to create a ""Thing"" sequel to Carpenter's film, which I surely hope materializes.

462,roxyy-75461,Really kissing America's arse in this one,6,25 March 2020,"Disclaimer: I have not seen the original from the 80s, so I can't comment on the relationship between the two.The thing I noticed about half way through this film is that it really sucks up to American audiences, whether it makes sense to the plot or not.The film is set on a scientific research station run by Norwegians. There are only four Americans there, two of which are only there to fly the plane. Yet, all of these scientists use the imperial system (god forbid American audiences be subject to a centimetre) and speak English the majority of the time. They even comment on the fact that Lars can't speak English, but he ""makes up for it"" by working hard. Wow. The last two remaining alive are, of course, American.The film itself is average. All of the characters lack backstory or any real personality, so it's really hard to care about any of them surviving. I was certain that Sam died in the crash, because he was easily one of the most boring characters. I was unpleasantly surprised to find him being one of the main protagonists.The idea is good and the CGI isn't that bad, especially for 2011. But it definitely needed more of a plot line, more character development, and less pandering to American audiences.",The Thing
463,blissfullycat,It was a very good prequel if you really think about it...,9,18 October 2011,"The first thing I have to address are the 'so-called' cons of the movie...First is, a lot of people who have reviewed it negatively have said it was because the aliens would transform willy nilly before groups of people, unlike Carpenter's version where they would take over one by one... well YEAH! How do you think an alien, who had never met any humans before, learned not to attack a group of them, because it had resulted in catastrophe for the alien at the Norwegian camp, therefore it LEARNED to be smarter when it made itself to the other camp.Another is that many people believe them bringing in Americans made no sense. Sander was the one who was contacted about the finding and HE chose who he brought, not the Norwegians, otherwise they may have chosen Norwegians. And the fact that women were chosen was mostly to differentiate the lead from Kurt's Mac.Yet another complaint is that the Norwegians were expendable... well, forgive me if I am wrong, but wasn't the final survivor from the camp a Norwegian... Not to mention most of the Norwegians died when they were trying to protect others, and one actually killed himself, so really an equal amount of Norwegians and non-Norwegians were killed by the thing (or turned into one) The only con I will agree that really stuck out to me in the movie was that there was a bit too much CGI in certain areas, although I believe it would have looked much better had they lit the scenes a bit darker. I can also agree on one bit of continuity error, in that 2 vehicles were left at the ship site but they were not there in John Carpenters version, although Kate may have driven hers away and the storm could have covered the other one once it had burned up a bit.The acting was good, even if character development was a bit lacking. The character of Adam was particularly well done, as he was an on screen personification of what we were feeling as viewers. The Sander/Adam face meld scene was also very effective and one of the most disturbing and memorable scenes of the film, which tied in to the fact that the double faced thing they found in the original was one of the more memorable visuals from that movie. The practical effects were great and the tie ins to Carpenters version were well executed.It may not have been as good as the original but that was to be expected. Otherwise, a very good prequel and movie.",The Thing
464,demontrace,One of the most illogical movies ever made.,1,26 July 2018,"This movie spits in the face of The Thing(1982), and is an absolute disgrace to the series. It has almost none of the clever set ups of the previous movie, and doesn't establish suspense anywhere close to what the first film did.It wasn't clear what was happening or who the thing might be in the previous movie, because you were only fed as much information as the characters had. In this movie, you have unnecessary pauses as characters react to situations, completely illogical responses to situations, and excessive showing of The Thing itself, killing it's value as a monster from another world.
The more you see the thing, the less frightening it is, and even more so with CGI effects. The previous movie had some ridiculous animations at times, but it's the real deal what you see unfold. It's gruesome, and handmade. The CGI animations in this just look ridiculous, and it establishes similarly ridiculous death scenes. The characters seemingly stand there as they then get executed by the Thing. The characters in the previous film seemed considerably more helpless, and surprised by The Thing when it attacked. It was quick, and lethal. The death scenes in this one go on forever, as people stand around in shock with their mouths hanging open. I cannot believe no matter how horrible the sight, that people would just stand there with flamethrowers in hand, and just watch as people get devoured.I'll also add there's some gag worthy small talk flirting at the beginning of the movie(I'm most certainly not referring to the Norwegian joke at the very beginning), that I'm pretty certain no one asked for, EVER, in a Thing movie. Just what my suspenseful movies need, some pointless flirting. Not dogging on the female actors, they're fine, but the previously all male cast definitely kept those people more focused on the plot, and not a drugged Joel Edgerton mumbling some charm.This movie is laughably bad, but no where near the level of being enjoyable. It reveals some prequel information for The Thing universe, but somehow a movie released 29 years after the previous movie, couldn't hold a candle to that movie. Whoever created these scenes was clearly drunk, or had their child think these up. So stupid it's painful.",The Thing

I NEEDED it to be good.Another understatement would be to say I was disappointed. I was not disappointed, I was furious at what a mockery this ''movie'' turned out to be.The writing is beyong horrible and the characters are beyond goofy and unintelligent.Just to give a few examples:
After giving a speech about how anyone could be the thing and how they need to be careful and keep an eye on everyone as they could be a killer, the main protagonist instantly agrees to go alone in a dark backroom with another characters.... because reasons.(but wait, there's more)
At this point, the main character should be done for but.... no. You see, the main character (and humans in general) are not the only ones as smart as a squrieel in this movie.Seeing the main character entered the dark room alone with it and TURNED IT'S BACK TO IT, the thing proceeds to have a very long, very loud, very cringe transformation giving the main protagonist time to check her clock, eat a cookie, yawn and then run away.(end of example)At this point I felt very much like I was watching a comedy movie, it's just that the joke was one me and on anyone who loved John Carpenter's classic, and on anyone who would have liked a scary, logical, memorable movie.Literally every decission made, by the humans or thing in this movie makes any sense.The characters get virtually 0 development time. Development time was recorded but it was cut out of the movie because... reasons.The main character is a random chick with 0 martial spirit that you will only remember for the silly, constipated face she makes when trying to concentrate or be scared or whatever.There are virtually no memorable scenes. The monsters are extremely generic and made with very bad CGI.From start to end it's a joke of a movie and one should avoid losing his/her time with it, especially if said person is a fan of the amazing classic of John Carpenter.",The Thing

Without giving anything away, this monster totally lives up to the gruesome original. I thought the characters were understated but perfect for a movie like this (especially Lars). You really believe these people would behave the way they did.Remember it's a monster movie, it's not a Chekhov play.The suspense was great. I was actually surprised by who was the monster and who wasn't (and I watch a lot of these movies). Since I loved the 1982 version so much, I like that they took their prequel responsibilities seriously and really did set up the 1982 film well.

Carpenters Version Still The Undisputed King.,5,21 February 2012,"Like most reviewers, I am a huge fan of Carpenter's film (shame on me I have yet to see the actual original) and when I learned this was a prequel about the Norwegian camp, I was very excited. That, to me, signaled that this was not a reboot and not a remake. However, I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a reboot. Too many scenes felt like they were stolen from Carpenters film. For me there was nothing new here, they did not create their own ""memorable scenes"" and instead used Carpenters tricks from the first film. Not only were the tricks old, but Carpenters version executed them better. It did everything better. The acting was forgettable, no single character was able to draw me in, the female lead has been given credit for her performance but to me she was boring and flat. The CG looked nice, but was used in place of the fans favorite - makeup and fake guts. The story and script, like most sci-fi these days was pretty thin. The script is filled with lines to help move the plot along and give the audience understanding of the creature. Our lead figured out how the creature works after she spent all of 3 seconds in a room with it. She's a fast learner I guess? In tune with aliens maybe, who knows. Overall, this is just another reboot, being called a prequel for marketing purposes. There's nothing new here. The single best part of the movie is right as the credits roll. Keep watching, you get a very well done and familiar sounding treat as the film butts right up to the opening scene of Carpenters film.I could give this movie more than 5 stars, but won't.

469,jflores-20,"A perfect prequel to Carpenters ""The Thing""",9,20 October 2011,"First off, let me start off by saying that this movie is not a remake of the 1982 John Carpenter ""The Thing"". I don't understand why people keep saying that this is a remake, when it is not! Just because it seemed similar to some parts in the 82 version, that doesn't mean that it's a remake.This movie serves as a perfect introduction to John Carpenters ""The Thing"" in case you haven't seen it, and a great reintroduction to one of the best sci/fi horrors ever made (in my opinion). I'm a BIG fan of the 1982 ""The Thing"", and I remember watching it and wondering how the events unfolded in the Norwegian camp. Thanks to the 2011 ""The Thing"", it really gives a solid backdrop of what happened, while staying true to the story that Carpenters adaptation established! That's what makes this movie so compelling. It actually stayed true to the 1982 story! Though similar in the 82 version in regards to characters, and certain scenes, it wasn't an exact clone of the 82 movie because it had it's own individuality. For instance; the tests that would prove who was human, was different completely different in the new movie. The great thing is that though it had it's own exclusive moments, it never really ventured outside ""The Things"" universe. If anything, it gave the viewer more understanding of what this Alien was capable of.This movie was very well directed. From production to actual settings, it was very well done. The acting was also very good. Winstead did a great job as usual. Edgerton, in a limited role, did excellent. The surrounding cast also did well though the sense of paranoia from Carpenters version wasn't felt in this movie as much.If I had any negative remarks on the movie, it would have to be the music score. I think they could have done a better score to help submerge the viewer into the experience. Carpenters ""The Thing"" had an amazing score that really intensified certain aspects of the movie. Another thing was the Special FX in certain parts. In the helicopter scene, the transformation of the 1st ""imitation"" was sub-par. It looked a little sluggish to me. Also, the part when ""Edvard"" attached himself to the other guy, there were parts that looked too animated. Something I expected using CGI. Also, in regards to continuity, they never showed when the Norwegians put the charges in the ice to blow up the layers of ice on top of the actual alien ship.Aside from those minor issues, I thought the movie was great! A must see if you're a fan of the 82 movie. If you have never seen the 82 movie, then see the 2011 ""The Thing"" and then watch Carpenters ""The Thing"". What you will have is a great movie experience. After I got home from viewing the ""The Thing"" (2011) I immediately sat down and re-watched Carpenters ""Thing"". I was glad to see so many references from the old movie, used in the new movie. BRAVO!!! SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",The Thing
470,kirknesstony,An excellent narrative for a difficult project,9,10 December 2011,"'The Thing' (2011) was always going to be an exercise in continuity and style. The film could never be its own invention as it had to play close attention to the well-known narrative already present in Carpenter's 'The Thing' (1982). Many film-makers may have baulked at such a venture, due to these restrictions, so full marks to the writers, to the director and to the rest of the production team for pulling off such a demanding task. I, for one, am not at all bothered that the alien is fully displayed in all its glory... and all its gory.. at various points throughout the film, for those who love the 1982 film already KNOW what the creature looks like! So why pretend its appearance is still a mystery? There are also iconic references to the 1982 film that are clearly referenced in this prequel. The burned alien in the snow outside the camp, the axe in the wall, the body with the cut throat and, most importantly, the helicopter chasing the husky with Lars desperately trying to shoot it. Wonderfully linked. Even the Carpenter score is heard at points during the film and at the end. The special effects were also 1982-esque, which was a brave and respectful touch that made this film work so well against Carpenter's version. However, I do have two main gripes. Why did we have to have to have all that nonsense inside the space-ship? For several minutes, it just suddenly became another film and this sequence neither worked, added anything nor fitted in with the previous narrative of the film that had been so so carefully developed. In fact, these few minutes almost ruined the film. Surely, during the editing, someone must have noticed how incongruous this whole sequence was! What made the spaceship sequence even more annoying was the continuity. In Thing82 the entire top of the spaceship had been exposed by the Norwegian research team and was seen to be scorched/damaged by both the entry into the Earth's atmosphere and its crash-landing, whereas in Thing2011 the spaceship remained entirely covered in ice and looked to be in almost showroom condition! Secondly, it would have been a wonderful touch to have had the crew of the Norwegian camp being filmed circling the spaceship when it still lay trapped in the ice, as evident in the black-and-white home movie film, played during the Thing82 version. So, to summarise, if the spaceship sequence had not occurred in Thing2011 and had been, instead, replaced with a simple tractor-chase, culminating in a flame-thrower finale, and if the making of the home-movie video films had been shown, then this would have been a tidier version of a truly commendable film.",The Thing
471,matthewur,A valiant effort that is reasonably successful...,7,10 June 2012,"It seems that many reviewers of The Thing (2011) were disappointed by the film, but I have to disagree. Is it the masterpiece of scifi/horror that JC's movie was? No. But how could it be, given that it is essentially a retelling of the same story? As such, the potential existed for this movie to be a completely uninteresting rehash of a tired old plot, but The Thing (2011) manages to project enough unique charm and creativity to avoid nosediving into that abyss. The characters are well-acted and believable (this coming from someone who has languished in the sordid world of Academia for the last ten years), the effects are nothing short of amazing, and the plot manages to walk the thin line between boring rehash of an overdone theme and intriguing, unique retelling of a great story in a reasonably successful way. Those who are looking for answers to some of the questions that the JC movie generated (e.g. How/why did the Norwegians find this thing and dig it up? What is inside The Thing's ship? Why did that one dude slit his throat and wrists? Just who were those two people in the two-headed, Thinged-out mish-mash of distorted human flesh that McReady and Copper brought back from the Norwegian camp?) will not be disappointed. What's more, the film manages to answer some of these questions without revealing too much about The Thing's origins, allowing the audience to retain the awesome sense of terror and mystery that this creature generated in the first film (anyone who has seen the garbage-pile of an Alien ""prequel"" that is Prometheus will understand what I'm talking about here). All-in-all, The Thing (2011), while not worthy of the ""brilliant"" moniker that can be deservedly applied to JC's film, still manages to be a respectable, entertaining and intriguing new chapter in one of the greatest scifi/horror stories of all time.",The Thing
472,publisher-779-141816,Enjoyed many THINGS about this film.,7,16 October 2011,"I remember seeing John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in the movies opening weekend back in 1982. It was fun, yet bleak, shocking and, at times, over the top. I really liked it. But a lot of critics slammed it. And for many years it became this underground cult favorite. Now, many years later, it's considered a classic.I didn't go into Matthijs van Heijningen's ""The Thing (2011)"" with a lot of expectations. I saw the trailer. Liked what I saw. Learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead was cast in the lead. Thought that was interesting, a little different. Heard it was a prequel, thought that was VERY interesting. So I went to the film to relax, have a good time, let it wash over me, much the way I did when I went to Carpenter's film back in 1982.I saw it the first day it opened, Friday, Oct. 14, 2011. Had fun. Thought it was more of a popcorn film than Carpenter's. Liked Winstead. And the ""Lars"" character. A fan of movie monsters, I got a kick out of this ""Thing,"" a creature that was all business. I came out of it with a bounce in my step, talking about it. There's a lot to like here. And I was glad it wasn't a carbon copy of Carpenter's film (even though some critics have accused it of being just that).The characters are a different lot from the one's in Carpenter's film. And some are memorable. Winstead is fine in the lead. It was refreshing to see someone who wasn't a ""MacReady"" dealing with this situation. Since this was a different film, I really wanted to follow someone else through the adventure. Unlike Kurt Russell's chess-playing, booze swilling helicopter pilot, Winstead's ""Kate"" is a young career-minded woman trying to make her way in a man's world. She's in the minority in this group, and is put in her place a time or two in the first reel. This makes the ""who's in charge"" game in the second act fun to watch.While Carpenter's film is a fascinating study of dark hallways and isolation, this Thing's got more scope. It's a ""bigger"" film. Some of the major action sequences are rather ambitious. And they work very well (I'm staying away from spoilers here). There are some very cool special effects. And the CG isn't the worst in the world. Carpenter, no doubt, would have employed some if he had the chance back in 1982. Did anyone ever see the stop-motion ""Blair Monster"" footage he scrapped? Carpenter was always looking out on the horizon for new ways to bring his creations to life. Nothing wrong with that. I thought the creature effects in the new ""Thing"" were pretty good, had personality and showed us how dangerous this ""Thing"" could be in a snap.There was also a lot of care put into ""The Thing (2011)"" to make you believe it was made in the same universe as Carpenter's film. There are a bunch of similarities. Font styles over the credits. The layout of the Norwegian camp. Lens flares (sounds obsessive on my part, but when lights or flame throwers were burning during exteriors, the lens flares looked very similar to those in Carpenter's film).Like Carpenter's film, I think ""The Thing (2011)"" will become a cult classic in its own right. People will find it on home video, revisit it and talk about it.",The Thing
473,janetkroemer,absolute crap! watch the original one with Kurt Russell,1,16 October 2011,"wow, that was the slowest movie I have ever seen! Absolute garbage! the only good thing that I can say is that the special effects... (when there were some, are somewhat decent. The acting was very basic and not impressive. The main actress was very (ho-hum-plastic and obviously didn't take acting lessons). I watch all the scary movies that come out, and WAS optimistic and wanted to believe that it would get better, sadly...it didn't. Don't waste a penny on this one, you will be very disappointed.

And then one day i saw the thing remake,gheta f.ck!! they destroy the great movie. I said to myself, I will not give money to ruin one of my favorite films that marked my childhood.and I did not looked at him.One, rainy day, I thought about what to see and decided to give the movie a chance. I did not cross the selection of film.I have to be careful about the choice of words,or i*am blacklisted... If you have not seen the original, I'm sure you will like the movie,and for you who viewed original,including me, the film was a nice surprise.very good cgi,not bad actors at all!

I wasn't expecting much with the 2011 version and I just didn't get it. The story didn't make any sense, the characters weren't plausible and the acting just wasn't there.They tried to copy the 80's version, even stating 1982 at the start of the movie but it just didn't work.If you're thinking of paying money to see this then just don't bother.The only people who will take anything from this movie are the zombie elite (braindead and stupid).My advise is, be intelligent and watch the 80's version (again).",The Thing
477,beavermatic-77-102128,Great flick! definitely a well paid expansion to THE THING universe!,10,14 October 2011,"Awesome prequel... graphics up to snuff. Actors were decent. Score wasn't too shabby, and the action/intensity was all there. Storyline got better and better as it went along. Atmosphere was just right for the style of the story, which does differ slightly from Carpenter's version. Definitely a great expansion to the THE THING universe.Think of it as Jurassic Park + Aliens + X-files + Predator + The Thing (1982) + Dawn of the Dead = The Thing 2011I see a lot of people trying to turn this into some sort of competition with the '82 John Carpenter release I mean, seriously, look at what people are saying they are trying to top. Carpenter as director/producer, Morricone for the score, and actors like Russell and Brimley? Seriously? You will never, ever, ever top that... no matter how much money you have, how hard you try. It will never be undone because it was all the right timing and magic to make that a timeless masterpiece that just can't be beaten.Instead, the prequel focuses on not trying to outdo Carpenter's, but expand on it... and it does it amazingly well. A very worthy prequel indeed! I just think to many people are trying to toss the two films into competition, when the production and development teams themselves have stated they were not attempting to ""beat"" carpenters masterpiece, but fill in the blanks and give a very detailed back story.Carpenters version is thriller, panic, and group fear with some action.STRIKE's version was action, chaos, anxiety and the tragedy that occurred leading up to the events of Carpenters with a far more descriptive background on the thing itself... yet still not unveiling all the secrets of this unusual alien monster.And for the effort, and one happy fan, I still say it deserves right around a 9/10. Especially considering prequels and additions and remakes today... this one stands out like the ""dawn of the dead"" STRIKE update.Very entertaining, and the ending scene during the credits really reached out and touched my nostalgic heart... the crowd actually cheered. I took friends to see it on release night tonight as well, and all 6 of them... and this is a first, came out loving it. 2 of them had not even seen the Carpenter version. Now that's impressive!",The Thing
478,Batman5273,Perfect Prequel to a Classic Horrow Flick,9,14 October 2011,"My FTG-Nerd Review http://fronttowardsgamer.com/2011/10/14/ftg-nerd- review-the-thing-movie/Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars in not a remake but an actual prequel the the 1982 John Carpenter classic horror movie, The Thing. Is this a refreshing addition to the story's cannon or should it have stayed in a block of ice?STORYAntarctica, 1982. A group of Swedish – I mean Norwegian – scientific researchers make the discovery of a lifetime, but they need help. The site leader enlists paleontologist, Kate LLoyd to help unearth the ""structure"" and ""specimen"" they found. Being the chance of a lifetime, Kate agrees to fly up to the remote location.The second Kate lands she is immediately taken by snowcat to the discovery zone. Kate is then briefed that a space craft that landed thousands of years ago was found, as well as a survivor. The team cuts the being out of the ice and takes it back to the research facility for analysis.While the team celebrates their new celebrity status in the rec room, the creature wakes up and breaks free from its frozen prison. Now the team have to scramble for answers while trying to survive. But the creature has a trick; it can replicate itself into any organic being it touches. The alien will now pit the humans against each other while it picks them off, one at a time.OVERVIEWBefore I wrote this review, I wanted to rewatch the 1982 version to figure out exactly how the new movie would fit in. Was it a remake? Was it a different interpretation? Was it a prequel? I can confidently say the the 2011 version is indeed a prequel and a damn good one. The movie was written by the guy who wrote Final Destination 5, had the same producers as the Dawn of the Dead remake, and is directed by a guy who, up until now, only did commercials. So what made this prequel so good? They got it right! You can tell the entire film crew studied the ins and outs of the John Carpenter original. The two movies fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Where one shows something. the other explains how it got there (without giving anything away, look for a fire axe in the two movies). Even as the prequel ends, the 1982 version immediately starts. Hell they even used the same well known John Carpenter font and music in the ending credits.Mary Elizabeth Winstead portrays paleontologist, Kate Lloyd. Up until now she was always a supporting character in movies like Death Proof and Live Free or Die Hard. It wasn't until she played Ramona Flowers in Scott Pilgrim Vs the World that people really started to take notice of her. In The Thing, she proves she can take a lead role and handle it with confidence. She was smart and believable. The rest of the cast was good, but not as great as the ensemble cast Kurt Russell had to support him.What The Thing does is perfectly analyze the human condition. Both movies give different teams the same experience and you see just exactly how they figure it out as they battle each other. The creature is just there to grease the wheels. Just like any zombie movie, where you think they are the enemy, you realize that we are actually the enemy to each other if given the wrong conditions. Imagine the movies as ""Survivor: Antarctica"" where the tribal councils don't vote you off the island, but instead vote if you are human or not. And that's what makes both of these movies brilliant.Initially I was going to give The Thing a 4/5, because it is a good standalone monster movie. But after rewatching the original I had to bump it up for sheer attention to detail and homage to the original. It is obvious that in 29 years, film technology has changed, so the creature effects are now computer generated and picture is crisper. But they tried so hard to recreate everything. They even used the 1982 Universal logo at the beginning of the film. The movie was dark and spooky. In video game terms, think of the monsters and atmosphere of Dead Space.So the question isn't should you see the movie, because you absolutely should. But rather in what sequence. To really appreciate what the film makers did today, you need to see the original. And you need to see the original first. Why? For the same reason you see the original Star Wars trilogy before seeing the prequels. If you see them in ""order,"" it ruins the huge surprise that Vader is Luke's father. The same goes for The Thing. Both movies answer each others questions, but the newer one will give away too many of the surprises of the original. And the ending of the newer one will make more sense. So why are you still reading my review? Go now and rent the original, or better yet just stream it on Netflix and then run to the theater this weekend and see The Thing. You'll thank me later!",The Thing
479,joegevans,"OK, but not The REAL Thing.",3,9 December 2011,"****CONTAINS VERY SPECIFIC Spoilers**** Also, not really a review of the film in it's own right, but as a huge fan of the original I wanted to add my opinion, for what it's worth.Firstly, I didn't hate it. When you see one of your favourite films being revisited there is the inevitable mix of excitement and worry. The director and producers were very clever here by not calling it a remake. It is easy to say that it basically is a remake of the first, but then I think to myself, how different could they actually make it given the setting and theme? There are enough references to appease hardcore fans of the original and I liked the ending (although clearly tagged on to give it prequel status – it plays no part in this film).Where the film went wrong was with the Thing itself. For me, having it leap out of the ice was a big mistake, I was enjoying the film up until that point but as soon as that happened I could see the atmosphere start to crumble. Something that was so horrible about the original creature was its movement. As far as I understand it, it should be extremely private and somewhat vulnerable when it's in its metamorphic state, it is unpredictable and random in its attacks, its tentacle things feel around like the worms from Tremors, not precise lethal barbs that shoot out to kill like the tail of Giger's Alien. The problem with the fast moving Thing continues throughout the whole film and during one long scene at the end (the bit before they leave for the spacecraft) they are playing hide and seek with the Thing when it is totally mangled, running around and smashing through walls. This was totally ridiculous and rejects everything scary about the creature, it just makes it a standard Human vs Monster chase in isolation. The real Thing would find somewhere private to complete it's cycle.The whole spacecraft idea was strange and unnecessary. It was remarkably close to the scene in The X Files film, although the look and feel of the craft did give that scene a feeling of the shared world of Science Fiction – perhaps we can expect an Alien vs Predator vs Thing in the future (I would cry if that happened).The CGI was weak. Why not use animatronics? If ever there was a film where they should have returned to the wonderful world of animatronics then this was it. What a treat that would have been.Overall, it's basically a remake that is nowhere near as good, due to the fact that they replace terror-inducing slow burning tension with fast paced action. The 'prequel' angle does work, but the film shares too much cross-over not to be regarded as a remake (although as mentioned I'm glad they didn't go all it and call it a remake). They changed JUST enough to not make it a total rip off (I liked the 'fillings test' – I thought they were going to go straight in for the 'hot wire test' which would have been much too lazy). The original is a masterpiece, this film is a fair few points above the atrocious Alien v Predator rubbish, but not as far as it could have been. 5.5/10.",The Thing
480,poopshec,Quite watchable!,7,15 April 2012,"Although not nearly as good as 1982. legendary Carpenter's The Thing, and not even trying to be, this is actually a very good movie comparing it to other modern horror/slasher/action crap they are making today. This movie is more interesting than Paranormal activity, smarter than Piranha 3D, and, i assure you, scarier than most ""horrors"" they are trying to sell us. Nevertheless, you can't compare this movie with horrors made in ""golden age"" of 1980's. It's like comparing Mozart to Bieber, sure, they both are musicians, but one is an artist, a true master of his work, and the other is Bieber.Tip: Watch much scarier Carpenter's version first, even if you saw it 20 times, and then relax with this one. It's a good way to spend 3 hours of your time (way better than watching Piranha 3D, brrrr :)).",The Thing
481,t_daskalo,Bad,3,24 November 2011,Well... I was waiting for this movie like crazy. I loved 1982's The Thing and I expected so many things. That could have been delivered If I judge from the after the ending credits Thing. Let me be more clear. This film is divided in to two separate films. The Thing before the ending credits and The Thing afterwards. The second was excellent and showed that this could really work but the first part was horrible really. First off while this movie was supposed to be a prequel you couldn't really tell. It copied the original in so many ways (most important in storytelling) that you assume it is a remake and not a prequel. It failed to distant itself from the original and to deliver something new in the table except some poor CGI horror and an abuse of the lens flare effect. What really lets you down though is the complete lack of suspense.,The Thing
482,colejames16,To Thing or not to Thing... That is the question...,6,27 October 2011,"Remakes intrigue me. I just can't help myself though; I have this false sense of hope that I'm going to be impressed with a story I love adapted into modern times. That's why I just had to see 'The Thing', which is a 2011 prequel (supposedly) to the original 1982 movie. We had to toss a coin between that and 'Red State' though, another must see. But we saw 'The Thing'. And? One thing to sum it up: I'm damn glad I saw the movie on Cheap Tuesday. Ignore the supposed synopsis of the film – The Thing is literally a scene-for-scene remake of the original, minus Kurt Russell (boo!) and with a chicky babe in the main role. Mary Elizabeth Winstead isn't a bad actress, but she isn't given a whole lot to run with in this film. So, to set the scene, it's Antarctica 1982 (a wee bit before Kurt Russell arrived). Winstead's character Kate Lloyd, a graduate paleontology student, has been enlisted by the world's dodgiest scientist Dr. Sander Halvorson, to investigate a top-secret life form frozen in Antarctic ice. The two, along with a team of fairly unmemorable characters, dig the creature out of the ice to study it, whilst frozen. Of course the mayhem begins when it breaks out of the ice one night. Turns out, the creature can absorb other life forms and clone itself to replicate anything and anyone. From here on the film takes the original's lead of paranoia, where the team spend the remainder of the film considering the trust the have of each other and trying to work out who is still human and who is an alien clone. It does everything wrong what John Carpenter did so right in the original. My biggest bug bear was how the 'Thing' was quite happy to reveal itself to groups of people at a time; this is something that didn't occur in the original as it was considered to be vulnerable in these circumstances. However, my bug bear was soon overshadowed by a giant spaceship. I won't say any more See the film if you want. It's even annoying to write about. Say what you will, I refuse to call it a prequel because it simply isn't that. Definitely one to wait for DVD though. Even spunky Eric Christian Olsen couldn't save it for me. Kinda wish I had've gone to 'Red State' now",The Thing
483,drummop,Not as bad as expected!,6,28 November 2011,"Wasn't really looking forward to this, being a fan of Carpenters version, but this wasn't totally awful. Stole most of the good ideas from the 1982 film, though added a couple of interesting ones of its own, (enough to keep me watching anyway). I particularly liked the way the ending tied in with the beginning of JC's film. As a stand alone movie it would be fine if the other one didn't exist, but all it made me do was want to watch my Blu ray of the original. It reminded me of Let Me In, a good film on its own, yet pales in comparison to Let the Right One In, so you have to ask just why they bothered? I can understand that the subtitles in LTROI might put some moviegoers off, but there's no such reason for spending reputedly $35m on this. Ps - does anyone else think the CGI in the early part of the movie was very poorly done? They improved as the film went on but the early views of the alien attacking or absorbing humans looked really cheap & false, maybe their budget was gone and they still had the early SFX still to do?",The Thing
484,fx939,They did it!!!,10,26 November 2011,"Have seen The Thing 2011 today with my brother. We both liked it very much. The story was really good and the monsters were really great. I think that now, finally we could really see what the Thing really is and what it is capable of doing. Miss Winstead is really great and I have first seen her in Bruce Willis Die Hard movie 4.0. She is very talented actor and surely has great future in front of her. The attention to details in this movie is phenomenal and the movie is very clean and nicely done. The story is definitely in line with the 80:s movie The Thing. It will also be interesting to see what Ridley Scott will do with his Prometheus movie (Alien Prequel) being close to us in time. For me this movie (The Thing 2011) is great and deserves to be The Thing Prequel.",The Thing
485,pfinger1983,Very good stand alone film,8,2 December 2011,"I'm torn when it comes to this film. i know this is technically a prequel, but I think it is perhaps more a novel take on the ""remake genre"". If you've watched John Carpenter's version then you will have a pretty good idea of what happened at the Norwegian camp, so there won't be much new here, but it is still a good film. And the fact that it covers events which lead to the situation in Carpenter's film is quite pleasing. There's a feeling of completeness. I happened to have watched them almost back to back and they work very well together.If you haven't seen the ""original"", then this is well worth a watch (as is the ""original""). I am not a fan of modern sci-fi / horror films, they tend to be all about the special effects and little story, but I enjoyed this movie. There is not as much suspense as the ""original"", but the effects are great and not over the top, which is a nice change.In short, there seems to be a lot of moaning about this film from lovers of John Carpenter's film, even from myself when I heard they were making this, but after seeing it I would recommend it to all.",The Thing
486,celebsongs,A prequel to a remake of a 50's sci-fi horror that ends up playing like a remake of a remake.,6,24 August 2012,"This prequel to John Carpenter's film of the same name plays as a functional and meticulously loyal companion piece to it's 80′s masterpiece. Going in, my expectations weren't that high. In recent years Hollywood has furnished us with countless prequels, remakes and re-imaginings that with a few exceptions, have mostly been voiceless exercises in tedium. The film focuses on the events that transpired at the Norwegian base and for anyone overly familiar with the Carpenter film, there's a pleasing sense of déjà vu in the way the sets have been carefully recreated. The casting of Norwegian actors is another unexpected, but very welcome element proving that the financial backers had the sense to place authenticity as a priority. So far so good then. What follows is not a bad film, just a pretty unremarkable one that more or less plays the same beats as the film it's supposed to be re- enforcing in a way that smacks of trying to sell an old product to a new generation. Knowing the fate of the Norwegian characters from the other film, there's an air of inevitability about how things unravel and it's slightly tiresome watching great things you've seen in an older film merely replicated with more whizzy effects. On the subject of effects, it's pleasantly surprising to see the makers have gone to lengths to blend physical and digital visuals in a way that remains respectful to the wildly adventurous creations of Rob Bottin in Carpenters film. So, aesthetically The Thing ticks almost every box, which then makes it all the more a shame that this prequel is so in love with the 1980′s story, that it creates so few of it's own ideas leaving a shell that's little more than a join-the-dots rehash. 3/5",The Thing
487,railton_63103,More in comon with Aliens than a prequel to Carpenter's movie,7,15 December 2019,"While I enjoy the movie, I agree with a lot of critics that the film is more special effects then character driven. Where the original 1982's movie was a great combination of both.Indeed 2011's ""The Thing"" reminded me more of 1986's ""Aliens"" than Carpenter's movie. Only at the end does it really feels it leads to the 1982's flim.However, it's an exciting action/horror flim worth watching, at least once.",The Thing
488,JGDragov,Movie done with great respect for source material,8,8 October 2017,"I didn't go see The Thing in 2011 for two reasons. One, I was reluctant to support a prequel when what I had really wanted for thirty years was a sequel. Two, the movie seemed to have vanished from the theaters only after a few weeks. In the meantime, I only heard negative things(no pun intended) about this film so I didn't feel like I was missing out.However, something really weird happened when I finally caught it on HBO. I liked it! No, I mean I really liked it. To be clear, the criticisms about it being an unnecessary and almost too similar story to John Carpenter's classic are all fair. And, like most sic-fi movies today, there is more cgi than I would care to see. But the people making this movie clearly worship Carpenter's movie every bit as much as any die hard Thing fan. They go to great lengths to match up to the events suggested from the 1982 version and I personally appreciate them doing so. I also liked their method of detecting who was the Thing. It was different than MacReady's test but it was original.(Nothing will ever top the petri dish sequence and dialogue, Carpenter and Russell just nail it).If you're a fan of the original looking for something completely different or a ""new take"" on The Thing From Another world, than this movie is not for you. But if you're like me, and always wondered who put that ax through the door or what events led up to the two-headed thing burnt up in the snow at the Norwegion compound than I highly recommend this flick.",The Thing
489,keithwimmer,very good sci fi that was done by people that really loved the previous book and the early 50's and 82 version,7,5 May 2016,"I am a big fan of this version of the ""Thing"" monster. It is one of the most hideous monsters ever dreamed up for science fiction readers and movie goers. Imagine yourself being pierced, chocked, bled, strangled and then dissolved by millions of alien cells that would create a you replica after you were horribly killed. ""The Thing"" deserves that title. It has to be quite disturbing, yet imaginatively fascinating to those people that love sci fi and horror.This version tells the story of what happens just days before John Carpentar's 1982 version. Try to see it that way and don't compare. An American female paleontologist is requested to come to an Antarctic Science Station to help with what is an incredible organism buried in ice. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays this role fits right in there as a well trained and serious young scientist. She warns about taking precautions. Precautions are rarely taken in sci fi movies. One can question many things about this movie. And this one in that respect, is more under the microscope because of the 82 version. I went to see this one on the opening day and I really enjoyed it. I actually bought the DVD and it's one of my favorites to pull off the shelf at times. It's really interesting to watch this version and then watch the 82 version right after. Someday they might be able to come out with another ""Thing"". I could see ways they could do it.I don't think we would ever see a "" Alien versus the Thing"" If they did it would probably make 400 million the first weekend.But seriously this is a very good movie involving what I think is the scariest monster ever dreamed up for science fiction.

It's 29 years later (although I'm writing this review in 2020), and Hollywood still cannot produce anything close to something decent in comparison. They think over-the-top CGI is the answer.

Because you can't just make a better version of the classic,well known,best horror film ever.It does its job well and tells another wiew to the story.

This film is not want to be better and made a great respect to the original The thing.What I really like this film that the creators payed attancion to the details, such as the first deformed 'double-faced' body what they found in the original movie. Why left the axe on the wall, and what I really liked, that they found a different method, to find out who's who, not copying the blood test method from the original!I just wondered what heppened with Kate at the end? Went to the other base: ""Hi guys, we have just found an alien what killed everybody, but don't do anything, Kurt Russel will handle it tomorrow"".As a low budget film the CGI is good enough, still using puppets what made it more realistic, the actors are good, the film is just exciting.",The Thing

No real build up to understand what 'The Thing' is and how it wreaks havoc. Too many scenes of running and hiding from monsters - this is not what the The Thing is meant to be about. It's not trying to compete with the movie 'Aliens,' The Thing is more about paranoia and hopelessness than terror.The 2011 version is not a third of the 1982 version, and hardly worth watching.

This really is a unique, ego-less effort that builds around the 1982 film, which i place on a very short list of 'perfect' movies (and apparently so do the filmmakers).For those who might be concerned about the 'mixed' professional reviews, have a look at the NYTimes' review of John Carpenter's masterpiece by the esteemed Vincent Canby:http://goo.gl/0rO06Let's here it for The Establishment, eh?I scored it 8/10 as a stand alone film, and that feels slightly rounded-down.

If it wanted to be a prequel in the honest integral fashion it should have been 100% Norwegian, cast, language and narrative. If the producers had had the pineapples to do that then it could have worked, and worked well. What we get is a mish mash of a film wanting to tell us how John Carpenter's classic got to its own beginnings. No thanks.

501,MovieReviewPerson,Too Many Errors (Spoilers for both 1982 and 2011),3,16 November 2020,"There are many issues I have with 2011's THE THING.But I will start with what I found to be good about the film:
The axe scene is cool. If only for like 5 seconds.The CGI (while still terrible) did creep me out a little bit. Especially the melding scene.Destroying the controls of the original spaceship that crash landed on the planet was a good idea and could explain why the creature does not attempt to go for that ship in the 1982 film (although how would the 1982 film's creature know about this?).The bad:
There are numerous continuity errors that I'm sure multiple people have pointed out by now (like how the Norwegians used thermite charges to uncover the ship, the creature not disconnecting its limbs in crucial scenes, how the burnt skeleton that was outside next to the 'corpse' of the splitting face beast was missing, etc.) so I'll skip those.The introduction of picking someone from outside the Norwegian Antarctic team and bringing them in. Part of what made the 1982 film so scary was that it felt like no one in the outside world was aware of the danger yet. By having all communications knocked out in the area and a massive storm approaching, it felt like the American team in the 1982 film were really on their own and had to handle this situation before it reached civilization. It would also explain why the Norwegians were unable to notify/warn them as well. By having the time to get outside help, shouldn't someone like (for example) the military have caught wind of what was happening and sent a team down? I know the Norwegians were trying to keep it secret, but surely if you're bringing in people from other countries, either countries' government might notice something.The helicopter crash. With the 1982 film, it felt like the Thing was contained to an isolated area for the most part. This containment was what made the stakes so high. But with 2011's helicopter crash this RUINS the core idea of containment. Sure the Thing in the helicopter could have burnt up in the crash, but we saw how well that worked for the spaceship. By not addressing it, we can only make assumptions about what happened. Now maybe this was a setup for a sequel with the Russian camp, but I think it's just a major plot hole to the story.All in all I was just annoyed from start to finish while watching it.
I just wish the film was better.
Thank you for reading.",The Thing

Having at the core the 100000 years ship crashed in the frozen north pole, the story illustrates the human behavior when confronted with a life threatening danger. As we go deeper in the movie's plot we encounter the lack of trust between humans and their desperate try to survive. The tension was well kept during most scenes, the main character, Kate keeping up with the threatening alien brought to life by humans' thirst of knowledge. Except her final fight on the space ship when the scene was a bit stretched out in a Hollywood movie style : Kate escapes the beast hiding behind a wall far enough so the alien couldn't reach her and, at the same time, allowing her to grab the explosive. Despair remains true in the final scene, human race it's still in danger as we see the dog running through the north's snow. The conditions for making a new ""The Thing"" movie are well accomplished. Very nice settings , the cast was not very appropriate when will we see a sequel? Good movie",The Thing

I'm all for an ""Aliens""-esque Thing movie where action is a key element but there still needs to be a good story. It's not here. And whats more disappointing is that this movie has a lot going for it: a great international cast, great set pieces and cinematography, and a very interesting monster. But the story is so shallow that all of these positive contributors are not able to compose a movie that's as enjoyable as it should be.And finally while the filmmakers did establish a lot of superficial continuities to Carpenter's ""The Thing"", a far more important continuity was lost: the personality and attributes of the monster itself.I recommend seeing John Carpenter's ""The Thing"".

That being said, this movie is not bad on its own. The movie did a good job of staying true to the feeling of the first one: the paranoia of not knowing who is really the Thing, the creepiness of being in a remote area of the world where help is extremely far away, and of having the Thing be the person you least expect. The movie also does a good job of tying in with the original.Beyond that I can't say much about this movie, I definitely enjoyed it and I would suggest my friends to go watch it.

508,ohfishyfishyfish,A poor replica.,2,24 February 2012,"A poor replica I'll accept that this was never going to get a completely fair chance, being set against the Carpenter classic, but... they had to expect those comparisons. All excuses aside, it really is a poor movie. As a big fan of The Thing I was looking forward to a campy remake-prequel, and I was expecting something at least fun. I sat down to watch, realising I probably wouldn't appreciate it as much as the Carpenter one, but that it would at least be an enjoyable experience nonetheless.Perhaps I didn't like that the film took itself very seriously. Not even Carpenter took his version that seriously. Pardon me if I'm a sick individual, but there's some comedic value in someone's chest opening up and biting someone's arms off. There were a few nods and winks to the 1982 version, like the director deciding it'd be fun to do some scenes EXACTLY THE SAME. ""Oh really? Stand around in a circle while the alien burns in the snow? Oh? You're going to have a little test at flamethrower-point? Oh gosh, and the flamethrower's not working at a critical point?! DAMN THESE UNRELIABLE THINGS (one little thing during that scene; Lars threatens the blonde American by putting his flamethrower right up to his face. I'm no flamethrower expert, but he probably shouldn't be that close. Now that I think about it, this could have been intentional, to be so stupid as to get a laugh. If there were meant to be laughs, I think they played their hand with a bit too much poker face).What grabbed me in the 1982 version was the atmosphere, the tension, and the sense of paranoia, causing in-fighting among the group. Very, very little of that here. The alien seems to step in and out of the movie to inject a little more life onto the screen, then fade out before anything too interesting happens. It doesn't give the film time to build a sense of tension. Maybe the tension's just lost on me, since a whole string of scenes were lifted directly from the Carpenter version, I knew exactly what they were going to do, and it only occasionally took a slightly different route towards the same outcome.They messed around with the ability of the alien. This might just be me, but I always thought when the alien is transforming, it's supposed to be slow and at its most vulnerable. That's why it only attacks when it's alone with someone. In this version, when the alien transforms, it runs, it sprints, and it throws tentacles in all directions. If it's that powerful in its transitional form, why does it even need to change its shape? Sure, when they have flamethrowers, keep the fact that you're an alien under your hat, but if you're in a room with 5 guys and none of them are armed with some kind of large fiery weapon, you can just gobble them up.Did anyone else think the black American constantly had a look in his eyes that he was about to do something stupid? Whenever the camera zoned in on him, I had to say ""Whatever it is you're thinking, don't do it"", then he does. Quite a funny property in a character. Being that stupid is far more interesting than any of the other characters. Although I liked that the British guy was far too suspicious to actually be guilty, like in a Scooby-Doo cartoon.But what really, really irked me most of all, and took away the sense of fun for me was the special effects. The effects in the old version were hand-made; they were creepy, because they looked organic. You could also feel the love in these wondrous creations because they were a labour of the hands, and of the ingenuity of the film makers. The puppet effects were like a magician's trick; you just sit and wonder how they did that. The CGI just kills that sense of wonder because I just think to myself ""the computer did it for them"". The CGI just looks out of place among the living world, and like the alien, I find inorganic material difficult to swallow.Overall the film is of little-to-no-value. The only real love I can feel that's put into this film is when they're doing the slight nods and winks to the previous version. These come in the guise of just recreating scenes and moments from the older ones. Did we really need to see those scenes recreated? It's just a poor replica; this time the insidious alien creature swallowed up a substandard action film and took on its form in hopes to isolate, and absorb its prey. Perhaps this one shouldn't make it all the way to civilisation. Try not to spread it around and we'll all be fine.",The Thing
509,jason618,Tired beats and no character development,4,13 October 2011,"Going in I had high hopes - The Thing is my number one favorite movie and the idea of a prequel had me excited. But alas, where the original had such a wonderful build with a barely seen creature, here we have dodgy CGI early on showing it in it's not so great glory. (A helicopter sequence had me cringing in my seat but for all the wrong reasons). Sadly it took me out my movie going experience I never got it back. The filmmakers seriously could have saved a few hundred grand in CGI and gone for the less is more approach rather than the SYFY channel style of creature feature beats. That said, I wasn't offended by it and the actors did what they could with essentially card-board cut-outs. Stick a dozen people in an isolated arctic base and there's a wonderful opportunity for odd-ball characters with loads of quirks. This is not that movie. No characters arcs, giant leaps in character ""thought process"" to speed through plot holes but some okay suspense beats with a pace that's not painful and some nice gruesomeness for what felt like a PG-13 rating.

I think director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. did a great job in recreating the atmosphere of the Carpenter masterpiece. If i didn't knew better i would have thought it was a prequel by Carpenter himself. The actors are great, in particular Mary Elizabeth Winstead, she gave a great performance as Kate Lloyd. The special effects didn't go over the top (what could have ruined the movie) and they provided a lot of really scary and intense scenes. So don't believe the stories about a failed remake.

The director realized he couldn't improve on Carpenter's movie & made a prequel instead. In the '82 movie, the alien is more calculating and chooses his prey more carefully because it tried a full onslaught in the Norwegian camp and lost several times.

512,naruana,An Excellent Companion Piece to a Classic Masterpiece,8,19 October 2011,"Part of the advertising campaign for The Thing touted it as from the producers of Dawn of the Dead. While this sort of Hollywood trope is usually meaningless, here is the exception. Like the remake of Romero's classic, die-hard purists who were never going to like anything less than what John Carpenter gave them will hate it, most fans will love it, and the average movie goer/horror buff should enjoy the hell out of it.First things first: this is NOT a remake. Don't let anyone tell you different: it's a prequel, and that is fact.The story takes place days before JC's original story (which was actually a remake), at a different research base, with different characters and different events. Any similarities are simply the result of the subject matter. Familiar shots are homages, not lazy rip-offs. The story is that of the Norwegians who found the thing and its crashed ship, and what happens to them.It certainly delivers, and should satisfy fans of the original. The acting is at worst, good, with the best performances coming from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Joel Edgerton. The best acting comes out in the paranoid scenes that make this movie and its predecessor so terrifying. But that's not to overlook the thing itself. It's as creepy and disturbing as ever. Practical effects were enhanced with CGI, providing a faster creature than some may remember, and that may initially be off-putting. But it makes for some terrifying scenes. Fans will enjoy seeing all the ties and connections to JC's movie, and be sure to stay through the first part of the credits for the pay-off. This movie treads new and familiar ground, staying fresh enough to be relevant while staying true to the story. Go see it, and if you haven't, see John Carpenter's movie as well.",The Thing

Being someone that hate's hoity toity artsy folks, the fact that even -I- appreciate the artistic nature is really saying something.This movie was made for the fans. Everything about it was painstakingly put together as to preserve the story of The Thing (1982). This was done to such an extent, that it probably will alienate the general audience. For a film studio to green light something targeted at a small audience... well that's nothing short of a miracle. In fact I think it's a monumental step forward for Hollywood!There are no love triangles, no typical tropes, no air of mystery was toyed with, and no scientists played by a Baldwin brother can be heard shouting ""I told you so"" at the end. It's a pure and devoted prequel that gives a fan more of the world he loves without trying to change it.Hopefully this movie will bring the general audience back to The Thing (1982) and they can join us in our appreciation.",The Thing
514,dexterharley,The straight truth...............,9,19 October 2011,"If you are reading this, there is a very good chance that the reason you are is because you are a huge fan of the 1982 version of THE THING. I believe most hardcore fans had the same mixed feelings I did, of excitement and apprehension upon hearing news of a prequel in the making. There were about 10,000 different ways to royally screw this movie up, at every turn, to the point of blasphemy. By contrast, there were only a few ways to make the movie the right way. Against all odds they did it right. I am actually amazed it turned out as well as it did. No the movie is not perfect, but most of the negative reviews all compare it to the John Carpenter version. What are these people expecting? SERIOUSLY???? Lets get one thing straight............ IF JOHN CARPENTER MADE THE THING TODAY,IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THE 1982 VERSION! Yes, we all know the planets aligned for him back then with a great cast, Ennio's brilliant score and Rob Bottin with his amazing effects. But doing it today with CGI at your disposal, a bigger budget, and probably more unwanted input from the studio than in 1982 (due to a much bigger investment) it would be different. It was a moment in time. John's vision of it today may not even be the same.....If you WANT the John Carpenter version, throw it in the DVD and get your popcorn (as I have done dozens of times myself) and enjoy. Trying to make a companion piece 30 years later without butchering it is quite a feat. I believe this was done with reverence and just the right amount of originality. I LOVED IT. Being a die hard Sci-fi fan, I usually have to take what I can get, as most Sci-fi movies these days just plain suck. But this was great and I applaud the director for making a good movie and for the studio for taking a chance... ( in case I need to remind anyone that the 1982 version was neither loved by critics at the time, or much of a financial success.) In fact MOST of the critics that are slamming this movie would do the same to Carpenters version if it came out today, just as they did in 1982. Naysayers aside, I believe that years from now this movie may become more widely accepted and may even reach cult status , but will probably never be as revered as Carpenters version....................",The Thing
515,cumb101,A great movie that is much better than everyone is letting on.,8,18 October 2011,"OK, firstly lets get the whole ""big fan of the 1982 version"" thing out of the way. Because I am, a huge fan and everything.The 1982 version of The Thing was and still is my favourite Sci-Fi horror film, mixing really good tension and gore in a unique setting with a monster that defied imagination (for a 13 year old that watched it on VHS). I still watch it on average once per year, enjoying every sickening moment of it. It was the film I would invite ignorant friends over to watch just to see the expressions on their faces when all the crazy things happen on screen.Now it is 2011, and someone decided to once and for all let us learn what exactly happened to the other base. In reality, it was obvious what had occurred since the American crew investigate the place anyway, and after watching the original anyone can clearly come to an obvious conclusion. They would be right too. But still a prequel was made and created with all the modern film making tricks in their books. Namely sharp cuts, excessive music in places and a good deal of CGI.The other fans who have seen this new film have all completely treated it like the movie was cancer, criticising the special effects, acting, characters, plot and everything else they can think of. The main concern is that it is not enough like the original. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, so good for them. The one thing people forget though, is that the John Carpenter original was criticised for the exact same things, but that didn't stop it from becoming a classic. Seriously, who do you remember well from the original apart from the Doc, MacReady and Childs?This film, in my opinion is a fantastic prequel. While the CGI does become a little thick at times, such as the scene with the final Thing, and the characters are only there for the body count, it is still a fantastic horror film. Also, the scenes of paranoia aren't as heavy in this version, though that really isn't a complaint since these are different people dealing with the same situation. What I loved though is everything else. The monster reveals and designs, the excessive gore, the interesting choice for a lead and the fact that the writers and director went out of their way to tie everything into the original nicely. No matter what everyone else says, there is still tension, paranoia, insane gore, and a fun cast trying to deal with the craziness. Is it better than the original? No.Does it make a great lead up to the events of the American base? Yes.Just give it time, people will realise its qualities later, much like the original, and start enjoying it then.-Kalem",The Thing

On that note: What happened to making an outline of the ship in the snow??? They did it in both previous movies.Why is the Thing moving at light speed in this movie?

I feel it should have been a Norwegian story, as Carpenter's film suggested.The young lady was attractive, and the actors were serviceable for their roles. The creature effects were incongruent with Carpenter's monster, but not so badly so that it was unacceptable. Why the hell would you call in a Paleontologist for an alien corpse/spacecraft?

520,puyen58,Utter disappointment.,1,17 October 2011,"There are too many major story discontinuities in this film with relation to the 1982 version, and that is unacceptable, especially when the director supposedly had ""millions"" of screen-shots from the Carpenter movie to work with. Some of the scenes that really tie in the movie to Carpenter's version came as an afterthought AFTER the credits began to roll at the end. That made it seem cheap and amateurish, like the director and producer didn't really care. Something about the whole film made it seem sloppy. It's hard to put a finger on it but it just didn't come together very well.I won't go into how horrible the CGI fest was. And it was a total CGI fest. They promised this would be 70% practical and 30% CGI. So much for that. It was all a lie.",The Thing
521,krayzkrok,Not disappointed,9,3 April 2012,"Like many I'm a huge fan of Carpenter's 1982 version, and I hold Howard Hawkes' version in high regard as well. There's something about an unpredictable alien terror hiding within those near you that chills my bones. I hoped fervently that this 2011 version would do the story justice, and was disappointed to read the mixed reviews following its release.Well I'm pleased to say I hugely enjoyed this version, watched in ideal conditions in a dark room and a great sound system. The movie does a highly effective job at creating an atmosphere of tension and distrust, and while a lot of the ""creature"" moments are telegraphed in advance (with a couple of notable exceptions) they are inventive and for the most part a highly effective combination of practical and CG effects that do great justice to Rob Bottin's classic work on the 1982 version. I think there are many who write off the creature effects simply because they incorporate CG, but CG has reached the stage where these effects can be pulled off believably and for the most part they succeed admirably. I haven't felt like hiding behind the sofa for a long, long time but this movie nearly got me there.The respect that the director and crew pay towards the Carpenter version is clear to see, and great attention has gone into maintaining continuity between the way the Norwegian camp was portrayed and the events that happened there. It's close enough to be a believable piece of continuity, and that's important in not negatively affecting our view of the 1982 version.It's not perfect, and I could pick holes in the final reel which loses a bit of momentum and the claustrophobic feel, but like Carpenter's version it was saved by the final resolution.This movie clearly divides opinion, but I'm just glad that I happened to be one of the huge Thing fans that loved it. I doubt any remake will ever approach the genius of Carpenter's version, which still stands up well today, but this is a commendable effort and any lover of great horror movies should check it out.",The Thing
522,losttactic,Entertaining but felt rushed,7,24 November 2011,"Obviously I've seen John Carpenter's The Thing and it's my personal favourite horror film of all time. This prequel was never going to be as good as that, and nobody should expect it to be going in. Where this film does succeed is in entertainment, you sort of get everything you like from The Thing but in a condensed form, for some who just want 90mins of entertainment and scares you'll love it as it's goes at a good pace, for those looking for the great character building and acting from Carpenter's classic, you'll be disappointed. That said, as an independent film I liked it and was thoroughly entertained, certainly the best Alien type film in a long time (AVP franchise was awful), 7.5/10 imo.",The Thing
523,metinbektas83,Psychological elements came too short,6,26 November 2011,"The storyline of ""The Thing"" provides a perfect platform for psychological elements. Unfortunately the film focuses too much on action and shock. This leaves the viewer little room to develop a feeling of paranoia or anxiety and turns a potentially outstanding film into a Hollywood standard. The film also lacked authenticity. It would have been more believable if it was completely in Norwegian (with English subtitles) and if the scientist would not turn into a ""female Bruce Willis"" in a matter of minutes.The reason why I still give it 6 of 10 points is because it was, despite the shortcomings, entertaining and I felt the acting was rather good. And as a science fiction fan, I obviously liked the storyline.If you are simply looking for a movie to pass the time, if you like action-films and/or you are into the sci-fi-genre, then this movie will do. If you are looking for a movie to ""wow"" you, then keep looking.",The Thing
524,caghosthunter90,Do not see this movie,1,3 March 2012,"This was a bad movie. The story was bad, nothing was tied together or made any sense what so ever, the action was boring. the movie dose a good job at starting a thought and never finishing it. Why did the ice melt in the middle of Antarctica, How did the three men at the start of the film get out of the crack in the ice? How did the dead alien spread? Etc Etc. on top of that Mary Elizabeth Winstead had the emotional range of a peace of wood never once did I get the feeling that she was scared during any point of this movie.

525,raphiedaman69,Very solid,8,28 October 2011,"The best part of the first film was the paranoia and when everyone started suspecting each other of being the Thing. This movie does have that but not as much. Instead it shows how the Thing actually got to the dog that we see in the first film. The prequel is does an excellent job of the tie-ins to the first movie and is really cool to see how things got like that. The actual scenes with the Thing are cool and it doesn't look too fake, although I wish they would not have done CG for it. Even though it has some lacking in the tension department that the first one created, it makes up for it in the action and one scene was right out of the game Deadspace (which was friggin sweet). If you're going into this film thinking its going to be as good as the first you're going to be disappointed, but it is still a solid horror movie with solid acting and some really cool action scenes. Well worth the money, esp considering that almost no horror movies are coming out.",The Thing
526,jker101,Great move,10,17 December 2011,"I only wanted to contribute a review because recently Hollywood has become limp with fresh ideas. For them to make a prequel as oppose to a remake or sequel is very much appreciated. As a fan of the John carpenter version I really was anticipating this movie for quite sometime and it was worth the wait. The film begins with the same feel you open up with in the 1982 version and even the music is respected. A great ensemble of actual Swedish actors and actress really authenticate this untold story. Without spoilers being given, all questions and curiosities are fulfilled in this picture. All and all the sets and feel of Antarctica are very much acceptable as the constant snow and wind remind you that the cold chill running down your back is just you imagination. I recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of horror films it's got it all gore, betrayal, and induces only more curiosity for fans of this shape shifting franchise . A gush more than a review...",The Thing
527,FilmOholic_1,"Solid Horror Movie, Tense, and Engaging",9,16 October 2011,"First, I really don't understand many of the negative comments on this film (lack of suspense, doesn't match up with the 1982 version, lack of character development, etc). This movie is a worthy successor to both the 1951 and 1982 versions. Carpenter's film is called a classic by many, but that is simply ridiculous. The Carpenter film was good a horror film, but had more flaws than this one. This new version, though a prequel, can stand on it's own, but I found it to be well-acted, suspenseful, a solid soundtrack, characters that I cared about, and top- rated special effects. Were there flaws, yes, but no more than the previous versions. And the CGI for the most part was excellent. The Carpenter version's stop motion is really dated today, and CGI gives it a far more realistic look. Sure there were some CGI elements that were not the best but compared to the dated 1982's effects, it still came off better. Mary Elizabeth Winstead turned in a good performance, as did most of the cast. I also enjoyed the tie in to the 1982 version as well at the end. Overall, this was very enjoyable film, but I do wish it had been a complete remake and a bit longer. It did seem a bit rushed, when better tension could have been developed by extending those moments in the film where the paranoia begins to set in. If you enjoy a good horror movie, go see it. Ignore the naysayers who have way too much fealty to the earlier version.",The Thing

A lot better.,7,2 December 2011,"At first I had low expectations for this movie, re-boots and remakes rarely surpass the original and this is still the case although it is not bad movie at all. The director has managed to keep suspense high throughout the movie, though i found the climatic sequence to be a huge let down. In my opinion the movie was worth the ride just to get to the post credits sequence which shot for shot could have easily been directed by Carpenter himself. Overall a good film, when coupled with John Carpenters it becomes a decent addition to the series, however for people new to the franchise i would recommend watching this one first then Carpenters.",The Thing

Don't see how anybody could complain about this movie. Very Very well done. A+ in my book. Only wish that there is someway they can make The Thing 3. That would be nice. Bring back Kurt Russell and Keith David to reprise there roles. That would be nice. Oh well time will tell. I think it should go something like this. Pick up from The Thing 1982 were Kurt and Keith are warming themselves by the fire. Then they decide to rewire one of the vehicles to get it to run just enough to were they can drive it and keep warm. They head to another outpost were they find a group of scientists and anyone from The Thing 2011. Sorry no spoilers from me. Well they tell there story to the scientists which think they are completely nuts. Low and behold, the night before a rouge dog wanders into the camp (kinda like the 1st movie but lets say there were actually 2 dogs or a dog from the 1982 version that actually escaped) the night before. And then the strange things start happening. And yada yada yada. Think it would be a good start. I don't need no critics cause I ain't a writer so just open your minds and feel it out and add opinions to what you think Part3 should be like. Don't criticize my idea. Thanks",The Thing
530,jtorrieri94,letdown,3,23 February 2012,"I am a huge fan of The Thing (1982). One of the most creepiest well done effects ever in a horror film. This ""prequel"" lacked a lot. one thing it lacked was no suspense whatsoever instead of hiding this creature goes on a rampage as soon as it breaks out of the ice. At times the effects were pretty good ( for CG standards of course practical effects is always better)But when the guy in the helicopter splits his face open it looks like a unfinished effect. Yes it looked that bad. unlike the carpenter film most of the characters (except for like 3) are forgettable and you wont care if they live or die. The worst part is that Kate lives at the end. not that shes horrible but she lives because the filmmakers wanted somewhat of a happy ending, since Kate is not in the 1982 film she should have been killed. they only connect the 2 film at the end credits and it also helped that they played the chilling theme from the carpenter film. If you really like The Thing then give it a watch, but don't hope it will be as good at the 1982 film.",The Thing
531,lav72,LOVED it!!!,8,15 October 2011,"I am a HUGE fan of John Carpenter's 1982 remake of The Thing. It was with mild trepidation...mostly curiosity as to how this version would be made...that I went to see this new version. I was SO happy with it that I had to say (and there will be SPOILERS) that this movie REALLY provided real insight for me as to what really happened at the Norwegian camp. First off: did this movie need to be made? That's a big no. But was it worth it? Hell yes!!! It was as intense as you can get! I loved the fact that they played this one so well, knowing they were setting up the story that happened almost 30 years ago (but only a couple of days in the movie). Of course, as much as I loved the movie, there were a few issues I had with it. Here's where the spoilers come in: for starters, they showed WAAAAAAY too much of the creatures. A little less would have been a lot more (except for the scenes with the thing under the compound building and the scene where the thing exposes itself in an airborne helicopter). As for the thing, there wasn't as much creativity as to what it looked like versus the thing(s) from the 1982 version. Each creature looked a lot like the one before it, so that took a little away. Then, you have the ship. If you remember from the video footage, all the members of that camp stood around the ship with thermite charges. There was no indication of that in this movie. Instead, the ship itself destroys that outer layer of ice surrounding it. No continuity there. As for the tension of the film, there was plenty of it. What there wasn't enough of was paranoia. No one seemed as frightened in this movie as they did in the 1982 version. Do not take what I say negatively as me saying this wasn't a good movie. There was plenty that made me feel uncomfortable enough. The way this thing attacked people made me squirm plenty! It happens so fast that you just may not have the time to realize that it's happening! Mary Elizabeth Winstead was a great cast role! Joel Edgerton and Ulrich Thomsen were also just what the acting needed. As for everyone else, they filled their roles very well and helped to make the story move just as smoothly as it needed to! Lastly, and this is important... The credits must be watched! There is a fantastic few scenes as the credits begin that you do NOT want to miss...especially for the fans of Carpenter's masterpiece!",The Thing
532,syziph,The Thing Universe is Expanding!,10,22 October 2011,"""The Thing"" movies deal with one of the best concept for alien life-form ever presented in motion pictures. This movie stands on its own both for a story and suspense and yet seamlessly integrates in the storyline for the Carpenter's movie. It answers some of the questions about the Thing and still leaves questions unanswered enough for making nowadays ""The Thing"". My sincere respect to all involved in making of this movie. The cast acting is great (except if you think a clever talk means a good acting).And finally reading most of the negative reviews I can advice those who haven't seen the movie yet:If you want to ""bond"" with a character - go see a Drama. If you like slow paced films - go watch a movie for a friendly alien. If you don't like CG in movies - why you bother watching such movies?

533,malcanta-185-177599,Stayed True to Original,9,14 October 2011,"While keeping incredibly close to and true to the original John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", this film also does enough new little things to make it not a complete remake. I highly advise watching the original before, as you will be amazed at all the stuff that is mentioned and referenced, so then you can exclaim in the cinema ""OOOOHHHHHH YEEEAAAH I remember this from the original!"".The way The Thing killed was pretty much the same in the original, but they did change it up a bit and gave you a little of little hints of who was ""The Thing"". Every time it was revealed surprised me and made me appreciate the movie more.The ending was incredible. could not have asked for a better ending. if you remember how the original began, well, it does what you would be hoping for. everything tied in, and everyone clapped at the end.The way the characters are seen as and where they go will always keep you guessing on who is infected. the graphics are incredible, and some scenes are incredibly creepy and graphic. I feel that there was a lot more tension in this film, which was a good thing, as without it would have felt more like a remake rather than a prequel, and I can safely say, that this movie was an insane eye-popping prequel.If you like the original, you will most likely like this film. I know I did, I only had one or two SMALL gripes with it, but those only arose after an intense 1 hour nerd discussion. the film tied in perfectly and the small hints and tips were incredibly well placed and given, and will keep you and your friends talking for hours after the movie ends.",The Thing

535,lepperling,"Call me optimistic and kind, but I actually liked it.",9,15 October 2011,"This movie has been out for like 2 days and all I've read are reviews from those self-proclaimed ""loyal fans of the original"" (and by original, I don't mean ""The Thing From Another World"") that feel betrayed or disappointed or whatever. I myself happen to be a student of ""old-school"" horror and I am DEFINITELY a loyal fan of Carpenter's classic, and I thought that this movie held strong for itself. It's like all those people out there that complain that ""The Godfather Part 3"" was terrible, when in reality it was a good movie on its own. Compared to the rest of the series it was weak, but, like this movie, was good on its own. Yes, we get it. Its not the original. It doesn't keep the creature out of sight as much. Okay, get over it. Keeping the audience guessing was ""in"" in the late 70s/early 80s, and I loved that. Thats why it worked in ""The Thing"", ""Alien"", etc. But its 2011, and as much as I miss the suspense and guessing games of those times, we're in a new era where films sadly use more CG and flashy scenes than character development (by the way, where was the superb character development in the original? both films are HORROR movies about a group of people we know nothing about as we watch them try to survive. Did we really ever learn anything about Kurt Russell's family? or what Keith David's favorite football team was?) and good old Savini/Baker-esque special effects. But this movie, in my opinion, was made for those ""loyal fans"" that,while watching the first film, were saying ""Wow, I'd love to know what happened at this Norwegian camp before Kurt Russell got here!"" And it did just that. It led right up to the events of the first film, while telling a separate, while similar, interesting story. It explained minute details from the first film that we were left wondering about. It recreated the Norwegian camp as viewed in the first film. It did everything in its power to remain true to the first film, while also giving us a reason to pay and see a NEW MOVIE. In our day and age, where it seems like every other horror movie that comes out is a remake of a classic from years ago (due to lack of original ideas?), its nice to see a prequel instead of a remake. Its nice to see a movie that tries to tell an original story, while keeping just enough elements in there to hook loyal fans of the original film. If you're going to the theater to watch Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (which it seems like all these 'loyal fans of the original' were expecting, though I don't know why...), then don't see it. If you loved Carpenter's film and want to see a fun N-E-W story that perhaps answers some questions you've wanted answered, then see this. Remember, its not Carpenter's film and its not trying to be. Its another movie, just giving a bit of an homage to Carpenter's classic.",The Thing
536,Konra45,Your modern day horror crap,3,15 October 2011,"This movie was a disappointment in many ways. From everything to the CGI to the concept of the alien. It's not that the CGI was ""bad"", they were moderately good, but I personally felt like it didn't fit in with the movie. But if you're not too picky on the graphics, then you won't be disappointed in this area.But, if you're any kind of fan of the class (and possibly the best horror film ever) John Carpenter's version, then you will probably feel very disappointed in many other ways. The ""horror"" was your modern day pop up scary, but not true terror that Carpenter gave us. Some scenes were creepy and grotesque, but nothing too unbearable, or original. This movie had a lot of potential to make new ways for the creature to deform it's human remake, but you can tell that the writter was too lazy to think of anything new. Not only could you see that they remade what Carpenter created, but it was almost every time the thing revealed itself, it seemed to have the same form. The concept of the alien is also a disappointment compared to the original. In the 1982 The Thing, the idea for when the Thing revealed itself was when it had no escape, which was the whole intensity of the classic. But, rather than keeping that feel, the Thing turned out to be a mindless creature that tried luring in it's ""prey"", and I use that word lightly. The other concept the 1982 The Thing that was ingenious was the blood! It felt as though, in this movie, once they figured it had to do with the blood, the movie just stopped focusing on it, and focused more on what the creature actually did, which takes out that entire concept. Although, it was somewhat entertaining to see the connection between the movies at the end, but it also felt they just threw that in at the last moment, and they don't even explain where the dog came from (SPOILER: the dog basically explodes on the beginning, so how does it come back??? Oh, and it's not the same type of dog in the original, so that's kind of weird)There were very MANY other flaws within the movie, and was huge disappointment to the classic. This would be considered a decent modern day horror, but considering that it's in the universe of John Carpenter's The Thing, this was a failure.",The Thing
537,derrickmeadows-ny,Superb,10,16 October 2011,"I must say that the only shortcoming of this movie is the soundtrack. Marco Beltrami can do well (e.g. 'Knowing') but after all, it's impossible for every motion picture to have Ennio Marricone as the composer. 'The Thing' is a thriller - it's supposed to arouse fear of uncertainly and distrust which is accomplished through subtle means. Carpenter's movie soundtrack is legendary, so, perhaps just to honor its caliber, Beltrami should have imitated the theme, instead of developing completely novel approach. However, it's also great to experience the contrast of themes at the end of this movie - when it evolves to The Thing 1983.The cast was an awesome decision. I so hoped they would avoid the cult of celebrity. The actors are great, but none of them hijack viewer's attention to the point when it's about the actor as opposed to the plot.Kudos to the screenplay, it deserves the highest rating. I'm not a big movie buff but I have not seen anyone so exceed the expectations for a prequel. Multiple details of Carpenter's film are developed: the axe they found on the site, the man in the chair, and the slab of ice which encased the thing until its escape. We get to see the double-face imitation - how it evolved - and how it was burned to be later found in Carpenter's version outside the station. And of course the last moments of the movie - where Marricone's soundtrack finally kicks in - show how consistent the plot is all throughout, how it gradually evolves to the point where you can just start watching The Thing 1983. The only thing I have not seen was the video tape made by the crew of how they discovered the ship, but I suppose it can be overlooked. Generally, there seemed to have been a logical, scientific (in Cameron's way) mind disposition toward plot development.Closer to the end, Kate gets to visit the alien ship - there is some similarity there to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley - which I don't welcome - but it doesn't last, so it's OK.As a final thought, it'd be great if Ennio himself composes a new soundtrack and then we get a new version of this movie. Otherwise - superb.Derrick",The Thing

Putting in his character to the audience as close to your situationPerhaps one of the fateful tape, is the lack of a charismatic hero or idol as it was Kurt Russell.While the special effects in The Thing of 1982 is known for its great and amazing special effects, the effects of this prequel will not be the most memorable but it looks that pays homage to some extent these effects made in 1982, although the CGI take much of the film, the effects are what carries the film better.Distrust of the group or the suffocating tension and suspense in certain parts of the footage has a great similarity to the atmosphere of Carpenter remember.The Thing of 2011 is a declaration of love from fans of the genre who turn in telling stories already familiar with the utmost respect to the original.The Thing of 1982 does not have a remake, a prequel is great.The best: Eric Heisserer The ability to catch when the original elements and combine them without any problem in this prequel.Worst: The long shadow of The Thing of 1982 and never leave a scene to remember.",The Thing
541,senyaw,We shouldn't be too critical of this film.,7,23 October 2011,"I saw The Thing yesterday at a matinée and honestly, it wasn't bad. Yes it's a little short on substance. Yes it's got a cast of pretty much no-names. Yes doesn't do a very good job of developing the characters. All that being said, it has a couple of things going for it.One is the special effects...this movie actually made me jump a few times in some of the scenes. It's been a long time since that's happened. The alien is one scary beast and is definitely a match for the effects in the 1982 version (of course, it ought to be with today's graphic capabilities). Secondly, this movie is the perfect compliment to it's ""sequel"". They were true to the original right down to what the Norwegian camp looked like after all the ruckus and also what the human and alien remains looked like when Copper and McReady went there. They even made the engines of the alien craft burn off all the snow on top of it ensuring it would look like it did when McReady and his mates found it. They did leave quite a few loose ends, but they were attentive to the big stuff which is more than some sequel-prequel movies can say.Bottom line, we shouldn't expect Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. to be John Carpenter. It's just not going to happen. This movie was certainly watchable and entertaining...not as good as Carpenter's but hey, how many sci-fi movies are as good as the '82 The Thing? I liked it and I'm ready to watch them back to back. Heck, maybe I'll watch the original after that just to see James Arness clobber the annoying scientist guy that tries to ""reason"" with him.Don't shy away from this one...just temper your expectations.",The Thing
542,argoth2002,Delivers just like the original,10,29 October 2011,"Quite a few harsh critics on here. I went to the theatre on this films opening day. I've actually watched the original 80's movie over 3 times now, and had high expectations for this film. First, the setting is dead on with the other film. When you review the untold story that Kurt Russell stumbled upon when he stopped by the Norwegian camp, it gives a sense of continuity. Whoever directed the film paid extremely close attention to everything that was revealed in the original film. It's insane!!! From the axe that was left inside of the wall to the two headed monster that Kurt Russell stumbled upon. You really feel immersed in this movie, wondering who the heck the thing is, and who it is not. One thing is clear, the Thing is more like a virus than a creature, and I found myself having a hard time trying to pet my cat afterwards because the movie creeped me out too much (Having a vivid imagination doesn't help). The movie is a monster movie, and a sci fi movie in a sense. Don't go there anticipating a lot of character development. You'll have a hard time deciphering who and where the Thing is, which is really what you should be going there to see to begin with.",The Thing
543,derkan,brilliant,10,31 October 2011,"OK in this year i was waiting for two remakes- Frigh Night and The Thing-its a preguel but anyway..its outstanding. Everyone complains about CGI effects- they are OK. Its not the old school of special effects like was in Return of Living Dead etc. But i think if in this movie would be such an effects everyone would complain "" gosh those effects are steping backwards"". Think in this way- The Thing old version is like Ridley's Scott's Alien. And The Thing prequel is like Cameron's Aliens. More action, more gore, more of everything. About storyline-its great. I don't wont to spoil anything but the ending is great. People who complains- you are like me who was raised on old school horror movies..but those times wont come back..never!!. So if you are a fan of Carpenters version just relax and enjoy..you wont be disappointed. :)",The Thing
544,levizilla,A fantastic prequel to Carpenter's classic.,9,21 November 2011,"I went into the theater to see this prequel quite skeptical. I wasn't sure if it was going to capture the same tone and feel of the 1982 film. I'm quite happy to say that I was wrong. I loved it. The use of special effects and CGI was top-notch. The lead,(Played by Rosie-Huntington Whitley) was a fantastic paradigm of the person who keeps a level head when things go to hell. The transformations were fantastically disturbing and fun to watch. The final fight with the Sander-Thing on the spacecraft was gripping and suspenseful. And when Juliette transforms, the way the creature is groaning and screaming is chilling in every sense of the word. Also, when Edvard transforms and assimilates Jonas and Adam, the genuine look of sheer terror and fear in their eyes is just too great and hard to miss. The credit-sequence is greatly done and explains everything and leads flawlessly into the 1982 film. I would've given this film a 10/10 like I did the original, but I found I didn't connect to the cast as well as I did in the 1982 film. But other than that small complaint, this film is great. Completely disregard the critics. They are paid to write bad reviews. If you are a true fan of The Thing, see this movie.",The Thing

I thought it was a remake, the typical Hollywood made and square one, but to my surprise it was not.Very good acted, magnificently well paced and tense... very tense the whole movie.This movie is a tribute to Carpenter's one, this movie gives a chance to go deeper in the original story... and amuses good! Actors, languages, scenarios are cool! I feel happy of daring to watch it.The end of the movie is the perfect end and took me thirty years ago, when a theater I could enjoy from the first time (of maybe ten ones more) Kurt Russel fighting a creature.",The Thing
546,cocodemunky,"Not perfect, but still fun!",8,24 January 2012,"I loved the first The Thing, easily in my top 3 favorite movies of all time, and I feel like this prequel did a great job. I remembered everything from the first movie, and was trying to tie it together in my head. ""Who is going to make it far enough to slit their wrists for us?"" ""Well now there is only one helicopter pilot who could possibly be the one to make it to the American base!"" etc etc. While still having some surprises(Carter not actually surviving and some other heli showing up).I initially didn't like the CG monsters, however I do feel that the monster designs were so cool, that if they tried to do it live-action they would have been altered because they were too complicated or moved too slowly.To people that say ""the﻿ original camp were all Norwegians and they didn't speak English, nor was there a black guy or a woman. I'm also pretty sure that Americans, African-Americans, and Australians don't come from Norway."": Almost the entire place burned to cinders, barely leaving a few rooms, while the Things were mutated on top of being burned. How could you tell what might have been a woman or man or specific race before it transformed/burned? Not to mention the whole fact that there's no way to know what language someone spoke before they died. If you watch the movie and see the scenes in the end credits, you see why the guys who make﻿ it to the original American base only speak Norwegian.Honestly, aside from a few small blips (for example, the ice block looks to be pretty obvious CG, which does seem like a weird thing to not practically make. Or the Edvard/Adam-Thing being similar, and a cool spin on the original Split-face-Thing, not ending up quite how the Americans find it in the 1982 version. Where the hell is Lars disappear to, and not get devoured, when the American's took him?)This is a very fun movie, and it's very obvious how huge of an effort they made to have it fit as closely as possible to the original.It's not perfect, nothing is, but it is very well done in this fan's opinion!",The Thing
547,steve699717,A good build up to the original.,8,25 January 2012,"It would appear that the film is constantly being compared to the '82 John Carpenter film, with die hard fans of that film dismissing this one.Being a massive fan of the original, I was a bit unsure how a prequel would play out, but I was quietly impressed with the effort and thought it gave a good account of how the 'Thing' was discovered. Let's not forget it was the original film that gave us the Dog, the thawed out ice pack, the 'two-headed' creature, the man with the cut wrists etc, and they have pretty much covered all the bases when it comes to setting the scene.It would appear that most are basing their assumptions on Macready's statement about the Thing's behaviour. However these were just assumptions by a helicopter pilot having read a Scientists unfinished notes, not the most reliable source of information I would guess. Who knew how the Thing would react when first brought to life, how stable the 'imitations' would be and how it would react when it was confronted or the host was on the verge of dying. After all I seem to remember it acting in a similar manner during the blood test scene in the first film.I think the makers have done a good solid job, and the film on the whole was true to the original.",The Thing

I would have liked to see more character development, but I still enjoyed it. The prequel's attention to all the little details that we see in John Carpenter's THE THING was really amazing. The producers obviously went to great lengths to reproduce those. However, the only real complaint I have about the prequel is that one very BIG detail was changed. In John Carpenter's movie we see MacReady watching film that was taken by the Norwegian team as they used explosives to uncover the alien ship. In the prequel, the ship is uncovered when one of the things goes into it and starts powering up the engines in order to take off and melts the ice away. Other than that, I completely enjoyed watching this movie. And the tie-in at the end of the prequel leading into the opening scenes of John Carpenter's movie were spot on.",The Thing
549,jdaviseb19,"Adequate, not special",5,31 January 2012,"I'll break it down into a few simple concepts of why this movie is just a normal, nothing special movie.The Thing (original movie) was better, and I don't mean in the way where every original is ""usually"" better, but I mean this movie is suck compared to the original.Supposed to be a prequel? except there are quite a few unanswered plot holes not adding up with the original The Thing.I hate when majority of the characters are portrayed as idiots with no common sense, and have no logical actions whatsoever.CGI instead of decent effects. Most of the movie is animated in some form. The CGI is not very impressive in most cases during the movie, especially for a movie whose predecessor's effects were way better, and realistic.Bottom-line is this is just a normal, not special movie. Don't expect to be engaged and don't really expect to be surprised, as the movie is just about what you'd expect it to be. I wasn't too thrilled in how they portrayed the original alien.Also for whatever reason I feel this rendition/prequel really throws you into the base of the horror too fast and too rapidly, and then speeds up to a constant progression. I understand it is of a new era and made from this day and age of style in ""horror"" movies, if you can call them that anymore, but it really lacks in being engaging.",The Thing
550,alyssawend,Awesome,10,3 February 2012,i saw the original movie when i was six and with my dad. the first one is amazing with the special effects but this one improved upon the first every single detail in this movie is made so that it lines up with the first. of course this one is much scarier due to the fact that most movies that were rated R back then were not that scary. the movie is a little inappropriate but has and amazing plot.they made it so very realistic. in the first part when they were making the blood test i thought they were going to copy the original but the it quickly veered of that track. the acting was amazing and it is one of my favorite movies. If you take young children just know that it has frightening scenes and some explicit language.the movie basically starts out in Antarctica where they stumble upon an alien and spaceship frozen in the ice. when they carve it out and take it to the lab there in for a surprise.they soon must figure out who is who in a small test it isn't specific but its a start.luckily they have flame throwersthis is my favorite movie and if you don't see this movie you are crazy. even for people who don't really like scifi you will love it,The Thing
551,kntwhlss,"Great film, definitely pays homage to JC's classic",9,6 February 2012,"Being a fan of the 1982 film by John Carpenter, I was excited when I heard that they were making a prequel to the THING. I also had relatively high expectations. The film was great. It definitely deserved to be related to John Carpenter's classic; However the film was not perfect. As far as explaining everything that happened at the Norwegian camp they were spot on. The only problem I had with the film was the pacing. Unlike the '82 version this film was a little rushed. While the film was creepy and of course gory they lacked the atmosphere that the first one had. In the first movie you had a sense of the chills running down your spine, whereas this one kind of lacked that. You didn't feel as though you were there and felt claustrophobic. Other than that the film was great. The thing(no pun intended) that was impressive was even explaining the minor details that you would miss if you don't watch the first movie with detail. All in all I thought movie was really good definitely lived up to the name. I give the film 9/10",The Thing
552,Phatdub,Fair verdict for what it is.,8,6 August 2012,"You don't make a prequel of such highly regarded film (Carpenter's version of course) without the highest degree of respect. Writers and director of that 2011's Thing did just that. That should be said first whether you like the result or not.Then asking myself is the plot as credible as it was in 1982? My answer is without a doubt, yes.Taking in consideration that van Heijningen had the ungrateful chore of working with strict boundaries of an almost entirely solved conclusion and the obligation to merge with somebody else work seemingly, i feel those goals were fulfilled entirely. The creature is once again manoeuvred incredibly well by the special effects guys who truly have it attacking and morphing in the most gory unexpected and sick imaginative ways.Other than the identical title, which got most mistakenly thinking it was a remake. I find it hard to explain the mix reviews it got by some. It sure is to me very close or just as bleeping scary than its predecessor and the cast is good and directed well by an obviously able newcomer. No overacting nor stupid teenagers punch lines and no typical sexual ¨after the act¨ slaughtering.Way above the legendary poor standard of acting/directing from the horror/sci-fi genre, this movie stands its ground beside the ¨Carpenter Thing¨. Does Carpenter himself could have done a better job with this highly risky business. I have my doubts.",The Thing
553,kaserman,Why wasn't it renamed?!,7,29 July 2012,"When I first heard they were remaking The Thing I was at first annoyed, then intrigued, then exited. I'm so glad they didn't revisit the exact John Carpenter plot as it is my favourite movie ever made and couldn't be improved upon in my eyes. A prequel though, yes I could buy that.Skipping any spoilers or blatant worship of John Carpenter's version I am happy to say I'm reasonably impressed. Having watched the Blu-ray version the landscapes are jaw dropping and the sound is as good as I've heard through my system. I congratulate the special effects team and stunt men/women, one of my biggest worries was going to be a CGI 'thing' but other than one gripe at the end I was impressed throughout. Other pluses are the Norwegian cast, a nice touch adding so many.However there were some down-sides... To pick out one good thing from the JC version is tough but for me its the suspense/trust mechanic. This can only be built over time, strong characters, and through very well thought out camera work. The prequel seriously lacked here. It had moments of strength and wasn't poor but felt like it could have been another 30 mins long at least to tell the full story. The lack of Kurt Russell and his beard's brilliant performance meant the lead character seriously suffered, and the general strength of the full cast was not portrayed. At times it was little more than an entertaining slasher and for the annoyance factor for me it was a shame there were Americans involved in the plot at all. Lastly, though again not poor, the camera work fell very short of some of the brilliant shots captured in the JC version.I know that sounds like a punishing review but I still came away from the film feeling impressed and satisfied that they linked the two films very succinctly and at least tried to stay true to the vision of John Carpenter's The Thing. This is a story that has gone from 'Who Goes There?', to 'The Thing From Another World', to 'The Thing', (all very different) but unfortunately that was where they ran out of names. If only they could've given it a different title it would've held its own place rather than treading on the toes of a movie legend.",The Thing
554,eric_palmer,Effects are the only reason to watch,2,8 March 2012,"This was not a good movie. I had a hard time finding any redeeming qualities about this other than a desire to have some continuity with the original (did the writers watch the Norwegian's video seen in the 1982 version? That should have been the basis for the story), some creative monster effects, and the photography.Complaints - None of the characters had any depth. We didn't know anything about them. Why should we care about what was happening to them? In the 1982 version, each person had a distinctive personality and our hero had to overcome his WTF attitude to save everybody.The characters figure everything out way too easily. For a bunch of scientists, they didn't need much evidence to come to their conclusions.There is no suspense about who might not really be themselves. The thing is revealed before it had a chance to hide itself. In the 1982 version, the thing gets to work behind the scenes before it is uncovered.The real threat from the 1982 version was not that it would kill everyone in the camp but that it could spread if it left Antartica. Although this group wants to get rid of the thing, there is no ""hey, this might be real bad if it gets out of here"" kind of discussion. Other than to not die, why do they fight it? You see the thing on camera way too much. Think about why Jaws was so effective.This movie does not stand on its own. I wouldn't have understood or even have watched it if I hadn't been familiar with the 1982 film.Why tell me a story that invoked my imagination (the mystery of what happened with the Norwegians) and give me the details badly? I think a continuation of the 1982 film would have been a better story. What happened when their supplies or the next group came?",The Thing
555,jeanmarc-lucchini,A cheap ruin,4,10 March 2012,"As in some other countries like DK, The Thing hasn't been released here in Austria, without any reason. But I achieved to watch a steaming version on Internet (no choice, I was so excited to watch it), and I should say I'm happy that I didn't pay one cent for that ""thing"".Such a disappointment about the story, ambiance and the effects! Even the blurish picture quality couldn't hide the bad cheap CGs.I will mention only SOME bad points, I don't remember any good points, really!Half of the crew is American. It seems we don't have good palaeontologists or helicopter pilots in Europe. Matthijs van Heijningen explained that they had to do this for the American audience. SighHelicopter scene, split-face merging effects and even the final one are really bad, bottom shelf CG, not better than the ""Snakes on a train"" or other The Asylum productions.No continuity between the design of the '82 creatures and the '2011 ones. Shapes, motion, are so different. We even don't feel that both movies take place in the same period.Nothing about the explosive '82 scene around the space ship. Many ideas taken from the '82 version, and then doesn't contribute to anything. Some people say the 2011 version helps us to understand all the"" why and how"" of the sequel errr, the little explanations don't help.No consistence or emotion of the characters, we don't feel sorry when they die, unlike the '82 version. Some characters are even completely useless for the story.Kate Lloyd is sooooo clever, knows everything and has answers within 2 seconds. As a paleontologist, she fights quite well, uses weapons like an expert. Really multipurpose! On the other side the Norwegians are a bit dumb...The microscope cells observation is so ridiculous with a bubbly liquid-like noise in the background, so cliché! The nasty cells have legs and exactly the same size as a human ones. After a few seconds Kate is categoric, and has the ultimate answer. Wow, clever!Cheap jump scenes, like in '80s teenagers horror movies. We didn't need that.The typical Hollywood disposable-cliché background music. You hear it, you forget it. Far away from the cold and stifling ambiance of the JC '82 version.I watch The Thing '82 more than 10 times a year. I will watch The Thing 2011 less than 1 time every 10 years.",The Thing
556,mortsokcaz,great for the first 3/4!!!,6,1 April 2012,how can i sum up the new thing remake........ well the first three quarters were good up until when actor/stud Eric Christian Olsen perishes because all the other actors are standing around like jack asses. Eric Christian Olsen is the best part of this movie. he seems like the kind of guy who you don't sleep with on the first date cause your too busy starring into the those puppy eyes of his. man i would do whatever he was into just to have him hold me afterwords. aside from a strong emotional attachment i feel towards his character i also feel a strong physical attraction to his hot body. i bet underneath the shirt is just the right amount of chest hair growing out of rock hard six pack abs. i can't believe they would kill him off i demand that they remake this movie again and give him more lines and more shirtless scenes maybe possibly full frontal nudity. but even if there's no nudity i think maybe a 3d remake with his shirt off would do.,The Thing
557,legobrick10,It was well a THING,1,4 May 2012,"This film is a abomination of all the films ever created. I spent the whole film predicting exactly what was going to happen next. Oh no the alien is advancing on the poor defenceless man with the knife what ever will he do, what this a conveniently placed girl with a flame thrower who did not seem to notice this event earlier, how did they even get flamethrowers you don't just keep them lying around a research facility, wait i know why its because there employers totally knew this was going to happen so the prepared for the worst when they didn't know what it was or had any info about it. And the spaceship i mean who has vents into the main corridor, the girl literally falls into the main corridor from falling in the vent, also the alien is gonna have asteroids and space stuff to clean out for weeks. why did the alien not go back to the ship in the first place, instead it just sort of killed everyone first, if the producer use the excuse that the piolot was killed in the crash or the first alien was a mutation of the pilot then why did it go back to the ship? This film sucked no imagination the same as the first one. So in conclusion don't see this film because you get very angry at people going ""it can transform hears a good idea lets split up"" and they all die. I hate this film, lots of love the internet.

558,Lfries,A poor effort,5,25 November 2011,"First off I am a huge fan of John Carpenters - The Thing. Carpenters was remake of Howard Hawks already great film, it surpassed it in many obvious ways - special effects and script etc... But for me it was the tension and atmosphere that Carpenter built up with his music and slow suspenseful build up that truly had it the better film.It's going to be impossible for me to review this new film (same titled prequel) without referring back to carpenters film; and as it a prequel I think that fair.First off the main protagonist in this movie is a woman, played Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She's does a good job with a poor script. I understand why the studio wanted a woman in the lead; more female bums on seats and I guess it worked in Alien. Of course the original had no women in at all; this was a smart move and emphasized the isolation of the men trapped in the cold Antarctic. Joel Edgerton as the male lead also did a fine job but again was hampered by the script.My main issue with this film was it lack of suspense. I was never on the edge of my seat; I could second guess who had been copied. *(Slight Spoiler) There was even a scene near the beginning of the film where the audience is directly told that The Thing is on helicopter, by Winstead character waving her hands frantically - why?* Issues are also raised in the script. Winstead (our protagonist) is a scientist. But we are lead to believe that she's figured out that The Thing is copying creatures far to early. In-fact this is covered in a single scene of her looking into a microscope seeing these some cells are duplicating. It was almost like her character had just watched Carpenter's The Thing on VHS the night before.Let's move onto the special effects. Now I know that SFX don't make a movie but in this kind of movie they really do make up an important part. If you've seen The Thing (82) you will know it has practical special effects (that even today) look great and are amazingly inventive. Shoot forward nearly 30 years and the effects are poor, poorly lit, poorly executed and worst of all boring. I was amazed at the amount of times a body just split in half. In-fact the effects look so much like cgi effects that it actually quite jarring.The story to be honest isn't that important in this short or film, like I said before it's all about atmosphere and suspense, as The Thing (11) neither of these things it's all a bit dull. I love the original movie so really wanted to love this, unfortunately it just not very good. If you have not seen Carpenters -The Thing please see it first, it's in a different league.",The Thing

560,stefbuff,"This is a good movie, honest",7,28 May 2013,"Not sure if anyone is interested in a review two years after the movie has been released... but anyway here is my two cents, in case you are looking for something to rent for a horror evening at home.This is, in my opinion, a good movie, and much smarter than you would expect. It's a prequel, but it's still also a remake: it basically creates a variation over the themes and events of the original. There are many key moments in here that were already in the original: the creature getting free, the let's-find-out-who-is-human moment, and more. But basically, rather than copying exactly the model, these key moments end in ways that are different from the original. There is also a McReady-like character, for example, that at some point has an unexpected twist.So, the general sensation is that you are watching a remake, the paranoia is there, everything is there... but different, so you still wonder what is going to happen. The story flows, there is no significant flaw in the logic of events, in my opinion. There is a lot of attention to detail as well, so everything in the end fits and from a narrative point of view this is a fully working prequel. You could watch this and then the original movie, and it would be OK.Of course, if the original is your favorite movie of all times, you will unavoidably hate this. I have read reviews stating that this movie is ""insulting"" because it uses CG, or because there is a girl... things that really make sense only if you are a hardcore, unreasonable fan of the original that has decided that this movie MUST suck just because it's the remake (or prequel) of a classic.I think this movie is very respectful of its source material, it manages to recreate the right atmosphere, and there is no Midi-chlorian in it - meaning there is no awkward revelation that in its weirdness/unbelievability spoils the fictional universe.Of course, it's not perfect. My main objection is that the quality of the CG could have been better: as it is, the moments in which the creature shows itself in its unspeakable monstrosity are not as effective as they could be. Also, you could argue that it's a movie that doesn't add much of its own to the myth of the Thing.But overall, way better than the average remake/prequel/sequel of a classic horror movie we see nowadays. Waaaay better than Prometheus, for example.",The Thing
561,iansonuk,Not bad at all.,9,1 December 2012,"The average rating for this film isn't especially high, so there must be a lot of people giving it bad reviews. I don't see why. As a prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 film it works pretty well in terms of plot. Unlike so many action/horror films the cast do not for the most part do anything unbelievably stupid. Furthermore sufficient of the cast are likable enough for the viewer to be at least a bit interested in their fates. The whole 'which one's the monster' paranoia bit is carried off very well in John Carpenter's film, and there has clearly been an attempt here to imitate that- a fairly successful attempt in my view. There are echoes of the plots of the 1982 film, as well as it's 1951 predecessor, but this is achieved without mindlessly ripping off any plot details. The special effects are reliant on CGI (not an option in 1982), but that CGI is pretty well done. I don't see what more one can ask from a film of this type.",The Thing

The monster feels reasonably organic and scary and the atmosphere is just right. The biggest problem with this version is that there is not quite enough suspense and silence and that, as is typical of 2000's and 2010's movies, it is a little too eager to cut to action scenes instead of dragging out the terror and suspense of not knowing where or inside who the monster lurks. It can never quite match the slow, grim roller coaster ride of terror, disgust and brief, unbelieving comic relief of the 1980's version. But it makes a good effort.Does it bring anything new to the table in terms of story? No, but neither did The Thing (1982). Let's face it: monster movies are all alike when it comes to the basic story. The monster lurks, the monster attacks and the monster's properties are gradually revealed. It is not the story itself that makes a good monster movie, it is how the story is told and presented.After watching it all the way to the end and past the credit roll I realize that this movie was made by fans like me. All things considered this is a good monster flick to watch as an introduction before you watch The Thing (1982). Sacrilege avoided.",The Thing
564,jenp3493,Hollywood ruins yet another classic film,3,21 January 2014,"Before I started to watch this movie, I was fully aware that this was a ""prequel"" to the 1982 John Carpenter's The Thing. I wasn't planning on seeing the animatronics and other cool non-computerized special effects like the ones that were in the 1982 film. Let me tell you the CGI in this movie was absolutely horrid. It's like it was half-assed and I was really not impressed with it or what ""the thing"" even looked like. The story line wasn't too great either and the acting was sub-pare. I really wanted to like this movie because The Thing and The Thing From Another World (1951) (in which the 1982 movie was based off of), but this movie failed to impress me. I am glad I waited for this movie to come on TV and not waste money either seeing it in theaters or paying to rent it.

Well after viewing it, man I was blown away. Learning what happened at the Norwegian Camp was cool to see. Mary Elizabeth WInstead as the lead heroine added extra spice and charisma to the screen. She is such a great actress, and she is not too bad to look at. The film had a lot of well casted supporting characters. For instance Joel Edgerton was great as the chopper pilot Carter, kind of reminds of Macready from the original. The actor who played Jameson was a great touch, the actor is very underrated and when his presence was on screen, he stole the show, even though he had few lines. This is not a remake, and I hope the original never does get remade. Seeing a fresh take as a prequel was a nice touch.

This movie contradicts or screws up everything we knew of this timeframe (what took place at the Norwegian camp) from the original movie. Yes, some bodies and objects end up in the same place we saw them in 1982, but other MAJOR events are completely altered.

567,johnzapetis,"Prequel answers questions, creates additional and leaves me hungry for more!",8,16 July 2014,"I've seen The Thing (2011) three times now and still have a difficult time distinguishing all the characters. I am still not able to tell you who's who for the entire cast nor what their job functions were at the antarctic base as you could somewhat in the first film. That aside, I was happy to see that a prequel story of a beloved film was being told and stayed true to many elements of the original. Many have disliked this film for its use of CGI and not using practical effects exclusively. If you're going to do that, you may as well have filmed it with antique cameras as well to blur the fact that it's a puppet. Geez! I loved the modern effects and the special features explain how they merged the practical with the impractical effects to create living monsters. The cast was superb in this rendition, no one was over-acting as they do in many of today's horror films. This story did have some loopholes and unanswered questions as did the first film. If the creature is a collection of captured DNA, they never touched upon its imitating plant-life. John Carpenters film had a flowering tentacle coming out of the dog thing. There was a hint of a dinosaur thing that emerged out of the Blair thing at the end of the Carpenter film. I always imagined that was it's true form. This film made it look like a sliver from Magic The Gathering that was trapped in the ice. I loved that. Maybe they'll make another story around the rescue teams or the Russian arctic camp. And what would the McMordo set look like? Leaves me with an appetite for more, how about you?",The Thing
568,shawn-dulmage-58-413341,Some back story info on the story,7,6 November 2016,"For those who are not aware, check out The Thing from Another World from 1951. This is the first movie adaptation that I am aware of. Both of the later movies in my opinion are good movies. Who Goes There? is a science fiction novella by John W. Campbell, Jr., written under the pen name Don A. Stuart. It was first published in the August 1938. The novella has been adapted four times as a motion picture: the first in 1951 as The Thing from Another World; the second in 1972 as Horror Express; the third in 1982 as The Thing directed by John Carpenter;[1] and most recently as a prequel to the Carpenter version, also titled The Thing, released in 2011.",The Thing
569,Lyds-154-64113,A Great Prequel,9,22 December 2016,"When I went to see this movie, I knew full well that it was a prequel. As such, I did not compare it for 1 second with John Carpenters updated, special effects version of the original ""The Thing From Another World"".Instead, I viewed it for what it was. Namely, the answer to the question of ""What Happened"" and why were they shooting at the dog.Any other interpretation is simply making presumptions about what YOU thought it would be.Those that are old enough can recall the sheer horror of the character created by James Arness in that remote Arctic outpost as the characters are hunted for their blood and breeding purposes.John Carpenters work was great but it simply didn't have the magnitude of horror that the original movie had and comparing this prequel with Carpenters version just does the viewer an injustice.Simply put, everything came together quite well in the ending 5 minutes which quickly defined this as a prequel.",The Thing

572,lucasrduncan,"Excellent Prequel, on par with first film",10,22 June 2016,"First of all, the reviews for this film are very negative for the quality produced. The film gave us a clear understanding of what lead up to the events in the original film, starring Kurt Russell. The film offers great visual appeal and extended action clips. The film also offers a sophisticated and well-produced story that is solid all the way up to the end. The film also follows similar events that reflect back to the prequel in the original film. The thrills and scares in this movie are excellent and well executed. The end is by far what connects the original film and the prequel. I would highly recommend this film.",The Thing
573,dclmail,original is best. b&w. so what!!!,10,19 January 2019,The original is the best with much more suspense. You don't know what the creature is for half the movie. The characters are well developed. The dialogue is faced paced.,The Thing
574,edwinpavitt,Missed Opportunity,4,12 January 2018,"I wouldn't recommend this film either as a stand-alone or prequel. Apart from some scenery at the beginning it is so poor. I watched the 1982 version a couple of days before and read Who Goes There (in one sitting it was so good) on the very day I viewed this so called prequel. I was so disappointed with this film; the makers could have done so much better. It was unbelievably clichéd. The final ""terror"" scenes and destruction of The Thing were so lame and predictable they were immensely annoying. There wasn't anything new, simply a rehash of moments seen before in a number of much greater films from this genre. The film wasn't even tense at the times when it was supposed to be. I was also going to say how awfully wooden Mary Elizabeth Winstead was in the lead role until I discovered she played the part of Nikki Swango in Fargo (S3), which I thought she played brilliantly. I suggest the next time anyone makes a prequel to The Thing they read the book first and hopefully will be inspired to make it more about people or ""people"" than silly monsters. Honestly this is a bad B movie.",The Thing

576,ClintReno,Oh dear.,1,7 February 2012,"This film is dreadful.OK ignore the Howard Hawks' 1951 film and compare this to John Carpenter's 1982 version of The Thing. Thirty years of technological advances and all that time to think of a decent story and they come up with this? How? I stuck with it just to see if it was going somewhere, but no, it is just a poor remake, it's meant to be a prequel but it just rehashes Carpenters film without adding anything new. The budget was an estimated $35 million, I think the dog was paid 34 mil and they spent the other million on the helicopter.If you've not seen either yet, and you have to watch this... if someone has a gun to your head, watch this one first, it's only redeeming feature is you can watch it before watching the ""sequel"" and you'll appreciate just how good John Carpenter's 1982 film was... or still is.Do yourselves a favour and avoid. I'd rather watch paint dry than have to sit through this again.",The Thing
577,konjad,Horrible action flick with stupid characters,1,16 August 2018,"This movie is not only a horrible addition to the original The Thing that contradicts a lot of events in the original (especially the alien life form), but is bland and boring on its own too.First of all, although one of the main characters repeats ""science"" often like a mantra, this movie is as anti-scientific as it gets. Sure, Carpenter's The Thing took some things rather lightly, but it did never cross the line of believability. The alien life form acted according to laws of physics and its biology was believable for a science fiction film, the only issue with it could perhaps only be how quick it was to infect. But here? Here we have ALIENS JUMPING OUT OF ICE FOR AWESOME SURPRISE, and other action that is as dumb as it sounds. But that's not the worst, oh no, there are even worse things.Characters. This is what makes me so dumbfounded when watching this film. The action takes place on an Antarctica with a group of scientists. Just like in the original. However, unlike the original where characters were clearly mature professionals, here everybody acts like a silly edgy teenager with EMOTIONS just bursting out of them for no apparent reason or their actions are irrational. They can't seem to come to any logical decisions, save for the main character the girl (I guess they didn't know how to make her intelligent, so just made everyone else retarded), which isn't that rational either, and definitely overly emotional. I felt like watching a copy-paste ""horror"" movie with teenagers in an abandoned house in the woods, not a horror about professional team encountering a virus/monster. I have to say I have never seen a horror movie as stupid as this one. At least many other silly horror movies, which are not aiming high, are not deceiving the viewer about their theme and intent like this one does.I can't recommend it to anyone at all. I can only recommend the Carpenter's version, which is great and you should watch it if you haven't. as for 2011 one, avoid like the plague.",The Thing

579,sweetooth0,Modern studio horror has turned to crap,2,15 October 2011,"I sincerely believe that if it had been handled properly this movie could have stood proudly alongside the Carpenter version.If the filmmakers had balls the entire movie would have been in Norwegian with subtitles. It made zero sense that they would need to bring in people from American and Britain. Are there no radio operators or palaeontologists in Norway? Characters completely contradict this later in the movie when they are desperate to ensure no outsiders come to the base to steal their discovery. Stupid.I guarantee the English speaking characters were included because the filmmakers think the audience is stupid and can't handle reading in a movie. And of course the Americans are the heroes and the Norwegians are nothing but walking meat bags waiting to get ripped apart and eaten. The casting of women really didn't bother me too much as any sort of tacked on romantic sub-plot was completely absent. At least they got that right. But with no romance and no gender conflict, did they need to be women? Or was this just a studio decision to appeal to a wider demographic?The rampant use of sub-par CG destroys this movie. This should have been a showcase for every advancement made in practical effects since 1982. They had some real talent working on it (Alec Guinness and Tom Woodruff Jr.) but all they got to do was sculpt a few dead aliens on lab tables. Everything else, including a majority of the gore, was rendered with cheap looking computer animation. This movie should have been mind blowing. Instead I was pulled right out of it by how terribly unconvincing the creatures looked every time they were on screen, which is a lot. Why didn't they get Rob Bottin back? Even as a consultant it couldn't have hurt. The CG should have complemented the practical work (see Pan's Labyrinth or Alexander Aja's Hills Have Eyes for how to do this right), instead it totally replaces it.What adds insult to injury is that throughout production the filmmakers kept saying how they were going to do as much as possible using practical effects. I guess that just makes them liars. What a waste.The creatures don't even sound right. The original monsters sounded unique with their haunting, almost sorrowful howling. Here they just make everything sound like Aliens, except way too loud, to the point where it actually becomes painful as your bombarded with high pitched shrieks constantly.Another thing that bugged me: glaring continuity errors. This is a prequel to a movie that's been watched repeatedly for 20+ years, the importance of continuity is paramount. In the original the American team watches tapes of the Norwegians where they clearly blow the alien craft out of the ice with explosives. The characters even say ""they're using Thermite charges"" and it shows the explosion on the video. In this, the ice above the ship breaks when the creature turns on its ship. I read in an interview that the director always had a copy of the '82 version on hand to check for continuity. How do you miss that? When the ship is shown in the original it is in a vast snow plane. Where did the vehicles and cave from this movie go? The stories are seemingly hours apart, so I don't think they got covered up in a storm. Sloppy film making.It states at the start it's 1982. We see Kate Lloyd examining the inside of a specimen using a camera on a tube. Next to her is a flat-screen computer monitor with a display showing modern looking video, text and graphics. Funny, I don't recall that technology existing in 1982. Take a look at the computer simulation used in the original: 2-bit graphics with non-existent animation. You were lucky back then if you had a computer that could render more than green and black on the screen. How hard would it have been to secure a CRT TV from a pawn shop and hook up the video feed using RCA cables from a camcorder? Because I have a feeling that is exactly what they would have been using.The 1982 version has one of the most memorable soundtracks in movie history. The music totally adds to the bleakness and horror. Here, it's your standard throwaway Hollywood score that you'll forget the minute you leave the cinema. The classic theme is heard at the end, and by then it's too little too late. Finally, the 2011 movie thinks that having random characters transform into monsters at unexpected times without any sort of logic, simply to have an onslaught of cheap jump scares, is suspenseful. You never see 95% of them come into any contact with the creatures. I get that they were trying to keep you on your toes, but the mystery should have been better developed like it was in the original. The creature in the original wanted to stay hidden as much as possible, in this they transform into monsters wantonly. Instead of suspense and paranoia, you just have a monster chase movie, with monsters that don't hold up.The writer was the same guy who worked on the abysmal Nightmare on Elm Street remake. The constant monsters popping out closely mirrors the tactic he used in NOES with micro naps so Freddy could pop out and essentially say ""boo!"" constantly. Your 0 for 2 buddy.The only reasons I rated this movie a 2 and not a 1 is that story-wise it wasn't too offending and did manage to tie in well with the original (continuity errors aside), the acting was fine (although there's basically zero character development), and despite how fake the CG looked, the creature designs were cool (just so poorly executed).",The Thing
580,kugelbart,bad,3,8 November 2018,"I grew up seeing the carpenter version when it first came out. I will never forget the scene where the staff had to cut their fingers for the blood test.This remake sucks in every way.
It´s too long, boring, the CGI effects are shockingly bad.
Also there is an overload of (CGI) blood the original didn´t have.Too bad the carpenter version is old so the young generation can´t see the impact this film had at the time.
Everybody was shocked when leaving the cinema knowing that the remaining crew members were about to die when the fire stops warming them.",The Thing
581,manningkent-1,to many things just didn't make sense,4,26 July 2014,"Unlike most of these reviews I couldn't care less about it being a prequel to John Carpenters ""The Thing"" which I liked but wasn't an avid fan of the movie. With this movie the monster which in reality is a highly intelligent being that flies a space ship. Yet this highly intelligent being abandoned his spacecraft knowing he will make it a couple of hundred yards before he turns into a Popsicle! Some of you will say the craft was dead so he was no worse off. How is it then he goes back to the spaceship, starts it right up and plans to fly away. Another instance of the alien brain deadness is when the group as a whole (except Kate) decides to take the snow cats to another base. This is supposedly exactly what the alien or aliens wants at this point wants. They are leaving, no one gives a rats ass what Kate thinks, all the alien has to do is go along with the crowd to get exactly what it wants. You know what the alien does next which is exactly what he wouldn't do! When they are separating the people up and the obnoxious professor says his crowns are porcelain,their inorganic too so all he had to do was point one out and have them pull it off and bingo he is one of the good guys which he was at that point. There are many more ludicrous points which I won't bring up but although I love science fiction I don't like science fiction filled with stupidity.",The Thing
582,boggit67,If you have seen the Carpenter remake...Avoid this prequel!!!!,3,24 November 2011,"If you have been fortunate enough to have enjoyed the John Carpenter version of 'The Thing' from 1982, avoid this film! Even as a 'prequel', it relies VERY heavily on the 1982 version, with some scenes, apart from the dialogue, being direct copies.The CGI alien effects have nothing like the impact of Rob Bottins' animatronic/latex effects of '82. The story does in no way give you the same feeling of claustrophobia or being trapped with no chance of escape from the unknown creature. Do yourself a favour and rent or buy the original.It is a far more satisfying experience....",The Thing
