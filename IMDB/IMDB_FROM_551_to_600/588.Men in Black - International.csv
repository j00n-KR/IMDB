0,Leofwine_draca,Skip it,4,7 October 2020,"My history of the MEN IN BLACK franchise is rather chequered. I didn't care much for the first film and actively hated the second; the third one, complete with its time travelling plotline, was actually my favourite of the trilogy. I had no great hopes for INTERNATIONAL, the fourth instalment carrying on the universe but without the cast, and I was right. This is a perfunctory CGI adventure which boasts a typically charming and funny performance from Chris Hemsworth and nothing else at all. Tessa Thompson tries hard but fails in an underwritten role, while others like Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson are just there to pick up the pay cheque. The CGI effects seem worse than they did in the earlier films, and the whole plot is tired and predictable. Skip it!",Men in Black - International
1,SnoopyStyle,European Vacation,6,24 July 2019,"In New York, Molly Wright (Tessa Thompson) is obsessed with extraterrestrial aliens since twenty years earlier when she helped one as a child and witnessed Men in Black neuralysing her parents. She infiltrates MIB headquarters and Agent O (Emma Thompson) reluctantly assigns her as a probational agent. She is sent to the London office which is run by Agent High T (Liam Neeson). Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) is a local legend after he and High T stopped the Hive three years earlier.When a franchise grows tired, it often takes off on a trip to an exotic location. This has that vibe although there are some differences. The biggest is that Will Smith is no longer with the franchise. I am more and more convinced that he is a corner stone and taking him away risks toppling the whole thing. I don't hate anything in this movie. I like Tessa and I like Chris. I like Tessa's story. I like almost everything but it's missing something. It's missing its beating heart. Every moment in this movie has a hollowness like a piece of the screen is simply blank. The other issue is that it doesn't expand the franchise other than going to a fake Europe. It's a rehashing with new people.",Men in Black - International
2,Prismark10,Men in Black: International,2,11 October 2019,"You know a film is in trouble when two of the main stars turned up on the film set bringing their own writers to fix issues with the script.The original Men in Black managed to deliver an exciting film in 90 minutes.30 minutes into this film I was wondering where was the plot?The film starts with young Molly Wright in New York who encountered an alien and saw her parents being neulayzed by the MIB. The adult Molly (Tessa Thompson) has spent years trying to join the MIB and succeeds after she infiltrates its headquarters.Agent O (Emma Thompson) assigns her as a probationary agent to the London office which is run by Agent High T (Liam Neeson.) Molly teams up with Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) to babysit Vungus the Ugly who is alien royalty. He is killed by alien twins.Agent H is arrogant and a bit of a slacker on the job and Agent High T always covers up for him. However it turns out that someone within MIB might be a traitor.The Men in Black films run out of steam with the sequel in 2002. This one does not even get out of the starting blocks. To call it a tired retread is an insult to a tired retread.The best thing about Men in Black: International was an anecdote from Ed Solomon who wrote the first movie. He was in a profit share for Men in Black which grossed over $500 million worldwide.Each year he recieves a letter from Columbia Pictures informing him that as Men in Black has not yet made a profit, there is no money for him to receive. Solomon said in advance of the release of the third sequel, this is proof that Columbia Pictures are in it for the art and not money. I think he was being ironic.",Men in Black - International
3,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining and Funny,6,27 August 2019,"The franchise ""Men in Black: International"" is an entertaining and funny adventure. MIB films with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are certainly superior but this new movie is worthwhile watching. Chris Hemsworth performing Agent H and Tessa Thompson in the role of the rookie Agent M show good chemistry and are responsible for some hilarious moments while Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson give the necessary credibility to the agency. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""MIB: Homens de Preto - Internacional"" (""MIB: Men in Black: International"")",Men in Black - International
4,nogodnomasters,Queen's pawn takes King,8,23 June 2019,"This appears to be a continuation of the series and not a reboot. Frank, the pug is in this one as what appears to be the lone returning player. As a child Molly (Tessa Thompson) had experience with the MIB and wasn't neutralized. She grew up seeking to join the MIB until she found them. Impressed with her efforts, Emma Thompson makes her an agent. As agent M she goes to London and work for agent High T (Liam Neeson) and with agent H (Chris Hemsworth). She chose him. She has that Harry Potter type reputation as being the only one ever to find MIB and they expect great things from her. And then they save the world.Didn't have the Smith and Jones chemistry and banter, but the couple worked together in an acceptable manner and the dialogue picked up once ""Pawny"" came into the film. The alien club scene would have been better if they had played the cantina music from 'Star Wars."" Alien characters lacked the appeal of previous features.",Men in Black - International
5,kosmasp,The Men in Black franchise,7,1 August 2019,"So two of the main Thor characters star in this and you can tell they have chemistry together. You should also be able to tell that this is a light affair. A movie that does not aim for excellence, but just is there to entertain you. Chris Hemsworth does, what Chris Hemsworth - well is known for. Being the funny and flirty guy who's good looking.If you lower your expectations (if you even had any) and don't expect this to be anything else than it actually is, you'll have fun. There is a weird cameo of a German soccer/football star in it - not sure if they have different cameos in different countries, but I wonder if other viewers will be stunned or irritated if not. Whatever the case, the movie is light and fun and you should treat it as such",Men in Black - International
6,jboothmillard,Men in Black: International,4,23 June 2019,"The first Men in Black is fantastic, the second one is disappointing, and the third is reasonably good, it is most likely this fourth movie was made to refresh the franchise, and make some money, I knew it had mixed to negative reviews, but I was always going to see it, directed by F. Gary Gray (The Negotiator, Law Abiding Citizen, Straight Outta Compton, Fast & Furious 8). Basically in Brooklyn 1996, young Molly Wright (Mandeiya Flory) has an alien in her bedroom, she helps it to escape, she also witnesses her parents being neuralysed by agents of Men in Black (MIB). Twenty-three years later, with her applications for the FBI and the CIA having been rejected, for her ""delusions"" regarding the evidence of alien life, Molly (Tessa Thompson) wants to track down the Men in Black. She manages to track down an alien landing and, dressed in black herself, finds and sneaks into MIB headquarters in New York. She is caught entering the agency, but Molly makes an impression on the head, Agent O (Emma Thompson), arguing she has the skills, having found out about the agency's existence and having no life outside, making her an ideal candidate. Molly convinces Agent O to award her probationary agent status as ""Agent M"" and assigned to the London branch of the organisation. In London, M head of the London branch High T (Liam Neeson), and manages to arrange for herself to be assigned to assist Agent H (Chris Hemsworth). M and H meet with alien royal family member Vungus the Ugly (Kayvan Novak), also a close friend of H, but he is fatally injured by mysterious alien twins who can manifest as pure energy. Vungus passes a strange crystal on to M before he dies, claiming that he cannot trust H, saying he has changed since they last met. Agent C (Rafe Spall) is disappointed with H's dealing of the situation, but M points out that few knew Vungus' location when he was attacked, leading to the conclusion that there is a traitor in MIB. High T assigns C and M to investigate, while H is demoted to desk duty. DNA traces the mysterious twins to the Hive, a parasitic race who invade other planets by merging with the DNA of the conquered species. M learns that H and High T fought off the Hive invasion at the Eiffel Tower in 2016, since then H has developed an uncaring attitude towards his duties and Hight T has helped him to keep his job due to the soft spot they have for each other. H convinces M to join him in following up a lead in Marrakesh, where they recover ""Pawny"" (Kumail Nanjiani), a talking chess piece, the last survivor of a small group of aliens who were attacked by the Twins, he pledges new loyalty to M. But they are subsequently trapped by MIB agents, as video evidence has been recovered of Vungus passing the crystal to M, they suspect she is the traitor. H, M and Pawny manage to escape on rocket-powered bikes, and they learn that the crystal Vungus gave M is a powerful weapon. After crashing the bikes, H's alien contact manages to steal the weapon and take it to Riza Stavros (Rebecca Ferguson), an alien arms merchant and H's ex-girlfriend. H, M and Pawny travel to Riza's island fortress, and try to infiltrate the base to recover the weapon but are caught by Riza and her bodyguard. However, the bodyguard turns out to be the alien that M rescued as a child, he allows them to leave while he keeps Riza contained. The three are cornered by the Twins once again, but the twins are killed by High T and a group of agents. Although the case appears to be concluded, H and M review the evidence, it turns out the Twins required the weapon to use against the Hive rather than to use it for the Hive, and the only evidence of Hive DNA was provided by High T. Agent C concedes that the evidence suggests that High T has been deceptive, he allows H and M to follow High T to the Eiffel Tower. They travel to an extra-terrestrial wormhole and confront Hight T, and it revealed that H was neuralysed to erase the memory of the activities of the Hive, and High T is one of them. The High T/Hive hybrid activates the wormhole to draw the Hive to Earth, but H is able to draw out High T's true personality long enough for M to use the weapon to destroy High T and eradicate the Hive infestation. With the truth of High T's conversion exposed, Agent O joins H and M in Paris, she grants M full MIB agent status and appoints H as the probationary head of the London branch. Also starring Laurent and Larry Bourgeois as the Alien Twins, Kayvan Novak as Nasr / Bassam, Spencer Wilding as Luca Brasi, Marcy Harriell as Molly's Mom, Inny Clemons as Molly's Dad, and Tim Blaney as Frank the Pug. Hemsworth knowingly mocks his own sex appeal, Thompson does well as the young and plucky newbie agent, they are best known as Thor and Valkyrie together in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so they remain a good duo, and Emma Thompson and Neeson are fine. The special effects are certainly fantastic, the first twenty minutes of the young female character being initiated is interested, and there are some reasonable chase and fight sequences, but the story is flat and full of predictability, and it has hardly any wit and humour, only a joke about Piers Morgan an alien makes you titter, a disappointing very average science-fiction action comedy. Okay!",Men in Black - International
7,paul_haakonsen,Quite enjoyable...,6,15 June 2019,"So this was a reboot? It really didn't feel like a reboot, especially since there was a painting of Agents Kay and Jay hanging on the wall...Nevertheless, this 2019 addition to the ""Men In Black"" franchise was actually a nice surprise, especially since I didn't really have much of any high expectations to the movie given the fact it had Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson on the cast list. Glad that I was convinced to go to the cinema with the family to watch it, because it turned out that ""Men In Black: International"" was actually rather enjoyable.Now, the storyline is pretty straight forward, much akin to what it was in the previous three movies. The Earth is under an intergalactic threat of grand proportions and it is up to a few good men - and women - to stop the extraterrestrial threat and save the Earth. Yeah, it's been seen and done before.Akin to the previous movies in the franchise, ""Men In Black: International"" is laced with comedy and lots of great special effects. It is, in fact, what characterizes the movies, isn't it?And I will say that both Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth actually managed to portray Agents M and H respectively quite well and actually were nicely cast for the movie. And the movie also benefited from having the likes of Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson on the cast list as well.The special effects in ""Men In Black: International"" were phenomenal, not that there was any doubt that they wouldn't be, given the premise of the previous three movies. Lots of great ideas and good alien concepts. And, like the previous movies, pay close attention to the backgrounds of the movie as well, because there is so much happening and so many nice touches and creatures to be seen.I was genuinely entertained and amused throughout the course of ""Men In Black: International"" and if you enjoyed the previous movies in the franchise, then you definitely also should go to watch this one.",Men in Black - International
8,studioAT,A funny mess of a film,4,29 October 2019,"In our age of reboots and reimagining's it was only a matter of time before the 'Men in Black' franchise returned. And it returns with mixed results.The major plus of this film is the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, which manages to carry the films overlong length and weaker moments.Sadly though they are lumbered with a overcomplicated plot, and a script that feels too quippy for its own good. Apparently there were issues in the making of this film, and it does show.If you can get over the fact that Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones don't return, and that this is a whole new version of MiB you should be fine, but there was a sort of charm about the original films that makes this look weaker in comparison.",Men in Black - International

11,CinemaSerf,Men in Black sacks....,5,27 November 2019,"Good idea - let's refreshen the cast, relocate to jolly-old England and hopefully we can re-ignite this tiring format. Well, wrong! All of that might have worked if the special effects and alien creepy-crawlies were supported by a decent STORY. Alas, not to be. This bumbles along entirely supported by Chris Hemsworth - and there are limits to even his charismatic skills.

12,oscaralbert,"Back in the 1900s there was a store called ""K-Mart"" . . .",6,23 June 2019,". . . which featured ""Blue Light Specials."" It's somewhat shocking in this Modern Age to find a ""blue light special"" at the center of MEN IN BLACK: INTERNATIONAL. K-Mart went belly-up because its blue light offers were not so special, but at least that general retailer was far more plausible than MIBI. This flick displays a ""highly-compressed blue giant star"" about the size of a rotten cantaloupe at the center of a plastic super-soaker spray gun which any Size 1 dame can easily wave around with one arm. Since compression does NOT change gross weight (or mass), this magical weapon's virtually incalculable tonnage would actually contract our solar system into a lifeless ball of fire in less than a nanosecond! Not only have the writers of MIBI flunked the Physics 101 Mid-term, circa 1850, but they'll also lose their shirts in plagiarism law suits IF anyone connected to the STAR TREK franchise gives this lame outing a glance. ""The Hive"" is the only other salient aspect of MIBI beyond its moldy muskmelon, and that entity is indistinguishable from a Trekkie's ""Borg.""",Men in Black - International
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Well-travelled, yet doesn't go very far",7,16 June 2019,"What starts out looking like standard fare turns out to be a potential threat. Who can solve the mystery? Well, here's who'll have to: Agents H( Hemsworth, who used to be capable, now he's let himself go) and M(Tessa Thompson, who spent 20 years looking for proof, and is on a probationary period, determined to prove herself).The two Leads have a buddy cop/romantic comedy vibe, and excellent chemistry. Pawny(Nanjiani, devoted to her, despising him, and very happy to express both, as a literal living chess piece who has lost his queen, and thus very briefly his purpose, until he accepts her as the new one to serve) is a real standout, consistently hilarious, particularly when they all find themselves having to repair a vehicle. All three improvise lines really well, as do others, such as Spall(a consummate professional who occasionally gets remarkably petty). The script has some interesting ideas. This does not feel like it's just trying to do the first movie over again, like the second one. It's about as good as the third one, and is definitely not on the level of the original. The direction is very capable, albeit workmanlike.Unfortunately, that is all the good that there is to say. About half of the comedy just is not funny. A lot about this is incredibly bland, including the villains. It feels like a bunch of executives determined every aspect of this based on what audiences have responded to in other films. There is passion in parts of this and pay-cheque-cashing in others. Riza(Ferguson, who I'm not certain if she is a great if unconventional choice who has fun hamming it up as an alien, or is terribly miscast and, poor dear, flailing due to her inexperience with this sort of role. She definitely gives it a shot, throwing herself into it) is a mild letdown after a lot of build-up.I recommend this to those who very badly want another entry in this franchise. Personally, if they make more, I'll keep watching, but if this is the last they make, at least for a long time, it's not going to give me sleepless nights. 7/10",Men in Black - International
14,view_and_review,Not the Same Without Will Smith,6,30 June 2019,"MIB is back for a fourth turn and now they are international. No longer in America or just the streets of New York, these niftily dressed good guys travel all over the globe. This MIB gave a go at showing how expansive the MIB network is and how elaborate their operation is.Agents H and M (Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson) have to find out the reason behind the death of a VIA (very important alien). The fate of the world could be at stake.For me, the movie boiled down to one thing: no Will Smith. Tessa and Chris together don't equal one Will Smith. The Smith/Jones tandem was great. You had Smith as the young, slightly animated comic relief and Jones as the elder straight man. Hemsworth and Thompson didn't have the same appeal. At times, it seemed like they were trying too hard to be what Will Smith was naturally. The story was cool, the special effects of course were nice, I just wasn't feeling the main characters.To be fair, many sequels struggle even with the same characters. And the sequels with different main characters are almost assured failures. So, I guess, all things considered... this wasn't bad.",Men in Black - International
15,ferguson-6,spin-off spins out,5,13 June 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is the era of sequels and spin-offs, and every studio dreams of franchises they can squeeze for profit again and again. The 4th entry in the MIB franchise {MEN IN BLACK (1997), MEN IN BLACK II (2002), MEN IN BLACK 3 (2012)}, is certainly more spinoff than sequel, although there is a nugget that ties it to the earlier versions. While we get a new cast and a new director, there are plenty of familiar elements to satisfy loyal fans, although winning new ones may be less likely.Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson are reunited from THOR: RAGNAROK and AVENGERS: ENDGAME to take the leads as Agent H and Agent M, respectively. Replacing the chemistry of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is a pretty tough challenge, even for two likeable and talented actors. Because of that, it probably makes sense that director F. Gary Gray (STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, 2015) and co-writers Matt Holloway and Art Marcum (also co-writers on the original IRON MAN, 2008) take the film in a slightly different direction. There are two key story lines: discovering the ""mole"" within MIB, and protecting the world's most dangerous weapon from falling into the wrong hands.Hemsworth overplays his dashing, somewhat inept super agent (a cross between Bond and Clouseau) who charms his way out of every situation, and even though he doesn't fit the MIB we are accustomed to, he's fun to watch and good for some laughs. Ms. Thompson (so good in CREED) is the brainy rookie who spends two decades trying to maneuver herself into a position at MIB, and once she does, it's clear she belongs. Back from the third film is Emma Thompson as Agent O, a senior MIB manager who interviews and hires Molly. Rafe Spall is Agent C, Agent H's internal adversary, and Liam Neeson is High T, the bureau chief. Rebecca Ferguson appears as Riza, Agent H's handsy former squeeze turned villain in a cool fortress. Dancing twins Laurent and Larry Bourgeois play two shape-shifters (a description that doesn't do justice to their skills).The story bounces from Paris to Brooklyn to London to Marrakesh to Paris to Naples. It's a pretty wild adventure with the snazzy guns and futuristic vehicles we've come to expect. In fact, the Lexus reps the brand quite nicely. Molly's backstory is provided early on as the kind of kid who reads Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" in bed, and the film offers some clever touches with office artwork and the early years of MIB (Gustave Eiffel), but overall it just seems to be missing something. Fortunately, while H and M are saving the world, Kumail Nanjani as Pawny (voice) is saving the film. His little character provides the most laughs and the most creative punchlines. The franchise has enough of a loyal following that the film should do fine, however it will be surprising if this one can replicate the success of the first 3 films ... although, you guessed it, the sequel to the spin-off is set up.",Men in Black - International
16,FlashCallahan,Marvel In Black....,7,25 June 2019,"The Men in Black have expanded to cover the globe but so have the villains of the universe.To keep the world safe, Agent Thor and rookie Valkyrie join forces.When aliens that can take the form of any human arrive on Earth, H and M (not the clothing company) embark on a globe-trotting adventure to save the world from their mischievous plans.Oh, and there is a mole in the MIB, who could it be? could it be one of the A-listers guest starring in this??MIB: International is a film made for people who thought the chemistry between Hemsworth and Thompson (not Emma) in Ragnarok was second to none. This is true, but they forgot to bring the writers this time.But, the studio didn't forget the cheque book, as we are treated to some sumptuous visuals in Marrakech, which really make the film worth watching.Other than that, it's just an excuse for Hemsworth and Thompson (not Emma) to have that buddy cop banter that we all loved in the eighties when Gibson and Glover were doing it so much better.Plot wise? It's all about a big gun that can destroy the earth, and the bad guys want it, and H and M try throughout the film to keep it from them.Every now and again, we have Liam Neeson barking Basil Exposition from his office, and Rafe Spall trying to get one over Chris Hemsworth every chnac ehe can.It's all predictable stuff, but it looks good, and Hemsworth and Thompson (not Emma) are quite brilliant together.And the film is book ended by a guest appearance from Thompson (Emma, not Tessa).So it's not Thor-ful, but far from Marvel-ous....",Men in Black - International

There IS NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON OR FAKE-LOOKING CGI ALIEN IN THIS MOVIE THAT'S REMOTELY AS GOOD AS either Jones or Smith. They weren't bad in this movie, but just did the adequate amount of work.I won't even go deep into explaining the plot except the least interesting main lead tracks down MIB to join them into becoming something very uninteresting.

21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Here come the Men In Black?,6,16 June 2019,"'Men In Black: International (2019)' doesn't have the charisma of Will Smith or pre-'Men In Black 3 (2012)' Tommy Lee Jones, the chemistry between those two stars or the charm of Barry Sonnenfeld's direction and world-building. Indeed, it's not so much 'MIB' as 'generic action sci-fi'. Still, it's not bad, by any means; if you divorce it of its franchise, it's probably even better. It's a competent, generally enjoyable film with solid performances and a solid story. There are some fun set-pieces, along with the occasional bit of inspired banter, and the central mystery is fairly well handled. Of course, the final 'reveal', if you will, is quite predictable, but that's primarily because it's quite cliché. In fact, the flick does a good job of keeping you on your toes throughout and could have, theoretically, unfolded in a number of ways - most of which would probably have been more interesting, to be fair. However, the villain's ultimate plan has a few 'holes', if you will, and lacks weight overall, feeling like it needs a bit of expansion to both make more sense (primarily in terms of motivation and time-scale) and have a greater impact. The humour also sometimes seems a little off-brand, pushing passed harmless innuendo and heading into darker territory; I mean, there's literally a gag involving what's, essentially, a rape. Typically, though, the piece plays as the buddy-comedy you'd expect. It doesn't do a lot to develop its world (it also seems to misunderstand the need for, or appropriate use of, the 'neuralyzer') and it's pretty much devoid of the prior titles' immigration allegories and imaginative imagery. Generally, it feels fairly generic. Still, it's quite enjoyable when it gets going. After a rushed first act, it moves at a decent pace and includes some interesting ideas. It manages to set itself apart from its predecessors with an intrigue-based plot and a distinct, if less interesting, style. Surely, that's better than a pale imitation or, worse, remake of 'Men In Black (1997)'? Like I said, it's entertaining enough. It's not quite 'MIB', but it's not bad. 6/10",Men in Black - International
22,bowmanblue,I soooo wanted to like this,5,15 June 2019,"I loved the original 'Men in Black' film and, contrary to the majority, I really enjoyed the two sequels that followed (I clearly had low expectations for them!). Plus, who can dislike Chris Hemsworth right now? He's one of the coolest, most charismatic actors working in Hollywood right now. I avoided most reviews before I watched this 'International' version, but I sort of heard that the opinion on whether this incarnation was any good was quite split down the middle.First of all, it is a direct sequel to part 3, i.e. it set in the same universe/timeline, but no appearances from either Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones to be found. I thought it was worth noting that point in these days of reboots, soft reboots and re-imaginings etc. Chris Hemsworth is already working for the shadowy agency who protects the general public from knowing about all the alien life coming and going from Earth and Tessa Thompson is the new recruit he takes under his wing when a new case arises.Apparently, there's something amiss in the MIB's London branch and Tessa Thompson's character, 'M' is sent there to partner up with Chris Hemsworth, 'H' in order to investigate. You get the usual stuff from a 'MIB' movie, i.e. plenty of slick-looking tech and random aliens wandering around. I couldn't help but think that the computer effects used to bring these creatures to life didn't look much better than the CGI first utilised in 1997 in the first outing of the franchise.They soon discover that there's a 'mole' in the agency, working against them from within. This kind of robs the storyline of a definite bad guy. The past three movies had a 'main alien' who they have to catch/fight. I know there are a couple of aliens who - sort of - fit that description, but it's clear that the main 'antagonist' of the story is unseen for the best part. I wouldn't mind that too much if it wasn't for the fact that - to me - the mole was clearly obvious from the start. Okay, to be fair it was a guess between two characters, but one was blatantly too annoying/obvious to actually turn out to be the bad guy.It's fair to say that when watching anything like 'Men in Black' (and almost any science fiction/horror film in general) you need to suspend your disbelief. Here, you REALLY need to suspend your disbelief. In fact, about every five minutes something happened where I totally rolled my eyes and shook my head as one plot device unfolded after the other, simply there to move the story to the next location. People just were able to walk into secret and heavily-guarded facilities at will and no one stopped them. The (so-called) most secretive agency on Earth basically operated in full view of the public and no one called this out. Scenes were set in broad daylight in London, Paris and New York involving lasers and spaceships and yet there wasn't a single civilian anywhere to notice any of these out-of-this-world incidents. Now, I know the two leads have both played superheroes in their time, but these MIB characters are distinctly human. Although, you might not notice based on the amount of punishment they take and then walk away without so much as a scratch.There was definite chemistry between the two leads and the fact they had starred together in the Marvel movies certainly helped. However, I felt that Tessa Thompson's character had a bit of the 'Mary Sue' about her. No, she wasn't half as bad as 'Rey' from the latest 'Star Wars' films, but 'MIB: International' spends much of its runtime telling us how intelligent she is and showing us just how capable she is. When she's left to just interact with her co stars she's really watchable and fun, but every scene seems to lead to something which shows us just how great she is and it all seems a little forced.I'm quite gutted at how many faults I kept picking out. I'm hardly a fussy devote of films. Most of my DVD collection contains cheesy horror and sci-fi, plus tonnes of those films that are just 'so-bad-they're-good' types. For some reason I just felt the writing here was so lazy and people developed new powers that they had never used before just to get themselves out of the latest situation. I like to think I can suspend my disbelief and enjoy a film, but this one was just a little bit too hard to find believable, even in a world as 'make believe' as this.",Men in Black - International
23,ThomasDrufke,A Waste of Time,4,22 June 2019,"The worst thing a film can be is forgettable, bland, and unnecessary. Sadly, Men in Black: International falls in line with all 3 of those. After hearing several critics talk about how generic the film was, I tried hard to pay attention to the convoluted plot and even in a movie flooded with actors I enjoy, it had a difficult time keeping my eye. Whether there were as many on set/script/production issues as reported, the movie is still just as unnecessary as we all figured when announced. The better idea would have been to go through with the Jump Street crossover, but my guess would be that the MIB franchise is more than likely dead. Any film that casts Rebecca Ferguson and wastes her talent by simply giving her one 10 minute scene doesn't deserve any attention.4.9/10",Men in Black - International

25,MLDinTN,"reboot, same ideas, new actors = mindless entertainment for 2 hours",6,30 December 2019,"This movie was a little better than expected. The special effects were very good, making it better than expected. Also Chris Hemsworth was perfect as the arrogant agent, not needing help but soon accepting it. In this reboot, a girl, named Agent M, finally finds the Men in Black headquarters and convinces them to take her as a recruit. So, she gets H to pick her as a partner and they are trying to find a traitor. It's pretty easy to guess whom the bad guy is. And the rest of the movie is pretty much the same as its predecessors.FINAL VERDICT: good for 2 hours of popcorn entertainment",Men in Black - International
26,Cineanalyst,Third Ragnorok from the Sun,3,18 October 2019,"It's not that ""Men in Black"" International"" fails to live up to the legacy of the first three installments in the franchise; it does, and that's what's deficient about it. Sure, it's perplexing as to why this fourth iteration is generally more panned than its predecessors and for the very things those other movies were, too: thinly plotted, unimaginatively manufactured, CGI bloated and relying upon the chemistry of the two leads. Indeed, that's what the entire series is about. It's a series about aliens, the great complexities of the universe and the hunt for knowledge, but it took four pictures before the agents ventured beyond New York for most of the runtime, and, then, it's only to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Some meager time traveling last episode aside, the Men in Black possess neuralyzers, which wipe and reorder memories, but the movies remain largely linear, predictable and, overridingly, simplistic, if riddled with plot holes and dull red herrings.So, this time we get the stars from ""Thor: Ragnorok"" (2017) instead of Tommy Lee Jones feigning indifference to Will Smith's antics. Maybe some find it to be less fresh (prince of Bel-Air) this time, but it's essentially the same thing they've repacked over four movies now. If anything, the casting of Thor and Valkyrie recalibrating their repartee here only highlights the earthbound tiresomeness of the formula and brand compared to an MCU that has firmly expanded intergalactically since ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). As with any at least half-hearted attempt at franchise building, a couple of veteran stars are also placed in supporting roles to lend the appearance of legitimacy; in this case, Emma Thompson returns, and Liam Neeson is added. And, this may not be the Men in Black crossover picture we were led to believe was happening, but the MCU borrowing is made more complete with the addition of a green pet to get in the middle of and to lighten the load of the lack of otherwise-expected sexual chemistry between the two leads. Pawny, Hulk, or Frank the Pug, for that matter--they're basically the same thing.",Men in Black - International
27,cricketbat,"A good sequel, but an average movie",6,14 June 2019,"As a sequel/spin-off, I think Men in Black: International got it right. They didn't rely too heavily on references to the past movies and they were able to expand the universe a bit. As a movie, however, it's only average. The story is predictable and the performances aren't anything special. I would put this one the same level as MIB 3.",Men in Black - International
28,westsideschl,Nothing of Value,2,20 September 2019,"Dialogue was canned, juvenile, simplistic & predictable. Acting was robotic & shallow like in memorize, recite, reshoot multiple times between the goofs best exemplified by the gags special features where they make fun of themselves saying & doing dumb things. Plot was same old mostly cartoonish aliens shopping or hanging out drinking/eating with a couple good ones & a couple of bad ones to relieve boredom. Props were cartoonish, made no sense, weapons w/cute little blue flashes, and vehicle shape changers that were mostly laughable.

29,The-Sarkologist,Just another MiB movie,5,16 June 2019,"Apparently these movies are actually based on a series of comic books, but honestly, I've never heard of them, even though I have pretty much seen all of the films. I guess the producers were looking to bring in some new blood, so they picked up Thor to play the lead, and of course we have Liam Neelson here as well (though he doesn't actually kill anybody in the film - which is very un-Neelson like of him).Basically this is pretty much like all of your other Men in Black films, nothing really all that different, though as I have suggested they have sort of gone back to the beginning where we have this young lady that just wants to get a piece of the action. Mind you, she basically tries each and every one of the agencies in the US, only to discover that they don't know about them either. She finally manages to get her foot in the door, and is sent to London to prove herself.Look, this movie really didn't grab me all that much, but then again it is a part of the MiB franchise, and it really isn't a franchise that I've been a really big fan off. Sure, there are a couple of laughs, and I did sort of enjoy it, but honestly, it really wasn't anything about it that could could actually call it a 'great' movie.",Men in Black - International

But I Liked It,7,14 June 2019,"I just got out of watching Men In Black: International.I didn't love it, but I certainly didn't hate it, and I have to say it was pretty enjoyable. I have to say my expectations were pretty low going in, I was not blown away by the trailers and I just wasn't interested in seeing it.For me, the only selling point of this movie was Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson teaming up after Thor: Ragnarok. I thought they had great chemistry and I think they played well off each other here. This is really Tessa Thompson's movie, she is the main star.Hemsworth is always good value (well except Blackhat) and he is fun here and got most of the laughs. There was a guy sat a few seats down from me who laughed out loud a lot, he really seemed to enjoy it. As always the effects really good and the ending was a tad emotional.One thing I didn't like, was I called the end, right at the beginning.Overall it was an enjoyable trip to the cinema.",Men in Black - International

33,Thanos_Alfie,Do not compare it with the original...,5,30 March 2021,"""Men in Black: International"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch Men in Black trying to protect Earth from the biggest threat. They have to find a super-weapon of mass destruction that is hidden somewhere on Earth as soon as possible.Since i had already watched the three previous movies of ""Men in Black"" franchise I understood that ""Men in Black: International"" is going to be completely different. So, I did not compare it with the previous movies and I advise you to do the same otherwise you won't enjoy it. The direction which was made by F. Gary Gray was very good and he did his best on it, presenting very well his main characters, their different personalities, their dreams and their goals in life. In addition to this, the combination of the interpretations of both Chris Hemsworth who played as Agent H and Tessa Thompson who played as Agent M was very clever and it fitted very well. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Men in Black: International"" is a nice, interesting and funny movie that I am sure it will entertain you and you will enjoy it, therefor I recommend you to watch it.",Men in Black - International
34,cruise01,Decent spin off that has great two leads but forgettable everything else.,6,16 June 2019,"Men in Black: International (3 out of 5 stars).Men in Black: International is a slight disappointment and a step backwards to the franchise. I mean the last few sequels have been a step backwards since the first movie. Which was the only good film there is. International is a sequel/spin-off focusing on new characters and a new location setting in London. The film follows Agent M (Tessa Thompson) who has always wanted to be in Men in Black since she first saw an alien as a child. While the agents wiped her parents memory, she managed to avoid getting spotted and remembered what they did. She applies for CIA, FBI, and all the top agencies to find the MiB. Until, she tracked down an alien sighting and managed to sneak into MiB. She gets recruited and joins Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) who is the agencies top agent. After he took down the Hive with his boss Agent T (Liam Neeson). When the Hive are apparently returning back on the planet. And are looking for some kind of weapon. Agent H and M are on the trail to who these aliens are. And why they are there.This film is a bit forgettable. The story is dull. There is not much of a story at all. And the villains who are twin like Aliens are forgettable. The character development is lacking with Agent H and M. Agent H follows up with his connections like an alien named Vungus. And his ex girlfriend being an alien named Riza (Rebecca Ferguson) which she has issues with him. All these new characters are just feeling forced and pushed into the story that seems lacking in investing in these characters.The action sequences are decent. With a few shoot outs and chases on a hover motor bike. A small alien that looks like a chess piece named Pawny was more entertaining than anyone else on here. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson are a perfect combo and looks like they could have great chemistry. The script is tedious and lacked in plot, development, and fun humor. There was nothing exciting to make this film worth while. The first film had a lot of fun cheesy humor and action. These sequels and this film the humor feels forced and boring. By the time you get to the predictable twist with the villain. You do not even care what was going on in the climax.Overall, Men in Black: International is a fair film. The talent had a perfect match but the script was lacking fun action, story, and character development. This film is decent to see but definitely is a forgettable sequel.",Men in Black - International
35,zkonedog,No Interesting Character Chemistry To Be Found,4,18 June 2019,"The original Men in Black trilogy of films combined science fiction, ground-breaking special effects, and just general ""coolness"" to produce three wildly successful movies. ""Men In Black: International"" has all of those three things in spades as well. The glaring missing ingredient, however? Whereas the first three films had incredible character chemistry, this one has none and it makes all the difference (in the worst way possible).For a basic overview, ""MIB: International"" sees audiences introduced to new agents H (Chris Hemsworth) & M (Tessa Thompson) as they embark on a globe-trotting adventure ostensibly to root out a mole within MIB.That may be the shortest plot overview I've ever written for a film, but in this case it rings true: ""International"" can never be called a plot-heavy film but any stretch of the imagination. It sort of goes from one thing to the next with very little connective tissue, in the end feeling as if it doesn't even itself remember what the main themes are.That being said, the original MIB films were exactly plot-driven epics either. But what's so obviously missing here is any sense of chemistry or character development in any of the new characters. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones played off each other expertly...their charisma really carried those films. Here? Hemsworth and Thompson (especially her) are decent enough in portraying what they are meant to, but there is absolutely no tension or even all that much camaraderie between them. They just sort of...exist together. Nothing more.Actors such as Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson try to pick up some of slack (and are good in their respective roles), but Hemsworth and Thompson are set up to be the star vehicles, and the film's success/failure will ultimately rest on that pairing. It's not a good sign that I didn't care one iota for either of them more than I did after the first 10-15 minutes.About the only positive I took from this experience? Thompson provides a great performance--as usual--and provides the only real pizazz or coolness to ""International"" whatsoever. I'd love to see her continue in the role, but unfortunately the total failure of this effort will likely not afford her the opportunity.Overall, ""MIB: International"" isn't as much a complete and utter failure as it is the definition of blandness. It has some tech, effects, aliens, chases, locales, etc. that one is never really bored during its runtime, but none of it really adds up to anything because the characters are so shallow or mismatched. Most likely a franchise-killer film, in all honesty.",Men in Black - International
36,eddie_baggins,A franchise ending misfire,2,3 October 2019,"To be perfectly honest to all involved in this box office dud, Men in Black: International should never have seen the light of day and you almost feel sorry for them being a part of such a lame, tame and unwanted extension of a franchise that started off great but has slowly and surely been getting worse as the year's wear on.Brilliantly teaming up the dead pan Tommy Lee Jones with the then on fire smart talking Will Smith, the original Men in Black was a comedic delight with the 2nd and 3rd installments failing to capture the magic again, in what felt like tired attempts to recapture the lightning in a bottle moments that appeared from a natural place at the start of the whole adventure, that now seem like light year's away from F. Gary Gray and his cast in International.Another key aspect of this film that badly tries to input a modern day sensibility to proceedings is the fact we are for some reason still calling the big dance Men in Black despite the fact International teams up Thor: Ragnarok playmates Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson together as agents of an alien filled world, making you wonder why a whole refresh of the brand wasn't the better way to go when the film's title barely matches what happens on screen in the studios quest to appease the new venture of turning all known properties into female star vehicles too varying successes.It's a perfect summation of everything that's wrong with International, with the whole affair feeling like a try-hard mission to be a funny action-packed sci-fi romp but coming off as nothing but a pale example of what not to do when given a big budget and a name brand property, in what is likely an experience that leaves die-hard MIB fans cold and disinterested in a series that now feels like its way past its use by date.In many ways this is a shame, as the world of MIB still feels like it has much still to be explored but after 3 failings since the 1997 original, it's safe to say that the studio won't be rushing back to unleash more of this universe on audiences and critics who all seemed to agree that this instantly forgettable blockbuster was all types of bad.On paper this result is somewhat unpredictable with Gray having some form behind the camera with efforts like The Italian Job, Law Abiding Citizen and Straight Outta Compton all entertaining in their own ways while Hemsworth and Thompson are some of the most engaging performers working currently and displayed fantastic chemistry together in Ragnarok, but that is not to be found here with their bland characters of Agent H and Agent M unable to stand out in a plot line that will have you rolling your eyes within the first few minutes.When all is said and done it wouldn't of mattered one bit if Hemsworth and Thompson could've added any extra spark to proceedings here as there's little to no life on show in a globe spanning feature that is bereft of laughs, originality or imagination, all taking place around a story that is hard to care about in any way, shape or form.Final Say -It's not hard to see why Men in Black: International became one of 2019's biggest critical and commercial failures, doing nothing but reminding us just how fun the first Men in Black film was, this looks set to have ended the once promising cinematic universe in one foul swoop of mistimed and mismanaged franchise rebooting.1 interrupted marriage proposal out of 5",Men in Black - International
37,leonblackwood,Poor script but decent visual effects! 4/10,4,11 February 2020,"Review:
Visually, this film wasn't that bad, but the script was awful and the acting didn't suit the concept. The silly jokes got on my nerves after a while, and I got a bit fed up with Chris Hemsworth (Agent H), acting the fool. The fact that Tessa Thompson (Agent M) wasn't shocked about the whole ""alien world on earth"" concept, made the film extremely far fetched and ridiculous in places. On the plus side, Pawny, voiced by Kumail Nanjiani, made me laugh, and Emma Thompson was great as Agent O but she wasn't in the movie that much. The reason why the first movie worked so well, was because we had the seriousness from Tommy Lee Jones (Kay) and the jokes from Will Smith (Jay), but in this film, the two main characters are spilling out these one-liners that were just not that funny. I didn't hear anything positive about the film, so I wasn't expecting something close to the first movie, but with a great cast, and the fantastic chemistry between Hemsworth and Thompson in Ragnarok, I thought there would have been a couple of memorable moments, which there wasn't. The whole Neeson (Agent High T) concept was predictable, and Rebecca Ferguson was wasted as Riza, so the director and the writers are totally to blame for this failure. In terms of the visual effects, it did look amazing in parts, and I liked the various aliens who made the film watchable, but apart from that, I was left feeling pretty disappointed. Although the movie made a profit at the box office, there aren't any rumours about another MIB movie, so it's obvious that they are listening to the critics, who were also disappointed with the outcome. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, who also brought you Friday, Set It Off, The Negotiator, A Man Apart, The Italian Job, Be Cool, Law Aboding Citizen, Straight Outta Compton and Fast & Furious 8. He's also made various music video's for artist like Cypress Hill, Coolio, TLC, Dr. Dre, R. Kelly and Will Smith, so he has had a versatile career to date. Personally, he wouldn't have been the perfect candidate to direct this film, mainly because he hasn't had any experience in this field, and judging by the outcome, I can't see him returning for a 5th MIB any time soon. I've always wondered what will happen to some of the Avengers cast, once the franchise had come to a halt, and I do worry for Chris Hemsworth, who hasn't shown much range since he departed as Thor. There are rumours of another Thor movie, called Thor: Love & Thunder, which is supposed to be a sequel to Ragnarok, but it's not in development as of yet. Taika Waititi is rumoured to be in the director's chair again, so I'm really looking forward to it, but we have to wait until 2021 if it sees the light of day.Budget: $110million

38,TheMovieDiorama,Men in Black International had me wanting to be neuralysed over and over again.,2,15 June 2019,"I can't. I physically have so much rage within me after watching this, that I'm struggling to keep myself together for the betterment of this review. I'm done. This unnecessary sequel has officially cemented this year's summer blockbuster season as one of the worst in recent memory. Hollywood has clearly exhausted every possible uninspired route, and this galactic mess just takes the chocolate biscuit. A young girl who seemingly avoided becoming neuralysed, hunts down the MiB organisation in a bid to join them. She teams up with a hotshot agent in London and must stop an evil extraterrestrial race known as 'The Hive' from acquiring a world destroying weapon.The original Men in Black and, to an extent its sequel, was a product of its time. Computer generated effects were popularised by 90s blockbusters. A charismatic Will Smith at the height of his star power. And, let's not forget, an unpredictably hilarious chemistry between his typically grumpy co-star. It was sci-fi magic, an adventure for all families to enjoy. Fast forward twenty years and we have this sequel. International. Out with old and in with the new, I believe that's how the saying goes right? So clearly, using that phrase literally, this was to be the best instalment yet? Eh, wrong! So wrong! Couldn't be any more wrong! So far wrong, that right is now neuralysed and convinced itself to be wrong. This isn't just the worst summer blockbuster of the year. This is in contention for worst film of the year. Period.What makes it so irrefutably terrible you might be wondering? Well, where to even begin! Let's start with the biggest culprit, the screenplay. For a joyous adventure about extraterrestrial life secretly cohabiting with humanity, there's no joy to be had. A forgettable plot that resembled a carbon copy of its predecessors but excluding any memorable factors. Menacing alien force trying to destroy the world? Blah. Annoying miniature Jar-Jar Binks minion used simply for comedy relief? No, thank you. Sheer amount of plot conveniences (the whole ""Molly"" thing? Come on!!) to swiftly move the dull story along? Excessive. The writers took the word ""International"" literally, and shoved as many global locales in as possible in order to differentiate itself from the previous titles. Problem is, that the array of one-dimensional supporting characters were scribbled in such a flurry that the story itself rapidly became boring and uneven. The entire film felt like it belonged in the 90s. It hadn't evolved with today's standards. The quips and jokes were far too painstakingly forced that it irked me instead of making me howl with laughter (although no film ever does that...). Every line of dialogue, and I'm not exaggerating, was horrific. Absolutely dreadful.Changing up the dynamic between the leads, again, was a faux pas. Smith and Jones worked because of their unlikely bond (oh, and a decent script assisted too!). Hemsworth and Thompson was just 'Thor: Ragnarok Part 2'. Seriously, they play the exact same characters as they did in a Nordic superhero extravaganza. Hemsworth activates ""comedy"" mode and acts the same way as he does in all of his other comedy ventures. Thompson, who clearly has a considerable amount of talent, just wasn't given anything meaningful. She did the best she could, and by no means is a bad aspect to this atrocity, but my word was the line delivery bland. The female and male dynamic should've created a more engaging experience, but it was just used for a gag about 'Men and Women in Black'. Coercing a film to be politically correct without physically utilising that standpoint consequently results in the end product being empty. And basically, the film is just that. Empty.Gray is unable to explore the imaginative world that Sonnenfeld lovingly crafted and instead focused his intentions on uninspired action set pieces that were jarringly edited. The hoverbike sequence in Marrakesh for example was plagued with quick cuts, maximum zoom and highly dependent on grotesque visual effects. But that's just one example of several set pieces that were technically inept, harnessing an unnecessary amount of obvious green screen backdrops. A predictable plot reveal unravels and the final act of desperation unveils itself to be a two minute showdown holding no substance whatsoever. Then suddenly the story wraps up and we're jetting off into the distance. Happily. Ever. After.Empty. Boring. Pointless. I'm seriously struggling to find any redeeming factors. Aside from the two Thompsons turning a dreadful script into something tolerable, this completely unnecessary sequel just about wiped me out. Where were the array of memorable aliens? Why was Ferguson in this? Why as this even commissioned? I'm not one for wanting a film to perform badly at the box office, but I seriously hope this flops. If this is the future for Hollywood productions, that being the disguising of lazy re-hashes into being franchise resurrections, then I don't want anything to do with it. Just neuralyse me now. In fact, give me the neuralyser and I'll do it myself! Meh in Black.",Men in Black - International
39,matthewssilverhammer,Men in Bleh-ck,1,21 June 2019,"There's an easy joke for a critic of this film to make: ""I wish I could use that mind-erasing neuralyzer to forget how bad this movie is!"" That reference is not only hacky, but irrelevant. For something to be erased from your memory, it must have some sort of impact on your brain. This 20+ year old franchise has always been hit-and-miss, but it's never been this boring. Men in Black: International is so utterly unremarkable and forgettable that it basically works as its own mind-erasing neuralyzer.
Spinning off from the original trilogy following Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, we find new, precocious MiB recruit Tessa Thompson being shown the ropes by a less-than-enthusiastic elder agent in Chris Hemsworth. Hilarity is supposed to ensue from there, but unfortunately this is a classic case of the best moments existing in the trailer; even more unfortunately, those trailers aren't good.
It all suffers from an anemic script that offers nothing of value to a franchise that should've stayed dormant. None of the storytelling shows a hint of passion or care by the filmmakers, painting in cliched plot points and nonsensical character moments just to simply get from one moment to the next. Worst of all, it's oppressively unfunny, substituting actual humor for annoying sarcasm and side-eyed cynicism.
It's desperately missing the dry delivery of Jones and charismatic strength of Smith. Not that Thompson and Hemsworth aren't talented, but they don't have the specific skills to elevate such wretched material; though I'm not sure anyone would. With sci-fi this uninspired, a mystery this uninteresting, and comedy this lazy, MiB: International is one of the most unwatchable movies I've seen in awhile.",Men in Black - International

41,southdavid,Come Get Your Black Bin Bags.,5,2 July 2019,"Man, this was hard work. Just a chore to get through.Twenty years after an alien encounter opened her eyes to the secret world of The Men In Black, Molly (Tessa Thompson) tracks down the MIB headquarters. Impressed by her aptitude, she's hired and sent to the London bureau to investigate rumours that the operation may have been compromised. She's teamed with Agent ""H"" (Chris Hemsworth) an agent whose reputation was made thwarting an invasion a few years previously but whose reliance on his instincts over research may have made him a liability.I'm not sure here whether the problem lies with Hemsworth himself, or with the writers and director of the film, but I felt that the fatal flaw of the film was with his character. At no point do they really commit as to who he is and whether his character actually has any flaws that can be exploited for comedic purposes. I can understand why they struggled because there's an internal logic that the MIB would just kick out a useless agent but that uneasiness with who the character is, and how far to take his failings, permeates all his relationships. It makes the whole film... awkward. The conversations are stunted and clumsy and (with the writing) make for humourless run. It's so odd, given the natural chemistry that Thompson and Hemsworth have shown in Ragnorok but there's very little of that here.It's not the only issue, it's a dull pedestrian plot with a twist that you'll not only guess, but also work out exactly what's happened hours before the leads do and the villains, in fact all the aliens, are retreads of things we've seen before either in terms of appearance or motivations.It's not totally without merit, the effects are generally pretty good and the second half of the film is better than the first. . . but it's scant reward for an experience that you'll beg to have neuralised.",Men in Black - International

Elaborate alien designs, barely held together masquerade hiding those aliens from muggles, sleek gadgets, spiffy suits, cute miniature sidekicks. And the kitchen sink too.Hemsworth and Thompson are also quality actors and the addition of talents such as Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson doesn't exactly hurt the film.And yet my excitement levels never really rose above mild cheer. Mainly because I had a hard time distinguishing this film from the previous three. It's just more of the same. In good and bad.It's not a bad film by any means. Perfectly serviceable popcorn entertainment and the production values are certainly high enough to warrant the price of admission alone.

I did like Men In Black 1-3. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones had a great odd couple like chemistry, has well having good alien like effects.
Now Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thomson has great chemistry in Thor : Ragnarok, but here it feels a little forced, like they are trying to duplicate it, but I can see how much they where trying. Chris Hemsworth is oftenly good at being humorous, but here when he does it feels like he keeps missing the mark every time. Tessa Thomson who I liked here but was giving very little for her do. And Liam Neeson looks out of place here. Now the effects are the only thing good here, pretty much the reason I'm not going any lower.",Men in Black - International
45,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,13 October 2019,"Well... this was another sequel that no one asked for, at all and we can probably honestly say that this is a huge reason why it flopped.I had absolutely no interest in seeing another sequel of MIB, especially one without Will Smith, and especially one that is gender-swapped and rests closer to the reboot mark than the remake mark.Which are all reasons why I didn't see it until it came around for free.And as predicted while all but rebooting the franchise, it also attempts to make a political statement with the jokes coming from ""laugh because you agree with this"" type of humor, which rarely actually lands. And as a result it feels like SNL doing MIB in a sequel no one asked for.",Men in Black - International
46,stevendbeard,"Overall, A Good Reboot",7,15 June 2019,"I saw ""Men in Black:International"", starring Chris Hemsworth-the Thor movies, Red Dawn_2012; Tessa Thompson-the Thor movies, the Creed movies; Emma Thompson-Johnny English Strikes Again, the Harry Potter movies and Liam Neeson-Ted 2, the Taken movies.
This is sort of a reboot-no Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones, although they do make an appearance in a painting-of the M.I.B. franchise, which is based on a comic book. The first movie was in 1997, the second in 2002 and the third in 2012 so it's been about seven years since we've had an adventure of the agents that protect the world from alien menaces. Chris-Agent H-is the best agent in the organization and likes to work alone. Emma, a civilian, discovers their secret and decides she wants in on the action-she becomes Agent M. Emma-Agent O-is the head of the New York branch and sends Tessa to the London branch on a probationary trail basis, to see if she has what it takes to become a full fledged agent. Liam-Agent High T-is the head of the London office and he saddles Tessa with Chris, well, because he is their best agent, you know. They run into some alien twins-played by real life brothers and dancers of some repute, Laurent & Larry Bourgeois, aka, Les Twins. Chris & Tessa also have to deal with the fact that there just might be a mole in the M.I.B. that is trying to disrupt everything. I thought that Chris and Tessa worked well together and had good chemistry so overall, I think it is a good reboot.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi action, language and some suggestive material and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Men in Black - International

49,alindsay-al,A Below Average weak sequel,4,3 July 2019,"I am a huge fan of the first Men In Black film so had a bit of anticipation for this film but overall it was really disappointing. The premise of the film sees a new agent of the Men In Black have to team up with a veteran agent to uncover a plot to destroy the planet. Tessa Thompson & Chris Hemsworth play the two main agents in this film and to be honest they have pretty good chemistry in the film which you would expect due to the films that they have worked together in recently. There characters though are pretty bland and cliche and though their performances are decent there characters just weren't anything unique and quite generic. The supporing cast are a mixed bag, Liam Neeson plays the head of London's MIB and he is what you would expect, he is good in his role and is just very Liam Neeson like. But Rebecca Ferguson has a smaller role in the film and she is absolutley wasted in this role and her talents are not used as effectively as it could be. Emma Thompson is used a lot in the promotion for this film but is barely in this film and again is a porr show, the character of Pawney just annoyed me and didn't really provide great comedic value I thought. The story to me was just so bland and it just doesn't really work, there is nothing interesting involved and this film isn't as clever as it thinks it is. You will see the twists coming from a mile away and it was the only thing this film could have executed well and they failed. The script has some decent banter in it between the two leads due to their good chemistry, but the drama just doesn't work. The style of the film has some fun action scenes that will keep you entertained in typical Men In Black fashion, but the apcing of this film is just all over the place. There are certain things that are bought up and then completely ignored for the rest of the film and this film just drags and does feel longer then it actually is. Overall this is a pretty bland film that possibly kills this franchise which is a bit of a shame.",Men in Black - International

As turnout, Liam Neeson is a disguise alien in the agency and he objective is to retrieve the weapon from Vungus to take over the earth! A bit letdown of both female and male lead actor! Not as good as both role in Ragnarok! Not enough chemistry and lead male actor act like he is drunken all the way in this film! Maybe he is not yet recover from his role in Endgame! Lol! Have several action scene, but just fancy enough with the CG, not satisfy at all! Most intense one is when the two lead role actor fight with Riza in her house at Italy! This scene had some intense martial art in it! The shooting scene at London and the Morocco motorbike chasing scene just fancy enough with the CG effect! Even ending also not epic enough!

I genuinely like Chris Hemsworth rap as ""Thor"" in the Marvel universe & he was hilarious in the excellent but underrated ""Ghostbusters"" reboot & even here he's fun & funny if abit over the top often but he's still funny & charming but he's much more like James Bond than an Agent of the MIB & the film feels like a James Bond film & i did feel the loss of the incredible duo & chemistry of Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones, they're so good together & i missed them here & it really didn't feel like an MIB film without them!!!
So yeah Chris Hemsworth as H & his new partner Tessa Thompson as Molly are good together but got nothing special between them like ""Smith & Jones"" but there's some good bits & some funny bits & some cool guns & gadgets but it all felt too modernised for my liking & like i said it's missing the Magic of the BRILLIANT Trilogy.

In this curiously flat outing (in spite of the track record of the leads), the usual formula of a buddy action movie (2 opposite forces come together to save the world) plays out but a lot of the motivations here are eliding upon just to get to whatever action set piece or CG spectacle leaving crucial character development by the wayside. Emma Thompson returns from Part 3 who sends Tessa to the English branch of the MIB to work a case but I think this is where the film loses itself since I believe director F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton/Set it Off) is a West Coast guy so why not situate the story there & tell it w/the verve of someone who knows the richness of the minority culture while incorporating it into a MIB adventure which in those environs would be a no brainer but we have to sit through mildly interesting European venues (w/new cast member Liam Neeson) w/a late villain twist (saw it coming from the first reel) & a rehash of the ending face-off from the first film to end things on.",Men in Black - International

58,aidanratesmovies,"Entertaining, but certainly has its issues",7,18 June 2019,"Though the film may seem to be lacking the charm, creativity, and just plain depth of the originals (or at least the first and the third), Men in Black: International still proves to be a fun and entertaining ride, especially for fans of the franchise. It's clear Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson aren't nearly the match for Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, but their performances are certainly not terrible. They try their best with the material given and provide the screen with some wonderful chemistry fans of Thor will be pleased to see return. The film is needless to say, written poorly, and seems to struggle on where it wants to go and how it wants to get there. But even though the story is often a mess, the new atmosphere and call backs to the original films are wonderful and truly encapsulates us in this type of universe. Other standouts of the film include but are not limited to Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson, two actors that only a few years ago I would never have expected to be in a Men in Black film. Kumail Nanjiani's character does provide for some disappointment however, as he proves to be more of an annoyance than the comic relief type feel the script seems to be going for. All in all, the film has its issues, and plenty of them to spare, but makes up for it with its entertaining nature, lovely chemistry from its two main stars, and cool atmosphere. Though it wouldn't be the wisest decision for Sony to let us see these characters again in another film, it certainly wouldn't bug me to see them as a cameo somewhere in a possible Men in Black 4.

62,jadepietro,Dull and Duller,4,19 June 2019,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Another tired and uninspired sequel.JIM'S REVIEW: There are just a few changes made in F. Gary Gray's misfire, Men in Black International, just enough to make this chapter in the franchise yet another example of the latest boring sequel from a series that seems to get progressively worse. This installment follows the same basic formula used in the other movies without much humor or interesting banter. Gone are Agent J and Agent K, supposedly neutralized from our memory. Enter the new younger breed of galactic heroes, Agent H (Chris Hemsworth), the charming rebellious rogue type, and Agent M (Tessa Thompson), an eager-to-please new recruit. Let's hope the rest of the alphabet is spared, although Agent Zzz was present.The screenplay by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway is a mess. It involves a hostile takeover by alien villains called the Hive who can shape-shift into nicely designed CGI creatures, although their personality and interest level is a zero...which is significantly better than Mr. Hemsworth and Ms. Thompson's screen persona. Their non-chemistry in this movie barely registers at a minus 2. The plot buzzes around the globe from Paris and London to Marrakesh with many stupefying chases, poorly staged fights, and uninspired baddies that do little to advance the story. There is mentioned of the existence of a mole planted in the organization, but that plot-line is repeatedly interrupted by the so-called action and many special effects. The twist ending isn't surprising, but at least, the filmmakers tried to be innovative.Most, no make that, all of the cast has done better work. My condolences to Emma Thompson (no relation to Tessa, in words or acting), Rafe Spall, Rebecca Ferguson, and Liam Neeson, whose bad hair dye job is the film's scariest effect. Kumail Nanjiani does some fine voiceover work as Pawny, a friendly CGI extraterrestrial. The character is meant to be a cute and funny sidekick, but comes off as coy and annoying due to the script's witless dialog. As for the lead actors, Mr. Hemsworth has shown his fine comic timing to full effect in other films. In this one, he is all smirk and swagger. Ms. Thompson (as in Tessa, not remotely an Emma) is simply bland.Mr. Gray's direction is sub-standard, lacking any style or grace. There are no real builds and very little tension in this disappointing movie. Except for some nifty CGI, this is one dull adventure after the next. One wishes that Men in Black International can be erased from my mind and fade from memory rather quickly.",Men in Black - International

The Political Messages... againSUMMARY:A Men In Black Movie is all about being an entertaining spectacle of comedy, story, and latching on to our heroes and finding some moving pieces. This new installment may not have our favorite agents we started with (in physical form at least), but it holds a few treasured components that kept it entertaining for me. For one it's a movie with few slow parts, moving from one component to the next with little time for impasses to really drive character development, but maximize laughs and entertainment. The New aliens and designs are refreshing in the component that they are bringing back the creativeness that brings renewed energy into the series, especially in regards to some of the new criminal aliens who have edge and artistic designs mixed in. With all the newness you might be fretting that the old feeling has been lost, and to be honest I found some qualities that still remain to be fun and remind you of the older days. For one there is plenty of nostalgia lining this movie, maybe not in the full integration of other movies have done, but certainly a few nods to the adventures our first band had. Simplistic story still stays strong as well, with little twists and turns to spin your head or make you think, but not so simplistic to be absolutely stupid or boring, for the most part any way. The key thing that stays here though is the humor, finding the same formula of modern times by cramming jokes in as many styles as possible. That variety is good, bringing some dynamic choices to the mix to try and cater to a number of audience members and hopefully leaving you in tears. Yet the winner for me is Kumail's character Pawny. The Middle Eastern actor's character left me in stitches bringing his usual brand of comedic delivery with well time interruptions that were perfect for me. In addition the character remains pertinent to the story as well, only having a few times where his manners were forced on me. An excellent character for this reviewer.Yet for all the good they did for me, the modern reboot of the series has not achieved the goals that the first series did for me. For one thing, more aliens could have been introduced, or even better integrated into the mix. All the introductions and new designs should have had a little more time to brew to perfection and perhaps be relevant to the inclusion outside of a joke or two. Villains, supporting characters, even the main heroes felt underutilized to me, simplistic shells of main characters that hold secrets, but like the organization remain hidden. As such, I did not get quite attached to these two new agents like I did K and J, and that leads to a less engaging story for me overall. In regards to the story itself, well that too is sort of lacking. Don't get me wrong, it's got the components famous in this series, but they were not as well put together because of the new approach. It's predictable for one thing and leaves little surprise in how things are going to pan out from obvious foreshadowing. Story elements started being hinted at, but then the plot lines fell flat or remained sort of untied, perhaps in suggesting a future installment. The fact that the characters are quite as engaging leaves flat pieces to play out, who become more focused on comedy than being a hero. Most of all, the story is just missing that campiness overall that the 90s made famous and that took away some of the things that made the first trilogy special. Without that factor, that natural humor was sort of lacking, forced upon me much like the ghostbusters from a couple of years ago. They almost try too hard for me and at times that obvious digression from the story to make a joke id not impress me as much. This is especially true with the political humor, once again trying to force emotional surges into the movie to deliver the real-life issues. Sometimes the writing was perfect and well-integrated, but often it fell to deaf ears because it was not needed, potentially left to the interviews and subconscious meetings than anything else.Overall, the film turned out to be fun and entertaining. The modern twist is far from perfect, but it shows the series can age well with the right guidance and motivation. It still needs balance and shying away from the forced jokes, alongside crafting characters that I actually care about instead of the comedic, political husks I was getting. Men In Black International though has plenty of old and new blended in and the new little guy Pawny should certainly make up for a number of flaws given his character ironically has more layers than the leading cast. Due to the special effects, this one lands in the see in theaters territory, so check it out, but in terms of the quality movie overall, you can probably check this one out at home to be honest. So my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0",Men in Black - International
64,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Men in Black: International,4,16 June 2019,"Men in Black: International is a ho-hum sequel and my latest review. Billed as gimmick-ed science fiction with overseas flavor (hence the salient title), ""International"" feels more like a cutesy kids comedy than anything else. Call it The Phantom Menace of the Men in Black franchise. Call it pubescent tongue-in-cheek. Call it ""men without tact"". And just like the neuralyzer used in ""International"", you'll forget about the film the moment you exit the theater (for the record, I feel the original Men in Black wasn't that great to begin with).Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth replace Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as the new Men in Black leads. They are strapping, good-looking people who can act but they are saddled with an elongated, cringe-worthy screenplay. Yup, with game Liam Neeson signing on in a nixed supporting role, everyone comes off as a little haphazard here.In Men in Black: International, Thompson and Hemsworth's characters have to save the E.T.-surplussed world while trying to find a mole in the Men in Black organization (you as the viewer could spot it a mile away). At an almost two-hour running time, it's hard to take ""International"" seriously. There's the usual shiny gadgets (which I like), a little bit of the action, some wonted special effects, too much of the drollness, and sadly, a lot of the disposable.In conclusion, the biggest reason these Men in Black movies continue to get made is strictly a financial one (the four installments have garnered over a billion dollars worldwide). Based on the sparse amount of people at the screening I just attended, that trend might just end. Bottom line: If you must see Men in Black: International, head to a dollar movie theater, bring the kiddies (if you have any), take in the pseudo surround sound, and try to enjoy the Styrofoam popcorn. Rating: 1 and a half stars.",Men in Black - International

I saw this movie in Dolby Cinema in a cropped aspect ratio from the original matte ratio seen in the trailers despite having great audio and really liked the good pacing of the film, which is the longest in the franchise. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, fresh from appearing in Thor 3 and Endgame, are the new agents in town.

69,vengeance20,It was mediocre.,4,18 June 2019,"I had low & sort of half & half hopes for this film. I have to say I was right for the most part on the lows & half & half with the highs.The films story-line is ok for what it is but the reasoning for the female co lead seems forced & there to appease feminists & left wingers. I mean, ok, it could be that she wanted to know about aliens & that it was legitimately written that way for the film. But in this world where political correctness is not only rife & shoved down your throat & in you face EVERYWHERE YOU GO, not to mention being laced in & currently corrupting today's film industry, really makes me question that & the other niggles I picked up on from viewing this film.With that being said, there was a good couple hints & digs of feminism & empowerment in this film, I mean seriously I smelt this a mile off when I seen the poster! How many times are film going to keep shoving this crap down out throats!? Leave PC out of our films!! Also stop with the women belittling men or men being made dumb to elevate bring strong female leads! It's really pathetic & so UN-equal! I mean to be fair, it wasn't all bad, but still it was enough to warrant the rating I gave! These idiots can't seem to help themselves, it's really sad & pathetic!Other than that, the film was ok, but forgettable. The action was alright, the effects were alright, but the film lacks the gritty classic quality the first 2 films had & the main leads in the fire 2 & 3rd film 7 years ago.Overall, mediocre, but Political Correctness once again ruins this film. 4/10",Men in Black - International

Also, I liked MIB 2, so calling it ""the worst sequel"" since MIB 2 does not ring true for me. I disliked MIB 3 also. Too violent. Alas, it's the same old thing once again, as the universe and Earth are always on the verge of total destruction by evil warlike aliens. (Bug Eye Monsters with tentacles.) Cars that turn into space ships. Aliens disguised as humans. It reprises a few of the past characters and then moves on. It's fun to watch because of the great chemistry between the two main co-stars. Not really as bad as the critics said, but it was not financially successful!

Nope. There's no amount of actor charm capable of elevating such a slapdash, clunky and utterly dull reboot that goes from weakness to weakness over its excruciating (nearly) two hours runtime. The flaws start with the script; a concoction of lazy clichés, signposted plot turns and unintentionally ridiculous dialogue, the jokes landing with all the amusement of a punch in the genitals. F. Gary Gray's direction doesn't exactly turn the tide either, the action sequences are messy, filled to the brim with atrocious visual effects and straight up boring. If ever there felt like a 'paycheque movie' for a filmmaker, this is it. The leading duo give it their best - Hemsworth all goofy self-deprecation as the famed Agent H whilst Thomson plays it calm and cool as the new-kid-on-the-block Agent M - but they don't find the same level of chemistry they had in Thor: Ragnarok. Elsewhere Liam Neeson phones in a yawn-inducing turn as head of the London MIB branch, Rebecca Ferguson is awkward as infamous arms-dealing creature Riza, and Kumail Nanjiani is the standout (low bar) as the voice of an over-confident 2-inch tall alien soldier. A complete waste of time and a low point for all involved, MIB: International will offer very little even to the least-demanding of cinema goers.

I would give it one more star had I watched previous sequels, because it would probably make more understanding.

The story is rubbish but I was expecting that.This is a fun family movie with action and some jokes and some dazzling good effects.This movie has received some bad ratings saying that it isn't as good as the first one. They are right, but that is to be expected for a third sequel.

How is that I like a, in words of almost everybody, terrible reboot if I didn't like the superior original? I'm pretty sure is not the script, predictable like few. The characters? I don't think so. They are somehow original, but their arcs are also too predictable and too simplistic. It can't be a perfect story without plot holes, because it does have plenty of them (or at least questionable parts).And still. The movie just got me with time. Slowly, and with better humor than I expected (the reason I didn't go to the theater was that I thought ""Thor Ragnarok lame humor then... hard pass""), with ironic, sarcastic and ridiculous well written (for the most part) jokes, coming from the personalities of the characters (and not changing them to make a cheap laugh, like... Ragnarok), plus amazing special effects and superb design of the villains, the villains powers and all the creatures in the movie, the movie started to make me enjoy regardless of the horrors of the script (one in particular incredibly awful, about 'what is love' and why 'we can't trust it') and the plot holes.By the end, I was into this movie so much that it was a blast, even if it is visually just fine (besides the great special effects), ok acting without space for much, a simplistic story and a weak script, with ""dumb feminism"" or ""fake feminism"", based only in a handful of ""out of nowhere"" and striking lines that feel more ""inserted in"" to justify the reboot as more than a cash grab.So no.

The sequel was good enough, and even III had its moments despite not really needing to exist. When I saw the trailer for International, I thought it genuinely looked bad. The idea of a new cast and a bit of a re-imagining of sorts is good but not for this franchise. You can tell this film is labored just from the trailer. MIB: International is about as average and forgettable as they get and is the worst in the series for me.The film follows Molly, a woman who was obsessed with finding out more about the Men in Black and then becomes a probationary agent along with the help of Agent H. There are recent attacks occurring around the globe and the pair must band together to put an end to it and uncover the mystery it carries. Thor: Ragnarok costars Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth star in this, along with the voice of Kumail Nanijiani, Liam Neeson, and a criminally underused Emma Thompson. F. Gary Gray, who is an otherwise solid filmmaker took the reigns for this.Best part of this film are Hemsworth and Thompson and the chemistry they possess. Outside of that the film, is boring and forgettable. I feel like the plot is incredibly stale and not worthy of being adapted for the big screen. If there was ever any magic in this franchise you definitely cannot see it here. The effects don't look very good, the humor in it feels like it was written by a fifth grader, and there's just a general lack of interest in what's going on.I didn't expect a whole lot with this film but my fears from the trailer were basically confirmed. Listen, this film feels like it should have came out a decade or two ago. It just feels like such a forgettable summer blockbuster. I felt like I was watching something in the universe of R.I.P.D. and not MIB.

Hemsworth is very black suitable for the viewing, if you will, and Liam Neeson is very nice as well. I love this movie! 10 stars, I mean 6. MIB: International has a linear, comprehensive storyline to follow though a rather weak plot really so that tackled with the one dimensional main characters who act with the same attitude all throughout kind of makes for a really fun adventure with plenty of room for improvement though very worth watching and truly enjoyable.

However, I really miss Will Smith's character from the Men in Black trilogy. I like the fact, that they showed multiple gorgeous locales in this movie. The action set pieces are amazing, and the set piece in Marrakesh is unforgettable. The visual effects are fantastic. All the aliens look sufficiently realistic. The 3D is superb. Chris Hemsworth is spectacular as Agent H. Tessa Thompson is outstanding as Agent M. Hemsworth & Thompson share that natural & effortless chemistry & camaraderie that they also shared in Thor: Ragnarok(2017) & Avengers: Endgame(2019).

Its story is mediocre and way too predictable, regardless of how much you try to tell yourself during the film that it's not just to be proven wrong. It isn't able to be funny no matter how much Chris Hemsworth tries to make a fool out of himself, it isn't interesting enough to be enjoyable and definitely not thrilling enough to generate some emotions. Although it has a twist in the middle, which can be seen from miles, it's not capable of a solid performance which you can actually enjoy.As pluses, you get a couple of jokes from time to time, some good CGI and some action-packed scenes, a couple of actors which try to make it all look good but they're outnumbered by the plot and basically, that's about it.

We do not have Tommy Lee Jones (by far the funniest thing in the series) neither Will Smith (too pedantic particularly in the last two installments) but we have the couple from THOR RAGNAROK both good comedians and bunch of additional British players that play along.
The first joke is obviously on the #MEETOO# movement and feminine inclusion.
Chris Hemsworth is the kind of great comedian that has no problem to let his partner shine. And Tessa Thomson really does it.
In terms of action there is a little less than the previous films but the comedy situations abound and some are really smart.
There are also some animated characters that complement the fun. The story itself is not too different but some ""sexy"" situations had been added making a sometimes more mature PG 13 movie. Do not be afraid; you can go with your kids .In brief; compared with every other blockbuster in theaters today; this one is the funniest and one of the best.

94,bob-the-movie-man,"Lazy, formulaic and pretty pointless.",3,22 June 2019,"""Men in Black International"", without Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones, looked like a mistake and indeed it proved to be so.It's a patchy story at best. New rookie MiB agent ""M"" (does this mean there are never more than 26 of them around the world?) played by Tessa Thompson teams up with 'dreamboat' agent H (Chris Hemsworth) to try to prevent an evil alien entity called ""The Hive"" from taking ownership of an ultimate weapon, currently in possession of H's regal alien friend Vungus. H & M go to protect Vungus. But two Hive operatives (played by Laurent and Larry Bourgeois) are way ahead of them. How did they know? Is there a more dangerous enemy? A mole within the MiB organization itself?Thompson and Hemsworth! Back on the screen together again! The ""Ragnarok"" part 2 we've all been waiting for! Turn the sizzle-o-meter up to 11 and stand well back! Er... no. Landed with a truly dire script to perform, the duo's on-screen chemistry just never materialises. Tessa Thompson is actually fine, but Chris Hemsworth just seems to be a monotone and annoyingly glib ""Thor"" redux. It came as a genuine shock to me at the end of the film, where sad scenes of parting are required, that there was supposed to be any emotional attachment between the couple developed at all. Very poor and disappointing.The script is by two of the ""Iron Man"" writers, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, so you might think it should have legs: but, no, the screenplay is incredibly clunky. It might appeal to 10 to 12 year olds (though the film has a UK 12A certificate), but it serves little other than to rather randomly connect the action scenes.Kevin Maher's waspish review in ""The Times"" rather cynically referred to the dialogue as being simple enough to be ""easily dubbed"" (into Chinese). But having seen the film, I fear there is a lot of truth in that.I'll admit I've never been a massive fan of the Men in Black films, but at least Barry Sonnenfeld's original trilogy had some verve and originality. Here Sonnenfeld has ducked, and ""Fate of the Furious"" director F. Gary Gray has the reins. And it feels like a distant relative to the originals.

Honestly, I haven't watched any Men In Black films before. So, I have no idea about Men In Black films look like. So, no comparison. I could only write review based on this film.OK, when I decided to watch this one, I didn't have any high hope. I saw the poster was kind of good, so, I thought that the film would be a fine one too. Hence, I watched it.When I saw Liam Nesson was in the film, I was surprised. Mainly because I always watch his films and I've totally missed this one. Maybe because I haven't checked out his films recently. And when I saw Chris Hemsworth was in it too, I was surprised too. I saw his Thor films and never seen any other films. But to be honest, I didn't like his character in this film. It's like he thinks he's better than anyone. And I hate those kinds of people. Also I don't like Molly too. Her character kind of disgusted me. No offence.The performances are basically fine, except for the actress who acted as Molly. I feel like her acting is terrible. The casting director should have chosen the other actress instead of her. The screenplay is fine too. Some scenes are funny and some are interesting.

97,kuarinofu,Remember Men in Black?,5,18 June 2019,"Ok, so 22 years ago Men in Black was out. It was a fun yet grounded sci-fi comedy with good relatable characters working great off each other, a simple story with good dialogues and interactions, a bunch of great ideas about space, discovery and the relativity of big and little things. Very simple, but effective. Surely it wasn't perfect, but one can still go re-watch it for the pure nostalgia, simple comedy, young Will Smith's charisma, simple practical effects, and a great soundtrack.
I really don't want to compare this to the first one, but MiB: International really tries to reinvent the first MiB movie. And it fails so hard. The story is incredibly unengaging, just so dull and uninteresting. No new big fresh ideas, no interesting discovery. Like come on, you have MiB on your hands, do something interesting with it.
The characters are totally unrelatable. Agent M is a Mary Sue, Rey from Star Wars, a perfect character that knows everything and can do anything she wants, without spending any time or effort to be this way. Agent H is pretty much Hemsworth playing his Kevin character from Ghostbusters 2016. Just a brainless handsome dude who provides some eye candy for the ladies. At first, I thought they are trying to pull off reverse sexism of some sort, but they dropped that off pretty fast. 1997 duo had chemistry because Jay was a young inexperienced yet extraordinary young man, while Kay was old, experienced and chill mentor-like character, they balanced each other perfectly. These new ones are pretty much the same one character, with no likable qualities whatsoever.
The world of the movie feels shallow and in no way it interacts with MiB themselves, it's just sets, locations. The first movie had a city full of secrets, aliens, and galaxies within. The world and the aliens reacted and interacted with MiB, they had their place in it. A role, an objective. They were the protectors. They were limited in number and thus much more identifiable. Here they just exist, more, they even have international offices, flooding the MiB with so many unnecessary characters and nicknames I wonder how they deal with that in terms of the alphabet (besides uppercase and lowercase).
It's overloaded with locations, it just feels blown up and all over the place, not as grounded as the previous one, yet they don't expand in other ways, they don't use space, time, anything.
There's a lot of action, but these days it's not easy to impress the audience with action scenes. They use a lot of CGI as well, and partially this ruins the atmosphere that could've been built with practical effects.
While not in action scenes, these characters talk. And it's cringy. Messy dialogue, awkward scenes of MiB superiors acting like little kids, lots of stupidity. I think I laughed once in the whole movie, but it's pretty much every man to his own taste.
It kind of gets slower and more boring closer to the end, and then just rushed straight to it. It ends so fast even the editing gets choppy.

The film has a great cast and that is never the issue, more the lack of villains or the twist that is obvious. Not the spinoff the franchise deserved and sadly this film failed. 2019 was a mixed bag for franchise continuations and many failed at the box office.

99,Neptune165,worst movie of 2019 so far,2,31 August 2019,"This movie was horrible, just horrible. I can't even begin to explain how horrible the horribleness of this so called movie is. It's so bad, it's so bad my mind exploded and came back together when Liam Neeson appeared.It was so horrible, not even somewhat enjoyable and not funny. This one is just super boring, & not funny at all. This was the worst movie. Ruined MIB for the generations to come. The problem with the movie is that they forgot what made original MIB movies good. The aliens weren't supposed to be out there in the public, not disguising themselves, because otherwise they would not be allowed to exist. This was a missed opportunity and I fear things aren't going to get better anytime with more MIB movies. It just serves no purpose. No story, nothing. The problem of this movie is that it doesn't feel like an MIB movie. Its concept is so run down already as well that it got to predictable. Plus there was no real threat. The script, writing, and dialog are utterly ridiculous. This movie wasn't the same as the previous 3. Doesn't have that men in black fun cool style. It's what makes these movies so loved. You'll never get anything as good as the first. It doesn't feel like it belongs to the series. this movie is just nothing compared. no story, no plot, just dress. a woman in suit and few blue shots and we have a movie.",Men in Black - International

The best new character is a sarcastic chess piece called 'Pawnie'.Feels like a mash up between Mission Impossible & Harry Potter with aliens that doesn't measure up to the original, not endearing and certainly not enduring.",Men in Black - International
101,Darkside-Reviewer,Pawn takes the show,6,22 July 2019,While not as good as the original MIB movie this is definitely the best sequel so far with great casting fun characters and better comedy all round only downside is the over the top action scenes.The movie follows Agent M (Tessa Thompson) as she is taken on by MIB as a probationary agent after being assigned to the London Branch of MIB she charms her way into working a mission with the heroic world saving Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) who up until now has worked alone the two work a protection mission for a visiting Alien who is also royalty but after he is killed by assassins the two must become partners and figure out why he was killed and uncover a possible mole inside MIB.The movie is well shot and has decent effects that aren't to over the top the acting is very good from all involved a decent storyline if a little overdone but it works ok has good throwbacks to the original MIB and other nostalgic references most people will pick up on a little heavy on the action scenes but all round worth watching.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Comedy/Action movies that dont take themselves to seriously if you haven't seen any of the other MIB movies not to worry this movie is separate from them so no backstory to catch up on.,Men in Black - International

103,SoumikBanerjee25,Failed to Create the Same Impact as the Previous Ones.,5,10 September 2019,"Reboots are gradually becoming a norm today ; every time there's a news that some famous old movie or franchise is coming in a new shape and avatar. Though that thought might be tempting in it's own way which is BTW totally normal but Most of the time that new Reboot fails to leave a mark in the Favourites list as well as in audiences' minds. And the problem is in their roots ; the base to be more clear. They always try to imitate the old movie and it's success mantras. Hence the reboot forgets it's own existence and fails miserably to cope with the viewers demands.This film is nothing different. The makers tried to introduce Tessa Thompson's Agent 'M' character similarly to the Will Smith's character in the first MIB movie. Though she gave her best but she's no Will Smith. Meanwhile Chris Hemsworth brought the much needed charisma and screen presence on the screen but suffered with the hollow character he is being given. Liam Neeson too seemed generic. The story was bleak ; failed to capitalise on any front. The antagonist part didn't work out at all! And the way they introduced this Alien-Human coexisting world, felt weak and uninteresting at times.The only plus point of the film should be the CGI and modernistic technology that they have shown! Cinematography and Editing was just fine nothing extravagant there. Background score was just decent too. Nothing to complain or praise either!In the end, if you have been a Huge fan of the MIB franchise ; then don't watch it, as simple as that!

MIB:International is FAR worse than MIB 1, 2 and 3, and I just fail to see where their $110million budget went? The first 3 films were all directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, yet this 4th movie isn't directed by him... why? Barry Sonnenfeld has proved that he can make 3 good movies in a row, so why would you swap out to another director, who honestly has NEVER made a CGI-heavy sci-fi movie before? It just doesn't make sense... and this is what you're left with... a large blemish on the MIB franchise which can never be removed. And lastly: The entire 'suit up' scene with Tessa Thompson (Agent M) is an absolute cringe-fest... which director in their right mind would OK such a scene?",Men in Black - International
105,MrDHWong,A decent yet forgettable outing in this long running set of films.,6,13 June 2019,"Men in Black: International is the fourth entry in the Men In Black film series based on the series of comics of the same name. Directed by F. Gary Gray (Straight Outta Compton, The Fate of the Furious) and starring Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, it is a decent yet forgettable outing in this long running set of films.After stumbling across Men In Black headquarters in New York, Molly (Tessa Thompson) decides to join them in protecting the Earth from the scum of the universe. When it is believed that a mole has infiltrated the organisation, Molly, now known as Agent M, is partnered up with the sly and laid back Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) to find out who this mole could be before it is too late.While a marginal improvement over the second film in the series, Men In Black: International is but another mediocre sequel that leaves little impression on the viewer. The plot feels lazily cobbled together and it is executed poorly on screen. Director F. Gary Gray does not seem like the right choice to have helmed this film, as he stumbles at balancing the comedy and science fiction elements that have made previous entries so much fun. With that said, the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson is still undeniable, as was previously seen in Thor: Ragnarok. The quirky banter between the two of them prevents boredom in most scenes. but this is not nearly enough to warrant a recommendation outside of a viewing out of mere curiosity.I rate it 5.5/10",Men in Black - International
106,Alexander_Blanchett,MIB meets James Bond...,5,25 June 2019,"That was one major letdown. Now I was never a die hard fan of the Men in Black franchise but those films were fun. But now we know why they were fun because of the undenying dynamic of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones which this film was definitely and obviously lacking.
The result is a plotless and absolutely predictable SciFi James Bond Adventure. And in the end it is also extremely boring which is really surprising for such a kind of film.
Yes Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson have a great chemistry which is why they are currently often paired together in films but they both did not really fit the shoes of their precursors. Hemsworth tried his best to be the charming heartthrob and Tessa was trying hard to be funny and charimasti like Smith. Both failed. The saving grace was the animated character Pawny. Liam Neeson bored himself through the film I guess he just really enjoyed the paycheck for it. I loved Emma Thompson tho. She really tried her best, poor her. Rafe Spall was okay too. The animation was fine, the Alien characters of the past films had only cameos, which is a shame. All in all a film the world really did not need.",Men in Black - International

The story heavily retreads the first film and plays out as predictably as possible. This globe-trotting adventure is never really much fun and most of the humor falls flat. Hemsworth and Thompson have good chemistry, but you never really feel connected to either of their thinly drawn characters. Neither actor, though Hemsworth tries, really carries the charisma of Will Smith, the inevitable comparison in the film. Add in the PC pandering and you have a reboot that will very likely not see a sequel.",Men in Black - International
108,CANpatbuck3664,Gets the Job Done but it Could Have Been so Much More,7,2 July 2019,"Men In Black was once known for being a fresh and inventive franchise that launched careers and it redefined the science fiction/comedy genre. Unfortunately, the cumulative praise for the original has faded after the first sequel bombed and the second sequel (which I really enjoyed, I'm a defender of MIB 3, but I also concede the first half is admittedly slow and lacks funny jokes) performed adequately but not spectacularly. What this entry needed was a return to the fresh thinking of the first one, not the ideas or the formula. This movie was the definition of decent or good enough but I understand the leaked info from behind-the-scenes was coming from (which centred around the conflicting ideas for what the movie should be and reported fighting between the director F. Gary Gray and the producers), you can feel an edgier and sharper movie trying to claw its way out of the shadows. This franchise used to have so much imagination but between the alien design, the CGI effects and even the beats of the story, it feels like the creative team just lacked that spark. They needed to push the envelope more and they had the potential to do that with all the talented people involved, but a lot of the movie comes across as stale or just checking the boxes of what has to be included in an MIB film.One of the better parts of the movie is that it has a decent setup. We get to see how H and M arrived where they were and I thought their backstories were intriguing. It provided a good place for the movie to start from. H is the former golden boy whose fallen out of favour (though it is his fault) and M has been obsessed with aliens from childhood for a very personal reason. It helped provide solid motivations for their characters and the premise actually worked for me.We all remember the stellar chemistry that Hemsworth and Thompson had in Thor: Ragnarok and the hope was that some of the fun would carry over to MIB: International. Unfortunately, if I hadn't seen Thor 3, I would have just assumed they made for a very average pairing. Both of our leads are alright here, Hemsworth is effortlessly charming and that quality carries him through some of the rougher parts of H's dialogue and his character decisions. Thompson is a star on the rise, I've loved her in stuff like Westworld, Thor: Ragnarok, War on Everyone and even Sorry to Bother You. But she was pretty bland here, I'll punctuate that with the explanation that she was the victim of some inconsistent writing (Agent M's competence is all over the place and she's too much of a blank slate) but I was still disappointed. Liam Neeson is alright, he's watchable but he's doing Liam Neeson. Rafe Spall couldn't accomplish much as Agent C, H's stuffy office rival. Emma Thompson felt underutilized and the biggest letdown for me was Kumail Nanjiani as Pawnee. I had heard he was the best part of the movie going in but almost all his dialogue was bad and Nanjiani couldn't save it. He's a funny guy but I maybe got 1 solid laugh from his character. I would also extend kudos to Rebecca Ferguson who did what she could in her brief appearance, it was one of the better scenes in the movie for me.Just like any other comedy, I want to leave the theatre with some lines to quote and to laugh a couple of times while discussing it on the way back. MIB: International is intermittently funny but it's very hit or miss. The talented cast knows how to deliver the dialogue which definitely helps but you can only do so much with bad material. The story, dialogue, and character choices all had moments that briefly impressed me and those moments made me want to keep giving this movie room to work its way back in. But for every good moment, there's another that was yawn inducing or frustrating (the entire bit with Vungus just left me rolling my eyes). So while I did get a few laughs, there are funnier comedies out there to see.If I could sum this movie up in a word, it would be FINE. Its not a disaster or even that bad, its just alright and if you are interested in seeing it, I wouldn't try to dissuade you. There's enough here to recommend a viewing (you can wait for streaming media however) but it does make me sad that this is probably going to be the last we see of the MIB for a long time. The original MIB is still one of my favourite movies from my childhood but when you're out of ideas, its better to quit while you're ahead. Between the critical thrashing and the mediocre box office returns, its probably best for Sony to put this franchise back on the shelf for a while.",Men in Black - International

111,rdoubleoc,Great addition to the series.,9,23 August 2019,"I thought this was GREAT, and don't see much to criticize, but saw one review say how the special FX was great but the story wasn't, and I have to disagree since the special FX of the first three seem more high quality than this one, but it's been a while since I saw the first three. I think this has one of the best stories, though, and I like the whole girl and international ""spin"" they put on it. The first Men in Black film left me wanting it to be longer and not end, and that's kinda how this one felt -- wish it wouldn't end. If people criticize this movie, they don't know what a good movie really is.Tessa Thompson is a hottie, and has good chemistry on screen with Hemsworth. Wouldn't mind seeing them both again in any sequels (I felt like they should've made her character funnier, though, even though she was very likeable, like in the spaceship imitation part, and others). Neeson was a good temporary addition, too, and Emma Thompson needs to stay in any future sequels. She forever reminds me of Hillary Clinton (or just cast Hillary -- we won't even know!).Only thing it's missing is an up to date catchy theme song, but that's not a big deal. The content is where they should spend the most time/money anyway, and I think they did a good job.Sometimes I regret buying movies when they come out, but usually buy them if I can't rent it digitally yet, feel it'll be worth it, and because I don't really go to the threatre like my friends do. I don't regret buying this, though.MIB is more than just Will Smith and TLJ, and this movie was a great introduction to this idea, if they're going to continue it. I don't think even Hollywood knows how much we love MIB, and the only way to ruin the series is to make a bad or cheap sequel... so please don't, but keep the new ideas and spins coming.

121,PyroSikTh,Uninspired and Generic,6,18 June 2019,"Molly has a chance encounter with an alien as a kid, and witnesses the Men in Black neuralyze her parents. She spends the next twenty years trying to track the mysterious organisation down in order to join them, coming in top of her class at the FBI and the CIA while tracking unusual meteor activity in her spare time. Eventually she tracks them down and is allowed to just waltz in, where she manages to talk herself into being hired and is sent to London on her first assignment. From there we get a plot about a mole in the organisation, a mysterious item handed to Molly (now Agent M), and two cosmic-looking aliens coming after it. As general stories go it's uninspired. At least the other Men in Black movies tried to shake things up a little bit, had interesting twists and turns, and a menagerie of aliens to show off.That's what pretty much sums International up; it's uninspired. It coasts through the motions, delivering us a taste of what Men in Black used to be, without doubling down on that. I got a huge hit of nostalgia when the iconic theme kicked in at the beginning of the movie, but the rest of the soundtrack is generic and forgettable. The big twist at the end isn't so much of a twist as it is a confirmation of the most obvious answer. Who was the mole? Chances are it's the guy you thought it was all along. Red herrings are offered, but they're very obvious red herrings and aren't worth paying much attention to. Details are spoonfed to the audience, going over story points we've already seen for ourselves, or reiterating things that have already been said just to make sure we got it. A good drinking game would be to take shots every time someone mentions Agent H has changed. Problem is for the audience he doesn't seem to have changed at all, making their claims and concerns empty and meaningless.Visually the film isn't too bad, but it doesn't possibly lean on it's CGI a little too much. Of course Men in Black is a franchise that could go in some really cool ways thanks to the evolution of CGI over the years, but instead International sticks to the same aesthetic that could be done through costumes, make-up and puppetry, but generates it all in a computer instead, giving that unrealistic glean. The cosmic entities definitely needed that CGI treatment (you try doing miniature supernovas with practical effects), but the likes of Vungus and many of M's coworkers could very easily have been done practically. Furthermore every globetrotting setting feels like a soundstage, which kind of ruins the point. Why bother going all over the world when it all looks like the same place?But what I suspected before I even went in, and is unfortunately very true, is the gaping holes left by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. The franchise should have ended when they left. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson have proved they have really great chemistry together in Thor: Ragnarok, and you can tell the studio was banking on that to sell the movie. Yeah, they do still share a really good chemistry together, and play off each other really well. But they weren't J and K; the young meeting the old, the awestruck meeting the cynical. Instead it's the know-it-all meets the inept. Thompson makes it plainly obvious she is ill-suited to headline billing in a Hollywood blockbuster. I don't mind her as an actress, but here she came off as annoying. She couldn't hold the movie despite quite clearly being the main character. She flits between disinterested and desperate, and solves almost every problem single handedly. Hemsworth on the other hand is stuck with a character so useless it makes you wonder why he was being lauded as the best agent in the organisation. He does nothing the entire movie other than look attractive and deliver half-baked one-liners.Everyone else sort of lazes through their roles. Liam Neeson is barely convincing one way or the other, either as the nice guy he's portrayed, or the potential mole that is hinted. He holds no gravitas and just sort of bleeds into frame. Rafe Spall is the opposite, clearly more enthusiastic about being in another Hollywood movie, but he sells the potential mole angle of his character so well that he becomes an annoyance in Agent H's side constantly. When he shows his nice guy side it's heartless and feels out of character. Emma Thompson appears in a couple of glorified cameos, Rebecca Ferguson has a lot of fun with a role completely unsuited to her, Kayvan Novak (Fonejacker to you Brits) is horrifically underused, and the only actor of any real note is Kumail Nanjiani's voiceover work as Pawny, and only because he seems to get all the best jokes and one-liners. If I laughed during this movie, it was at Pawny.Okay so far this review has come off really negative, and for that I'm sorry, because it doesn't really demonstrate my views. Unfortunately the positives are so mundane and generic that they're barely worth mentioning. It is an enjoyable movie. You largely get everything you paid for; action scenes, imaginative aliens, a shadowy organisation in black suits. But ultimately this is all just safe, risk-free work. It checks all the right boxes at a bare minimum. By this point I actually think the proposed crossover movie with 21 Jump Street would have at least been a far more interesting experience to watch, as completely whacky and off-the-wall it sounds. At least it would've been trying something relatively new and different. Ultimately I give Men in Black: International an uninspiring 6/10.",Men in Black - International
122,ethanbresnett,A Pleasant Surprise!,7,6 May 2020,"I've got no real interest in the Men in Black franchise. The only reason I bothered watching this was because of the involvement of Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson (primarily the latter). Hemsworth proved with Ragnarok that he can handle a comedic script really well, and Tessa has smashed every role I've seen her in. The chemistry between the two of them in Ragnarok and Endgame was great, so these two were the main attraction for me. I'm incredibly pleased to say that they didn't disappoint in the slightest, exceeding my expectations in fact.The film had a shaky 15 minute opening where I wasn't quite sure, but everything that followed was such great fun. Yes, the plot wasn't anything particularly mind blowing and the final 'twist' was a little predictable, but it was a solid and well paced story. The action was pretty slick and always entertaining, and the effects were good for the most part.As mentioned earlier, the real charm of this film comes from the cast. Tessa and Chris have such great chemistry on screen and always injected humour and energy into their scenes. I got the impression that they were having a good time making this film which always makes it a slightly more enjoyable watch. The characters were fun and it was a good ride watching them get up to their hijinks. The addition of Kumail Nanjiani was inspired, and his interactions with the other two made for some great comedy.Speaking of the comedy, I was very surprised - this is a funny film! I was expecting a lot of cringe/goofy humour (which there was a little of) but there are some real laughs to be had here, particularly with the more adult humour. The script was quite sharp and witty in places, excellently delivered by the cast. It was constantly entertaining and brought out some real laughs. The main takeaway from this is that we need Hemsworth doing more comedy.There really isn't much to complain about with this film. Its a good laugh, nice and light hearted and thoroughly entertaining.

Aside from the nostalgia, I do not think there was much value to the film. Rafe Spall and Liam Neeson were so bland in this movie.

126,BrnzReviews,As Far As Sequels Go.. I Was Entertained!,8,30 May 2021,"This franchise is a breath of fresh air, it truly feels like going in a time machine back to the days where men in Black on the VHS was the one, I love the way they tell their stories its very entertaining. As far as sequels go this caught me off guard, I was expecting this to be a typical remake that is until I saw this cast.Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, both who have worked together in Thor and were great so the chemistry is definately there. I'm a big fan of Chris Hemsworth so I had a strong feeling this wass going to go beyond jokes and no bade of story, through story was there and it was a very entertaining movie to experience.The absence of J & K is a shame but I think it would take the feel of this movie away if the originals were in it, maybe a cameo would of been good but I feel like it may have ruined the classics. A great watch in my opinion all the same i think its worth every minute spent.Highly recommend this movie, entertaining and hilarious!",Men in Black - International
127,Magow-Intermean,Men In Black International Review,8,15 June 2019,"Men in Black (MIB) goes international as the secret agency continues to protect the world from intergalactic threats, with Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) and recruit M (Tessa Thompson) leading the charge.Molly (Tessa Thompson) encounters the MIB as a young girl and becomes obsessed with finding the secret organisation. She's written off as crazy for believing in aliens, but her persistence leads her to the doorstep of the US headquarters. Impressed by her tenacity, department head Agent O (Emma Thompson) gives Molly a chance to prove herself, dubbing her Agent M, and putting her on probation. M is packed off to London, where she meets the heroic Agent H, who saved the world along with the London head High T (Liam Neeson) using only their wits. Agents H & M are assigned a seemingly low-key mission, but everything goes haywire, leaving the fate of the planet in their hands.While this plot sounds pretty much like every other MIB film so far, this continuation of the franchise appeared to be a lot more promising with the charismatic and currently popular Chris Hemsworth, paired with the equally affable Tessa Thompson. The actors have previously worked together with impressive results. Director F. Gary Gray aims to capture their lightning chemistry in this film but instead ends up proving that no amount of charisma can substitute a strong screenplay. 'MIB International' meanders along the way to set up the plot, and all the wisecracks (few of which land), special effects (nothing that we haven't seen already), or fancy aliens (same as before) can't seem to salvage it. All isn't lost; the one character who stands out is Pawny, voiced by Kumail Nanjiani. His thumb sized alien somehow gets the best lines, and therefore, the best laughs. Should there be a sequel, his backstory might be worth looking into.
Other than that, there's not much to savour here. The villains are bland, and although some of them have pretty cool powers, their motivations are as derivative as their personalities. There is intrigue around the relationship between Riza (Rebecca Ferguson) and Agent H, but it is barely explored. An obligatory twist towards the climax has a storytelling element that holds promise. Sadly, it comes a little too late in the proceedings. Despite all its shortcomings, Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson fans may be able to sit this through, simply because their screen presence is so magnetic and charming. Pity they're working with such a bland script, ending in a film that seems to cater to new audiences, rather than those who grew up watching the edgier MIB movies before it.",Men in Black - International
128,thomasjay-2201,Don't believe the Headlines,6,18 June 2019,"Straight to the point: I enjoyed this, as a film and part of a wider franchise it stands well on its own two feet and can very easily be enjoyed with both no and full prior knowledge of the 'Men in Black' world. Frankly I can't really understand the distaste. Having rewatched the first 2 instalments of the franchise recently as various TV networks aired them in advance of release of International it's fair to say that Hemsworth and Thompson don't really come anywhere near the previous duo of Lee Jones and Smith but like the film work well together, as you'd expect with their track record over 2 or 3 Marvel films together. Apparently suffering with creative differences what Gray and the studio ultimately churned out is solid, slightly more family than the original duology of films which have always appeared to me to posses a gritty and bleak edge to them the more ""PG"" approach was welcoming and fit well. The new Will Smith, Tessa Thompson rises to the occasion and plays the lead role quite well though frankly does at times get knocked down the pecking order for Hemsworth who's easily the more marketable of the 2 currently. Ensemble figures and supporting cast are also quite strong with Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson and Rafe Spall in particular providing memorable characters that when looking back over the series will be notable. Visual effects on the most part are a bit iffy, barring Pawny everything seems too polished which did at times drag me from the experience and was certainly something that couldn't be said about the original films which had an unpolished and almost grimy look likely reason for their cult status. Plot wise things move at a breakneck speed chucking various phases of character development to what felt like a montage of half an hour really rushing to get to a point where things can truly progress which and testament to the film was quite successful. There's a few good debates about 'attachment issues' to the title and the exclusivity of the name and even the odd dig at controversial figures which are likely to get a laugh from the older audiences, setting up and executing different character decoys and throwing multiple twists at the audience everything more or less seamlessly wraps up with a slight hint at a romance and definite sequels. On the whole a fairly enjoyable experience that's action packed and fairly family friendly, Id highly recommend",Men in Black - International
129,SnobReviews,"""MIB: International"" is lacking in most areas.",4,13 June 2019,"#MIBInternational doesn't necessarily offer anything new and is far too predictable. A spin-off or ""sequel"" that didn't have to be made.In this sci-fi comedy, the MIB organization tries to find a mole amongst them which proves to be their toughest assignment yet.Here's the thing, ""MIB: International"" lacks action, originality and a decent enough plot to get by. The original films that I grew up watching had those factors and more. Yes, Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") and Tessa Thompson (""Thor: Ragnarok"") do compliment each other, but let's face it, they're no Tommy Lee Jones or Will Smith combo. I also found the laughs were lacking, which thankfully Kumail Nanjiani (""The Big Sick"") steps in as an alien for some comic relief. When scenes were supposed to be funny, they were not. A lot of it felt forced. This new film is entertaining in the latter part but overall it's a miss and I was disappointed.Wait to see it at home.

For the rest, at least for me, this was not a MiB movie. I have grown up with this franchise and for me Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones will always be the real and only MiB. I understand that Hollywood need to squeeze some franchises to have a sure income, but this hurts a little bit. Actors does not have the same charisma, and there is definetely something off. Even the main villain is not so convincing and it feels like that all the actors (human or aliens) does not have the same personality as the original movies.

132,DuskShadow,Hemsworths betraying portrayal ruins another Franchise. Women of course blameless...,4,8 November 2019,"""Men are bad, and women are good."" Nyaaaah... Seriously?
FFs this is almost an exact repeat of the recent Ghostbusters reboot, and I kinda found that one funny.
So here we again, in yet another franchise, stuck with Hemsworth being the epitomy of the dumb, useless male stereotype for the female gender to harp upon and use as the unofficial mascot for the rest of our actually noble masculine gender. What a joke this film was, like every other conversation or scene needed that crud? IF the role had been reversed, feminists would have been marching and blowing up twitter and other social media sites like there was no tomorrow.
Aside from the fact that MIB did not bring back Will SMith because he himself was busy ruining another well loved franchise * coughs Aladdin*, this movie was just one big egotripping femininst assault upon men, poorly veiled as comedy. And I just dont get how this was okay. I get the way modern ""culture"" is and tends to lean, as if nobody can actually tell the truth for fear nobody will be able to get laid and the species may well go extinct if women are not just exalted and pampered egotistically whenever possible.
But the alternative is a movie like this new, horrendous MIB? Bring on the end times I say, at least there would be no more terrible flops heaped upon us by an ever maddened Hollywood.
All the men fighting amongst themselves, the random female MIB head in America that just had the smallest bit role, but took another young up and coming gal into the fold on nothing but...what...PLUCK? And this random chick just happens to be a practical weapons master, ultra great at alien languages, and discrete operations. Yet she COULD NOT EVEN SNEAK INTO MIB HQ? A wig wearing alien mobster ""queen"", a term that was painfully anticipated and used exactly as I feared in a scene where the literal male
""pawn"", honorable, loyal, and bereft of purpose, settled for serving a chick he has no connection with... * gags *
I am glad I do not have a daughter, because its this kind of tripe that is rotting the brains and souls of modern females with no redeeming qualities. I would honestly prefer a sequel to that crummy Tomb Raider film over what has become of MIB, because at least Tomb Raider kinda tried to instill self sufficience and survival in the minds of young women, even if impractically done in a too obvious hollywood format...oh and its not just MEN, in black, as the characters pointed out. Cause the female agents present were not already obvious? *smfh * I now have a headache from watching this flick.

starring: Chris Hemsworth,Tessa Thompson,Emma Thompson,Liam Neeson,Kumal nanjiani,Rebecca Ferguson and Rafe Spall etcoverall rating 49/100
Men in black international was just average. With some strengths but more weaknesses lets talk about why this is.First the film had excellent world building and visuals. The film did a good job with expanding the world that we know and love in the men in black. I enjoyed all the new character designs for all the new aliens and the whole international idea. It was also nice to see some of the aliens from the original ( in my opinion better) franchise as it bought back a lot of nostalgia. Also the visuals were admittedly great with showing off all the tech and powers of the different aliens despite admittedly being fairly safe with the visual creativity until the final act.Next one of my favourite parts of the film would be Kunal Nunjiari as pawny. He stole so many scenes with his relatable humour and one liners and bought the admittedly very limited humour to the film. Him and his relationship with Tessa Thompson/agent M was very fun and entertaining.However further developing the humour in the previous paragraph most of the attempted humour within the film fell very flat in my opinion. The film was trying so hard to be funny it was just very awkward that i hardly laughed throughout the whole film and neither did my audience watching the film either. I think if a films main aim is to be funny but then it falls flat it leaves you a bit deflated and disappointed.Next the film also added pretty much nothing to the world of men in black. The film just did not have enough creativity or originality. It just felt like a poorly done re imagining of the original. There was to much recycled content from the past films therefore leaving me wondering why it was even made in the first place if they are not going to be creatively better and more impressive then the originals.Next the film had major pacing issues. The whole film felt incredibly rushed in my opinion. They did not allow any scene to settle for any longer then a few seconds so therefore i felt slightly disconnected from the film. The editing did not help either as it felt to choppy which was very distracting to see.Next the film had a very intriguing mystery that kept me mostly interested throughout the film. The plot despite being generic still got me guessing and actively thinking about who the traitor in MIB was and what the main weapon was despite the results of these being predictable i still had a mostly fun time figuring out these parts of the plot.Next i thought the film personally for me was a bit to OTT with its feminism message. To have the woman in black which does not even have a ring to it mention so many times throughout the film just for a feminst message really bored me. I support feminism for sure but it is getting a but to shoved down everyones throats especially in blockbusters such as avengers endgame and Aladdin.However next is my final two main positives that in my opinion kept the film from being a total disaster. The action sequences were very inventive and entertaining in a fair few parts of the film. The villains despite being bland did have interesting powers in the way they killed people. and the final act was very entertaining with the hive leader. The main scene stealer in terms of action for me would be the introduction of Rebecca Fergusons character Riza. Her having 4 arms really led to a very entertaining action sequence with her and agent M and kept me constantly interested and entertained throughout its just a shame this did not last. And finally Tessa Thompson was a fantastic lead within the film. Her character was extremely likeable and relatable to the audience which makes you really connect to her character so unlike Chris Hemsworth character F gary grey did a great job with Tessa Thompson and she also stepped up to the plate and delivered an excellent acting performance.However i unfortunately have to end on my final two negatives. Firstly the films villians were bland and terrible. They hardly spoke,the director decided to make them dancers for some stupid reason and there was never enough detail or explanation into there actions so i just eventually ended up getting bored of them. every time they showed up. And finally the film was just so predictable and generic. I figures out the mole in MIB and the plot twist within half an hour of the film so when it was finally revealed it did not surprise or give me excitement to see the final act. And the film just had generic villains,mostly generic action and generic and weak humour.Overall Men in black international frustrated me at how average it was due to the amazing performance from Tessa Thompson and Pawny. But it was narratively weak and generic. And the humour just fell flat for me and really made me wonder why this was even created in the first place.",Men in Black - International
136,shanayneigh,This should never have been a franchise,2,12 June 2021,"The first movie was good and felt fresh. None of the sequels have been good, including this fourth movie.The story is gossamer thin, as are the characters. Very lazy writing. The main character doesn't make much sense. She's a rookie who is welcomed into the agency in the dumbest way possible, yet she's also an expert in seemingly anything the script calls for. Critics have hailed the alleged chemistry between Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth, but I honestly have no idea what they're talking about. Then again, there's a black female lead, so I guess they have to come up with something positive about her. Thompson proved in Thor Ragnarok (and in interviews) that she has zero comedic timing, and that hasn't changed. Hemsworth is mugging for the camera any chance he gets. Emma Thompson, who is prominently displayed on the poster is in a scene or two, with perhaps three minutes of screen time. Stunt casting. Liam Neeson is picking up a pay check, no more, no less.I wasn't expecting a good movie, and it didn't prove me wrong.",Men in Black - International
137,thebricks,Tessa Thompson shines in this; Hemsworth is beyond terrible,1,6 August 2019,"I've been a big fan of Tessa Thompson since Thor Ragnarok. I thought it wasn't a good movie but I really liked her performance. Watching MIB: International, I realize finally that Chris Hemsworth is the real problem. He can't act. I think like Idris Elba, the potential is there but they've reached a certain level and just don't feel they need to take it seriously at all. I was thinking that if at some point, Hemsworth's character just disappeared, Thompson could have carried the movie and it would have improved.Another issue with the film is just Sony's sterile production values. I don't know what it is, but something is off with their films. I want to say that everything feels color by numbers and soulless. They're cheaping out on something but I can't put my finger on it. Maybe everything is green screened like crazy and actors don't know what is around them, so their reactions are off.This movie really does fall under the category of ""Average Fanboy Could Have Made a Much Better Movie."" The MIB franchise is such a great universe, why has only ONE of the installments been any good? Seriously. Maybe it's time for a creative reboot, I don't know. Keep Tessa Thompson, send Hemsworth packing. Maybe it's time to recast Thor as well. With a man! I feel terrible having to say that these days too because the ""woke"" stuff has gotten ridiculous.Not even worth your time, TBH.",Men in Black - International
138,kermitkid,"Bit familiar, but picks up in second half",8,30 March 2020,"I said in my ""Ghostbusters"" (2016) review that Chris Hemsworth was the best part of the film because of his hamminess. The same is true of his performance in this film. He's not as ditsy in this as he was in that, but more from the comedic side. He's like a fusion of his character from ""Ghostbusters"" and Thor in ""Thor: Ragnarok."" He is so fun in this movie! Liam Neeson's performance is also standout, but I won't dare tell you who he is, because it's a huge spoiler. This plot was the most engaging of all the ""Men in Black"" films. As classic as the 1997 movie is, it's very dated. This had a fresher plot, and it managed to still mix some familiarity of the old ones into this one, though for the first 3rd, it's a little too familiar, and feels like a retread of the first one. The character of Pawny is one of the funniest characters in this film. He plays the role that the pug Frank did in the other films, but unlike Frank, he's actually funny. This is the most entertaining film in the franchise. The action is better, the plot is the best of all of them, and the performances are standout.

140,movieman6-413-929510,This spin-off is more fun for people who are not so familiar with the original trilogy.,4,18 June 2019,"Men in Black: International is a spin-off from the Men in Black trilogy. This spin-off is directed by F. Gary Gray, director of The Italian Job, Straight Outta Compton and Fast & Furious 8.At a young age, Molly (Tessa Thompson) experienced the work of the secret organization the Men in Black. Nobody believes her stories about what she has seen and therefore goes in search of the secret organization.
When she finally finds the organization, she is quickly hired by the organization as an agent under the code name M. M thus becomes the new partner of agent H (Chris Hemsworth). Together they must take on aliens who can change shape. If one of these creatures knows how to infiltrate the Men in Black, H and M cannot trust anyone anymore and they have to single-handedly stop the creatures to keep the earth safe and protected from these dangerous aliens.Compared to the original film and the other two films of this trilogy, this film is a bit less or just about the same level as the second Men in Black film. If you are not that familiar or grew up with the Men n Black films, you can probably enjoy this film more. For a better film you can simply watch the original film from 1997 better.
The original trilogy is also completely directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. Despite the difference between the three films, he managed to create a kind of equal atmosphere in the films. With the new director F. Gary Gray, the spin-off takes place at a different location and thus also has a different atmosphere compared to the three previous filmsThe comedy level also seems to be lower compared to the comedy from the previous trilogy. This is due to the predictable script that most comic moments give away before they are really shown to you as a viewer. Chris Hemsworth often manages to convey his roles in a comic way, which he is able to do with this film, but compared to the comedy that Will Smith managed to bring with his role in the trilogy, this comedy is a bit disappointing. Kumail Nanjiani also does some comedy work like the alien creature Pawny, but this comedy seems to mean more to younger viewers.The effects also look a little less compared to the original trilogy. With many aliens you can see that they were placed in the film with CGI. Many of these aliens also do little more than to be present in the background. The hostile form of changing aliens also take on a human form, which makes them appear simple and cheap.The acting is well done by Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson in the lead roles. Together they have good chemistry, but it was better in Thor Ragnarok. Larger stars such as Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson have a nice cameo in this film, but they also do nothing special in this short time. Rebecca Ferguson doesn't have much to do with the other villains in the film. With the changing beings you can often predict what form they have taken. Rebecca Ferguson is unfortunately also put in a stupid costume in this film, which makes it somewhat difficult to take seriously.",Men in Black - International

But this basically is at odds with just working on things because things don't get done on their own. So play? Or work? What's the correlation by dammit: it's just what unrolls itself to you like a carpet. H is played by this delightful chap who's in those Marvel movies, because he is this nonstop delightful person throughout. The movie goes to lengths for him utilizing a humor to drive the movie along into entertainment. Prior there were some trailers for other movies, Terminator showing beardy Arnold opening the door as if it's just him opening the door actually to his place. But looks dope. Another Spiderman with him just talking friendly with the villain(?). The next trailer is the guard guy protecting the dopey Prez who goes ""(whiny)Uhhhhhuh (dopey)idk whats going on"" series which looks like a video game with all these drones exploding and security being a total embarrassment once more that he has to be this super agent, also ft. Nick Nolte appearing purposely in the woods with proximity mines, looking like unmasked Jason from Friday the 13th Part II.Anyway this flick has lots of things out of nowhere seemingly. A sentence given is ""have you ever abanonded logic for passion"" is compelling. WHOA. There's this scene where they keep detaching all this crazy looking silvery weaponry from parts of their car blowing away the badguys and it's like from a video game as they get a diff gun and just stand around letting loose more blasts while the badguys are further down the street standing around conveniently and we get to check out different blasts but at least the audience can be dumbly dazzled by all these effects, Yawn. But forget all those artsy 'seat of despair cineasts', just lay back and enjoy it like a dumb**** yokel.Another wise sentence is how M says passion is just a ""chemical reaction"" and wants to just be logical while H responds that the universe is a chemical reaction. Damn. This is like the arguments between McCoy and Spock in Trek while Kirk just is amused by their feud. Towards the end there's the switcheroo tactic of narrative of who you think is not so etc which seems kinda like a used up tactic but hey yaknow it's like whatever at that point if you get up to that point in the movie by then you're already made up your mind what you think of it. Why do I rate this so is because I am not offended by anything in the movie, there's a lot of dumb fun but at this point it's just better than like loads of duller movies, also never into this series' other movies because I didnt care for those leads, be honest does anyone? aside from their box-office to groupthink you into believing that? But here the leads are manageable. Someone says 'the universe has a way to lead you to where you need to be', another quote for the textbooks. My mom remarks that a lot of the plot is kind of a mess to keep up with and I agree with this remark. THIS is a dumb as heck movie, and I enjoy it not giving an iota if things make sense but just getting things from point A to point B and they even have the characters mention how they enjoyed riffing off each other, that's probably what they just figured to do to make it entertaining for the movie itself.",Men in Black - International

Overall I really like the world building and aesthetic of the MIB films and this was a continuation of that, bringing us more over the top aliens and 'space guns'. These three characters are really the ones that carry the movie, of course the supporting Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson also do a good job.The biggest issue of the movie is with its villain plot and its overall story, there is a twist in the movie that can be seen miles away and is just the same old story that has been told time and time again in spy films. The 'villains' of this movie, the alien twins were very bland and not well developed, in fact most of the time they simply appear as a blob of 'space glowing stuff'.

151,jamesjustice-92,MIB gets international,9,12 June 2019,"As soon as I found out there would be no Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in the movie I got worried but having watched the trailer made me realize there was nothing to be afraid of: the franchise simply wanted to extend and expand its own universe beyond these two great characters and show us that there are many more people behind the MIB name and same kind of organizations all over the world. MIB International is a worthy successor, a bit too polished, try-too-hard-to-be-funny and predictable but still a great one to watch and rewatch, just like the previous parts. Visuals are stunning, great new score by Danny Elfman with the hints of the same great old tunes is superb, tons of really witty jokes, good acting and overall a very fine nostalgic atmosphere. I enjoyed every minute of it.",Men in Black - International

155,daniewhite-1,Muddled and Bland: Interminable,3,8 September 2021,"A film like 'Men in Black: International' needs really good writing or genuinely personable and charismatic stars. Preferably both. This hasn't. The writing is dreadful and the cast give bland and bored performances befitting their anemic characters and story and the two lead stars are easily outperformed by the uneven special effects.I don't blame the actors, even the lifeless leads, it seems that the writing, the director, the producers and the editor are the culprits to me. Probably the issue is the script: a sequel/reboot made so long after a franchise has petered out really needed a plot and set pieces to stand out. This has a dreadful muddle of a plot and action set pieces of mind numbing boredom plus special effects of uneven design and very uneven execution, I will say however that I never detected a moment where I thought that the director had managed to add anything to the composition of a scene or to an actor's performance.Overall I would have to say that this is a stinker. It does get a handful of stars from me though because two jokes registered, very slightly, and a couple, just a couple, of alien effects were engaging.Overall boring and bland film production design also hindered the effort, a bland score, boring sound design, and very ugly photography also afflicted my enjoyment: simply put I have never seen the actors in this cast looking so immediately and deeply ugly on screen.I rate a 3/10 and I don't recommend to anyone really. There are a couple of moments in the mix that are slightly better than the rest but, in my opinion, it's probably a film to watch while you are sleeping if you must put it on.",Men in Black - International

The casting is dreadful, the characters are weak and uninteresting the plot is garbage, even the special effects look dated and weak.. It feels like a movie that was made with a ""That'll do""
Attitude. The first 3 movies only worked because of the chemistry between Smith and Tommy. This rivals ghost busters in being a quick thoughtless cash-grab. May the title rest in peace.",Men in Black - International
157,Lewis_Heather787,A little shocked at the amount of hate !,7,16 June 2019,"Its it just me but has this film been over-criticised? Like don't get me wrong its nothing mind-blowing in general but personally I thought it was good entertainment. Maybe the ""Men in Black"" franchise is held up in some high regard by people, it isn't by me, none of the films have been groundbreaking for cinema. I thought they were just summer popcorn blockbuster material...... and thats exactly what this is.For me the first ""Men in Black"" is good.......the second, lets not talk about that.......finally the third instalment, I really have a soft spot for and really enjoy it...... might be my favourite.The two main draws for me were the performances and the story. The performances across the board are all really good, especially considering that Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth are stepping into Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones's shoes...I think they did are really good job considering. Their chemistry on screen was fantastic, straight away when they meet from the first time, however more importantly their dynamic changes throughout the film...there is a real arc. Emma Thompson is usually good quality and its good seeing her again, other big shoutout should go to Liam Neeson who again is great. One that surprised me was the fact that Rebecca Ferguson was in the film....I had no idea....she was also good in her brief role. So from my point of view from a performances standpoint there was no glaring error of miss-casting.The story is interesting-ish, although saying that compared to the other films I can understand why some people would find it boring, bland or uninteresting. However it was still ok to me, had a few laughs here and there not as many as we are use to in these films. The twists in the film were good and I personally didn't see them coming, Liam Neeson being the main villain.....and Chris Hemsworth had been neuralyzed.....some good twists that worked for me.Overall its 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its good light entertainment, popcorn blockbuster. Is it anything mind-blowing? No. Is its terrible? No. So I am extremely surprised at the hate that this film is receiving because I thought it was fine nothing great or terrible about it. Maybe people hold theses films up in high regard than I do but it did exactly what I thought it was going to do. Trying to be different and fresh in the franchise whilst still giving us some nostalgia along the way.",Men in Black - International

160,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Fun but Dumb,6,16 June 2019,"It's just about what I expected it to be. Does it have the magic of the first one? No, but neither did the other 2 sequels and for what its worth I enjoyed it more than the last installment. It does have plenty of funny moments. Theres a couple of jokes that dont really land/feel a little forced though. Tessa and Chris obviously work well off each other but you probably already knew that going in if you've seen Thor :Ragnarok. I did like the idea of MIB being compromised and their being a mole in the midst. It felt like a refreshing twist instead of it solely being another ""destroy the world"" narrative. I can't say it was executed perfectly as it seemed pretty obvious to me early on who actually was the villain. There was another particularly dumb moment for me where Agent M is taking a train to London. And we see this completely ordinary looking subway train transform into this high-tech high speed train. And I totally get that we are supposed to be living vicariously through Agent M and experiencing the wonderment with her....but what actual purpose does this serve in their world? Its only accessed by other MIB & Aliens. What is the purpose of disguising it like a regular subway train except to give us the audience something cool to look at. The character Pawny (Kumail Nanjiani) did have a few funny lines but mostly I felt he didnt really need to be there. It seemed like he was added to mainly sell some toys to kids.I know this makes it sound like I hated the film but I really didnt. Maybe it's because I didnt go in with huge expectations. But as I said before I did like some of the themes even if they werent executed to the best of their potential. It was funny and fun and just a good brainless film to watch.",Men in Black - International

He actually screened his project's before green lighting them, not let the studio have fun and make a total flop that has NONE of the original spirit, comedy, or even pacing for that matter of any of the previous films. The first 25 minutes will feel like hours with how slow this film runs, and the writer's and director's hold your hand the whole time while they walk with the speed of dripping molasses from a 10 story building, with jokes that miss, a story that is borderline G movie simple, and actor's who try, but with a script this bad, fail miserably. Don't waste your time if your a fan of the first 3 films and do us all a favour and drop this from the cannon.",Men in Black - International
162,AdrenalinDragon,Please erase my memory of seeing this movie,5,14 June 2019,"My initial expectations for Men in Black: International were positive, thinking that the Men in Black franchise could work without Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones being in the spotlight. Unfortunately, this did not prove to work with this movie. Chris Hemsworth can be a funny actor, but his schtick of acting like his Thor self here as a Men in Black agent falls flat and just feels awkward and misplaced. His partner character played by Tessa Thompson doesn't gel well here and she's fairly bland as a character, which is a problem since the original Men in Black movies relies on the chemistry of both agents. Because of this there are long awkward moments of silence and nothingness between both of them, and you're left waiting for when the next laugh will happen which is bad for Men in Black.The plot itself is not all that interesting and plays by the numbers for the most part. The alien gags are much weaker and the witty dialogue is almost non-existent. The supporting characters and the villain are very bland and uninteresting. All the Men in Black charm seems to have gone and now relies very heavily on CGI. Sure, the original Men in Black movies still had CGI, but there was a good chunk of practical effects in there too, which still look pretty good considering how old the other movies are. The musical score is decent, but that's because it's pretty much most of the old Men in Black music. There's some nice callbacks and references to the other movies here and there, but it's mostly filler and can end up reminding you of things done better in the previous movies.Perhaps my biggest issue with Men in Black: International is simply that it's not all that funny. Say what you want about the previous Men in Black sequels, but they do have moments that make you laugh and can be remembered. This Men in Black movie honestly I'm struggling to already remember parts of it. It's a mediocre/watchable movie at best, but not really one you would want to revisit. Maybe it's more of the script that's the issue rather than the actors/characters themselves, but Men in Black: International has not given me any hopes for the future of this franchise. Perhaps I'd be better off pretending I never saw it.4.5/10",Men in Black - International

The problem is that, even more than the wonderful creativity, this series was sustained by terrific and very endearing humour.

169,RhapsodyReviews,Kill This Franchise.,3,5 January 2020,"Review:
'Men in Black: International' is a science fiction-action-comedy film directed by F. Gary Gray. It is a spin-off of the 'Men in Black' film series, which is loosely based on the Malibu/Marvel comic book series of the same name by Lowell Cunningham.
A 'Men in Black' movie with a big cast and F. Gary Gray is the director. What could possibly go wrong? Apparently, everything, because this film is bad.
The Men in Black have always protected the Earth from the scum of the universe. In this new adventure, they tackle their biggest threat to date: a mole in the Men in Black organization.
Straight out of 'Thor: Ragnarok' Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson sign up for this movie. While they might have good on-screen chemistry, that doesn't mean they can play the characters well. Nothing about them shows MIB agents, at least not what I'm used to with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. Liam Neeson does a good job being himself in a black uniform but isn't on screen enough to give a good judgement. Same with Emma Thompson, she was added to the cast in the third film and she was a great addition, she wasn't well utilized in this film.
I didn't care about the story being told. It was boring and very sloppy with its forced humor and CGI filled action sequences. I see a lot of reviews getting angry at the bad reviews, saying since when is 'Men in Black' supposed to be an award-winning movie? It's about being fun and having a good time in the theatre. Yes, I agree. This movie doesn't make you have a good time at all.
Overall, I can't recommend this movie to anyone, let alone 'Men in Black' fans. If you like brainless action films that try and take itself too seriously, this film may peak your interests, not mine.

170,totalovrdose,An Idiotic Intergalactic Mess of Incredible Proportions,3,14 June 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed the original Men in Black. The cecond was okay, and the third I could have really done without. Now-a-days, I often expect a movie to fall under my expectations, though I will admit, I had begun to be reeled in by the marketing campaign behind MIB International, and had hoped it would be a decent enough flick - in short, it REALLY wasn't.I will admit, for the most part, the film looks breathtakingly beautiful (though one particularly Lovecraftian moment stood out obnoxiously like a sore thumb), and parts of the score gave me a tinge of melancholy. The film tries desperately to insert as much humour as possible, often resulting in jokes that continue long after someone ought to have shouted 'cut!', though some of the slapstick moments are bound to crack you up, along with some of the film's cuter segments.As for the 'woke' moments - these were to be anticipated, based on reports, and the few times they crop up, they are about as subtle as an atom bomb ('the men and women in black'; 'all women are queens'). These moments however, are not the film's issue. The severe lack of story, depth or intrigue is, coupled with the two dimensional archetypes (Liam Neeson with his stereotypical gruff manly voice is a fine example of this).The beautiful Tessa Thompson is Molly, or, as she later becomes known when she volunteers to be recruited into the organisation she has been pursuing for twenty something years, 'Agent M'. She has innumerable gifts; computer wizardry, close quarter fighting skills, unconventional firearm support, multilingual talents, and more - which is amazing considering the lack of any visible training or explanation (but you should get used to this because next to NOTHING in this flick is explained).Anyway, where was I? Right, Agent M is immediately assigned by agency head, Agent O (Emma Thompson), to investigate the London branch of MIB. Upon arrival, she is partnered with Agent H (the always entertaining Chris Hemsworth), whose charisma is not enough to save this movie, his character's unprofessional attitude making it hard to fathom how such an individual wandered into the good graces of such a secretive organisation.Not long into the movie, two alien twins are introduced, who are capable of manipulating the environment around them, who are supposedly the film's antagonists, as is some unknown nefarious force called 'The Hive'. I use the word 'supposedly' because neither villain is given any background, backstory or anything else, making it impossible for us to gauge the significance of the world ending (*yawn*) threats posed by these, umm, well, I don't know what they are...aliens?This is made all the more challenging to accept by the nonsensical jumps in the plot from one place to another. We are introduced to a variety of characters (Pawny, Riza, Vungus), all of whom are typically used as either a narrative or humorous device, and little more. In short, most of this could have been cut from the movie, and it would have still been perfectly nonsensical without them. Moreover, to add insult to injury, the film is generally predictable, though there was one particular saving grace that was revealed towards the end which I found interesting - for all of five seconds; after which the film forgot it had been mentioned.The final clanger, is Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones don't even have cameos. So, would I recommend this bomb? I would sooner recommend you put a red hot iron down your trousers. Watch with caution.",Men in Black - International

The first Men in Black was so great because it was so different than anything we'd seen and was a lot of fun, too. This one carries on the tradition, with some fresh air (female agents with authority), up-to-date in terms of a new generation's sensibilities, without being barfy (oh, *that's* so articulate ;> ), great visuals, some clever 'tricks', great aliens.

The plot just meanders and circles back on itself over and over, while the actually effective agent is reduced to a wibbling simp, apologising for doing all the work, while Agent Spunky contributes absolutely nothing and gets all the credit.I'll just repeat that for emphasis. While Agent Spunky is getting her sass on and declaring that she be a strong, independent wamen, fo' sure, not one thing that she does or one choice that she makes actually contributes to her job function.And then for the next hour we get a series of tiresome and largely unconnected vignettes that might have looked good on the storyboard, but which don't progress the actual story along beyond inexplicably focussing on and worshipping Agent Sassy for no reason that you'll be able to discern.There are no distinct acts that I can distinguish, no character development, nothing but ""Ha ha, Chad man is dumb, Agent Sassy is sassy"" until there are lots of explosions, and Agent Sassy saves the world, in ways that you'll be too bored and disinterested to even watch.What an absolute waste of talent, time and budget this is.",Men in Black - International

Fresh from kicking revenge dealt out to Thanos in AVENGERS: Infinity the duo are back on Earth teaching a lesson to the bad guys, the HIVE.The only truly negative thing I can say about this film is the fact that the behind the scenes Bloopers were not included in the end credits. I be the cast were absolutely creased over with laughing all the way through the film. The rest of the film was a total delight, with the minor yikes and error;s (such as continuity etc) being so trivial as to only be of interest to film buffs...like myself :)
The acting is spot on with lines delivered perfectly (and I would bet a good many of them would have been ad-lib occurrences) within a storyline that is perfect. Or maybe I should I say, Hilariously Perfect!If you think this is MIB number 4 in the franchise...its not..kind of...well it is a teeny weeny bit...oh dear its getting confusing. Let me explain. Yes this is film number 4 in the MIB universe. Yes its about men/women in black suits interacting with Alien refugees and some bad guys. But that's all they have in commons! Its so far removed from from the first 3 films (less serious, more comical...I bet the alleged 6 species of Aliens based here on Earth at AREA-51 were doubled up with fits of laughing) with incredible Alien species and objects in CGI ideas.
Whereas the first 3 were quite dark, straight-laced with some humour (the comical aspect being so dry it passed most people by without so much as a smile). I like both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones but they just can't deliver comedy lines and facial expressions in the manner needed...still enjoyed the films though! Chris and Tessa were a surprise to me in how they gelled like a tried and tested comedy and, Liam Neeson...WOW! I was already gobsmacked to see Liam in this kind of movie (well he's always a hands on, kick ass G-Man isn't he). His timing was impeccable and the look on his face at certain times had me grinning and hoping for end credit show of bloopers...which never came, Boo Hoo Hoo! You could just tell he was fighting with his inner self to not laugh!Anyway! In my conclusion I think that in these times of (1 track minded film studios, producers and directors) few and far between decent moneys-worth films I, got to see one of the better films of 2019. I have a colour code system in my database of entries for the films I have watched in any concurrent year. Colours Orange (good), Yellow (very good) and Green (Excellent), are scores above the 5 mark, with Light Blue (okay) Grey (poor) and Red (Absolute Rubbish) standing for under 5 scores.
So give it a viewing, have a good laugh (or not) and then make your own mind up about this Flick! Oh yeah...I nearly forgot. The real star of this film isn't Chris (Hemsworth), Tessa (Thompson) or even Liam (Neeson). Oh No, No, No! The real star of this Flick is an Alien character roughly 4 inches, about, 8-10cm tall alien bodyguard named, Pawny...you will love him!",Men in Black - International
187,DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,Absolutely Terrible 👽,2,22 April 2020,This is one of the most Tedious Movies I have Watched in a Cinema. Nothing about this Movie was Fun. It was So Boring.,Men in Black - International
188,droog-56936,Yuck!,3,22 August 2019,This absolutely awful piece of nonsense is another example of the sinking bubble Hollywood has become. Watching Tessa Thompson try and carry a movie is like throwing a block of wood across a room. Chris Hemsworth is true to form as the punching bag in the movie. Gross. Instead of changing the name of the Men In Black let's just change the actors.,Men in Black - International
189,samyoung-82648,"PC, bland and unpopular",5,14 June 2019,"First off, this movie is politically correct (you've been warned). For example, there's a spiel about ""people in black"" (you mean like ""girl power"", or is that different?). There's plenty of the usual ""reverse sexism"" (but let's just call it sexism for what it is). Hemsworth seems big on these type of movies.
Ok, this is the second ""girl power"" movie from Sony (after their Ghostbusters that the mainstream media loved but nobody else did). This time around, not even the media like this movie, despite the movie being politically correct.
The real issue is that the movie is too focussed on trying to be the first MiB, but failing because its too politically correct and too focussed on sfx, so, the actors take second fiddle to social agendas and green screens.
Sadly, despite solid acting chops from Hemsworth, Neeson and Emma Thompson, their performances are mediocre and the leading actress (Tessa Thompson) just doesn't have the chops to carry a movie like this (she's no Will Smith).
Summary: Not suitable for my children to watch (due to inconsistent and heavy focus on sex politics). Not worth watching because of the mediocre performances all around.",Men in Black - International
190,zenmateisshite,Disappointing,6,27 July 2019,"Like many reviews already said, this movie has so many stupid things, from the plot-holes to the editing to the total humor fails.At some point around 2/3rds of the way in and it came to me that it is called MIB International, as in multi ""nations"". An agency that deals with aliens from across the universe, concerning itself with the notion of a nation is just an indication of how stupid this installment of MIB is.",Men in Black - International

192,Fudge-3,Mostly OK,6,15 June 2019,"Ben in Black International has all the right elements for a great movie but the story is too rambling and the action too frantic. It's trying hard but like a junior orchestra playing Rachmaninov it hits a lot of wrong notes.The most interesting part of the movie, where agent M gets into the MiB, is cut short. The protagonists don't make sense. Some of the scene shifting is jarring. Sequences that should be funny are not.All the suits, the guns, the chases, the explosions, the cars and the rest of the special effects were great. The train was dumb but it looked good. Half the gags worked.In another movie franchise the leading characters here play as Thor and Valkyrie and they work well together. Sure enough at one point Agent H picks up a club hammer to use as a weapon but is the easiest gag in the world delivered? No. No, 'Shouldn't this be bigger?' No, 'This usually works better.' No, instead he says, 'Now you're in trouble,' which; like the rest of the movie, just misses the mark.I liked Emma Thompson. Whenever she was on screen it really picked up. We needed more of her.",Men in Black - International
193,theredsky,Men in Black: International Review,1,19 June 2019,"This film is complete garbage. There are only two aspects of the film that I found decent at best. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson have great chemistry together and Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thompson, and Liam Neeson do an okay job acting. That's where the positives stop. Here are the loads of negatives. The editing in this movie is awful. Scenes just abruptly end out of nowhere with no context. Some shots are shown multiple times in different angles and it is super annoying. Some shots make no sense. There is a desert scene and all of a sudden, it cuts to a picture of the moon for 3 seconds. There is literally no point to scene. The visual effects are bad. They are not complete garbage but they aren't good either. The aliens look extremely fake and it gets distracting sometimes. The original Men In Black movie may have some dated effects but most are better in that movie than in Men in Black: International. The characters suck. Liam Neeson is a terrible villain and his character has no motivation. He wants to take over the world just because. Both Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson's characters also don't have any motivation to do anything other than they are told to. The supporting characters suck. Rebecca Ferguson's character was only used for pointless action while the other supporting characters just suck in general. The film isn't funny at all. I didn't laugh at one joke. Each joke is painfully unfunny. The script sucks. Every line of dialogue feels forced and unnatural that you want to claw your hair out. The story and structure sucks. It tries to be this mystery movie but the film is so predictable that it loses any mystery. The film jumps from place to place with no rhyme or reason other than to move the story forward unnaturally. The tone is inconsistent. Some scenes are trying to be serious but are undercut by a comedic joke or some other conflicting tone. The pacing also sucks. Some scenes are so slow and others are just way too fast. Save your money and don't watch this garbage. Use that money to just rent the original film instead. Overall, Men in Black: International may have good chemistry between the lead actors but fails at recapturing the craziness of the original film. I give Men in Black: International a 1/10.",Men in Black - International
194,e-67102-48412,A funny comedy movie,8,10 May 2020,"If you forget Will Smith's Men in Black trilogy to enjoy this new Haizong film independently, there are indeed some baggage that will make people laugh. It can be said that it is a successful popcorn family movie. But it lacks some of the cult elements of the previous trilogy, and it feels a bit disappointing. Overall, home entertainment is good.",Men in Black - International
195,joshbarton15,Lacks any form of charm or charisma.,2,16 June 2019,"It's been seven years since Men in Black 3 closed out a trilogy of varying quality so I am quite surprised it has taken until now for Hollywood to try and get more money out of a flagging franchise. Men in Black: International treads familiar territory to its predecessors but with the duo of Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson at its disposal, a new dynamic has been called upon to drive it forward.Having faced many enemies from outer space, the Men in Black face their biggest threat to date: an enemy from within the organisation itself.It pains me to say that Men in Black: International is the least fun I've had in a cinema all year and, considering this is a very silly franchise featuring very likeable actors, I find it astonishing that a film as bad as this is the end product. You don't go into a Men in Black film expecting the best film ever however, you do expect to be entertained and there just wasn't anything here that set the film alight.Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson showed everyone they work well together before in Thor: Ragnarok but even they couldn't save this from becoming a complete and utter mess. The chemistry shows signs of working but then they're let down by an utterly abysmal screenplay full of questionable dialogue and inane jokes, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway the culprits in this case.The visual effects are undoubtedly impressive however, when they aren't applied to deserving sequences, it almost nullifies them totally. It just all feels very generic when there was a chance to create a whole new dynamic moving forward for the franchise.Men in Black: International proves that the majority of summer blockbusters care more about potential memes to be made than the actual quality of film provided to audiences. It's a film that's void of the charm and charisma that the Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones starring original was laced with. What a shame.",Men in Black - International
196,timeblank,Enjoyable but not Perfect,8,7 July 2019,"First off I am impressed with some of the villains in this movie especially the Les Twins. They were creepy and very intimidating. Also the mole agent in MIB played it great.Setting up, the build up, and execution was weak in the beginning of this film. Tessa Thompson character forcing her way into MIB, and makes the MIB secret organization looks dumb because they were supposed to be secret. Also the gambling scene with Chris Hemsworth didn't really make sense in Movie.Second half of this film I enjoyed. The story started getting interesting. The side character named Pawny was my favorite. Who knew that Liam Nesson was in here too.",Men in Black - International
197,maxmages,literally half-baked,2,13 September 2019,"This movie is one of the most boring and uninspired movies I have ever seen.
the movie has many problems. in the first place, it's boring, and many years later, it's too late. Thirdly, none of the actors make any effort to be complete and interested and not very awake, but the saddest thing is that nobody appears with real motivation or emotion. People want things but nothing has consequences. The villain is angry because he is a bad alien.And absolutely no one has any personal or emotional attachment to the main character and is not at stake, our protagonist is a Mary Sue character but written so shallow that you can not even get upset about her and most of the others.So, everything in this movie is just a big helping of nothing down there, unfortunately no one knows when is the right time to joke, for an emotional moment or to do something smart.

The only way I remembered was because of CinemaSins and because my parents will see any sort of crap that comes through Redbox.So, here is Men In Black International. AKA Men in Black 4. The poster of this movie just screams bad. It asks a serious question, what if Thor and Valkyrie were MIB agents? There's a joke gone bad. Besides that here's just one more joke I'm saying for humor. Why would Molly be an agent with Men in Black, it's not Women in Black! 😂Okay, back to the movie, it's not as well thought out as the previous three. Yes, I know the second one had sour moments, but it's more watchable than this because it explains how K got his memory back for the third film. Chris Hemsworth's character is this film is a sex object and Tessa Thompson's character is not as entertaining as Will Smith's Agent J. Wow. I even forgot Chris Hemsworth's characters name! No joke!I'm just going to stick with my MIB trilogy of the first three that I got from Best Buy for a really good deal. On the bright side. I can remember this movie now that I wrote a review.

Not even the constant change of locations helped. Made it look more desperate.Tessa Thompson's Mary Sue (M) character was just the worst. Can't make a dull character the crux of the new franchise.

There weapons and gadgets were over the top. The first MiB with Will Smith albeit fantasy, still had a believable essence to the movie, this one however did not.There were a few jokes, in movie funnies (Thor), and a few smirking scenes, but it's not the sort of movie you'd rush out to see again..in a hurry..or even in a few years.I thought it has killed the franchise of this movie, and should have been left alone. I think Liam Neeson and Chris Hemsworth are too big an actor to be killing time in this poorly scripted movie.",Men in Black - International
207,Brevin_Campbell,A pretty meh blockbuster,4,19 June 2019,"When going into Men In Black International I didn't have many expectations for the film. I had never really watched any of the Men In Black movies aside from the film halve of the first film. However I wanted to enjoy this film hoping it would reenergize the franchise and give us many more MIB movies. There was also the factor that the movie had Thor and Valkerie in it who had just made me laugh and chuckle a lot in Thor Ragnorok. So going in I was pretty interested in it. Of course the reviews were very poor, but I tried to stay stern. I still was going to see this film and judge it for myself.And I was very disappointed. I really tried my hardest to connect with the film on some emotional level, but that never came for me. I wanted to have fun with this movies, and for all intensive purposes it wasn't doing anything I hated. There wasn't anything about the structure that felt off and the jokes weren't bad. In fact a lot of them were funny. I especially loved the ""girl power"" line from Chris Hemsworth's character to Tessa Thompson's character. But at the end of the day I just didn't like this film.Tessa's character was probably the biggest issue I had with this movie. The movie was all about her, but I found that I just couldn't connect with her emotionally. She has a decent backstory, she has great lines, and how she get into MIB was solid, but even with all of that I just never once cared about her. She just doesn't work.In contrast Chris Hemsworth's character does work for me. I found his lines were far stronger and funnier. His lazy attitude and stuck uppityness was a treat to see. In many ways he felt like he should have been in this movie more. Sadly he doesn't even come in until after we get done with boring Molly's backstory. Also his name being Agent H like Agent Hemsworth was funny to me.The villains are pretty bland. Not much more to say thereThere is a twist in the film that I didn't see coming, but at the same time it also does a bit of damage to rest of the movie as a whole and feels like the twist hurts other better scenes in the film.In conclusion MIB International is a pretty meh and average blockbuster with not much to offer itself. The best thing about it was Chris Hemsworth's character while everyone else comes off very plain.",Men in Black - International

210,CriticalOfEverything,"Bad, but still sort of fun.",4,14 June 2019,"Men in Black hasn't had a very good track record of films. The first one to this day is still really good but the sequel dipped down in quality so much that it wa sbarely recognisable, and the third one, while perfectly fine, was still lacking in plenty of areas. So to have a spin-off of the franchise with some new agents and a new story isn't such a far fetched idea. It's just a shame they somehow managed to botch it up.The movie isn't as bad as the MIB 2, but it still presents plenty of issues. Firstly, the CG was pretty bad. This has been an issue since the third movie for me as it seems like this franchises' CG hasn't moved out of the mid-2000's in terms of quality. Everything on screen looks incredibly fake and many effects are just jaw-droppingly bad. The writing also isn't the best and the story is incredibly low-stakes, even though the original movies were light-hearted and fun there was still a sense of danger to be found, but in this movie ther ejust plain isn't. Many of the jokes don't land and the only times I found myself remotely charmed or smiling in this movie was due to the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson. I think Thor Ragnarok established that these two work off of each other and with each other perfectly and it sort of carries on with this film but only in certain places. Despite some issues though, the movie is still kind of enjoyable in a bit of a mix of so-bad-it's-good with actual fun presented from the movie. But it can't really save what is a pretty sloppy film that may have just single-handedly killed the Men in Black franchise and stopped it from ever getting another movie, and if I'm honest I'm fine with that. It doesn't do enough to justify it's own existence, but at least I didn't feel like I was being tortured while watching it.",Men in Black - International

I wasnt expecting much but both leads should've stopped their acquaintance at Thor.Hemsworth was almost going for an up to date cool and hip James Bond type, whereas Tessa didn't even seem to fit in to her accent and isn't going to be winning any awards any time soon with her display in this.

Emma Thompsons return as O was nice to see and keeping the story running with only a picture to remind you that Agent J and K are complete legends. Then that is where the similarities end the awkward comedy that both Hemsworth and Thompson seem to bring to the table isnt good. The quirky 'Nerd' angle that all studios want to take just doesnt work when you've had the swarve cool 90s legend of the previous movies. Even the 3rd one was redeemed by WIll Smith and Boris' exchanges.The twist you can see half an hour into this film but was a good enough idea just very boringly played. The other aliens who were 'Bad' turn out to be good and the 'Good' guy turns out to be a replaced version of who he once was. Also 'High T'!

MIB is funny, has a decent storyline, excitement and throw in a few chases makes it more than watchable. The rest of the cast do a good job too at selling their characters. So what do we have: humour, eye candy, decent acting, fair enough script, so why the poor rating? Maybe we are getting spoiled and people are expecting too much. Imagine someone coming back from the dead who lived fifty years ago. Would they be so harsh with their scores? I actually enjoyed it more than I expected to.

The story is a good tribute to the two older MIB films, it has a very MIB-esq feel that honestly does not feel any worse than the predecessors. Not really appreciating the ""International"" flavor that is forcibly attached to the film, but then definitely understand the reasoning behind it. The lowish score is all attributed to the severe lack of chemistry between the two leads, and why the older films will always be better, and a major reason why we all watch the franchise. Not that I agree with it, but I definitely expect more MIB films to come, but only in concept. We won't ever find that sort of partnership again, and MIB will never find that shine. Also could have had more Easter eggs from the older films as they were so iconic.

231,eparazak,"MIB International is a highly flawed, yet moderately enjoyable take on the MIB franchise.",6,20 June 2019,"Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson reunite in this Men in Black spinoff that is keen on exploring a different faction of the organization. A woman who has had an indirect encounter with the Men in Black organization tracks it down and joins the team. She is sent to the UK division as a trainee as Agent M and meets Agent H. Together, they must uncover a plot that could threaten the world as they know it.Men in Black is an interesting franchise for me. I enjoyed the first and third one, but the second one was iffy to me. I went in optimistically with the information given. We have Hemsworth and Thompson working together after their work in the MCU. To me, they're the best part of the movie. I love the chemistry between the two, they work really well together. They have a lot of moments where they shine as a buddy duo, fom serious to funny moments all throughout the movie. Speaking of which, this may be the most lighthearted of the Men in Black films, and I feel like that's to get the PG-13 audience in. I know a lot of people will be upset with this film because of that, but I didn't mind the lighter tone for the most part. I liked a lot of the new aliens, alien designs as well as the production design. I was also surprised to see some familiar faces get some cameo appearances such as Frank the pug.My biggest problem with this movie is that its plot felt derivative of the first film. There were a lot of elements that I felt were already done in the original Men in Black, and were done better. For instance, we have the adventure aspect, the idea that time may be running out, and the final battle at the end was done much better in the first one. I felt as though the plot was largely a rehash of the original MIB, and this is the second of three follow-ups of this franchise that do this. I also had some other problems with the film. For example, despite praising the lighter tone, I had a problem with its occasional attempts of pandering to the young crowd. For example, they meet a Pawny who worships Agent M as a queen, which appears to be a reference to the Ugandan Knuckles meme. It's stuff like this that can take out the enjoyment of a film.Despite my complaints, I really did have a good time seeing this movie simply because it's a Men in Black movie. Unless we're talking about, maybe, the second movie, they have a unique charm that usually works here. I have my issues, but this was an okay movie.6/10",Men in Black - International
232,Martinito_08183,The worst film in the Men in Black series.,3,19 September 2019,"The Men in Black series may not be the most famous property that Sony Pictures Entertainment has, but that doesn't mean that it's bad at all. The series does have some good things that everyone can enjoy and they do succeed in some of the most important aspects. Say whatever you want about the first Men in Black film, but that film does have it's heart at the right place, it was unique at the time and you can tell that the people, who made it really cared, but i can't say the same thing to it's sequels, but i still enjoy them, even with their flaws and how they fail at some moments.Men in Black: International is the exact opposite of those films. It's very bland at best. The story is uninspired and it has predictable moments; it's poorly written and very unfunny; very forgettable music and most of the time i didn't even noticed it; the characters are unlikable and i didn't found the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson to be good at all; the acting is weak, but i don't blame the actors for that and it's obvious who is responsible for that reason; the cinematography was very mediocre with some shots here and there that were good and most of the visual effects are very fake. The film failed at many things that were very important in the art of filmmaking, being boring most of the time and both of those things makes it the worst film of the series.",Men in Black - International
233,Wikkid_Gamez,Not as good as the original...,7,14 June 2019,"But better than all the sequels....It is obviously, definitely in the same universe as the others but I'm not so sure it is intended to be a sequel, or a remake, but another area of the same universe. After all ""The universe IS expanding"".... I mean seriously? Did no one else catch that not even remotely hidden double meaning? I know that people had to have figured that out easily enough. Marvel is doing that all over the place with superhero movies getting churned out left and right, so why can't other movies do it? So many harsh reviews ... People get so defensive over things like this and I don't know why.I thought the movie was fun, lighthearted and yes it is geared towards the younger audience.... But so was the original... The difference is everyone complaining about that probably was the younger audience when the original came out. I know I was a kid, and I remember loving it. The point is, stuff like this doesn't grow with the viewers of the original. It stays at the same target audience basically giving them what it gave us the first time around.I did enjoy it, even though it was predictable with a typical cliche ending that I knew was coming the whole movie. However, it was still fun and my kids (who are about the same age I was when the first one came out) absolutely loved it. They of course did not see the movie playing out how it did because they are young... My parents probably knew how it would go when we saw the original movie the same way I knew with this one and my kids. That's just how it goes.That said, if you are not the type to hold a movie up in comparison to some other movie made 22 years ago just because there is something to compare it to then give this one a chance...

Gary Gray had numerous issues on set with the higher-ups, so I can't completely point the finger at him.I can't quite believe how amateur this film is, the cinematography is so basic and at times terrible, most noticeable a shot early on of Tessa Thompson running away under the Brooklyn Bridge revealing her MIB suit, it looked like a bad take that was used anyway. Nothing works, I hate everything about this film, it's incomprehensibly shoddy and it's well and truly buried the franchise. Please stay dead, give us new ideas.",Men in Black - International
238,helenbassett,Men In Black: International Film Review - Director F Gary Gray Takes Chris Hemsworth & Tessa Thompson On A Mulder & Scully Alien Ride,10,22 June 2019,"The truth is out there and in Men In Black: International, young Molly is determined to discover it. When a cute Disney princess style alien bounces into her bedroom one night, she watches her parents memories of the encounter being zapped by the Men In Black outside her window. But Molly's memory of the event is left intact as they think she's sleeping, and 20 years later she grows up to be the keen Tessa Thompson, always looking for extra terrestrials, and a way into the Men In Black action.When she finally finds their office, hiding in plain sight, Molly is taken to Emma Thompson's Agent O. The Woman in Black in charge of the New York Men In Black office!, Agent O gives Molly the opening she has been looking for. And the new Woman In Black is appropriately suited and booted and fast tracked to London, (love the train), on probation as Agent M, where she meets the London big cheese; Liam Neeson's Agent High T. No first names. Liam always adds gravitas with that voice of his to the most cheesy of roles. And Molly bags a gig working with the London poster boy Chris Hemsworth: Agent H. For Hot maybe? He's just so dreamy, as the London office, and Molly, swoon.But Agent H is resting on his laurels, (asleep at the wheel!), and forever tells the story of how he and High T saved the planet one night in Paris three years ago, at the top of the golden lit Eiffel Tower. Where the film started. In a blink and you'll miss it, (what just happened?), with nothing but their wits and series-70 atomizers, they took on The Hive aliens, and win. We may not have been the only one to miss it! But the event is commemorated around the London office in life size mythical paintings of T & H.As the top London Agent, H is assigned to show a high ranking alien, I'm going to call him Fungus The Bogeyman, a good time in London. He's actually called Vungus the Ugly. Not so Kayvan Novak who voices him. With Molly along for the pimp my ride their night is cut short by a colourful pair of alien twins, played by Les Twins, not Thompson though! They don't stand out much in an alien night club, and in the frantic action Fungus passes Molly an important crystal jewel. (Actually the world's most dangerous and valuable weapon, it's powered by a star.) Fungus says he cannot trust H with it. He's changed.And Agent H does seem very shallow and showy, what made him such a good agent seems to have gone to his head. Not surprising with the paintings of his noble deed everywhere. If he had long blonde hair you could imagine him tossing it now and again! Chris Hemsworth is so good in the role!And yet back in the office, by the book Rafe Spall's Agent C is wildly jealous of H and his career, and cannot quite put his finger on why he has been so successful. Given he seems a dick! And he thinks High T always covers for H. And he does again after the Fungus the Bogeyman incident, but clever Molly thinks there might be a mole, as who knew they were taking Fungus out.As our Men In Black title says, we go International to unravel the mystery, to Marrakesh where H&M meet a CGI chess character they name Pawny. Voiced by Kumail Nanjiani he gets some good lines and they make a great team. The kids will love him. And just off Naples Rebecca Ferguson is a many arms dealer, who just might be interested in the world's most dangerous and valuable weapon when it is stolen. But H had a relationship with her, of course he did, and it did not end well. Of course it didn't. And the alien twins are still hot footing it after the weapon.The MiB action is fast and furious, with colourful special effects, and the better than Bond gadgets of fast cars, bikes and guns are head swivelling. Although the sets did feel like sets, which in a way was quite endearing given this is in no way meant to resemble reality! I did spot a Greggs takeaway though, just keeping it real on the London street. And when it came to a natural ending I thought okay, but something was missing, and then we had the second all will be revealed act.The Eiffel Tower made a glamorous background and the wildly inventive story that Eiffel was the first to discover the wormhole through which the first aliens travelled was almost believable in a sci-fi sort of way. And as our heroes use the rickety old lift to the top it could have been a H G Wells story, with better special effects.Don't come if you are expecting For Your Consideration Oscar fodder, but do go along for riotous seat of your pants action that doesn't take itself too seriously, and F Gary Gray's movie is a lot of fun.No after credit scenes but Columbia wearing the dark sunglasses is cool.",Men in Black - International

I went by some low scores because people shouted about to much CGI, silly looking aliens, dumb downed story, plot hole issues...etc.Turns out none of that was really an issue. If anything most of this is normal for MIB movies. Weird aliens, CGI fest, loopholes...etc. No one goes to see these movies for deep story or Oscary worth performances. I wasn't sure also about seeing it because I wanted Will and Tommy. But that story officially ended in the last movie. This takes place in the London branch of MIB. Though you do see ""parts"" that have to do with NYC briefly. Chris and Tessa have REALLY great chemistry. Probably beacuse of them acting together in Thor Ragnarok.If you look at the reviews, half of the ""1 stars"" are complaining about a woman being the real lead role and ""Mary Sue"" stuff. I am not a fan but I didn't really see this in the movie. Just because a woman is in the lead role doesn't mean it's some sneaky agenda for ""woman power"". Women exist, women exists in lead roles. It's nothing new.If I had any complaint at all it would be that one of the main aliens in the movie ""Pawny"" looked kind of stupid and felt like a gimmicky character.

247,dagallop,Not great but not terrible!,7,22 June 2019,"This is NOT a spin off movie! This is from the same stable as the Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones camp. However.... The things that made the other MiB movies 'fun' got churned back out on too many occasions in this one and subsequently a lot of the good got lost in it.
I actually think that Chris Hemsworth was a good fit and as for Tessa Thomson, she was absolutely perfect, assuming that the role wasn't written wholly based on her playing it!
The story is the same old same old but that doesn't matter, the twists are few and far between (that is the reason a lot of reviews suggest that this is for the younger viewer - i.e. shorter attention span!) but they work. There are a couple of sequences that seem to have absolutely no bearing on the story, possibly some scenes were cut and they forgot that there were explanatory scenes earlier that could/should have been removed along with them.
The special effects are top notch and fit well, although some of the CGI is just there to prove that they can do that!

248,jaywensley2004,Familiarity is in the memory of the viewer,7,14 June 2019,"""Men in Black: International"" is nothing more or less than a restart for the franchise.While there are appropriate nods to the movie's predecessors, ""MIB: International"" simultaneously owes nothing and everything to the previous chapters. And that dichotomy is the film's primary weakness, because ""MIB: International"" is as formulaic as a recipe for Toll House cookies. Anyone who has seen ANY of the previous MIB movies, is going to be familiar with the main ingredients of this new one.But that's okay, because the strength of the new MIB movie is that the lead actors make their roles fully theirs. Tessa Thompson as Agent M carries her part with credibility, and generates viable chemistry with co-star Chris Hemsworth (Agent H), even though the script and the direction lead the characters into a mostly platonic, sweet/no-heat affection for each other.Chris Hemsworth's performance is a revelation. He shows depth that was never explored in his Marvel Movie Universe roles. In fact, in two scenes (explaining himself to Riza, and later, when he gives instructions to Agent C about what to do if the mission is a failure), he delivers single lines of dialogue with sincerity and gravity that is only surprising because I had never before seen Hemsworth demonstrate that capacity. Agent H IS heroic, and Hemsworth sells that message...convincingly.While ""MIB: International"" is going to feel too familiar for fans of the previous movies, it is made for a new audience, one that does not know Agents J and K, and for them, I think this film is an excellent launch to a reset for the franchise.",Men in Black - International

For those of you who don't know mib was actually a very dark comic book series part of marvel and was later sold to Sony pictures along with Spiderman when the company went bankrupt . The first mib movie reinvented the entire lore into a light hearted buddy comedy and set up a unique world with a very different sense of humor . The world that the first movie set up gave birth to an animated series with the same color tone and set the standard for mainstream mib. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were a great duo and despite all the garbage in mib 2. Mib 3 made up for it in a great way. Now MIB International is nothing close to it's predecessors , it's a soft reboot taking place in the same universe as the previous movies . Chris Hemsorth and Tessa Thompson had good chemistry cause Thor Ragnarok . 5 minutes into this movie and all the Scooby Doo you've watched tells you who the bad guy is. That's just about it.

There is some ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" (TTSS), some ""Avatar"" grade CGI, and even some hints of ""007"" in there. We may even be looking at Chris Hemsworth as a good candidate for James Bond when Daniel Craig hangs steps away; Hemsworth is very strong and cool agent for the MIB gang and, make no mistake, this is an all MIB film.In this episode there are plenty of new things including a new agent in a probation training role. The new agent in training more than holds her own against what the evil aliens throw at her. The added bonus is a mole high up in the agency that needs to be dealt with as in ""Tinker, Tailor,Soldier, Spy"" fashion. This is a darn good film worthy of being in the line of preceding MIB films. Make no mistake, this is not a lame sequel by any means.Like others have said, watch this film with an open mind.

If one other person comes to me to parrot-repeat all that empty, meaningless 'Mary Sue'-whining nonsense I swear I will lose it!For just any mediocre standard entertainment movie the movie and story in itself are ok-ish.
But wait: wasn't this supposed to be a MIB-movie? And weren't those supposed to be funny comedies? Where were my dozens of over the top cartoonish aliens? Where were the constant jokes and the joyful bliss of watching two hours of sweet and relaxing total nonsense?Nope. To me, this did not follow the MIB-recipe. Most of the aliens were designed so serious, and this movie kept going on for way too long periods of time taking itself so seriously, I totally forgot it was supposed to be a silly sci-fi comedy. I often felt like I was watching some kind of dead serious mixture of Star Wars and The Avengers.6 out of 10 from me because the movie definitely wasn't bad, and I did make it to the end. But I barely had any good old traditional MIB-fun at all.",Men in Black - International
268,MovieBinger,Mehwomen in Black,7,22 July 2019,The moment Liam said the line I knew he was the bad guy lol. Can't judge a movie by reviews as I thought it was going to be bad but was actually quite entertaining. Chris wasn't that much of a bumbling dummy like most of the movies have made him which was relief for once. Tessa was a good character but as Hollywood does with female leads is they tend too be to perfect with no flaws or weaknesses. I know I know but come on. Anyway besides that the story was a little weak and was also sad that they didn't acknowledge the past MIB agents or anything related to them.,Men in Black - International
269,brandonbray-35698,Not bad at all. Whatever stupid reviewers,9,23 December 2019,Easily probably my fave Men in black. Not boring at all. Fun for sure. And love it having a female lead. Im a male that can respect a movie with a female lead and not say it's trying to be feminist. Maybe we should stop being malist about everything. It's tiresome. And egotistical. And makes men look like dirtbags.,Men in Black - International
270,Chance_Boudreaux19,Rehashing the same old ideas instead of switching it up,4,30 October 2019,"This movie is just the same old Men in Black formula done again without any twists or turns. Even the switching of the setting to London does nothing to make the movie interesting. The chemistry between the new agents is meh, it's certainly much worse than that of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. There's really not much to say about this film because it just felt like a Hollywood movie made for the sake of being inoffensive and capitalizing off of an already established property. It's just the most basic plot that tries to be as formulaic as possible to mildly satisfy viewers for 2 hours as they shove popcorn in their mouths. There is one standout however and that is Chris Hemsworth. The guy can really act and has good comedic timing and him playing a James Bond like character was quite entertaining. And therein lies the franchises opportunity to switch it up which was wasted. The movie could've ditched the buddy cop formula for a more Bond-like one. We get glimpses of this towards the beginning and I'd argue those are the best moments and so a whole movie centered on Hemsworth being a lone wolf agent on a mission might've had real potential and it would've given us something new. The plot could've still had comedy but maybe a slightly more serious take might've also been a good idea. Agent H traversing the globe, struggling with alcoholism and being too sure of himself whilst meeting various exotic alien women along the way certainly sounds more entertaining that what we got.",Men in Black - International

The two had better humor in Thor and honestly....seeing them both in this movie was a little distracting knowing their history in Avengers. The story too was just there. It's watchable, but when I think about it disappointing. If they wanted to reboot this thing they should have put more effort into this. Even the aliens were not interesting . I honestly think this movie getting made had something to do with the Theme Parks, They have a ride there and without making another movie quickly the ride is starting to become irrelevant.

276,tomtalbotty,Men In Black International brought back memories nice spin on the movie especially with Molly Agent M.,10,26 August 2019,"This movie even though I would agree it is not good as the original classic Men In Black Movies with Will Smith as the lead protagonist in. This brought back the franchise with a lovely funny spin to it especially having Molly (Agent M) played by Tessa Thompson was just so refreshing as the men in black agency are normally able to neuralyze everyone that seen anything that is out of the ordinary, nevertheless they missed out Molly who they thought was asleep in her bedroom as a kid. Molly setting out to find this secret agency twenty years later she hacks into a satellite then finds them after everyone thinks she is delusional, which she follows the Men In Black back to the New York Headquarters where she waltzes in through the front door that I thought is hilarious. Having Chris Hemsworth as Agent H (Harry) is so funny as he is kind of your average joker does not care what everyone thinks that does do what he wants when he wants, compared to Molly Agent M played by Tessa Thompson really keeps everything serious and logical while having a laugh from time to time. The random flirtations between the two is just nice to see really does gives Molly Agent M taking control in these flirtations interactions as she is a strong independent woman that knows what she wants and she knows exactly what she is doing, then Agent H (Harry) is much more of a flirtier protagonist that just wings it into action than logically thinks about what he is doing like Molly Agent M does when jumping into any kind of action with danger in. Pawny is just great an Alien who is just as well a bit of a joker he is also very kind and loyal towards his friends especially Molly his queen as he calls her. This movie is great to watch I hope they bring more Men In Black movies in the future as it is starting to show more equality with feminism, which I love that Women can be powerful protagonists too in these films not just your typical damsel in distress. This gives more opportunities to actors where the stories can run wilder becoming less predictable with more of a Gen Z way of life projected across films.",Men in Black - International

The plot wasn't fresh and it wasn't exciting. While it was funny in some parts that in no way made up for the lazy writing and forced story. The villain was bland and predictable. It seems that maybe Men In Black should've been a one and done deal. Even though Kumail Nanjiani is one of the best parts of this movie, he still couldn't save this from being bland.

This movie wasn't really interesting and was a superficial love story. The coolness of the first movie has never been captured in any movie after.

300,Daviteo,A very solid 7,7,11 June 2020,"First, I'm usually really good at getting close to what the average user rating for a movie is without seeing the reviews on here, within half a star or better. But with MIB: International, I have to break with that and score this almost two stars higher than it got, and I think the main reason is that the reviewers on here didn't like seeing a female person of color protagonist. I can't think of any other reason this movie got scored as low as it did. It's a super fun summer popcorn flick and doesn't try to be anything other than that.The most major con I can think of is that while the creature CGI is pretty good, the green-screen work looks way off at times. Also, some of the jokes fell flat (although some were quite good).But on the good side, the main characters' chemistry was great (and for those complaining that Hemsworth was just there to be a ""buffoon,"" were you even paying attention to what happened to him during the course of the story?). Thompson definitely can helm a movie. The supporting roles were all great. And, in my opinion, this is the best Men In Black movie after the first one.I also don't get why people were complaining about the location changes. I felt those were a great departure from having the whole movie set in New York.But I believe the hate this movie got was from people hating seeing the lead of a movie be a female person of color, people crying, ""but the hero wasn't a white guy, waaaaaah!"" Personally, I think Thompson was a great choice for a lead, and I hope people aren't swayed by the other reviews on here and instead go see the movie.",Men in Black - International
301,DrDarkness,So much unnecessary flexing with cgi and gadgets,4,27 October 2019,"MIB: International is pretty much a stand-alone movie with no need for seeing any of the previous Men In Black flicks. Everything gets explained from the start so the audience can just dive in to the world of aliens and people wearing black suits.The plot: Average, with some twists and and turns, trying to give the audience lots of possible leads for the possible ending. However, this is done with very lazy manner, so both me and my husband could predict the ultimate truth in the first 20-30 minutes or so. And again with the old ""Oh, he's arrogant and she doesn't believe in love, CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA LEARN"".The cast: Sigh. So, you had the budget for your actors, and decided to use what, 75% of it to get Chris Hemsworth. Liam Neeson of course does a great job, but just about everyone else are very awkward in their roles. Even Chris feels like he's not supposed to be there.The CGI: Definitely have seen better. And what's with the very, very unnecessary flexing?? There's a ton of scenes where the whole thing is just done because ""hey look what we can do"" -feel in it. Like with the train. Why was the train first normal, and then changed into hyper futuristic kind? There was no need for the cover up since the train was clearly only in the use of MIB, so this whole scene was kind of pointless.Men in Black: International is definitely a brainless pop corn action, with no need to overthink anything.

Flash forward 20 or so years and you see her applying to join the FBI. They make a point to say she is the best candidate in the history of the FBI. Why....because she is a women of course. So they give her the pick of any division to work in.She asks to join the Men in Black devision, which they know nothing about. So she immediately quits the FBI and joins the CIA. And becomes the best candidate in the history of the CIA....Why....Do I need to say. And again they give her the pick of any division to work in. She asks to join the MIB. But there is none within the CIA. So she quits the CIA too.Then she just walks into the MIB building and asks to join. So they team her with the agent that they say repeatedly, is the best agent in the history of the MIB. Who is actually a bungling idiot who couldn't even tie his own shoe laces together.Imediately she saves his life repeatedly, tells him what to do as he doesn't know, and knows things about the MIB she couldn't possibly know....Why.....Who knows, because shes a women again??I am sick and tired of Hollywood turning 80s and 90s classics into these stupid female propaganda tropes with women being the worst types of Mary Sues imaginable in them.",Men in Black - International

Which is frustrating, because so much of it wasn't necessary when the protagonist, Thompson's M, already knows what's up - we didnt need quite so much 'oh shoot, aliens' content, and she gave the film an excuse it didn't opt to use.The dueling arcs of the film, Neeson's 'the universe has a way of things being where they are supposed to' or whatever it was, and the spy-ish 'there's a mole in the organization' were both served with too many momentum wounding moments, which left the film feeling like a drag for all but thirty or so minutes of actual *stuff*, and then still ending up with an incredibly rushed finale, which suffered from a profound lack of tension.The whole thing, and this happens sometimes with effects heavy films, feels a bit...stapled together. And while much of that is salved by lead duo's star power, it's not enough to save it. Still better than MIB 2, though!Saw it for free thanks to Starz donating some time due to epidemic - a fun quarantine flick, but not something I'd pay for.",Men in Black - International

Some of the reviews are saying ""do not listen to trolls, it is a good movie"" etc. No it is not. This is a joke and very bad one. First they they couldn't even make an interesting story
(hello it is the whole god damn universe and they couldn't even make the original one), no, they copied the script from first MIB (how original) and they managed to ruin it too, but most important thing is a waste of good actors (except Tessa Thompson, she was never good). Dont get me wrong, the first MIB is great movie but this is disaster. The characters are so annoying that is beyond the words to even try to explain, from the main one to Jar Jar Binks lookalike. Bad guys just dance most of the time in movie which is very irritating. The only thing they changed is the main character because she is a woman and she sucks really bad. This is a last Predator movie syndrome. They really destroyed all the good from original.",Men in Black - International
316,Lursa,Les Twin were AWESOME. Everything else not so much,4,23 June 2019,"Spoilers Ahead. Turn Back Now!I saw MIB: International and, for the most part, I was unimpressed. It was very obvious from the first segment of the movie who the real bad guy was going to be. There were no surprises in the film. At. All.I like Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, just not in this. Okay, we KNOW you're Thor and Valkyrie from the MCU. We did not need the obligatory hammer reference. Why is his character super stupid in the movie? Was it because of the Liam Neeson character's use of the neuralyzer on him. Emma Thompson is one of my favorite actresses and I just wanted to cry at the waste of her formidable talent. Also, what is WITH Australians suddenly finding their inner comedian (a'la Mel Gibson) and just running with it?! If frat boy humor is your thing then maybe Hemsworth will be better served in the next Lethal Weapon or Zac Efron movie. As a matter of fact, Zac would have been a better choice as Agent H. I did not like the Agent M character. There was no chemistry between Agent M and Agent H. How could there be? H is an idiot. M is all-knowing, consistently saves the day and is so 'Mary Sue' that I thought that's what the 'M' stood for. Let's just let this franchise die in peace.This film is exactly what I expected. It is bland, uninventive, repackaged and so very, very boring I had a hard time staying awake. I didn't have high hopes. There was such a waste of awesome talent beginning with the director. F. Gary Gray is a good director. I loved A Man Apart; Law Abiding Citizen; and Fate of the Furious. I do not know what happened here but I'm betting on the script that was written by Matt Holloway (Transformer: The Last Knight, which should have served as a huge red flag right there); Art Marcum (Punisher: War Zone, that says it all.); and Lowell Cunningham (who created the comic book). I'm placing the blame for this mishmash on the shoulders of Holloway and Marcum. Let's face it, if you are known for awful scripts that have a colon in them, then you need to rethink your writing strategy. I'll give you that they both worked on Iron Man, but they were part of a four-writer team on that one. Just sayin'.Honestly, the only reason I walked in the theater and plunked down my money was to see Les Twins. Larry and Laurent Bourgeois are 6'5"" identical twins, fashion models, and arguably the best hip-hop dancers in the world. The twins played the red herring bad alien. I thoroughly enjoyed their screen time. In fact, I was only totally engaged in the film when they were on screen. Anyone who is familiar with Larry and Laurent know that their musicality and physicality is off the charts, so it was no surprise that they made the aliens very compelling. They didn't have much dialog but that wasn't a problem. Honestly, the derivative dialog was lack luster. I do want to see more of Les Twins on the big screen. I'm looking forward to seeing them in CATS later this year.My recommendation is that you do not waste your money going to your favorite multi-plex to see this movie. Only go if you want to enjoy Les Twins on the big screen. Otherwise do what I'm going to do. Buy the bluray and fast forward through the boring parts.",Men in Black - International

But as a film it's all quite flat and unfortunate to say - dull. There's just a complete lack of on-screen chemistry between anyone, the story comes across as a poor copy of all the previous films, and most damning of all it lacks any real wit or imagination. Really wierd as the two leads wereso good together when they appeared in the last Thor film.

Anyway lets go straight to plot, its not good. Why? well everything in the movie that the characters do is ONLY to progress the plot, they have no motive of their own, no agency to do anything. And this is sad because its used to be the key theme of MiB, an agent who saves people, but no one knows he exists and he is in contact with the whole of the Universe but still finds himself ALONE in the Universe. That struggle is what used to set MiB agents like Jay apart from others.How did they mess this up again?. This is simple stuff, just cast Will Smith, or is he not black enough?.
Hemsworth and the black chick, dont know her name, were ok but it was too high school slice of life material. There's the tall hunky pretty white boy who is a dumb bimbo and the quirky nerdy black chick who is intelligent and knows everything, EVERYTHING, even when she gets alien weaponry that according to the movie she shouldnt have knowledge about or on, she knows it, just like that.Like a friend used to say there is a scientist and a movie scientist, two different kind those. See if a movie scientist was a molecular biologist, he can do xenomorph anatomy AND highly complex neuro-engineering AND merge brains together, but a real scientist would reply ""err i do not possess the necessary skills as a simple biologist to construct an alien brain merging machine"". Thats where verisimilitude lies.Anyway, plot holes everywhere, if you are in Fiji you can even use them as boreholes they are that deep and ridiculous to watch, another fantastic series ruined.1/10",Men in Black - International

Although this is a review of MIB International, it could just as easily be a review of Hellboy or John Wick 3. The lack of a decent script seems to be the biggest problem with all these films. A cobbled together story that barely holds up, jumps around, and fails to entertain. It seems Hollywood has decided that our desire for sequels means they will churn out any old rubbish and we will be stupid enough to watch it.

I mean, if you thought Rey from Star Wars was bad, just wait until you see this.Seriously, how many times do they have to make this mistake? It's not something people want to see, and it actually takes away from a character. I have no problems with female leads.  But a female lead can be the hero/star without being a Mary-Sue. Here's a few off the top of my head: Wonder Woman (2017), Katniss from Hunger Games, Selene from Underworld, Sarah Conner from Terminator, Ripley from Alien. All great female leads, and not one a Mary-Sue.

Blind and deaf - people would be another great demographic.This garbage can be referred to as Ghostbusters (2016) Number 2, not just because it's extremely close to fecal matter, but also because it pays cheap lip service to ideologies and temporary issues of politics without understanding or even trying to understand their implications.
It comes of like an actual alien with no understanding of human culture or social norms pathetically trying to relate to you and your humanness.And if that wasn't a hard enough pill to swallow, they inexplicably chose to fill the whole runtime to the brim with sexual innuendo, terrible jokes only a paid audience would laugh at and the worst action and special effects since Ghostbusters (2016). All the interactions feel forced, characters and motivations are either stupid, cliché or unexplained.The script is nonexistent.
If someone told me this was written by a dopey twelve year old I would believe them without question.
By the end nothing makes sense and not a single action beat feels intense, emotional or earned. Nobody grows or changes and the whole thing didn't matter at all.It looks cheap, sounds cheap, feels cheap but somehow cost 110 million dollars to produce. Which once again solidifies the idea that it's not about how big your stick is, it's about how hard you can hit with it.Overall, put this thing in the dumpster where it belongs and do not watch this unless you want a brain aneurysm.",Men in Black - International

Script is messy and predictable, but the actors kept the movie going.",7,24 November 2019,"The reboot obviously cannot be compared to the original cast and iconic theme song. When the first one came out, it was a pop culture phenomenon: many moviegoers (men, women, kids) dressed in black suits and wore Ray Bans. That's how cool the movie was.Setting that aside, I expected this film to be at least entertaining. Well, the new aliens, Pawny (Kumail Nanjiani) and Riza (Rebecca Ferguson) helped lighten up the screen. Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth could have had better chemistry if the script wasn't so soggy.The conspiracy / crisis was hard to follow, because the villains and target were introduced through hectic and mumbled dialogues in the MIB headquarters and the dance club. The sounds should have been clearer in post production. The dialogues and tone flipped flopped between funny and serious.I think the movie would have gotten better if it was scripted and edited more neatly.

330,WillsFilms,"After Seeing Men In Black: International, I Want To Be Neuralized",5,15 June 2019,"Men In Black: International is a movie. A generic, harmless, average movie. The actors are fine. Chris Hemsworth is likeable and funny as Agent H and Tessa Thompson is good as Agent M. The two actors have good chemistry with each other and are effective leads. Kumail Nanjiani as Pawney is also a fun character to have along for the ride. Unfortunately, everything else about the movie is quite bad. The plot is a mess and feels very rushed at a few points in the movie, in particular, Agent H's character. We're told so much about how much of a great agent he is and how he's changing and there's a big mystery behind why, which I won't spoil, that I feel like there's another movie with this character that Sony forgot to make. If the basis of his character arc is why he's changed, we need to know what he's changed from and that's only explained through exposition. The supporting cast are nothing special. Liam Neeson is fine, Emma Thompson is fine and Rafe Spall is fine. The villians are incredibly weak. We learn pretty much nothing about who they are or what they are and I still can't figure out who the main villain is and what his goals are. If you're watching this movie for Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, then you'll get what you came for, as they are both the saving grace of the movie, but this film suffers from poor writing and abysmal antagonists.

Sadly this was not a good choice either. It was fun to see some familiar characters and references but that certainly was not enough to carry this movie.Chris Hemsworth has played the fool most delightfully in past movies but here it doesn't make sense. How would such an idiot even get into the M.I.B.? I can't hate Chris' performance because he's just so damn beautiful and I've never seen a man look so incredible in pink trousers but as soon as he started talking my attention wandered.Tessa Thompson was alright and about time they added a woman, I expected Linda Fiorentino to be Will Smith's partner in M.I.B. II and was greatly disappointed she wasn't. Tessa does a passable job but she isn't really all that interesting either.
I'm sorry but even Liam Neeson channeling the force was not enough to save this movie. Referencing past movies these actors have been in was way too corny.Half way through the movie my fingers got itchy, they wanted to push the fast forward button, to put it into 1 word, the movie is boring. Yeah there's some action scenes and some cool CGI, been there done that give me a good story, make the characters interesting and make me get lost in the movie. Chris and Tessa in my opinion didn't have any chemistry, it kind of makes me wonder if they didn't hate each other off screen?Even if you're a die hard M.I.B. fan I'd say wait until it comes to cable or you can rent it for $1.99, it shouldn't take too long for that to happen because this movie pretty much stinks.

This movie takes no risks. The irony of MIB was probably considered too risky and is dearly missed. Whst is left is sort of a James Bond movie without James Bond with a few aliens and hip hop music thrown in.
Nice blockbuster entertainment but no more that that. It says something the only scene that really has a groove is tough guy Inny Clemons's confrontation with an alien in the beginning.
There are some interesting aliens, but their characters but they are catroons only - somehow don't materialize. Ah... the first men in black, provocative Will Smith, lonesome cowboy-ish Tommy Lee Jones, all the other characters... Still, this is better fre than men in black three, within a Hollywood formula it is even good it doesn't totally lose itself in the GCI. The first minutes turn out to be relevant for the plot, but how dull compared to the alien fun and insect games and the sarcastic illegal immigration pastiches MIB 1 started with.
Poor Chris Hemsworth, as static as a fashion model, poor Tessa Thompson walking around like a zombie reciting texts, lost in F. Gary Gray's universe A robot-like Liam Neeson, a faintly Judi Dench-like Emma Thompson... MIB is about IRONY guys!

I longed for preposterous plots with K and J, but instead got tired spy drama with H and M.In the original, aliens tried to blend with humans, never quite getting it, although they enjoyed simple pleasures on earth: pierogis, Twister, pastrami sandwiches, et al. Now, swashbuckling agents track suave aliens and banter back and forth as if trapped in a rough cut of Star Wars or Guardians of the Galaxy.Chris Hemsworth does make for a likeably irrepressible hunk while Tessa Thompson wins us over as a more nerdy buff making good. Meanwhile, her sidekick Pawny overdoes the cutesy critter routine, making us wish a flyswatter were handy.Barry Sonnenfeld was the genius behind the original franchise and although he serves as Executive Producer, allows director F. Gary Gray and the new franchise to get bogged down in clumsy suspense and brain-wracking plot.

She's had the luxury of working with a charming and funny lead twice, and it looks like she only shines under their light.

Unlike previous MIBs there was no comedy and zero chemistry between Hemsworth and Thompson.There were clear checkboxes the moviemakers wanted to hit: big, world-ending alien (check), bigger, shinier guns (check), upgraded scene of weird aliens walking around MIB HQ (check), transforming MIB car (check), flashy-thing antics (check). It's like they gave the assignment to a college kid, that kid spat out the new Franken-screenplay and the producers just threw a half-dozen A-list actors into the roles and just ran with it. For the actors involved, this was an unabashed money grab - they didn't even have to change clothes! Just some green screen work and a few dozen lines. Other than that, it could've been a Saturday morning CGI cartoon. Shameful. Don't bother with this one. It's not even worth the $2 Redbox IMHO.",Men in Black - International

352,marcvuijk,Fun but forgettable!!!,6,7 November 2019,"I had high hopes for this one, a fresh new look of the mib franchise but unfortunately it left me with a forgettable movie.
Its was fun to see Chris and Tessa working together once more but chris Hemsworth character was annoying while Tessa's performance wasn't anything special but nonetheless you felt she carried the story.
Liam Neeson's character felt out of place and you have to feel for the guy because he is been in all the wrong roles since the taken trilogy wich i thought he was amazing in.
The CGI was pretty bad in some ways but i thought the 2 villains in the story where pretty well done.
All in all it wasn't a terrible movie but it could have been so much better and i feel they have missed an opportunity to start the franchise with some great new ideas and characters.
What you get here is a mixture of the previous 3 movies but not executed to its full potential.
For me it was my least favorite of the 4 movies and you can't help..... But i really missed Will Smith in this.
Final Verdict 6/10",Men in Black - International
353,bznznoneya,Such trash,3,16 June 2019,Cannot believe Liam Neeson touched this script. Everyone else in the film was trying to be eye candy. Special effects were crap. Main Aliens were so lame I swear you could see the green screen behind.,Men in Black - International

There is no blood, no scary scenes, no sad scenes, no sex, no violence even. I don't get it I thought hollywood learned from their mistakes and yet they keep doing this same mistake over and over again. I wasn't on the edge of my seat for this movie.

The actors are greatNegatives: the film lacks ideas or direction
The villians have no back story and although the cgi looks pretty it doesn't make them any more interesting
Characters are under developed..seeing 1 flash back of a character as a child does not get us any closer to understanding the character or their motivatesOverall it's a pretty shameful reboot and can't help but feel like it's just another Hollywood cash grab ..maybe time these production companies brought more new ideas to the table and saved reboots for the right set of circumstances",Men in Black - International
359,djjimmisgr,A forgettable movie,5,27 February 2020,I think the main issue with this movie was the absence of Will Smith. Men in black without him simple isn't Men in Black.

Blockbuster movies in Hollywood these days trying to promote feminism very desperately which is one of the cause that makes movies failed badly.. Audiences are tired watching craps like this over and over.. Why must be so focus on the word Men in the name MIB? Men = Both sexes right.. It's like we must spoon feed the feminism for every single rights they need and makes them comfortable with imaginary powers over men these days.. Oh please don't cry just because MIB are not named it WIB.. Enough is enough.. By the way this movie failed in many ways..

367,sophaljonesy,Another needless sequel,5,13 June 2019,"I am not a fan of the MIB franchise, but its casting of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith gives the movie a certain charm. This is why I gave MIB: International the benefit of the doubt because we have Chris Hemsworth, Tessa Thomson, and Liam Neeson. Needless to say, it does not bring anything new to the franchise, and focuses too much on how hot Chris Hemsworth's character is. There are some funny moments, but only if you force yourself to enjoy it. In the whole movie, there is only one fight sequence that is actually enjoyable and it features Tessa Thomson's character fighting an alien. It seems the writers hesitate between making it a mystery thriller and a goofy comedy. In the end, it has neither thrills nor comedy. In fact, there are plot elements that could make for a good story and deep characters. Hemsworth and Thomson are very capable characters and could handle playing deep characters while having fun. Unfortunately, that was not meant to be, and MIB is just another run of the mill action movie that tries to be funny but fails. Watch it if you have a lot of free time, otherwise walk in the park",Men in Black - International

Hemsworth is actually painful to watch as a wise cracking jerk who joked his way through the movie; acting like one of the immature characters in Animal House. It was like watching not-so-bright Thor wearing a MIB suit, waiting to get his hammer back. I hate to say it, but the movie might've been better if he was killed off early, and Agent C took his place. The Tessa character was over-the -top with her super-intellect and know-it-all personality. The writers & producers should've watched the first MIB to get some ideas of how Will Smith's indoctrination was developed. Also the humor came form the characters being earnest about their jobs, not glib. Pawny was probably my favorite character of the film. He and Agent C were the only ones not over acting their parts. I have to admit that I REALLY miss Rip Torn as the director. He had a style that was fun to watch. . As much as I like Liam Neeson, I think that he was miscast in this film; they should've tried to get Michael Keaton or Jerry Seinfeld for that part, (or maybe Max Von Sydow if he's still acting?).",Men in Black - International

The storyline was a bit rubbish, some of the jokes were a bid crap and it was VERY predictable but, I actually quite enjoyed it. I knew it wasn't going to be a masterpiece so I didn't expect an epic movie. This is fast paced action, fun and enjoyable. We all know its not going to win an Oscar and we all know it isn't going to be serious, so why people dissect a movie like this confuses me.

If you're a movie critic, then maybe you're in the wrong profession because movies DO NOT Seem to be fulfilling your needs. Maybe do something away from the public. This was not a kids movie anymore than the others were and I, a 48 year old man enjoyed it immensely. I liked what I think may have been a Thor callback (although very subtle) when Chris Picks up a small hammer to throw at his opponent lol. The part I saw on the previews about the alien saying ""I make this look good"" and Chris and Tessa obviously recognize the phrase actually never showed in the movie. But hopefully will be on the extended cut or bonus features. The only thing I saw that didn't add up to me was this: after a high speed chase through, I believe they were in Bangladesh at the time, in which Chris drove an alien motorcycle through the town tearing up everything, which ended on a crowded block in a confrontation between Chris and the twins, the rest of the MIB team shows up to neuralize everyone on the block. Here my question- what about everyone else in the city? Lol! Literally everyone in town saw him driving on the thing, only felt the need to neuralize one small city block? Lol! That's my only continuity issue, the original MIB seemed to pay attention to even the smallest of details to make it seem as realistic (yes, I know) as it could have been lol.

The characters, humans and aliens don't have the creativity of the previous movies either.Characters like Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) were original, their characters had interesting stories and personalities; attempting to adequately substitute them with characters like Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) and Agent M (Tessa Thompson) is a joke.The quality of this movie compared to the other movies in the franchise is like comparing any top quality movie to any poor remake of it.I wouldn't recommend it, the word I would most adequately describe it with as ""boring""...",Men in Black - International

Weird yet predictable premise, jaja binks type characters that I don't care about and bloated with cgi effects. It lacks the care and attention to detail that the other films did, and feels like the alien characters were made up on the spot.

The writing was atrocious, with the overuse of so many cliches, making the overall story remarkably predictable, and little politically correct lines that just felt forced and unnecessary. The characters lacked any real substance and with the exception of Pawny, were seldom amusing. The writers relied on padding out the story with features of the original movies that were popular, but these often added little to no value to the story. To add further salt to the wounds, there was even more evidence of lazy writing with some continuity issues, such as the use or lack thereof, of the neuraliser. Furthermore, whilst it's quite common for brand placement in modern films, they should be subtle, without the need for the director to focus in unnecessarily on certain products or features, unless they would otherwise have done so if it weren't sponsored.Overall, it's an immensely forgettable movie.",Men in Black - International

the acting and aliens were pretty good.
I did not like some of the ""female"" things. Woman in black sounds like a funeral. That's why it's Man in Black. Human in black sounds even stranger.Overall I was inbetween 7 and 8, but it I would say due to lore, it's an 8.

The chemistry between Hemsworth and Thompson is brilliant and at times carries the film when the dialogue just does not deliver.
The plot is interesting in premise and Liam Neeson is a fantastic supporting act, but you do get the sense they set the runtime and almost ran out of room so the final act is a rushed and seemingly thinned out sequence that leaves you feeling a little short-changed.
There are one or two moments that made me audibly groan with disappointment at the laziness of the storytelling, but they're outweighed by the numerous good moments and the token 'alien buddy' that apparently every movie has to have now is actually enjoyable (unlike the Porgs in The Last Jedi'.

But that's because it's completely in-line with the current trend of ""let's have a multicolored diarrhea all over the nostalgia factor"". Yes, there was a pun there. Inappropriate gender/race change is hip these days, but it seems that while that MAY be passable with good script/acting, there's an interesting insistence on not doing that at all. This film is just one of many examples of that trend.Having said all of the above, one must remember these are different times we live in. While as kids of the 80-90s we loved good, well structured stories with compelling characters we could relate to. Not because of what they looked like, but because of their struggles and choices. These are the times where the struggles and choices of characters ARE all about what they look like, and that also supposed to make up the story.

You will like it if you liked Back to the Future 2.Lots of ""history repeats itself"" feel to it. Completely original yet follows the formula of the original. And it knows it. Movies like this usually only succeed when they're really funny. And I thought this one was. The second men in black cranked it up to 11 with alien craziness, but the aliens got more boring in the third. The aliens in this one were hilarious.This movie doesn't rely on the cast of the original. The cameos are likely there to extend an olive branch in case tommy and will come back. Which they've already said no. And Tommy's fighting choreography is sort of stilted now anyways. I miss the original cast, but they were luckily able to cherry pick the chemistry from Ragnarok: and it paid off.Without putting spoilers in, I can say the movie follows the same construct of the original but rebuilds it with new character chemistry and a completely different story. If it didn't, it would be terrible! It doesn't really delve into the originals at all. It has Easter eggs, but if you're not looking out for them, it's a perfect standalone movie.My favorite joke is the celebrity alien jokes.

Its just the way it is and it works, according to my view you dont need to belittle the other gender to show off like a hero and they succeed with this. Both actors are solid actors and no cringe worthy moments between them arises.Good action movie, a bit juvenile at times but thats okey i think, this is not a deep thriller but good fun and good action and an okey story well worth the money if you just drop your preconceptions from former movies and realise that this is a new film.",Men in Black - International
427,musiqliblessed,The ending failed to deliver...,5,23 September 2021,"It appears they ran out of money or something. The film built up to an ending that barely managed scratch the itch.The really cool twin aliens (Les Twins) very unceremoniously disappeared from the rest of the film after the big reveal about their characters.The finale just had no steam. It was rushed and anti-climatic.It certainly had some good moments, because like I said, great cast. Bunch of winning personalities involved. I def loved the hammer moment with Chris Hemsworth. Nice nod and fun-poker at Hemsworth's long-running portrayal of Thor. But even his performance and excellent improv skills seemed stifled at times.Les Twins are incredible and it was delightful to see them make a blockbuster debut.This was, unfortunately, just a very unfortunate attempt to revive the franchise. They had all the makings...great cast, good solid storyline, but it just seems like production had some failures and they couldn't see the whole thing through to completion.",Men in Black - International
428,redn_path01,"""Hmm."" I think this sums it up.",6,21 August 2019,"Giving it 6 out of 10 stars mostly because three or four alien designs were interesting.
Not because the story is good, because it is quite terrible. The actors did their best with the script they were given, and both of the main characters are likeable in spite of the dialog that was written for them. With less skilled actors, this would have been a lot worse.Most of the scenes with the very annoying (and at times badly composited!) comical relief tiny alien pawn are so dumb that I'm imagining kids are gonna like this movie. Small kids. Toddlers maybe? Fetuses? The less brain cells, the better.On the other hand there are bits that hint at wanting to appeal to a more mature audience and it falls short on achieving that goal.Very noticable, very drawn-out product placements throughout the movie. Especially for that Lexus car in the end. Felt like a TV commercial.As a fan of harder scifi, this is probably classifiable as torture. Aliens and tech are used just how you would imagine magic to work. Fantastical ""stuff"" doing ""stuff"". There is no science to the scifi. None. Basically Harry Potter but with a different visual skin applied!But then again, the movie is also not even making the faintest attempt at explaining anything, and thus avoids further embarrassments.Watch it if you like the actors.",Men in Black - International

Chris Hemsworth gets to have all the fun with his cocky ""Agent H"", while Tessa Thompson is forced to play the ""straight man"" throughout. Kumail Nanjiani's ""Pawny"" is really what makes this watchable.The supporting cast is largely stale, and I can guarantee you that anyone over the age of 6 can guess who the mole is in MIB. While it does nothing to elevate the genre or give me any interest in seeing a sequel, it felt very much like an early-2000's action comedy and very much felt like it took place in the MIB world.

432,rich-874-542858,Missed the point,4,24 May 2020,"Men In Black (1997) was great because it tackled the sci-fi and alien genre with (mostly) dry wit. It pitted two opposite characters against each other, who were both equally capable in their respective ways.This film has missed the point altogether. The infantile humour is practically spelled out in subtitles for you, the story has no real direction or threat. The lead characters worked well together in Thor because they had great direction and a great story, which was lacking here.Neither character is believable, and the abundance of technology available to them diminishes the threat of the supervillain.It's an entertaining film to have on when you want to switch your brain off for a bit but that's about the best that can be said of it.

But that wasn't the case, honestly. There was character development with Agent H learning he doesn't have to work alone, and Agent M learning to trust her gut. There was a lot of avoided cliché moments that could've come with two people of the opposite sex working together, like needless jealousy and undeserved flirting. Agent H and Agent M actually had motivations for how they interacted with each other. Not to mention their characters weren't that cliché or stereotypical either. Like Agent H wasn't just reckless and arrogant, he was actually caring and passionate. Plus the two main characters didn't fall in love! Which is refreshing because it wasn't necessary!The cons were that while the pacing of the story was fine, the pacing within the scenes was a bit too slow which gave the feeling that it was overstaying its welcome a bit. If most of the scenes were a bit faster paced, then it would feel like a sleeker and smoother movie. And the villains were a bit one note and could've been established better.But overall, it was a really enjoyable movie. The acting was great, the characters were likable, and the little alien dude Pawney was actually pretty funny. 8/10.",Men in Black - International

This movie just fell flat uninteresting and boring. Even the plot of the movie was copied from previous men in black movies. Chris Hemsworth tried to be funny and guffy which failed on so many levels. All you get is the same punch lines that you have already seen in the Thor movies but the only difference is he is not playing Thor. Tessa Thompson who plays agent M is a forgetable character that I don't even know why she was a main character to begin with in the movie...say it with me.... Men in Black... not women who likes to wear black shiny suits.

441,RobertWhitebrow,Passive-aggressive quips do not equate to comedy gold. Who would have known?,3,26 June 2020,"This installment is by a large margin the worst of the MiB franchise and hopefully the last one. The writers have apparently dried up on the ideas front as multiple scenes in this one are plucked directly from the previous movies. The cast is not at all capable of demonstrating any chemistry, let alone anything up to the standard set up by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. The plot is forced and the events move ""because the script said so"" often lacking logic or clear motivation. The characters are mostly caricatures with none of them having to go through any character development or growth. The particular offender here is the lead female who, to contrast Will Smith's character, is a genius from birth, can just walk up to a super secret organization and get recruited and in general everything goes her way just because. Aside from ""let's have one with women in it!"" agenda I really do not see why this one is made. The movie makes me wonder when will the writers learn to write good female characters without shoving silly feminist lines in the audience's faces. But hey, ""women are all queens"" as the lead tells us directly. What? Aren't you amused and entertained yet?",Men in Black - International

It's an enjoyable watch, I loved the both Thompson ladies :) Pawny was hilarious. I'm not a fan of Chris Hensworth, I'll say he was decent. I was disappointed, though, that there were no cameos by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, I think many were expecting something.",Men in Black - International

447,arskhemnanilack,Men In Black: International - 5/10,5,19 June 2019,"Clearly, there aren't many good things about the movie based on the rating. So I guess I'll just start with what I actually enjoyed about the movie. Firstly, Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth did a great job with these roles, you can tell that they really tried and were definetely fun characters throughout the 2 hour runtime. Second, Kumal Nanjiani, who is definitely coming up in Hollywood, kills his role as ""Pawny"" and is easily the best part of the film, making it funny and lighthearted. That's just about all I have to say that's good about it, now onto what I didn't like. The story takes too long to setup, leaving behind forgetful and unimportant scenes once it does actually setup. The villain in this movie is atrocious, they only fight him/it once throughout the entire movie, although it's wherever the main characters are throughout most of it. The villains feel like they're just dragging and always lead to nothing or serve no purpose in just about all of the scenes they were a part of. It almost feels as if the movie's runtime was too short and there could've been a lot more. There are a couple scenes where the characters mess up and do things that could potentially cause a huge issue, but we don't even see that. There are multiple scenes in which they show aliens or alien tech carelessly to the outside world after knowing and saying that it shouldn't be shown at all, and it causes no effect. If you do watch this movie, there's a certain scene and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about when you see it. Overall, I still credit Men In Black: International for being entertaining and fun throughout if you're just looking for something to hold you over until Toy Story 4 or Spider-Man: Far From Home.",Men in Black - International

Quite unimaginative.The big twist was almost hilariously obvious from a very early stage.The good things are: it's got a high production value, good CGI, in fact good chemistry between the leads even though Hemsworth's character is unbearable at times and a few well timed jokes.The best part of the movie was one fight scene in which the transition between the two different fights was very cleverly done and quite cool.To sum it up, this is basically a movie that doesn't offend anybody but neither dares anything new.

There are certainly some minor jabs at ""Men"" In Black in humorous way, but I think it's unnecessary & counter productive to the movie. The movie plots itself pretty much detached from all of that. Maybe Sony & the movie makers just can't help themselves I guess . . .
idk, sometimes they preach all the ""good"" things, but when it comes to reality more often we find the hypocrisy . . .",Men in Black - International
458,annie421,"Predictable, fun, unnecessary reboot",5,14 June 2019,"I love the OG MIB series. So when I first heard they were making this, I had the same reaction that I did when I saw the trailer for Jurassic World. ""Eh... looks dumb but I'll watch it."" Much like my reaction, that movie was dumb but it was watchable.This one does a few things right
1. It keeps the irreverent nature of the original.
2. Opening the MIB world up was fun because we saw hints of the world wide operation in the original movies.
3. Tessa Tomopson and Chris hemsworth have good chemistry. That was proven in Thor 3. It's still there, the friendly kind of flirty banter.
4. I like that they brought back Emma Tompson.
5. There's a little bit of a twist that I didn't see coming. Now that I think about it, it should have been obvious but I think that was nicely done. I think the thing that sold it was Chris Hemsworth's acting here. You could tell something was off but you didn't know what. I actually thought they might make him the mole and then this movie would have been completely bonkers but I would have loved it. But seeing how damaging neurolizng someone can be.Things that wouldn't bother most people but they kind of bothered me
1. The lazy writing.
-I knew from the beginning that agent C wasn't the mole. I love Rafe Spall and he actually has been one of my favorite Brit actors since Shaun of the Dead, and he did the best he could with the material he was given.
-Also, agent M and the therapy thing, it's such a trope. She's smart and dedicated and she was right! I dunno... and then when she first approached H, because of the whole comedic slow down thing, it looked like she approached him cause he was hot and not because he was the best agent- I mean this is a debatable point because I figured it out but the last bits with the lingering looks? Ehhh
2. Men in Black- it's in the freaking intro speech! I get that they only neurolize people and maybe aliens have different rules but I don't know how I felt about Chris hemsworth in clothes that weren't MIB standards. I mean it doesn't have to be a suit and tie necessarily, several of the women costumes are still black and white but with flair. Even Agent M wears these heeled boots. (I know that's probably practical because of the height difference but still, very cool) this is nit picky I know, but it's a little thing that I think holds true to the style of the first movies.3. The wall of world saving - I know that on a cinematic point of view if you only have two, it simplifies things and we are left with iconic movie images but the MIB as an organization has saved the world more then that. I think if the production had a few more of different off screen adventures, maybe tying in the cartoon or even the original comics? Again nit picky but I think there's a missed opportunity4. The rom com angle. - no they didn't kiss, but I don't know... it felt kind of unnecessary.5. Wasted villains- technically the twins are still villains because they did kill a lot. (even if they were doing it for a right reason) i dunno... it felt like there could have been more done..some kind of fallout for MIB killing ""innocent"" aliens?I could go on building a pros and cons list but in the end it would always even out. All in all it was a fun shallow movie that kept the irreverent spirit of the original, falling apart a little. If they do make a sequel, I do hope they bring it back to NY and see if J and K are willing to come back.",Men in Black - International
459,Justinpren,RIP Will Smith,1,23 June 2019,"It's such a shame but this movie has a big zero percent of the brilliance of the last 3.

The acting was great and the script was well done, and again not great but good. Steve's part was very well played and gave a comic relief to the more serious parts of the movie.
I do like that the agency was infiltrated by one dedicated woman and O's return to the series was excellent. The ending was nice, and the movie locations were well done.

He start to remember his past civil life and looks suppressed by the circumstances.In new film (2019) you got NONE of this. Main character just granted everything, for the beautiful eyes. No competition, no sacrifice, she doesn't even care about police job (what MIB actually are)! Wth? Ex-Tor is a stupid forgetful boy with poor jokes .. and that's all? Where the comparison with real life? Anything?Slow-mo, CGI, mutants.. a lot of plagiarism even on itself! (not nostalgia, but cliche). Eh. The worst episodes of cartoon series Rick n Morty are so, unbelievably better than this.. that I found it offensive.

470,ismaellavallee,A lot of these reviews were generous with their ratings,4,25 June 2019,"So here's my take on all this. A lot of reviews saying this was overly girl power and the main character is a sexist Mary Sue. She did show flaws here and there so it wasn't as bad as captain marvel. And they let Hemsworth be right sometimes, saying she's never been in love before. And maybe she should loosen up. BUT that's where it ends. There is no development for her in that area. She remains the same, not learning any valuable lesson. Instead she ""learns how the universe works"". Which she does this by going into a wormhole and coming out in slow motion as if this is some moment of clarity. It's really not. There is no explanation for her ""revelation"". All great actors but the characters were bad. Except for Pawny. Kumail Nanjiani did great, funny as always, even when given a slightly cringey character. The CGI was absolutely gorgeous. It was very lifelike. Those two things is want merits stars out of my rating. But I think the most annoying and ridiculous part of it. Is how Agent M knows everything about every piece of alien tech she touches. I understand she is suppose to be smart. But this is not something she learned in any school. And it's nothing she's ever encountered before. They could have at least done a montage of her doing some kind of training to explain this. But no she's fresh off the boat and already knows everything alien. Terrible.",Men in Black - International

She sometimes comes off as annoying, but really, so what? She still goes through a journey, makes choices, wins and loses. Yes, it is easier to find her annoying, but easier is not always the best, remember!The movie has active protagonists, a worthy antagonist, and even some old school deux ex machina!

493,battlecrusadersgames,Franchise is officially dead,5,27 June 2019,"While watching this movie, i was trying to pick out things i liked that i could list here as positives. I found this a highly difficult task, as most of it, really isn't that good. Actually the fact i was even doing this, letting my mind wander, instead of being gripped by the movie, shows how bad it was.The story, is way too complex to explain here and certainly for a comedy movie. The acting, is ok i guess, but the only actor who seems to have the same screen presence as Will Smith is Liam Neeson and he is greatly underused. I think if we had more on screen time with Hemsworth and Neeson together, we might have had more magical moments like we did with Smith and Lee Jones.Now to the humour, or better said, the lack of it. The movie just isn't funny, i laughed once, the whole way through and i think the reason for this isn't because they didn't try to put jokes in, they just put them in the wrong place. The writers of this should remember, it's ok to have serious parts and even scary parts in a comedy movie. Take Ghostbusters for example. The problem with this is, any of those moments where the story can take an intriguing twist, are lost because of the forced humour.One last negative critisism is Hemsworth's false English accent. Being English myself, i can genuinely say i have never met any English person that talks like that. It's 2019 Chris, not 1919 and Thor is not in Men in Black.There are some positives here, there's a nice plot twist at the end and as i said Nesson is great. Plus the alien twins played by the Bourgeois Brothers adds a darkness this movie really needs. Sadly everything else isn't. For me, this has killed off the series. Please no more sequels unless Smith comes back.",Men in Black - International

497,hilarylang,Pretty horrible,10,30 June 2019,"Alright, buckle in for this messy ramble of a review. At 1:00 AM, I tried to explain the entire movie to my sister, and in doing this, I realized that the world needs to know this information. I'll just get this out, right away. I hated the movie. I feel like the only reason I stayed was because I came there with a friend. Now, this is coming from someone who loves to watch bad movies for a good laugh. The Bee Movie may be awful, but at least you have fun watching it. MIB International was not even that. It somehow managed to be boring and cringy. Overall, it was just intolerable. Okay, I should probably get into specifics.
1.Dialogue and Acting
I can't say for sure if all these actors are bad actors. Actually, I know that the main roles are pretty good actors, so it really comes down to the actual dialogue. None of the dialogue sounds natural in any way. I can think of several lines of dialogue that makes me want to claw out my eyes and plug my ears with them. But for time sake, I won't point them out.
2.Characters
Now I know that Mary Sue is a dead term, but honestly it's probably the only term to describe Agent M. She's supposed to be a super cool chick, who's also edgy, but also clumsy, but also quirky. She just doesn't really have much to her. Moving onto Agent H, whom I hate even more. The character trope that they try to achieve is ""Lovable jerk"" which isn't an inherently bad trope. A lot of writers can pull it off and create some of my favorite characters. However, they wrote him horribly. And finally, Pawny. Whom of course, I hate the most. It's like they tried to create their own minion, and Minions still did it better. He's supposed to be the comic relief pet creature thing. It's done horribly. Everything he did, made me want to leave the theater. They all were supposed to be funny, yet none of them were. And I'm saying that as a person who occasionally laughs at fart jokes. I don't have a sophisticated sense of humor. It just wasn't funny. It was more cringy than anything.
3.Conclusion
Overall, great movie. 10/10",Men in Black - International

509,cupofsoulshow,Misuse of Talent,5,11 July 2019,"Men In Black was initially introduced to us in 1997 starring the iconic Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. It's 2019, and we have a new dynamic duo, Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth.Thompson is an alien conspiracy follower, and Hemsworth is the good-looking super-agent Agent H representing the international wing of the agency. His mentor Agent High T embodied by Liam Neeson is the man in charge.They are still chasing extra-terrestrials that threaten the sanctity of mother earth, but this time the threat is internal as well. The agency has a mole.There were high expectations for Men in Black International. Thompson is coming off the success of Creed 2 and Hemsworth of the juggernaut known as The Avengers. They first worked together in the hit Thor- Ragnarok so one would think that they would strike magic again. Sadly No.The issue with this movie is that the plot is all over the place. We have two great actors with great comedic timing that were given this common theme. The film opens with a daring mission in Paris and then pivots to Agent M childhood. Young Molly embodied by Mandeiya Flory first sees the Men In Black twenty years ago during her first contact with an alien, since then she's been obsessed with joining the agency. Back in the future, she finally locates the elusive group and is given a chance to prove herself by Agent O played by the charming Emma Thompson. The interaction between Thompson and Thompson were one of the better parts of the movie. The joy of finally getting fitted for that black jacket meant everything to Molly.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't continue this euphoric ride. Men In Black International has an opportunity to create great comedic moments just like its predecessor however the script never takes advantage of the enthusiastic spirit of Agent M and the boisterous self-indulgent Agent H. The jokes are flat and predictable. One minute we're looking for a killer, then a mole inserted with agent H enemies coming back to haunt him. It's dizzying just typing all the events; hence, the audience never connects to these characters. Kumail Nanjiani was added as Pawny to bring additional comedic relief, but even he can't save this film. I was delighted to see dance icons Les Twins make their screen debut, but they too deserved better.So let's review you have Tessa Thompson, Chris Hemsworth, Emma Thompson, Kumail Nanjiani and Liam Neeson yet Men In Black International still is dismal. The blame for that are screenwriters Matt Holloway and Art Marcum. They never managed to understand who these characters are instead built a script on cheap jokes sprinkled in with fake feminism. F. Gary Gray attempted despite the above to cut and piece together a fun ride, but it's hard when the foundation is shaky. This is one time where special effect and star power doesn't translate into a winner.If you want to see a better connection between Thompson and Hemsworth watch Thor Ragnarok. Men In Black International was an idea that needed to stay on paper.Diversity: This movie gets a 5 for Tessa Thompson and Emma Thompson. Kumail Nanjiani was also cast, but he plays a pawn.Scale: This movie receives a 5 for messiness",Men in Black - International

511,Stenun,A comedy in desperate search of a joke,3,16 June 2019,"I watched this film in a half-full cinema screen and nobody laughed. At all. Not just ""none of the people I was with laughed"" but there was no laughter from anyone in the whole cinema at any point. The film was so obviously and desperately trying to be funny but it never made it. Without the charisma of Will Smith and his ability to deliver funny lines, the script's flaws were exposed as his replacements just do not have his comedic presence and really need better material than this to get laughs. The action was tepid, the inventiveness was barely there, the humour was utterly absent. Avoid. Let's hope they bring back Will Smith for the next one.",Men in Black - International

Being an original fan of the first trilogy of the MIB, I wasn't blown away by this movie and no the charismatic leads couldn't hold a candle to Will and Tommy, but I DO WANT TO SEE THEM GROW INTO THESE ROLES.Tessa and Chris had some good chemistry and the lines they were given were passable at best, but they did their best with what they had and exceeded the script. And their charisma was there too, obviously only bits of it, and I like Pawny/Steven, I think he's just as good as Pug from the originals. Giving them time, I guarantee they can keep this Ip alive and even give it a chance for this generation.The movie itself I felt kept all the attributes from the originals, of course there were newer things also. The world is still entertaining and so were the supporting roles. Only thing that disservice this movie is the boring plot, which I think they can easily overcome the next one especially with the oversea success of this one.",Men in Black - International

When I woke up, I watched the second half. Overall, it is a blockbuster, so it has some entertainment value but quality, well that is a different story.The good parts of the movie: (1) the humor of Chris Hemmsworth's character, (2) new characters - they did not try to explain away TLJ or Will Smith's absence which was actually refreshing in movies these days which try too hard to explain why someone is not in the movie, (3) chemistry between Chris Hemmsworth and Tessa Thompson, (4) Liam Neeson because he just makes everything better.Bad parts of the movie: (1) the plot - if you have seen the previous MIB then you basically know the plot of this one, (2) Tessa Thompson's character - basically picture a new employee showing up one day and being better than all other employees, with no training, and this employee pretty much isn't phased by anything, (3) Pawny (Kunail) - provides comedic relief but too much of it is forced and a lit of the jokes don't land, (4) the villain(s) - really this is about their absence, I knew as much about them in the first two minutes as I did at the end of the movie, which is nothing, (5) Liam Neeson - great he is in the movie, that makes it better, dang it he really isn't too involved and the character is well basically a shell, devoid of pretty much anything (ie emotion, storyline, etc), (6) Lingering Questions - right off the bat, throughout the movie you hear how Chris Hemmsworth's character has changed, but do you ever find out why, I would say no - they explain an event which happened, but that does not explain a change in a character's entire behavior even causing an alien not to trust him, so if anyone can explain this, I would love to know.As you can see, the bad out numbers the good 6-4, but I still gave it 5 out of 10 stars. Why, well when you watch these films, you can't expect too much and it delivered slightly above my expectations. Additionally, it was somewhat enjoyable film, and really that is all that matters. This isn't a best picture film, so I'm not going to rate it based on those standards.",Men in Black - International

Although too old, this was the type of role made for Hugh Grant.And the plot had all of the originality of a third-grader's essay on ""What I Did Last Summer"".In the first MIB, the weapons didn't play a big part of the film, while Hemsworth pulls his if he hears a cricket chirp.The acting is horrible, the plot is a dud, and the roles have no character.

I understand that MIB has quite dumb plot, but it isn't the main thing. The thing is atmosphere. OK, this is my fault too. There isn't a single four in the title and nothing about Will Smith.So, what can I say about different sides of the movie?Cast. You can hate me, but it's weak. Not the actors - cast. There are good actors in the film. Liam Neeson, Chris Hemsworth, Rebecca Ferguson for example. But for most of them it isn't their roles. But for most of them it is not their roles. I like Liam Neeson and Rebecca Ferguson - but there are so little with them. The star of the movie - Chris Hemsworth. And... this isn't MiB. This is James Bond with Thor.Plot. It isn't the bad side of the movie.This is typical story about MiB. With bad implementation. I have four main claims to the plot:1. So quick and radical change of locations. Then I saw word ""International"" and shut up.2. The main heroine - Agent M (Tessa Thompson). Girl, that all her life dreaming about being part of MiB, behaves as if it another job in office. Aliens, new technologies, new worlds! No. She is interested only in Agent H (Chris Hemsworth). Do you remember first MiB and first time of Will Smith in headquarters? That was surprising and interesting. But here Agent M can have all she wants at one moment!3. Some scenes. Get me right. There is 1 h 54 min and if you cut about 30-40 minutes, you get the same movie. Some scenes more adjust to adventure film about spies. A crime lord. A night club. Besides, few scenes are so long, that I had a good nap. And after all that understand plot!4. Humor. Yes, there are jokes, but they so uninteresting... that I can't remember any. And we have one joke about Thor (how amazing!), but it good only for fansSo, we have a fake MiB.

I see that screenplay team understand how spin-off titles should look. All that u need - some changes.
First - characters. They're different compared to original guys by a gender reason and by their mood.
Men In Black which we can see are not playing in contrast way. Both of them are young and funny. Agent H (Hamsworth) is a self-asured experienced agent who just does his work with a nice smile on face.
Agent M (Thompson) is a curious girl which wanna know all secrets of the Universe.
And Liam Neeson as boss of London Department of MiB.
Second - setting. MiB universe is bigger now. In MiB International H and M will travel through all world except American and british departments.

The story line was interesting enough to hold one's attention, with a twist at the end that I did not see coming. Plenty of humor to go around - maybe not Smith/Jones level, but then again, what else would be?Of course, the social narrative had to be injected, but at least it was only two small parts. There was a little convsersation of how hard it was to get this organization, forever known as the MEN in Black since it's inception, to change it's name just because they also have female agents.Then there was this brilliant little piece of completely unnecessary writing:Pawnee (to Agent M): Are you a queen?

There are some interesting special effects but their best agent appears to be a fall down drunk our new young agent has to help along. We're fooled into thinking the wrong way until the end which is the ONLY truly interesting aspect and IS good.

559,ericsavage,Missed opportunity,5,3 July 2019,"There's so much you can do with sci-fi and humour, and both Guardians of the Galaxy movies are pathfinders in this genre. MIBI has its funny moments, but you walk away unfulfilled.I thought Tessa Thompson might bring a nice quirky offering to the mix, but instead she took the mean feminist role - the know-it-all who was suddenly able to fix space-age bikes within a day of joining the team ... come on!. Again, a missed opportunity. There was a real chance to do what Spiderman did with Toby Maguire and give the audience a much more in-depth exploration into the first-timer's discovery of this wonderful universe and the skills required to be a man in black.After the movie I watched the trailer again and it doesn't lie - the movie really is that bland - perhaps they could have brought some comedians in to spice up the script?",Men in Black - International
560,JaeBianca,Chris Hemsworth &Tessa Thompson have great chemistry,7,26 April 2020,"I enjoyed MIB:International for the lighthearted fluff it's meant to be. I saw the 1st MIB when it came out, and 20+ years later Siobhahn Fallon's performance is my most consistently hilarious memory of the series. I am fairly certain that I saw MIB2, but I know for sure that I never watched MIB3. My only interest in MIB:International was seeing if CH and TT were as fun to watch as in Thor:Ragnarok, and the answer is yes! Their comedic chemistry is such that it is as easy to see her climb him like a tree and turn him into her sex slave, as it is to just see them bro it out. They play so well together that I hope they become the kind of acting team that just chooses fun opportunities to work together.",Men in Black - International

Story was good & writers gave everyone great lines to make this movie funny and entertaining but still serious business as an MIB.
The story plays out very smoothly and easy to understand. My kids 10 & 13 really liked it.
No need to watch previous MIB movies to enjoy this one. It's a story of its own & it works.

562,Mix3n19,Men in black or girl in black ??!,2,5 September 2019,"Watching the movie with friends, I heard questions like when it will end, the most due to a badly written script that stupefied wontons, which extended unnecessary parts of the production to shorten the outline of the plot. From the technical side, we will watch not the worst shots of you from the photos, but some brilliant music is not and does not attract to production. The acting in this movie was mixed, because the roles were played quite naturally, but with a bit of acting, which did not knock down but can be assessed more positively than negatively.",Men in Black - International

You feel as though you've seen it a hundred times. The funniest character is a chess piece while the two main characters are pretentious and boring. The potential was there, but this movie has a very basic and uninteresting storyline. You can almost predict what is going to happen shot for shot. There isn't much to say about this film because not much happened. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a bad movie, but it isn't a good one either. There are some fun action sequences, and some cool looking gadgets, but that's about it. Men in Black: International is a solid 3/10.",Men in Black - International

This was a fresh approach to a successful concept. There were some slow moments in the beginning I admit that didn't quite fit in but overall the acting, plot and special effects were good. Go see it with an open mind and this movie stands up solidly with the rest of the franchise.",Men in Black - International
565,Wikingking,"If it was the pilot of an MIB series, it would be close to 10",6,24 October 2019,"The headline says it all: if this movie was a pilot of a mini or regular series about MIB with this cast, I'd say it's a pretty good opening. As a kind of follow-up to the trilogy featuring Will Smith and TLJ, it is sort of letdown-ish.Nothing serious though. In a world of hopeless and mindless reboot/remake/prequel/sequel making, this spin-off+sequel does something exceptionall important, many other titles fail to achieve: it does not ruin the original, not a single bit. Strange, that I need to applaud such ""feat"", but it is what it is. When legendary characters like Han Solo is being butchered from left and right, when great standalone movies got horrible sequels that were totally uncalled for and still ending in cliffhangers (like Independence Day 2), this film stands out.It features a new duo of agents, the smart and adroit Agent M (Tessa Thompson) and the very annoying yet somehow legendary Agent H (Chris Hemsworth). Chemistry between them is no big deal, the story is kind of basic and pretty predictable (there is a mole in the Agency), the action sequences are plenty and kind of mediocre, humor is a mix of cute and tiring. Supporting cast has some big names like Liam Neeson, Rebecca Ferguson and Emma Thompson.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the original MIB and can maintain only a decent amount of expectation towards this movie and also to anyone who likes sci-fi action/comedy movies. It's not a boring one, but not memorable by any means. It just works.

Sterile and formulaic with cardboard characters and questionable attempts at ""humor"" that you can tell from a mile away, and still not able to produce any human emotion, all together it made me suspect the only alien presence about this movie was its script writes.
A special note I have long made for myself which can hopefully help someone save an evening is a lame movie trying to rely on some sort of ""international"" flair.

The next issue i have is political correctness has been shoved down our throats. It makes me sick to the stomach that so many movies are going in this direction these days. Hollywood is dead to me.
I can see now why theres no mediocre reviews. People either love it with a 10/10 or hate it with a low score like 1 or 2/10.

Does Hollywood has no decent script writers ans scripts that is trying so desperately to cash on past glories? (SONY, Columbia, don't care which studio) And it is no more men, now it is men and women. New agent, yeah, new partner, how politically correct are we. Did #MeToo made some phone calls while the cast was selected? Tessa, at least pump some muscle girl, U R a doll but U still look like Valkyrie in The Avengers and Thor. A black suit and a pair of shades don't make U a ... er ... a Woman In Black? And man, all that rap, rap, lousy rap music. Annoying. Will was much better. His was good.
Rip Torn is dead, so let's shift to good old faithful England (switch in a moment to the Middle East to please someone) and pull Liam Neeson, he looks like a trustworthy character and an action guy. Gee, he's Irish, well it don't matter for this case. Emma Thompson (she's Brit alright) probably did this for some cash and so did Gary, probably. Dude U were great directing The Negotiator and The Italian Job. Why this? And Chris, stick to what U R really good at man, OK Thor?
They tried to make it so funny that it wasn't funny. Too many anticipated cliches. It was boring despite some lotsa CGI action. Too much.
I don't see the Academy talking about Cedric's designed statuette for this ... Men & Women In Black all over the World.

But that is far from true. Sure, some of the acting is a little bit on the bad side, but look at the first MiB, that hardly had stellar acting from all involved.Ignore the negativity.

It kind of seems illogical that it makes a difference on the person's gender on weather or not they're a spot-on person. And it's been a little while since I watch this.

There is nothing new that you haven't already seen. Ok, maybe one thing that has to do with a beard.Overall, the movie is as bland as porridge. It doesn't have soul.

There wasn't one genuine attention grabbing moment in the entire 2 hours,Chris is charming, but his performance was shallow, Agent H was more like a playboy than hero. Tessa is supposed to be the new girl power that is a breath of fresh air into the man dominated world. It'd be great, except we have seen nothing of the sort. She didn't demonstrate wittiness, resolve, mental or physical strength to be the new generation of agent that the show is supposed to deliver. Her performance overall is blend.The screen play was badly written, ladled with holes bigger than the galaxy. Directing was so bad.

I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed, the visuals were really good and the fact that they showed even show more kind of aliens that we haven't seen before was really nice. But the story..... the story was just not as good as you think it is going to be, you can expect and piece everything together like half an hour before the characters themselves do.
Also, there are a lot of plot points that they show but they are not explaining them fully and you just don't understand what is the point of these plot points... the editing was also not great, the movie moves fast but there are a lot of scenes that they cut before the scene ends and then they never come back to them which is annoying because those scenes are sometimes really important to the story. I also didn't really like Chris Hemsworth's character because he say's a joke every like 3 minutes and most of his jokes are unfortunately not funny.So in conclusion, if you are looking for a fun action adventure then you can watch this because it does have some good action scenes and some of the jokes are pretty funny, But, because of the bad story and the bad editing I wouldn't recommend to pay money to see this, just wait for it to come out on vod or dvd.

They were great in Ragnarok and their small amount of screen time in Endgame too. For this film the chemistry is still there but they are trying to hold up a franchise that was never in need of a reboot. I say reboot but really the film follows many of the formulas the previous 3 did. When I was watching it i can't remember being bored but similarly writing this review a few hours later and I can't really say I remember much that happened.
Chris Hemsworth is a dependable as ever, he seems to have decided to keep the Thor accent too for this film. Tessa Thompson equally holds he own, and as I've said the chemistry between the two is pretty good. Liam Neeson plays the elder well and Emma Thompson's few scenes are competent, though don't really test her as an actor. There's a few decent laughs mainly from the alien Pawny (voiced by Kumail Nanjiani). Overall though the script doesn't allow any of the actors to really take this film in a different direction from the others.
There lots of action, little in the way of story, a twist that is blatantly obvious before the film really even starts & an ending which may leave the door open for more, but the question is do we need or want more?",Men in Black - International
597,gabe-09926,Mediocre compared to orig. But still fun to watch,5,6 September 2019,"Summary: MIB Int. is a visual spectacle that is part of the 4k UHD push. Action sequences are amazing and CG looks spectacular. For fans that grew up with the original MIB franchise they may find the comedy to be medicore at best where younger gens. may find it more humorous. Although the film lacks the depth of MIB 1, it does a good job of introducing us a the new vision of MIB World. The actors do fine job portraying their characters however the script is only average-to juvenille. Aside from negatives I enjoyed the film, but not enough to buy or add to my MIB collection.Low Notes: In my opinion the biggest miss with MIB Int. is that it does not do a good job of establishing the relationship chemistry of the parnter duo that MIB had done. MIB Int. highlights the differences between the two agents but fails at showing us that they have an actual friendship. As the old movies go, 'you only have one partner and you'll do anything for your partner.' This element seemed to be missing. In my opinion, the directors chose to install to many 'cool' action scenes than have scenes devoted to character development. Keep in mind, MIB part 1 had the least amount of action of all the films but this turns out to be the best one. The same could be said for many other action film franchises. A proper story always wins over spectacale. MIB 1 had the right balance of story and action where MIB int. is more concerned with laughs and action.High Notes: They show dedication plaque of agents K and J to honor the original MIB agents. Although some of the jokes are in the outplayed 'smartass cynical jokes' of todays younger gen. there are some laughable moments. The ones that are not as funny are at least amusing and keep the comedic atmoshere alive. Of course the 4k UHD combined with todays CG abilities provide some cool visual effects that most will be pleased with. For those with HT audio, the sound effects sound excellent.
Some things that didnt make sense: Agent M, a rookie agent with no military/firearm training and no understanding of the alien world, minus her encounter as a child, is suddenly a pro operating alien weaponary. She also suddenly understands complex alien tech like with the 'Big Gun' in the film.In the original films they explain in order to be an agent you have to be ""The best of the best...with honors"" and the line up included the top men in the marines, navy, army etc.(although agent J was street cop, we eventually find out why he was selected in MIB3).Additionally, I wasnt exactly sure how Agent O is allowed to decide who the head MIB London is when she is the head of MIB(USA). I would think MIB London is organized enough to handle their own affairs, after all that would be out of her jurisdiction.",Men in Black - International

There is simply no charm as there was in Will Smith, Josh Brolin or Tommy Lee Jones. Liam Neeson is good, as always, but his role is equivalent to a spread-out cameo. Even worse is the casting of Tessa Thompson. Why the hell would anyone cast her into this role? I believe she isn't even a great actor anyways. On top of that, stupid feminist propaganda is shoved down our throats in this movie, disguised as lame jokes. The CGI is nothing special either. Cinematography is bad as is the soundtrack. Just because Chris worked great as Thor, doesn't means he is fit or he can simply just fit into the roles of three all-time great actors. For god's sake, MIB is a movie loved and cherished by millennials, so why not aim it at us, instead of aiming at the young (and dumb, no offense) generation that is today's.All in all, there is nothing good about this film. I literally wanted to walk out mid-way through the film - it is that bad! Maybe some kids in their early teenage years might like it, that too if they haven't seen any of the previous movies.It is a sequel nobody ever asked for, and least of all, expected. It's just another one of those cash grab stupid lame ass sequels which aim to ride, blatantly and shamelessly, on the success and name of their prequels. The film crew was just too cynical to pay attention to any part of the movie. It feels like a half-baked cake served with partially-whipped cream and topped with a dry cherry.",Men in Black - International

The sequels were more CGI action than writing. More convoluted plots and more 'hey look who is in this movie' stuff. This installment is no different. Loud CGI fest with a story that is so all over the place it doesn't know what it is. I think with a better writer/director and less actiony stuff this could have been a decent film.

Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson have been shown to have great comedic timing in Thor Ragnarok, but in this movie you can't see the same chemistry.

631,RyaanKiing,Nothing memorable,6,15 October 2019,"To start it off, the usual run down with sequels such as these... Do you need to watch the others before watching this? Not really no. It does help with understanding the world of Men in Black, the weapons/tools and any easter eggs but not essential.Men in Black: International does a great job of knowing where it stands in terms of genre, it's not a full-blown action film nor is it a non-stop comedy. This sits perfectly in the middle making a light-hearted, family-friendly film. It has plenty of comedic areas but knows when to throw a slightly serious scene in, creating quite a nice blend of emotions. This was the same as the other three films and it still hits the spot with Men in Black: International. Adding and improving an already built universe is no easy task, most sequel films will fail at doing it and instead ruin the franchise. But Men in Black: International does a fantastic job of bringing in new characters, new bases, new technology and mixing them together with original assets. Basically, the franchise improves with this film, you get me?Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson have strong chemistry throughout, they bounce off each other. It almost comes off as a buddy cop friendship, you have one more seasoned agent and one newly graduated agent. The humour, fight scenes and general dialogue are shared well between the two. You do feel like they are just playing themselves which is great, natural performances are sure winners in my eyes and you don't seem to get a lot of it these days.A downside I have with Men in Black: International is that although the film is thoroughly enjoyable, there isn't really a memorable scene. There isn't a standout scene which you'll think about whenever someone says ""Have you seen Men in Black: International?"" nothing unique will come to mind. Does a film necessarily need a standout scene? No, but it does help, it reinforces it in your memory and you will be recommending people to watch it when you think about that standout scene.Just to throw in at the end... why oh why can't Will Smith have a song at the end of Men in Black: International? why can't he just be in it as well? There are probably a bunch of reasons why none of these can be true but it still hurts that he is nowhere to be seen (minus easter eggs ;)) so prepare yourself for this prior to watching.P.S - There is no after credits scene.",Men in Black - International

This is far from the worst MIB movie, it's actually my second favorite of the four, with MIB3 being #1 and MIB2 being dead last.

There are so many things about it that are off. 70% of the movie are useless scenes that seem more like a compilation of funny moments and not like a movie with an actual plot. Power dynamics are completely off. Nothing about the movie is serious. Characters are joking and at times it feels more like impro theatre than a movie about saving the world.

655,tiwaz_2k,Better than MIB3,7,17 June 2019,"Review(spoiler free): Men In Black: InternationalShort version - You have to make it through the 1/2 half to get to the good parts in the second half. Despite it's flaws it is still a fun movie to see once. Stronger appeal for teens despite the original is older than they are.
Good enough that another is worth making and still room to top this one. I am looking forward to Tessa continuing the role or this being a stepping stone to bigger things for her.Long versionEmma Thompson - perfectChris Helmsworth is almost type cast with the swagger of a roguish playboy struggling with a secret inner-demon. But he is a good actor and makes it work anyway.Tessa Thompson is fantastic and delivers a performance worthy of a better movie, overcomes every flawed piece of script she is handed to make the character interesting and appealing. She is the star despite the writing under-serving her role.Liam Neeson struggles with the weak writing, stiff and wooden to the point of lax direction. Seems like a bad casting choice with a mismatch of skills for the actual role.Rafe Spall is a better actor than he is allowed to be.L & L Bourgeois - Twin Bad guys are more than suitably HENCH and earned a shot at a bigger role in another movie.Director - his love of ""casablanca"" completely taints the movie, some people will like it while others will not.Writing - borders on amateur hour and ""completely paint by numbers"", leapfrogging through important establishing elements early and blowing details critical to the franchise and mood.
Full of clichés with middle east tropes in negative and useless ways, feels like a recycled B-movie spy drama from the 1940s easily set in Malta or Cypress.
They spend half the movie building the premise before getting to the meat of the story. And even then struggle to keep the story moving and are forced to use plot gimmicks. Thankfully the franchise depends on several of those gimmicks as part of it's style and appeal.SFX & Design is a huge distraction at times, over compensating for lapses in writing.Heavy focus on Action and lacks the same reliance on wit the franchise is known for. Obviously the younger cast allows for it and the Tessa and her side kick Chris have the experience to keep it interesting.",Men in Black - International

This is a mindless action comedy blockbuster. That's it.
Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson were great. We have special appearences by Liam Neeson and the amazing Emma Thompson. Lots of action, humour and fun. It was better than MIB3, that's for sure.

This installment lacked the character development, heart, humor and charm of the first (3) Men In Black films and instead tried to overcompensate with action, action and more action.There was very little chemistry between Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth and their interplay felt very flat. There was a missed opportunity to build on how Agent M (Tessa Thompson) had never been in love due to her pursuit of exhaustive search for The Men in Black and although it was touched upon a few times, nothing ever came to fruition. There was a big hint that: 1) there would be a sequel and 2) the love interest might be explored more in that possible sequel. Personally, I could care less by a movie which should've ended :30 minutes sooner than it did.For me the magic that was so prevalent in the first two films was waning heavily after the third MIB movie and this one more-or-less killed it. Ironically, many of those who commented 'LOVED IT!!!' or 'BEST MOVIE EVER!!' on another site, first started out their commentary by prefacing ""I'm a 9 (or 10) year old..."".

It has funny, clever dialogue and both characters steal the focus of the story. H has charismatic moments while M is on a path of discovery.

The aliens were diverse, colourful and as playful as they were in the 1st movie. Pawnie was played to perfection by Kunal & had good chemistry with the leads.Tesa Thompson is a Gem and I was totally sold on her as a lead, her interactions with all the characters were great. Don't think any other actress could have pulled it off better.They did not go full nostalgia and only had a few cameos. I was really impressed they decided to stay in the MiB universe & stay away from bringing back Will or Tommy Lee.The Bad!
The plot twist could be seen from a mile away though Liam Neeson had a strong showing in the 1st half of the movie.Though it was a PG-13 movie, the stakes in this movie felt so low despite all the fun moments.

The second one was a major letdown, making the same movie, just reversing the roles. The third was a great return to form, but it wasn't anything amazing like the first. This is on the same level as the third. The humor was in point, but the story was lacking. The biggest sin this movie makes is ditching the prosthetics and going with all CGI.

It wasn't meant to be taken quite seriously, I think. First of all, I love the tech! Love the guns and secret weapons and stuff, also the idea of having a secret agency just underneath our skin. However, when you actually think about it, nothing really make sense. Especially when they were fighting in the streets. I know they have badass tech but everything just happened so suddenly, I don't believe that no one, not a single soul notice anything or seen anything. And even if they wipe their memories afterward, there is bound to have someone like Molly who didn't get wiped. I was quite disappointed to see such potential in the world building in this franchise but wasn't used to its full extent (and properly) in this one. Many scenes took me out of the action because of the lack of consistency.Also, I was so thrilled to see Frank the bulldog but frustrated that he had barely any screen time (it was like less than a minute?) I understand that he is a constant character in the franchise and maybe it was an Easter egg or something. But when Frank is on all the posters and was promoted largely multiple time with press tours and stuff. It didn't quite live up to the hype, honestly. He didn't even interact with out two protagonist.Overall, this movie is just for the laughs and the nostalgia. Everything happens too quickly and often times, things were barely an inconvenience for the characters and moving the plot along. I can't even remember what the shape shifting guys want. Story telling, meh. But can't deny that I had fun watching it and awing over Chris Hemsworth and the crazy tech.",Men in Black - International

Like a sexy comic relief and the hero. However the comic relief was not comedic and a perfect hero is not interesting at all. I found the main characters unfunny and uninteresting.

Pros: we actually see MIB away from New York. I enjoyed a different scenery. Showing more different types of aliens was a plus. The plot was good and ended fairly well. It showed that some things can be flawed but fixed in certain ways. Chris Hemsworth delivered decent comedy while also being serious at times. Thompson was a good leading role to fill.. Steve/Pawnee was great and should be in future films.Cons: Chris Hemsworth still has the Thor mentality. Could have gone without that, but wasn't awful. Tessa join MIB way too fast I like Will Smith.

The banter seems forced/contrived/'insert joke here', unlike that between Will Smith/Tommy Lee JonesProbably to appeal to kiddies I thought there were far too many cuts to the obligatory odd/weird/cute aliens that have no other role than to be odd/weird/cute.

I am sure that if i had a baby, he could not stay below television more than 15 minute ... what was that little thing which make whole of movie as cartoon? I remember that when I saw the scense of MIB 1997 in mosts of parts i feel afraid but now , just say : are you kidding me? really? this much bad??I suppose all 110,000,000 USD is for the payment of Liam Neeson and Chris Hemsworth. whole movie was made in a homeLiam Neeson !!!!! i do not expect from you to involve on this horrible movie.I suggest to all children around the world if they want to think how much they grow up, just sit and see this movie ... after it you say with yourself what adult people think?",Men in Black - International

744,juliemt,Some will like it - But I was very disappointed,2,26 August 2019,"I always LOVED the MIB movies growing up, they still entertain me! From the style of the aliens, the weapons, the story, the humor... So in my eyes there is nothing truly like this franchise. But I felt like this movie kept nothing of that, the story felt so off from the originals (perhaps a bit of my opinion).
And to be honest, this is your typical: lets just make some money!
The story is flat, and you know how it all will end. There is no true excitement, the writing works for children: Children who never saw the original movies.The new designs of the aliens are waaay off. They are so heavily based of modern designs.It is a VERY lazy movie... Couldn't wait to get out of the cinema.",Men in Black - International

Terrible couple. They do not stop talking throughout the movie and it gave me unbearable headache. Also their tones are the same all the time.

You can see the cliches and twists from miles away, the story is shallow as a puddle, most characters are just there for comic relief but there is no tension to get a relief from, so it basically feels like watching burlesque, where people are chasing each other around a table, throwing pies and stuff. It was rather disappointing when you compare it to the Marvel movies of the last few years or anything from Disney, really.

(Let's not even get into obvious plot holes) While the first MIB had great physical comedy from Will Smith and the perfect straight man in Tommy Lee Jones, this just had... actors looking for a paycheque.There's a scene where the usually impeccable Tessa Thompson reacts to alien shenanigans in a close up and it looks like it was taken right out of a bad sketch show.Children will probably be entertained, but I wouldn't recommend it to adults.",Men in Black - International

For the real Man in Black fans it is a disappointment. It shows more similarity to todays Marvell movies. Full of action, animation and mumbo jumbo shooting, but horrible story. Also the references to the original movies was just poorly made, unnecessary and sad. The animation and the looks itself is good, but we know that it is not what matters.Also the execution of a world wide Man in Black organization have failed in my opinion. Or it just feels cheaply made to me.I don't mind the female main actress. I think it is good to the movie. Also it is very fitting to todays society. But questioning the name of the organisation from a fenimist point of view was unnecessary and pointless to me.All in all the movie was a big disappointment to me. I did't watch any trailer before, because i knew that i wanted to watch this in the cinema. But after 3 legendary movies it was a big letdown. Also it don't deserve the greatness of MIB. movie themes. It was just another new space action movie in a Man in Black suit, just like the old Edgar was a suit to his poor wife after the bug put him on.",Men in Black - International

The plot is stereotypical, the acting is awful/subpar (except for Emma, and Patton who can apparently not screw up a role) and the storyline is as predictable as it is allowed to be, thus the two stars.

Tessa Thompson was the only watchable actor, the others were just there as a further insult to the mib franchise. Hemsworth is painful to watch, he's just good for Thor.

It is obviously not the same as the awesome MIB-I, but then it shouldn't be expected to be. It was a lot of fun to watch. I had many good laughs. Everyone was smiling. Chris Hemsworth was literally the ""dumb but pretty blonde"" (sorry, I don't mean to use a sexist slur); but that was the idea. And there were some cool gadgets and Kumail Nanjiani's extraordinary voice-over with a fun to watch Tessa Thompson. What is the problem? The audience and critics taking themselves too seriously.

tessa thosmpsom and chris Hemsworth working together is best part of the film, they are awesome together.
i was excited to see the vision of F. Gary Gray in MIB, but it was just like other MIB.
it was very hard to believe that this movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, i mean his movies was filled with energy but movie.....
This movie is not that funny, it felt so flat, while watching the film i was sitting silent most of the time which is very unlike the other MIB films.
Chris Hemsworth is great in comedy as we seen in Endgame and Thor: Ragnarok i think he script for his character was not that good.

It's original (The characters & t he plot path, not the setting)
The characters feel alive! A lot of depth. Moving the plot forward is linked to our better understanding of the characters including the secondary ones (Not perfect, but good for a summer flic).World felt alive & real. Even the bad guys. Great CGI. Good aliens.Great movie over all! Made me feel a little like when I watched the first one as a kid!

796,StrengthAndHonor69,Get Ready to Rumble !,2,14 September 2019,"An absolute must rabbit hole of reviews !
This movie is not what you are hoping for and definitely not what your expecting. If you like the current trend of media conditioning and programing plus pushing the bizarre PC culture on you... you might like the movie. Chris Hemmsworth is cast to be a vapid eye candy for gay men and secret obsession of women scared to be women in public. He's a great actor but they are clipping his wings in this, he hasn't caught on that blonde hair and. Well his demographic is being assassinated in themedia... then there is neeson and they clipped him too.. another movie based on making men look like fools and the actress is the all knowing, tough , lumberjack, that carries the whole movie.. umm but actually, whoever thought she was capable of a lead role was sadly mistaken unless they are trying to influence erasing this franchise from existence. Though that seems the only out come here. Even the Damage Control Trolls and their onslaught of posts were far to easy to spot each clump oozing through, each one thinking their post would save the movie . Problem is they give themselves away far to easy and are like horrible used car sales ""persons""(See, I did it, PC). it's actually funny how similar they are these days.. Probably because it's a break from their cnnnn daytime job melting their cognitive abilities by trying to defend things that are obviously even to them a sacrifice of one's basic common sense and complete evisceration of their morals.. can't look in the mirror anymore.. sad how many have been filling the clinics up with mental break downs..
Eh anyway.. this movie has gone the way of SaturdayNightLive,JimmyKimmel,Colbert,all the sold out writers blackmailed actors etc.. pushing the mental growth of America's children into a blender to strip of any real skills, dreams, sense of self, culture, heritage, religion, knowing that blowingADozenDudesIsNOTaGoodThimg!Be aMan if you are born a Man, Be A Woman uf yourBornA Woman.. any other just quit shoving it in everyone face and give back the RainBow! It's NOT YOURS! Come up with your own symbol, your creative.
The FX are great and there are some great surprises! Plus a very memorable critter... you will laugh , you will cry? You will hear more of the same audio jammed in your ears over and over that is the same as on the radio and tv and everywhere that you can't escape it.. jeeze I listen to Rock and Metal, musicianship is Paramount yet you will never hear true Rock or Metal on tv or movies just crap they claim to be.. Yet this other stuff I dontvlisten to at all and I know the artists the lyrics the repetitive beat and yeah, uh huh yeah.. In the club with the bub, smack in my female dawg up got my nine just in time to make dis rhyme yeah uh huh huh yeah 
The ALiENS are great they completely take the world by storm. They are so spineless they abandon their world's that could be ANYTHING they want them to be and then attack earth not real8sing they are just pawns and they are helping destroy the freedom they say they want. The big plot twist could be to just fill out the paper work and follow the path and focus on Education.

And the scene where they showed a picture of agent K and J killing the giant cockroach. That was paying respect to the original men in black, and I loved that.

I have to say the new men in back isn't as good as old series, but it's not bad. It has the usual comic style of the Men in Back and various novel technologies and lovely aliens.But it lacks excitement and logic, too much comedy rely on Chris Hemsworth' s figure and appearance.

821,drbonkers,Unnecessary and Unfunny,3,27 June 2019,"Think of the original MIB trilogy, your mind probably goes to the sci-fi action, humor, and chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. Now imagine those movies with two main characters with little to no chemistry between them, humor that falls flat, and bad and unnecessary action sequences, now your imagining MIB International. I fully expected Chris Hemsworth (who I liked in his previous roles in the MCU) to be a driving force of comedy, or at the very least bring his undeniable charm to this role. Instead, they made his character unbearably arrogant and selfish. It would be like if Tommy Lee Jones' character in the original MIB spent the entire movie bragging and being obnoxious, but he didn't, he had a sense of humor and seriousness at the same time, making his character both simple and complex. And the humor in this movie is atrocious, the original movies are well known for their blend of sci-fi with comedy, almost every joke in this movie falls flat. I kept track of my every laugh during my viewing of the movie, I laughed a total of 0 times, I don't even think I smiled once. The chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is enough to keep a smile on my face, the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thomson is almost nonexistent, it's like watching oil and water, waiting for them to mix, but they never do. It's the ""classic"" woman living in an arrogant man's world situation. There are good examples of this though; like Zootopia or Anchorman. The cgi is sometimes horrible, I would consider the original MIB movies to have better cgi, AND THERE ALMOST 20 YEARS OLD! And there's this small alien that follows the two agents around during almost the entire movie and it might be one of the worst characters I've ever seen in a film, reaching Jar-Jar levels of unfunny. Overall, this film is completely unnecessary. I get it, all movie studios want is money and the MIB movies made a lot of money, but putting out crap like this and selling it on name recognition alone is just criminal. This movie is bland and devoid of humor, good action, chemistry, and point of existence. I hope to God the bad reviews (including my own) squish and chance of sequels.",Men in Black - International
822,stylesbke,Superheroes in wrong universe,6,15 June 2019,"First of all i was very excited to see the MIB finally back in action. Loved every past movie of the series but this one never fulfilled me. Is it because I identify the MIB with great characters played by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones? This could be.The replacements Chris Hemsworth, Liam Neeson & Tessa Thomspon were okay but in my opinion didn't convince. Just because Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thomspon (never a fan of her) were great in the Avengers, do i have to see them now in every blockbuster? They could have done a much better cast, start a fresh series with new faces.The Story is predictable from the start to finish and the action scenes were just disappointing (and no i will not start about the logic). Since the series was so long away from the screen, they could have a much better part of introducing the viewer to this world, the characters, what it takes to be a MIB.Old jokes taken from the past movies did not make it better. And why did the worm guys did not play a more important tole (i was hoping for that). The villains were just useless, never at any stage of the movie i had the feeling that they can be taken serious.Even though this critic is very negative, i think it is a movie which you can casually watch without any expectations and can be enjoyed. However don't expect to be amazed.",Men in Black - International
823,krstip,Mediocre,4,16 June 2019,"The chemistry been the main characters was there, and they did a good job, but nothing could save the weak plot. It takes so much building up to get anywhere and then just skims over important information. The climax was also incredibly disappointing. It felt like I blinked and it was resolved.

Save your money and time and just watch the earlier men and black movies.",Men in Black - International
824,rjvaasen,Bland and uninteresting,6,16 April 2020,"For starters, we need to get this out of the way: the movie is by no means bad. The acting of Hemsworth, Neeson and Thompson is solid, but the original MiB feeling is just missing. The storyline is somewhat interesting, just as the special effects and such. Both do sadly not stand out in any way, which leads to a very bland movie. My recommondation: watch the other MiB movies and if you are really into it you can watch this one as well",Men in Black - International

The whole premise behind MIB is that they work covertly out of the public eye, they appeared to forget this the entire movie. There's a new agent who somehow appears to magically know everything. Plot is simple yet they resort to a flashback and beating you over the head as if they had written such a clever script. Hemsworth is an enjoyable actor in most films but he plays this character over the top silly.Tessa Thompson is miscast and frankly awful. It would have helped if she didn't wear high heals throughout",Men in Black - International

842,rerememe2002,Underwhelming and Political,6,9 February 2020,"Despite my review title, this film wasn't all bad. I enjoyed the overall story, the special effects, the film artistry, and some of the humor (what there was of it). And Chris Helmsworth is always lovely to look at. But...It was subversively (or perhaps overtly) political. Take a expectantly multi-racial, female actress in the person of Tessa Thompson (whose acting is forgettable, by the way, being devoid of emotion and anything uniquely memorable in her characteristics both physical and personality-wise) and place her in the forefront of the film to portray a feminist agenda that is difficult to miss. There's certainly nothing wrong with a female lead character and, being a woman myself, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy a strong woman lead. But I don't want it if it means there is a political purpose behind it on a movie where politics don't belong. This character's persona was forcefully strong and overbearing at the detriment of the lead male character. Played by Chris Hemsworth, who is highly regarded as a strong, masculine person, this character was made to appear the idiot next to the female lead. He was consistently put down and emasculated in every way possible and at every opportunity. If it were simply for comic effect, this could all be forgiven. But it was obvious that comedy was not a central theme to this film.Unlike its predecessors (MIB I, II, and III), there was very little of a comic element in the film. In fact, if it weren't for a tiny little character who didn't have many lines until about half way through the film, there wouldn't have been any at all. Even the DVD's special features admits that they sacrificed humor in the alien character designs for admittedly scarier options instead.Family-conscious viewers will be disappointed to know that there were fewer than five bad words, each one avoidable and entirely unnecessary. Combined with the ""scarier"" aliens and underlying political theme, this eliminates any family friendly aspect this film might have had.Finally, the script was predictable down to the antagonist/villain, whom I had pegged from the first moment the character stepped onto the screen. I get the idea that Hollywood doesn't have respect enough for its viewers to avoid predictability or any faith in us to understand a story that isn't straight out of a can.On a side note, I'd love to see more of Les Twins in anything!Overall, this was a disappointment. I will not be adding it to my personal library and I'm glad I didn't fork out the money to see it in the theater. But for just under two hours, I was ""mildly"" entertained.",Men in Black - International

Jokes apart, the movie have a lot of action and CGI and little good dialogues, unlike the first movies. The first trilogy inspired me of thinking about the cosmos and dream about alien existence but this one was little about the cosmos and a lot about laser guns and bang bang. It has no humor whatsoever. The ""jokes"" they throw at you are terrible. Until half of the movie I was feeling that Tessa Thompson wasn't fitting in the character - note that they did a very good job on her haircut and makeup - but then I realize that was Chris Hemsworth that wasn't fitting in the MIB agent role and was just being Thor on suits. They made a terrible forced couple. The more I got into the movie the more I miss the brilliant acting and humor of Tommy Lee Jones. Even Will Smith acted pretty nice on them.

Just all-round sad. A sad little cloud of existential dread appears around this movie when I picture it in my head. Watching a normal bad movie is much less psychologically taxing than, say, staring at a wall in silence for two hours.An unfunny attempt at a joke is somewhat funny or interesting, at least a little bit. But imagine if you trained an AI to write jokes without understanding how funny works. It will write what feels like a setup and a punchline and whatnot. It will be english sentences in a joke's format, but listening to them won't be funny or interesting in the slightest. It will just make you sad. Like a part of your time on this earth has been stolen from you, with your knowledge and consent, and you also paid to have it stolen.Anyway, it's just really sad that something like this came out in 2019. I would go as far as to say it's the worst thing to come out of that year. Maybe a very dumb kid will find happiness in the shiny laser guns.

869,davidbenrivera,I thought it was really good,9,2 July 2019,"I think this is the best MIB movie ever made. I personally didn't like the originals cause they were gross and the aliens were always too weird. This one didn't have that gross feeling for the most part so I was satisfied. It doesn't mention nor refer to the previous movies except through a picture so idk if that might be a problem for anyone wanting a special connection to the originals. The chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson was what kept the movie going and it is what made the movie enjoyable. There were some boring parts but for the most part it was good. Ponzie was hilarious and his whole ""protect the queen"" element was spot on. I recommend it.",Men in Black - International
870,phil-40099,Lackluster writing and direction leaves a sour taste for a potentially great movie,2,9 September 2019,"I spent most of the first half of the film wondering why writers treat their audiences like ultra-dumb people. Most of the dialogue was to explain what was going on in the movie, leaving next-to-no-space for riveting dialogue dedicated to pacing or for character or plot development.When you have to explain through dialogue the who, why, where, when and how of every alien or concept then you know the writing is poor. The clincher for me to see how poor the writing was occurred when one of the lines delivered explained how an alien had acquired an item and then ""bought"" (sic) it to Earth. Maybe they are getting kids still learning English with little life experience to do the writing these days?Hemsworth was the 'funny man' in the movie and delivered characteristically Hemsworth written one-liners reminiscent of his role as Thor in the MCU. As a funny-man, Hemsworth is a better straight-talking actor, and he should probably stay away from delivering more than 2 one-liners in a film, and definitely shouldn't deliver more than one 'one-liner' every 45 mins or so.A nod to his Thor character was well delivered and shows you don't need to lead the audience by the hand with dialogue explaining every little thing. Let the acting do the talking, the audience will understand what is happening with that if it is directed and acted well.The only true piece of good script writing occurred later in the film when the two main protagonists were working together on a way to get themselves back to where they needed to be. This revealed the tension between the two, their motives, and desires and showed their vulnerabilities. While short in nature, this is what the film lacked throughout. After that point the film was bearably better, albeit only slightly more so.Tessa Thompson's character was arguably the best in this new film and she was more like Will Smith's character in the first few films of the MIB franchise, than Hemsworth's character was, and her character could have been developed and fleshed out more. Giving more screen time and dialogue to her than Hemsworth would have paid dividends, and made for a better story arc and film, without sacrificing any SciFi/CGI elements.Liam Neeson's character would have been better played by a new-comer or maybe another mid-level actor. Neeson himself didn't bring much to the table in terms of acting for his role, however that may have been as a result of giving him too little (good) dialogue, direction, screen-time and character development.As a fan of hip-hop culture I was surprised to see the dancing duo of Les Twins play the role of the villain(s). They were given a (pathetic) chance to show their hip-hop skills which was only shown because of their hip-hop background. It really didn't need to be in there and didn't do them justice as dancers either.Overall I think this could have been a 9 or 10 film if better writers were employed to give dialogue for character development and story arc, especially if it was given to Tessa Thompson's character - rather than on explaining unnecessary stuff through dialogue (e.g. ""this is a gun that does x,y, and z"" doesn't add anything to the movie (plot or character)).I love the MIB films, and this one didn't do justice to the franchise or what the franchise delivered in the first film - that is a pair of flawed characters seeking redemption or meaning to their lives, searching for something , overcoming personal odds, struggles and adversity to be something more. I blame the writers for much of the flawed nature of this film.",Men in Black - International

886,lior-08111,Disappointing movie,6,14 June 2019,"I watched MIB international yesterday maybe not with high hopes (I do like the series but I believe it's not one of the top in the cinema) but I still had some hopes for the movie as I enjoyed the previous 3. Needless to say I was disappointed will smith was not featured as well as Tommy Lee Jones, but Chris Hemsworth was featured so I was rolling with it.
The movie began quite like many super heroes movies (showing the kid agent M and a wierd animal which may hint about the future),
Molly finds the MIB base and after convincing them why they shouldn't delete her memory she joins MIB on trial.
I have to say that until this point I was quite ok with the current plot, the rest of the movie was quite a disaster.
Molly gets connected to agent H and they fight a couple of aliens (typical mib movie which is fine), but there is no real strong connection developed between Molly and H.
The story with the aliens is lacking plot, no one tells us if they are actually bad or good and at the end we find out they might actually be good.
in addition to that, high T is apparently also controlled by these aliens - but it just happens, no one tells us how it happened and what is the aliens' milestone in this story.
Overall I was pretty disappointed but not because the parts were not good , the problem was that the plot was dull and empty, I didn't have many bad things to write about because there were not many things to write about in general!
The effects of the movie were quite good on the positive side.
The main problem is that even for kids (13 year olds for example) , this movie would not be entertaining as the action was simply boring and there was no comedy.
While I know mib doesn't label under the comedy genre, it does have some nice jokes usually which didn't appear here.
I would give this movie maybe a bit less like 5 or 5.5 but I have respect for the overall series which is in much higher quality than this one (for the last 3 I would rate it at 8 on average).
As I said before, the movie is quite hard to describe as there is nothing almost to describe and it was not special, lacks plot and maybe Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson were not the perfect players to fill in Tommy Lee Jones and will Smith's shoes.",Men in Black - International

You start watching the movie with great expectations, and that's where it ends... You while out every excruciating minute waiting for something genuinely exciting to happen.. and it never does.
Thor and valkyrie outside the MCU are meh.. And there's no denying that sad truth.
Probably the best character in the movie was the CGI 'pawny'.

896,theaveragevegetable,Such a waste,6,19 October 2019,"I feel like I've seen this story before.........The title may be a bit of an exaggeration but it really is. The original MIB movies are some great things, not perfect (especially the 2nd), but not terrible either. This movie in directly copies the same story of the first, but less relatable and charming. The ""plot twists"" that are thrown in to try and deceive us that this is a different story are easy to figure out and very boring and safe. I want something to surprise me in science fiction with different sets and cool places that make us think about the greater universe and what would be possible if this actually existed, not have the same by the books ""evil super entity"". Some amazing concepts could be thought of with this universe and we only got to see a tiny bit of the creativity that these designers have to offer and share.The humor is very standard for these types of action movies as well as the soundtrack. The performances were easily the best part of this movie with all of the actors doing a good job and playing the part well. I think there were a few unnecessary characters but nothing too unbearable.I don't know whether to recommend this or not. If your looking to switch off for an hour and a half then maybe put this on but overall I would say this is a disappointing movie. I saw someone else say that this felt like scenes were missing and it does, unresolved plot lines, obscure scenes with seemingly no point, it's just messy.",Men in Black - International

Luckily, I can assure you that it rather surprised me positively and I had a relaxing and fun evening.That being said, keep in mind that it is still an MIB movie. You shouldn't watch this movie if you absolutely hate sf/fantasy or if you love a heavy plot.Is this a masterpiece or even the best MIB? No.

899,ronnel-29112,Atrocious,2,12 February 2020,"This movie was an abomination and tarnished the legacy of the MiB franchise (even the 3rd one). Characters lacked humor, wit, swagger and even an ounce of chemistry. Hemsworth has comedic timing as proven by his Marvel role so this was just down to poor writing and script pacing. Tessa's character was farfetched and did not make sense at all. Neeson's character however was by far the worst.It was arguably his worst role in the last decade. All the alien characters lacked the liability and depth of previous ones with Nanjiani's being the one redeemable introduction but not enough to excuse the others. Even the believability of the current alien technology was laughable for a 20 year gap. Hopefully they will let this franchise rest.",Men in Black - International

However the excessive amount of virtue signaling and wokeness was just too much.

Which unfortunately makes her very arrogant and unlikeable. The MIB films were always about telling epic stories spanning the universe.

It's poor.The critics got it spot on with this shambles and I'm sure that a large portion of the ten out of tens are as genuine as a nine pound note.This film has actually put me off a little the main two leads now.

930,aymen_randy,Worst MIB movie ever,1,26 September 2019,"I can sum it up in one simple reason.
MIB used to be good because of lead actors , Actors who were in a proper place .
This MIB contains an unwanted, None essential female Actor , under the name of equality .
enough of this BS already .
Let's care abt equality and forget abt the movie , that's what I've got from this MIB .

934,ahmet-735-601772,Intro of a tv series,5,28 June 2019,"Original men in black was a great success, we watched and we still watching time to time when there is nothing else to watch. Do not consider this one as a movie, it looks more like a single episode tv series, that's the quality of the movie and some tv series has much better production than this movie. I am really wondering where did they spent 110M$, probably 109 for casting and 1 for shooting movie.Besides shooting this movie and wasting everyone's time and money they could shoot a tv series, it would cost the same and probably would make more less same earning, exclude branding and franchise toys etc.It was a long shot, but we can call it a success, there are many fans of MIB, producers know this and even they shoot the worst movie they knew there are people will watch it.Next movie must be ultra fantastic otherwise no one will watch it, or they might consider tv series.

936,Weirdyoda04,This movie is missing a key MiB element and it's not Will Smith,3,17 September 2019,"I didn't see this mentioned in any other reviews but this movie lacks a proper villian.MiB 1: Giant roach wearing a mans skin looking for the galaxy.
MiB 2: Tentacle lady takes MiB headquarters hostiage.
MiB 3: A super dangerous convict that escaped from MiB prison.
MiB 4: Twins? A mustashe? An arms dealer? ""The Hive""? An agent that doesn't like another agent? Nope, Nope, Nope, Kinda, and nope. It takes 90 minutes to reveal the true antagonist of the film.The other movies had a clear antagonist and plot twist or two thrown in but this is the only one where the plot twist IS the bad guy. They do similarly bad storytelling in Iron Man 3 when they set up an interesting bad guy that is suspiciously underdeveloped only for the writers to say, ""GOTCHA! THAT'S NOT A VILLIAN AT ALL! HERE'S THE REAL VILLAIN!""In my opinion they messed up a key ingredient to the story and while it works for some movies it totally ruins this one. There are some other problems with the movie like the protagonist being a Mary Sue and all that but I think those problems would be easier to overlook if there were a more clear enemy to overcome.",Men in Black - International

F. Gary Gray is way to talented to mess up this movie. As I expected, he knocked it out of the park. How could they go wrong with Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson? Both are fine entertainers and great at their craft. And the brothers Laurent and Larry? Where have they been hiding? The visuals and set designs were incredible. The CGI was used at its best. And the Aliens? I am running out of words of praise. I was expecting jar jar binks based on the low ratings.

952,Radiio,Feels like a cash-grab,5,10 July 2019,"I'll be honest, the introduction of the antagonists towards the beginning of the film was dark and gritty, which could have ended up as an amazing shift in tone for the MIB series. I really wanted to know more about the twins as well as their backstory, but it got ended far too quickly.
Also, I understand that the MIB series has elements of comedy in it, but with International, it seemed much too forced. Pawny added absolutely nothing to the story in this movie and I hated his character. It felt like he was in the movie so often only to get a couple of cheap laughs off people.
Overall, the acting from Thompson, Hemsworth and Neeson were good and I somewhat enjoyed their characters. The comedy elements just felt forced and the story was kinda rushed.Also, the amount of 'subtle' advertising was insane, as in, it became ridiculous.

The main characters plot development in total was being belligerent while insisting she's special and when she finally got into the MiB having ""almost"" perfect test scores, I was surprised they just didn't just give her 100s after the build up. There was a quick discussion between the lead and the head of MiB that the name of the organization needed to be changed to be more inclusive. Which would be Like going to the head of the FBI and asking why it wasn't called something else.The men in the film just run around acting like petulant children with boring I'm better than you arguments or acting like frat boys.Halfway through the movie the alien that was introduced at the beginning shows up and removes all tension siding with our main character which takes away any redeeming character development between the two agents.When the turning point near the end of the film happens we are given a canned bait and switch regarding the main ""villain"".What doesn't make any sense if we are to take the past 3 movies into account, is how the mind wiping technology works. They tell everyone the truth then wipe their minds, but our British agent it caused a feedback loop which effected his personality? If they make such a joke about the tech why make a point to say a neurolizer is a privilege.The jokes fall flat the action is tepid and the only redeeming character is Pawnee.",Men in Black - International

I love Men in Black, I love the Marvel movies and Chris Hemsworth as Thor, I loved Tessa Thompson in Thor: Ragnorak. I was so very excited for this movie and ended up leaving during the third act. From the very beginning this movies pacing is awful. Who thought casting two dancers as the ""villains"" was a good idea? They were boring and had about 2-3 lines throughout the whole film. They didn't put much emphasis on the international aspect of the movie. They were kind of just like ""Hey we're in Paris, okay now we're in Morraco, now we're in the dessert, back to Paris. Hemsworth tried his hardest to carry this film but every joke he tries to bounce off of Tessa's ""Agent M"" falls horribly flat. They made him a stuge despite supposedly being the best agent in his division. I got real bad Ghostbusters (2016) vibes from this. Also women have been in the ""Men in Black"" series since the beginning so the repetitive ""Women/People/Humans in Black"" jokes get real stale real quick and I believe will not age well with the movie. I really could go on and on about what upset me with this movie as I'm a huge fan of the first 3 films (the original being the best obviously).

I will however give this movie credit where it's due, and is the only reason it got any stars from me at all, which is the fantastic work by the rest of the crew and extra's. In one scene in particular, the 'we care' office scene, I was blown away by the performances of the surrounding office staff. One extra in particular, speaking into a headset at the back of the frame, really sold me on the feel and experience of an office, and was truly the most immersive part of the film.tldr; swap the actors with the extras and you'll have a 10/10 movie",Men in Black - International
989,roboot-46802,MIB fans will love it,10,16 June 2019,"I find both the critics and general public's reception to this film to be quite misleading, and I was disappointed to see the scores the movie is receiving having waited to check on them until after I viewed the movie for myself. And I am glad I did. I will more than likely continue this method of determining whether a movie is ""worth my time and money"". Bottom line is the people panning this movie could not be more wrong. By all means, everyone is entitled to their own opinions... but what did any of you expect when you went to go see this film? It's a MEN IN BLACK movie that takes place in the MEN IN BLACK universe. The film should be appropriately evaluated as such. All of this film critiquing suggesting a lack of character development and stating how uninteresting the characters were while speaking out of both sides of your mouths and still being complimentary of the chemistry and performances of Tessa and Chris together is both laughable and incomprehensible. The irony here is that the entire premise behind the very first MIB film in the franchise was about the recruitment process of Will Smith's Agent J and how certain people are perfect fits for their roles in the MIB universe BECAUSE of how uninteresting and insignificant they are as regular, everyday people.... which is what makes them perfect for the MIB. The audience should not be expecting to learn much about Tessa's character Molly other than the fact that she dedicated much of her life to trying to discover who the MIB were and that determination and will is what makes her a perfect fit for them. All of that being said, this film serves as an origin story for a new set of characters playing agents in the company, while still maintaining the continuity of the MIB agency that had previously been established in the first three films. This film is a gateway to a broader, more expanded MIB universe. I, for one, was thrilled to get to experience it. As much as I loved seeing Agents J and K's adventures through the different timelines of the first three films, it was time for a change of pace. Those characters story arcs were played out. It was enjoyable to see the transition of Tessa's character as an every day person seeking out the answers of the universe, into a woman of the MIB agency solving crimes to save the galaxy. This movie very much served as a journey for both Tessa and Chris's Agents M and H characters as they each went through their own personal growth and development to become a pair of elite agents within the company. The plot is fairly predictable if you are paying attention throughout the movie and take note of the obvious foreshadowing that takes place. But let's be real here, it isn't the twists and turns and dense scripts with character development and villains plotting playing out on screen that draws fans to this franchise in the first place. We go to watch these movies because we enjoy the adventures the agents go on and all of the hilarious alien disguises and the ridiculous weaponized alien technology that is so fascinating to watch. And therein lies the entertainment value in this film. The modern day special effects and CGI makes for great cinematography within this Men in Black film franchise.

I loved every other MIB movies and yeah some are not 10/10 but at least they weren't a 4.I thought some moments were a bit pointless and made zero sense. Agent M and H were ok I thought H was just weird, was like something was wrong with him which is what I thought was the point until I found out no it was just a weird script.Was let down by agent M as she was meant to be this super smart character but ended up being just plain jane.Jokes were meh.It was just odd. It didn't look under budget but it did feel like one if that makes sense. Disappointed as it feels like a dying franchise. For me if the franchise were to continue it needs that feel back.

Maybe a team up with MIBs new international duo, have all 4 save the universe. The plot actually felt like an MIB plot and the actors were solid and seem to have great chemistry together.

Couldn't be any more stereotypical with the main characters being a typical party animal with bad judgement and an over the top super intelligent woman who continuously criticises her partner. The character of M also doesn't work for the franchise since it makes the MiB organisation look way less secretive than it should be for reasons that fans should know.

The dialogue was bad.
The effects were bad.

1011,battlar,Cannot think of any merit,4,21 June 2019,"Before seeing this movie, actual I did not have high expectation to it. Still, I found this film very disappointing and not worth the price.The story line is boring and is not creative at all. Nearly all the plots are predictable and seem familiar to other movies that I see. The behavior of the characters are not explained well enough. You just cannot understand why the main actor would act so thoughtless and careless as a professional agent. Most importantly, the story is quite shallow. Maybe MIB is just a comedy and do not intend to give inspiration to its audiences. But having a few thought-provoking scenes will definitely make this film more attractive.Another problem is that the dialogues between characters is unnatural and even awkward sometimes.In short, it is not a bad movie. But I just cannot think of any merit of it.",Men in Black - International

I found the movie just straight up boring and unfunny. Way too many times the movie was trying too hard to be funny.The story it self was really dull, I remember seeing the ending and having not a single clue what was going on. So boring! There's like nothing new here! No new insight in the MIB world or new creatures.This is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen! Really a shame.

So if you dont take things too seriously there is loads to enjoy. Yes, there is some female brattiness but this flaw is mirrored by her partners male cockiness. This banter tention of brattiness with cockiness did not seem to me to be feminist undertones as some reviewes have complained nor his character made to be bungling, but its more showing him struggling from something and her flaw of brattiness and cold logic. We've all been there, not quite ourself but still doing our work. Several male characters commented he wasnt himself lately. The movie explains it briefly why he is a little garbled in his stellar skills but you have to pay close attention to catch it near the climax. But he is still always strong despite this and could throw down in a fight always and knew the ropes on where to go to investigate. The female she had her strengths too with logic and smarts but not so much with gutt instict like her experienced partner so their strengths, they needed each other to not get crushed in the crisis.It was funny to see their human foibles and messups and how they used their strengths to recover and fight again in a big alien smack down, shoot out, flying blasting unrealistic science fantasy yet so much fun to watch scenes.

I wish I could say he saved the movie but sadly that's not the case, he is however the reason I was willing to give it at least five stars. As usual, with so many sequels this far in it's as if the movie studios just wing it and don't really put effort into production, figuring they'll just continue to make money off of the original's success.

I note that it has the participation of Emma Thompson, who despite appearing little and simply crumbles when it appears, and Rebbeca Ferguson, who even very makeup has an overwhelming presence. The ""Twins"" are fantastic to me (impossible not to compare them to the ""Matrix"" twins), and they are really professional dancers. They do some ""otherworldly"" steps and for me they are one of the highlights of the movie. The story is beautiful, the music is strongly inspired by previous films, the source of the lyrics of the presentation is also the same. Tessa Thompson I think grabs the paper very well, and the movie at the end ends a circle started at the beginning, something I always love to see. I think it's not only a good spin-off, but it honorably honors the previous trilogy. Remember that we are not the same as we were 22 years ago (amazing as it was so many years ago!)

It ties a few minor characters in from movies 1-3, but this is not designed to be a continuation, it is a tangent off of that.

I don't know if it's the camera's the industry are using nowadays but the delivery of Chris's and Tessas dialogue seems, well, off.Liams acting hold up.I wonder if it's a generational thing?Outside of the delivery of dialogue the story is a confusing mix of a rushed origin story of a character (M) and a nonsensical end of world paradigm.

When I heard that Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith were being replaced by Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, I was skeptical. I finally watched it, and my skepticism was warranted. Not sure if it was just the method I used (rented it on Google Movies via a Roku), but the sound wasnt good and I had trouble hearing most of the dialogue. All the characters seemed bland, and the only one I really liked/ laughed at was Pawny. The CGI wasn't as sharp as it had been in previous movies, and it was easy to see where green screen was used. This was, in my opinion, the worst of the 4 movies. I wanted to like it, but I just couldnt.",Men in Black - International

But it seeming like Hemsworth is having a hard time letting go of Thor and going into a new role in this movie it was basically says coming out with The Avengers seeing him in the and watching this hes the same person. Also it was kind of poor humor. Yes the men in black hole idea was there but not the best actors to take the places of Will Smith and the couple of partners that he had.

Im sure i will ruffle alot of feathers by saying this, but the actor is only ever known to play a role where he is ONLY; 1) the bad guy, or 2) the bad S.O.B. that thakes matters into his own hands. He has never been known to play a part that involves him as playing a character that is innocent and sincere w/o bloodshed or personal agenda.

The way she said the jokes were literally planned for her to say them with haughtiness and a bit of contempt. Just remember when she said MIB, she just had an expression on her face that just screamed ""oh does that means that women are not included in the club, are we not up to the task, are we so worse than MEN, WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS TO WIB"". What the hell is their problem for ruining a great movie with such childish thinking and acting.
This way of filming other future movies will just ruin and mock all the old hits of good movies.

The jokes fell kind of flat, the choice of the mole was too obvious, I was really hoping it was going to be someone else. It did have its funny parts and a cute little side kick but it wasn't really enough for me. I was really young when the first MIB came out so I am not partial to that movie.

This not only summed up the intended most emotional scenes in the movie but it is also almost the entire script of those scenes.

I really wanted to like this film as I've been a fan of mib for a very long time it has a great cast but they should have reconsidered accepting this dodo after reading the script it's one they will probably look back on and wonder why they put their names to it.
I'm glad I used my cinema pass to watch this, because the thought of paying £11.50 (as I watched it in 3D) would have left me feeling what a waste of money.
Do yourself a favour before watching this film think twice save your money for something else... But not the blueray on its release wait until it's on free to view that way you are not out of pocket..",Men in Black - International

1146,gatainatasa,The truth,10,14 June 2019,"I really don't understand why people dislike this film. It's actually really funny, exciting and interesting as well. I think the critic writers don't like these types of films and thats why they give bad ratings. I'm not saying that it's the film of the year but still it is very,very good.",Men in Black - International

1150,adrianprinz,"Different, but not as bad as people say",6,30 June 2019,"Lets be honest, the only real enjoyable MIB was the first one. The biggest difference between this movie and last two were the actors. I think it ticket all the boxes for a MIB movie but the story was a big letdown. Having said that, I liked the first half of the movie.",Men in Black - International

1155,crystaldstarkey,"Great movie, like the others, excellent cast",10,10 February 2020,"I have no idea why this MIB is getting hit so bad in the ratings. It is funny, action packed, and has an excellent cast.",Men in Black - International
1156,katrinapyavka,Not bad,7,21 June 2019,"A very predictable plot, but the picture is nice. The actors' play was pretty good. But that's a movie for a 1 time for me.",Men in Black - International
1157,achebanova,Mediocre,6,12 June 2019,"The problem of this movie is not a female lead how smb here said ( I can't believe you even see this as an issue you sexist freaks) or the lack of Will Smith, but:
shallow characters (except maybe Tessa Thompson character but she is also on this ice)stupid and unrealistic dialogues that do little to introduce the characters to the audiencethe main 'threat' being poorly explained to the audience do you hardly even understand why you should be worriedthe plot twists that don't actually surprise the audience but just make you go 'huh' at bestunrealistic characters' behaviour6/10 at best. I think I can say I enjoyed the action and the main two characters are hot but that's it. Could have been much better.",Men in Black - International
1158,mathewh-74213,Excellent movie,9,6 August 2019,I thought the movie was unreal. Not only did they still make it so realistic like other MIB movies but it was well executed. Having Chris Hemsworth as the main character put a lot of interest in the movie,Men in Black - International
1159,gianniplugandplay,Well Done!!!,9,4 August 2019,"Save some time for this international edition of MIB...great fun and a good plot, in my opinion a very good way to spend 2 hours!!!

1161,hfullen,The worst movie i've seen in cinema,4,14 October 2019,This cliché driven film is so clearly a heartless cash grab missing all the heart and fun of the original. But not only that the plot makes less sense than the star wars prequels.,Men in Black - International
