0,SnoopyStyle,good tension,8,30 March 2020,"It's 2003 and America is making the case to go to war with Iraq. Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley) is a British intelligence translator in GCHQ. They secretly listen in on communications around the world. Everybody gets an email ordering them to work with the Americans to dig up dirt on other UN Security Council states and push them to pass a war vote. Katharine is shocked. Despite the powerful Official Secrets Act, she risks everything to leak the damaging memo to the public. Journalist Martin Bright (Matt Smith) breaks with his paper's endorsement of the war to publish the article as the power of the state bears down upon Katharine and her refugee husband.I am surprised at the tension of this movie. It helps that I remember a little of the story but not its outcome for Katharine. One thing that frustrated me early on is the attitude of the husband. Without any insights into his character, he can come off as a callous clueless buffoon. The movie needs to lay out his situation from the beginning so that the audience can appreciate his point of view. The other minor issue is the title. It is the blandest of titles. The book's title ""The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War"" would be vastly better. This movie has lots of tension as a thriller and loads of insight into war creating.",Official Secrets
1,boblipton,Sounds Unlikely,6,8 September 2019,"Keira Knightley is a 'listener' for GCHQ, the British spy agency that listens in on phone conversations. All of the news is about the forthcoming Iraqi war, and she spends a lot of time shouting at the TV whenever Tony Blair is on. One day a memo comes through: the CIA is looking for stuff to blackmail members of the UN Security Council, so they'll vote more sanctions on Iraq, justifying an invasion by the U.S. and Britain. So she leaks the memo, in defiance of the Official Secrets Act. Eventually, the close and constant quizzing of her colleagues gets to her and she marches in and confesses she was the leaker.It's an unlikely story: so much so, I find it unbelievable except that it seems to be true. In fact, it's a very well told told, with good actors (Matthew Goode, Ralph Fiennes, Matt Smith, Rhys Ifans). What it is not is a movie, with its low-level lighting, limited focal depth, fixed camera and compositions that scream out that, yes, this is being shown in a wide-screen format on the movie screen, but it's set up so you can cut off the edges for standard TV composition without losing anything.In short, take a look at it when it shows up on TV. It's worth your time. It's just not the thing to pay to go to a movie theater for.",Official Secrets
2,Horst_In_Translation,The longer it goes the better it gets,8,6 December 2019,"""Official Secrets"" is a British/American co-production mostly in the English language and this (already) award-winning film is the most recent directorial effort by South African BAFTA nominee Gavin Hood (Tsotsi). He is also one of the writers because he and the Goldsteins adapted the book into a screenplay of 110 minutes here. The big star at the center of it all is Keira Knightley and I like her, so I am glad her career is still heading in the right direction after her Oscar nominations really happened a long time ago already. But maybe she can sneak in for a third time with this film. Time will tell. I think she played her part really well and proved without a doubt that she is still among the best the UK has to offer in terms of actresses under the age of 40. Plus she is only 3 months younger than me, so basically my age. Here she plays Katharine Gun and before I get too much into detail explaining who Mrs. Gun is and why she did what she did, let me just say she is basically the British female equivalent to Mr. Edward Snowden. This summarizes the premise really well I would say and I will talk a bit more later on about everything that happens after she becomes a whistleblower. But as for the film, it needs to be said that you will probably recognize more faces. Matthew Goode I like as always, even if he was a bit tough to identify at times here. Former Doctor Who Matt Smith I am not really that big on, but that is just personal taste. Rhys Ifans is also easy to identify as always. And then there is Ralph Fiennes, who plays a major supporting character in the second half of the film, namely the main character's lawyer. He is a big name obviously, so he is the only one who gets scenes without Knightley's character too because he has the star potential. We see him outside with his wife in the nature and at the very end it is even him who gets the final scene when he is fishing and talking to a man who is his friend as well as rival.But now back to Knightley. I must admit I struggled a bit with the film early on. The introduction, so basically everyhing before her really getting the document out did not impress me too much. They were basically showing us her family, her friends and, most importantly, her political attitude and how she disagrees considerably with (then) Prime Minister Tony Blair's foreign policy. It was too much of the same I would say. And when the character is screaming at the television, it almost felt a bit too much and slightly cringeworthy and I thought about that more than about her dedication. Glad her husband saw it the same. But luckily, the film gets better and better afterwards. I could mention so many scenes and moments that had me on the edge of my seat. Be it the actual act when she prints the email. The interrogation. The moment she goes in there and confesses to help out her friend. The relationship with her husband. The moment when her husband is forced to leave the country. The legal ideas she discusses with Fiennes' character. The Scotland Yard fellows. The idea that she is not allowed to talk about her job. And finally of course the moment at court. Which is really nothing but a moment with what happens there. Now that was totally unexpected. I guess in my personal case it also helped that here in Germany, there simply wasn't as much talk about her as there was about Snowden or Assange for example, so I did not know if she would get convicted. But the actual explanation that in order to convict her, they would have to expose highly classified government documentation that could really cause a lot more harm potentially than Gun (funny this is her name) getting free. Very smart, very well done.So mission accomplished for the filmmakers here. I enjoyed the watch and I also learnt quite a bit here and I am certainly curious too see what Gun has done since then. So don't be distracted by the sub-par beginning when it comes to this film. Keep watching. You will not regret it at all. At this point, I would say it is one of my top5 2019 movies and maybe the best political thriller I have seen all year. Really nice that there are new developments happening constantly, so that we get films like these based on actual events. Obviously, there is a lot fictionalizing in here, but it doesn't matter. At its core, it is based on real events and characters. I would even say that I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed Spotlight a few years ago and as the latter won Best Picture at the Oscars, that certainly means quite something. Now, this one here will definitely not achieve the same, but I am positive it will get a great deal of awards recognition nonetheless. The subject is definitely one in terms of political contents and political spectrum that (liberal) awards bodies will eat up immediately and I am sure this film will score many many BAFTA nominations, perhaps also get in once or twice at the Oscars. I mean there are many many Brits at the Academy. As for the acting, nobody has a real chance except Knightley and it would be nice if she manages. Fiennes definitely won't. He is solid as always and the epitome of a supporting character, like really supporting the protagonist, but the material is simply not baity enough, even if he was smartly written. Oh yeah, fans of the television series Episodes will also be positively surprised here. It was kinda baffling really because I thought the scene before Tamsin Greig actually showed up that she would be a good casting decision for that other female character working for the non-profit lawyer's office. Okay, I am sure that if it wasn't like 10 hours already almost since I watched the movie I could make a few more statements and comments on specific scenes, but there really is no need to because you will see the makers' attention to detail constantly when watching this movie. And you should definitely go for it. I highly recommend checking it out. Big thumbs-up.",Official Secrets
3,Prismark10,Official Secrets,5,10 November 2019,"Official Secrets might be based on a true story. It never musters any energy to be an effective thriller.Instead this is a glorified television movie. A drab docudrama on the run up to the second invasion of Iraq by western forces in 2003.Keira Knightley unglams and gives a muted performance as Katharine Gun, a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham. Having come across an email that showed the American government were bugging the United Nations offices of six countries that could swing a UN Security Council resolution to invade Iraq.Gun who opposed the impending war, broke the Official Secrets Act and gave the email to a friend in the anti war movement who in turn passed it own to a journalist at the Observer newspaper.Eventually Gun is charged and her Kurdish husband is at risk of deportation.The nature of the true events means this is a plodding drama. Like an infamous dossier released by the then Labour government in the run up to the war. This could had done with some sexing up.Gun actually is portrayed as someone who is a bit dim rather than some crusader. The newspaper scenes are more effective.",Official Secrets
4,nogodnomasters,I ran it through spell check,7,29 November 2019,"This is an interesting true story other than Kiera Knightly doesn't look anything like Katherine Gun, but did star in The Imitation Game. While working for GCHQ in 2003 she discovers a top-secret memo from the US wanting help in gathering blackmail information on UN Security Council members who might vote against the war in Iraq. Such a vote was necessary for Britain to go to war. The film has her disclose the memo, it goes to the London Observer who attempts to verify it as The Drudge Report claims the authentic memo is false. (How can one guy be 100% wrong 100% of the time?)There wasn't much courtroom drama and in fact, we knew that she would fail and we would go to war. It is interesting to see how things operated. The story was well done. Well acted. But even still wasn't much of a film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Official Secrets
5,kosmasp,You can't handle the truth,8,15 March 2020,"Well when I say you, I don't mean the dear viewer of the movie (hopefully), but those who were entangled in a cover up. Something that came to light anyway, but how and when might be a different story. Or not, depending on how much you are aware of - what happened in real life.This is not a documentary though, so I can't attest to what was heightened for the film and its purposes to entertain and build suspense. Still the overall thing and how some fights seem unwinable ... it takes a toll while watching for sure. Keira Knightley is really good in this and overall the acting is great. The story is a ""bummer"", but that's life, isn't it?",Official Secrets

7,classicsoncall,"""All of this information is top secret.""",8,8 August 2020,"This movie has me revising my opinion on the legality of the Iraq War, so that by itself says the story was effectively told. Still, if governments lie, you can also ask yourself what agenda film makers have when they release a movie like this. And if I'm willing to have my opinion changed about a particular historical event, then what does that say about the information overload that comes one's way from other various sources. Somewhere in there is the fake news we should all be concerned about. What's remarkable to me after all was said and done, was how the British government dropped their case against Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley) to avoid the notoriety the exposé would bring, not to mention the unrealistic prospect of getting a conviction. The irony of the story for me is the repeatedly mentioned name without ever seeing the face of the man named Frank Koza, the NSA's Head of Regional Targets in the U.S. In Polish, the word 'koza' means 'goat', and I couldn't help thinking that the description totally fit for a guy who's blanket e-mail to an entire staff at GCHQ wound up being the basis for the entire whistle blower enterprise.",Official Secrets
8,blanche-2,fantastic story about a woman with principles,9,18 December 2019,"""Official Secrets"" is a true story about a woman, Katherine Gun, working for the British government. One day she sees a memo from the US and realizes that Bush and Blair want to go after Saddam Hussein and not the person behind 9/11, Osama bin Laden, and that they need to somehow get 9 votes from the UN. By hook or by crook. And since it's the government, it's by crook.Very upset, Katherine shows the memo to a friend who knows journalists. She hopes there will be an investigation. The next thing she knows, the memo is plastered all over the front page of a newspaper. As her colleagues are suspected and questioned, Katherine admits she is the leak and is arrested. And she refuses to plead guilty.This is an amazing film about a woman who is angered by the idea that thousands of people will be killed in an illegal and unnecessary war. Keira Knightley does a tremendous job of capturing the fear, the misery, and the bravery of Katherine Gun, with pressure coming at her to plead not guilty, attempts to deport her husband, and making her wait months to find out whether or not she will be charged.Knightley has wonderful support from Ralph Fiennes, Matthew Goode, Matthew Smith, Adam Bakri, and others.In today's world, it's great to see a true story of someone with integrity, since there is so little of it today. Highly recommended.",Official Secrets
9,CinemaSerf,"At times, quite thought-provoking",7,12 November 2019,"I think it is difficult for an actor to portray a living subject that was (in the UK, anyway) subject to such public scrutiny at the time of an investigation - objectively. There is always the temptation to sensationalise and/or glorify their activities. In this film, though, Keira Knightley does rather pull it off - her dowdy, ordinary, look coupled with a tight screenplay and some good supporting performances from Adam Bakri (who was good in ""Omar"") and Ralph Fiennes left me feeling sympathies with her truth agenda in a way that some of the more recent, bigger-budget films (""The Report"" being the most recent) didn't. It is a little slow at times and the characterisation of the newspaper journalists lacked any semblance of sophistication. The topic will divide opinion for years to come, but this provides for an interesting discourse on personal v national priorities, values and choices.",Official Secrets
10,writers_reign,Give A Little Whistle,6,21 October 2019,"Normally I endure rather than enjoy any film that features Keira Knightly and there's usually a solid reason other than Knightly, like the writer - Tolstoy, anyone - but here she is much easier to take possibly because she is portaying a real person who is still very much alive leaving little or no room for her 'look at me, mummy, I'm actually not only getting paid but also getting top billing with no discernible talent to justify either' trope. Again, surrounded by real actors who make her look competent minimum demands are made on her limited-to-non-existent thespic abilities. For a dialogue heavy film it's relatively painless.",Official Secrets
11,ferguson-6,true dilemma,6,30 August 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Doing the right thing is usually pretty easy. However a person's true character is revealed when it's not so easy. In 2003, doing the right thing became very difficult for Brit Katharine Gun. How difficult? Well, her decision could jeopardize her job. It's a decision that could get her husband deported. Making the choice could expose two powerful international governments and send her to prison for many years. And if that's not enough risk, how about a decision that could lead to a huge (possibly illegal) war, costing thousands of lives? So you know what Katharine Gun did? She did the right thing.Keira Knightley stars as Katharine Gun. The film opens in 2004 with her facing a British court and the moment of her plea. We then flashback one year to see Katharine working as a staff member of GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters). She spends her days translating and compiling intelligence for the British Government. It's a job that requires the utmost discretion and the contractual obligation to keep work secrets at work. One day she reads a top secret memo making it clear that governments were conspiring to manipulate a United Nations vote required to authorize an invasion of Iraq.Based on the (lengthy titled) book ""The Spy who Tried to Stop a War: Katharine Gun and the Secret Plot to Sanction the Iraq Invasion"" by Martha Mitchell and Thomas Mitchell, the film is directed by Gavin Hood (the excellent TSOTSI, 2005) who co-wrote the screenplay with Gregory Bernstein and Sara Bernstein. It's presented as a moral quandary for Katharine. Say nothing and maintain the status quo in her personal and professional life, or speak up and risk everything noted above. We see Katharine's impulsive decision-making, and behavior that would rank her among history's least likely successful spies. It's actually her naivety that guides her to speak up.The media side is also addressed here, and although some terrific actors are involved, this segment is the film's slickest and least realistic. Matt Smith plays political reporter Martin Bright and Rhys Ifans plays Ed Volliamy. The two journalists for ""The Observer"" worked together to verify the memo leaked by Ms. Gun, and Matthew Goode is Peter Beaumont, the editor who pushed to run the story. Previously, the paper had been an avid supporter of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and took many of their stories directly from information provided by his office. Running the story exposed the paper to scrutiny that it was not accustomed to.Where the film excels is in exploring Katharine's personal turmoil. It's also where it fails us as viewers. As her personal story, the subject matter is a unique and rare look at the wheels of government intelligence. Unfortunately, an inordinate amount of time is spent on the media and reporting, and not enough on what emotional torture the year of waiting must have been for her. Ralph Fiennes plays Ben Emmerson, the lead attorney for Liberty - the legal organization who takes on Katharine's case. It's the legal wranglings of this complex case that make for extraordinary drama, and the fallout of her personal choices had the potential for disaster. All of this is covered in a cursory manner, when more detail would have added more heft to a fascinating story. This includes her run-ins with an MI5 agent played superbly by Peter Guiness. The Official Secrets Act of 1989 is mentioned about 10 times, even though we understand pretty quickly that actions against this law likely results in treason. Ms. Gun is a hero for exposing illegal government activity, and a more intimate look at her personal turmoil would have provided more suspense and a better connection for the viewer.",Official Secrets
12,phd_travel,This is a good movie especially the latter half- so watch it,8,7 November 2019,It is wonderful now that enough time has passed that movies are being made about the heroes and heroines who tried to stop the Iraq war and tragically failed. With such a good cast and the subject matter of whistle blowing how can this not be a good movie. That's why I couldn't believe negative reviews.The earlier part shows the doubt a whistle blower faces and the consequences on their lives. The latter part is very involving when they put together her defence and the shocking ending leaves such a wonderful feeling. Of course by then the WMD fiasco had already come to light.Keira is prettier here than in some of her other movies. She looks great with less makeup and less smiling. She acts well and when she delivers her justifications it's quite believable. She makes this movie watchable. Look out for a bevy of top actors from Ralph Fiennes as her lawyer to Matthew Goode with a bad crew cut and Matt Smith as a journalist.It's a timely look at whistle blowing and the tragedy of the Iraq War and a woman's journey from alleged traitor to heroine.,Official Secrets

Information such as this may be known to some - the 2003 debacle of the sanctioning of the invasion of Iraq exposed by whistleblower Katherine Gun as an illegal NSA spy operation - but seeing realized in such a skillful manner make the impact of this historical moment even more significant. The pacing of the film is on target, speedy but still allowing enough development of the individual characters involved to make the story all the more credible and fascinating.Films such as this are invaluable reminders of how governments can ill-function at times and how war is never an event to consider lightly.

14,deloudelouvain,Respect to the whistleblowers.,8,30 December 2019,"If there is something to be learned from a biography/movie like Official Secrets is that we should have a immense respect for all kind of whistleblowers, people that risk everything just by exposing an ugly truth, a truth we are all allowed or should be obliged to know. Governments spying illegally on us, breaching our rights of privacy, twisting the truth and telling lies in order to better themselves or certain enterprises, it should all be made public and those whistleblowers should be rewarded instead of being put on trial. Official Secrets is a poignant story, very well shot, with a very good cast. Keira Knightley excels in playing her character Katharine Gun. For a crime drama it's one of the better ones, and being it based on a true story makes it even better. A must watch, certainly for all the sheep that think things like this don't happen on daily basis.",Official Secrets
15,siderite,Formulaic star driven movie about a British whistleblower that exposed British subservience to US interests,8,9 January 2021,"It's good, but formulaic, like all movies of this sort. I wonder whether the ultimate goal is to inspire people or to let them be brutally aware that leaking secrets relevant to public safety means that:
entire governments will come after you and everyone you care aboutspecial laws will have been written for people like you that only apply to youreporters will check that the people involved exist (which will be denied on grounds of national security)reports will check that the info is real (which they will not legally have access to)the media organizations you contact will not have expressed an opinion opposite of what your information leads tothe media organizations and reporters you contact are not under surveillance themselvesthe media organizations and reporters you contact are not going to crack under pressurethe reporting itself will be allowed by the apparatus of lawyou have nothing to gain personally and everything to loseAnd every time someone succeeds, they pour unlimited resources to study the case and stop anything like that happen again.

16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Riveting modern day real life thriller,9,23 October 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 2003, Katherine Gun (Keira Knightley), an employee of GCHQ, came across sensitive information suggesting America was putting pressure on the British government to gather spurious information to justify the invasion of Iraq. Already a fierce opponent of any military intervention, Katherine found herself compelled to act, and leaked information of this news to The Observer newspaper. When she was forced to reveal herself as the leaker, Katherine was plunged into a devastating spiral of events that threatened to rip her life apart.It's a depressing moment when things you can remember happening very clearly at a fully developed point in your life have suddenly happened a very long time ago, and now have some kind of historical context to them. Even though the invasion of Iraq happened sixteen years ago, when I was a much younger man, considering the course of time that modern films can still engagingly cover, it's a pretty recent thing, and definitely one that there's still loads of interest in. And director Gavin Hood has seized upon that with this dramatization of a 'whistle blower' who was instrumental in exposing how corrupt the whole thing was.Despite a pretty slow and dull beginning, that makes it feel more suited to a Sunday afternoon TV drama than a big screen affair, it gradually develops into something more riveting and compelling, really delving into all the juicy background corruption that went on behind our backs in the build-up to that war. Hood saturates the whole thing in a blurry, drained out camera style that allows for no respite from all the dramatic events unfolding. Knightley is reliably strong and commanding in the lead role, as a courageous young woman who pays a terrible price for confronting the powers that be, with stellar support from the likes of Matthew Goode, Ralph Fiennes, Matt Smith and Adam Bakri.This is the sort of adult, mature filmmaking people don't have so much time for these days, and will no doubt be out of theatres in no time, a shame since director Hood has delivered an impressive film, which, while not quite matching the nail biting tension of his previous military thriller Eye in the Sky, is still a shattering, uncomfortable indictment of how the state will persecute anyone who goes against it's wishes. ****",Official Secrets

Official Secrets does it well, bolstered by yet another great (period piece) performance from Keira Knightley. This film may not be revered as much as All the President's Men or Spotlight but it's up there for me.

As the movie opens, it is ""25 February 2004, London"", and Gun is appearing in court. ""As to the charge regarding the Official Secrets Act, do you please guilty or no guilty?, the court asks her. We then go ""One Year Earlier, Cheltenham"", as we get to know Gun, as she is watching Tony Blair on TV making the case for the war on Iraq. She works a the Government Communications Headquarters. Gun happens to get some very sensitive information regarding attempts to influence the votes of certain members of the UN Security Council. Gun is very upset and decides to leak the information... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see fort yourself how it all p[lays out.Couple of comments: the movie is directed by veteran South African director (and co-writer) Gavin Hood (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""). Here he brings the real life story of what happened to Katharine Gun. As we all know at this point, the Bush administration outright lied and manipulated the data so as to make the case for invading Iraq. The Blair administration wasn't much better. The movie is hence on the right side of the truth, but of course that is easy to do with 20/20 hindsight. Apart from the whistleblower case, the movie also brings to the front what happened at the Observer, the British newspaper that published the sensitive data. I quite enjoyed it all, and not only because I couldn't wait to find out how it would all end for Gun. Kiera Knightly plays Katharine Gun, and she plays it with passion and with determination. She is an absolute delight to watch her carry this movie on her shoulders. Ralph Fiennes is equally up to the task (as the non-profit lawyer representing Gun).""Official Secrets"" premiered to positive acclaim at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The movie opened on 2 or 3 screens in all of Greater Cincinnati this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely (about 25 people). If you have any interest in whisleblower cases or how the US and UK administration misled the public about the war in Iraq, I'd readily suggest you check out ""Official Secrets"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Official Secrets
23,subxerogravity,A long yarn of information but I found it interesting,7,7 September 2019,"It's slow and it's quiet but neither of these things make for a boring movie. The I information the story is putting out there is actually intriguing enough to keep me very interesting. I think that's a really good sign of a movie that's technically espionage, technically a drama about journalism and technically a court room drama.
It's funny, they show images of the woman this movie is based on. Not only does she look nothing like Kera knightley but they could have easily found an actress to play her blonde haired blue eyed type. Although knightley did nicely in the role. Also worth it to see Raplh fines in it.

25,stevendbeard,Interesting But Slow,6,30 September 2019,"I saw ""Official Secrets"", starring Keira Knightley-The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, The Imitation Game; Matt Smith-Doctor Who_tv, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies; Matthew Goode-The Good Wife_tv, The Imitation Game and Ralph Fiennes-Spectre, Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter movies.
This movie is based on a true story about a British whistleblower named Katharine Gun, who blew the lid off of an illegal NSA operation to start the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Keira plays Katharine, the British worker that discovered a document that showed the U.S. and British governments trying to bypass the United Nations Council in order to start the Iraq war. She got the document into the hands of two London reporters, Matt & Matthew, who tried to verify it's authenticity. Keira was then faced with jail time for releasing the document, seeing as how she had broken the Official Secrets Act of her government. Ralph plays her lawyer. It's an interesting story, although a little slow moving.
It's rated ""R"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes.
It's not one that I would but on DVD. I wouldn't rent it, either-did I mention it was slow? If you are interested in seeing it, I would wait until it comes to cable.",Official Secrets

28,TdSmth5,Should have been more exciting,7,9 October 2019,"Katharine Gun is an analyist at GCHQ, the English version of the NSA. She listens to and translates Chinese communications. She's married to an Iraqi Kurd and is friends with an Asian girl and some guy at work. This is after 9/11 and Tony Blair and W Bush are already agitating for war. One day she, and everyone else in her department, gets a memo from NSA requesting they try to get dirt on a couple of UN delegates who are undecided on voting for war during the second round of voting. K is outraged. She as well as others know that Saddam has no WMDs.Meanwhile reporters at The Observer are working on a variety of stories on the potential war. Some higher up is a big cheerleader for war and the editor in chief also goes along. Some US corresponded argues vehemently for the newspaper to maintain independence. There's a huge anti-war rally all over the world.K decides to pass the contents of the email memo along to an anti-war activist, who gives it to some Muslim-convert who gives it to a young reporter at the Observer. He and another journalist try to verify the veracity info without all that much success. But as the editor points out, it's one hell of a story, so he decides to publish to contents. Next day the reporter is a hero receiving requests for interviews from all over the world. Then in minutes it all falls apart. A secretary ran the story through spell-check which changed the spelling from American English to British English and thus is deemed to be a fake.Something akin to Internal Affairs starts investigating the leak and right away focuses on K's department. All the employees are interviewed. Before a second-round of interviews with a lie detector take place, K decides to admit she did it. She's arrested and then released pending a decision by the attorney general on whether to charge her or not or not for violating the Official Secrets Act.She's recommended some specialized law office. On her way there she's being followed by some not-very-covert operatives. The legal team, comprised of three people, isn't very confident in her defense. But she refuses to plead guilty. So her team goes all out. Meanwhile her husband is grabbed for deportation but saved a split-second before being deported. Her legal team gets a tip that legal council to the prime minister suggested the war would be illegal but then after traveling to America he changed his mind. That legal council is now the attorney general deciding whether to charge K. Of course the office does charge K with espionage and we meet her as she is about to enter a plea and there's something of a surprising turn of events.The story of Official Secrets sure is an interesting one; you've got spies, politics, journalism, moral dilemmas. Instead the movie focuses more on the less interesting aspects of all this: K and her lame husband. Acting is all over the place. Keira is always lovely and likeable. Ralph Fiennes as the principled attorney is oddly underwhelming, while Matt Smith and Matthew Goode stand out as the intrepid journalists.

As her lead attorney (played by Ralph Fiennes) states during the film, she risked everything for no personal gain. This us an example of integrity in the purest form. I totally understand why Keira Knightly took this role, and I am willing to bet she feels the same way. This is right up (director) Gavin Hood's alley. He's made other films with strong anti-war sentiments.That is not a criticism; its simply my ibservation. It's a solid film. For me the best part is the truth which he so clearly exposes: People New York Times wrote how President Bush was telling big fat lies about WMDs. The lasting image I will always have is when the RNC had their convention in New York City. Activists hung a tremendous sign from the atop a building on Central Park South. In huge letters it read ""BUSH"" with a giant arrow pointing to the right. Directly under his name were the words ""The Truth"", with another huge arrow pointing to the left.

The pace is excellent, with good performances of believable characters, and everything flows from a tight script with unfussy direction and editing. For all the gravity of the crimes committed and the injustice of the security state, the best scene is when the newspaper copy editor fesses up to a small yet devastating mistake.This production wears its heart on its sleeve, and the final scene is a rather classy flicking of the Vs at the establishment.

34,martimusross,Dry As Dust Biopic About A Chinese Translator,6,24 October 2019,"Official SecretsI enjoyed this movie despite it being on the driest of subjects, and the fact that it is very much a repeat of the plot of Red Joan.Keira Knightly really turned out a first rate performance here and she was quite brilliant in Aftermath. This is great news after a series of quite mediocre movies that just seemed to rely on her looks rather than her talent, Collette, Nutcracker etc. Sometimes Keira has a blank expression that conveys nothing, this could be my observation.The whole ensemble seemingly competing to dominate their respective scenes, we were spoilt with the talent here.The script was not so good I am afraid, as no justification can ever be given for committing acts of treason, particularly from a partial viewpoint. The trial was halted because the government really couldn't be bothered making a principled argument over one, yes one leaked memo, she had been dismissed and her career was in ruins, punishment enough. The movie suggested it was about divulging documents but the decision not to prosecute came before this request. In Red Joan she had a lifetime of traitorous acts that cost lives and they dropped the case due to her age.I think this movie was written by a Guardian reader for a Guardian reader, a paper I can't bear due to the multiplicity of typing mistakes.",Official Secrets
35,MR_Heraclius,Official Secrets,10,11 February 2020,"If you want to become freshly enraged about the massive war crime we call the Iraq war, go see this film. Perhaps the most emotionally distressing aspect is the underlying knowledge that absolutely nothing has changed on any level of power, in any way, since this extraordinary deception.Bush and Blair continue to be celebrated in high society.Intelligence agencies continue to illicitly gather compromising material to use as blackmail and extortion on people who might stand in the way of this war-for-profit gravy train.We continue to be deliberately and criminally deceived about these so-called humanitarian wars by a media that continues their fawning sycophantic support of the war-loving establishment.The butchery-for-Raytheon profits continue with no end in sight.It's a great yarn well told, Knightly is perfect as Katharine Gun, and it has a lot of very interesting old footage from the time which will have you shouting at the screen in frustration.

In case you've forgotten, that war was started under the false premise that Iraq had ""weapons of mass destruction"" and they were planning to use them with anti-western forces top launch attacks. Both allegations were blatant lies, trumped up by the Bush administration, but at the time, many people believed them and in fact, the US and the Brits went to war with hundreds of thousands of casualties.The film is slow paced but the acting is excellent, especially from Ralph Fiennes who seems to utterly disappear into his roles.

40,agmoldham,Really Enjoyable,7,23 October 2019,"Official Secrets studies the events that are happening in intelligence during the run up to the second gulf war. Having lived through the times myself was aware of the background to the movie, but unaware of the specific story that it explores.Keira Knightly plays Katharine Gun who works at GCHQ collecting intelligence for the UK. She is concerned about the accuracy of the intelligence that is being used to prove the case for war. The British and American government need a resolution passing at the United Nations to legitimize the war. A memo is distributed to collect intelligence on the United Nations members that can be used to coax them into voting for the resolution. She is shocked by this and wants to stop the war.In the same way that Brexit dominates British news at the moment WMD's dominated the next back then. The movie is good and shows the pressure that everybody is under. You get the chance to wonder whether you would make the same decisions as Katharine and whether she was right to do it.I've never been a big fan of Knightly, but she does a fine job in Official Secrets. Well worth a watch.",Official Secrets
41,jrarichards,"Ultimately justified as a film, rather than a documentary, but...",8,19 January 2020,"Having been on my own kind of (pretty depressing) journey towards fuller enlightenment about our world, I am inclined to see Oriental linguist-cum-eavesdropper Katherine Gun based at Britain's super-efficient General Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in the country town of Cheltenham as a bit of a hero; where at the time (that's 16+ years ago in 2003) I might have been much more critical of her leaking/justifiable whistleblowing.But there are plenty of questions to be asked about a film like Gavin Hood's ""Official Secrets"", which recreates the relevant events above in their Second Gulf War/post-9/11 context, and even deploys real-life news clips featuring British PM Tony Blair, George W. Bush, Colin Powell and so on. And first among those questions must therefore be, can an acted film (or maybe even should an acted film) do this job, when a well-made documentary is another (theoretically more valid) option?On balance, I'm going to answer ""yes"", and that's in part because of what Keira Knightley is able to bring to any of her gutsy, determined-yet-conflicted roles. Here she plays Katherine Gun as a principled patriot, not especially heroic but moral, who swears that she is not just anti-war under all circumstances, and is also entirely plausible as someone not soft on Saddam, given that her husband Yasar (here played by Adam Bakri) is actually an Iraqi Kurd!You couldn't make it up...Film as opposed to documentary also benefits from a pretty glorious if brief scene acted out on the South Coast of England in the context of a sea fishing trip and featuring ever-reliable heavyweights Jeremy Northam and Ralph Fiennes as two lawyers in conflict - the former being the UK's Director of Public Prosecutions Ken MacDonald and the latter being Gun's defence from ""Liberty"" Ben Emmerson. The scene makes it clear how the state was ready to ""play games with"" Gun and her case, and there are various other parts of the film in which it is clear that different (somewhat) dirty tricks are being resorted to, to make things difficult for Gun, and to discourage others from imitating her actions. The trial that ultimately takes place was as it was, and I shall offer no spoilers, but a rather beautiful moment in the film shows how a confused and panicky Gun did what all Brits do - and turned to her MP (that was Nigel Jones, here played by Chris Larkin). Jones - now Lord Jones of Cheltenham - was a Lib Dem Member (an MP for that constituency for 13 years), and the film suggests he WAS able to help out a bit - a reassuring tribute to British democracy set against the otherwise-somewhat-worrying hints at an all-powerful state.Nevertheless, the best dramatic work done in this movie revolves around a fine, tense and plausible-looking recreation of the situation at ""The Observer"" newspaper (left-leaning and theoretically supportive of Blair), which had already come out as in favour of the justified war and then had to consider whether it should or should not go with the story leaked by Gun - an email from somebody called Frank Koza at the NSA by which the US was asking the UK to do all in its dirty-tricks power to get hooks into UN Security Council Representatives, in order that they might be more inclined to supply a fresh pro-war-in-Iraq Resolution (the one that never actually materialised, in fact). This is set in the midst of Gun's growing conviction that a bloody and victim-full War against Saddam, though possibly justified (as she asserts), is being embarked upon on the basis of lies, with the British people having no access to the real background truth.That situation crystallises in the Observer's newsroom, around journalist Martin Bright, who is really well played here by Matt Smith. Bright has fellow journalists and contacts (all well-acted), and the way his not-at-all-convinced Editor makes them all do the fact-checking and digging is fascinating.And ultimate publication does not prove trouble-free!These (at times America-based) parts of the film also hint at the way pressure for war was being applied through the Neo-Con American regime, and how that narrative tuned and motivated vis-a-vis the American people and t hus nothing directly to do with the United Kingdom was nevertheless being forced upon the latter. How much of that was down to Bush-Blair, and how much Cheney-Rumsfeld, or even further and deeper into that finger-in-every-pie group of ""Project for a New American Century"" authors is beyond the scope of this movie, but by no means irrelevant to its content.Many of us out here have been angered and troubled by all of that for a long time, even as we of course support ""our boys"" and do not throw the baby out with the bathwater - recognising that Saddam ""had to go"". But if he was so bad, why did America extend at least half-hearted support to him in the context of the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-88, when Henry Kissinger did admittedly say quite openly that it was a pity that both sides could not lose??!!Like millions of us, Gun wanted what may be (but should not be) the impossible - that our side be the good guys, pursuing war only when we have to, and with right and decency ... and honesty. Ultimately, that does not sound too much to ask or expect of the United Kingdom ... or even the United States.",Official Secrets

You hopefully have seen the movies 'Green Zone' in 2010 or perhaps caught a glimpse into the mind of one of the war's architect in the 2018 movie 'Vice'. In this film, I discovered yet another aspect or truth of the one reality we experienced on both sides of the pond, the big lie that lead to an unjust and illegal war. With 'Official Secrets' the story is not that of the Bush Administration's shameful manipulation to pretext the war, but the coercion by that administration to get Britain on board and the willing collusion by the UK's Prime Minister's administration, which collaboration made it possible for the war to have UN support.A lone intelligence researcher bureaucrat hears lies on tv and through her work decides to research the matter, uncovers evidence disproving the official government narrative and takes the solemn decision to expose the truth in hopes to prevent exactly what came to pass, the war and high cost of lives she knew it would entail. She admitted her action and was ready to face terrible punishment to expose the truth, a shining example of the good whistleblower.In America we heard very little of this story if at all, so the movie brought it to my attention and hopefully many others. I wish the scenes dealing with the newspaper and reporters had more bite to them, those were not the impressive parts of the movie. It was the experience and torment of the whistleblower Katharine Gun, played by Keira Knightley that impressed me. The few, too few, scenes featuring the character Ben Emmerson, played by Ralph Fiennes were another reason I liked the movie. As many other reviewers mentioned, the very last scene featuring Fiennes was a gem, well scripted, directed and very well delivered.The end, as many movies about real events do, displays written update information that are sure to bring the gravity of what the lies cost. In 2010, Lord Goldsmith's (England Attorney General) advice to Tony Blair, at the time Katherine Gun leaked the memo, was made public. Goldsmith had clearly advised war would be illegal without a new UN Security Council resolution. Estimates of Iraqis killed during the first four years of the Iraq War range from 151,000 to 1 million; countless more were wounded. I'd called them innocent victims. Over 4,600 US and British soldiers died, more than 37,700 were wounded.",Official Secrets

Increasing numbers of real world whistleblowers surely gives them the motivation to do so. Personally I think these kind of movies have much more responsibilities towards the audience than any other genre. As the real facts/incidents are used; people look out to those in order get some reference relating to those specific issues. And The makers do need to be courageous and Bold in attempt to showcase such atrocities and harsh truths that had really took place. Kudos to them for taking such risks for the ultimate truth that everyone should know. As a Film it succeeded on so many terms. Performances were grabbing, Screenplay looked polish, Dialogues are well maintained and thoroughly researched and put together facts. They surely make this film a solid watch for the Socio-political fans. But I feel this film would be more relatable to the people of USA and UK cause of their parts in the actual event. As a Foreign Audience; it didn't really appeal to me as much as I wanted it to! I couldn't really connect to the main leads in the film as I felt their characterization fell short. The depth in them surely lacked and Failed to grab my attention! The first 30 Minutes Felt little stretched and The Climax didn't give me enough satisfaction as well. Although Keira Knightley as Katharine shined through and solely carried the film on her shoulders. But the other characters didn't impress much. Her Husband Yasar, The Journalist guy Martin; their respective roles were underwhelming. To be honest I haven't seen much Political thrillers in the past except few. And 'Snowden' is still my favorite among them. This comes nothing closer to that. A Fine watch but Nothing sensational in my humble opinion.",Official Secrets
45,maccas-56367,Possibly Keira Knightley's greatest performance,9,6 October 2020,"I really enjoyed this one. Quite possibly Keira Knightley's greatest performance and an important true story to boot!The film sees Brit intelligence specialist Katharine Gun leak a memo to the press (Martin Bright). The memo basically directed British intelligence to spy on (and blackmail) UN security council members - so they would vote in favour of an Iraq War (thereby making it legal etc).These types of films can often be quite confusing. I thought Official Secrets delivered the story quite effectively in an easy-to-understand and digest way. I found myself completely engrossed and invested in the plight of Katharine.The wonderful performances by a seriously all-star cast certainly helped keep me engaged. Besides Keira Knightley at her best, ""Official Secrets"" features Matt Smith (ol' Prince Philip from ""The Crown""), a dishevelled Rhys Ifans (impossible to dislike), Matthew Goode and Ralph Fiennes (uncharacteristically as a good guy!). Even ""Black Books"" Tamsin Greig made an appearance.""Official Secrets"" is not only a film about real life events, but about staying true to yourself and your values. Standing up for what we believe is right. It's powerful stuff.Kind of felt a bit like ""Spotlight"" meets ""Denial"".

Our government lied to us and the British public deserved to know about that lie. For that point, the film is worth watching. However, as a film per se, it's a bit meh. There's way too much time 'relationship time' between Katharine and her husband. It's a bit zzz. They could have cut 20 mins of that dull part and the film would have been stronger. I started fast forwarding through the 'relationship' bits just to get back to the legal case. That's why I've marked it a 6/10. Having said that, it's worth watching though just to see how Tony Blair lied to us. The only consolation I can take from the whole Iraq war is that Mr Blair is now the most despised man in the UK. He'll always be remembered in the UK as the man who took Britain into an illegal war. That gives me some comfort.",Official Secrets

49,CineMuseFilms,a tense whistle-blower morality play,8,26 June 2019,"The release of Official Secrets (2019) coincides with the current US President telling the world he gladly accepts intelligence dirt on political opponents irrespective of source. With impeccable timing, the film shows how such dirt-gathering can potentially impact the course of history.Based on real events, Katharine Gun (Keira Knightly) is a surveillance employee in Britain's Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ). In early 2003, she sees an email from an American intelligence agency seeking British support to illegally pressure six UN Security Council swing-states for war with Iraq (falsely claiming it possessed weapons of mass destruction). Highly principled and anti-war, Katharine passes on the email to a friend with journalist connections and within weeks it is on the front pages. She confesses her crime, and for the next year, her life is hell as she awaits trial under the Official Secrets Act.If you have little interest in global politics or major world events, you may get lost in this dialogue-driven moral rights story. It is crafted into several narrative segments: Katharine's relationship to her Muslim immigrant husband; her relations with GCHQ colleagues; the role of The Observer newspaper; and legal arguments by defence and prosecution lawyers. Each is a separate and engaging story that culminates in a shock trial outcome in early 2004.Official Secrets works at several levels, but it is Keira Knightly who keeps the film together. She exudes an effortless screen presence that holds audience attention despite an uncharacteristically understated performance. This ensures that attention is drawn away from herself to keep the spotlight on the morality of whistleblowing and the duplicity of US and British action in manipulating due process. Archival material on Tony Blair, George W. Bush, and Saddam Hussein defines the story's time and place with authenticity. The script is dense with explanation and legal argument but, at the core, it is a story of one individual who believes an illegal war is about to be declared and cannot bear the moral responsibility of doing nothing.Much of the action takes place in The Observer newsroom as reporters grapple with the enormity of the information leak, the legal consequences of going to press, and the implications of silence. The interplay of commercial, legal, and political imperatives is well drawn by an excellent supporting cast and a filming style evocative of the loneliness that comes from being one voice standing on principle.There continues to be real-life morality dramas involving high-profile whistle-blowers around the world, and the public is divided on whether they are heroes or villains. This film may help you decide.",Official Secrets
50,akcenat,Very good (UK) government whistleblower movie,8,15 December 2019,"""Official Secrets"" tells the true story of a translator for British Intelligence, who in 2003 leaked to the press an NSA memo in which the US tried to sway the UN Security Council to vote in favor of the Iraq War. The film documents her attempt to defend herself against the charges, which paints her as being guilty of treason against her country, despite not being able to mount a defense as any testimony she would need to give would cause her to violate the law further (Official Secrets Act). This is not an exceptionally revelatory or suspenseful film. Actually, the suspense and build-up of the story best come from The Observer newspaper and Martin Bright side of the film. Also, this isn't exactly a spy story or a thriller or a courtroom drama but a little of all of these and for a while a newsroom biopic but I did liked it because it works on all those levels, although inevitably with a broad brush. It is, also, paced decently well (if slowly) while Keira Knightely here comes with a bang delivering an amazing performance as the woman who bravely takes a stand when seemingly no one else would. This is, definitely, Knightley's film and she here shines carrying it on her shoulders excellently. To conclude, this is mid-scale, sober and intelligent movie which is well shot and classy played out. Also, its a great film and a must-see recent history lesson, which is maybe 10-15 minutes longer than it was necessary.Rating: 7+/8-",Official Secrets

53,Magow-Intermean,Official Secrets,8,22 December 2019,"GCHQ worker Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley) is asked to work on a memo revealing details of strong-arm US/UK tactics designed to bully the UN security council into backing the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Feeling for the 30 million civilians who would suffer, Gun decides to leak the document to the press, putting her job and life in jeopardy.
Official Secrets is the kind of film where the most suspenseful scene is built around a grey office printer. The woman doing the printing is Katharine Gun (Knightley), the GCHQ worker who leaked a secret memo revealing a US spying campaign designed to help ratify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Eye In The Sky director Gavin Hood's is a film full of whistleblowing deliberations, political subterfuge, journalistic legwork and out-of-date tech (you should see the chunky keyboards and HUGE floppy discs), delivered by a strong cast of reliable Brits led by a particularly powerful Keira Knightley. If it's let down by a simplistic take on its complex subject matter, it's still an entertaining slice of recent history celebrating an unsung British hero.
After spending time grounding Gun's life in recognisable strokes, the film gets good dramatic mileage out of the printing of the secret memo, a tense if perhaps over-the-top visit to the postbox where Gun is paranoid she is being watched and the interview scenes, which try to flush out the whistle-blower in GCHQ. By the time the leaked memo finds it's way to Observer journalist Martin Bright (a likable Matt Smith), it transforms into a '70s styled thriller with meetings in underground car parks, phone calls to the White House using an alias, and lots of debates about whether it is right to publish. There is also an incredibly explosive scene involving spell-check. Honestly.
It's Knightley's Gun you'll remember and admire; steely, stirring but still recognisably human.
If Official Secrets falls down it's in a lack of confidence that an audience will follow the complex machinations, constantly recapping to make sure we are all on the same page. It also falls into too many 'movie-movie' tropes, be it shout-y British newspaper editors or a last-gasp attempt to stop a key character being deported. As Katharine makes the incredibly brave decision to 'fess up and GCHQ start threatening her through Scotland Yard, she engages human-rights law firm Liberty, headed by Ben Emmerson (Ralph Fiennes, coasting but classy), to take on her case.
Hood's filmmaking is polished if a bit colourless and a raft of great British character actors (Matthew Goode, Rhys Ifans, Tamsin Greig, Jeremy Northam) do good work in under-written roles. But it's Knightley's Gun you'll remember and admire; steely, stirring but still recognisably human. At one point, Gun rails against Tony Blair on TV: ""Just because you're the Prime Minister, it doesn't mean you get to make up your own facts."" What's that line about the more things change, the more they stay the same.",Official Secrets
54,TheHoodOfSwords,Nice Thriller,7,3 June 2020,"So I know that The Report and this movie are pretty similar. Or at least have similar premises. Seeing as I wanted to watch both I decided to just ask my mom which one she wanted to watch. We decided to watch this. Going into this movie I had no clue what had happened since the movie is based around events that happened around 2003 and 2004. Since I was born in 2004 I obviously didn't learn about it. This was pretty interesting for me! I liked Snowden when I saw it so I was excited to see this since they're both about whistleblowers. I felt the tension in this film was really well done for the first 40-60 minutes of the film. The discovery of the infamous email and the mental battles that Katherine fights with about it is really compelling. I also really liked Matt Smith in this film as a reporter. That part was also really interesting. The media knew it would be disastrous if it was real so we see them do gymnastics across multiple sources to try and verify the legality of the email. However, I sadly felt it fell off a bit in the second act. While the ending picked up the tension and technicality courtroom stuff the 2nd act seems determined to make me care for characters that I really never did. Overall I would recommend this if you want to watch a pretty good thriller and a suspense-filled movie that's acted well with performances from The Eleventh Doctor, Varys and Bootleg Padme.",Official Secrets
55,movieman6-413-929510,How doing the right deed can get you in trouble unjustly.,7,13 September 2021,"Official Secrets is a new drama thriller directed and written in part by Gavin Hood the director of Eye in the Sky and X-men Origins: Wolverine.The film is about the true story of Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley), who works as an interpreter. Here she translates a memo on information about how the 2003 Iraq invasion became possible. She shares this information and so it ends up with journalist Martin Bright (Matt Smith), who shares it with the rest of the world. When asked who his source is, an investigation is launched that leads back to Katharine's company. Katharina is so faced with the choice to confess that she leaked the memo at the risk of ending up as a traitor. If she keeps quiet, the war can continue and the number of war casualties increases without the world knowing that this war could have been prevented.This film does a good job of showing how doing the right thing can unjustly get someone into trouble due to the corrupt side of government. As a result, the main character can lose everything as a result of this good deed, such as her job, marriage and eventually end up unjustly in prison.The film uses real footage of the news and how politicians reacted to it in an effort to cover up their actions. With the information now known about what certain politicians used to do that led to wrong things, this film shows how these people tried to hide this from the rest of the world. This also shows how she corruptly suppressed people who tried to share this news with the world. This also responds to current events where politicians are still doing things wrong and people get into trouble because of their mistakes.The acting is well done by the film cast. This is another of Keira Knightley's best major role in a movie since 2014's The Imitation Game. She conveys well how doing a good deed to a corrupt politician can get someone in trouble. In this way she changes her role from hero to person in hiding until the end to unjust victim. Matt Smith plays his part well too, but his character comes across more as an intermediate role who ends up sharing the main character's actions with the world in a bigger way. Later in the film, Ralph Fiennes also plays the role of Katharine her lawyer, who tries to ensure justice despite everything.",Official Secrets

As someone very young when the US went to war with Iraq, I found this film very interesting. It was also interesting to see the events from the British point of view. However, more than the historical facts, I found that the personal story of Katharine Gun very interesting. You know, watching the film that the war will happen, but you don't know what is going to happen to Katharine. To what extent do we have the right to question what our governments do? I couldn't help but wonder what I would do in that situation. Would I be willing to risk everything for what I believed in? Keira Knightly is simply amazing in this role. It is one of her best performances, and it is arguably even her best. She really does an amazing job at portraying the emotional roller coaster that the real person probably went through as well as the personal strain she had to go through. I particularly found her explanation for why she did what she did was fantastic, and the scene showing the war beginning and Katharine was heartbreaking. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. There isn't a bad performance among the group. It's not an action-packed film, but it serves as an important reminder that governments can make mistakes and that we as individuals are responsible for doing the right thing. Hopefully, this movie stands as a reminder to all politicians that regardless of their potion, ""it doesn't mean you get to make up your own facts.""",Official Secrets

69,azanti0029,Well researched and truthful account of one person who tried to stop the illegal war with Iraq,9,6 November 2019,"In the lead up to the war with Iraq which only the most dense and demented of people can't comprehend was an entirely illegal war based on an agenda pushed false premise from souped up intelligence, there were a number of decent human beings in position of importance who were able to leak to the press what was going on. In the case of one such person, a low level analyst for British Intelligence at GCHQ, she decided to do something about it, thus information was leaked to the press from a credible source where it was revealed the USA intelligence apparatus was listening into various UN council members in order to try and push the resolution for war with Iraq.Thus Official Secrets tells this story with Keria Knightley (One of her best performances) as said analyst with the moral dilemma. The always dependable Matt Smith plays the Journo at the Observer newspaper who decides to blow the story, a paper which until that point had supported Tony Blairs agenda to go to war with Iraq. If you want the proof that Blair lied to the British people to suit his own agenda then look no further than this story (And don't take the films word for it, all the facts are out there to be found) And if any film illustrates more how such a man could have in fact gone down in history as one of the world's great leaders if he had said 'no' to the American agenda and listened to the British people, then its this one.Gun, the analyst seeks neither publicity nor recognition for her actions but found it none the less. The collective cast of established British names make this drama very believable and play their characters with conviction. While it might not be the most gripping narrative it is never the less a vital history lesson and one that should be seen and appreciated the fully understand the courage of those involved.

70,Sasha_Lauren,"Important, well done film about government lies that led to Iraq war - Keira Knightly was excellent",9,10 January 2020,"Katherine Gun needed a job. She saw an ad for an opening at Government Communications Headquarters, a British Intelligence Agency. She didn't fully know what they did, but, having grown up in Taiwan, she got hired as an interpreter.In 2003, in her position with the GCHQ, Kathryn and other collegues received an email memo from Frank Koza, chief of staff in the ""Regional Targets"" section of the National Security Agency, that he sent to senior NSA officials in Britain ordering staff to conduct aggressive, covert surveillance of United Nations Security Council members from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea, and Pakistan, known as the ""Middle Six,"" because they were the swing nations. The aim was to collect compromising information to blackmail the delegates in order to get them to support the invasion of Iraq in the UN Resolution Vote.This surveillance was reportedly ordered by George W. Bush and his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and supported by Prime Minister, Tony Blair.Katherine, (played by Keira Knightly in a strong performance), was outraged and alarmed by this illegal pursuit aimed at justifying the Iraq War - a war in which perhaps a million Iraqis and many others lost their lives.With the assistance of a friend, she leaked a copy of Frank Koza's memo to the British newspaper, The Observer, in order to try to stop the Iraq war before it began. Sadly it was to little, too late.This important film tells the story of these events; it also details the fallout at The Observer for the article written by Martin Bright that included the sensitively classified data, and the dire circumstances Kathryn found herself in when she identified herself as the leaker and was arrested and charged with violating the Official Secrets Act. After having to wait months to find out whether or not she would be charged, and enduring attempts to deport her husband, Kathryn plead not guilty.On the day of the court hearing, Kathryn Gun said, ""I'm just baffled in the 21st century we as human beings are still dropping bombs on each other as a means to resolve issues.""I recommend watching this film to see what happened. Underhanded governmental spin, lies, espionage, and coersion are at the root of many acts of military aggression around the world.

That said, there never was any doubt in my mind from the very beginning that GW Bush et al were intent on waging an illegal war with Iraq, the results of which will be a blight on America for all eternity.The crux of the argument in this film and ultimate legal decision is a call to all decent people who may come to have knowledge of larger crimes than they themselves might commit in drawing attention to them. The film, very soberly, but with the requisite tension, maps out the linear chain of events in a British security breach that still failed to stop GW Bush's illegal war.Knightly's portrayal, sans makeup, of the real life hero is as believable as any I've ever seen of a real person thrust into such a high pressure, high profile situation.",Official Secrets
73,PaxtonMalloy,A story that needed to be told,8,11 May 2020,"Most of the movies we get to see in the bigger movie theaters and streaming services are produced to attract the biggest audience possible.

Now usually I prefer that to tell stories like that you choose a documentary because they have more credibility. But not everybody watches these and so I am glad that there are movies like this who bring it to the attention to people who without it would never know this happened.Official Secrets tells a story that it is so gripping that you basically need no screenwriter. Let's talk about the actors. Keira Knightly is an odd choice for the lead. I consider her a good actress but I don't necessarily see her as this tough woman fighting for her believes. Of course as an actress she can convince me otherwise but she didn't. She is not bad in any way. I believe anything she does on the human side when it comes to her conscience, her fear and her boyfriend. What I don't believe is her as a government spy or as the tough woman standing up to authorities.
I think this movie profits from a great supporting cast. Ralph Phinnes, Conleth Hill, Matthew Goode and Rhys Ifans even though his character and acting feels way to over the top for this movie it is still entertaining.I could have lived with a little less cliched depiction of the intelligence services and also I feel like this story didn't dramatizing with they way it is shot and lit but these are just minor issues.

The morality angle is very evenly addressed and the politics of the invasion of Iraq are laid bare. We all know now how the government of Tony Blair were sucked in to a war that had resolved very little (and may have made things worse) but to be in the know at the time and to stand up and be counted took great personal courage. And this conflict of interests is very well handled to its satisfactory resolution.I must confess that Keira Knightley is not an actress I've ever warmed to but she does a decent job in the lead role. However the standout supporting actor to me is Matt Smith who's energy and dynamism as the journalist who doggedly pursues the story he is tipped off about really keeps the film ticking along.Definitely worth a watch and hopefully it may make you question the honesty of governments in the future.",Official Secrets

Here he gets involved in something rather more international, and as the accusations against Mrs Gun for revealing secrets under the Official Secrets Act were eventually dropped, I wonder at the wisdom in making a film like this, where HM Government realized that a prime minister had himself lied to the nation. But this is by the way - as a film this works quite well, and it is an honest look at a brave woman who faced dire consequences should the charges against her stuck.

83,helenbassett,Official Secrets Film Review - Gavin Hood Directs Keira Knightley Blowing The Bloody Doors Off Tony Blair's Iraq War,10,16 November 2019,"Imagine a normal day at the GCHQ office and you get an email asking you, and your colleagues, to listen in on certain UN diplomats, the technical word I believe is spy. The US may then be able to subsequently lean on their support, after the bugging, for their upcoming Iraq War. Director Gavin Hood of Eye In The Sky takes an ear to the ground at the UK listening service in Official Secrets. Although history shows us that Bush didn't need the help of Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan, as Tony Blair all too willingly threw his political legacy under a bus when he took the UK to war.It was in 2003 that idealistic young translator Katherine Gun was watching the news that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and could use them against the west. The fantastic Keira Knightley dials down the glamour as Katherine and her moral issues about the Iraq War.Having decided to pass a copy of the email to a friend, the memo in its entirety is eventually published in The Observer, after much soul searching by the journalists. So persuasive was the pro-war propaganda. Matt Smith plays journalist Martin Bright who believes the memo is true, and Rhys Ifans is the New York based correspondent Ed Vulliamy, who dives down to actually prove it. But the US plays hardball until Ed finally gets a smoking gun, and editor Roger Alton gives it the go ahead.'Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war' is dynamite, but the new girl on the Foreign desk Nicole Mowbray, being very thorough, changed the American spellings to English and as soon as the proverbial crap hits the fan, and the memo was thought to be a fake. A shocking moment in the film that has built up such a head of steam. We are left deflated as Gavin Hood crafted this important story and with the actors impressive in their roles and now it looks in danger is being killed off. Today the US president might even call it Fake News. Martin Bright's interviews are cancelled and the only one who can prove The Observer story is true, is the whistleblower herself.No one yet knows who Katherine is. But GCHQ are determined to find out. Staying tight-lipped about her role in the leak, Katherine hangs out until GCHQ finally thinks they have their mole. At which point she holds her hands up, unwilling to see someone else take the blame. She confesses and is immediately arrested, but not charged. Her duty solicitor giving her the details of someone who might help her when she is released the next day.And then nothing happens. We imagine the Tony Blair government must have been frantically scrabbling in the background, tailing Katherine and playing dirty tricks. Eventually she is arrested and charged under The Official Secrets Act. And here we see the nonsense of her being unable to talk about her role at GCHQ to a lawyer who may then defend her. Eventually given leave for representation, she contacts the solicitors suggested to her. Liberty is not an all singing all dancing City solicitors, but they do have Ralph Fiennes as Human Right's Lawyers Ben Emmerson and Indira Varma as Shami Chakrabarti. Interesting that Ben is friends and neighbours with the DPP. Jeremy Northam's Ken MacDonald discusses the public prosecution case, obliquely of course.And amazingly it will all decide on Peter Golding, then Attorney General, and what legal advice he gave to Tony Blair and the Cabinet as to the legality of the Iraq war. The document is the evidence that Ben and Liberty need. And Katherine in the dock will have to plead Guilty or Not Guilty. We know she leaked the memo. And the case is far enough in the past not to know the shocking outcome. There's no missile strike action in Official Secrets and no suicide bombing, but it still blows the bloody doors off. And daily we can watch the news from the Middle-East and how we destabilised it with our desperate need for regime change. This is Spycatcher not 007.With the current government we can only imagine what has been going on in the shady background of today's political intrigue, and look forward to the shabby events being exposed in the future. One can only imagine how uncomfortable Official Secrets made our previous Labour government feel. I imagine the Putin Papers will be just as revealing for the Tories.",Official Secrets

I do not gather intelligence so the government can lie to the British people"" we can appreciate her higher personal standard and bravery.When the government withdrew charges (to avoid propelling the Government into criminality over the illegality of the war itself) the judge asked the prosecutor ""Care to share?""

86,gluonpaul,A decent movie but fails to bring as much drama as it should to be really interesting,6,18 October 2019,"So this is obviously based on true events but whenever a movie says that they invariably have a bias and sometimes are very far from the real events. This movie for instance portrays all journalists as very erudite and ethical and if the last few years craziness has taught us anything we can state that is clearly and unequivocally false! As such the rest of the review is purely in terms of the movie as entertainment rather than as any kind of testimonial to the real events.The acting in the movie was generally pretty decent, Matt Smith pulls off a good performance and I really enjoyed Ralph Fiennes in this movie. He managed to put a lot of character and entertainment into his role. I was a bit unimpressed with Keira Knightly in this though, for the most part she just looked tired and bored which certainly didnt add to the drama of the movie as you never got any impression of urgency from her.Speaking of which that is I think the main failing in this movie. While it has its moments trying to bring some drama to the screen for the most part it falls a bit flat.Overall its not a bad movie, and it (obviously) has an anti-war message which is admirable but it is at best a rather forgettable example of the genre. I dont think you will be overly disappointed as long as you dont go in with high expectations but at the same time I doubt the movie will make enough of an impression to be memorable in the long term.",Official Secrets

All of the cast members seem to have been asked to downplay their own role or its significance and that makes the film even more compelling because less hollywoodish. The film doesn't portray Katherin Gun as a heroine, but rather as a scared woman that feels compelled to do what's morally right, regardless of the personal ordeal she has to face due to her indiscretion.We are now into the seventeenth year of the Iraqi war, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children, and almost 5000 soldiers from the coalition of the willing have died, and after watching this film you still wonder how Blair, Bush, Cheney, Lord Goldmsmith and all the other politicians that promoted this illegal war are still allowed to walk freely and have never been indicted for anythying. Instead they are invited on talk shows. Shameful.This film clearly shows that Western democracies are at times no better than the governments of the oppressed countries they claim to set free. The only difference is that Western democracies allow for a movie industry and a freedom of press that expose these atrocities committed in the name of goo.",Official Secrets
89,anil-kulkarni-108-85663,Topical secrets,5,3 April 2020,"A typical movie about the disaster that Blair's Britain walked into eyes wide open. Focuses on a lowly betrayed beauracrat with a conscience and the aftermath of an impulsive but momentous decision. My gripe is with the main character, the motivation doesn't have enough of a background to convince. Knightly is earnest enough and the script doesn't have any flab so the minutes tick by quick and easy.",Official Secrets
90,Denno1972,Katherine Gunn is a hero,8,8 June 2021,"Like a lot of true stories, where truth is stranger than fiction the real life happening here is almost unbelievable, or at least I wish it was. At a time when the people are going along with government wishes without a question, claiming governments don't lie this film is very timely as it goes to show just why governments can't, on fact, shouldn't be trusted. The actual film here is decent but not great. It actually lacks drama when it needs it (the picking up of Katherine's husband)and tries to add drama when it doesn't need it (the two lorries overtaking is a farce). The acting is OK; I'm not a knightly basher bit I think she was just about passable here but Fiennes naturally adds a bit of class to perk things up. So the film might be average but the story is an absolute humdinger one that no Hollywood script writer could get close to.",Official Secrets

go to war against Iraq without any evidence to back up their claim that S. Hussein had those weapons of mass destruction. A great deal of good writing, acting and directorial skills have turned this ""Sixty Minutes"" sort of material into a very compelling and exciting thriller.

93,babybuletgani,recalling Meryl Streep in Silkwood,6,22 October 2019,"The publication of said email on the front page of the Observer not only brought the dirty tricks used to engineer support for Iraq #2 to the world's attention, it also led to Gun being charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act and facing an Old Bailey trial. What it didn't do, alas, was stop a war, a tragic reality that looms over Official Secrets and its attempts to make Gun a fearless free-speech champion. Rendering Gun's actions in simplistic black and white, director Gavin Hood's reductive film is a distinctly televisual recreation, lent more stature than it deserves by its A-list cast. Keira Knightley capably conveys moral certitude, recalling Meryl Streep in Silkwood. There's fine work too from Matt Smith as reporter Martin Bright and Ralph Fiennes as Liberty lawyer Ben Emmerson, though Rhys Ifans borders on caricature as a profanityspewing war correspondent.
The scenes in which Gun is interrogated have a claustrophobic charge, while her fight to stop husband Yasar (Adam Bakri) being extradited raises the tempo. Too often, however, Hood labours to fabricate tension. Meanwhile, Smith is lumbered with an excruciating speech in which he passionately reassures Gun, ""What you did matters!"" Secrets leaves us doubtful that really was the case",Official Secrets

The idea of someone risking their career by revealing a state secret and then owning up to it seemed so Brad and Janet that it did not make sense. Even though that was what happened. However Knightly convinced the audience by dint of an excellent performance that a sane person could hold such views and take such actions.The script was kept tight and neatly shortened events whilst maintaining continuity. The atmosphere was kept light by Rhys Ifans Washington Guardian reporter impersonating various American accents. A good supporting cast felt faithful to the Britishness of the story.The only, minor, niggle was the courtroom scene where the judge kept questioning the prosecution withdrawing the case. That just would not happen. The minute the case was withdrawn, that is it over. There can be no further conversation other than to release the prisoner.

It has monumental relevance to Britain today, the world as a whole and the abating debate concerning surveillance. I have never seen a more captivating motion picture. It is dramatic, it is thrilling, it is exciting, it is provoking, and it is simply spectularly splendid, in its depiction of the humble beginnings of unrest in the Middle East, and how that affected citizens of such a small country, with such large a voice. This is film chockful of nuance and signficance. It is truly brilliant to see stars like Ralph Fiennes, Rhys Ifans, Keira Knightley and Matt Smith extrapolate on the fact that even in Britain, there are checks and balances.

103,Bangorboy,An important story ruined by wooden acting and amateurish production,5,7 March 2020,I wanted to enjoy this but it was filmed like a poor bbc drama which is a real shame. If you were a conspiracy theorist you might think the powers that be might have deliberately wanted a story of this importance to be made irrelevant through bad production.I nearly gave it up after about 30mins but I'd paid for it so kept on. The acting is pretty poor throughout apart from Ralph Fiennes who tries his best to drag the film out of amateurzone. Much of the film is like watching a poor daytime tv soap. Even some of the sets are decorated and lit like a high school play.I say all this without any satisfaction. If I was one of the real people involved I'd be embarrassed to be represented like this. Behind the film lies an important story (though I hope the main protagonists weren't so completely naive as presented in the film).I gave this a 5 out of 10 but really if I hadn't paid to see it I wouldnt even have watched it to the end.,Official Secrets

130,dloft59,"Solid, even vital story, coolly related",7,31 July 2019,"In the winter of 2003, a translator working for the British government saw a document that indicated the U.S. was trying to lead the Western powers into an illegal war in Iraq. The document, an email from a US National Security Agency official, urged spying on members of the UN Security Council to pressure them to vote for a resolution to support the war. Enraged that the British government is apparently participating in this effort to lie to their respective nations' citizens and blackmail others to justify an illegal war, Katharine Gun arranges for the email to be leaked to the press.Co-writer and director Gavin Wood, whose last project was the taut and thrilling ""Eye in the Sky,"" has created a more calm and conventional presentation of a true story here. It's important -- and even relevant in 2019, when the U.S. President constantly lies and casually dismisses evidence of international espionage. It's also beautifully shot, underplayed with superb acting (especially by Knightley, who manages to hold together somewhat disparate plots -- her character's personal arc with her Turkish Muslim immigrant husband, the issues for the media faced with this info, and the legal questions raised by her defense team), with a brooding, mostly not in-your-face score.But it's a talky movie that may find it a challenge to connect with American audiences: no shooting, no car chases or punches thrown, and only a brief war-zone scene. The viewer is left to take the critical issues from recent history as far as he or she chooses, and some of the more thorny questions about political whistle-blowers such as Assange and Snowden remain untouched. (The motives of the real Katharine Gun may indeed have been as pure as they're depicted here, and if so, major kudos to her, but that doesn't make for a terribly ambiguous protagonist and story). The understated plotting and acting lead to an equally -- and probably also true -- understated and almost anti-climactic denouement in court, where Gun appears to face charges of violating Britain's Official Secrets Act.I'm glad Wood and company made the movie. The story and the questions it raises are worth thinking about . . . and one cannot help wondering how Tony Blair, George W. Bush, and Colin Powell look upon those events -- and how they're depicted in this movie -- today.",Official Secrets

But even here, the Director and Kiera Knightly play the role in a very low key way.

136,giallopudding,"Good production values, story is poppycock",5,21 November 2019,"The story (spoilers): Brit intelligence employee Katharine Gun leaked a memo. Being a leftist, she made leftist assumptions about the motives behind the memo. The leftist newspapers to which she leaked said memo made leftist assumptions about the meaning of the memo. Doo doo hits the fan.Much as with the idiotic quid pro quo inquisition against U.S. President Trump, there was NO mention of intent by U.S. intelligence to blackmail UN Security Council members. U.S. intelligence wanted British intelligence to help them SPY on the UN Security Council, yes. But that's all that was asked in the memo. Gun and her activist pals simply did not want Britain to be involved in the war in Iraq, and saw this as a way to sabotage that prospect.I agree that the war in Iraq was unnecessary and immoral. I never supported it from day one. That is a different issue.If any lesson can be learned from a film like Official Secrets, it is that people on both sides of the fence will invent motives for what others do and say, and will outright lie to the public to sway opinion. It is reprehensible to me, no matter the motive.This type of reality fabrication has resulted in making the mainstream press essentially untrustworthy, and a joke. Fake news brought this upon themselves, by publishing stories such as that around which Official Secrets is based.I was hoping this film would have more meat to it...some real intel that incriminated the U.S. intel agencies in their machinations to whip up a war against Iraq that ended with hundreds of thousands dead and wounded.No such luck.",Official Secrets

As most of the plot is a matter of public knowledge, it doesn't make sense to avoid spoilers.This is a dramatic retelling of the story of Katharine Gun, the GCHQ operative who leaked the request by the US to spy on the delegates of the UN Security Council in the run up to voting on permitting war on Iraq. It should be a biography but in a story this complex, a lot of shortcuts and imagined meetings must have happened.There were lots of excerpts from media footage of Bush and Blair. To take you back into the turn of the millenium. I thought this was a slickly told story, well edited but also sadly flawed. I had many questions frustratingly unanswered. The film itself determined really to look at the legitimacy of the war v the need to disclose state secrets. In essence, the means for the latter attempting to defeat the ends of the former.The strength of the film is in several areas. What is does exceptionally well is explain very complex situations succinctly. The conflict in disclosing top secret information was set out as the duty to the government v the duty to the country in the police interrogation. The Iraq war as the sheer human cost of removing a tyrants regime as Katharine and her husband argued.Even the legal argument was easy to grasp as it was layered slowly from a passing thought to the defence which led to charges being dropped. Ralph Fiennes stole every scene with understated precision in his barrister role.The flaw is that the film couldn't quite work out if it was a drama in the newsroom, the courtroom, the bedroom or the police interview room. It was all too neatly self contained stopping each bit from resolving.It can't have been this neatly divisible in realtiy. I struggled to understand why the film didn't bother for example to reflect on GCHQs water cooler moment as the charges were dropped in court. Instead, the film abruptly stopped at the moment a relieved Katharine said she would do it again, betraying secrets.And here is the issue with this. Keira Knightly was cast as the lead. But what stole the show was her makeup artist. As the tension started to wear on her, Keira looked visibly worn emotionally. But in general there was a lot of stoney faces from the police (special branch?), to work colleagues, to Ralph fiennes as lawyer. And this was despite there being a lot of conflict. The conflicts were contained largely between Katherine and her husband.The actual flashpoint was between Ken McDonald and Ralph Fiennes Ben Emmerson QC somewhere on the coast away from London. And even then the film left unexplained why there was such a vicious underlying antagonism between the two. It did this a lot. Some kind of shadowy internal affairs at GCHQ applying pressure on colleagues was really the last straw for Katherine? There had to be more but it was all left unsaid.The newsroom bits were probably the best bits. The over the top acting as everyone was losing their head in the Observer. The Washington correspondent was hammy but entertaining. Yvonne Ridley meeting the journalist to handover the leak was a well done moment building up tension. a lot of material was drawn uponThe most profound bit was the discussion around censorship on national security grounds. The film explored a lot but here is the flaw, it just concluded the newsroom story around two thirds of the way in. The story then made way for the final act in the courtroom. Where again, it just got stuffy if not farcical as ""the best lawyer"" the DPP had opted not to prosecute at trial. Why even go to trial? The plot itself was that it would have meant disclosing that the legal advice at the time was that the UK going to war in Iraq was illegal. Was it?It just made a well produced film unsatisfying. A lot of thought had gone into very subtly told scenes. For example, even the lighting in gchq offices and the police rooms seemed oppressive. The dress sense of the detectives was twee as if they knew they didn't belong to the world of spooks. And that's the problem with the story, it just jars as if it's out of place somehow.",Official Secrets

It seems pointless regurgitating the plot because it is factual and well-known and, despite any real surprises, the director keeps the tension going. It just shows you can craft thoroughly enjoyable films taking the high moral ground without the ridiculous violence and coy sexuality of most Hollywood offerings. The core of the film is the ethical question of whether state employees act for the people or the government and the latter's privileged cronies and backers. Catherine Gun calls this into question and, despite the UK Government rephrasing the Official Secrets Act, she triumphs because of the duplicity of the then UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and the obvious willingness of the USA to prosecute a patently illegal war with Iraq whatever the United Nations votes or does.

I found it compelling viewing, calling out (under my breath) 'you B*'s' at one stage, when witnessing downright bullying and racism from the top!Official Secrets will open your eyes to some of what goes on in the name of us, the public; showing the inconvenient truth, and how, by any means, illegal, manipulative, underhand, media puppetry, media-led and media-fed propaganda and hysteria, or otherwise, is used to push certain individual's, politician's, and political goals through, no matter the cost. I use 'is' as in the present tense, as we'd be fools to think that this kind of thing doesn't still go on today, in all levels of politics and business, domestic and worldwide.Some may say this is an anti-war film and disrespects those who went to war. Others may say that there are disloyal aspects as Katherine Gun (the irony of her surname, hasn't passed me by) breached the 'official secret act', that that's treasonous and the law is the law, isn't it? No, it's not taking away anything away from who have fought. This is more of a we, the people and those who serve, have right to know the truth and make informed decisions film, and not be lied to or manipulated by those we elect and give our trust to. If you think otherwise, enjoy your shrouded, protected world; don't open your eyes or watch the film. I wouldn't blame you in a way.This may not be the hyped up all entertaining popcorn blockbuster that you'd race to see, but I would urge everyone to see this film, who enjoys a well told, intellectual, meaningful story, and where you're interested in knowing facts rather than being kept in the dark.This is today's equivalent of the classic 'All the President's Men'.

It neither cinematically portrays politics, nor does it elevate the protagonist.This film could have either been a documentary which would have done justice to its intention, or it should have taken enough creative liberty to portray the psychological impact that comes along with standing up against the Official Secrets Act. Since the whole movie is shown through the POV of one single character - the lens is pretty narrow to fit 'behind the scenes' political drama. Having seen Snowden, I am left to say that it had lotta scope open for exploration.Barring all that - It's worth a watch, but the expectation that the trailer leaves us with is in some sense - a mirage.",Official Secrets

189,averytanman,A story not told enough,7,30 October 2020,"An atmospheric drama thriller that considers how sensitive information can travel all the way from the top to the bottom of the government body, fall into the hands of one daring employee, then find its way to the press and subsequently the public. The film is based on real-life events from 2003 when Katharine Gun (who was working as a Chinese translator for the GCHQ) leaked a top-secret US-British memo detailing espionage and blackmail operations set to influence the UN vote in favor of the invasion of Iraq. Gun, portrayed by Kiera Knightley, is relatively unimportant in the grand scheme of things until her big decision, after which she is seen as a sort of underdog. There is, however, the issue of how this dramatized perspective depicts Gun as a central hero and emphasizes her subjective narrative as a selfless co-worker and loving wife who later on even fought against her Turkish husband's deportation in a climactic airport scene, truly an emotional moment. Yet throughout the movie little attention is given towards the imminent Iraq War, the controversial subject of discussion in the fateful memo. It is not that principal conflict which is discussed here but rather one British woman's personal struggle as a byproduct of it, similar to the sort of focus placed on Edward Snowden in his respective biopic. And then the apparent closure at the end of the film once the charges are dropped against Katharine does not do history justice; a story about the inner workings of war cannot appear to close on a satisfying note when, in truth, the crisis in Iraq was far from resolved. This seemed to me a particularly self-righteous conclusion in the face of the greater battle. But overall the film does its job of raising awareness on the reality of world authorities; the power they have to move under the radar, and the strings they pull to evade their own laws. Among the number of government operations in history meant to be kept secret, this lesser-known story recounts one of the few instances such a ploy was brought to light. Indeed there could be multiple diabolical political schemes taking place in the world right now, to which we the public are none the wiser simply because no one has the mind to blow the whistle.",Official Secrets

This is an injustice because she wears no makeup during the entire movie. The Poster with her enlarged facial features was made that way to attract people who are attracted to her look, like in the movie Pirates of Caribbean. But without makeup in the movie, this poster lies to us from the beginning. Keira Knightley is pretty. I even have a picture of her on my bedroom wall. But be honest, she's much more enjoyable to look at when she wears even just a little makeup.
So that being the case against the Poster, then I wonder what other lies are we watching? It's said to be a ""true story"". The movie actually just becomes a personal drama once her husband is set to be deported. We actually see less and less of Keira as the movie goes on, (I can't tell if that's good or bad since she's not looking to attractive). :)

I am so glad I did.Official Secrets tells the story of Katherine Gunn, the English whistle blower who went against the Official Secrets Act and released confidential information detailing that the US President George Bush, and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, lied about the legality of the Iraq war and tried to blackmail officials into signing a UN resolution.Everything about his film was amazing. Keira Knightley gave a fabulous performance. Regardless of how you feel about the real life story, you really do feel for her throughout the film. The way that her own (and my own, I would like to point out) treat her, and her family after the leak is despicable, and the fact that they basically deprive her of all her rights, cast a poor light on the justice system, and the people who are supposed to uphold it. This is such an emotionally charged and suspenseful film, and she really does play all those emotions so well. But I don't know if the message about freedom of speech and human rights really comes across as strongly as I would have liked it too, considering that is meant to be the main storyline here.The pacing is great, the tension in broken up well with tender and romantic moments. And the scenes in the newsroom at the Observer are a great change of pace. They serve a great job of showing how the effects of what is happening in the film effected people other than the main characters of the story. They also use a fair amount of actual news reel footage from the time to remind people that these events actually happened. The scenes of the anti war protests did a better job of telling the audience how people felt about the war, then anything they could have put on camera. I was really young when all this was going on in the UK, so for me seeing this footage and hearing this story was absolutely horrifying. However until the end these two stories never really intersect, so it's almost like watching two separate films. A film about the press' struggle with reporting about the war would have been equally as interesting to me as the one we got. But maybe didn't belong as a side-line in this film.There are also one or two unnecessary elements here I need to mention. The scene on the train where Katherine may or may not have been being followed by some pretty serious lookin' dudes, added no doubt to add a little thriller feeling to this otherwise biographical flick, went nowhere. It was barely touched upon again and I quite honestly forgot it had ever happened by the end of the film. And I also don't think they played enough in to the deportation storyline. If they had to put that in there, then they should at least have given us the emotional fall out of the government trying to forcibly deport her husband for no reason, Instead it was brushed under the rug. So in some places maybe this film tried to do too many things at once.Yes, this does take quite a few liberties with historical fact to make it a watchable film, but as with most films this kind, it was bound to happen, otherwise you may as well just watch newsreels. With the political landscape looking the way it does in both the US and the UK at the moment, this film is still strangely relevant today, and one I would definitely recommend watching.",Official Secrets

207,kitaygorodgeroy,Kitay's review,6,19 September 2021,"Official Secrets (2019) is based on true story of Katherine Gun, who worked on British Government and became a whistleblower.She leaked the documents to the press to prevent Britain's participation in the war in Iraq. Let's make it concrete. Katherine exposed wrongdoing and lies in the face of the American Government. The war was started with the false claim that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and they planned to use them against Western countries. Both statements were pure lies fabricated by the Bush administration, but at that time many people believed them.The main character feels that she is bound by civil ties. In this case, Katherine found the courage and was able to make up her mind to stay against the entire political system. Katherine acted in the interests of the British people, trying to protect them. After the documents were leaked to the press, the government sounded the alarm and launched an internal investigation into who did it. Katerina herself confessed to what she had done, but after 6 months of court proceedings, she was still acquitted.The film once again sharpens the issue of abridge freedom of speech. Viewer can be not in line with what Gun did. But a lot of British people were in favour of Gun's actions, because they want to know truth.In general, the film is quite stable and slow paced in its narrative. The plot, as mentioned earlier, is based on real events, so there are no intriguing twists in it. The acting game well conveys the annoying tension that the main characters had. But this tension subsides when the exculpatory words are pronounced in the last scene and the film ends.",Official Secrets
208,billybounce-98306,Let's help the director to choose a genre,5,20 September 2021,"What can I say about the movie Official secrets? The actors did a wonderful job with their roles. Amazing Ralph Fiennes, wonderful Keira Knightley. A great story that lies at the heart of the plot. Everything was shot perfectly. It would seem that I am writing a good review of the film, but this is where the advantages of the film ends.So now let's move on to the plot. The moment of the heroine's torment about the war and whether to admit that she is a whistleblower takes very little screen time. I didn't even have time to get into her feelings and the torment of her conscience. ""Richard Jewell"" is a great example of how to convey this moment. I understand that she was being in the spotlight for less time in the real life, but we should understand that it is not a documentary, so the director could stretch this moment and concentrate on it in order to show what it was like to make the choice that she made. In the case of the film, I could describe the whole plot in a couple of theses: she doesn't like what the government is doing, she wants to publish a letter from management, she does it, then she doesn't know whether to admit it to management, then she still confesses, then she chills with her husband, but they take him away, but it takes 2 minutes of screen time, she rests again, and then she wins the trial. I realize that it is very difficult to make such a choice that she made, but I realize this because I try it on myself, the film tells me almost nothing about it. Although Ralph Fiennes is very good, his character is revealed as little as possible.As a result, we get neither a detective story nor a drama, but only an attempt to make a move with these genres.I am disappointed: 5 mental sufferings out of 10.",Official Secrets
209,pevseev-48638,Government lies to us,10,20 September 2021,"The film told us true-based a story about not widely-known whistleblower Katrina Gun, who revealed a truth about reasons of beginning war in Iraq. During her work for Britain's Government Communication Headquarters she found, that government tried to blackmail some members of UN in aim to coerce them endorse invasion of Iraq. We can see her hesitations about that she should prioritise law over morality or morality over law . Her own attitude to all wars was extremely negative. In addition to that husband of Gun is muslim. That is the reason induce her to leak the letters. Katrina decided not to be onlooker of dirty story and send information to friends in anti-war community. This film leads us to question of our own decision in such situation. I have no idea about my own behaviour, because it is really hard for person to go through a trial and wave of hatred. I want emphasised that we spare Katrina over government, because she behaves more rightly with our own imaginations of utility for society. The idea, that sometimes break law is morally permissible came spring from this film because of its interesting narration and admirable acting. Especially, I want to highlight Keira Knightley works. It's possible her best drama performance.",Official Secrets
210,NES_reviewgroup4,Exceptional picture,8,7 October 2021,"Great story, highlighting concerns of great importance for every human being and the main cast consisting of Kiera Knightley, Ralph Fiennes and Matt Smith, demonstrating first-class acting performance guarantee that you would not waste your time watching the ""Official Secrets"" by Gavin Hood.The movie is based on the real case of Katharine Gun (Kiera Knightley), whistleblower who leaked a memo to reporters exposing criminal activities of US and UK Intelligence officials, specifically, act of blackmailing UN diplomats into supporting Iraq Invasion Resolution in 2003. The story is built around this act, describing causes and consequences of Gun's decision not only for herself but for British society as a whole.The topic of whistleblowing is quite controversial. Is it right thing to do or not? As for my concern, this work does not truly answer this question. To analyze any topic, both sides of the coin should be considered, however, audience see the picture only from the whistleblower's point of view.I believe the ""Official Secrets"" is not about if Gunn's action was wrongdoing, it is about humanness, solidarity, extraordinary courage, devotion to the principles and ideals regardless of the consequences. Throughout the story, main characters appear to us as exceptional models, who, despite being arm-twisted, fight unscrupulous government officials, putting universal human values before their own desires, comfort and even lives.In our era of action, there are not many films that makes you reflect about such important issues, even less pictures that do it in a proper way. ""Official Secrets"" is one of the few. It had lasting impact on me and, notwithstanding the critics of being flat, I would highly recommend this work to watching.",Official Secrets
211,kgubernatorov,NES,4,6 October 2021,"This story took place in 2003 in the wake of the anti-terrorism campaign launched by the U. S. authorities after 9/11 and in which they dragged the entire Western world. Katharine Gun, fluent in Mandarin, was employed as a translator at GCHQ in Cheltenham, one of the departments of British intelligence, she learns of a conspiracy between the U. S. and British governments to illegally invade Iraq. The agency tapped the phones and read the emails of six UN delegates - from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea and Pakistan. Countries that might have influenced the decision to invade Iraq. She realizes that she cannot confront the government alone and passes the information to the mass media. On the one hand, making it public can help save thousands of innocent lives. On the other hand, Katharine signed a non-disclosure of official secrets and should justifiably be punished for it.After the publication, her quiet and peaceful life turns into a nightmare, as the official authorities began threatening and arm-twisting. It should be pointed out that Katharine's partner-Yasar Gun-is a refugee (Kurd) and the British authorities see him as a weak point of Katharine's and try to deport him, but she manages to parry the blow by presenting a document proving the legitimacy of their relationship.Her lawyers, Ben Emmerson and Shami Chakrabarti from ""Liberty,"" built a good defense strategy in such a way that eventually the government backed down and dropped all the charges against her.The film clearly shows us the manipulation of society by the state under the guise of ""justice and lawfulness"" of their actions but in fact they circumvent the law. It doesn't always have a ""happy ending"" like in this movie, because after Katharine there were many more whistleblowers like Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, such people became outcasts or ended up in prison. In my mind, this film is outdated in terms of perception and portrayal of those who act as whistleblowers. Nowadays whistleblowers act as an association of independent journalists; it is usually a legal entity registered in a country with an English-based law system and it allows people who make the secrets public to avoid political and criminal prosecutions.",Official Secrets
212,nes_rev_3_21_sbb,The film is flat. It does not leave the question whether it was right to do so?,6,6 October 2021,"Natalie Portman plays whistleblower, who risked a lot for the idea of saving many lives. She disclosed a memo from NSA to her British intelligence office to help arm-twist holdout countries to recognize the war as legal.The atmosphere of the movie perfectly conveys the state of Katharine Gun (real name of the whistleblower). The scenery really takes us back to the time of 2003. However, the story looks flat. There are few moments that remembered, and they are not the key in the story, for instance, the situation about the difference between British and American English.While watching we understand that she is a hero, she sounded the alarm despite non-disclosure agreement. The film puts emphasis on her desire and her principles, everybody around her admire her act: her lawyers, her husband, her colleagues. Notwithstanding I believe that the fact that she prioritizes the security of the country over her life, is something irrational. The stakes for her were too high, she primarily stirred up trouble, that could have a lasting impact on herself and her husband. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that, by and large, her act did not stop the invasion, she put everything on the line and lost. The only thing that happened was the biggest demonstration in the history of the UK with overcrowded streets. It should not be thought that I do not support her principles and her act, I also believe that she is a law-abider, but I am sure that, first of all, people should think about themselves.To sum up, ""Official secrets"" boils down to telling us the story how Katharine Gun leaked a memo to save lives and how she trumped the law. And it does not leave a chance for the viewer to think about whether what Catherine did is right, the movie only presents her as a hero.",Official Secrets
213,chirathc4,Pretty Good but !,7,24 March 2020,"This is my first time writing a review because the movie has a large plot hole. *** SPOLER ALERT ***She ( Katharine) wanted to prevent US from fixing a vote.The second, the memo was leaked to the public, her task is done. It doesnt matter if US deny it
The voters at UN would know something fishy is going on. Hence it would be harder for US to fix it. She succeededBut still she was worried the US would get away by deniying
Worst yet she decided to turn in. Really?She was shocked that the paper would print the whole memo.Havent she thought about that possibility?And she didnt know the content of Official secrets Act that she signed when she took the job at GCHQ.
