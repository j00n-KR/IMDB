0,MartinHafer,Wow...talk about a generation gap....,9,6 May 2011,"""Animal House"" is a comedy classic and there have already been a bunch of reviews for it. So, instead of discussing the specifics, I want to relate what happened when I re-watch the film a few years ago. Now I have always loved ""Animal House"" and the film never fails to make me laugh. Even now, if my wife says 'Fawn Liebowitz', I can't help but laugh. So, when my oldest daughter got old enough to watch the film (which is 30, but I watched it with her when she turned 18), we watched it together. I KNEW she'd laugh hysterically....and she never did. In fact, when the film was over, she said 'it's okay...' and I was shocked. How could she not love the film?! Well, I think a lot of it happens to have a lot to do with when you grew up. Back in the late 70s, it worked GREAT but now here in 2008, it fell a bit flat. Wow...what a shock.So, I assume that the film will definitely work better if you grew up around the time the film was made...though it is possible that my oldest is just a weird!",National Lampoon's Animal House
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Vulgar, but also incredibly funny with a truly wonderful performance from Belushi",8,25 September 2010,"Animal House is not my favourite comedy or anything, but I like it very much. I do like comedy, I like John Landis and I like John Belushi, so naturally I thought yeah I think I'll like this film. And I did. While light on plot and quite vulgar strictly speaking, it is still hugely enjoyable thanks to the performances. Animal House is beautifully filmed, has a good soundtrack and John Landis does a great job directing, while the sight gags are smart and the script has enough hilarious one-liners to keep you chuckling. As for favourite scenes, I have two specific favourites, the food fight and the wonderful rallying speech. The acting is very good, while Kevin Bacon, Tom Hulce, Peter Reigert and Donald Sutherland give great performances, it is John Belushi's film all the way as he gives one of his best ever performances in this film. In conclusion, very good film and funny. 8/10 Bethany Cox",National Lampoon's Animal House
2,Leofwine_draca,Lively and likeable,7,14 August 2018,"NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE is a lively and likeable frat house comedy which may well be the best of its type; it's certainly the most entertaining I've seen, with John Landis' clever direction adding immeasurably to the fun of the proceedings. This is certainly a more enjoyable production than something like AMERICAN GRAFFITI, that's for sure; the kind of film to blow the cobwebs away. The film offers an ensemble cast of performers, all of whom put in energetic turns, none more so than John Belushi whose towering performance dominates the proceedings. Elsewhere, there's a mix of fresh talent (Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Kevin Bacon) and more seasoned actors in support (the ever-dependable John Vernon and Donald Sutherland, for instance). The film is, like other NATIONAL LAMPOON features, essentially a series of sketches and set-pieces, but they feel fresh and funny, and there's never a dull moment.",National Lampoon's Animal House
3,SnoopyStyle,the original house,8,21 June 2015,"It's 1962 Faber College. Roommates Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) apply for Omega House but it's soon obvious that they are being rejected. They find the hard partying Delta Tau Chi House and wild man John 'Bluto' Blutarsky (John Belushi) where Dorfman is a legacy. The house is led by Otter (Tim Matheson) and Boon (Peter Riegert). Boon's girlfriend Katy (Karen Allen) is serving beers. They are supported by pot-smoking English professor Jennings (Donald Sutherland). Dean Wormer aims to shut down Delta. Neidermeyer is rush chair for Omega and ROTC cadet officer.This doesn't seem like anything special nowadays and it does things that are common place today. However it was ground breaking for its time with its tasteless low-brow humor. It's also not filled with comedians as one may expect. Of course, there is the great John Belushi and that's enough for most movies. There are also memorable characters like Flounder and Neidermeyer. It's uneven and a bit messy. The leads are scattered through several characters. The female characters are underdeveloped and Mary Louise Weller has trouble keeping a straight face. Nevertheless, this is a great theatrical debut for National Lampoon and is a comedic landmark.",National Lampoon's Animal House
4,Prismark10,Frat Pack,7,14 July 2014,"There was American Graffiti a few years earlier but Animal House set a standard of frat pack comedies with tits and ass that we still see today with the American Pie films.The film is set in the early 1960s as the college Dean Vernon Wormer wants to remove the Deltas from the campus due to repeated conduct violations and low academic achievement. Of course the Deltas will include almost anyone in their house and is a haven for misfits in contrast to the Omegas who are clean cut, smug, privileged as well as exclusive who will have nothing to do with people who are fat, ugly, poor or coloured.The screenplay and comedy was fresh for the time and the characters played by Tim Matheson, Peter Riegert, Tom Hulce have been imitated by others since then. In fact Tom Hanks very much copied Matheson's character in the 1980s.Used sparingly John Belushi gives the loudest and wildest performance as Bluto and it all ends up in chaos in a parade where the Deltas have a rogue float that causes havoc.Animal House has a messy, manic energy which its cast runs with as they know at least which direction they are heading. They blazed a trail for what followed but this film got there first.",National Lampoon's Animal House
5,mark.waltz,The turbulent 60's as seen through the eyes of the turbulent 70's.,7,1 January 2021,"While there's certainly had been slob comedies long before this National Lampoon movie was made, this was the first to Garner national attention and become a box office smash. it was also the first R-rated movie I got to see without adult accompaniment in the theater so seeing it again more than 43 years later gives this film for me a sense of nostalgia.Delta House at Faber College has the reputation for the worst grades, the dirtiest dorms and the most rowdy parties so Dean Wormer (John Vernon) put them on double secret probation. New pledges Tom Hulce and Stephen Furst are rejected from the uppity
Omega Theta Pi fraternity, and this sets up several opportunities for revenge from Delta to Omega thanks to some of the veteran Delta pledges led by John Belushi and Peter Riegert after the nasty Mark Metcalf humiliates the heavyset Furst.There are so many memorable moments in this slob comedy too innumerable to list, but the highlights are Hulce's dealing with an underage girl at a Toga party (which results in a very funny battle of conscience), another Delta member's seduction of the encouragible dean's wife (Verna Bloom), the events leading up to a food fight, the twists concerning Metcalf's horse and of course the final parade sequence.This insured film stardom for the outrageous Belushi, straight out of ""Saturday Night Live"", showing how mashed potatoes can be used for much more and how a hopping ladder can become a tool for ecstasy. Karen Allen, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Cesare Danova have other major parts with Sutherland definitely representing the later 1960's counter culture even though his character is a product of the 1950's.There's even a bit of social commentary with the presence of a black soul group at the toga party and the follow-up encounter at a black nightclub that the Delta members venture into accidentally. Vernon is perfect as the typical pompous older man with power whose stuffy personality is colored with some delightfully crude viatrobes. There's so much more to this than just togas and drunk frat brothers and food fights. It's a metaphor for the downswing of the traumas of the 70's commenting on similar moods and trials of the decade before that had only begun to build in tensions.",National Lampoon's Animal House
6,classicsoncall,"""Seven years of college down the drain!""",7,26 July 2018,"If it means anything, my viewing of ""Animal House"" was of the 'Double Secret Probation Edition', but that sounded more like a slick blurb on the DVD cover than anything else. Well, watching this film for the very first time since it came out, which was forty years ago as I write this, I'm somewhat at a loss as to how to explain it's immense popularity. There's John Belushi's presence of course, he was pretty much at the top of his game in the late Seventies. But any time he's not on screen, the picture simply rambles along with an aimless plot involving Dean Wormer's (John Vernon) attempt to get Delta Tau Chi booted off the campus of Faber College. The whole college/frat house scene seemed a bit anachronistic as depicted for 1962, but then again, I never pledged so maybe I'm missing something. It seems to me the funniest parts of the movie were the ones shown as trailers for the picture back in the day. I particularly recall Belushi's challenge to a 'FOOD FIGHT', but unless I missed something, that food fight scene lasted about as long as it took Bluto Blutarsky (Belushi) to announce it. There was that 'zit' scene too, but that had more to do with gross-out factor than humor.Probably the best parts of the picture for me were those times Otis Day and the Knights hit the screen, especially with their rousing version of 'Shout'. But even then, there was a bit of movie sleight of hand going on, as actor Dewayne Jessie led a fictional band in performing that song, along with Shama Lama Ding Dong. And to top it all off, Jessie was lip synching along to the voice of singer Lloyd Williams. I guess I'll have to stick with the Isley Brothers. Anyway, I'm not here to bash the film because I know it has it's fans, and that's all well and good. But it seems to have had it's day in the sun, and if I were to offer some guidance on viewing the picture today, I'd go with the sage wisdom offered to Flounder by Bluto - ""My advice to you is to start drinking heavily"".",National Lampoon's Animal House
7,gavin6942,Widely Considered the Greatest Comedy,7,25 March 2010,"The Delta House at Faber College is on probation, and move to double secret probation. Dean Vernon Wormer is out to get them... but they aren't willing to disappear without having a little fun.This film has been voted as the greatest comedy of all time by many distinguished people. I don't know. It was good, sure, but didn't really make me laugh and i have little desire to see it again. I can't say it was bad, but it wasn't like the greatest, either.John Belushi is funny, but was funniest at his most quiet. The ""zit"" joke isn't funny, but piling food on his tray was. D-Day was cool, but Flounder and Pinto were pretty lame for being the main characters... it was really only Otter that saved this film. He should have had an even bigger role.I am glad I have finally seen this film... it took me almost thirty years to get around to it. Now it's one more I can check off the list.",National Lampoon's Animal House
8,lee_eisenberg,what a wonderful world it is with John Belushi being a P-I-G,10,25 June 2005,"Everybody knows the story of Faber College's wild Delta fraternity making their own rules while the law-and-order-obsessed dean tries to expel them in 1962. But you still have to see it! Whether it's John Belushi's whole skit in the cafeteria, the toga party, or the grand finale, ""Animal House"" is a laugh riot from beginning to end. How anyone was able to come up with something so damn hilarious shows what geniuses some people are.As for some of the characters, we'll first focus on the Deltas. Belushi's John ""Bluto"" Blutarsky is in a class all by himself, Eric ""Otter"" Stratton (Tim Matheson) is a new kind of pervert, Donald ""Boone"" Schoenstein (Peter Riegert) toes too many lines for his own good, Larry ""Pinto"" Kroger (Tom Hulce) tries but fails to play it straight, and Kent ""Flounder"" Dorfman (Stephen Furst) is a dork.Then, there's the vicious Omega house. Gregg Marmalard (James Daughton) is the creepiest of the creepy, Sgt. Douglas Niedermeyer (Mark Metcalf) represents the army's nastiest aspects, and Chip Diller (Kevin Bacon in his debut) shows that new doesn't necessarily mean good.Next, the older characters. Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) is almost a Nazi, Prof. Dave Jennings (Donald Sutherland) is a proto-hippie, Marion Wormer (Verna Bloom) seems unfulfilled in life, and Mayor Carmine DePasto (Cesare Danova) likes to extort.And then there's the women. Katy (Karen Allen) is dating Boone but is often displeased with him. But especially noticeable are Mandy Pepperidge (Mary Louise Weller) and Babs Jansen (Martha Smith). Maybe it's Babs' sweet-talking accent, or maybe it's the camera angle on Mandy when Otter is talking to her in the cafeteria, or maybe it's the scene where Bluto is looking up their dresses, or maybe it's the scene where Bluto watches Mandy undress. But whatever it is, those two babes each deserve their own chapters in the Encyclopedia of Hot Women, if there ever is one! Anyway, ""Animal House"" is beyond hilarious. Not even the grouchiest, most miserly person could resist laughing. Every time that I hear ""Wonderful World"", I think of John Belushi piling the food onto his tray. On that subject, the soundtrack rivals ""American Graffiti"" in terms of how neat it is. SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!",National Lampoon's Animal House
9,jboothmillard,National Lampoon's Animal House,8,7 September 2009,"I knew there are many spin-offs, but this is considered by the critics as the only good one, so I decided to see if for myself, from writer Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters), and director John Landis (The Blues Brothers, An American Werewolf in London). Basically, set in 1962, freshman Faber College students Larry Kroger (Amadeus's Tom Hulce) and Kent 'Flounder' Dorfman (Stephen Furst) want to join a fraternity. After visit g a few, including the snobby Omega house, they find the Delta house, where they meet womaniser Eric 'Otter' Stratton (Tim Matheson), his adventurous best friend Donald 'Boon' Schoenstein (Peter Riegert), Boon's girlfriend Katy (Starman's Karen Allen), daring thrill-seeker Daniel 'D-Day' Simpson (Bruce McGill), responsible Robert Hoover (James Widdoes), and the unforgettable John 'Bluto' Blutarsky (John Belushi). They are quickly accepted in to the fraternity and allowed to join in wild toga parties, road trips, and practical jokes. Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) is determined to get all of Delta kicked off campus, and all members expelled, with the help of Omega house, with its leaders Doug Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf) and Greg Marmalard (James Daughton), and new pledge Chip Diller (young Kevin Bacon). As the hilarious escapades continue with all Delta house causing havoc, Dean eventually expels most members for poor grades, and led by Bluto they rebel with a huge revenge at the annual Homecoming parade. Also starring Verna Bloom as Marion Wormer, Cesare Danova as Mayor Carmine DePasto, Donald Sutherland as pot smoking teacher Dave Jennings, Mary Louise Weller as Mandy Pepperidge and Sarah Holcomb as Clorette DePasto. You can tell American Pie must have been inspired by this film, with a fantastic performance by Belushi, and crammed with fantastic sight gags and one-liners, it is a very likable comedy classic. It was number 82 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Toga! Toga!""), it was number 47 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",National Lampoon's Animal House
10,ccthemovieman-1,This Picture Says It All,5,25 March 2006,"This movie should be in a time capsule. What better example to show the great progress Liberal thinking and influence had on the USA in the 1960s and 1970s? By this time, it was official: anything bad is ""ccol"" and good is really bad. Got it?This has it all: getting drunk every night is the goal; vandalizing is fun; being totally obnoxious and a slob is the only way to act and be cool; make fun of any kind of authority, especially anyone connected to the (ugh) military; make fun of anyone who is religious and party til you puke!!!This is what life is all about and who better to show this than John Belushi....the ultimate party slob (until he overdosed on drugs and killed himself but, hey, at least he wasn't a phony actor just playing a role).Animal House - ah, the benefits of higher education!",National Lampoon's Animal House
11,Tweekums,A classic that changed high school/college comedy,9,8 November 2012,"Delta Tau Chi is the worst fraternity at Faber College; their conduct is a disgrace and their academic achievements are non-existent... this is the house that Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfman join after being rejected by the prestigious Omega Theta Pi fraternity. Here they will get into a number of scrapes with their new friends. Members of the house get up to many dubious things; one climbs a ladder to watch the girls getting undressed; another seduces the dean's wife and another gets the mayor's thirteen year old daughter drunk at a toga party! These and many other events lead to the fraternity being disbanded and its members expelled... they don't get mad though; they get even!This film is rightly considered a classic; love it or loathe it there is no denying it had a major influence on comedies for years to come. While it lead to films like 'Porky's' and the 'American Pie' series this is actually quite a bit tamer as it isn't about a group of guys desperate to have sex; several of the gags may have sexual overtones but most don't; they are just the hilarious antics of a group of lazy students and their ongoing conflict with the dean and their neighbours the stuck-up Omega fraternity. If you sit down to watch it for the first time you'll probably think you've seen certain scenes already as they have become so well known through references in other films and TV shows. The jokes are almost all funny and on the rare occasions that one falls flat it doesn't matter as there will be another funny thing to laugh at moments later. Some people may find it a little offensive as here is some swearing and nudity; although the latter is limited to bare breasts and a couple of naked backsides... and don't worry thirteen year old Clorette was played by eighteen year old Sarah Holcomb! The acting might not be of the greatest but that is part of the films charm; the cast, which includes the likes of John Belushi, Donald Sutherland and Kevin Bacon in a minor role, looked like they were having fun.If you like a good laugh you owe it to yourself to watch this at least once although I suspect most people will want to watch it more than that.",National Lampoon's Animal House
12,Quinoa1984,What started it all- and still the best,10,3 June 2000,"This is the best college comedy ever made. Nothing has ever come close to comedic perfection, and never will again. The early bird director John Landis directs this film into greatness bringing stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Tom Hulce, Mark Metcalf and Donald Sutherland to the screen in brilliance. True, this film is just about a bunch of misfits defying authority in a campus of 1962, but that's what makes it so good, and original. Belushi, Metcalf, and others bring many of the laughs here, but it is mainly it's reputation that brings this film into hilarity. A landmark in cinema comedy. By the way, screenwriters Harold Ramis and Chris Miller originally were going to make this a film about Charles Manson called Laser Orgy Girls, so thank god Douglas Kenney came in and straightened this out to the right part.",National Lampoon's Animal House
13,tavm,John Belushi is still the main attraction of National Lampoon's Animal House all these years later,10,28 June 2010,"All right, after about 25 years, I decided to once again watch National Lampoon's Animal House which was the movie that made SNL star John Belushi a bona fide film star. I mean, despite his role being essentially a supporting one that was created mainly to provide the most outrageously hilarious moments, he's the deservedly top-billed one that was the reason Animal House was such a big hit and continues to attract viewers today. This is certainly not to take away the contributions of such players as Tim Matheson, Peter Riegert, Bruce McGill, John Vernon, Mark Metcalf, Stephen Furst, and a young unknown named Kevin Bacon. But face it, for the most part Belushi is the show. What probably also helped were such fetching females like Karen Allen and Sarah Holcomb who along with Mary Louise Weller and Lisa Baur provide the ample nudity that I'm sure provided some wet dreams for adolescent boys everywhere. (Like me!) Script by Harold Ramis, Chris Miller, and Douglas Kenney is funny from beginning to end and director John Landis adds some great improvisation of his own to the proceedings. So what more can I say except, ""Toga! Toga!"" or ""Food fight!"" or my favorite line: ""Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"" among others...P.S. As a native Chicagoan, I'm proud that Belushi, Landis, and Ramis also came from there. And, yes, the slide after the credits that says ""When in Hollywood, Visit Universal Studios (Ask for Babs!)"" was retained for the HD DVD but the tours in neither Tinseltown nor Orlando honor the discount or free pass that saying her name originally entailed.",National Lampoon's Animal House
14,edwagreen,Animal House- Is There A Psychiatrist in the House? **1/2,7,25 May 2007,"Funny but over the top comedy highlighting college fraternities and the excesses that they will go to.The film was a springboard for the careers of Tom Hulce, Tim Matheson and Peter Riegert. It also gave us the comedic talents of John Belushi, but sadly we were only able to have him for four years after this film.College fraternities have always placed a tremendous part on college campuses but this Delta fraternity is really outrageous at best.Naturally, the dean of students is made to look like the villain that he is.The ending becomes a slap-stick farce and is exaggerated even as revenge is sought.",National Lampoon's Animal House
15,BandSAboutMovies,It all starts here,7,8 April 2019,"It's impossible to explain to anyone who wasn't around when this movie came out what its impact was. It changed comedy.It came directly from the minds at the National Lampoon. In 1973's National Lampoon's High School Yearbook, writer Doug Kenney created the characters of Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer, who by and large appear exactly the same in this film. Several of the stories of Lampoon writer Chris Miller also inspired this movie.With an original script that was basically page after page of vomit, director John Landis was selected on the basis of his film The Kentucky Fried Movie. He added the idea that there had to be good guys and bad guys.Originally, the cast was going to be Chevy Chase as Otter, Bill Murray as Boon, Brian Doyle-Murray as Hoover, Dan Aykroyd as D-Day (which makes sense, as the motorcycle-loving character is pretty much Ackroyd) and John Belushi as Bluto. Only Belushi would end up being in the film. At one point, Jack Webb was going to be Dean Wormer with Kim Novak as his wife, but he backed out.At the time of filming, Belushi was only a star on Saturday Night Live and the studio wanted another star. Luckily, Landis was friends with Donald Sutherland and often babysat his son Kiefer. Thinking the film wouldn't be a success, he did it for a day rate versus points, which cost the actor around $14 million dollars.That said, without Sutherland, the movie wouldn't have been made.Much like the best of comedies - you will see this as a thread in most of my explorations of them - this is more of a series of vignettes than an overall narrative. The main story, though, concerns College Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) and his battles against the sloppy and silly Delta Tau Chi fraternity.My favorite part of this movie is something that was taken and used so many times by so many other lesser films: the final fates of many of the characters are revealed via text before the credits roll. For example, Babs becomes a tour guide at Universal Studios. Many of the films of John Landis have an ad for Universal Studios that ends by saying, ""Ask for Babs"". That was a secret joke that for a while would give lucky visitors a discount or even a free ticket.Sadly, National Lampoon writer and editor P.J. O'Rourke blamed this movie for magazine's death. After Animal House's success, Hollywood came with money in hand, paying the writers more than they'd ever make at the magazine. But then, none of their scripts would be all that great, which hurt their careers and the reputation of the Lampoon.",National Lampoon's Animal House

17,Scarecrow-88,Animal House,7,12 December 2009,"The celebrated college frat comedy that is probably the most recognized(..maybe, just a wee bit overpraised)in regards to it's influence. When someone even mentions a movie about a hell-raising fraternity of college guys who spend less time studying and far more time partying, Animal House comes to mind instantly. I think Animal House stands the test of time for this magnificent cast of budding young stars on the verge of stardom.You think of Animal House's zany antics regarding sex and slob humor, the movies spawned afterward are certainly more gratuitous, capitalizing on what was brought to popular life in this film. The bar had been lifted and Animal House proved that anything goes and the targets, regarding smart, intelligent people who dedicate themselves to their school and class, while thumbing their noses in superiority towards those ""less fortunate"", getting their comeuppance in the lowest of low brow fashion would be a successful story-line to use time and again. I guess one can say Animal House started an entire comedy sub-genre all it's own. Most feel that those movies which came after this one, while far lacking in taste and exploiting the seedier, lurid elements such a plot regarding sexually active youth and their behavior on and off campus, were not as good as Animal House. That said, this movie benefits from a high energy(..I think director Landis deserves credit for this)and a cast that keep everything lively and enthusiastic. Landis had already cut his teeth with Kentucky Fried Movie, and Animal House was just another step up in his status as a major director of comedies(..Blues Brothers and Trading Places following later, cementing his stature as a go-to-guy for comedies of all sorts).The plot is essentially one fraternity waging war against the other and vice versa. John Vernon is a very disgruntled(surprised?!)dean who wants the students at Delta fraternity expelled and off his campus of Faber University. They represent a pestilence he wishes to see removed from his sight. He will coordinate his efforts at doing this by eliciting the support of James Daughton's Greg Marmalard, the handsome, chiseled dull jock and President of Omega University to find any way to get Delta expelled. Therein is the movie. You have Tom Hulce as a polite nerd virgin who doesn't know that the girl he wishes to score with is 13. Stephen Furst is the amiable fat kid who is constantly ridiculed. Mark Metcalf is uptight, vile Doug Neidermeyer, head of his chapter's military core, out to cause Furst a lot of trouble. Kevin Bacon as a freshman snob who joins Omega and is quite a soldier for their cause. John Belushi as the unkempt, foul Bluto, a college stowaway who remains because he enjoys splurging on the cafeteria food and fraternity booze. Tim Matheson, who is having all kinds of fun, is the ladies' man always out to get laid any way he can, the ringleader of Delta, without a care in the world. His pal is Peter Riegert, who follows him everywhere. The lovely Karen Allen, always dependable with that knockout smile, is Riegert's jaded gal, who decides, in a momentary lapse of reason, to enter a sexual tryst with pot-smoking professor Donald Sutherland(..the most viable name in the cast). One of my personal favorite casting choices is played by Bruce McGill, a gear head who introduces himself by riding his motorcycle up the stairs of Omega's fraternity house! My personal favorite gag is the unfortunate fate of a horse(..ridden by Metcalf)when Furst fires a gun with blanks. In future frat comedies, there's far more nudity, although, Animal House has it's share of bare breasts exposed. While I might prefer Revenge of the Nerds to Animal House, I recognize it's importance in setting a trend, where movies could go for broke and not adhere to a major story-line, while becoming a blockbuster all the same. I think, at the end of the day, that this will remain a pop culture sensation due to it's cast and fun-loving nature. Belushi really cracked me up with all his gross-out nonsense. Matheson pours out the charm, he's irresistible really, and his seduction of Verna Bloom, playing Dean Vernon's wife, is hilarious. The chaotic climax featuring Delta's revenge against the dean and Omega, by way of causing a ruckus during a Faber parade, is a riot.",National Lampoon's Animal House
18,preppy-3,"Lousy film but, in a way, a classic",4,8 July 2004,"1962: Faber College.  A fraternity (Delta House) has for years tormented Dean Wormer (John Vernon) by trashing his campus and wrecking havoc with really sick, immature behavior.  He finally decides to do everything he can to close them down, but they won't go out without a fight...This was a HUGE hit in 1978 (and a hit again when it was rereleased in 1980). I never understood why.  The jokes are lame and the humor was, for its time, pretty risque.  Nowadays it's pretty tame (for an R-rated film). Also I saw it in a theatre in 1978 when I was in high school--I didn't laugh once.  Seeing it again over 20 years later it's even worse.  But, this was the first film of its type (the slobs vs. the snobs) and lead to many VERY bad imitators.  Compared to those this IS a classic.  But still not good.It has some good things in it.  It's amusing to see then unknown Kevin Bacon so young; Peter Riegert and Karen Allen make a very appealing couple (but their dramatic back story is dull); John Vernon is excellent, and very funny, as Dean Wormer; Tim Matheson is also very good--he nicely underplays his role (and flashes his butt briefly); this made John Belushi a star (he IS funny--sometimes); there's great direction by John Landis (especially during the ""Shout"" number); there's a bombastic Elmer Bernstein score that helps and seeing Tom Hulce and Stephen Furst so young is incredible.BUT that doesn't excuse the lousy script; horrible jokes; the sexism; the racism; Donald Sutherland's pointless and lousy performance and the fact that this film is DULL!!!!!!I'm giving it a 4...and I'm BEING generous!",National Lampoon's Animal House

21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not in the intended audience,7,29 October 2011,"The Delta house at a 1962 college is threatened with expulsion, and their response is to do more of what they're asked not to. There are a few subplots(that are resolved, but not in any kind of satisfying manner), but that's essentially it. This is intentional, of course. Similar to how American Pie boils down to a simplistic excuse for crude gags(for the record, I prefer that one to this). My understanding of this is that it's an ode, an anthem(that certainly does seem to be the only point to it), to meaningless destruction, drunkenness, obnoxious, gross and wasteful behavior. Hence all the partying scenes, that I'm sure others enjoy. Maybe it also explains why they didn't feel the urge to make a single character even remotely likable. I suppose they're meant to be as stereotypical as they are(I do wish they'd at least be a tad distinct, I kept mixing them up, mistaking them for each other), and perhaps their actions, at least some of them, make any kind of sense to other viewers. Only the Saturday morning cartoon villain of Dean Wormer, and the posh fraternity, came off as occasionally logical. Why are these kids in such a high level of education if they are determined to learn absolutely nothing? I realize that that's not the right way to approach this, merely explaining why I don't consider the ""bad guys"" in this to be in the wrong. You know, if this did properly communicate that the ""heroes"" were pro-fun and the others were against it... but at the same time, our protagonists are so dirty, nasty, and I'm going in the opposite direction again... the structure isn't bad. Landis' direction, particularly in the ""Shout"" sequence(that man knows how to put images to music so that you really get into it... heck, that was the one positive to Blues Brothers 2000), is good(the chaos created is impressive). The acting is fine, for what it's supposed to be. From a production standpoint, I can barely hold anything against this. However, I don't find much of anything funny in it. Part of it is that it feels dated. I'll also admit that much of this was very new to me, culturally. That does surprise me, as I've watched plenty of this kind of flicks. And several of them, I'd suggest checking out over this one. Yeah, it's possible I ""don't get it""(I'd argue that I do, and it just isn't to my liking). About ten minutes of the final third of this seem to have been some of the inspiration for Road Trip, my personal favorite of the R-rated teen comedy. And if you want something from this period that objectifies women at least as much and actually gives us more half or fully naked ones, go with Private School, or, to a lesser extent, Porky's(only the first one). There is a little nudity, sexuality and swearing in this. I recommend it to the people it was made for. And I do honestly hope this was helpful. 7/10",National Lampoon's Animal House

The Delta fraternity of Faber College can only be outdone by a natural disaster.

Animal House gifted so much to pop culture that even 41 years later we see and hear references to this iconic movie. And who can forget the song ""Shout"" by Otis Day?

24,Wuchakk,A Tale of Two Frat Houses,7,15 July 2016,"Released in1978 and directed by John Landis, ""Animal House"" tells the tale of two frat houses in 1962 at Faber College, Pennsylvania (shot in Eugene, Oregon). One is respectable and filled with rich white snobs whereas the other is a veritable animal house. John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Karen Allen and Kevin Bacon play students while Donald Sutherland plays a liberal teacher. John Vernon is on hand as the staunch Dean Wormer, who's hostile toward the ""animal house.""This is an iconic college comedy/drama highlighted by Belushi, who would pass away less than four years after its release at the too-young age of 33. The movie struck me as a comedy version of ""Dead Poets Society"" with outrageousness and overt sexual situations/humor (of course, ""Dead Poets"" came out over a decade later in 1989). The story & characters kept my interest and I was consistently amused. Some scenes fall flat (e.g. the zit-squeeze sequence) while others were laugh-out-loud funny (the guitar-bashing scene).I'm sure a lot of the movie was based on real-life college experiences albeit exaggerated for comedic effect, sometimes ridiculously so. It's R-rated, but not as raunchy and nigh loathsome as similar movies that came later (e.g. 1999's ""American Pie""). The sexual situations and humor, while somewhat oft-putting, simply reflect the coming-of-age college years. In other words, the movie is honest about the good, bad, ugly and funny that went with attending university in the early 60s and is pretty much relevant to this day.

28,StevePulaski,Welcome to the jungle,9,21 August 2011,"What can you say about a film like National Lampoon's Animal House that hasn't been said already? Because of it being a comedy classic, featuring a hilarious cast, and putting more than one name on the map, I'll make this brief. I feel over-analyzing this film could cause an unbelievable backlash on me. But I have nothing negative to say about this gem.Not only did this get National Lampoon's name out there, but it's the poster child for buddy sex comedies. Every comedy is inspired strictly by Animal House or by a film that was inspired by Animal House. The reason I think this might have lost some of its humor today is because raunchier, crazier, and more graphic material has come out. I'm not saying today's work is funnier, but I'm saying that some classics might appear to have gone downhill, when really, newer more relevant things have come out.Think about The Simpsons. That was quoted by many people in the nineties as being ""the funniest show on Television."" Now, some people think it still is, and some people think it's gone downhill. Personally, I think The Simpsons has gone on for so long that some episodes are either duplicates, similar, or lazily written. Not to mention, hefty competition like Seth MacFarlane and his band of shows like American Dad, Family Guy, and Robot Chicken have come along and go further in their humor boundaries than The Simpsons giving the appearance of a funnier show. When really, The Simpsons has sort of kept the same humor over the years, just more competition is out to share the pie.Enough about The Simpsons, let's talk about Animal House. Aside from being endlessly quotable, it has shown to be profitable, memorable, realistic, energized, and the first of its kind. It has a cast of people before they were household names, and humor that was looked on by parents as ""disgusting,"" when now, it's what comedies are.Animal House is nothing but a big success. It may be victim to some competition with today's films, but a part of me believes Animal House will be around for decades longer. It may never bite the dust. Even if another one comes.Starring: John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Stephen Furst, Peter Riegert, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon. Directed by: John Landis.",National Lampoon's Animal House

30,MovieAddict2016,"""My advice to you is to start drinking heavily.""",9,9 March 2005,"This raunchy comedy was a major success at the time of its release (grossing well over $100 million in theaters alone) and still maintains a strong cult following on home video. It is the gross-out boys-only flick that launched a new wave of rude-n'-crude teen comedies, as well as immortalizing John Belushi as one of America's most beloved comedic icons.It's the 1960s and the Delta fraternity is in trouble with the Faber College's Dean Wormer (John Vernon) yet again. The frat's crazy antics have gotten out of hand and the grades of its students have been steadily declining. Grabbing at the opportunity, Dean Wormer uses their poor grades and behavior as an excuse to kick them off the campus. However, the Deltas fight back  and give it all they've got.""Animal House"" is solely responsible for the surge of teen-styled comedies in the 1980s and '90s. There is no other film predating this, to speak of, which mixed sex, profanity, vulgarity, slapstick and rebellion all into one funny little bundle. ""Animal House"" truly is a revolutionary comedy, for better or worse. Yet in fact for all its offensive material, ""Animal House"" is joyously likable, infectious and agreeable. The writers  Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller  create a plethora of strong characters, which helps define and separate ""Animal House"" from many of its imitators (and indeed compares it to the equally-enjoyable ""American Pie"" series, which  like the ""Animal"" before it  took the time to study and care for its characters, rather than completely exploit them for ""humor""  it's always harder to laugh at characters we don't care about, and much easier to laugh at those of whom we do).Director John Landis (who would re-team with Belushi again in 1980 with ""The Blues Brothers"") not only understands his cast (mainly Belushi) but also his audience and paves a way for sibling genre entries through his realistic slapstick approach (this is not crazy in the same way as Airplane, Naked Gun or Police Academy is  in fact it's far more rooted in realism and only a few sequences really get out of hand and turn into classic dumb slapstick).John Belushi as the alcoholic Bluto Blutarsky (on getting kicked out of college: ""Seven years down the drain! I might as well join the Peace Corps!"") remains the scene-stealer to this day, yet despite the film's close links with Belushi in general he is just a co-star, and when on-screen rarely speaks (a fact played to the film's comedic advantage  when Bluto gives his final rousing speech, it seems to mean something, even ifwellit doesn't.) Belushi demanded the largest paycheck of all the actors  including Donald Sutherland  but is hardly the ""star"" of ""Animal House."" Had he been, it may very well not have been as successful as it turned out to be  not because Bluto is annoying, but because introducing him in smaller portions  rather than focusing on him alone  constructs a fall-back mechanism of sorts; when the comedy is lagging too much, they bring in Bluto for support.Bluto thrives on fun and partying  when he learns of a possible toga party, he begins a chant. One imagines he's so drunk and stoned he doesn't really understand much of what is going on. The film never identifies with him on a personal level. He's just sort of there. And we get the feeling perhaps he's only involved in the frat's antics because it's a blast  does he really care about staying in college? Or does he just want more free booze? ""Animal House"" might not be the best comedy of all time, and I'm hardly going to start arguing that it is. For one thing, it can tend to be a bit inconsistent  the humor is never continuously strong; rather it comes in bursts. Technically, it's imperfect  by a long shot. However, whoever said that the amount of laughter alone defines the greatness of a comedy? Do we need it to be fine art? ""Animal House"" doesn't only have its fair share of funny material and iconic screen moments, but is also incredibly entertaining, rowdy and cool  the quintessential college film and certainly the sort of comedy any self-respecting bachelor would make sure he views at least two hundred times a year. (Give or take.) All together, now: ""Toga, toga, toga!""",National Lampoon's Animal House

After sitting through about 1/3 of Animal House (a movie about a college dean trying to expel the trouble-making Delta Tau Chi Fraternity), I switched it off. It was one of the most boring, tasteless comedies I have ever seen, with unfunny gags, campy acting and annoying characters. Just the loud-mouth frat brats attempting to make trouble from one wild party to the other while, at the same time, trying to outsmart the dean was too much to endure; there was no substance in the humor - just boring gags and irritating dialog one after the other. The kids getting drunk and the crude sexual materials depicted are a shameful representation of how nefarious college life can get - not something I would find entertaining to watch on the big screen.Do yourself a favor and skip this teenage/college farce.

33,sddavis63,Hijinks With No Story - And It's Really Not That Funny!,2,6 January 2009,"One has to give credit - if that's the right word - to those who put together this movie for having essentially launched an entire genre of what would come to be known as ""stoner"" movies - movies with little plot that feature a bunch of uncontrolled and uncontrollable young people engaging in a variety of sophomoric hijinks, with a lot of half-naked young women thrown into the mix. ""Animal House"" was the first. It's a series of hijinks held together very loosely by an almost non-existent story about the members of a college fraternity of losers who are the targets of the Dean's attempt to get them kicked out of school. The cast (featuring a group of actors who would become better known, such as Tom Hulce and Kevin Bacon among others) did an OK job, and John Vernon as Dean Vernon Wormer offered a perfectly dead-pan serious turn in the role. My problem with this movie (and many disagree with me) is that I really didn't find it particularly funny. It has a few humorous lines (""the Negroes stole our dates"" after the gang unintentionally marches into a black night club; ""did we quit when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?"" after the guys were kicked out) but frankly it's mainly nonsense, which might be a compliment, because that's clearly what the writers and producers were going for. My other problem with it is that at almost 2 hours it goes on far too long for this kind of movie. Simply put, it didn't do very much for me. 2/10",National Lampoon's Animal House

35,ElMaruecan82,An opportunity to seriously consider the unseriousness of serious stuff ... got it? ...,9,11 April 2013,"""Where were you in 1962?"" asked the tag-line of ""American Graffiti"", 11 years later. The film was an invitation to revisit the last glimpse of American youth's innocence before Kennedy's assassination and the Vietnam War. The tone was fittingly nostalgic, served by a rocking and rolling soundtrack, to awake in the baby-boom hearts, that just turned 30, the memories of how sweet and simple these days were.As a result, we maintained an idyllic postcard image of the early 60's, I mean we, from younger, more depraved and cynical, generations. And this is why ""Animal House"" works both as the perfect complement and counterpart to George Lucas' classic. The film was released 5 years later, the baby-boom generation was still young enough to cherish those days, it's set in Faber, an archetype of any prestigious school, in the very year of 1962 and  and this is where the comparison stops and where the film's genius blooms. In ""Animal House"", the protagonists, all brothers of the iconic ""Delta Tau Chi"" fraternity, drink, make and play dirty jokes, peep on girls and use the most pervert tricks to get them. They're gross, and immoral, yet one thing for sure, I could easily identify with them and conclude, relieved, that youth hasn't changed that much in 50 years.I make John Landis' comical masterpiece sound like a social commentary, which clearly isn't the main purpose of the film, but again, if the film only consisted on a succession of disjointed gags and sketches, it wouldn't have stood the test of time the way it did. Like many other comical landmarks such as ""The Producers"", you have to look deeper under the stratus of vulgarity to feel the real impact. ""Animal House"" is about of social misfits in the kind of school where order, authority, and love for knowledge are the prevailing orders, yet there is an unconscious wisdom behind the behavior of the Delta brothers, as persons who refuse to be on Faber's knees and spend most time partying, having fun and making the most stupid and grotesque jokes, maybe as safest way not to express an obedience to what looks like the roots of a fascistic system.Whether it's John Belushi making a zit impression, watching a sorority pillow fight, Tom Hulce dating an underage naked grocery girl, Stephen Furst (as Dorfman, the 'fat one') ordered to shoot a horse, the group's leader having a sensual night with the Dean's wife or pretending to have a date with a dead student to appeal to her mourning friends; every moral boundary is broken. There are no rules, nothing is shocking or puerile enough to get the laughs. Like ""The Producers"", the film rises below vulgarity, you have to feel the appeal, to put yourself in the mood, to realize what order and authority produce. Indeed, when the clean-cut bad guys end up killed in Vietnam or victim of the Nixon's administration (a classic ending à la ""American Graffiti""), we understand that these schooldays years have probably one meaning: to allow you to know where you stand for. Our Delta animals clearly know, and the film has its charming way to make you consider their states of mind as options.The film is like a ""MASH"" in school, but this time, I could relate to the characters, I studied in a prestigious school, and 10 years later, the most endearing memories left are all about these partying times and moments of fun with my friends, who didn't want to get in the right circles. I even wish I saw the film before, it would have probably helped me to seriously consider the unseriousness of serious stuff. I saw the film a few years ago, it was fun in the beginning but as it went by and I knew this was going nowhere, I started not to watch but savor every single moment, and it totally won my heart, right in the middle through the unforgettable Toga party. I have listened to many catchy songs, but Otis Day's ""Shout"" tops all of them, the song is such an integral part of my appreciation that I could dedicate a whole paragraph to it. Let's just say, I love this song, and I love watching Belushi dancing at it.The late Belushi is undoubtedly the pillar of ""Animal House"", an accomplishment even greater since he's not the main protagonist, has a few speaking lines, but alone, he embodies the whole film's craziness and carelessness. Watch him rising his eyebrow toward us while contemplating a delicate creature taking off her clothes, we're part of the joke, watch him trying to comfort Dorfman after his car is broken, watch his expression when some bottles are broken, watch him when he empties half a bottle of Jack Daniels, because ""he needed that"", there are reasons why people like Belushi are funny, and many other, no matter how hard they try, will never. Comical characters today beg for our empathy, in ""Animal House"", they don't care, and that's why we love them and love to be one of them.The film is a nostalgic trip from the ""National Lampoon"" generation, the writers (among them Harold Ramis) probably discovered their comical abilities during these school years, and I envy them for that. And what they create is something not only original, but comical enough to be a laugh riot and subtle enough to appeal to more sophisticated minds. Take Donald Sutherland as the pot-smoking teacher giving a soporific speech about an artist before admitting he's as bored as his students, this is subtlety at best, but still, the film offers a hilarious shot on his buttocks that, in the context of the scene, works as one of the funniest moments (which is saying a lot) That's how it works, following the ""Shout"" song, it's a little subtler now, a little subtler now, a little cruder now, a little cruder now  hey hey hey hey .",National Lampoon's Animal House
36,g-bodyl,Still Holds Up Today!,8,4 June 2013,"National Lampoon's Animal House is a classic 1970's comedy that still holds up quite well in today's style of comedies. I assume it is because each generation of people go through the same things in college as the people did in this movie. Many of the jokes are still really funny and the script is actually decent. The cinematography and the lighting does seem to be a little outdated and worn though. This also marks the start of the very short career the late John Belushi had in cinema.John Landis's film really doesn't have an actual plot. It's pretty much a story about kids in college and how they deal with the stereotypes, parties, and the clichéd, but quite evil dean.John Belushi was hilarious. I'm saddened that he really had no career because he could have gone a long way if it wasn't for his tragic death. The rest of the cast is really good as well with some funny supporting turns by Tom Hulce, Donald Sutherland, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon.Overall, this is a funny film that many college kids can relate with despite being set in the early 1960's. I don't find it to be a classic as many people do, but it's still a lovable, coming-of-age comedy in my book. I also must mention of all the ""mean"" principals/deans I have seen in other teen/college movies, this dean is by far the evilest. I rate this film 8/10.",National Lampoon's Animal House

Then he eats it!I have heard many goofy stories about college fraternities. I admit that I have barely seen any college comedy movies. There just don't seem to be that many famous ones around.

Being the first of its kind, the film is so iconic that it inspiree comedy films that are still being made today, the frat house, gross out type films that come out continuously now. It has a fun vibe to it throughout and never gets too tied down to its plot, tossing it aside in favour of long, hilarious sequemces. I did feel, however, that the majority of the characters were not established enough. There is really no lroper development given to anyone, which I know waa probably intentional, but it just made it difficult to route for them at times, cause we were not fully aware of who they are as people. The cast is all around terrific and have a great presence in their individual roles. The highlight is, without any doubt, John Belushi, who steals evety scene with his spontaneous, flamboyant energy. The man was clearly a brilliant comedian and it is always a pleasure to watch him onscreen. Great fun from beginning to end. Hilarious and easy to watch, I would certainly recommend Animal House to anyone looking for a good comedy.

Don't get me wrong Animal House was an enjoyable film and provided me with laughs and that feel good warmth that few films deliver these days but is it THAT good? I really don't think so.It tells that commonly used fraternity storyline where it's the party animals that don't conform vs the snooty frat house and the ""Powers that be"". We'd seen it before this and we've seen it plenty of time since, it's a classic concept and usually a fairly fun one.What really helps the film is its cast, it has a host of familiar and talented faces from those you can name to those you'll just recognise as being prominent character actors for the past number of decades.Notable names would be John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Donald Sutherland and one of my earliest ""Celebrity"" crushes Karen Allen. Seriously, what an outstandingly naturally beautiful girl she was!Though not as funny as I expected Animal House does have laughs and I totally see the appeal.

42,The-Sarkologist,The original T&A movie,9,26 September 2011,"This movie is probably the progenitor of movies like Revenge of the Nerds and PCU Pit Party. It seems to set the style of such frat T&A movies which seemed to become quite dominant in the eighties, only to fade out in the nineties. This movie, though trashy in its appearance, I think is quite a marvelous work of literature as it movies the conflict that exists between the older conservatives and the younger progressives into the campus at Faber University. We see two freshmen come into the university seeking to join a fraternity only to find themselves ushered to the corner with the other undesirables. One attempts to make himself known, only to be introduced to the high fliers of this fraternity, and then moved back to the corner where it is heavily implied (though not outright stated) that he should remain. It is then that they decide to move to his brother's fraternity, Delta House, which is the animal house that forms the title of this movie. In this house we find the people that come to University to have fun. They drink beer, seduce girls, and simply make pigs of themselves because life is meant to be enjoyed. They are the new generation that have reacted against the oppression of the fifties and have stood up to say that they are no longer going to be bound by these rules and that they are going to have fun (it might be worthwhile to explain that this movie is set in 1962). This is the house that transforms into the fraternities of Revenge of the Nerds, and the opponent fraternity seems to simply vanish. Where Revenge of the Nerds explores the conflict between the Nerds and the Jocks, this movie brings the wider conflict of the 60's into the microcosm of the university. Here we see the conflict between those who wish to uphold the ""morality"" and the tradition of American Culture, against those to stand up and say that the foundations upon which the philosophy of freedom that America has been built on us been undermined by the tyranny of tradition and the supposed morality that is forced down everybody's throats. The alleged civilisation that is followed by the university is thrown out of the window in Delta House, where the parties are immoral, and the students simply compete with each other to see how much they can drink. This leads to the character of Bluto. He is what becomes the stereotypical animal character that appears in all movies afterwards. In Revenge of the Nerds, the similar character was very verbose, where as Bluto is not. Bluto does not need to communicate for his character is so shallow, that what he stands for is easily seen through his actions. His character is the epitome of what is uncivilised, yet we seem to have some compassion for him. As we watch him peer into the sorority house and observe the women undress, and then his reaction as one of the woman masturbates in front of him, we see that there is a character that simply throws away everything that is considered decent and simply embraces life. Is it good to do this? Well, there is a lot to discuss here, and when we consider that John Belusi died at 33 of a heroin overdose after living a life similar to this, one can see that it may be fast, but it is inevitably short. Following in his footsteps, Chris Farley also met a similar end. We are given glimpses of what goes on behind the doors of the more respectable fraternities. Bluto, who probably peeks in on the girls frequently, is quite stunned at what he sees, causing the ladder to fall back, and we are quite relieved that we are only given implications of what the woman is doing to the respectable frat leader, especially how she says that he wishes to remain a virgin until he is married. We see here somebody who is following the rules, yet circumventing them for his own pleasure, and what we see is in the end quite repugnant and really are glad that we do not see it. On the other hand, we are allowed to view the bedroom scene in which a young woman and a young man are about to have, what we later learn, to be their first sexual encounter, when the woman passes out due to alcohol. We then see him tempted to take advantage of her, and in the style of what the Animal House seems to stand for, we expect him to fall, but he doesn't. Instead he does the noble thing and takes her home in a wheelbarrow. What we thus see is that behind this attitude of the Animal House to discard the rules, we see respect, whereas in the other frats we see that the rules are twisted and bent to their own ends so as to destroy that which they do not like. As such, the tradition is scorned at while the rowdy Animal House is sympathised with. To put this movie into the category of pointless high school sex romp is to seriously undermine the true character of this movie. This movie stands out not only for the direction it sent comedies in the eighties, but also for the microcosm of the American lifestyle. The conflict we see here is a representation of the conflict that has been going through not only America, but the world for ages. We see a conflict between those who seek change and those who want to stay the same, because the familiar is the safer and to change is to enter into a risk that could be easily avoided if it fails.",National Lampoon's Animal House

44,redryan64,Youthful Rebellion Caricatured,9,20 January 2015,"COMING ON THE crest of the new wave of comedy that was firmly established as a staple in our World by NBC's Saturday NIGHT in the Fall of 1975, ANIMAL HOUSE brought this genre to the big screen of the Movie House. Crude, irreverent and loaded with the double entente, it was essentially a blueprint for success in the area.BEING THAT THE story was set in those turbulent days of the 1960's, it could qualify as a sort of Period Piece. That is not to say that it is a perfect example, for it obviously is not. It is however, a good sort of snapshot of the earlier '60's; before things turned so ugly.AS FOR ITS being labeled as so ground breaking a comedy, we're not so sure. There is so much of the humor and gags owe their genesis to the sort of off colour and uninhibited misbehaviour of the typical adolescent male. ANIMAL HOUSE served as a vehicle with which this anti-establishment sophomoric set of attitudes was memorialized on the movie screen.CONCERNING THE FILM'S cast, we must say that there is no real Star here. Although this features name such as Karen Allen, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hulce and Kevin Bacon and is the initial big screen appearance of John Belushi; it is really more of a group effort, a repertoire team, if you will.",National Lampoon's Animal House

46,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"All R-rated comedy roads lead back to the oft-imitated, rarely equaled ""Animal House""",8,22 January 2017,"No film presents so daunting a challenge to review nearly 40 years after its release as ""Animal House."" That's because no matter how well one feels it holds up after all this time, there's no divorcing the National Lampoon debut from its place of distinction in history as the movie that gave birth to the modern comedy.The passing of these many decades can make it easy to forget that ""Animal House"" was not a contemporary comedy when it was released — it takes place in 1962 but was release in 1978. So the objective of first-time writers Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller was to capture the nostalgia of a more idealistic era, specifically the period in time when they were in college. That's why the film's soundtrack plays a big role in its iconic status. It's also what contributes to its timelessness — the humor doesn't get lost in topical jokes and references.""Animal House,"" the original college comedy, paints a portrait of Greek life from the perspective of two freshmen at Faber College, Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst), who at the beginning of the film rush the prestigious yet white, WASP-y and wealthy Omega house with their fancy formalities. Spurned, they turn to the dilapidated Delta house, where Kent is a legacy (his dad was a Delta). Despite being peed on and windows breaking every five seconds, they feel right at home, eventually becoming ""Pinto"" and ""Flounder."" From there, the movie is mostly a collection of hijinks and sexual screwball comedy built around a basic story: Faber's Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) is embarrassed of the Deltas and conspires with the Omegas to get them kicked off campus.From the film's opening credits sequence showing parts of the campus to marching band music, director John Landis quickly establishes the oxymoron of universities that take pride in all this academia, tradition and pomp and circumstance but in actuality foster a wild and crazy party lifestyle. It's not an indictment of higher education, but a reality check that the Delta lifestyle is what people actually remember about their college experiences and where college adds real meaning to one's life.Because ""Animal House"" is all about humorous twists on the gamut of college experiences, it plays a lot like a sketch comedy show strung into a film. There's no logical order to the scenes outside of the ones that tie into the thin story of Delta being on ""double-secret probation."" So it's easy to pick your favorite scenes or for certain moments to become memorable in spite of what happens in the rest of the movie. That's an important characteristic of ""Animal House,"" one that its dozens of imitators over the years (and to this day) have mostly ignored. The movie was never bogged down by a plot or any kind of narrative arc. In fact, it has one of the most non-traditional endings of any comedy ever made. Yet generations of people have laughed with this film and taken a liking to its characters anyway.Anyone who has been in a fraternity relates to being freshmen like Pinto and Flouder or remembers well-mannered troublemakers like Boon (Peter Riegert) and Otter (Tim Matheson) — and the not-so-well-mannered troublemakers like the infamous Bluto (John Belushi), whom too many real-life college students have aspired to emulate. Even if you were an ""independent"" in college, you surely had a close-knit group of friends with similar dynamics who tried to pull off the same kind of shenanigans.The slapstick comedy including the golf balls, everything related to Niedermeyer's (Mark Metcalf) horse and the cafeteria food fight don't hold up as well over time, but earn a few smirks when you remember the extent of their influence. A lot of what was college situational humor back then is more typically associated with cliché high school humor now, such as stealing test answers, homecoming parades and food fights. There is, however, a subtle absurdity in the execution of these jokes, such as the length of time Landis spends filming Belushi piling plates onto his lunch tray (while snacking). There's a timeless genius to that even if it's not laugh-out-loud funny.The sexual humor, on the other hand, is a bit distasteful now, even though at the time its R-rated proclivities opened huge doors for raunch in movies. Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of the female characters. The scene with Bluto spying on the sorority girls having a topless pillow fight and Mandy Pepperidge (Mary Louise Weller) as she undresses is an obvious example of male gaze and promoting the straight male fantasy, but more problematic are how all the female characters in the film exist solely to gratify the male characters, or they turn out to be liars and cheaters. Pinto's angel-devil conscience moment might seem like the basis for an argument in defense of the film's portrayal of how men treat women, but that male behavior toward women continues to be problematic, especially on college campuses, these depictions are still troublesome. There's a truth to the notion that college guys are preoccupied with getting laid and it's understandable that Landis and the writers would want to play that up for comedic effect, but it's unfortunate the message they send in doing so.Nonetheless, from the toga party and ""Shout"" dance number to Bluto chugging a bottle of Jack Daniels, ""Animal House"" is a giant among comedies. Every modern comedy, even if it has nothing to do with college life, owes it a debt of gratitude. It's hard to see why it was such a trendsetter from 40 years into the future, but it's because how often its fingerprints have shown up in movies and television since that it becomes especially difficult to appreciate how novel it was in 1978. Even in its shortcomings, it has the aura of an unmistakable classic.",National Lampoon's Animal House

51,dee.reid,"The ""Animals"" are in the house",10,29 June 2005,"From John Landis, the director of ""An American Werewolf in London"" (1981), comes the bunch of ""animals"" that started it all. Critic Rochelle O'Gorman commented that ""Animal House"" (1978) works for all the wrong reasons, and that is a correct assertion. There is nothing high-class or PC about ""Animal House,"" as the countless toilet-humor and sex-gags would almost certainly receive the scorn and protests of those eager to censor a movie that does not (read: refuses to) conform to Hollywood standards. Surprisingly, ""Animal House"" is best remembered as being late comedian John Belushi's greatest screen role; his role as the ""Toga!""-spewing brute Bluto is one of the great icons of comedic cinema, immortalized here by Belushi, who's having a ball as is everyone else. But there is a plot in the comic madness that's running amok in ""Animal House,"" and it concerns the epic three-way battle between Dean Wormer (the late John Vernon), the Omega House Fraternity, and the Delta House Fraternity. It turns out Dean Wormer has found a way through a legal loophole in the school's charter to have the Deltas, a disgraced fraternity of obnoxious and rowdy brutes led by Otter (Tim Matheson), expelled off campus for good and is going to use the Omegas to help him do it. But the members of the Deltas aren't going away without a fight, and so let the hijinks begin. As a satire of '60's college life and a low-brow comedy, it works both ways. In today's world, ""Animal House"" would be written off as nothing greater than all of the other toilet humor-laden comedies that we see every year and receives the butting end of so many harsh critiques. The performers fill their roles respectively, nothing more or greater than what is required from them. But the members of the Deltas are some of the most interesting and memorable screen characters ever envisioned. You should also be on the look out for a very young Kevin Bacon as an obnoxious ROTC recruit in one of the film's most memorable smaller roles.10/10",National Lampoon's Animal House

53,jimbo-53-186511,The Frat Pack,6,22 October 2014,"Animal House is set in a college which is comprised of various fraternities. However, the narrative focuses mainly on the 'Delta' fraternity which consists of a bunch of undisciplined, loutish youths who seem more concerned with throwing wild parties and in causing mischief. Fed up with the Delta Fraternity consistently underachieving, college principal Dean Vernon-Wormer (John Vernon) appoints the college dean Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) to watch every move that the Delta Fraternity makes and Wormer warns those in the Delta Fraternity that if their grades don't improve and if there are any more infractions of the rules then they will be kicked off the campus. However, the Delta Fraternity don't take this lying down and decide to fight back against their principal.To my knowledge, Animal House was the first in a long line of teen sex comedies so it deserves acknowledgement for being original and influential at the very least. Whilst, Animal House is a funny film, I'll admit that it wasn't anywhere near as funny as I was both hoping and expecting. The humour is generally of a slapstick or a farcical nature and I'd probably say 90 odd percent of the humour is visual jokes. This humour acts as both a blessing and a curse; it's a blessing because the visual jokes work and they are funny, but it's a curse as well because it is a cheap and lazy way of getting laughs. I honestly can't remember one funny line from this film that was actually uttered from any of the characters. Some of the best comedies will have dialogue driven humour and visual humour and because this film only contains the latter it is a little bit disappointing.It's also surprising watching this today how tame it actually is in comparison to films of a similar nature that have followed such as American Pie, Sex Drive, Road Trip etc. It might have been classed as risqué and gross out when it was made, but I found it surprisingly ordinary in comparison to later films of the same genre. This isn't meant as a criticism, but merely an observation. In some ways, it's good as it showed that films can still be funny without being over the top with vulgarity. That's not to say there's no smut at all because there is, but to me the smut didn't over power the story and I felt that the balance was just about right.What really saves this film are the performances from many of the actors - notably from Furst, Belushi and Vernon. Furst is a particularly talented actor who sadly never seemed to really hit the big time which is a shame - his performance in this film was nothing short of outstanding. Likewise, the late great John Belushi also puts in a memorable performance as the main trouble-maker of the Delta Fraternity (such a shame that he was taken from us at such a young age). Finally, Vernon's performance as the principal at breaking point will also stick in your mind long after the credits have finished rolling - he doesn't get much screen time, but he makes damn good use of the time that he's given.Animal House is a film that is funny and is worth checking out. It isn't ROFL funny, but there are enough laughs along the way to make it worth checking out. If, like me, you're from the American Pie generation then it's worth checking this film out - more than anything so that you can see where it all began.",National Lampoon's Animal House

The film doesn't have too much of a plot, besides the back and forth don't get caught/get back scenarios it goes through, but it's all in good fun, and for the most part, its largely entertaining to watch. The pacing starts out a little slow, but once it gets into it, the film is an absolute blast. The humor and gagas are terrific executed, and the acting from each of the main characters is quite brilliant- in a comedic fashion of course, with Belushi being the obvious and most prominent standout. Of course it's better to not take the film too seriously, as it can be a bit frantic at times, but is certainly worth a watch and worth a laugh. The script is very timely and amusing, and is certainly a very influential and very important film in the history of comedy.

I think watching this film so close to ""The Blues Brothers"" was a real mistake and I don't recommend others try it. Give yourself time to come down off that BBs high before checking out ""Animal House,"" or you might get whiplash.Don't get me wrong. Both Animal House (AH) and the Blues Brothers (BB) have the same sense of humor, lack of respect for much of society's rules and norms, and have the same high quality performances but where one is a tremendously fun journey AH is like BB without its charm.That is its charm in a way, actually. It's the version of that film that you are kind of ashamed for liking. If you are asking yourself whether to see the film or not, it is as simple as taking a look at Belushi's characters.You know that movie you liked starring this guy (John Belushi)?Would you like to see what he did before he was given money to buy a cool car, wreck shopping malls, and perform with famous singers? Would you like to see what he's like when he's not wearing a suit, hat and shades?The difference between the films is that simple. They are both classics, both hilarious, both exemplify an era, but one has never been duplicated (well at least) and the other, Animal House, spawned innumerable homages, parodies, reimaginings, and an entire genre (raunchy college comedies.)There's no way to deny that what Animal House did was usher in a style of film that I am ashamed to say I like. Many of the films I watched as a late teenager and early twenty something could fit into this genre and for that I owe this film a hearty ""thanks for the laughs.""I just can't bring myself to do it though. I appreciate its importance but I can honestly say that I wish films like this hadn't had such a negative impact on my thought life and attitude in my youth. Granted, It wasn't this film that I saw when I was younger and so it wasn't the one that influenced me in some negative ways, but if I find myself thanking it for spawning movies that I have laughed heartily at and have even brought joy to my heart in some dark times, it seems only fair that I also hold it accountable for its influences which weren't so good for me.The film's attitude toward authority, women, and anyone who generally has any guiding principle other than getting drunk, high, laid, and loud as much as possible has been carried forward in many films and our culture as a whole. I won't say whether I think that has been a NET positive or negative.I will say that it has been a mixed bag for me in my life but I can boil it down to Animal House makes me laugh but it also contributed to some negative tendencies in my life and if you are wondering if you should watch this film from that perspective, I might just recommend you hold off.",National Lampoon's Animal House

62,sme_no_densetsu,"""Toga! Toga!""",8,7 November 2009,"In the seventies, the name 'National Lampoon' carried considerable weight in the world of American comedy. The company's first foray into film, 1978's ""Animal House"", established a new brand of cinematic comedy and paved the way for scores of imitators.The story concerns Faber College's Delta House fraternity, a group of fun-loving students whose wild ways have them at odds with the no-nonsense Dean. Naturally, the Dean's attempts to rid himself of the Deltas meet with much resistance of a comical nature.One of the things that makes the film memorable is the well-chosen cast. John Belushi usually gets the lion's share of the attention but the entire cast is filled with memorable characters. John Vernon, Mark Metcalf, Tim Matheson and several others make up a fine comedic ensemble.The direction by John Landis captures the mayhem admirably and is nicely supported by a dramatic score from Elmer Bernstein. Also of note from a musical standpoint is the fictional band Otis Day & the Knights, who provide some vintage R&B, including a lively rendition of ""Shout"".All in all, ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" is a classic of American comedy. I wouldn't expect it to appeal to all tastes but I find that it's among the best (perhaps the best) of the so-called 'gross-out' comedies.",National Lampoon's Animal House

64,inspectors71,Synchronicity,9,22 April 2014,"I don't believe in magic, but I think the production of this movie, its stars, its script, its capturing of the youthful exuberance of college life--coming off the stodginess of the 50s and heading into the hellishness of the late 60s--is quite simply the best comedy I've ever seen. It wasn't magic, but synchronicity. There is a freshness to John Landis' Animal House that I don't know if I've ever seen before or since. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie, but I don't get sad, never get sad at how one-of-a-kind Landis'--and the writers of the National Lampoon--captured such a bright, breezy, sassy, sarcastic, and utterly raunchy bit of renegade humor. I mention getting sad because of American Graffiti, George Lucas' masterpiece snapshot of just about the same time, down to a few months off. When Richard Dreyfuss is flying away to college, and he spies the white Thunderbird on a highway below, he gets a wistful look on his face. Then Lucas, who has set us up (Hey, Greg, look at my thumb!) for a disaster we can't see coming, slaps us across the face with death and destruction. But Animal House isn't meant to be as much of a memoir tinged with sadness as a look at the knuckleheads your grandparents went to college with--and what they were capable of. It's still a memoir of the writers' experiences in their respective colleges, but it's also a celebration of brazen, funny, stick-it-to-the-dean barbarianism. The kids, even the Pharoahs, in AG are civilized. There is very little civilization that isn't hanging on by a thread in Faber College or the surrounding communities. The frat houses are either run by closeted fascists or by, to put it kindly, recidivist non-academics. The dean is a Nixonian lookalike. The cheerleaders are walking Barbie Dolls (but I don't think Mattel ever would have wanted Barbie to be caught pleasuring herself--or being watched doing it).Animal House is the perfect snapshot movie for people in their mid to late thirties (born in the early 40s), who went to school before buildings started to be occupied, draft cards started burning, and National Guardsmen began panicking with loaded M-1s. It's also a great movie for the children of the late 50s--like myself--who saw the unraveling of the optimism of the Kennedy era into the malaise of Mr. Peanut, Jimmy Carter. I loved the feeling of burgeoning possibilities and potentialities in Animal House. When a smarmy character admires a brand-spanking-new 707 streaking across the night sky, he comments to his girlfriend, ""Boy, those babies do move."" The college professor listens to Thelonius Monk and smokes--eek--dope with the curtains down, all under an unfamiliar peace sign. A homecoming float has giant white and black hands clasped, but there's maybe the funniest moment in the movie minutes before it, where a Delta frat boy yells out to a black singer in a black nightclub, ""Otis, my man!"" and the look Otis gives the middle class white kid is beyond priceless. A writer for my hometown newspaper said that look summed up race relations in the 60s better than anything he'd ever seen. American Graffiti celebrated innocence. AH celebrated something grittier, tougher. Which brings me back to being sad after seeing a comedy. I was 20 years old when I saw Animal House. I went on a date with a very pretty girl I worked with at McDonald's. She was 18, but I don't think she had the appreciation for the cultural commentary in Animal House. No insult. I just picked up on some of the darker, more menacing things getting hinted at. I'm almost 56 now. The country doesn't feel about itself the same way it did in 1962. The generation that killed the Nazis and then took on the Soviets is almost gone. We feel adrift. Even 1978 felt more optimistic--it wasn't that long before that the world was our oyster--we could bring it back!And because we are an optimistic lot--still--the fluff and fun, the renegade and raunch, the civilized and the civilized barbarians we were in American Graffiti and Animal House, we can get it back.We can, and that's why I'm not sad.And that's why Animal House is still witheringly, hopelessly optimistically funny to this day",National Lampoon's Animal House

66,mattymatt4ever,Tasteless humor at its finest,8,21 April 2001,"I can see why ""Animal House"" is regarded as a timeless classic among comedies.  When I first watched it, it was on network television.  Anybody who watches this movie on network TV knows they cut out the VERY best parts. So renting this movie and watching it in its uncut format was like watching another (much better) movie.  There are some priceless lines and priceless gags.  John Belushi (God bless his soul) naturally steals the show as Bluto, and will always be remembered for this pinnacle role of his career.  He plays one of those obnoxious characters that you actually grow to like. That's rare in the movies.  Every single character--main and supporting--holds water in this offbeat comedy.  Everyone from Peter Riegert (very underrated actor) as Otter to Donald Sutherland as the professor who gets high with his students.  Boy, I wish I was in his class...LOL.  The comedy almost always works, yet it never gets out of hand.  It always manages to deliver silly, outrageous humor without overdoing it.  And that's what makes this movie so special.  However, it is gratuitous in the nudity department--which is actually a good thing for the guys.  Speaking of nude scenes, one classic moment which always has me cracking up is when the boy is about to have sex with the girl he met at the supermarket, and she passes out on him.  Then a Devil appears on his shoulder and yells out, ""F**k her! F**k her brains out!""""Animal House"" is a joyous adventure through the immorality of adolescence. It almost never fails, and leaves you refreshed.  As long as you maintain a good, uninhibited attitude throughout the film--You'll have a blast!!! Toga!!!!

67,hall895,Just sit back and enjoy,7,7 October 2005,"Animal House is a film with only one mission and that is to make you laugh. And in that it succeeds. If you are looking for a film with some kind of deeper meaning you have come to the wrong place. What you will get here is rude, crude, loud, boisterous humor. The plot is admittedly thin, revolving around the Delta fraternity brothers and their efforts to avoid being expelled from the university. In this kind of movie plot takes a backseat. Here the jokes are the thing and there are enough of them to make Animal House an enjoyable watch.John Belushi gives a truly memorable performance as Bluto. Bluto doesn't have much to say but his hijinks are priceless and he does have one classic speech as well. Tim Matheson as Otter, Bruce McGill as D-Day, Tom Hulce as Pinto, Peter Riegert as Pinto and Stephen Furst as hapless Flounder are also memorable in their own ways. Mark Metcalf as the Deltas' nemesis Neidermeyer gives you someone to root against, Karen Allen as Katy gives you someone to fall in love with and Donald Sutherland as Professor Dave Jennings gives you someone to make you wish all your college professors could be like that. And the music brings the whole spectacle to life, most notably a rousing rendition of ""Shout"".

69,gab-14712,The Birth of the Modern Comedy!,8,18 October 2017,"What do The Godfather, Jaws, and Animal House all have in common? The answer is that they are 1970's classics that have influenced movies the way they are today. The Godfather inspired mafia films/television shows, Jaws began the advent of blockbusters, and Animal House began the R-rated comedies that are prominent in Hollywood today. Before Animal House, there were hardly any R-rated comedies. What this film showed was never showed on the big screen before. Lots of vomit projectiles, lots of sex, and just crazy raucous behavior. People have never seen anything like it butmost of them loved it. I, myself thought it was a very good film. There are many laughs to be had. What I found surprising that despite all the laughs, I could relate to this film because I am not too far removed from college and this film is about fraternity college life. This movie came from ideas out of a college magazine called National Lampoon, and they would eventually became a highly successful production company well into the 1980's and 1990's.What did I like about the film? The script is one of the best written scripts in all of comedy. Harold Ramis excels at writing these kind of movies, and he truly created a funny and unique film. His screenplay hardly wavers and it keeps a consistent tone, although that ends up hurting the film just a tad. The cast is all wonderful. But the standout belongs to John Belushi. Belsushi was an Saturday Night Live favorite and he would become a big comedy movie star after this movie until his untimely death in 1982. But he was hilarious as the fat, obnoxious John Blutarsky. He loves being drunk and he loves starting food fights (one of the best scenes in the movie-that epic food fight!) Another standout was John Vernon as Dean Vernon Wormer. Wormer was an evil dean who did all he could to expel the Delta House fraternity. Donald Sutherland is also a scene-stealer. His performance as an early-60's pothead English professor was spot-on. This movie features supporting turns from Tom Hulce, Kevin Bacon, Karen Allen, Bruce McGill, among others. The film is also well-directed. John Landis is in his wheelhouse with this sort of film, so you can easily tell he knows what he is doing.Are there any negatives? No, not really. My biggest complaint is actually the consistency of the film. It may be tooconsistent. What I mean is that the more jokes there are, the more some may fall flat. There were some that fell flat at times. Maybe a little more than I would have hoped given this film is called a ""classic."" But that is only a small nitpick. I really enjoyed the movie for what it was.Animal House is movie that is mostly about a war between two fraternities at Faber College. The Delta House has a reputation of taking anyone, while the other fraternity is the home of white, rich men that no one likes except for Dean Wormer (John Vernon). Wormer and his frat boys plan to kick Delta Fraternity off campus before homecoming parade. But not if the Delta boys can help it.There are just many classic scenes to behold. There is the epic food fight that was fun to watch. I wonder how much food was wasted during the shooting of the scene. Then there was the parade, which is the end of the movie. This is the parade where the Delta show us who the real fraternity is. If you like music, you'll like the scene where they successfully incorporate the hit song, ""Shout."" Finally if you want to make Dean Wormer mad, all you got to do is put a horse in his office. Overall, Animal House is a comedy to see. It inspired many comedies in years to come thanks to raucous and endearing screenplay.My Grade: B+",National Lampoon's Animal House

The standouts of the actors are: John Vernon as the evil Dean that wants to get rid of the fraternity and John Belushi in his best performance ever as John ''Bluto'' Blutarski, the fraternity leader that loves fun 24h a day.

73,Dan1863Sickles,"It's the Music, Much More Than The Madness",7,10 June 2005,"I'm not surprised that people are divided on this movie. Some say it's a cult classic, others say that it's massively over-rated. My take on ANIMAL HOUSE is that it's a movie that has to be understood in terms of the times -- not 1962, when the movie was set, but 1979, when the movie came out. I believe that the music, much more than the comedy, is what caused the film to become a sensational hit.If you were in high school in the Seventies, forced to listen to gutless, spineless, empty album oriented rock like Fleetwood Mack and the Eagles, it was a staggering revelation to watch fraternity boys from just fifteen years ago partying to songs like ""Louie Louie"" by the Kingsmen. Still more shocking was the performance of ""Shout"" by Otis Day and the Knights. Try to imagine hearing that song for the first time if you were a kid who thought ""rock"" meant Stevie Nicks whining and warbling about ""crystal visions"" and Don Henley rasping listless, creepy nonsense about ""some dance to remember, some dance to forget."" The movie itself, as a movie, is rather episodic, and uneven. Some bits work, some don't. Belushi is sometimes screamingly funny, like when he smashes the folk singer's guitar with a casual ""sorry."" But again, notice how the real point is music -- Belushi is sacred in the movie only because he responds to this music like no one else. He's like a holy fool. He is the one who senses that folk music is a pointless dead end in pop culture. On the other hand, when ""Shout"" is going on he literally writhes in ecstasy on the floor. The shocking thing is that, for millions of teens at the time, this was not a melodramatic stunt -- he really captures what it feels like to hear that kind of rock and roll for the first time.ANIMAL HOUSE is not really a great comedy. But in some ways it is the greatest rock and roll movie ever made -- miles ahead of gutless swill like Cameron Crowe's ALMOST FAMOUS.",National Lampoon's Animal House

The story is about a fraternity in 1963 which engages in constant hooliganism, to the point where the dean of the college finally wants it shut down.After being warned of the dean's intentions, the people in the fraternity of course engage in even more of the bad behavior that got them into trouble in the first place. Big surprise-the college shuts down the fraternity. On top of that, the members of the fraternity's leadership are expelled from the college itself due to poor academic scores-and the dean reminds them that they can no longer use college deferments to avoid the military draft.

This led to an endless parade of SNL actors who went on to have film careers, some more successful than others. Having been on Saturday Night Live, Belushi could have been the father figure for all the other actors in this movie and if you have seen the ""E! True Hollywood Story"" on Belushi it is mentioned that he was quite respected by most of the cast. It must therefore have been both a blessing and a curse to go down in history as the oldest frat boy in the world and that he would only get one more good role as one of the ""Blues Brothers"" for the rest of his life.The movie itself is nothing short of a laugh-riot most of the time. There are so many memorable scenes that it is amazing that it was shot in under 30 days. The best scene is definitely the big parade where the Deltas get revenge on their foes the Omegas and the Dean, but individual moments like Otter lying through his teeth to get girls or Flounder's reaction to the line ""Fat, drunk and stupid etc."" If my recollection is correct, this was the first of what would be called ""Underground slob movies"". Later we got ""Meatballs"" and ""Revenge of the Nerds"" but this is the most high brow of it's low brow imitators.

81,oOoBarracuda,"""I'm a zit!""",7,3 January 2018,"I had only barely seen Animal House before deciding in the opening hours of 2018 to keep the party going with the 1978 film by John Landis. At a sleepover in high school, my friend's father put in Animal House and encouraged us to watch but having just finished Scrooged hours before (not a fan) I elected to play The Sims with the few others disinterested in the comedy. It's not a decision I regret, The Sims is amazing, and I can say with little certainty that had I watched Animal House that evening I would not have enjoyed it. Over a decade later, however, I can happily report that Animal House was an excellent way to ring in a new year and log my first film of 2018. The film that watches like a perpetual party kept the fun alive in a brilliant way. Boasting an outstanding cast including Tom Hulce, Karen Allen, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon in his film debut, and of course, John Belushi as troublemaking college students in 1962, Animal House captures the familiar time in one's life, college, in a hilariously captivating way. Every college has to have that one corner of Greek life that has such incredibly low standards that anyone is accepted into their milieu, for Faber College, such distinction belongs to Delta Tau Chi. The members of Delta neglect their classes, they pull pranks on fellow students and faculty alike, and their number one priority is to ensure that there is always a party going on. Delta is the embarrassment of the college, Dean Wormer, and their fellow Faber College fraternity, Omega Theta Pi. The Omegas are comprised of the brightest, most attractive, and wealthiest students on campus, and will stop at nothing along with Dean Wormer to bring an end to the Delta Tau Chi fraternity. When the two forces join together, they finally come up with a plan to have every member of Delta expelled. Refusing to go down without a fight, Delta focuses their energy on sabotaging the lives of the members of their rival fraternity, and Dean Wormer, himself. Along the way, Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) learn to accept themselves, and others, after being brought into the Delta fraternity. Granted, Delta accepts anyone, including those rejected by all other fraternities, nevertheless, finding acceptance after their worlds have been so expanded by college proves a meaningful experience. Navigating college, and coming into one's own is a relatable occurrence, and one aptly tackled by John Landis's 1978 classic.I went through a spell last year when I was completely obsessed with Amadeus (1984), I watched it eight times in just as many nights. Before seeing him in Amadeus, I hadn't seen Tom Hulce in anything, so it was fun to see him play a completely different character in Animal House. Another fun casting realization was seeing another film starring Karen Allen and Peter Riegert together. In the middle of 2016, I discovered the film White Irish Drinkers (2011) and completely fell in love with it. The film stars Karen Allen and Peter Riegert, so seeing them as co-stars, love interests no less, in a film more than 30 years prior was a complete joy. The best casting revelation, which was a complete surprise, was realizing that Donald Sutherland had a role in Animal House. Sutherland's part is brief, but there is a scene in which he is seen without his briefs, and if that isn't enough to entice someone to watch, I don't know what it would take. Maybe that would just work for me, actually, or other similar Sutherland obsessives. The late John Belushi stars as John Blutarsky, the standout intro that inspired me to watch Animal House, as it fits in with this month's themes of spectacular film introductions. We meet him in a drunken state as he introduces the two rushes and the audience to the Delta house during a party. Belushi has a number of memorable scenes, most of which are the exact scenes audiences recall when reminiscing about Animal House. In an interesting directorial decision by Landis, Belushi's character is kept out of a number of pivotal scenes to the film, a decision Belushi reportedly was, at least on occasion against. Belushi made the most of his minimal screen presence, shining like he always did in comedic roles and breaking the fourth wall in such a way that would make Jim Halpert swoon. Belushi's entrance set the stage for the rest of the film and the party that would follow until the end credits rolled.",National Lampoon's Animal House
82,romanorum1,"A Spoof of Campus Fraternity Life, 1962",8,3 July 2017,"During Rush Week at Faber College, Freshmen Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) visit Omega Theta Pi, the grooviest frat house on campus, but are poorly received. When Larry and Kent approach the nearby Delta Tau Chi house house, a dummy, smashed through an upper window, lands at their feet. Nearby, they notice light- headed Bluto (John Belushi) nonchalantly urinating on the grounds. Delta house is an eyesore, the worst house on campus, and there is little social protocol. Truly an animal house, it features drunks and destruction of property. Tom and Kent are allowed to pledge.Dean Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) has summoned Greg Marmalard (James Daughton) of Omega to his office. He tells Greg that Delta is on ""double secret probation"" because of continuing poor conduct and low academic grades. The dean wants Greg, whose frat house is next to Delta's, to work with him to find ways to ensure that Delta is kicked off campus. So the balance of the movie shows the shenanigans of frat life as Delta descends into oblivion: initiation rites (""hell night""), exam theft, ROTC drill, cafeteria food fight, peeks into a sorority house to gaze at the boobs of Mandy (Mary Louise Weller), toga party, and a road trip to a black club. There is even a scene where hip teacher Jennings (Donald Sutherland) introduces some students to pot. Later he seduces student Katy (Karen Jane Allen). The beginning of the end of Delta House comes during the disciplinary meeting, the Student Court. Delta is accused of several infractions: (1) serving alcohol during pledge week, (2) having low academic standing for five weeks, (3) providing narcotics, and (4) ""disgusting acts"" during the toga party. Although Delta temporarily escapes closing, the day comes when the house will finally lose its charter because of terrible academic grades. Before the frat boys are officially expelled, they plan to take revenge during the homecoming parade. They create ""The Deathmobile"" and ""Eat Me"" cake floats. See the movie to see what happens. At the end there is an update as to the humorous destinations of the main characters.Animal House was the top-grossing comedy of 1978. It was directed by John Landis, who had skill to produce such a screwball farce: He combined different aspects of comedy – such as sight gags, one- liners, gross-outs, and innocent fun – into one coherent film. The insanity of college humor is almost nonstop from beginning to end. At the top of the spoof is John Belushi as John Blutarsky (""Bluto""), a prankish, obnoxious, beer-swilling, trouble-maker who crushes empty beer cans on his forehead and gobbles Jell-O with his fingers. Notified that he will be expelled, he blurts out: ""Seven years of college down the drain"" (his GPA was 0.0). Belushi is in only about a dozen scenes and only has few lines until his ending speech, but his presence is huge. He is well-supported by a capable cast that includes not only those already mentioned, but also Tim Matheson (""Otter""), James Widdoes, Mark Metcalf, Martha Smith, Cesare Danova, and Kevin Bacon (in his first movie). Otis Day and the Knights effectively perform ""Shout."" The soundtrack features pleasing pop songs of the early sixties, but ""Louie Louie"" hit the airways in late 1963, not 1962, the setting of the movie.",National Lampoon's Animal House

Especially when he is walking through the lunch line trying things and putting them back. That is a classic scene right there and it is truly classic material. This movie really is what the genre we know as comedy is all about. The cast was really done well especially with the choice of John Belushi, he is one of the funniest actors of all time and he really proved why when he played Bluto in this movie.

87,mOVIemAN56,Toga! Toga! Toga!,10,29 April 2006,"Such a famous line from the 1978 comedy classic that is Animal House. This movie has set the standard for comedy that all movies have tried to live up too but never quite hit it. The story line is simple, the Delta House on the campus of the fictitious Faber College are becoming the most troublesome fraternities on campus. Dean Wormer (John Vernon) is out to end the fraternity and expel every one of the brothers of the fraternity. Otter (Tim Matheson), his best friend Boon (Peter Riegert), there good friend Bluto (John Belushi), along with the rest of the fraternity, are all out to make the Dean's life a nightmare before they are eventually kicked off the campus. The story goes straight forward, starting with the rush parties, and ending with the parade of the century. A few side stories accompany it and add to the humor. Every fraternity member is unique in his own way and adds to the realism of the setting. When someone thinks realism, they hardly think a 70's comedy will have it, but Animal House is one of the most realistic views of a fraternity, on a comedic stand point, that I have ever seen. Every actor works in there role. Tim Matheson brings the life to the fraternity with his easily likable moods and womanizing ways. Robert Riegert is the more quiet one but has his moments, the scene in the all-black bar is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Belushi, however, takes the cake. John Belushi brings out a simple character with such ease that it is mind boggling. His character of Bluto is the simple crazy brother of the fraternity, His comedy and expressions in the film are among the best ever acted and written.After you look past the superb acting the film brought, you look at the writers. Both Harold Ramis and Douglas Kennedy (RIP) showed they were the comedy writers of their times. Brining so much comedy, so many laughs, and so few points in the movie where it drags, makes their work sheer genius. The film runs just right, just over and hour and a half. The dry points, if any, are quick and painless. The comedy keeps you laughing time after time (I've seen the film near 30 times and still laugh as hard as did the first time). I recommend this to any person who had a good time in their fraternity during college or just anyone looking for a hilarious film.5/5 Stars",National Lampoon's Animal House

90,Hermit C-2,"Often imitated, never duplicated.",10,25 May 1999,"You'll have to excuse me and some of the other proponents of 'National Lampoon's Animal House' if we seem a little defensive about the movie. That's because it's often not recognized as the superior comedy classic that it is.  Instead, too often it is lumped in with the multitude of inferior films that it inspired, which is totally unfair.Some of the conventional wisdom about 'Animal House' is absolutely right, though. John Belushi does give a bravura performance that is reminiscent of the great comics before him like Chaplin, Keaton (Buster, not Michael), the Marx Brothers, etc., and he does it with a wonderful economy of words. His character of ""Bluto"" Blutarsky is often emulated and imitated but many times the persons doing so have no idea what it was that made him and his performance so great.Tim Matheson as ""Otter"" and his other frat house buddies were also prototypes that were much imitated too, and again often without success. Otter was the quintessential smooth talker, always working an angle on everybody, especially the ladies. When a woman tells him that his lovemaking wasn't that great, he cocks his head, points a finger at himself and mouths the words, ""not great?"" in mock disbelief. Before Tom Hanks got ""Big"" he made a career out of playing this character. Also John Vernon set a standard for straight men with his portrayal of the beleaguered Dean Wormer, plagued by his ""zoo fraternity.""Not all of the movie's humor aims low, by any means; some of it is quite sophisticated. (Yes, you read it right.) The screenwriters and director John Landis did a great job evoking Kennedy-era America and they found a lot to laugh at.

92,renegadeviking-271-528568,National Lampoon's Animal House review,8,12 January 2020,"There had, of course, been college comedies since Harold Lloyd made The Freshman in 1925. However, Ramis and Kenney quickly realised that nobody had yet attempted to capture the student days during the halcyon hiccup between the end of the '50s and the death of JFK in 1963.The counterculture revolution that would sweep through America later in the decade had its roots in the liberal campuses of the early '60s. More importantly, at least in terms of dramatic conflict, those same colleges had also organised social life into units that attempted to preserve in amber contradictory and entirely ancient traditions - the fraternity system.While the Animal House treatment was struggling towards a shooting script, Saturday Night Live was busy becoming a phenomenon. Reitman's original idea had been to steal back as many of the SNL players as possible. Indeed, although the writers avoid much character shading - the inhabitants of Delta House are designed as archetypes that any college alumnus would recognise - the parts were nevertheless tailored to the distinctive talents of that famous first troupe.Chevy Chase was perfect for the smooth operator, Otter; Bill Murray a good fit for the deadpan, lovelorn Boon; Dan Aykroyd would enjoy himself as the huge, hog-riding D-Day; and for Bluto, the Animal House's prize animal, there was only ever one choice: John Belushi. Sadly, the SNL colleagues proved too competitive to share equal billing and eventually only Belushi said yes. In the end, of course, Belushi was more than enough.It is a routine mistake to describe Animal House as a John Belushi vehicle. Although the rest of the cast was eventually filled with unknowns (among the finds were Karen Allen, Kevin Bacon, Peter Riegert and the aforementioned Hulce), the script was not refashioned to promote its one TV star. Belushi would improvise if encouraged, but the outsized Bluto was more or less complete on the page.Belushi was well aware that Animal House could be his big break and, unlike subsequent engagements, he was content to be both disciplined and generous - this was an ensemble comedy. Of course, as soon as Animal House hit theatres, the reality was obvious: Belushi, with his cartoon features and signature catchphases, owned this movie. Bluto's animal appetites, alongside a goodly helping of risky sexy stuff, powered Animal House to an unprecedented $142 million at the box office, making it the biggest comedy of all time.The impact was immediate and, together with SNL, Animal House ushered in a comedy revolution that we can still feel today. Indeed, from Elmer Bernstein's sweeping dramatic strings - perhaps the first counterpoint score in comedy - to the gleeful mixture of low-brow and lower-brow gags, Animal House is arguably the most influential comedy of our time. The action may be set in 1962, but the snobs versus slobs are battling for the soul of contemporary America, a war that National Lampoon had been fighting in print for years.Nixon and his cronies, need we be reminded, would have lined up for the Masonic, sadomasochistic practices of Omega House. Although Animal House struck a chord with younger audiences, it was aimed at the class of í62, reminding them of who they were back then and of the world they were supposed to create.As for National Lampoon itself, the brand still appears above the title occasionally, but it has long since ceased to be a guarantor of quality. The patchy Vacation series provided Lampoon with its solitary franchise, but it is Animal House - the original and best gross-out comedy - that remains Lampoon's sickest hour.",National Lampoon's Animal House
93,jcolyer1229,Animal House,9,15 September 2005,"Animal House is the comedy of a generation and the funniest movie of all time. It is hilarious. The dreaded Delta House is the worst fraternity on campus. Its members are known for sex, drinking and bad grades. The assortment of misfits is recognizable. John Belushi is the class clown. ""7 years of college down the drain!"" Otter is the ladies' man who beds the dean's wife. Boone and Katy are the incompatible couple. Niedermeyer is the gung ho ROTC officer later killed by his own troops in Vietnam. ""Drop and give me 20!"" Donald Sutherland shows up as the English teacher having an affair with Katy, one of his students. Dean Wormer's attempts to crack down on Delta are in vain. They simply take their shenanigans to the next level, be it a road trip or a toga party. ""Toga! Toga!"" This is one quotable movie. The statue of the college founder even provides a laugh.

94,jeremy3,The good and the bad,7,3 September 2006,"The good: Very good comic lines. Great line from Donald Sutherland was ""This is my job. I am paid to do this"". Just moments before Sutherland ask his class about Dante's Divine Comedy (and what Satan represents). There is dead silence, indicating that in 1962, students were already apathetic. When Belushi says ""We didn't give up when the Germans bombed Pear Harbor"". Matheson says ""Germans?"". Riegert says ""Forget it. He's on a roll"". When the ""blimp"" and the ""geek"" arrive at the snob frat, Kevin Bacon is hilarious when he is introduced to them. It is a memorable look of disgust. I also liked when Tim Matheson is giving a speech in front of the student council and Stephen Furst, I believe, says ""He's majoring in pre-law"". Someone says out loud ""I thought he was in pre-med"". Matheson says ""Pre-med, pre-law. What's the difference?"". It is also funny that the completely crazy Blutarsky (Belushi) later becomes a U.S. Senator. There are so many classic lines in this movie. It is very entertaining and funny. The bad: Sends a rather immoral message. It's supposed to be funny that the students are lazy, drinking all the time, and flunking their classes. That's not the point of a college education. The snobs are portrayed as almost completely lacking of anything redeeming. I don't find it funny that they mock Greg Marmalard's chastity. What's funny about that? Slight racial bias: It isn't the end of the World, but I was a little taken aback by the scene at the black bar. This gave into the myth that whites should be afraid of the situation. What did they really have to be afraid of? Most likely, in real life the black patrons would have been afraid of starting an incident that would bring the police. This was 1962, after all. In addition, the parade scene where the black and white hand separate didn't make any sense, and wasn't explained. All in all, it was a funny film.

96,antagonist117,"A mixed bag of a comedy, in keeping with the mixed legacy of SNL and National Lampoon",5,12 January 2014,"Animal House draws much of its humor from the oft-visited ""slobs versus snobs"" well. It is also a movie that pits men vs. women, blacks vs. whites, and the dudely bros of Delta House vs. uncool military martinets (they like to spank each other) and sensitive new-age folk-singers (he sings about having no stone and no bone, get it?) To be a wet blanket about it, and to use words that would definitely get me pantsed and hung upside-down in the dean's office, National Lampoon's comedy fits into the same niche that Saturday Night Live has occupied since the '70s of being extremely white, male, and heteronormative while also being impishly anti-authority. With that said, a lot of the tribalism depicted on screen might actually be pretty accurate when it comes to Greek life, even in the supposedly more enlightened 21st century. While in college in the early years of the millennium I knew dilapidated houses like that and dilapidated people like that. The familiarity makes some of Animal House funny, especially when the Delta House protagonists are as much the subjects of mockery as are their opponents. The figure that most often cuts both ways is Bluto, played by the movie's funniest actor in John Belushi. He's a retrograde caveman, and while he's capable of being almost heroic in the limited milieu of a frat, in any other context he'd qualify as a brain-dead sociopath. That's what makes the final shot of the movie, which reveals his post-college fate, so cuttingly funny.

John Belushi is a talented comedian and did a few things that were highly entertaining (perving through a window, smashing a guitar, sneaking around, imitating a zit). But overall, nothing in the movie is particularly sophisticated or brilliant. It's generally fun but little more.Stephen Fry once compared American to English comedy, referencing this movie. The American style involves loud characters who annoy people. The English approach involves people trying to be clever and successful but failing miserably, often being oblivious to various problems around them. I tend to prefer the latter kind of comedy. In general, I prefer it when I like the characters. In Animal House, many of them are likeable BUT they do a lot of stupid and rude things which makes it less enjoyable. That they annoy arrogant, unpleasant characters makes it more bearable.This may be one of the better movies in its genre - the teen sex comedy. But it's not that great a genre so it's really not saying a lot. There isn't much heart to the movie. The characters are empty and don't change.

102,ThomasColquith,"Iconic, but problematic",5,2 June 2021,"""Animal House"" is a difficult film to rate, as people either love it or hate it, depending on their sense of humor. I fall somewhere in the middle regarding these sorts of crude comedies; I can appreciate some of the humor, but I do have my limits and some things can go too far in my opinion.On the positive side, there are many iconic characters, scenes, and images in this film which have lived on in pop culture for decades and have influenced later films of the genre. For example, viewers will remember the ""Shout"" song and dance scene, the cute cheerleaders, the supermarket scene, the motorcycle up the stairs, the cafeteria scene set to the great song ""Wonderful World"" by Sam Cooke, the courtroom speech, the double secret probation, etc. And there is a bevy of good actors including Karen Allen and Donald Sutherland.However, on the negative side, there is excessive drinking and partying, so much so that the viewer just wants to tell those two pledges to run away from those losers before their lives go down the toilet too. John Belushi's performance in particular is over the top; he acts almost simian the whole time. It is almost hard to watch him knowing his fate, that he will die of a drug overdose just a few short years after this film. It almost taints the whole film for me; that level of drug use and addiction is an illness, and something that is sad, not something to laugh at.Another major problem in this film is the inclusion of an underage girl in the partying. While this may happen from time to time at some frats, it is not something to laugh at or give the dignity of screen-time, and it was a major part of this film. There are also awkward scenes at a bar involving race and a dead girl's roommate.So, all in all, while undeniably iconic, memorable, and funny in parts, this film is also very problematic and disconcerting on several levels. Thus, I'll be generous and split the difference, giving it a 5.0/10.0.",National Lampoon's Animal House
103,kingofdanerds,Raunchy and overly exaggerated film that is not for everyone,8,16 August 2021,"I cannot think of any comedy films (with the exception of Airplane and Caddyshack) that have had such a huge impact on the comedy genre aside from Animal House. National Lampoon's Animal House was released in 1978 and was directed by John Landis and stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Tom Hulce, Stephen Furst, Karen Allen, Donald Sutherland, Peter Riegert, and Kevin Bacon. The film upon release was a financial success and was the second highest grossing film of 1978 with Grease being the highest grossing film of that year. Critically, it was not as well received at the time but as time went by, has been often considered one of the best comedies of all time.It is 1962 at a college where the Delta fraternity is deemed the worst (for various reasons) and the dean there puts all of the members on Double Secret Probation but the frat boys at Delta, just keep up with the shenanigans.I can acknowledge that Animal House is a film that has changed comedy whether I like it or not. It is funny because I had never seen this film before and the first time I watched it (which was right before this review was typed up) I was on my second day of college. So this is what happens. I have been told for a long time that this film is the ""best college comedy movie of all time"". Ok, let's watch it and see how clever and realistic it is. I was ultimately disappointed because this film is anything but that. But here is the thing, it is intentionally that way. So, simply put, I didn't care for it right away. But it grows on me, sort of the way that Spaceballs did. Let's get some key things out of the way first. John Belushi was made into a star because of this film and this film is a perfect example of Belushi and his comedic prowess. Physical comedy is what he does best in the film (which is different from what he would later do in Blues Brothers). He portrays the fat and dumb character well enough and has some of the funniest moments in the whole film. I will note that his character does not do much to further the story, but is so much fun to see that I could let that fact slide easily. The cast overall is fairly decent with a few memorable faces (this is coming from someone who is apart of Gen Z). These actors/actresses do manage to hold their own in terms of acting in comedy even if the comedy there is not as memorable as that coming from Belushi. There are bits of comedy which do get a gutbuster from me but largely it is mostly small chuckles that this film would get out of me. For those wondering if this film is for you, then here is my take. This film is raunchy as all hell and for me, I like raunchy. But, I'll admit that it is not for everybody. Sex and alcohol consumption is a huge part of this film but what I could point out that it is exaggerated and if one is willing to except that, then you should have no problem. I will note that there is a joke that does take it too far. Rape/molestation is something should not be joked about in the slightest bit. Especially when it involves a minor. I get that in the film, the character is aware that what happens is bad and has the sort of devil and angel moment but it is still poking fun at rape/molestation where there is to be no fun to be poked at. This film has a good soundtrack with an actual performance of the song ""Shout"" by Otis Day and the Knights.Animal House has most of it's fun and best moments with it's raunchy and overly exaggerated portrayal of college frat life. Not for everyone but worth checking out if you are ever so curious.",National Lampoon's Animal House

You may not have known a John Belushi in college personally, but you remember someone somewhere on campus that was always hanging around campus, so you assumed he went to school, but never saw in class. The success is the muted role of Bluto Blutarsky by Belushi, so when he finally does have an outburst, it's unexpected and hilarious. What do most people remember of Animal House? Was it the time Bluto ends the performance of a guitar player? Was it the impression of a zit? Was it odd dance that went along with ""Shout""? Or was it when the stirring speech asks the immortal question, ""Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?"" If any of those scenes is your favorite, you will know that John Belushi was a part of it. He carries the movie as a background character, but the one who embodies the college experience. The other characters are one dimensional in it's own way, but are effective in moving the movie along. Directed by John Landis, who also directed The Blues Brothers, the movie goes from one sketch to another effortlessly, never seeming to be forced and all have an air of ""ridiculous, yet maybe it did really happen somewhere at sometime."" It is a must see for anyone who has ever been to a fraternity party, or even those who just want to laugh for an hour and a half or so.",National Lampoon's Animal House
106,PCT1970,My Advice To You Is To Start Drinking Heavily,8,6 May 2019,"Landis helms an ingenious collegiate comedy. This classic film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography setting, soundtrack and acting. The soundtrack adds to the hilarity of the film, especially the theme song. The entire cast delivers superlative comedic performances. Belushi however commands the screen and it is arguably his best performance. He portrayed one of the most memorable characters in comedy history, Bluto. The plot revolves around two freshman, Larry and Kent, who first attempt to pledge the uppity and dull Omega fraternity. They end up at the notorious Delta House where they are now known as Pinto and Flounder after becoming brothers. This is where the genuine hilarity begins. While all the excitement and merrymaking is happening at Delta House, Dean Wormer of Faber College has placed Delta House on double secret probation and is hell bent on having their charter revoked. The fraternity brothers are aware of their current situation but continue on with their outlandish antics, pranks, partying and road trips. This ultimately leads to a collision course, literally, with the Dean and his disciples led by the snotty and incompetent Greg Marmalard. Even the character's names evoke chuckles. The plot is clever, funny, zany, wild, blazing, uproarious, raunchy, avant-garde and has a daft ending. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is when Flounder and Pinto enter Delta House for the first time and Bluto urinates on them as if nothing happened. To this day you'll hear fans of this film quoting such famous lines as Bluto saying, ""My advice to you is to start drinking heavily"". It is a masterpiece, has resonated with fans for four decades, is a sublime work of art and remains one of the best in it's genre. This vivacious collegiate comedy has yet to be surpassed.",National Lampoon's Animal House

Okay I accept humour is a personal thing but to say this film has no laughs shows how some have had a complete sense of humour bypass.I saw it in the cinema back in '78 I'd never heard of John Belushi, or any of the cast, accept the guy who played the principle, from Dirty Harry. Nor did I know about National Lampoon or SNL, being a Brit we didn't have them. It was on in my local flea pit and I had nothing better to do, what with only 3 TV stations at the time, I'm thankful for that otherwise I may not have bothered.I have the DVD and watch it from time to time when I need a good laugh, without it I may not have gone to see the Blues Brothers. I think I'll dig it out now, currently there is not a lot to laugh about amind COVID madness.You have to see it if only for the talent that was John Belushi, who, like many with that kind of talent they crash and burn far too soon.If you haven't seen it I can only urge you to do so asap.",National Lampoon's Animal House
108,fredericksmith1952,An often maligned classic!,10,31 January 2012,"Written by Harold Ramis, Doug Kenney, and Chris Miller (the latter two also appear in the film), this is a classic farce in a deeply American tradition of sarcasm, social criticism, and outright contempt for the establishment. The film is outrageous, with non-stop laughs and bare bones comedy that runs from start to finish, making use of nudity, language, and impossible situations to bring together a comedy that has yet to be conquered. The ensemble cast is incredible, the plot nonsensical, and the stereotypes abound. The Omega's are the final stronghold of exclusivity and class separation. They control the student government, the ROTC, the Greek Council, and anything else they can get their hands on. The Deltas are the wretched refuse, the ones who will not be controlled. But is there some deep social meaning in all this? Not on your life. This film is meant to keep you on the floor in stitches, and that is exactly what it does. Not a film for the kids, and definitely not the film to show your kids the night before they head off to college, unless its to say ""Don't do this!"".

The characters and performances were really great. Each character has very good characterisation and their own quirkiness/charisma. The only thing I'd say is some of the characters and girlfriends are a bit hard to follow as some are similar.Story:
Really awesome story that doesn't really have a main plot but several sub plots that make this a roller coaster of laughs. Like I've stated, the characters are well developed and are very easy to follow and love. This is like the original American pie and what a bar it set. This is a old film but is very easy to watch and has aged nicely. The only thing that was weird to me was the ending. It wasn't bad but ends almost abruptly without a solid scene to wrap it up.

These opinions shared by many critics and audiences alike are very well deserved.I have only one problem with Animal House: the movie starts out kind of slow and the humor is really hit or miss during the first few minutes of the film. But after those few minutes, a non-stop laughing feast begins and doesn't end until the credits. There are so many memorable moments in the movie, like the food scene, the hilarious toga party and many more. There are also so many likable characters in the movie it seems unreal. You have, of course, John Belushi in an iconic over the top role as Bluto. But you also get great stuff from the then unknown Tom Hulse, Peter Riegert as Boon and, my favorite, Tim Matheson as Otter.Animal House starts out kind of slow, but after that it's non-stop laughter from a movie that is timeless comedy gold and one of the funniest movies of all time.",National Lampoon's Animal House

Every twitch of his beady eyes, every jiggle of his mighty beer belly, every line of dialogue delivered with just the right amount of bluster or sneering sarcasm -- this guy was a bona-fide comic genius. He was taken from us far too soon.Director John Landis orchestrates the escalating hi-jinks with masterful comedic precision, Elmer Bernstein contributes a very funny mock-grandiose score, and veteran character actor John Vernon provides a wonderful arch-villain as the toweringly evil Dean Wormer.There are almost too many comic highlights; pick your own favorite. My candidates: Bluto's rousing speech about the Germans bombing Pearl Harbor, Pinto's Good & Bad Consciences battling over whether he should take advantage of his passed-out date, and Otter picking up the dean's wife in the supermarket vegetable aisle.Watch for co-writer Doug Kenney as 'Stork', suspected of brain damage. Another Saturday Night Live alumnus, along with Belushi and Harold Ramis, he died in a hiking accident in Hawaii not too long after the movie's release.

117,irishm,Not bad if you like this kind of thing,5,25 February 2016,"I'm squarely in the middle on this one. It had its moments, but it also had its faults. Unlike some other viewers, I didn't mind the bedroom scene with the 13-year-old or the blatant disrespect of the pseudo-military... I'm a product of the 1970's myself and I'm comfortable with the humor of the era, although I recognize that it doesn't translate that well to the present day. However, I thought the ""slob"" aspects of this admitted slob comedy were overdone, and that Belushi in particular was too over-the-top. He was at his best with the subtleties of his character... the classic eyebrow-lift, for example, speaks volumes and is more illustrative of his talent as an actor than the scene where he drunkenly pours mustard all over himself. I don't know how I'd feel about the movie if I had never seen it before and gave it a try... I'm looking at it with a certain amount of nostalgia and it's a completely different experience. I tend to think I wouldn't like it very much. It's true that the ""heroes"" really didn't have much in their favor, and I'm not sure why their triumphs are presented as entertaining.

When you think about comedies, you know that a lot of humor is topical and limited to the generation that experienced it. Other humor is truly timeless, as it is in this film. the first time I watched this movie, I was cracking up. Now that I'm at that post-secondary education level, I know from second-hand experience, it can truly be that funny. The cast, while densely packed with a talented roster, is more than enough to bust your gut. John Belushi, in particular, is a comedic talent that we will not get to experience again for a long time. The dialogue is often silly and kind of stupid, but it's always for a good reason.Mark Metcalf is a fun guy to watch. As he struggles to retain an air of authority, he is badgered every step of the way by the guys of Delta house. The golf scene is particularly enjoyable. And Donald Sutherland, though appearing only briefly, is an intriguing character as well. Seriously, the man can bring quality to even the weakest movie, which this is not.

121,RARubin,3 Stooges with Snappier Dialoge,8,7 April 2005,"Animal House was a changing of the Hollywood comedy guard in 1978. Serious films like The Godfather directed by Coppola or Taxi Driver by Scorcese, which both appeared in the 70's brought the French New Wave and Post-War Italian techniques to America and hence, film became edgier and realistic.Bob Hope, Doris Day, and Sandra Dee dominated the 60's with light comedy, breezy shtick, and virginated sex comedy. Looking back to the early 60's, the Kennedy years, America was not going to deal with those crazy college kids and their first attempts at capturing what was left of the Beatnik Era. With a simmering middle class producing college bound kids in baby boom numbers, the youth culture looked for their own laugh statement.2nd City, National Lampoon, and Saturday Night Live writers and performers finally got the Hollywood green light, so naturally, with pent up baby boomer instinct, they produced the most influential comedy of the last twenty-five years.The boys of Delta are essentially The Three Stooges with snappier dialog. That's the similarity, but the difference is about rebellion and sex. The nubile young girls truly show their stuff. Dean Wormer's wife is a middle-aged Victoria's Secret. The Sandra Dee look-a-likes are daffy and weirdly sexual, almost perverted, not that there's anything wrong with that.Does it hold up 25 years later? This is tricky. My generation will always love a spirited laugher about the old days when we did some pretty risky stuff.

128,puttputtk,one of the most inspirational comedies ever,9,30 June 2010,"Animal House (1978)A legendary, groundbreaking and influential comedy that will be around for a long time. Animal House has been ripped off, copied or borrowed from by almost every college comedy (and many normal comedies) made since. While watching you'll see scenes from Van Wilder, Old School, Road Trip, Porky's, Accepted, and so on. The story seems like a clichéd and replayed story but that's because now, 30 years after, it is, however for its time it's very original. The writing and characters are hilarious and the acting is better than in most college comedies. Although Tim Matheson, Peter Reigert, Thomas Hulce and all the other more main characters are all funny in their own way and all give good performances this film would have been nothing without John Belushi. Belushi is more of a minor character but steals the film with his hilarious lines, facial expressions and actions. The way he chooses to deliver his lines add even more humor to the already funny writing. Animal house is one of the last comedies to come out before the 80s ruined comedies, and oddly enough it is partially Animal House's fault. I'm not saying that all 80's comedies are bad, but I feel most are. Porky's, Police Academy, Weird Science, Real Genius, etc, they're all seem to be the same style and not very funny but are still considered classics. Even the 80s comedies I do enjoy like Airplane and Caddyshack still have the same feel to them but are just funnier. Many of the films (still through the 90s and 00s) force nudity in to films where it is unnecessary and doesn't add any humor usually. Animal House sort of brought on that kind of comedy, but did it better than almost all of them, even the nude scenes are funny, not just there to bring guys in. Its truly a influential film, let alone comedy. Although it may be the responsible for inspiring some terrible films over the years, it has also inspired some of the best.

Some of this nonsense still remains but obviously this over the top romp defined the strange era and culture of the 60s. This film is merely about two young new college students who pledge a rowdy fraternity and, after a multitude of excess, decide to take revenge on the snooty wealthy fraternity and the university administration that wants to get rid of them.As the top review here states, this movie is often imitated and borrowed from but is never ever close to the original. This is because the talent level is so strong, the lines are general witty and the originality of being first stands out. It's fresh. For those who didn't like it, I doubt they'd like any movie of similar, childish and ridiculous nature. But the topic is what it is. So be forewarned that the language, lewdness and immaturity is what this movie is about. And if you have no patience for it, don't bother watching. It's not a documentary. You're not going to learn anything about history except peer a little into what life was like back then taken to some extremes, although less in some instances than you'd believe.Lines like ""Assume the position"" and ""Thank you sir may I have another"" are just two of numerous quotes that have become commonplace in contemporary American speech.

Preppy-uptight fraternity vs. sloppy,-relaxed,-and-lovin'-it fraternity. That's all it is. Now hit reverse back to the beer and togas. Animal House succeeds at capturing the party spirit of college, and John Belushi as Bluto Blutarski is the one at the wheel guzzling that bottle of Jack Daniel's. When the film's not a Belushi tour de force, John Vernon as Dean Wormer provides an excellent Skeletor of a villain. My favorite scene is the trial of the Delta House, when Otter (Tim Matheson) takes order and punts it like a truly maniacal lawyer, all the while backed by his brothers.

137,brownish33,"Really? a ""classic""? thats a joke right?",1,21 September 2010,"firstly i am not a fan of the genre of ""teen sex comedies"". i perhaps wasn't informed about this movie, i thought it would be just a funny old school screwball comedy. boy was a wrong. i think its just the stupid perverted side of Hollywood. i feel bad that harold ramis aka Egon has anything to do with this crap, since i love most of the other films hes written or been attached too, especially ghostbusters. sure teens do think about sex because its a natural part of growing up and discovering your own sexuality, but wow i mean WOW they make having sex sound like its no big deal in these films! perhaps to these jaded filmmakers, but not to the whole country. and guess what, this film started it all. i guess thats why i decided to pick on this film instead of all the other gross out films that came after it. perhaps it was successful because there hadnt been many movies like this yet, and it was probably looked at as one of a kind (until now). this is like the granddaddy of sex comedies, or as i like to call, soft porn Hollywood style. from this one retarded brainless flick we got a whole 3 decades worth of similarly retarded brainless flicks like the American Pie movies, Fast time at Ridgmont High, Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds and the countless other asinine so-called ""comedies"" that were unleashed upon the public in its wake. first off there may be college ppl out there who love to party but this movie does things that i heavily doubt ever happen in real life. its too ridiculous. first off i hate college culture, heck i hate the whole school culture of today, which is why i was happy to finally get out of high school and simply take night classes to get my certification in nutritional health. i am still working towards that. college, as in regular living-in-dorms college, is overrated and ridiculous. you don't really learn anything and the kids are obnoxious. now you can see why i hate college. this movie just intensified that hatred. every minute of watching this dreck made me thankful that i decided not to go the typical college route and avoid people like this. i guess i shouldn't blame the movie SO much as it knew what it was trying to be, as vulgar and gross as it was. but if it was supposed to have a point other then being stupid, then it failed. Jim Belushi isn't funny. thats a fact. even in blues brothers, it was Dan akkroyd who was funny. not the fat one. no wonder he died. he probably couldn't handle the fact that people seemed to only think he was funny cuz he was fat. i wouldn't want to be him. same with Chris Farley. i would have given up all the fame and money and be fit and healthy (not to mention ALIVE) instead of be a fat tub of goop, trying your hardest to look ugly beyond all hell and made out to look like a retarded idiot in films. poor guys. i pity them. and its hard to watch there movies for that reason to, aside from the fact they are not funny but just gross.in the end, this is a genre of movies that if wiped off the face of the earth in a big fire, the earth would benefit from it for we wouldn't have to see such useless pointless garbage ever again.",National Lampoon's Animal House
138,TheOneManBoxOffice,The movie that made John Belushi an immortal figure of comedy.,10,28 August 2016,"When people first hear the name National Lampoon, some would think of the parody magazine that existed way back when as a competitor to MAD. However, most people would think of the four Vacation movies starring comedian Chevy Chase as the clumsy family man Clark Griswold. But National Lampoon was also known for one other thing: being behind one of, if not, THE greatest frat comedy in film history. That movie is National Lampoon's Animal House, the film that would make the late John Belushi a household name next to Saturday Night Live and eventually The Blues Brothers two years later.The plot is rather simple: it's 1962, and two college freshman, Larry and Kent (Tom Hulce and Stephen Furst respectively) are new to Faber College and want to join a fraternity. They first go to Omega house, which is full of nothing but stuck-up snobs that would make the folks of Downton Abbey blush, some of which include Doug Niedermeyer (Mark Metcalf) and Greg Marmalard (James Daughton). Then they decide to check out the most notorious fraternity on campus, which they ultimately choose, the Delta house, full of sex-crazed, fun-loving, drunk reprobates that are not afraid to sing ""Louis, Louis"" all night long, with Bluto (John Belushi) being the one that steals the show. However, what the folks at the Delta house don't know is that the Dean, Vernon Wormer, is desperate to expel the fraternity for all of the hi-jinks they've pulled off, even to where he secretly puts the whole house on ""double secret probation"". Does this stop the Deltas? Well, take a guess. What follows is some of the funniest live-action slapstick ever put to screen.The name ""Animal House"" is quite fitting for this movie, as the Delta fraternity is nothing but animals that make the college their own personal playground at the expense of Wormer and the Omegas. They get more angry, while we sit and laugh at their antics, one after the other, leading up to the ultimate ending where the Delta house strikes their ultimate blow against their oppressors. It's like an early epic comedy on par with Hot Shots or any of Mel Brooks' films, only its satire is not anything based on pop culture, but on college life as a whole. When I first watched the film at the age of 13 (thanks Dad), it was probably the funniest movie I've ever seen up to that point. Some of the scenes that still manage to get a chuckle out of me include the ROTC scene where Kent is yelled at by Niedermeyer while two of the head Deltas are aiming golf balls at his horse, the girl's dorm scene with Belushi, the cafeteria/food fight scene, and yes, even the entire Toga Party segment. Today, almost 40 years after the film's release, the movie is still one of the greatest comedies ever made. What makes me love this movie even more is that it was filmed in my home state of Oregon (REPRESENT!!!), and I even got the privilege to see it in the movie theater a few days ago with a friend of mine as part of TCM's BIg Screen Classics series. A fun time at the theater was had by all.If you want to know where famous college movies like American Pie, Old School, and Revenge of the Nerds got their sense of humor, you need not look further than this film right here. I cannot say much more on how much I love this movie without repeating myself, so all I can really say is simply this: see this movie if you haven't.",National Lampoon's Animal House
139,jimmylee-1,Enjoy it while it lasts!,7,2 July 2006,"This movie brings back the best and most creative part of my college life, so it's a sentimental favorite for me and should be required viewing for those college freshmen who are homesick. You can't be missing your parents when you're tipping cows and painting dorm elevators submarine gray or Chinese dragon red at 3am.This movie was a happy reminder that college was not just about preparing for ""life"" (which is really an endless tunnel of work / responsibilities surrounded by humourless tie-wearing sorts - how come they never told us?), but about learning important social skills and having a hell of a lot of fun.It was entertaining, believable (for me!), and the acting was solid. Tim Matheson - who didn't think he was the coolest ever (and enjoy Jonny Quest all the more)? John Belushi - was the part made for him or what? Donald Sutherland gave his professor a nice oily finish so appropriate for the times. John Vernon added Dean Wormer to the college lexicon. And Tom Hulce - well, who knew this was just a stepping stone for him? I guess the casting director had amazing perception, picking not only Hulce but Kevin Bacon for the film. The Fawn Liebowitz road house joke ran a little long (maybe that's because I've seen the movie about 15 times), but it's endurable. I love horses, but I'm an adult and can enjoy the dark humour. I'm not a huge slob humour fan, but nonetheless, every time I see the Animal House food fight, I'm snickering away like I was back in the dining commons lobbing jello at my ex-boyfriend's annoying new girlfriend. Since there must be something in life that goes my way, I'm sure her butt is now the size of Nebraska and he's living a life filled with wistful thoughts of me.So every time I see the movie, I'm all happy and nostalgic about my college days. It even makes me think of pranks I could be doing at my current faceless corporation. Like building a lovely lounge sculpture of all that faceless furniture. Hmmm.",National Lampoon's Animal House
140,EnoVarma,A perfect movie,10,27 February 2018,"Animal House is not just funny, it's fun. John Landis didn't just do technically accomplished work, but he was able to translate the air of fun from the shoot to the screen. Every single actor is completely relaxed here, not so much acting as just being.Animal House didn't just comment on the zeitgeist, it influenced it. In real life the actions of its protagonists would be shameful, but on the silver screen, they become a manifesto of the counter-culture. Those who obey the rules are always shown as uptight, thinly veiled nazis, while their adversaries (our heros) celebrate life by having fun in every which way they can.It requires a high intelligence to create something this stupid. The jokes and actions in the film are idiotic, but they are so well put together and so layered that they feel authentic. Kinda like Laurel & Hardy comedies, but much, much ruder.Animal House still feels fresh. Must be its anti-establishment ethos, which just never gets old. Or, it's just fun. And fun is never ""over"".

The dialog (a first class script); the slapstick (what a cast...perfect!); the unexpected plot twists (I have watched this movie twenty times and they never cease to amaze me) are all perfect. Just to watch John Belushi walk is a rare treat. You will laugh hysterically. And, let's face it, you WILL be offended, deliciously. But that's the best part. This movie never takes itself too seriously. Which is not something one can say about the last decade's comedic offerings. This is a good opportunity to remind oneself of the not-too-serious moments of academic life. And a great opportunity to be reintroduced to the music of the 60's. Enjoy early Tim Matheson; early Kevin Bacon and a wonderful cameo as a sleazy professor from Donald Sutherland. It's hard to believe Animal House was released over twenty years old.

Well, obviously insipiringly, as every college comedy in the last 30 years seems to have 'borrowed' from it.The plot is, well, the plot, and you'll find it elsewhere.What makes this film shine are the performances, particularly John Belushi who steals every scene he's in. How sad that we lost this clown, he could've gone on to a career that rivalled Charlie Chaplins, he's that wonderful without words. His face was so expressive, he didn't even need lines.John Vernon was the perfect foil for him, the ideal villain. Dean Wormer (perfectly named) was the character that could've been the hardest to believe, and yet he made it all real, and I actually cared for him a little bit at the end.Tom Hulce, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Verna Bloom, Peter Reigert- this cast is amazing and they all look like they're having the time of their lives.Kudo's to director John Landis for bringing it all together and yet keeping that anarchic spirit that seems to belong to the college years.

This movie could never be made today without a horde of trigger-happy Karens storming Hollywood's gate.""My advice to you is to start drinking heavily.""It's been over a decade since I've seen Animal House, but it remains a partying classic (even if it is offensive at every turn). Maybe because I'm older, maybe because I'm still in my partying prime (or at least I think so), or maybe it was my brief stint as a college frat boy (I'm not proud of it), this movie hits different for me.Everyone in the cast were brilliant but watching the late (and great) John Belushi was so bittersweet. He steals just about every scene he was in and brings in all of the laugh-out-loud moments. He has so many great one-liners, it's hard to pick a favourite.""Oh no! Seven years of college down the drain!""""See if you can guess what I am now...(fills mouth with mashed potatoes only to spit it out at frat bullies)...I'm a zit! Get it?""With a budget of only $3 million, this movie made $141 million... that's just insane! Low budget movies for the win!There's so much to like and so much to laugh at, but if I had to put on my ""movie critic"" hat, everything to do with the dean and the opposing frat is about as generic as it gets. Dean wants misfit troublemaking frat house gone, so he works with the rich, boy scout frat house to make it so.Regardless, this was a laugh-out-loud, insanely crazy, non-stop party, even if it treads familiar territory. But be warned, this will definitely offend some (probably many) people today, but it's just because they don't make movies like this anymore.Score: 8 out of 10

It was a nice nostalgia trip to see how many cartoons have taken bits from this but that's it. Otter is an odd character. He's supposed to be the cool one but he's as dimensional as a piece of paper. Bluto is odd and I'm not convinced Belushi has as much talent as he's given credit for. Dieing young might have been the best thing for his reputation.

It's just a good, fun movie to watch that makes no apologies for what it is.  This movie came out during the same time as such movies as ""Up in Smoke"".  This was movie-making for the pure fun of it and for pure guilty indulgence.  This movie marks the first big screen appearance of John Belushi.

The film isn't so much about college as it is about the deltas overcoming their hardships, which include but are not limited to.....ridiculously low grades and a dean that has it in for them because of their previous college antics. If you haven't seen Animal House, you are really missing out on something. We have Kevin Bacon here in a small role(Thank you sir, can I have another!!??) which I think is his first. But the real showstopper here is John Belushi as Bluto, an obnoxious but hilarious character in the film. Just watch him go through the lunch line and end the scene with the 'zit' joke at the snobby frat's table.

The group is despised by its rival, the Omega fraternity, and the Dean of the school, Vernon Wormer, who wants nothing more than to get rid of the members of the Delta House.This is a fine ensemble cast. John Belushi is good as Bluto, who loves to drink and party more so than anyone in the fraternity. Tim Matheson gives a very respectable performance as Otter, Faber's resident womanizer. Peter Riegert also deserves mention for his portrayal of Boon, who always has a one-liner at the right time. John Vernon cannot be left out, for he is completely believable as Dean Wormer. I can't mention every cast member, but believe me when I tell you they all do a good job on screen.The laughs come regularly in ""Animal House,"" and are not limited to the words in the script. The facial expressions and actions of the characters create moments of amusement as well. I'm not giving anything away. You'll have to see it.This is a truly funny movie.

151,zhongzl-kelley2014,Good story-telling but serious twisted minds,5,1 September 2016,"I have no critiques about the story-telling techniques. The acting is realistic, angles are comfortable and fluent, music is light and uplifting, but some values preached by this film is serious unacceptable to the society.First of all, let's look at all the characters that prevail in this movie: the infamous fraternity Delta, in which of course there are no African Americans, Asians, homosexual members or others. So clearly diversity is not a theme of the film.What kind of people thrive in Delta? Low-graders, drunkards, trouble-makers, people who indulge themselves in excessive sex life and endless partying and a brotherhood that is based on breaking the law and causing extreme discomfort to everyone around them. And of course the handsome-looking chef of a prominent fraternity makes a farce out of himself by believing a vicious girl's lie and is convinced that his girlfriend is stolen from one of the Delta members, and his girlfriend miraculously fall for the retard Delta member. And the good-looking uniformed officer gets himself knocked down from a horse, and his horse dies of a heart attack.In this film, doing things without thinking about consequences is bravery, alcohol overdose and obscene sex fantasy are the beauty of youth, trespassing the rules of society equals to thinking outside the box and breaking the status quo, and the high-achievers are the ones to be defeated, the losers are the ones with glare of heroes. I respect freedom of speech, I really do, but I still think the director needs to kneel to the ground and apologize to whoever come to believe any core values expressed by this film after watching it. However, I am forced to comment on the comedy elements of this film. Many classic lines from this film will always resonate in my brain during my college life.

It is a raunchy, lewd, crude, and sometimes offensive comedy.  It is also one of the funniest movies ever made.  While Airplane! has exploited the most inane of comedy (to winning effect, I might add), Animal House shows a great knowledge of human behavior, insecurity, college life, and human truths, and then spins it all on its head to great delight and amusement.  The opening scene which shows two Freshman pledging a fraternity where they are clearly not wanted is the first of many laughs that rely on our sophisticated view of the world.

Many comedies are just the protagonist getting in plenty of wacky situations, but the movie has no real direction. Animal House is one of these comedies. It has some of the funniest moments I have ever seen on a movie screen, but throughout the movie several different plot lines are introduced and none of them are tied up. Two boys go to a frat to get accepted, but we don't really know if they were accepted in the end by the people there. The entire fraternity is in danger of getting kicked out of school, but instead of sticking it to the man, they just decide to give the dean no choice but to kick them off campus.

While some find it to be outdated, I still can't get enough of this hilarious laugh-fest. Harold Ramis sets the precedent with a film that redefines the comedy genre as a whole. While his other films such as Ghostbusters, Caddyshack, and Stripes are also extremely entertaining, Animal House still remains one of the best.Faber College is a high society college that prides itself on the devotion of it's students. Dean Wormer's (John Vernon) tenure has quite the list of accolades, including extortion. Most of the fraternities on campus are well-behaved and organized, with one exception: The Delta House. We get our first taste of the Delta fraternity when Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) and Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst), visit them while browsing the campus' frat houses as freshman in 1962. Delta's long list of comedic members include: 'Boon' (Peter Reigert), D-Day (Bruce McGill), Robert Hoover; the chapter President (James Widdoes), 'Otter' (Tim Matheson), and last, but not least: 'Bluto' (John Belushi).The Delta House is placed on ""Double Secret Probation"" after pushing Dean Wormer over the edge with their disgusting antics on campus. After receiving this warning, the Deltas continue to throw parties, torture the arch-nemesis fraternity headed by Douglas C. Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), and play pranks on the college. The end result? Expulsion from the college.Just when the Delta's are down and out, we get to witness one of the most hilarious and entertaining revenge plots in cinema history! Animal House is simply the most entertaining comedy in existence, and is a trademark film from the late 70's.

That being said, I must say that it was not an entirely bad movie.  I laughed now and then, I sensed a certain bond with the characters on screen in front of me, but I never felt like I was watching something all that special.  It was a movie about stereotypes, and it was only when the characters did something that surprised me that I laughed.

Animal House set the standard a long time ago for movies like this.A bit of a disclaimer since people have different opinions: if your idea of good comedy is Spinal Tap and Dr Strangelove, or if you are English English (you know what I mean), then you may not like Animal House.",National Lampoon's Animal House
164,Newguy,They Just Don't Make Them Like This Anymore,10,5 November 1999,"Back in 1978 I was 9 years old.  My aunt and uncle came over to see my parents before the movie started.  On the way out my aunt turns to me and says ""do you want to come with us?""  I was 9 and had never seen an R rated movie ever.  For some reason my parents didn't mind, so out the door I went. I have probably seen this film about 200 times since then and every time I watch it, I still laugh out loud about something.  Brilliantly acted and even more brilliantly written, ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" is not only the standard by which all youth oriented (Under 35) comedies are measured, but it really started it all.  I am a huge fan of the Blues Brothers, but Animal House is truly Belushi's crowning cinematic moment.  The one liners are endless and if you set foot at any college today or within the last 20 years, a week doesn't go by without somebody quoting or making reference to this film.  It is a true piece of Americana, a definitive cinematic achievement.  Any other film that remotely emulates it pales in comparison. Everything about this film is so good, right down to the way they depict college life, the parties, the rivalries and the outright hatred and disregard for the ""establishment"".

Maybe it's just that I was in a fraternity in college, although there was never a fraternity to compare to Delta Tau Chi. ""Animal House"" was the first of the great ""slob comedies,"" and without it, movies like ""Caddyshack"" and most of the other imitations of the last 27 years could never have happened. Imagine all the things they did that couldn't be done in a movie now -- ""I'm only 13,"" casual drug use and ""the Negroes took our dates."" But of course, the movie comes down to the one great philosophical line -- ""You f***ed up, you trusted us."" I have probably watched this movie 50 times and I hope to watch it 50 more.

166,pk19652001,Still the best,10,26 April 2013,"Probably watched this movie more than any other movie in my viewing life. Still funny as heck. Its on cable allot lately, so when nothing is on, I can always watch this and get constant laughs like usual. Its the best comedy, bar none. Sorry folks who like the newer stupid comedies that flood the movie screens nowadays, but this is the Casablanca of comedies. So many classic one liners and just funny scenes, too hard to go through them all. From the top party of all time in TV history (yes, the Toga Party) to the fat drunk and stupid line from good old Dean Wormer, its truly a classic. Every actor in this movie is perfect. No bad performances. Even Bluto saying to himself, wtf, and poring a jar of mustard on himself for no apparent reason is funny. I continue to see new funny stuff every time i watch this. This last time around, I found another classic scene. In the beginning, Just as D-Day blast the door open with is motorcycle, look for a guy standing next to the door. He gets totally blasted against the wall as D-day drives up the stairs. Funny stuff. When I was younger, this was the movie my friends played in college or at summer houses and parties. It truly is the (how to party for dummies) movie for sure.....",National Lampoon's Animal House
167,TBoldOne,The End of Innocence = Popularity,10,26 December 2010,"This movie was the sleeper of the year. Made on a ridiculously low budget it went on to virtually define the comedic movie format for the next twenty years. The mystery of course is why it resonated so much with audiences in the 70's. I have several theories.1) The time period is set in the early 60's. This is just before the country went insane . College was a time to have fun. Vietnam was on the horizon, but not there yet.2) The stereotypes went well with the time period. You just knew that the preppy fraternity portrayals were not too far from reality. Anyone who rushed a fraternity in the 60's and 70's could relate to how the rushee's were treated at the respective fraternities. Some houses you just knew you were NOT going to be invited into. This is really how it worked back then.3) The simple good versus evil plot line was not overdone. The bad guys were plausible in their badness. You knew people like Marmalarde, Chip, and Neidemeyer, either in college or real life. Bluto, Otter, and the other Delta's acted LIKE we wished we could/would.4) The jokes have a weird innocence about them. Jokes that should be totally offensive are just funny. Killing a horse should not be funny, yet it's hilarious. Peeping into a girls sorority house should be creepy, but Belushi makes it funny. (I think what makes this gag work is that Belushi is so overwhelmed by the girl of his dreams hotness, that the only thing he can do is pass out. His reaction is authentic, thus hilarious.) 5) There are so many great one-liners, ""Thank you God."", ""Germans? Forget it he's rolling."", ""Fat, drunk, and Stupid, is no way to go through life, son."" One caveat, don't over watch this movie. You could ruin it for yourself. About once every 2 years keeps it from getting stale. You'll see something you haven't seen before. Like good wine, it ages well.A fun joyful movie",National Lampoon's Animal House
168,imnotjohncandy,A Wild Party from Start To Finish,10,22 June 2012,"Hello i'm Nathan aka Monstermaster13 and this is another look back. This time i'm looking back at one of the most well comedy movies of all time.About a group of misfit college studies fighting back against the Dean and the Omegas as well as a certain man by the name of Doug (No...not Doug Walker or Doug Funnie...I mean Doug Neidermyer) I'm of course referring to National Lampoon's Animal House, this classic 1978 comedy does a playful and enjoyable spin on life on college campus.This movie has left a massive impact on pop culture and inspired many other comedy movies in the genre. Many have tried but fallen flat (i'm talking about you, American Pie sequels and Seltzer and Friedberg).The plot behind this takes place at Faber College, first there's the Omegas who are the antagonists along with Doug Neidermyer and Dean Wormer.Then there's our protagonists - the Deltas, considered to be the worst house on campus - this assortment of oddball characters are the complete opposite to the Omegas (who are upper-class and snobbish).There's Flounder, who is a portly and clumsy but still kind of innocent and naive freshman who is one of the two new additions to this group. He makes for a very lovable character and has some truly wonderful scenes, especially near the end where he participates in the destruction of the homecoming parade.Then there's the other new guy on campus, Pinto - who is very shy and pretty much one of the only normal people in the group of misfits.D-Day is a biker type, he's tough and not to mention has some really badass moments. Plus he's a really skilled mechanic.Otter is somewhat of a ladies man and the main man in charge of the campus, Boon is always trying to decide between Katy (his love interest) and his delta buddies, Stork is a nerdy type (who was thought to be brain-damaged) and there's Hoover (the official President of Delta house and the one with the highest G.P.A).And of course there's the resident lay about/slob Bluto (played wonderful by the late great comedian John Belushi) who has the funniest scenes in the movie including starting a food fight. This chubby but manic and off the wall character is the one that most people remember and is featured on many posters featuring him in the ""College"" sweater.This movie is a spin-off of the popular National Lampoon magazine and is inspired by the many outlndishly funny experiences that the editors of the magazine had when they were in college.John Landis does a fantastic job directing this movie and the cast all do superb in their roles especially Tom Hulse as ""Pinto"", Stephen Furst as ""Flounder"" (as a side note: Stephen Furst also voiced the role of Booster in the Buzz Lightyear cartoon), Mark Metcalf as Neidermyer, John Vernon as Wormer (he would later voice a similar role in an episode of Billy and Mandy) and of course John Belushi as Bluto.I mean really how can you not love Bluto? Sure he's gross but he's awesome and the way Belushi plays the role is spot on and brilliant. Making excellent use of his eyebrow expressions and non-verbal humor.This movie would later get a spin-off TV series titled Delta House which was short-lived but featured the original cast (except for Belushi of course).Although in the show they do have Bluto's brother Blotto, and Bluto is referenced numerous times in the show.While the show was quite good, the movie it was based off of is and always will be considered a classic campus comedy.If you haven't seen it, it's definitely a must see and one that you must simply watch in order to fully enjoy it.If you want to get it on DVD then get out the Double Secret Probation edition - it's got some great bonus features. Including a Where Are They Now style mockumentary. There are some really annoying ads on it thoug but that shouldn't bother you too much.One little Landis running gag that this movie originated was ""When In Hollywood..Visit Universal Studios (Ask For Babs)"" which appears after the end credits. This refers to the character ""Babs"" a female character who according to the ""Where Are They Now"" segment became a tour-guide.",National Lampoon's Animal House

No teen movie after 1978 has topped it, and I don't think anyone will. The movie contains pretty much the same things that every teen flick does; Sex, party, pranks, harsh adults, and drunk teenagers. The movie is so seriously made though, that these scenes can easily be watched by adults today. I love movies that defies the way it ""should"" be done and instead offers the audience something they have never seen before (star wars, psycho). I'm not comparing John Landis to George Lucas or Hitchcock, but the man has always gone his own way, and together with the funny and talented scriptwriter Harold Ramis, he delivers one of the top ten best comedies ever which shouldn't be missed by no one.Animal house also contains a wonderful soundtrack and some great first time actors; Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Kevin Bacon, Bruce McGuill, and the talented John Belushi (may he rest in peace) as Bluto. And let's not forget Donald Sutherland (one of my favorite actors) who, as far as I know, has never made a bad part.If you haven't seen it, and if you like to laugh, go see it.",National Lampoon's Animal House

172,sullymazda,"In 1978, The Only Guy In The Theater Sitting There Stone Faced",2,28 March 2015,"Saturday Night Live premiered in the fall of 1975. I was born in 1957, so I remember the period well. It was lauded for being ""irreverent"", as if that was something that was still, you know,""anti-establishment"" (whatever the hell that means-it's a badly constructed straw man), and therefore cool in the mid 1970s. It wasn't. What bugged me about the program was that even back then, right there and then on the spot, it was behind the times.The cast looked--and acted--more like a bunch of hippies--each of whom was a manque- doing their bit at some crummy coffeehouse located in The Village in-- at the latest-- 1971. Many things ended the 1960s.""All in the Family"", the overwhelming re- election of Nixon, the blaxploitation films, glitter, etc.The final nail in the coffin was ""The Big D""-Disco. Disco was officially the end of the 60s. I guess by 1975, the ""not Ready For Prime Time Players""-- a dead-on description if there ever was one--still had not seen the writing on the wall, and that hippie protest was giving way to The Hustle,The Bee Gees, and KC and The Sunshine Band. There's a connection between the original ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""National Lampoon's Animal House"". The concept of the film--not to mention its execution--is quite simply not that funny.Going through ninety minutes by being badly behaved Sticking it to The Man. Ruining virtually everything that you touch.And then being rewarded for it. Another reviewer--who did not like the picture--brought up an excellent point when he mentioned the social pressure placed upon you to find the film amusing. You were,indeed,ostracized for claiming that the film left you cold. I realize now what my response should have been, and that was to call these people on it.Yeah. Please identify for us the portions of this motion picture that you found witty and droll. A 13 year old girl being administered alcohol and (implicitly) gang molested? A perfectly harmless animal that winds up dead in the hands of these philistines? Another man--brave enough to serve in Vietnam--killed by his own men? Always tickles my funny bone.

174,bfsr81,The origin of last 3 decades teen comedies,8,18 May 2016,"I watched this movie in 2016 at 34 Years old. If I want to judge it as per today standards I will give it a 5-6/10 because I have watched a lot of similar movies with almost same jokes (We are over saturated with this type of comedy). But when I take into account that this movie was made in 1978 I find it is a masterpiece within its genre as it has influenced a lot of following movies with which I have laughed on scenes that already existed in Animal house.In 2016, I laughed 4 times watching it with extraordinary scenes such as the horse, cucumber & Belushi and the pencils. I found a lot of other scenes not funny nowadays simply because I have already seen them in last 3 decades films, but i have to recognize that they made me laugh in the newest films which means that watching this film in 1978 would have been extraordinary funny with at at least 20-30 high laughing moments, below are several examples: - Virginity issues (American pie) - Taking advantage of a novice colleague using his car (road trip) - Bad student humor (Accepted) - Colleges competition (Up the creek) - Sex with an underage , or getting sleep when doing sex (Trainspotting) - Taking advantage of death for sex (wedding crushers) - 50's sensual taboos issue (Back to the future) - White guys in a club for Afro Americans, weed, alcohol .... (Several movies) As we can check, we have laughed in a lot of movies with scenes created originally in Animal House. We need to consider also that there are several scenes normal/not funny nowadays (Like The teenager with the playboy magazine, girls in underwear and half naked playing with pillows, a bra filled with paper ,having weed with a prof. ...etc.) but I in 1978 when released or in the 50s where the story is taking place these scenes were top of the cream and a cultural shock in the movies industries breaking a lot of existing barriers which made it stimulating at the time this movie was released.As a result this is a great movie, probably the best in its genre. I give it only an 8 because teen comedies are not within my favorite genres and because it is very related to the American pop/culture which is not mine, but thanks to this movie I can strongly criticize new movies in this genre because they are simply copying this great classic in teen comedy.",National Lampoon's Animal House

176,OregonTraveler,Fiction that resembled fact,9,21 January 2009,"Since the movie ended up being filmed in Eugene at a Delta fraternity house, the setting and the events came remarkably close to my experience at a ""Delta ___ _____"" house on the same campus in the mid-1960's. Even D-Day's motorcycle's trip up the staircase was a dead ringer for Brillo Pad's similar feat. The probation, flying beer bottles, toga parties, and general laissez-faire attitude about everything matched the script. On one occasion, the Eugene Police Department was called to break up a ""little disturbance"" on the front lawn only to have one of the two squad cars have its keys taken during the time that the police were ""policing."" After searching the lawn with their flashlights, both officers piled into the second car to return to the station to get a second set of keys for the car. After they left, one of our brothers pulled out the keys from his pocket and said, ""Look what I found."" He and a buddy drove the car through the campus with the lights flashing and the siren blaring while trying to set a new speed record. They took the car to the police station to report that they had found the keys ""in the grass"" but were nearly arrested for unauthorized use of an emergency vehicle. I saw Animal House when it was first released and I was in shock with the many similarities of the movie script to my own experiences. I called my frat roommate and when he answered I said in a somewhat quivering voice, ""Larry."" Before I could say another word, he recognized my voice and answered, ""You just saw Animal House, didn't you!?"" The epilogue of the movie was humorous as it described what happened to the characters in subsequent years.

I wondered how the film-makers would elaborate on a short comic book entry to make a feature length film? The answer was that they would expand the satiric brevity of the original written piece into an overblown gross-fest of unrestrained gags that gagged, and unrestrained actors (Belushi in particular) whose mannerisms and actions totally disconnected with what I would find humorous. It may be that I have a problem with my sense of humor, but, found myself embarrassed by the activities on-screen, and insulted by the film-makers that they would think that this was entertaining. When the boys left the (under-aged, drunk, and date-raped) girl in the grocery cart, framed exactly as I remember the comic strip drawn, I had had enough and left the theater. My teenage sons rented this one recently, and I tried again to watch it, but found that I could tolerate it even less now than I could when I was a sophomore with a sophomoric sense of humor. 0 out 10...my most hated film of all time.",National Lampoon's Animal House

184,fireflame94,"This is simply terrible, like every comedy time has not treated it well",3,10 August 2009,"This film may have been a true classic in the late 70's when it was made but comedy is very fickle and what was funny then is seldom funny now. What was considered distasteful, grotesque or disturbing but funny back in those days now seems very cheesy and distinctly unfunny as the comedies of today have raised the bar far beyond Animal House.The problem with this movie is that every scene is either not acted enough or far over-acted by John Belushi. These problems still are in today's movies but this was a successful movie while those with similarly poor acting and cheesy portrayals of college life languish with straight-to-DVD releases and are considered poor by all.This may have started the sex-comedies of today but as I said earlier time has not treated it well as almost every comedy with this sort of premise really requires knowledge of the time it is set in, which I did not have. Admittedly, though that may of helped me find some scenes funny, the acting in this film made lines that should of worked not work and the movie almost screams for a laugh track as it would be appropriate, given the wooden dialogue and sitcom-like over-acting and premises.Time has moved on and good comedies of today are in a far superior league not just because of the acting shown but because they either choose to embrace the cheesiness or wackiness of their story and do things that people in the 70's wouldn't imagine seeing at M and R16 comedies, which Animal House tries to do but fails as the wacky, disturbing stuff was done far more tastefully.Other comedies focus on realism and are funny because you can imagine yourself in a situation not too far away from the one the characters find themselves in and the jokes they make are a lot like the ones you and your friends make.In short, Animal House may have been revolutionary in the 70's but an audience watching it today would expect far more from a movie so highly acclaimed.

Beloved of people who like to roar laughing but detested by high-minded and humorless moralists, ""Animal House"" has been consistently under-rated by the critics (Leonard Maltin gives it two stars out of four, as I remember -- an outrageous assessment).

Belushi gives a near silent pitch perfect performance as the slob ""Bluto"". This is John Landis at his directorial peak, he also directed the fine ""Kentucky Fried Movie,"" ""Blues Brothers"", ""Trading Places"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"". But after that he really tanked, not since Peter Bogdanovich has a director created such a fine body of work, only to be followed by worthless crap. But I digress! National Lampoon's Animal House has an engaging story, characters and cast. Tim Matheson also gives his best performance as the confident frat leader ""Otter"" (the date with Fran Liebowitz is classic). Along with ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""What's Up Doc"", one of the greatest comedies of the 70's.",National Lampoon's Animal House
192,celebrity_lover,Entertaining movie for older teens and adults,7,18 November 2015,"This movie is a raunchy comedy. It has lots lots of naked women and sexual content. This is a good movie for 16-17+. If your that age or older you will enjoy this movie. But beware that even some adults may find it too inappropriate. It is quite raunchy. This one of the oldest National Lampoon movies. It's one of the raunchiest movies of the 70s. Note that this is not a movie that you want collage trouble students to watch. This movie is about collage students that drink, have sex and strip. I like it, I just saw it for the very first time. I think it's funny. This is better then some raunchy comedies that I have seen. This not to strong in sexual content but has lots of nudity so I would not recommend watching it if you can't handle raunchy movies.",National Lampoon's Animal House

It's subversive, funny and has a great soundtrack.  The trailer was funny and everyone I know wants to see it.  Problem, the film is restricted, we are all underage, and there is no-way one of our parents would 'accompany' us to the movie.So, me and a couple of pals sneak to the theater, and sneak in - and are treated to an amazing film.Now although seamingly dated with the yearly barrage of teenager aimed 'coming of age' picks it is hard to remember that in 1978 this film was new. It was the original that set the tone for the barrage of immitators that followed.  It is also note remembering that this film was not aimed at teenagers, rather at young adults.  The comedy and situations were original, adult in tone and they deliver.Belushi - in his second motion picture and at his prime, Ramis with his first screenplay, and Landis - only his third time at the helm, deliver.The rest of the - relatively - unknown cast are fresh and deliver.All in all a great film, and worth watching again - not the butchered for TV versions, but if possible in a repretory theater or on DVD.",National Lampoon's Animal House

199,mattrocks85,"A Picture Perfect Shot of ""The Days We Knew""",10,27 January 2011,"Being that this is my first review as a user to this site, I figured it best to review what is probably my all-time favorite movie - Animal House.Everyone knows what the movie is about even if they've never seen but the great thing about it is that it's actually a well-made movie from even the harshest critic's point of view. Aside from a slew of great directorial aspects, quite possibly the best aspect of this movie is the character development. Each main character is treated with such a fine eye. You get to really know these characters and even feel a sense of ""I know that guy"" from a lot of them. Each character is uniquely their own person and work so well together. The movie makes you believe that this fraternity can (and trust me, does) exist. This movie sums up my life in college and probably countless others across the nation.That is probably the best quality of the movie; as crazy as some of the stuff that happens is and as wild as the characters are, it's still believable! And the reason it is rests with the outstanding cast of characters. They're real! Other movies have tried to recreate the magic of this movie and have failed simply because their characters and the situations they've been thrown into aren't too believable (a la Van Wilder - that movie is hysterical though).All in all - make sure you take a second look at Animal House and appreciate everything that this movie is. It basically defined my generation...and I was negative 7 years old when it came out! 10 out of 10.",National Lampoon's Animal House

There is not much material for women, but it still should be viewed by female movie buffs. I don't need to explain the plot because it doesn't really matter, it's a movie that is not to be taken seriously or to be nominated for academy awards,it's just pure fun.

Is it a perfect movie? Nope, and that is why I only gave it a 7 out of 10. But it ranks up there at the top of one of the funniest movies out there, at least in my book, John Landis had to be pinching himself at times to be the director of this mess, I mean film. Especially once the movie turns to the poor town trying to have a respectable parade, total bedlam ensues. Stuff is going nuts, and there is just no telling what is going to happen next.

202,gkrupa73,"Funny FIlm, Hardly a Classic.",6,14 January 2005,"I loved Animal House. I still do. It is far more comical then banal nonsense like like Seinfeld, that ignoramus Jim Carry, or whoever that jerk is who made those Spy Shagging things (whatever that losers name is). They may have made money-but not comedy. I would go so far as to say that a good fun comedy has not been made in 25 years. As such, I pity the younger film goers. What do they have to compare current comedies to? Generational arrogance and narcissism will not allow them to watch a film made at an earlier time-God forbid-and they must watch what their peers tell them to (Far be it have an original mind!). So, I loved Animal House simply because it is a comedy that is funny. You cannot have a comedy about nothing and enjoy it unless you have nothing inside. Animal House follows the rules. You have well defined characters who successfully engage in comical acts and get involved in comical events. They are funny because you know who the characters are and can relate them to the events and their own comical actions have reason, logical direction and are therefore funny. So, when Blutto gets a ladder and peeps into the girl's dormitory, we laugh not because he may be exploiting the girls (I figure someone is going to address that subject that way so I might as well do it first)or that we are exploiting them- laugh because by the time Blutto does this, we expect him to do something like this, we recognize this and we laugh. Thus, Animal House is a well made comedy that follows the rules of comedy in a contemporary sea of films made by people who are passed off as comedy makers but who are as funny as foot fungus. In that context, how could it seem to so many be as anything other but a ""classic""?",National Lampoon's Animal House

And what can one say about Otis Day and the Knights.... a true one hit (?) wonder but so typical of many of the rock n' roll groups of that era. Time warps all memories but Animal House relishes on making many of our own memories larger than life.

212,pendragon679,This one gets a 4.0 for sure!,10,1 May 2004,"John Landis's directorial debut, and John Belushi's first starring role make this screw-ball comedy about college life in the early 60's a must-see.  I saw this picture for the first time when it was released to theaters and laughed my buns off; it still holds up today, almost 30 years later.Every actor in the show gives a bravura performance, with stand-out debuts by the likes of Thomas Hulce, Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Bruce Davidson, and others.  In addition, there's a sense throughout the picture that we all knew these guys at one time or another in our lives.  Shoot, I think I may have BEEN one or two of these guys at some point in my life.  Of course, the picture revolves around Belushi's terrifically over-the-top Bluto Blutarsky; but you simply can't ignore characters like Boone, Otter, Niedermeyer, Gregg Marmalade, and my personal favorite, D-Day.The writing on this picture is really far better than the loosely-structured plot first indicates.  Each character is introduced neatly at their entrance; and, by extension, the other characters are set up by the entrances of their surrounding characters.  For instance, when we first meet Belushi's character, he's holding a schooner of beer in one hand and drunkenly taking a leak on the Delta Tau Chi lawn.  Right away, we know what the rest of these guys are going to be like.  Then, when D-Day makes his entrance, driving his hawg through the front door and up the stairs to play the William Tell Overture on his throat before pulling a beer out of his jacket and popping the top, our fears are confirmed.  Meanwhile, we get to meet the uptight, repressed, and mildly facsist other frat through similar vignettes.  Kevin Bacon is particularly hilarious in his initiation (""Thank you, sir! May I have another?"").John Landis made his debut with this picture, and what a debut it was! His camera follows each of the characters and events at near breakneck speed, giving the audience little time to recover from one laugh before getting slapped in the head with another.  Lots of natural lighting, and sharp, steady pacing with smooth transitions keep the story moving. Refreshingly, the film doesn't rely on over-the-top special effects to hold our attention. Then again, is there really any place for SFX in a picture like this?
The whole picture is one long laugh, from beginning to end.  If you're a college grad, you'll forget what it was really like to have to work hard, study, and generally bust your tail to graduate.  If you haven't yet gone to college, this picture will give you all the wrong ideas.  On the other hand, you've gotta see this one, if for no other reason than to learn all the right (and wrong) things to do at a college party.",National Lampoon's Animal House

But its true enjoyment lies in remembering what that time period was about, and appreciating the funny pokes at then-society's crumbling institutions: the ""outcasts room"" at rush early in the film, the oh-so-sweet, yet latexed-gloved sorority girls, brown-nosing ""good-guys"",etc. I can't help but think that today's younger generations just ""won't get it"".....they didn't live the '60s, and by virtue of political correctness have never been allowed to laugh at many of the jokes here!",National Lampoon's Animal House

My first tweet was ""12 minutes in. Not laughed once yet. Should I have?"" I mention laughing – I mean internal laughter too. I hadn't identified a joke, or a comedy situation by that point. Of course, I then identified that certain other things had been referencing this film – most notably an episode of Futurama called ""robot house"" when Bender enrolls in Mars University. One of the robots spends the whole time in a little beanie hat, which now becomes funnier, as I have now seen the reference material (I laughed a lot after first seeing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as it made the Simpsons so much funnier.) Next tweet, after the Futurama reference, was ""36 minutes, I sort of smirked"". I have no idea what I smirked at. Following this – ""This film is so bad, I've stopped forward winding the adverts""I suspect this was the first film to dare to show pretty girls with their tops off. However – the accessibility of boobs is now so easy, my standards are considerably higher. My tweet that the ""topless pillow fight would have been better if they weren't all wearing MASSIVE granny pants"" made me realize that this is something that would have been cutting edge in 1978. I went a little controversial on my next one. ""Belushi. Only remembered as good because he died early? With him on the guitar smashing at parties though"". Everyone who has ever been jealous of the smarmy bloke who plays the guitar and has the girls cooing on his every note has wanted to do that. Otherwise, he is playing quite the most charmless and one dimensional character I've ever seen in cinema. Deeply unpleasant and unlikable. Anyone whose party trick is crushing a can on his own forehead gets no sympathy from me.I found myself entirely sympathizing with the group of new kids – who have somehow made it to college (later I discover this is the only reason they aren't being drafted to fight in the Vietnam war, which I can sympathize with, but if going to college is the only way you are going to avoid getting killed in a ludicrous conflict, then surely you'd do all you can to stay there), they are searching for acceptance, friendship and like minded people. Unfortunately for them, they apparently only have two choices – the posh, rich and intelligent kids, or the complete brain dead losers. There was apparently no third choice. The posh kids wouldn't have them, and the losers couldn't care less, so the join Delta House, who are already on ""double secret probation"" (what the hell is that – how are you supposed to know you are in trouble if you aren't told about it?) After various illegal activities, underage drinking, underage sex, hints at date rape (we believe his conscience got the better of him) horse murder, in addition to academic issues, such as NOT GOING TO ANY CLASSES or having grade point averages of less than zero, they seem somewhat surprised and shocked when they are expelled.I did identify a few attempts at humor in the process:  The inability to open a bra strap has now become such a cliché – and I know it wasn't a new joke when this film used it – that it is purely not funny.  The moment when Belushi's character puts pencils up his nose while in the Dean's office might have been funny, if he'd removed them on replacement of the Dean's glasses – although maybe the fact that I was expecting that to happen makes it funnier, although not that much funnier.  Sex with 13 year old girls isn't funny either.  Blatant racism in having a bunch of white kids walk into a bar full of black people, and immediately get threatened with flick-knives, - is that funny because my preconceptions are that this really isn't realistic behavior? The closest thing for me to an actual comedy moment, was when the house was being emptied and a cow was led down the front steps.In protest at their expulsion, our (anti?)heroes decide to get their revenge, ruining the homecoming parade, an event that the good people of the town were very much enjoying, they assault, molest and pretty much attempted murder their way to notoriety, finishing off with driving their ""death wagon"" or some such into the platform holding the Dean and his wife. How am I supposed to have any sympathy for people who have no idea that they are in control of their own destinies, that they are guilty of all the charges against them, and completely deserved everything that happened to them? If there was any sense of injustice against Delta House, it might have been a different matter, but these idiots did themselves no favors at all.31 years have not been kind to Animal House. I grew up with Alison Hannigan doing things with her flute in American pie. With Terrence and Philip singing about inappropriate relationships with their uncles in South Park the Movie. Having your trousers urinated on by a drunken lout (and accepting it) is gross, but not funny. Humour has moved on, and maybe going back in time to where it all started was never going to work for me.",National Lampoon's Animal House

229,corynye,"The Unofficial ""College Movie""!",8,30 September 2000,"If you are in college, see this movie!  Immediately.  Don't take anything too seriously - just sit back, grab a brew and watch the members of the Delta fraternity raise hell at Faber College.Here's the lowdown: the Delta House is the most disgusting, riotous, loudest frat house on campus, and Dean Wormer is considering disbanding the frat and kicking all of its members off campus.  The plot also features a rival frat full of stuck-up, preppy frat boys whose intentions are to do whatever they can to ensure that the Delta members will be kicked off school grounds for their inappropriate conduct.  Among the Delta House's offenses: killing a horse in the Dean's office, cheating on exams, plenty of under-age drinking, multiple incidents of property damage and many more ridiculous stunts.  On top of this, one of the fraternity's members gets romantically involved with a 13 year-old girl that looks 18 and the president of the fraternity actually manages to score sexual intercourse from the Dean's wife!
John Belushi made himself a legend in this slap-in-the-face to traditional film-making.  He plays the part of Bluto, an out-of-control student who leads his frat brothers through a series of childish pranks that upset the Dean and even the Mayor of the city of Faber.  Bluto is every party-goer's hero with his ""carpe diem"" attitude to life and his ability to down an entire bottle of whiskey in the span of about 10 seconds, not to mention his ability to devour a good portion of the college's mess hall menu!  On top of this, he registered a 0.0 GPA...impressive, eh?  This is a MUST SEE for any college student who likes to kick back a few brewskis and party-hop on the weekends.  It also features a good share of T&A for male viewers, so you really can't go wrong.  Animal House is also really clever with stereotypes and never fails to draw a laugh.Again, don't take this movie too seriously.

Even though this movie has had 32 years of college movies following it, none of them have been able to show the greatness from the original genius behind Animal House. The fact is, that none of the movies today achieve the greatness that this movie has. Most people my age (teenagers) usually like to hang around the new material and do not have any such intellectual curiosity that would lead to discovering the classics. People take too much interest in stupid movies to realize that there simply are better movies around. It's almost sad that no one appreciates movies from the 70s, because that's where the true genius behind college films is it - Animal House. It is, has been, and always will be the best frat movie, period.",National Lampoon's Animal House

Still, I was amazed. The charisma that this 70s classic has probably comes from being those ""American Pie"" kind of movies only that seems to be more legendary. And about the comedy, well, this is the comedy I love to see, not only action comedy that seems incredibly silly, but also a smart one. And what else can I say? That John Belushi is just astonishing and was an incredibke actir.

I probably wouldn't want to watch this again unless I was very drunk. For a hilarious take on American college life I suggest you watch The Simpsons episode 'Homer Goes To College', which despite being only a fraction of the length of this film, has about 500 times more laughs.",National Lampoon's Animal House

All college or university students should see this movie. I'm still pretty young and I get all of the jokes in this movie. The movie doesn't really have a storyline except it's about a frat house named Delta who are about to be kicked out Faber College by a Dean named Vernon Wormer.

Just plain hilarious, about fell over a few times. I am kind of odd and love the golf scene, and so much of it reminds me of real times in college. Shows fraternities are usually there just for fun. The Omegas are funny as well, the initiation is pretty darn good. Delta - get drunk and have fun. Omega - show who is in charge by making some submit to degradation. Just about right.

The thought of bringing in new actors (Kevin Bacon) to play the role as college kids in the movie was really smart of John Landis, the director. John Landis also did a great job bringing in John Belushi to play the greatest character in Animal House. ""I'm a zit. Get it?"" was in my opinion, the best quote in the whole movie. What is also interesting about the movie Animal House is the storyline of how a college campus actually was. It is the best movie for college kids, mainly because its really funny.

The late, great John Belushi is absolutely outstanding, Donald Sutherland makes an appearance, and Kevin Bacon's ""Thank you sir may I have another?"" line is an instant classic. If you liked movies like ""Old School"" then you should definitely see this. Without spoiling anything I can tell you that this is one of the funniest movies ever made.

It was interesting only as a reference point to the sensibilities of an earlier age. Since Animal House was apparently considered in 1978 to be the height of wit and daring, and since today in comparison with what might be called its pop culture progeny it appears either embarrassingly tame or lame, we can tell just how much the popular culture has evolved in the intervening time. There has been a sea change in received notions of what is cool since 1978, probably comparable to the change in such perceptions during the similar length of time between 1951 and 1978. In other words, its overtly anti-establishment themes and primitive ideas of transgressive humor make Animal House very much a product of its time. This movie can really only be appreciated as a poorly-acted and amateurishly-directed glimpse into the mindset of youngish Americans of another age. I know I'm ragging on this movie, but the humor in Animal House just doesn't translate into today's world, and on balance that is probably something for which we should be grateful.",National Lampoon's Animal House
