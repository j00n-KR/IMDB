0,MartinHafer,"Of all the Pixar movies, this is among the very best",9,10 June 2007,"Aside from TOY STORY II (which I loved), this might just be the best film Pixar has released. It's a really close race between it and THE INCREDIBLES for second best. And considering how wonderful their movies are, this isn't a bad place to finish. Unfortunately for the good folks at Disney, MONSTERS, INC. could not have come out at a worse time. Just days after its release, the even better and more timeless SHREK was released--thereby stealing MONSTERS, INC's thunder and resulting in its just being lost in the shuffle. It's a real shame, though, as this is a wonderful film from start to finish. The voices of the characters were great, computer animation tops and the story line, though silly, worked. But for me, the biggest surprise was that as a jaded adult and very critical person, I loved the cutesy addition to Baby Boo to the film. She was, without a doubt, the cutest thing I have ever seen but also was not gratuitously cute or nauseatingly cute. She was just a perfect addition to an otherwise great film. If you haven't seen this film, get off you behind and see it--it's great stuff and kids as well as adults will love this film.","Monsters, Inc."
1,TheLittleSongbird,Definitely one of the best films of 2001!,9,16 June 2009,"This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.","Monsters, Inc."
2,SnoopyStyle,Less than Toy Story Better than Most,7,27 October 2013,"Monsters generate energy by scaring kids. That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet.","Monsters, Inc."
3,Hitchcoc,Very Creative,9,28 November 2001,"I had heard a lot about this before I went (which I hate), but it was still a pleasant surprise. What I loved was the workaday world of the monsters with their factory, their doors, their business, so like the corporate life of the non-monster world. The character's have gentleness, commitment, and a positive view of the world. While some of it is scary (the whole premise of monsters in the closet is scary anyway), it walks a nice line between being too saccharine and too violent. There are some great lines, and the imaginative world created and based on the scream/energy concept is quite clever. For those that take three year olds to movies, I don't know many that don't have something that would upset someone this age. This film is about monsters. They can't be too tame or they will lose their monsterness.While there are harsh things, the closing scene is done with great sympathy and on terms that we can all live with. It is also about risk taking to do the right thing. This is not Citizen Kane but it sure ain't bad.","Monsters, Inc."
4,Horst_In_Translation,Pixar creates exciting parallel world for children and grown-ups,8,18 October 2013,"A world full of monsters that just got expanded with a sequel not too long ago. And the introduction to this world was the best thing about this film. One of the finest efforts in the Pixar universe. The idea of children as energy sources is the core of the film and possibly the main reason why it succeeds so impressively. The doors as means of transit from the monster world into the human world. The simulators where the not so experienced monsters can improve their abilities. It all oozes creativity. Another strength of this film is that its supporting characters are at least as interesting as the two monsters in the lead. I don't think we need to talk about Mike and Sully much. Their actions and presence speak for themselves. One is huge, furry and truly scary, yet kind-hearted, the other is tiny, slippery (at least that's what he looks like, like a frog), always funny and obviously a bit of a womanizer. And yet, they're best friends. Beyond these two, the monster world includes creatures of all sizes, shapes and colors, so they're a feast visually, but with some the writers also succeeded to make them truly entertaining and effective. The two antagonists are really a scary presence, thanks to their looks with all those tentacles for example on Coburn's character or their ability to turn invisible (Buscemi). Two more I liked: One would be Mike's girlfriend who gave me a true LOL moment when she talks during the date about how she may be interested in a shorter haircut and we see those snakes that actually are her hair go into full panic mode for a moment. The other is the poor Monster Inc. worker who got showered and sheared when they discover a baby sock on his back. His reaction when there is one on his back again later into the film was pretty hilarious. Well done. The exterminators were pretty hilarious too, even if you didn't see any physical trademarks on them as they were all covered by their huge uniforms. There's just so many great characters and I'm certainly forgetting some. Already all those they see when they go to work. Thankfully Sully kept Mike from taking the car, otherwise we would have missed all of these.When the whole part of introducing us to the monster world ends and the real story starts with the little girl entering the picture, it gets slightly worse, but only because it was so great before. Boo is still the cutest thing ever (gotta love how she keeps saying Mike's name) and the way Sully slowly grows paternal feelings for her is displayed with lots of heart. Afterwards we see the usual ingredients, the villains seemingly gaining the upper hand, characters being exposed as surprisingly good or evil, the main characters' friendships being put to the test, Sully to Boo and Sully to Mike etc. The latter actually happens in the Himalayas and features a funny cameo of the Abominable Snowman and his snow cones. The only thing from the film which did not really interest me, was the action sequence and all the main characters riding on the doors on their fight for little Boo. That felt really only for children in the audience again. I won't complain though as not only the way the two villains got it in the end (crocodile reference, simulator exposure) and the twist of turning the scream factory into a laughter factory were very well-made again and the epilogue with Mike having built the door to Boo fully together will hopefully give you an equally warm feeling in your chest as it did for me. ""Boo?"" ""Kitty!"" with the huge smile entering Sully's face was truly a perfect way to end the movie. Easily among Pixar's best and very much recommended for people all ages.","Monsters, Inc."
5,kosmasp,Wanna see something really ... not so scary?,8,31 August 2013,"Trust in Pixar when it comes to kids movies with unconventional stories behind them. Who'd have thought that a movie about Monsters could be kid friendly? Pixar apparently and it does work quite well. I haven't watched the recently (conviniently released just before the sequel hit the cinema screens) re-vamped 3D version of the movie, but I'm pretty sure they did a good job on that too.Whatever that looks like, I can attest that the ""normal"" 2D version does look great. But it's obviously the movie that counts and that is a good one too. Not so much relying on Minions or other sidekicks, this based on the friendship of two Monsters. A really good movie both for the older and younger Pixar fans.","Monsters, Inc."
6,classicsoncall,"""Hey, may the best monster win!""",8,12 November 2011,"When I was a kid, the monster I feared wasn't under the bed or in the closet. It was at the top of the attic stairs, and I'll let you in on a little secret. It was a giant gorilla. I just knew it was there, but I would gird myself to go up to prove I could overcome my fear. Once there, I would tempt fate by rotating the hand on an old clock my grandmother had stored up there, and it would bong out it's forbidding chime. Let me tell you, for an eight year old, it was SCARY.Anyway, I'm writing this review some fifty or so years later, so I got beyond the scary part. But you know, I still think about it whenever I'm at my folks' house and go up those daunting stairs. I move around pretty freely now and that old clock is gone, so I'm no longer petrified. Lending some credence to the central theme of this picture, I watched it today with my three year old granddaughter, and you know, in some cases it might be true - ""There is nothing more deadly or toxic than a human child"". But not my granddaughter, she's just a sweet kid. And she liked the movie. So that's good enough for me.Of course, watching the movie with a kid has it's distractions, so I may have missed a few things. But I'll tell you what, I got the biggest kick out of the yellow snow cone reference and the HAZMAT team going by the CDA (Child Detection Agency) that came in to sanitize poor George who got a kid's sock stuck to his fur. Quite coincidentally, the film I watched just before this one was ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"", so the appearance of one Mr. Waternoose was more than serendipitous. There were other good bits too, like the nod to Ray Harryhausen and the idea of matching every kid with their ideal monster. I guess for me that would be King Kong. Go figure.","Monsters, Inc."
7,gavin6942,Lots of Fun From Pixar,7,13 January 2015,"Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, top scarer Sulley (John Goodman) finds his world disrupted.With the additional voices of Steve Buscemi and John Ratzenberger (as the Agreeable Snowman), this is a great story of monsters in the closet... turned upside down. In this version, monsters only scare children because it generates electricity, and the monsters actually fear children, believing them to be toxic.Of Pixar's films, this is definitely one of the more iconic and memorable, right up there with ""Toy Story"". As of now (2015), there has been one sequel, but do not be surprised if at least one more comes along.","Monsters, Inc."
8,lee_eisenberg,I loved this movie...and I don't even like Disney.,10,28 September 2005,"One of the ways that I rank a really good movie is one that gives us a new perspective on our own world. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one such movie. Set in Monstropolis, the movie shows that monsters are in fact not much different from humans. The two main monsters are one-eyed, diminutive Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and furry behemoth James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman). They work at Monsters, Incorporated, where everyone's job is to go into children's bedrooms, roar at them, and record the screams - which they use to power the city. When a little girl accidentally gets into Monstropolis, they not only have to do everything possible to hide her from the authorities, but they discover a bizarre conspiracy.One of this movie's most interesting aspects was it's timing. Released less than two months after September 11, 2001, it was sort of reminding us that human nature is in fact good - even if they had to use monsters to show it. Also, the scene where a monster walks back into the factory with a sock apparently reminded some people of the anthrax attacks. Oh well. Life goes on. With some absolutely hilarious lines, ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the best examples of a movie. I'm even someone who doesn't like Disney and I'm saying this.","Monsters, Inc."
9,jboothmillard,"Monsters, Inc.",10,14 September 2005,"If you like the first three or four CGI computer animated films by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar, then this is the next of the films. As a kid you obviously believed there were monsters hiding in your closets waiting to scare you, well in this, they only do it because it is their jobs. The film mainly focuses on one of the best scaring monsters and his best friend. John Goodman as James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski are just the perfect characters for this film. Basically a door (used to get to the closet of kids) is left behind, so that Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) could cheat and become best monster. Anyway, out of the door comes a little human girl, and Sulley is nearly caught hiding her. He now has to get back to Monsters, Inc. Without anyone spotting the kid. Also starring James Coburn as Henry J. Waternoose III, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as The Abominable Snowman and Frank Oz as Fungus. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Randy Newman, and it was nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Music, Original Score for Randy Newman, and Best Sound Editing, and it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. It was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 53 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!","Monsters, Inc."
10,ccthemovieman-1,Nothing To Criticize Here - Very Solid Animated Film,9,10 July 2006,"This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too. Kids will love it, I am sure. The ""monsters"" in here are funny-looking and almost lovable, nothing that would scare your kids (or you). Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy. There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too.","Monsters, Inc."
11,Tweekums,Another delightful film from Pixar,9,24 September 2012,"James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and his friend Mike Wazowski work for 'Monsters Incorporated; the company that provides power in the city of Monstropolis like everybody else in the city they are monsters; Sulley is a blue bear like creature and Mike is a green ball on legs with one huge eye. To generate the power monsters go through doors that act like portals to the human world and scare children; the problem is children scare as easily as they used to. It isn't considered a safe job either; the monsters believe that if the child touches them they will die and any item accidentally brought back much be vigorously decontaminated; along with the monster who brought it back. Sulley is the champion scarer although his rival Randall Boggs isn't far behind. Randall has a plan to revolutionise the scaring process, when Sulley stumbles upon this scheme he accidentally releases a two year old human child into Monstropolis when she is spotted it causes a city wide panic. Sulley and Mike sneak her back into work but getting her home will be quite and adventure!This Pixar film was a delight from start to finish; Sulley and Mike were great protagonists, Randall was a suitable slimy villain and the girl, who Sulley dubbed Boo, was really cute. The animation was up to Pixar's usual high standards; the hair on Sulley looked almost real and the chase sequence towards the end looked great; it gave a real sense of motion even on a small screen! The voices are provided by top Hollywood stars including John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly; all of whom demonstrate they can do voice acting just as well as they can do live action. The story was simple enough for young children to follow but enjoyable enough for their parents and adults who in touch with their inner child to enjoy. There are lots of laughs and just the right number of mild scares. I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to anybody looking for a fun film that is suitable for all ages.","Monsters, Inc."
12,moonspinner55,Shriek Business...,6,27 June 2010,"Furry and scaly creatures from Monstropolis, a city powered by the screams of terrified children, attempt to nab a carefree youngster who has infiltrated the factory, taking an instant liking to amiable partners-in-fear ""Sulley"" Sullivan (a gorilla-sized daddy with blue fur) and Mike Wazowski (a one-eyed, dodge-ball-shaped wisecracker). Another hectic bit of computer-animated whimsy from Disney/Pixar takes a while to get its story ironed out, though the plot culminates wonderfully in a brilliantly-designed chase sequence. Long at 92 minutes, and perhaps too sticky with sentiment, but children probably won't mind. The star-voices run hot and cold, and the movie in-jokes aren't pointed enough to hit home, but there's a lot of color and imagination here. High-spirited family fun. **1/2 from ****","Monsters, Inc."
13,Quinoa1984,Entertaining and imaginative 4th film from Pixar,7,2 November 2001,"Monsters Inc., another fine animated movie from the folks at Pixar takes a turn from toys and bugs and goes for something most kids and adults can identify with (adults may have to reach back in time though for that one), being afraid of what's behind the closet at night.  It turns out, in this film, that monsters do lurk behind the closet, and they scare kids as a power resource to give electricity to Monstropolis where the monsters live. 2 of the scarers include Sully (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), who have it good in their job until a mishap occurs- a little child crawls through to the other side and creates a different type of adventure for the two monsters.Incredibly imaginative and colorful computer-animated, Moster Inc. is definitely one of the best family films of the year by giving genuine entertainment to kids and adults (an added incentive for adults to see the movie: Crystal does a little of his old stand-up near the end) just like the past pixar movies.  The biggest liability: the plot seems structured in the same way as Bug's Life and the Toy Story pics and seems typical for the genre.  Otherwise, quite the see.  Other voices include James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, Bonnie Hunt and Frank Oz. A-","Monsters, Inc."
14,michaelRokeefe,There is a scream to catch behind every door.,6,8 March 2003,"This has to be good, because it comes from the people that gave us TOY STORY(1995). Very good animated flick for the whole family. A little girl accidentally enters Monsteropolis where she befriends two hapless characters/creatures who work at a ""scare"" factory that is in the business of capturing children's screams. Great F/X. My favorite scene is the snow storm. Lending voices to motivate these characters:Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Mary Gibbs, Steve Buscemy, John Ratzenberger and James Coburn. Enjoyable for all ages.","Monsters, Inc."
15,sunwarrior13,Charming Cartoon Classic,10,21 October 2012,"After exploring the worlds of toys and bugs in the two Toy Story films and A Bug's Life, the award-winning computer animation company Pixar delves into the realm of monsters with its fourth feature entitled,Monster Inc.This computer-animated comedy-adventure film is directed by Pete Docter, released by Walt Disney Pictures, and the fourth film produced by Pixar Animation Studios. Co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, it stars two monsters who work for a company named Monsters, Inc.: top scarer James P. Sullivan or Sulle,voiced by John Goodman and his one-eyed assistant, Mike Wazowski,voiced by Billy Crystal.Other voice overs is provided by Mary Gibbs,Steve Buscemi,James Coburn,Jennifer Tilly and Frank Oz.Monsters generate their city's power by scaring children, but they are terribly afraid themselves of being contaminated by children, so when one enters Monstropolis, Sulley finds his world disrupted.Hulking, blue-furred behemoth Sully and his one-eyed assistant Mike Wazowski are employed by Monsters, Inc., a scream processing factory. It seems that the denizens of their realm thrive on the screams of kids spooked by monsters lurking under their beds and in their closets. It's the job of Sully, Mike, and their co-workers, including sarcastic Randall Boggs, crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose, and lovely snake- headed receptionist Celia to keep the frights flowing. When Sully and Mike are followed back into the monster world by a very unafraid little human girl named Boo, they are exiled to her universe, where they discover that such a modern-day mythological specimen as the Abominable Snowman is a fellow refugee.Even though Monsters, Inc lacks the sophistication of the Toy Story series, it is a still delight for children of all ages due to the fact that John Lasseter and the Pixar crew know how to turn shared human feelings and experiences into strange and delightful animated features.No doubt that this is one of their most solid efforts.Aside from that,it is a charming cartoon classic.","Monsters, Inc."
16,studioAT,Pixar at it's best,8,28 June 2011,Now i'm a big fan anything that Pixar produces and they rightly deserve all the praise they get because they are pure storytellers of the highest quality and this film is one of the best.The story is simple and told beautifully combining strong voice talent such as Billy Crystal and John Goodman with great visual imagery and animation. Only Pixar can tell a story about monsters from our closets in the way that they can and make the characters to endearing that we care for them.The sweet little Boo steals the show and Pixar tell her story with such heart that is rarely found in the films of companies like Blue Sky.This film fits well into not only the impressive body of work of Pixar but also Disney and is well deserved of it's place alongside other great works such as Snow White and Lion King.,"Monsters, Inc."
17,preppy-3,Cute and funny,9,13 November 2001,"Computer animated movie about the monsters in our closet from our childhood. It seems they exist in a place called Monsteropolis and collect the screams of children they frighten to power their city.  Then an adorable little girl accidentally on purpose gets into their world, attaches herself to furry cuddly Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and all heck breaks loose.  This isn't as funny as ""Toy Story 1"" or ""2"" but what is?  The animation is superb, it's never boring, there are some very funny bits for kids and adults and there's a wizz bang climax where good vs. evil that is just fantastic.  Well worth seeing.","Monsters, Inc."
18,poolandrews,"""Today is bring an obscure relative to work day."" Just about flawless animated comedy fantasy.",9,25 December 2006,"Monsters, Inc. starts like any other day in Monstropolis for monster friends & work colleagues Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) & James 'Sulley' Sullivan (John Goodman), together they work or Monstrs Inc. the company who supply all the power for Monstroplolis by bottling children's screams. Sulley is a top scarer who enters kids rooms through their closets & scares them so they will scream & Mike is his faithful assistant, however there is a power shortage & kids these days just don't scare easily. Late one night while sorting some paperwork out Sulley comes across a young child on the shop-floor, a shocking sight as great care is taken to make sure the kids never enter Monstropolis as the slightest of touches from just one child may be enough to kill a monster. Sulley has to hide the child from the authorities & find a way to get her back to her own room, however he discovers a sinister plot to kidnap lots of children from their bedrooms in an attempt to solve the energy crisis...Directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman & Lee Unkrich I personally think Monsters, Inc. is the greatest computer animated film I've ever seen & a film that I have great fondness for. The script by Andrew Stanton & Dan Gerson moves along seamlessly & has the perfect mix of humour, action & sentimentality. I loved the relationship between Sulley & little Boo as you can see him warming to her, surely this has to be one of the cutest & most likable on screen pairings ever, I think you would have to have a very cold heart not to feel a little bit of sadness at the end when Sulley has to say goodbye to Boo for the last time. They are also surrounded by some truly wonderful character's & friends, from the extremely funny Mike to his girlfriend Celia, from the slimy bad guy Randall & the adorable Abominable Snowman. I'm not a child, I'm not a teenager & by all counts the people around me keep saying I'm an adult but does that mean I can't enjoy a wonderful film such as this? Why do kids have all the fun? Quite frankly there is nothing that I don't like about this film, Monsters, Inc. is pure lovable brilliance from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that.The director's do a great job, they fill just about every inch of the screen with fantastic detail & visual delights. There is so much going on in both the foreground, background & corners of the frame, for instance I loved the scene when the blob creature slid over the grate & accidentally oozed down into it plus Celia's individual snake hairdo whom all have personalities of their own & loads more besides. The character designs are the perfect blend between cuteness & sliminess, this being a Disney film everyone is big & cuddly but they have a weird gooey multiple eyes & tentacles everywhere look to them as well. It's obvious that a lot of time & effort went into the production of Monsters, Inc. including the fact that it normally took 11 to 12 hours to render a single fame of Sulley because they animated each of his 2.3 million hair strands individually! You know that literally boggles my mind just thinking about it.I can't quite believe that Monsters, Inc. had a budget of about $115,000,000, I love the film to bits but all that money?! Every frame is beautifully rendered & animated but why so much? Anyway, the film is an absolute delight to watch & for that sort of cash it should be. Nominated for & won lots of awards including winning an Oscar for Best Music & it lost out to Shrek (2001) on the Best Animated Feature which I am not having at all, Monsters, Inc. beats Shrek hands down as far as I'm concerned, there is no justice. The voice actors add so much to the film, Crystal & Goodman are perfect as are Steve Buscemi & the imposing sounding James Coburn as the villains, Jennifer Tilly makes for a squeaky & cute sounding love interest.Monsters, Inc. is just about faultless as far as I'm concerned & hopefully it will appeal to the child in most adults while I'm positive any child will enjoy it immensely. It's totally brilliant in every way, there's nothing else to say. More than deserves it's place on the IMDb Top 250 films list. Watch it as soon as you can, that's an order not a request.","Monsters, Inc."

Its employees, being monsters, venture into children's bedrooms and scare them. Then one day, a child accidentally returns with a monster to Monstropolis, something which should never happen...Quite original story. Starts off in good fashion and is pretty good fun. However, after a point is really just one huge chase / caper movie and gets fairly predictable as a result. This is where adults will generally zone out (it was certainly where I started to lose interest) but kids should still enjoy it.Good voice casting, with John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly in the main roles.","Monsters, Inc."

""Monsters, Inc."" is a movie you can easily fall in love with. It has some great fun character, some awesome moments and some well placed comical moments. ""Monsters, Inc."" is entertainment at its bests.The voice cast is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life. Well done Pixar!Pure entertainment for the entire family!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","Monsters, Inc."
21,view_and_review,Pixar keeps rolling,7,21 June 2007,"""Monsters, Inc."" did a great social service. While not the best animation I've seen, it is still praiseworthy. Billy Crystal and John Goodman just didn't do it for me as the voices, and while the monsters weren't for scaring purposes, they were still monsters none the less, which means explanations to the kids. But, ""Monsters, Inc."" effectively alleviated the fears of children everywhere by humanizing monsters and making them funny even. And what better child social service could they have done than having the monsters try to get kids to laugh instead of scream and cry to power their city. I was impressed with ""Monsters, Inc."" which amounts to yet another gold star on Pixars resume. At this point Pixar can do no wrong. They could make an animated stick figures movie and still make it interesting.","Monsters, Inc."
22,neil-476,Excellent Pixar kids' movie,9,1 February 2013,"In the city of Monsteropolis, friends Sully and Mike work as scarers - they pop out of kids' closets at night and scare them into screaming, because Monsteropolis runs on scream energy. Trouble is, champion scarer Sully fails to scare little Boo, who then accompanies him back into Mosteropolis where, it seems, children are toxic.If you simply restate the plot (which continues at length after the brief synopsis above), the whole thing sounds completely loopy. Yet it works perfectly. The inhabitants of Monsteropolis are a varied and pleasing bunch, Boo is delightful, the story is involved but easy to follow, and full of action, suspense and excitement. The voice talent is, as always, exemplary, with John Goodman and Billy Crystal perfectly cast as Sully and Mike. And it's very funny.I have to say that I was disappointed with the 3D conversion. The chase in the door warehouse was, as expected, very effective, but otherwise I felt that they needn't have bothered: the 3D is barely noticeable.","Monsters, Inc."

But even Pixar's standard fare is better than many other things you could be watching, so it's definitely worth a look-see.John Goodman and Billy Crystal are the comedy duo who play our two main monsters as a sort of Bert and Ernie.

(2001): Dir: Pete Docter / Voices: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jennifer Tilly, John Ratzenberger: Delightful animation about change in attitudes and lifestyles. It regards the manufacturing of doors that portal the monsters into a child's room to scare them. The screams power their city. Top scare is Sully, a big blue hairy creature coached by a green eyeball with limbs named Mike. The villain the lizard-like Randall who can blend in with his surroundings. Central plot regards a little girl who accidentally enters their world, and Sully and Mike's struggle to conceal her. Amusing idea trails into formula. Inventive conclusion with imaginative directing by Pete Docter. Terrific vocal work by John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike. Sully is famed as the top scare monster while Mike is sort of his manager. Now they are met with a dilemma to help this young girl and discover that laughter is a much more powerful energy. Steve Buscemi voices Randall in what is the standard villain but his punishment fits the crime with amusing results. Jennifer Tilly voices a Meduca-like figure who acts as the romantic interest to Mike. The role is perhaps the weakest in the film. John Ratzenberger makes a great cameo voicing the Abominable Snowman who desires a change in the perception of him. Theme visualizes that there is more power in love than fear.

25,zetes,Pixar's glowing reputation takes yet another step forward,9,18 February 2002,"First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the ""Baby Mine"" song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of ""aww""s in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.As much as I would love to, I can't say that Monsters Inc. is a perfect film. There are a couple of flaws. The first fifteen minutes or so, basically until Boo wanders out into the monsters' world, are pretty boring. By this point, though, I was so amazed at the beauty of the artwork that I hardly cared. Also, most of the monsters aren't very interesting looking, that is, besides the colors. Raymond and the big boss of Monsters Inc., who is a spider-like creature, are the most interesting. Also, Billy Crystal's girlfriend in the film, a Medusa-like creature, with snakes for hair that copy her emotions, is very cool. Most of the other monsters are so cute that it's a wonder that they can scare children at all! (That's how they get fuel, by the way; children's screams power the monsters' world). Sully, for instance, who is the main character, more or less (the commercials concentrate on Billy Crystal's character more, for some reason; the logic must be that Billy Crystal is a bigger box office draw than big, fat John Goodman, a pretty insulting thought). Anyhow, Boo comes into the monsters' world because she thinks he is a giant kitty! We can't blame them too much for this, though. You know Disney would never produce a film that didn't have an ability to push their line of plush toys. Some of the monsters, though, are kind of boring. This is especially true with Mike, the little green cyclops ball played by Crystal. Sully could become a classic hero, and Raymond a classic villain, but it's doubtful Mike will stick in your head for as long. Crystal is, however, very funny in the film (and that might be the only time I'll ever say that!). He'll never be as boring as Shrek, nor as painful to listen to as Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek. The story of Monsters Inc. is full of cliches, which is unfortunate. As I've been trying to point out, most everything else about the film is so inventive that it's not too noticeable, but it will never be unnoticeable. You'll see the revelation that the monsters have at the end two hours before the movie starts. Your youngest child might not figure it out, but anyone over eight will know as soon as it's humanly possible. There's also the kind of betrayal that's popping up so often now in animation, well, in all movies, really, that you can almost take it for granted anymore. And, heck, I would've predicted it myself if I weren't being so enormously entertained! If it weren't for these cliches, Monsters Inc. might have ended up earning the title as one of the best movies I had ever seen. Still, I'll never forget it! Now, what can Pixar possibly do to surpass this? 9/10.","Monsters, Inc."
26,mm-39,This one is on my list to buy,9,27 September 2002,"This movie was absolutely funny.  John Goodman does an excellent voice for Sully.  The animation was great.  The facial expressions with the voices were out of this world.  This movie is for everyone.  It seems the animation is getting better and better, but you still have to get the perfect voices for each character.  Steve Buscemni plays as slime ball again.  This seems to be the only character he does well.  Billy Crystal was great too, but as I said John Goodman was the best.  The story was consistent and funny through out.  I was surprised to hear the voice of James Coburn.  The ending left room for a part II if they want to do one, but it will be very hard to beat this one.  9/10","Monsters, Inc."
27,StevePulaski,There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need?,9,20 June 2013,"Isn't it unfathomable that Monsters Inc. is now twelve years old? Even Pixar's first masterpiece Toy Story is quickly approaching twenty, which is equally unfathomable in any state of mind. Rewatching Monster's, Inc., in light of the upcoming prequel, I couldn't help but realize that Pixar hasn't changed a whole lot in their animation style. Little noticeable additions and upgrades such as lighting and texturing have been made, but changes like that are pretty much unnoticeable to the public. Pixar has been one of the few companies that has done little innovation to the overall layout and design of their animation since their breakout in 1995.Pixar, however, has to remain witty, original, and subversive in their material and story lines to remain the almighty, animation patriarch they've always been. In 2013, I'm proud to save I've never been letdown by a Pixar film so much so that I gave it a negative review. Even their lesser stories are better than Disney's average ones, and even a good Dreamworks movie is not usually the equivalent of an average Pixar one. Monsters, Inc. is a story that is cinematic bread-and-butter, combining the quirks and uniqueness of monsters and articulating their appeal to children wonderfully in a film. While the subject matter may have you thinking otherwise, this is a sweetly appropriate film for children over five, and unlike maybe some modern animated releases such as Hotel Transylvania this one doesn't segregate the viewer solely because they've seen more modern monster films than everyone in the audience.The plot concerns Mike (voiced by the lovable Billy Crystal), a stout, green, Cyclops-esque monster and his pal Sulley (John Goodman), a lovable, furry, blue monster and their duties at Monsters, Inc. The company is dedicated to frightening children of all ages after hours, and to do so, they use a series of doors, assigned to each monster. The doors look like they lead nowhere, but actually house a child's room behind them. When a monster walks back through the door, it is extracted from the ground and taken through an elaborate conveyor belt behind the scenes.Mike and Sulley always find themselves harassed by Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), who leaves a door on the floor, allowing a child to enter the premises so he can get them kicked out of Monsters, Inc. The child is two years old, unafraid of monsters, and thinks of Sulley as a lovable teddy-bear rather than a ferocious monster. The film follows Mike and Sulley as they try and hide the girl - who they nickname ""Boo"" (Mary Gibbs) - from their boss and try to keep their jobs intact.There's a surprising (and equally unsurprising) zealous energy to the material here. By having such a loose plot, the characters are free to roam in many different directions, trying to find a way to keep precious little ""Boo"" hidden from all the other monsters.Speaking of the other monsters, Pixar's creativity as a group seems to bleed through Monsters, Inc. as each character has their own artistic design and color scheme to go with them. No two monsters look alike, and none look anything like the classic movie monsters or basic retreads of them, showing Pixar's high creativity. Even if you remain unfazed by the story or the plot, the art design of the characters is something that will hold your attention for quite sometime.Monsters, Inc. is a charming affair that should be equally rewarding for adults as it will be their children. There's no reliance on immaturity, stupidity, or even blatant shallowness. There's a simple story handled appropriately under solid conditions from a great studio. What more do you need? Voiced by: Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Mary Gibbs. Directed by: Pete Docter.","Monsters, Inc."
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,"It's good, but not the best Pixar film",7,30 July 2005,"I enjoyed ""Monsters, Inc."", don't get me wrong. Over all, Monsters, Inc, was a good movie that I would recommend for the family and kids. Even for just the kids to watch alone, I'd highly recommend it. It has funny situations and very cool effects. After all, it is Pixar. By the way, do some movie fans find it a little funny that these computer effects by Pixar look more realistic than other FX movies? :D But was this the best Pixar film? No, not really. I prefer ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredables"". This was more aimed at the kids if anything, which I know was the main audience. But Pixar does try to add a little adult humor, which I felt that we didn't get enough of. That's my only complaint. Because I didn't laugh a lot like in ""The Incredables"" or ""Ice Age"". But I'd recommend ""Monsters, Inc."" for a good watch. It was fun.7/10","Monsters, Inc."
29,MovieAddict2016,"Does For Monsters What ""Toy Story"" Did For Toys!",10,12 March 2003,"Monsters, Inc.We were all, at one time, scared of monsters under the bed. Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, plays on both adults' memories and children's dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults.John Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as ""Sulley"" to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children's screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident...""Monsters, Inc."" does for monsters what ""Toy Story"" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my ""Toy Story"" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for ""Toy Story 3"") and gives them the bare minimum.But that is straying off the subject. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.Not only has Pixar brought back the ""Family Film"" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.5/5 stars","Monsters, Inc."

If you ever had a 'monster under your bed' or 'in your closet' when you were very, very young then you may get quite a few chuckles out of this film and while bringing back some comical childhood memories.On a personal note: I view this film as an animated comedy-horror due to the fact it's about (bed or closet) Monsters.If you enjoyed animated films like: ""Shrek"", ""A Bug's Life"", or ""Ice Age"" then Monsters, Inc. is a movie that you should enjoy.9/10","Monsters, Inc."

Didn't really stick as one of my childhood memories or anything like that but when I saw it as a kid is was a good watch nothing more. And didn't really watch it again until now because of ""Monsters University"". When we were kids most of us was scared of the dark or afraid of ghosts and monsters. Well in this world monsters do exist and they go around scaring kids by coming out of the closet for energy supply. But the thing is the monsters are as much as scared of the kids as the kids are to the monsters. But the main conflict starts when a kid comes into the monsters society. When it comes to kids in movies it can be a hit or a miss but in this case she is adorable. While having the kid demeanor and although the cause of the conflict and what drives the story but didn't really get annoying. And seeing it now I kinda enjoyed it more than when I saw it as a child. And as the story started to build although it's a very simple story it was fun, cute and kinda clever.

33,OllieSuave-007,See what really happens on the other side of the monster closet.,7,11 July 2015,"The events of this film, Monsters, Inc., follows that of Monsters University, even though Monsters, Inc. was released first. Here, monsters Mike Wazowski and James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan work at Monsters Inc., the utility company that powers the city from the goose bumps of children they scare after entering their bedrooms at night through their closets. Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into the monster world, causing chaos for the monsters since children are actually toxic to them.Like Monsters University, it is filled with humor, adventures and funny characters. The animation was great and I enjoyed watching the interaction between the monsters in their world and what actually happens on the other side of the closet door before the monster steps out into the child's bedroom. It certainly gives the audience a new perspective and meaning of the ""monster in the closet."" Even for a monster-themed film, Pixar makes it both exciting and family-friendly, keeping in with the tradition of Disney. The voice actors, particularly that of Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the lead roles, were great. They give Mike and Sullivan just the right touch of love-hate friendship, though I thought Mike went just a little overboard with his over-zealousness and frustration. And, the portrayal of the little girl was cute and innocent, but I thought was too annoying as the five year-old who runs into trouble all the time and displays just about every bad quality of a misbehaving child: moaning, crying and being mischievous in every possible way. But, the overall chemistry between her and Sully is quite touching.Overall, the story was pretty intriguing with an adventurous second half. Not a bad family film.Grade B-","Monsters, Inc."
34,llltdesq,"Beautifully animated, with excellent character design and development",10,9 December 2014,"This is an animated feature produced by Pixar. There will be spoilers ahead:There's a great deal to like about this film. The animation is wonderful, the characters are well designed and the characters mainly have strong, well developed personalities, particularly the two leads. The voice work of John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike is perfectly meshed, the two working together to make their characters come alive.The premise is that monsters are simply doing their job when they scare children (monsters in the closet, under the bed and so on) and the power which runs their city comes from screams. Sully is the champ and he and Mike are a team. The chief villain, more or less, is another monster and Sully's main rival, Randall, a chameleon voiced perfectly by Steve Buscemi. There's an interesting, probably unintentional, resonance back to another film and role for Buscemi in what happens to doors to children's rooms when the children are no longer sufficiently frightened by monsters. But I'm weird, so I would make the tenuous connection.The monsters are actually more terrified of children than children are of them and most of the movie turns on this, with a small girl named Boo (naturally) coming through her door into the monster's city. Much of the film is concerned with Sully and Mike trying to return Boo to her room.The action is fast and furious, the plot is well crafted and executed and it's a fun ride. The ending is perfect.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray and is well worth watching. Most highly recommended.","Monsters, Inc."
35,ElMaruecan82,"We scare, because we care...",8,30 June 2015,"If there's anything that ""Monsters Inc."" proves is that the greatest stories, whether targeting a young or older audience (or both within the same person), all rely on a simple yet original concept. It's so simple in the film that you can almost guess it from the title.What kind of products or services a company named ""Monsters, Inc."" can provide? Well, what do monsters do best? They scare... but as the tag-line says, it's only business. And like every business, you need a target. Kids, who else? But the real question is : what kind of business would require them to scare poor helpless little kids? Well this is where it gets tricky, in fact children's screams supply Monstropolis' daily needs of energy, as simple as that. Their slogan says ""We scare, because we care"", so all these monsters provide a necessary public service, and that one of their rules is to never get in contact with the children shows how actually harmless and worthy of our sympathy they are (or are they? ... suspenseful music).And to add to the enjoyment of a very creative premise, the exposition is a delightful sequence too, plunging us in a world populated by monsters, each one being a gag by himself. Indeed, I could easily figure out the instructions given to the artists during the making-of : ""every single monster must be unpredictable, different, funny and somewhat memorable"" so we get a succession of animal-like creatures with the most bizarre or sophisticated physical attributes, big, small, invisible, hideous, you name them. And leading the show, we have Sulley and Mike (yeah, it's an Americanized parallel universe, what's the matter?). Sulley is big blue furry one with purple spots, cool and friendly, and Mike the little green Cyclopes, wisecracking and talkative. And don't ask me which of the gentle giant and the Napoleon syndrome guy is voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal. Please, don't.To complete the imagery, the film is all about imagery anyway, some others monsters are such masterpieces of creativity they shouldn't even be called monsters. Like Celia, Mike's girlfriend, voiced by Jennifer Tilly, and whose dreadlocks-like hair are made of adorable little snakes with reactions that almost match their owner (almost). From the ugly sight of the bulged-eye chameleon-like Randal Boggs whose ability to change color borrows more from the invisible man powers, it's easy to guess who's the movie's bad guy and who dubs him of course? Simply, the most funny-looking actor with the same weird-looking eyes : Steve Buscemi. A final honorable mention for James Coburn who voices the CEO Mr Waternoose, a crab-like cigar-smoking head of company who treats his best monster Sulley like a son and Roz, a daunting secretary with a ravaged-by-smoking voice that sounds like scratching fingers on a chalkboard.And all this colorful gallery works in ""Monsters Inc."" following a daily routine that coincides with Earth children's bedtime, the company provides a warehouse full of millions of doors from all over the world and each one leading to kids' bedrooms, a parallel universe we're most familiar with or used to. And this is where the little Disney magic works again : the film rings that sensitive chord reminding us the time from our childhood when we were afraid ghosts or monsters would come from the closet. Well, I was more afraid of clowns or wild animals and I was more staring at the window with fearful eyes, but psychologically speaking, that's not the point.So, let's get back to ""Monsters, Inc."". Like any company, they have to face real market issues, one of them is kids growing more and more insensitive to violence, this is why they only hire the best of the best, the monster's 'right stuff' as suggested by the hilarious slow-motion sequence parodying the famous astronaut-walking scene. And apparently, Sulley is about to break the company's record, closely followed by his jealous rival, Randall. But one of Randall's evil schemes allows Sulley to discover that there's one little child he does't scare, a little girl nicknamed 'Boo' who grew an instant fondness on Sulley, inversely proportional to the fear Boggs inspired her. From fear to realization, Sulley also develops feelings toward Boo, and we know where this is leading, that drop of tear for an ocean of thrills and laughs, made-in-Disney.The third Pixar movie is another little touchstone of creativity and imagery that will delight kids and adults. It's good, it's even great at times, yet it lost to ""Shrek"" that year, and rightfully so, for Shrek had a less sophisticated concept but treated with more wit and heart. And a parody of fairy material could only win over a concept that, as creative as it is, relies on one gimmick. ""Monsters, Inc"" has heart too, and some moments between Sully and Boo will make a few eyes cry. But somehow, the film was victim of its own concept, and commits many mistakes with the whole door and closet systems, thus featuring a series of plot contrivances at the crucial final act. Not to mention the little resolution that plays like a nice twist but is revealed to early in the film to leave an impact.Still, a very good film.","Monsters, Inc."
36,paul2001sw-1,Lively and fun,7,21 January 2011,"'Monsters Inc.' is a Disney (or at least, a Pixar) film. Which means one has a corporate satire made by one of the world's most powerful corporations; and a tale where two friends (one talkative, one cute) argue but always get together in the end to ensure that everyone lives happily ever after. If the template is familiar, the film also marked a move away from the realistic animation of 'Toy Story' (the first wave of computer animation) back towards something more obviously cartoony. It also lacks 'Toy Story's bleak undercurrents, but it's generally fun and inventive, even if you can spot the end coming a long way off.

I am a big fan of Buscemi so that made me like Randall even more.In the city of Montropolis(or whatever it's called), the energy comes from the screams of little children. But, the city are in a energy crisis because they haven't been getting many screams. Two monsters, Sully and Mike, accidentally let a child loose in the city. Now they have to deal with the child and a evil plot regarding the energy crisis.I should have seen this when it first came out because I did that with other Pixar movies.

After all these years, and so many amazing creations, I still consider it to be one of Pixars greatest work. In terms of humor, it always makes me laugh the most, with so much quotable moments. As well as that, it manages to maintain a lot of emotion and depth in to this insane universe, we gain a genuine care for these characters, viewing them as a lot more that just animated monsters by the end of it. I have seen this film countless times, I watched it in the theatre when I was only four years old, and am still watching it today with as much enthusiasm and joy. It has amazing replay value and is a roller-coaster of different emotions throughout, which the best movies are. The voice cast is this film could not have been any better in terms of casting. John Goodman is stellar as Sully, he adds so much to the character's demeanour. The relationship between him and Boo is one of the sweetest in any movie, and the ending still brings me to tears every time. I also love the bond between him and Mike Wazowski, one of my favourite duos of all time. Billy Crystal is phenomenal as Mike, every piece of dialogue is fantastic and the layers to this character are incredible, making him one of my favourite characters of all time. Lastly, such great protagonists need a good antagonist, and they found a perfect one with Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, he's an intimidating, somewhat sociopathic villain who we love to hate, and the movie would not be the same without him. It is a feel good animated film that is timeless and fun for all ages. Hilarious and heartwarming, I could not recommend Monsters, Inc. enough, definitely worth the watch if you are looking for a good family or animated film.

Well, I have to admit that it did turn out to be a good idea, especially since this film is actually quite enjoyable. Yeah, it's mainly for the kids, but Disney does have this way of making films that adults can appreciate as well, not that there is a huge amount of adult content in it. However, there are some subtle things about it that does make it rather charming.Anyway, the film is set in the city of Monstropolis where they get all of their power from children screaming. Yet, there is this story going around that children aren't allowed into the realm because they could wreck havoc. Mind you, it turns out that there is some subtle manipulation going on here because the reality is that if children are no longer scared of monsters, then they won't scream, and as such they won't be able to get any more power, so of course they make up this story that children can't touch monsters because, well, they are dangerous.So, there happens to be this rather sneaky, shape-shifting, lizard called Randal who is attempting to get to the top of the charts for the number of screams that he can get, and he decides to do some overtime. Well, what happens is that this little girl comes into monster land and our heroes suddenly find that she is following them around. Yeah, it becomes pretty obvious pretty quickly that children aren't as dangerous as they are said to be, which means that there is more going on than meets the eye.Interestingly, one could say that there are lots of connections between this film, and the current energy debate that is raging around the Earth. In fact, it turns out that there are ways to get more energy than simply getting children to scream, but people don't seem to be looking in that direction. Mind you, it also makes me wonder, with all the power that Disney has, that they can't push the debate towards more renewable sources of energy.Yeah, you could suggest that getting children to scream is sort of a non-renewable form of energy, especially considering that once a child is no longer scared of a monster, there is nothing they an do to change that. However, there are other ways, as I indicated, some of them good, some of them not so good. As you can probably suspect, Randal is looking at a rather not so good way of getting more energy.This film, as I suggested, is actually rather enjoyable, and does ask some serious questions in a way that is quite light hearted as well. Yeah, I liked it.","Monsters, Inc."
42,UniqueParticle,Loved as a kid still do at 28!,10,5 December 2020,This is one of the best movies ever created by Pixar that makes me feel good! I had toys of some of the characters those were fond memories to me maybe cause I'm an aspie; I crave being different. John Goodman and Billy Crystal shine so well I appreciate them in this and all they're other roles! So many great lines that still hold up as charming awesomeness! I'm glad I decided to watch this after a tough day really cheered me up.,"Monsters, Inc."
43,paulclaassen,Awesome animation film with great underlying theme.,7,5 June 2018,"This is a really great movie premise, and very well executed. One can't help but fall in love with the characters, and thankfully the voicing was perfect. The animation was amazing and this is a film that will appeal to a young and mature demographic. The Monsters Inc corporation itself was an amazing undertaking and very well laid out. This is one of my favorite animation films.","Monsters, Inc."
44,briancham1994,Funny and stylish,9,21 August 2020,"This film has a really cool style that combines monster characters with an industrial setting (hence the title). This is used to its full potential as the plot centres around a child coming from our world through a portal. The humour and voice acting are pretty compelling, especially the villain Randall.","Monsters, Inc."
45,zkonedog,Laughs + Heart = Fun,8,6 March 2017,"Disney/Pixar movies always work best on the ""funny + heart"" formula. ""Monsters, Inc."", while not absolutely perfecting that formula, works well enough to produce another solid animation effort.For a basic plot summary, this movie poses that the ""monster in the closet"" you were scared of as a kid was indeed real and just trying to scare you to collect your screams, which powers their entire industry. One ""routine day at the Monster scare factory"", however, top scare-er Sulley (John Goodman) and pal Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) bring a small girl back into their own world, wreaking havoc along the way and learning a pretty valuable lesson in the process.To be sure, ""Monsters, Inc."" is a great animation effort. It is witty (for both adults and children), full of action/adventure, and has a lot of heart/emotions weaved into the proceedings. Especially standing out here is the voice acting from Crystal and Goodman, whose characters have such a great report with each other.The only reason I give the movie four stars instead of five is because, unlike the top tier of Disney/Pixar efforts like Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, and Up, this one shies away from the take-home message when it could have embraced it. For example, and I'll try to be as spoiler- free as possible here, towards the end of the movie the two leads make a discovery (which is hinted at throughout the film) that will change the ""Monster world"" forever. Instead of really delving into the consequences of that revelation, however, the producers choose to ""keep things simple"" and not get too deep. I think they could have gone a little deeper and doing so would have vaulted this one into the upper echelon.Overall, though, ""Monsters, Inc."" is a fun film that the entire family can enjoy. While it may not be the absolute best of its kind, it is still easily better than most.","Monsters, Inc."
46,johnnyboyz,Monster laughs and nothing but praise for this Disney-Pixar effort.,7,30 April 2019,"Without giving the name of the author, Canadian social commentator Mark Steyn cited a piece of writing during a 2012 interview with an American cable-TV company which was about how children perceive the world around them through the fiction they're exposed to early on in life. Principally, he cites an analysis made by a fellow-Canadian on how creatures, or 'monsters', on television, or in cutesy books, were damaging to kids - it imparted the idea that monsters were just cute, cuddly friends that needed taming or befriending. Steyn seemed to prefer 'classic' children's literature in this respect, because there you garner a '...far greater sense of the realities of life from the Brothers Grimm than you will from the Cookie Monster.'I wonder what either of them thought of ""Monsters Inc."", where the one infant character in the film is completely unafraid of precisely the sorts of post-Sesame Street monsters the article cited, yet is a character in a piece imparting the idea that cute and cuddly is good. To some extent, Disney's 2002 animation plays like a kind of animated therapy for young children, who will of course love the colour; vibrancy and sense of adventure infused throughout ""Monster's Inc."", but will also have one of their fears exorcised - that of the dark bedroom at night-time and the idea a creature might lurk beyond a visible realm.At the core of the film is a quite brilliant idea: in an alternate world running parallel to our own, there exist actual creatures, hideous in physicality, desperately in need of the terrified screams of young children so as to run their civilisation. In order to do so, they appear in bedroom closets around the world late at night (the only gateway from our own universe to theirs); do what they have to do to induce sheer panic and return home again having captured the noise in a canister. One of the film's best jokes, in fact, doubles up as a devilish social commentary on how much harder it is these days to truly frighten children, given what they are often exposed to on TV and in video games.The scream-drive is propelled by two monsters called Sully and Randall, whose physical characteristics are cleverly echoed by their voice-talents: Sully, like John Goodman, is big and huggable and has a dopey voice, whilst Steve Buscemi's lizard-like creation is more slender and bug-eyed. Sully is the consummate professional who goes through the same process every morning: exercising and scare routines with his flat-mate and floor-work partner Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). He blindly trusts the corporation, epitomised quite cleverly in the arachnid-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who sports a waist-coat but is tragically missing a monocle. Children are Sully's worst enemy, believing them to be potentially toxic. Regardless, he puts his life on the line every day for his society - the moral justification for all this lies in the company's motto: 'We scare, because we care'.As each of the monsters in the company lumbered with this responsibility walk to their posts in slow motion, the film invokes Michael Bay's 1998 film ""Armageddon"", which infers a sense of doom or catastrophe if these brave souls were to fail in their duty: these people are the guardians of civilisation. Civilisation does not quite crumble, but disaster strikes when a young American child manages to make its way out of our world and into the monsters' own - enough to have Sully and Mike worried their days are numbered as previous misnomers have led to other monsters banished to our world, cleverly accounting for Bigfoot and the Yeti. In a panic, the twosome concoct a plan to return it to where it belongs, but that becomes problematic when Sully becomes attached to it.""Monsters Inc."" cracks along at a fantastic pace and works so wonderfully well because of a number of things. Principally, the stakes are incredibly high, so there is always this rapid, even nervous, energy pulsating through the film once the 20 minute mark elapses, and the film does such a wonderful job in bringing the two personalities in the form of its heroes to life in such a short space of time that we are hooked on their adventure the whole way. Furthermore, the characterisation is superb - these are rounded characters with lives; dreams; goals and even girlfriends - they possess different attitudes; physical appearances and characteristics. The world it creates, that of one parallel to our own, is extraordinary from a design perspective - the way they echo one another in the form of a daily commute; workplace rivalry; a relaxing meal after work and generally the things you see out and about is marvellous.What directors Pete Docter; David Silverman and Lee Unkrich later pull off is the incredibly tricky transition the film needs to make from being a double-act comedy about getting rid of something which doesn't want to leave, to being a film about foiling a corporate conspiracy. One cannot laud the team enough. Laudable too is the character study - this is Sully's film; a character who blindly trusts the machine at the beginning of the film but undergoes his own journey to find out that kids are not toxic; corruption might come from anywhere and even tackles the moral dilemma of how to power his world. Irrespective of age, and with whomever you see it, ""Monster's Inc."" is a genuinely infectious and wholesome piece of animated entertainment.","Monsters, Inc."
47,Rectangular_businessman,Cute movie,9,8 May 2012,"""Monsters Inc."" is such a cute movie, being one of the most underrated films done by Pixar. While it is true that is not at the same level than other Pixar masterpieces, such as the ""Toy Story"" trilogy or ""Up"", this movie is highly enjoyable, having many likable characters, and excellent animation (Which is pretty impressive, even by today's standards, with many imaginative designs and expressive characters) ""Monsters Inc."" it's both funny and heartwarming, having and Boo is one of the most adorable characters ever made in the history of animated CGI films. In the recent years, even with all the technological advances, it is very hard to find another character done by computer to be as endearing and iconic as her.More than a decade later after this movie was released, ""Monsters Inc."" still remains as an excellent example of how to make a CGI animated films. I'm sure that with the time, it eventually it will became as iconic as the Disney classics.","Monsters, Inc."
48,TheMovieDiorama,Monsters Inc showcases the imagination and originality of Pixar's early days.,9,24 February 2018,"We all have films we grew up with, earning a sense of nostalgia that may skew the true reflection of the film. Monsters Inc is one of those. It's a little rough around the edges, but the finished product will always be one that I will truly appreciate. Monstropolis is powered by energy garnered from children's screams. Sully and Mike go to work just like any normal day, except they accidentally let a child into the world of monsters. Normal day has now just taken a turn for the more eventful. Comedy ensues with various antagonists being revealed and a surprising touching ending that packs a punch to the heart. One of the greatest additions to the animation genre, this flick shows that pure imagination is able to extend its captivation beyond a good narrative and aesthetically pleasing visuals. It's all in the details! Explaining how the door system works, why the city needs screams, showing the partnership between the scarer and their companion. It fills in all the gaps to complete a greater picture, adding that finesse. The world doesn't feel populated for the sake of it, it naturally breathes life through the art of animation. It's what Pixar is famous for. I loved how they deconstructed the ""monsters in the closet"" theme, which most definitely appeals to all audiences. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were the perfect voice actors, I cannot envisage anyone else replacing them. Sully and Mike are John and Billy. It's a done deal. Irreplaceable. The dialogue between them was intuitive and felt seamless. Quick banter with boundless quotes...""put that thing back where it came from!"". Randall was a memorable villain that was underplayed, not overly sinister which I appreciated. Certain scenes were rushed, like Mike coming back from the Himalayas, but it's not a major detriment. Monster's Inc just screams imagination. Its ingenuity and originality will appeal to everyone and is a stepping stone for cementing Pixar as one of the best animation studios.","Monsters, Inc."
49,BaronBl00d,Coming Out of the Closet,8,24 July 2006,"Great Pixar animated film about two monsters living in Monstropolis - a land outside human land where monsters of all sorts live. Power is generated by the screams of children from Monsters, Inc. - a factory where doors of small children are presented in assembly-line fashion for monsters to walk through and scare children. I was overwhelmed with the concept of the film for its incredible imagination, innovation, and creativity. The folks at Pixar always seem to be able to pull films like this off with ease. At the heart of this film is the friendship of one huge, all-time(almost) scare monster and his assistant - voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal respectively. The characters are penned to fit the voices like hands to gloves. The puns and funny wordplay, particularly by Crystal, are an added bonus and raises much of this as just being another kid's movie. It isn't. What happens? Well, a child manages to come in to the monster world and chaos and fun ensue, but also an emotional quality is created with the depth of characterization of Sully(Goodman). The additional voices by Bob Peterson, James Coburn, and oily Steve Buschemi - not to mention Pixar stalwart John Ratzenberger as the Abominable Snowman(monsters like these had been banished - love the concept again!) greatly enhance the film. But it is the magical animation which seems real more often than not that really propels the engine of this film. This is impressive entertainment from a company that knows what entertainment is all about. In one scene, if you look closely, you will see the child in her room and have a small toy of a clown fish - a couple years before Pixar released Finding Nemo. Love the clever nature of these folks. Any film that can explain to my satisfaction, covering all bases, why monsters come out of closets has to be pretty good.","Monsters, Inc."
50,damianphelps,Simply Charming,8,4 October 2020,"A wonderful movie that's fun for kids and adults.The animation is delightful, the story intriguing and most importantly fun!Highly recommend only for those people who like to have a great time!","Monsters, Inc."
51,digitalbeachbum,Good clean fun,8,17 April 2021,"One of my favorite Pixar movies. It is great for the entire family because it has no bad language, no sex and no real violence. It has a great cast of characters and brings to life that scary childhood experience with monsters in the closet. I like that they added a lot of adult added bits which allow the parents to have a bit of fun also.","Monsters, Inc."
52,insomniac_rod,A movie suited for all ages. Disney style.,10,17 August 2008,"A really good movie that fits for all audiences. ""Monsters Inc."" is not strictly a children movie because it has a plot that gets the attention of kids and parents. The plot has always been a mystery to me. Let me explain myself... The plot is VERY similar to the one of a Troma's 80's flick called ""Monster In The Closet"". The idea of the Troma movie is Horror oriented for children (you know, Troma style) and Monsters Inc. gives the plot a direction of fantasy. I don't know if there's a relationship between both movies.Anyways, ""Monsters Inc."" has a beautiful plot, great animation effects, a perfect score, and best of all, a sense of humor that fits for all audiences. I watched this back on the theaters in 2001 with my girlfriend at the time and we had a great time even though I'm a fan of Horror movies. That's the example of how this movie can be enjoyed by everyone. Join Sully and Mike W. in this beautiful ride. It has moral lessons about friendship, responsibility, and best of all, the tenderness of children.","Monsters, Inc."

54,Vartiainen,Entertaining and endearing,7,13 April 2012,"Not Pixar's strongest work - for me that's Wall-E - but still a great proof that the studio has the ability to turn the simplest of ideas upside down and give us something that we haven't seen before. Like in this case where the simple idea of monsters hiding in the closets of little children is given a completely new spin by making those monsters part of industry. They're just punch clock workers trying to earn a living. Ingenious idea, really.And the execution supports and strengthens that idea beautifully. The whole world full of these hideously weird creatures is laid bare in front of us, but we quickly find out that they're just like us with their mundane lives, romantic relationships and bad fur days. And therein lies the strength of this movie and Pixar movies in general. The characters are immensely identifiable and sympathetic. The moment that you see any of these characters, the moment that they open their mouth and start talking, you get them. You start living their lives from their perspective. (Though I have to say that I saw the Finnish dub of this movie, in which the voice acting, while decent, wasn't anything special, so I think that the movie had already lost part of its charm at that point, because the English version is full of talented actors, so it's probably the better version of this film.)For me the best part of this film was the relationship between Sulley (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs). That little ninja girl is unbelievably adorable to begin with and then you add a ten feet tall blue hair monster cooing at her... It just melted my heart every time I saw it and made the ending even more precious to witness.If there's anything wrong with this film, it's that the story isn't that strong. It's your basic someone screws up and the status quo has to be restored without that someone getting into trouble, but of course something goes wrong and hilarity ensues. Nothing special there, but it was enjoyable to watch, so I wouldn't really call it a flaw as Pixar has the talent to work with simple stories. For them it's more about the characters and the details, not the story.So yeah, it's a good movie. Highly recommended for children and adults alike.","Monsters, Inc."
55,Vartiainen,What's behind the door?,7,4 January 2019,"It's such an odd premise for a movie, but yet it works so well. What if the monsters hiding in your closet are real and what if they have a society of their own, behind that door. What would that society look like and what part the scaring of little children would play in it.You can definitely build a movie around that and Pixar does so beautifully. In the process we get introduced to James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and Michael ""Mike"" Wazowski, the top scaring duo Monsters, Inc. has ever seen. Things go well, until a little girl child, adorably and promptly named Boo, slips through the door. Hijinks do indeed ensue.The movie has a strong idea and some topnotch characters going for it. I thoroughly enjoyed the relationship between Sully and Boo. The rest of the cast are voiced by some really talented people and all of the main cast have really great designs as well. I especially enjoyed Henry J. Waternoose III, the CEO. The side and background characters looked a bit more generic and blobbish in contrast, which is a shame, but then again they're not the focus.The only real flaw the film has is the story. It's not bad by any means, but it is not as strong as the other elements. Status quo is king, something upsets the status quo, hijinks, solution. No real surprises, no great stakes. I would have liked to explore the world a bit more or move beyond the obvious bad guy good guy setups.Still, a great animation film for all ages. Definitely worth a watch.","Monsters, Inc."
56,taylorkingston,An adorable movie...,7,20 August 2015,"I love this movie. It's so adorable. It's so completely different than any other children's movie from around this time. It has a great storyline, and very funny scenes. But it also has heart, and moments that are very heartfelt, and touching. I think it's a great movie for any kid, or adult.In this movie, we visit a world completely made up of monsters. Their power source is actually the screams of human children. So everyone who works at Monsters Inc., in the scare facility, use special doors to go into children's rooms whilst they sleep, and scare them. They then collect the screams. Which is actually super creepy, monsters sneaking into children's rooms whilst they're asleep. But then a human girl ""escapes"" into the monsters world, and Sulley and Mike, a scarer, and a scarer assistant, they have to try to hide her, and get her back into the right bedroom. Recommended for: Any child who likes comedy and heart, people who like Walt Disney and Pixar movies.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Great.","Monsters, Inc."
57,jamesrupert2014,Monstrously clever and funny early Pixar CGI feature,9,8 January 2019,"Sully and Mike (voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) are employees at Monsters Inc., a scream-fueled plant that provides power to Monsteropolis. Screams are generated by 'scarers' (and Sully is the best), who enter children's bedrooms via the closet and are harvested by their partners (in Sully's case, his best friend Mike). Extreme care must be taken, as children are highly toxic to monsters, so when one is accidently transported to the factory, pandemonium ensues. The film is the fourth of Pixar's full length animated features and like most of the studio's work, is excellent. The story is fun with a clever 'twist' to the ending, the animators manage to inject a tremendous amount of character and personality into the CGI characters, and the choice of voice talent is perfect (I especially liked Steve Buscemi as the chameleonic villain Randall). CGI technology has advanced considerably since the film was released but the imagery still holds up and the vast 'closet door' storage facility is great. Typical of the studio, there are a lot of amusing details in the background that are worth watching for. Good, timeless fun for all ages.","Monsters, Inc."
58,strong-122-478885,Boo & Kitty & All Those Blasted Closet Doors,6,21 February 2015,"When it comes to ""coming-out-of-the-closet"" (Ha! Get the pun?), you can be sure that a star ""Monster Incorporated"" employee, such as Sulley or Randall, are the type of monsters who don't mess around. No. These guys mean business when they step out from behind a child's closet door.For the most part, I enjoyed Monsters Inc. and found it to be quite imaginative as it told its cute, little tale of forbidden friendship and defying authority.Set in the make-believe world of Monstropolis, where everyone's a literal monster (but usually a nice monster), we find that this urban centre's electrical power is generated from harnessing the screams of human children who are, nightly, scared out of their wits by the hideous, growling creatures who emerge, like demons, from out of their darkened, bedroom closets.As we soon discover - A monster is, of course, forbidden to ever come into direct contact with a child, as the touch of these beings is both more toxic & deadly than any plague or disease imaginable.Directed by Pete Docter (writer of Toy Story, Wall-E, Up), Monsters Inc. is a delightfully colourful, CG animated tale which tells us, plain & simple, that laughter is, indeed, 10x more powerful than a scream.2 thumbs-up to Pixar Studios for delivering this good-natured, little gem that's sure to entertain audiences of all ages.","Monsters, Inc."
59,dfranzen70,Boogeymen with a Conscience,8,29 November 2001,"In the workaday world of monsters, Monsters, Inc. is the prime power provider.  The workers at the company get the energy by emerging from kids' closets and scaring the beejeezus out of them. The subsequent screams are then bottled and used to power Monstropolis.The company's top scarer is James P. Sullivan, aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman). His sidekick/best friend is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Here's how it works. Doors from kids' rooms appear from a giant warehouse in the company's behemoth building. The scarer opens the door and steps into the kid's bedroom and scares the heck out of the little tyke. As the screams come, they fill up empty canisters, the kind in which one might find helium for balloons, which the sidekick keeps at the ready. Then the monster steps out, the leaderboard reflects the changes (they're very competitive there, you know), and another door is procured. The sidekick takes care of all of the paperwork. But kids aren't getting scared the way they used to, and there's a power shortage afoot.There's one huge rule, though. Never come in contact with one of the kids, or any of the stuff from their rooms. The kids are toxic and will kill you on contact. (At one point, a particularly gruesome monster comes out of the room with a tiny sock velcroed to his fur; an emergency is declared, and a crack Kid Detection team races in to decontaminate the scene - and the monster, who gets quite a nasty shave. It's all innocuous enough, but it's also reflective of current events, although the movie was certainly written a while ago.)One evening, Sulley offers to do the paperwork so Mike can go on a date with his beloved Celia (Jennifer Tilly). There aren't supposed to be any doors left on the floor after hours, but there one is, and Sulley's just inquisitive enough to open it. Whoops! A kid comes out. Hilarity ensues. Sulley races to get Mike, and they both panic. I mean, think of it! A KID, there in Monstropolis! They fear for their lives! And of course all the while the kid, whom Sulley names Boo, is being a cute, adorable, curious little rugrat. This film was done by the Pixar people, the same nice folks who brought Toy Story and A Bug's Life to you. The animation is wonderful, although I'm not sure it's quite on par with Toy Story as far as the monsters go. The animation of the little girl, however, is fabulous. The animators must have kids of their own, because every nuance I can think of that a little kid would have was captured beautifully in this movie. The actors providing the voices are a lot of fun, too. Whoever cast John Goodman and Billy Crystal is probably suffering from a dislocated shoulder from patting themselves on the back so much. The two stars have great chemistry, bordering on Laurel and Hardy-ish.This is a bellyacher of a film, although admittedly it's not one that the intellectual snob would particularly enjoy. While the audience is the teeter-totter set, there is no overabundance of flatulence jokes - in fact, there aren't any. This is good clean (literally) fun.","Monsters, Inc."
60,drqshadow-reviews,"Emotive, Innovative, Captivating Pixar Magic",10,14 March 2017,"Tables turn as a charming young girl bursts through her own closet door and sends shivers through the monsters on the other side. Everything about this is wonderful, from the essentially Pixar concept to the warm, sentimental relationships at its core. Even the animation has held up quite well, which isn't always the case with these early CG efforts: humans still look a bit wonky, but most of the cast seems drawn straight from the pages of a Caldecott winner and that kind of bright, absurd character works beautifully. John Goodman and Billy Crystal carry most of the heavy-lifting as Mike and Sulley, blue collar creatures with an easy, free-flowing rapport, but three-year-old Mary Gibbs threatens to steal the scene every time she gets the chance with her adorable almost-words and penetrating good cheer. Exceedingly well-balanced, with the kind of imagination that keeps mouths gaping and so much heart, even the boogeyman might have to fight back a tear or two. One of my favorites of the entire Pixar catalog, it swings hard and connects on every level. Sweet, sad, silly and stupendous, a timeless classic that I was glad to share with my kids.","Monsters, Inc."
61,CubsandCulture,Introduced a major talent,10,29 December 2020,"Pete Doctor would go onto helm several other Pixar projects-Up, Soul, Inside Out etc.-most of which are absolute top tier Pixar. I would go as far as to say that Doctor has a stronger filmography than Lasseter. His work is truly multifaceted and conceptual. Monsters, Inc. is no different. The film can be read in several ways-as metaphor for the fossil fuel crisis, a cautionary parable about capital's greed or abstract musing the relative power of emotion fear, angst vs. joy laughter. The story is endlessly inventive in its genre and blurs the boundary between fantasy, sci-fi. It's a buddy comedy, a heist plot, a fish out of water story and a coming of age tale wrapped together in some of the fastest 90 minutes in cinema. It is funny, charming, and delivers even a few scares.The animation-like always-is breathtaking. But of the early Pixar films this one has the strongest design. The denizens of the monster world straddle the line between scary, playful which is perfect for the plot. Randall is a great slimy villain and Mike is literally a goofball. The film somehow manages to feel very 1950's without being dated, creaky. There are so many visual jokes I pick up a new one now and then despite seeing the film dozens of times.But above all it is the two relationships the film is built around-Mike & Sully, Sully & Bo-are fully realized. The film is filled with emotion, pathos because as fanciful as the setting is the characters are grounded in common humanity.","Monsters, Inc."
62,snoozejonc,"If you are struggling to get a young one to sit through a movie, try this",9,16 May 2021,"A 'scarer' from the monster world forms a bond with a very young human child.This is an immensely enjoyable, feel-good movie with a clever concept, great characters and brilliantly animated storytelling.The plot is a funny and moving friendship tale with a dash of adventure, but the fantasy concept that underlies it is another fantastic idea from the Pixar writers.Monsters Inc has numerous great scenes and hilarious banter between the characters. Much like the Toy Story, it makes you laugh and chokes you up at will, such is the quality of the characterisation.One of its strengths is the thought and detail that goes into the various aspects of the monster world and how it interacts with our world. Everything that happens in Monsters Incorporated, the use of doors, screams, laughter and how characters move between worlds is superb.The visuals as you would expect from Pixar are brilliant. The characters are superbly animated with fantastic colours, textures and expressions. As for the visual storytelling, it is so good that it held my daughter for the duration of the running time when she was about two years old. The final scene in particular is incredibly well done.All the voice performances are excellent with a number of perfectly cast roles for the likes of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, John Ratzenberger, Jennifer Tilly, James Coburn and Bob Peterson.","Monsters, Inc."

'Monsters, Inc.' is one of my favourite Disney animated films.The cast and characters are what sets this above the majority of the studio's other work, with so many memorable ones involved. John Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) make for an outstanding duo in the lead roles, they are truly perfect for their respective roles.Elsewhere, you have the excellent Steve Buscemi portraying Randall to terrific effect. There are also memorable roles for James Coburn (Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia) and Bob Peterson (Roz). You, of course, also have Boo (Mary Gibbs) who is simply adorable.Everything else from the plot to the animation is fantastic, too - I have no faults with this film.

MONSTERS INC is one of the finest efforts of that period, a comedy both humane and thrilling. The design of the characters and the world is like something out of a child's imagination, while the story is well-plotted and engaging.As a child, I recall being most interested in the buddy comedy elements and the chase scene through the colorful warehouse filled with bedroom doors. As an adult, I've come to better appreciate how the movie works as a parable about becoming a parent. Sully is initially interested in his own glory and the petty goal of being the best. When Boo comes into his life, everything changes-- everything he believed was important turns out to be nothing compared to the fatherly love he feels for her. It's sweet without rotting your teeth and the ending... oh God, it still makes me cry.One of Pixar's best, without a doubt.","Monsters, Inc."
65,dwpollar,Funny and well made animated film from the Pixar group...,7,1 January 2013,"1st watched 12/29/2012 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Pete Docter & David Silverman): Funny and well made animated film from the Pixar group with a simple story, but technically well executed. The story is about an alternate world where monsters gain energy for their existence by getting screams from children by scaring them after entering their world from their closet doors. The company, ""Monsters, Inc"", captures this energy and Sully, voiced by John Goodman, is the highest energy producer for them. His friend Mike, voiced by Billy Crystal, is his assistant. The evil character is the runner-up color-shifting monster that is behind Sully in energy points, but is found out to be cheating by capturing kids and extracting the screams out of them with a machine. One kid, named Boo by Sully, escapes and Sully and Mike have to figure out how to get her back to her real world and expose the evil monster's doings to the company. They do a lot of retread simple ""TV show""-type of humor around this story which makes the movie not as good as it could have been, but the animation is superb and unique enough to keep you interested until the end. The 3D is good and not over-bearing showing the perspective and size of some of the animated sets where the characters work in. This is not the best of the Disney animated films because of the simplistic story, but there is the usual expert craftsmanship that has definitely gone into this like so many of the others. The computer animation is very good despite it's 2001 release and I have to say that this is a worthwhile effort in the Disney cannon despite it's shortcomings in the story.","Monsters, Inc."
66,Kdosda_Hegen,Nothing too special.,5,4 August 2020,"Maybe it's because I hadn't seen it until now, but I wasn't a huge fan of this. Animation hasn't aged well, tons of poor low poly textures.

67,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,"Monsters, Inc.",9,23 April 2021,"A classic Pixar film, sadly I didn't see it too often growing up as I don't think we had it on DVD I did however see it a number of times and new the rough plot, like a Bug's Life this film is really growing on me, it is really quite good.","Monsters, Inc."
68,Enchorde,Those guys couldn't scare anyone...,7,25 September 2005,"Recap: Sulley and Mike work at the scare factory as the top team of scarers. See the monster town use children's scream as energy. But the factory is in a crisis, more and more children are not afraid of the monsters. And would they actually touch one of the monsters, the monster would die, or so the rumor goes anyway. So, as a result, most monsters are more scared of the children than the other way around. One night the terrible accident happens. A little girl enters the monster world! Panic! Afraid to get the blame for the accident, Sulley and Mike hides the girl and tries to send her back without anyone noticing. But something is going on at the factory, the top rival monster to Sulley seem to know more about the accident than he should.Comments: I am not surprised the monsters having trouble scaring anyone. They're too cute to that. Once again Pixar has made a beautifully and spectacularly animated movie. Especially Sulleys fur is impressive. What the monster lack in scare-factor though they make up in fun-factor. Many monster have some fun feature or behavior. The story in itself is fun too. One should keep in mind though, that this is a movie made for families. That means it lack the suspense and some of the fun twists you might hope for in a movie made for a grown up audience. I guess most kids in proper age will love this, but their parents, or if you like me watch this anyway, will be entertained as well. The movie is fun.7/10","Monsters, Inc."
69,Agent10,The best animated film of 2001,9,21 May 2002,"In my opinion, this film should have won the first Oscar for animated film. Don't get me wrong, Shrek was good, but this film had a little more passion put into it. The story and characters were more diverse and, the animation was much more complicated. Kudos to the casting agent who was able to bring in talent like Frank Oz, John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi to play the roles of some of the actors. If you haven't seen the version of this film with the out takes and company play, then you should get the DVD when it comes out.","Monsters, Inc."
70,aidanratesmovies,Quite a Delight,10,12 October 2020,"An entertaining, surprisingly sweet, and all together funny animated film- Monsters Inc. more than holds up today, and proves itself to be an animated classic. First off, I adore the cast of this film, honestly one of the best cast of actors out there for a Pixar film to be honest. John Goodman excels at Sully, which is obvious, but the true standouts of the film are Crystal's Mike Wazowski and Buscemi's Randall. The animation is done quite well, and the world they built throughout is absolutely extraordinary and the exact kind of limitless imagination you would expect from such a classic Disney flick. The film is quite funny, and has its fair share of emotional and tender moments, both of which I rather appreciate. It isn't Pixar's best, but due to the talent involved, the incredible worldbuilding, and just a sheer sense of direction and fun characters- Monsters Inc. proves to be one memorable film, and one you never can get tired of, no matter how many times you watch it.

71,questl-18592,Monsters!,7,6 October 2019,"After 18 years, Monsters Inc still holds up, which is impressive for an animated film. The humor still lands, it's still adorable and fun. Boo is a little creepy looking now but aside from that holds up really well.The only thing really holding it back is that it doesn't seem to have a real strong message. Maybe I just missed it, but most Pixar movies have at least one significant message to them and in Monsters Inc I just wasn't getting the same depth to that.","Monsters, Inc."

The story is fun and full of beautiful colors, the animation is obviously great, the world Pixar has created is fully realized and every detail expertly crafted to match the distinct monster city. There's lots of bombastic action with an overall good solid moral message, Monster's Inc. is always a great time, no matter what age your are.","Monsters, Inc."
73,Spleen,"The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult",10,2 January 2002,"Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong.  This is far better.  And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow.  It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful.  What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as ""Monsters, Inc."" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with ""Shrek"" - which emphatically IS a children's movie.  ""Monsters, inc."" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way.  The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls ""Boo"") into the city.  But we never see things from her point of view.  We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species.  And they ARE.  To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship).  This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.""Shrek"", of course, is a children's movie through and through.  Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes.  ""Monsters, Inc."" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children.  This is not to say children won't like it.  Maybe they will. (Who can say?)  Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike ""Shrek"") actually have a beneficial effect.  It will make them less frightened of the dark.","Monsters, Inc."

75,rosscinema,Fun for all ages,7,6 July 2003,"This is another enjoyable animated feature from the Pixar studios and one of the reasons they can entertain a more older audience is the subtle references that they make from other sources. The story is about a world called Monstropolis where monsters live and their world is powered by the heat of childrens screams. Monsters go through doors that lead into the closets of children in the real world and its the monsters job to frighten children so that their scream can be harnessed and used for power. The top scream collector is Sulley (John Goodman) who is a big hairy monster and he works in the factory that builds the doors and where collectors are to pass through. Sulleys best friend is a big walking eyeball named Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and they discover that a human child named Mary and nicknamed Boo (Mary Gibbs) has passed through into Monstropolis and together they try and get her back but the alert has gone out and the monsters of Monstropolis think that humans are toxic and can kill you. Its always fun to watch these films and its because the computer animation that Pixar does is so detailed and intricate. Each hair on Sulley seems to have a life of its own. The stories are engaging as well as they seem to be about simple things that we can all relate to. Monsters waiting in the closet, we have all grown up thinking about these things and its fun to watch these old phobias come to life. One of the subtle references I was talking about is where Mike is eating in a restaurant called ""Harryhausens"". This is of course in reference to the great Ray Harryhausen who is a pioneer in special effects for films. This film also has the Oscar winning song ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Randy Newman and he has become a Pixar staple with his music. Very enjoyable animated feature that has more to offer than just a kids flick. Adults will definitely get a kick out of it as well!","Monsters, Inc."

Before I have watched movies from Pixar like '' The Incredibles'',''Shrek'' or even ''Finding Nemo'', ''Monsters Inc.'' was one of the first movies made by Pixar that I watched and enjoyed a lot! The monsters like Mike and Sulley are charismatic and funny,and the story is very pleasant as well: In the monster's land, the monsters generate their city's power by scaring human children.One of the biggest companies of energy is the famous 'Monsters, Inc', where Mike and James Sullivan work. James is very famous in his work, since he is one of the 'scariest'and the one who produces the bigger amount of energy to the company. One night, however, Sully uncovers a devious plot to rid Monster city of it's power problems but accidentally lets a human little girl to enter the monster world. The funny thing is that the monsters really believes that children can contaminate them, so, everybody is afraid of children, specially the little girl who entered the monster's world. Mike and James call the little girl 'Boo'and after seeing she looks harmless, they try to send her back to her world.

79,Howlin Wolf,"Light, enjoyable fare that proves animation is still on top...",7,9 February 2002,"... when it comes to producing well-rounded, realised and consistently entertaining movies.  Is it just me or have there been no REALLY awful animated films from the stables of the top studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, etc?  The movie industry as a whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that goes into these movies.  Both 'suits' and audiences are sure to benefit if that ever happens.  Long may the tradition of quality animated movies be, I say!   I actually bought a ticket for this last night after finding to my dismay that another premiere, ""From Hell"", was already sold out by the time I arrived.  These are certainly two distinctly different films in theme!  I was slightly grouchy, because, coupled with that minor disappointment, I'd had an argument with a friend on the way over to the theatre, and was now proceeding solo.  I wouldn't say that ""Monsters Inc"" made me glad I missed ""From Hell"", but I still got a solidly entertaining film for my money.  I just hope I don't miss ""Ocean's 11"" next week...   For every plus-point to the movie I can also think of a criticism, but on the whole the good points JUST outweigh the bad.  The setup may be a little too complicated for younger audiences and the supporting cast of voices is wasted.  There was definitely not enough Steve Buscemi, whose bad guy just seemed like an afterthought to all the Keystone Cops esque capers of trying to get ""Boo"" out of Monstropolis.  The script is pitched at a much younger level than ""Toy Story"" was, and so as a result adults may be bowled over by the animation, but slightly starved in the belly-laughs department.  That said, there are still a couple of moments guaranteed to have older patrons guffawing heartily, just not enough for my liking.  Even without laughter, the story is still diverting and inventive enough to fix your attention satisfactorily.  The movie really comes into its own when the kid is introduced, as thereafter the action rarely pauses for breath.   Good as the voice talents of Goodman and Crystal are, it is undoubtedly youngster Mary Gibbs who inadvertently steals the show.  Her cute gurgles and shrieks are enough to put a smile on most people's faces and warm their hearts.  The job the team did on collecting all her voice samples for the finished movie is nothing short of amazing; indeed, just like the animation achievements were as well.  Goodman excels in his voice acting, making ""Sulley"" a truly memorable character.   The animation is wonderful, and at times will make you unable to do anything else but gawp.  Techniques in this arena seem to be moving at lightspeed, and in just a few years will make the graphics seen in ""Toy Story"" seem unremarkable.  Just for this factor alone, ""Monsters Inc."" deserves to be seen, but the likeable (if not always best used) cast and the imaginative plot add an extra dimension that make it worth your time. Nowhere near a ""Toy Story"" beater for sheer polish and appeal to all ages, but a commendable effort nonetheless.  Well done!

80,oneguyrambling,As funny as it is furry...,9,29 November 2010,"In Monstropolis kid's screams are like electricity and power the city. Monsters enter kid's closets through magic doors to harvest pure fear, only kids are becoming less susceptible and power is running low (these kids today, Oi!). A small child mistakenly enters Monstropolis and two monsters must try to help her back to her room unharmed The charm of Monsters Inc is showing big furry behemoths as nice guys just doing their job, even though by necessity some monsters must be nasty and mean. It also makes light of the very ""monster"" concept, meaning hopefully kids assume they are film characters rather than an unseen menace. Sully and Mike are also voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the best ""name"" combination of voice actors since Buzz and Woody cleared their animated throats.Funnier than most films have a right to be, and there is so much detail in every frame that you notice something new each time you watch it.What you hope kids will learn: There is no reason to be afraid of monsters.What they'll take away: Randall the slimy salamander-monster still is.

It was cute, it was fun, it is memorable. The only thing that fell short for me was the very very end, I thought it could have been a bit better, but its not that big of a deal to ""hate"" this gem. John Goodman (Sulllivan)and Billy Crystal (Mike) were wonderful voicing the Monsters who work to get the scares from the kids to keep the city going. Then there's Boo's voice, that is adorable. And who could hate Jennifer Tilly's voice? I had no idea that was Steve Buscemi as the slimy ""Randall"", it was very good.  Add the late James Coburn voice as the boss and more and you have quite a fun family favorite. I watch this film more than I expected because it was more than I expected.

Though not one of Pixar's best and not a personal favourite of mine, I did get a lot of enjoyment out of this movie, especially the characters, which are all brilliantly unique, entertaining and genuinely funny.The storyline, as enjoyable as it is, is not on the same level as the likes of 'Toy Story' and 'Up'. I always get the feeling I'm watching something special with those movies, but I think 'Monsters, Inc.', for all its creativity and likeability, lacks that special quality to put it up there with the very best animated pictures.

You think that it you who's afraid of them but it's actually the other way around. You'll change the way you think of monsters after you see this movie.Monsters Inc. is a Monster run factory in which their Scarers(Monsters who go through closet doors) scare children. Those screams get produced in Scream tanks which would be able to produce into energy for their City Monstropolis.James P. Sullivan aka Sully is the top Scarer.

87,mattymatt4ever,Best for the kiddies,5,20 November 2001,"I have to admit, my main motivation for seeing this film was Billy Crystal. I'm a big fan of his, so when I saw the previews and saw that he was doing the voice of the main character (and I was able to spot Billy's voice in an instant), I said to myself ""I have to see this film.""  Then I found out John Goodman and Steve Buscemi were also doing voices, and I said ""Even better."" That's how you can tell you're getting old:  You're watching animated flicks for the voice-overs...LOL.On the surface, the plot seems creative.  A world populated by monsters, where the sight of a human being scares the heck of them?  Sounds good so far.  But the idea wasn't very well-executed.  Each of the monsters would go through a door, leading to a kid's bedroom, and scare them.  Supposedly, the energy in Monstropolis--where they live--is powered by human screams. That I just found silly.  And I know they were trying to make the grown-ups laugh with such one-liners as ""Kids just don't get scared the way they used to,"" but it just didn't work.  The idea was too silly!  Again, filmmakers undermining the intelligence of young boys and girls.
Throughout the film, I couldn't help but anticipate the next thing Billy Crystal's character would spurt out.  Why?  Because he's Billy!  But he never does say anything terribly funny.  Is it because it's a kid's film? Hell, that didn't stop Robin Williams from cracking us up as the genie in ""Alladin.""  Instead, Crystal does a stupid gag where he was tries to cover up the fact that a kid has invaded Monstropolis by performing and song-and-dance number, ""Put that thing back where you came from.  So help me!  So help me!""  Now, if that were not in a kid's film and let's say that gag was in a live action film where Billy was doing the same song-and-dance number critics and audiences would look at him and say, ""What kind of lame crap is he pulling?""The animation is good, but I think if they're gonna spend a couple years arduously animating a film of this sort, you may as well make sure you have a good, solid idea!  Like ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2.""  I was trying to keep myself awake during part of the film.  It just bored me.  I'm only gonna give in a halfway decent review because of the animation.
My score:  5 (out of 10)","Monsters, Inc."
88,sharky_55,"We Scare, Because We Care",9,29 July 2015,"The world of Monster's Inc. is not unlike our own, but it is scattered with little detailed twists that a monster city would - deodorants that come in an assortment of gross flavours, side- walk grills that become a hazard for unsuspecting slimes, the various shaped body suits of the CDF, even adjusted idioms (""first time I laid eye on you"") ...It's all very convincing and lends credence to the very original and creative premise of Pixar's fourth. The animation holds up well and also helps with the world building; whether it's the 2.3 million individual hairs of Sulley that bounce and bristle with life, or the very complicated sequence of thousands of moving doors that must have been a nightmare to storyboard and coordinate. But it's the characters that really bring Monster's Inc. to life. Monster's University, the sequel more than a decade later, wound back time and placed original characters in a rather by- the-numbers college movie, with the usual jocks and geeks that arise in that genre. In MI, they are less one dimensional and more complex; and the voice acting is equally great. John Goodman brings a jovial and good natured Sulley to the screen, so convincing that its surprisingly scary when he finally bares his teeth and roar, the audience reacting as effectively as Boo does (""I'm off duty""). Billy Crsytal voices Mike, the wise cracking joker and best friend, delivering both juvenile and adult humour, while Steve Buscemi is Randall, the slimy rival scarer that has darker intentions. James Coburn is Waternoose, the well rounded boss who thinks first and foremost for his family's company, but also expresses regret at banishing his favourite scarer. The scene stealer is Boo, played by a infant Mary Gibbs, so young that they had to follow her around the studio and record sound bites which make up her gibberish speech. She's animated with such care and precision - there's a wonderful irony in the way she pops up in Monstropolis and says boo adorably, only to have every scary monster in sight run for their lives. Her and Sulley's relationship make up much of the emotional core of Monster's Inc. and it progresses with remarkable realism and pacing. Goodman exposes the very confines of Sulley's heart, looking beneath the agile and powerful frame that the animation presents. It's a very touching and sometimes funny relationship that develops gradually and begins to even intrude into the long lasting bond that he has with Mike. There's such a poignancy to the way Goodman delivers the line ""Did you see the way she looked at me?"" that conjures up a wealth of subtext about the overall premise of the film, their careers, the ethics of scaring innocent children the growing fatherly role he has adopted for Boo...it's neatly tied up in the ending when they switch to comedy instead of horror (which gives Mike a new-found responsibility and role) and also is much kinder and fun for the kids. The little bits of laughter from Boo and their effects throughout the film foreshadow this nicely. Randy Newman's score is also an important element. The jazzy big band influence is apparent from the opening credits sequence, and also excels in the stand out track The Scare Floor, played in the very first reveal of the elite Scarers making their way into the room and preparing for another day of screaming. The percussion beats build steadily and prepares the audience, while the jazz section swings with a wonderful rhythm that goes well with the hard work and chaos of the scare floor. The award winning is If I Didn't Have You is saccharine and pleasant, if not a little similar to Toy Story's You've Got a Friend In Me, but Goodman and Crystal play off each other well. Monster's Inc. delivers laughs and emotionally rich moments for both children and adults and is another demonstration of Pixar's ability to seamlessly combine the two in a creative and original premise.","Monsters, Inc."

Currently, Sulley is in the #1 position for causing the most screams, but Randall, his chameleon-like rival, is determined to top him! One night, Sulley sees that a toddler girl has come in through one of the doors! Residents of Monstropolis are convinced that human children are poisonous, so Sulley and Mike are scared when they first see her, but she seems harmless, and Sulley grows to like her, giving her the name, ""Boo."" Still, they must try to get her back home before any other monster finds her! There definitely is humour in this movie, but a lot of it is perhaps more amusing for the kids. I personally found a lot of it at least mildly amusing, but overall, I didn't find the movie as funny as I had hoped. We have plenty of the standard slapstick here, but it sometimes seems too simple and childish, and not as funny as I usually find that type of humour. Mike Wazowski is a comic character, with his bitterness and sarcasm, which helps. Claiming he and Sulley are rehearsing a scene for an upcoming company play when their co-workers catch them talking about Boo is a highlight. Overall, I think ""Mike's New Car"", an animated short featuring Mike and Sulley, is slightly funnier than their full-length movie, but for the most part, I guess the humour in ""Monsters, Inc."" is good enough. Maybe funnier for kids, but adults could definitely get their share of laughs as well.Other than humour, this Pixar effort tells a very imaginative story. It may not be the most well written one to ever come from the computer animation company, but still one that obviously took talent and imagination to write. The adventure that the two main characters find themselves on eventually gets quite exciting. As usual with Pixar, the animation is no disappointment, you can basically expect the same kind of great animation and colours here. So, this is not one of Pixar's best, but it is still another job well done from the company. I'm sure ""Monsters, Inc."" has a lot for kids, which is good, since these animated family films are supposed to entertain them, but also has entertainment value for adults as well, even if it's not equal entertainment value for both audiences like it sometimes is.","Monsters, Inc."
91,jhclues,Entertaining Fare for the Whole Family,8,8 November 2001,"At one time or another, every kid in the world goes through the dread Monster-in-the-Closet experience; it's like one of Life's Rules.  And for those who remember the chills of the dark bedroom, the stark terror of the moment the light goes out and you're left all alone with the Thing of your imagination, at long last there are some concrete answers to allay the fears of PCCSS (Post Childhood Closet Stress Syndrome), thanks to the good folks at Pixar.  `Monsters, Inc.,' directed by Peter Docter, and featuring the talents of Billy Crystal and John Goodman, takes you behind the scenes of those haunted hours of childhood and explains the whole business.  Which happens to be the whole point:  It's a business.  At Monsters, Inc., it's the job of all the scariest creatures around to supply the power for the city, which is generated by the screams of the children found on the other side of closet doors.  The bigger the scream, the more power.  From one floor of the factory that is Monsters, Inc., closet doors are affixed, assembly line style, so that the best of the best (or maybe that's the worst of the worst) can step through (it takes them into a child's bedroom) and do their thing.  The screams are then collected in canisters and the city has power.  	The monsters earn points for the most scream power collected, and at the top of the list is James P. `Sulley' Sullivan (Goodman) a big, hairy, hulking monster who is assisted by the one-eyed (and it's a big one) Mike Wazowski (Crystal), a monster in his own right, though not of the scaring kind.  But Sulley has some competition; the number two scarer is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), more sinister than Sulley, and not beyond stooping to some underhanded schemes to get to the top spot on the roster.  It's a tough racket, and Sulley and Mike have no idea just how low Randall is willing to go to get what he wants.  It's a plot, however, that ultimately has a far-reaching effect on the whole city, and it falls to Sulley and Mike to try and put things aright with their world.	Beginning with the premise, the story is clever and funny, and it's all brought to the screen with exemplary execution.  The Pixar process is simply amazing; the depth and dimension of the animation is brilliant and gives new definition to this genre as an art form.  Consider, for example, how very real the expressions and emotions of the characters are conveyed.  That, combined with the fact that the story moves along with an excellent pace and perfect timing, makes for a satisfying and enjoyable time at the movies. 
	Docter also assembled a top notch cast for his project.  In addition to Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi (who are terrific), the cast includes James Coburn (Henry J. Waternoose), Jennifer Tilly (Celia), Bonnie Hunt (Flint), Mary Gibbs (Boo), Bob Peterson (Roz), John Ratzenberger (Yeti), Frank Oz (Fungus), Steve Susskind (Floor Manager), Jeff Pidgeon (Bile), Daniel R. Gerson (Needleman & Smitty) and Sam `Penguin' Black (George).  Entertaining fare the whole family can enjoy, `Monsters, Inc.,' is a real experience for the little ones, and certainly presents something with which the adults in the audience will be able to identify, whether it be a memory from childhood or helping one's own child face the unknown of the Closet-in-the-Dark.  It's a movie that actually offers a little bit more than meets the eye, and it's a demonstration of something I've always said, that it's a kind of magic. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.","Monsters, Inc."

Boring and lame ""adventure"" type story.

The voice actors casting is criminal. Absolutely disgusting.
This movie couldn't be worse even if they would've tried.","Monsters, Inc."
93,Stampsfightclub,Another Pixar masterpiece,9,4 March 2008,"Pixar have earned a glowing reputation over the last two decades by creating heart warming and humorous family films, and Monsters Inc is yet another animated masterpiece.From the great adventures of Woody and Buzz in the Toy Story franchise to The superheroes in The Incredibles, Pixar have become an established company in the film animation industry and this 2001 hit about monsters is one of their best.From director Pete Docter, comes a story about Sully and Mike, two scarer's in the Monsters Inc cooperation who find their world turned upside down when a monstrous child enters their world and their lives.It's a typical family film containing amusing physical humour, none more so than Crystal's (When Harry met Sally) Mike Wazowski. Little girl Boo is a great character for the film so audiences can see the differences between the Monster world (Beautifully named Monstropolus) and the human world.These differences make the film even more humours as the monsters all fear humans, and that in itself is a catalyst.The film moves at the right pace, giving characters their own sub stories to widen the interest.It's a very sweet film, especially towards the end which many people have acclaimed to find very sad.The plot and comedy are consistent, the animation is simply super and is one of Pixar's best ever animations and therefore, a simply must watch for the whole family.","Monsters, Inc."
94,KnightsofNi11,One of Pixar's best,8,11 December 2010,"It's hard to say that anything that comes out of the studios of Disney/Pixar is anything short of genius. In my opinion, the studio has been on a winning streak since their first feature film, Toy Story (1995). Every single one of their films is unforgettable, and Monsters, Inc. shines just as much if not more than some of its partners. Much like Toy Story expanded on the childhood fantasy of toys that talk while you're not looking, Monsters, Inc. expands on a darker fantasy, and that is the infamous fear of the monster in the closet. It's a notion that every child has had once at least once in their lifetime, making this film instantly relateable.Monsters, Inc. is set in the city of Monstropolis, a thriving metropolis inhabited by monsters that come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. The city is powered by screams, and the scariest monsters are in charge of collecting these screams from children in the human world. The protagonists of the film are Sully, the top scarer in the business, and his friend/co-worker Mike Wazowski. The two are a powerhouse duo and Sully is revered for his ability to scare children so well. But problems arise when he accidentally brings a child back from the human world. The story unfolds into something amazingly exciting, clever, and also very heartwarming.Disney/Pixar are renowned for their humorous and cleverly constructed worlds their films are set in, and each of their films always has a great opening sequence to introduce us to these worlds. Monsters, Inc. is one of the best of their openers I think I've ever seen. Every aspect of the city of Monstropolis is a hilarious and yet tasteful pun. There are so many witty things that you can get anything from a good chuckle to a hearty belly laugh out of. Every single aspect of this setting stays true to the theme of this film and there are so many little things to pick up on. You'll always be watching for the next clever joke to be placed in the most unlikely places. Every pun and every joke in this film is very funny, but not over exaggerated, and none of it is hammed up with goofy dialouge or cheesy music. Everything is done with a lot of respect and a lot of wit. It is just what humor needs to be. Sure the occasional fart joke or potty humor is alright, but it can ruin a film if it's too excessive. Thankfully, Monsters, Inc. always knows what levels to take itself to and it never goes overboard.Even after a brilliant opening sequence the film continues to get better with its great story and vibrant cast of characters. Disney/Pixar always manages to pick up some of the most unique talents to do the voice work in their films and they always get the best vocal performances out of these talents. Billy Crystal and John Goodman work amazingly well as a comedic duo. They are perfectly and eccentrically characterized. Billy Crystal in all his nasally hilarity is the zany and bizarre little guy, while John Goodman is the slightly more intelligent straight man, who is much better at keeping his cool. The two characters work together incredibly well, and their routine never gets old. Then there are other amazing talents such as Steve Buscemi, who is perfectly cast as the villain of the film, Randall. He is an odd salamander like monster, so who better to cast that Buscemi, right? No offense of course, I love the guy and everything he does. Of course I was anxiously awaiting Sully to tell Randall that he was out of his element, but unfortunately that never happened. Other stars like James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly show up for some great roles, and of course John Ratzenberger shows up for a scene as the Abominable Snowman. For those who don't know, John Ratzenberger has appeared in every single Disney/Pixar film to date.Disney/Pixar is so consistently great but Monsters, Inc. really stands out as one of their most clever and extraordinarily well made films. The world of Monstropolis is put together so well and it all operates perfectly, with so much attention to detail and an incredible amount of thought put into each and every aspect. The story is a lot of fun and can even bring a tear to the eye, especially when it is voiced by such a fantastic collaboration of actors. I will say that the ending is very kiddy and everything works out a little too perfect for all the characters, but hey, it is a kids film so could you expect anything less. Monsters, Inc. is a fantastic Disney/Pixar adventure.","Monsters, Inc."
95,jon.h.ochiai,Behind the Closet,9,12 November 2001,"Pixar and Disney's ""Monsters, Inc."" is great fun for all.  It was a suprisingly good movie, with a interesting and often touching story by Jill Culton, director Peter Docter, and others.  To their credit along with Peter Docter's direction, the story telling is coherent and entertaining throughout.  John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi are just terrific in their voice roles.  The cutting edge computer animation is awesome.  The idea that monsters scare children at night, to collect power for Monsters, Inc. to power the Monster city is novel.  But kids are getting harder to scare, jaded.  So times are tough for Monsters, Inc.  Sometime  is spent setting up and introducing Monster, Sulley (Goodman), and his bud, Mike (Crystal).  Sulley is a star scarer and his rival is the nasty Randall (Buscemi).  The movie really moves once Boo (a cute Mary Gibbs) enters Monsters, Inc. through her bedroom closet.  Sulley and Mike must get Boo back home.  The relationship between Sulley and Boo works.  MI is sentimental, and has a cute message about  courage and fear.  It does all this in 90 minutes.  Monsters, Inc. is an enjoyable package.","Monsters, Inc."

Two monsters' (John Goodman and Billy Crystal) attempt to break the all-time record for scaring children after dark is halted when a little girl accidentally ends up in their world.Monsters, Inc. is middle-ranking Pixar, enjoyable and achieving technological firsts with its detailed generation of the monsters' furry exteriors, but prone to easy sentiment; up until an inspired finale, the corporate corridors where much of the action takes place also seem too familiar and unimaginative an environment to sustain any visual wonder.","Monsters, Inc."

While Monsters Inc is not great, Disney has succeeded in making a film that is funny, enchanting and kind of thrilling. The chases in this film are very exciting and the characters (the good ones anyway) are all likeable. I especially enjoyed the way they brought Boo on screen. She was very cute. Keep on the good work.

The story created around this power station creating energy from child screams is unique and engaging. The characters is relatable due to the similarity between this work place and those from the real world. Humans are dangerous according to the monsters, but the child Boo accidentally enters their world and is discovered by one of the main characters, Sully, who tries to hide her whilst finding a way to return her to the human world. This makes way for really fun moments in the development of the main conflict in the movie and eventually an emotional core which is both sweet, engaging and real. The movie is great and a must to watch along with the other Pixar greats.","Monsters, Inc."
102,mitsubishizero,Well done,9,27 May 2019,"Another Pixar classic, this one focuses on the world of monsters and how similar their world is to ours in that it's blue-collar. The main characters are Mike(Billy Crystal) and Sully(John Goodman). Sully is a top scarer at his job and loves what he does. You see their world is powered by the screams of kids and it's his job to help maintain the power they receive by scaring kids.However there's a catch: The monsters think kids are toxic and that touching them can be fatal. Isn't that hilarious? It doesn't help that a little girl makes her way into their world and they have to keep her existence a secret. While struggling to get her home they begin to realize that she's not toxic and that there may be a conspiracy involving their rival Randall(Steve Buschemi) and boss Mr. Waternoose.So yeah, the premise's interesting and leads to a lot of creative jokes. A good one is at the beginning where they're walking to work and one of the monsters they walk past is a slug who goes through a filter on the street and another who accidentally burns his newspaper by sneezing fire.The characters are enjoyable to watch. Mike as a comic relief's funny and Sully works well as the straight man. It's funny to see them bounce off each other while also seeing them talk about serious matters like the situation about the little girl nicknamed ""Boo"". Randall's an interesting villain. The way he moves is cool and his design is interesting.Monsters Inc. is a great movie to watch. It has something for everyone both kids and adults. I don't have much else to say other check it out for yourself. It's another Pixar classic.","Monsters, Inc."

107,Igenlode Wordsmith,Not much here for grown-ups,6,3 September 2010,"Coming to this film late (I missed it the first time round) I'm afraid found myself rather underwhelmed. Shorn of the 'wow-look-at-the-fur' novelty rendering factor, what remains is a rather thin piece of slapstick with additional heavy-handed sentiment; the level of humour is distinctly juvenile, epitomised by the 'yellow snow' jokes, and the moral message hammered home with a twenty-foot mallet.Compared to films like ""Wall-E"" or ""The Incredibles"", this has little to offer adult viewers -- the whole lengthy opening sequence revolves around what is basically a single role-reversal concept, that the monsters are in fact terrified of the children they scare, but this idea is worked to death long before we actually start to care about the characters, with resulting tedium. The film picks up in interest later on, but it then descends into a long chase sequence, while I did find the sentimental sequences grated with excessive repetition.'Mike' is a typical Annoying Disney Sidekick of the type I've never cared for, but the little girl is charming (and her pre-verbal sequences conveyed in what amounts to silent film technique, an interesting precursor to the long wordless introductory sequence of ""Up""). Other characters, including Sulley, I found 'all right' but nothing very special.I suppose I'm unduly disappointed in the film because Pixar have established the boundaries of expectation so high; but this picture is to ""The Incredibles"" as ""Flushed Away"" is to ""Chicken Run"" -- for an Oscar-winning Pixar animation, it was rather more generic and less inspired than I was hoping for.","Monsters, Inc."
108,Mightyzebra,Not my favourite Pixar...,7,31 March 2008,"There are things I do like about this film. I find some moments incredibly beautiful (such as one bit at the end), I like the selection of actors for voicing the characters (especially Randall), I like the CGI used and there are quite a few very good jokes. However, I just feel this is ""weaker"" than a few other Pixar films, such as Toy Story 2, Ratatouille, Cars and of course, Finding Nemo. I also find this a little bit too fast paced, for most of the film there is constant tension. Despite this, I do think that this film is well worth watching at least once and entertaining enough.The plot is pretty easy to follow. The whole film is about monsters who scare human children at night, coming from the closet. As the film goes on and the plot unravels, we meet Sulley and Mike, two monsters who help each other in this scaring business. We then find out the monsters do it because they it helps power their world (like electricity and batteries do to ours). Soon a large adventure follows involving Boo...I recommend this to children who do not mind constant tension and worry in animated films and for people who like other Pixar films. Enjoy! :-)","Monsters, Inc."
109,Movie-12,"Colorful images and great imagination, but one heck of an annoying character. *** (out of four)",7,18 November 2001,"MONSTERS, INC. / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:When I was a kid, I imagined a world of monsters just like the one in ""Monsters, Inc."" I dreamed of a magical kingdom full of strange, menacing creatures. Creatures that waited anxiously for bedrooms to darken at night so they could jump out of closets and scare unsuspecting children. Alone in my darkened bedroom, surrounded by complete and utter silence, I heard lots of strange noises. When I noticed something unusual, like a sudden squeak or a shadow on the wall, it wasn't uncommon for me to pull the covers over my head. Heck, don't tell anybody, but I still do that today.  
Children will remember the characters of this film long after they see it. Expect to hear comments about monsters in the closet weeks after they see it. But their remarks will not come out of terror, but out of pure joy. The Academy Award-winning creators of ""Toy Story"" give us a new, pleasing insight on monsters. It turns what was once a motif for terror into an imaginative realm of entertaining delight.This computer animated production represents the most advanced technology of Disney and Pixar, the highly acclaimed team behind such family gems as ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Toy Story 2."" From its convincing depiction of monster fur, to the realistic shadowing, lighting, and movement, the filmmakers pay close attention to the even the slightest details. The story revolves around a massive corporation where all kinds of monsters reside. It's called Monsters, Inc., the biggest scream processing factory in the monster world. Set in Monstropolis, the main power source of the city is the collected screams of human children. We meet a hairy blue creature named Sully (voiced by John Goodman), and his friend, roommate, and assistant, Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). These guys are the best scream producers ever, much to the dismay of Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a creepy, lizard monster who will stop at nothing to claim their coveted standing. One day, Sully accidentally allows a human child to enter the monster world. To complicate matters, human children are said to be highly toxic to monsters and should be avoided at all costs. Sully quickly finds his career in jeopardy and his life in total chaos. When Mike enters the situation, the two uncover a scandal at Monsters, Inc. that will place their very lives in jeopardy. ""Monsters, Inc."" works rather well until it introduces this annoying little girl as a plot device. I know I am being excessively critical here, and I know that my personal hatred for whiny, giggly, squirmy infants seized me over. Some audiences will find this character absolutely adorable, maybe even as the film's most distinguished. Though for me, this character almost destroyed the entire movie.  I understand the need for a child to enter Monstropolis, but why couldn't the film have had fun with the idea. Perhaps it could have used a child old enough to understand his circumstances, but young enough to delight in the wonder of his newly discovered world. Instead, the movie gives us a nonsensical plot in which the infant gets herself into one problematic situation after another. This has worked before. In ""Baby's Day Out"" we laughed at the accidental irony of the situations. Here, the character gets herself into these situations. She becomes a nuisance even as she initially appears on screen. There is nothing innovative or creative with a young girl running in and out of rooms, yet ""Monsters, Inc."" insists it's funny. The film becomes a one-joke comedy. If you're old enough to cross the street by yourself, you're probably too sophisticated for this humor. Despite this parasite of a character, ""Monsters, Inc."" still manages to come out of the one-joke routine and display a third act of climbing excitement, surprising twists, and entertaining action that will amuse children of all ages. If not for the pesky little girl, this movie might have been one of the most colorfully creative films of the year. All though it is not, ""Monsters, Inc."" does contain enough imagination and colorful images to warrant a trip to the multiplex. But don't say I didn't warn you about the kids. During the screening I attended, jam-packed with children running all around and making noise, I had a little boy sitting behind me that kept kicking my seat. Now that's something I never want to see coming out of my closet.","Monsters, Inc."
110,sashank_kini-1,"Short of winning the academy award for best animated feature, yet a great movie",9,30 May 2007,"Disney makes films which give us happiness and warmth while Pixar gives us terrific animation. Together, they form a multi-billionaire industry making terrific films which the audience and the critics love to watch. And this is one of them.Monsters Inc. has a very odd and different plot. Monsters scare children to provide electricity by collecting the children's screams but they are scared of the children themselves are they think that they would get contaminated by touching them. Sullivan is the best scarer of the company Monsters Inc. and he, together with his best friend Mike, work as the best employees in Monsters Inc. But then when Sullivan leaves the door to the children's room open by mistake, he invites an unwelcoming guest, a small, terribly cute girl called Boo. And then the world goes upside down.A team of monsters are in search of the girl while Mike and Sullivan try to rescue the girl by sending her back to the door where she came from.But then they come to know that their own boss is involved with their rival and they try to stop them from taking the child by putting in all their effort and strength.Now, after this summary, let me tell you some of the good points of the movie:1) Excellent animation. Monsters are not shown scary and so it is a movie for all. Even the young toddlers would fall in love with the monsters.2) Boo is too cute and I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. She was not shown too stupid and so her role fitted well in the movie.3) Sullivan's voicing was great and I felt touched when he fought for Boo.4) The yeti was really funny in the short role he had got. It was good to see that they showed Himalayas and didn't stick to one place only.5) Mike was really funny and his voicing was almost perfect.6) The plot is very different and not the same monotonous type.Now, there were some bad points in the movie:1) Celia's voicing was done badly. Her voice could have been better.2) I found it stupid when they showed that Sullivan's boss wanted to kidnap all children and this was his motive. It was very stupid to show that this was the reason that he was bad.3) Roz's voice made me almost doze off.

You couldn't ask for anyone better and little Boo was just *so* lovely and cute. Monsters, Inc. is one of the best animated movies I've seen and I'm not surprised that it's doing so well.

115,meydiana-65242,"The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult",10,10 December 2020,"Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation. All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could. ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong. This is far better. And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow. It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful. What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as ""Monsters, Inc."" as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with ""Shrek"" - which emphatically IS a children's movie. ""Monsters, inc."" is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way. The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls ""Boo"") into the city. But we never see things from her point of view. We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species. And they ARE. To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship). This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.""Shrek"", of course, is a children's movie through and through. Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes. ""Monsters, Inc."" has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children. This is not to say children won't like it. Maybe they will. (Who can say?) Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike ""Shrek"") actually have a beneficial effect. It will make them less frightened of the dark.","Monsters, Inc."

117,EmperorNortonII,A Real Scream!,9,2 December 2001,"The Pixar animation company is very good at what they do.  They always manage to keep up with the development of computer animation.  And their latest masterpiece, ""Monsters, Inc.,"" shows you how far they have come, and how excellent they are.  This movie had a lot of laughs, and a few tender moments as well.  It put a nice twist on an old childhood fear: what if the monster in your closet was afraid of you?  I enjoyed a lot of in-jokes, including the use of animation legend Ray Harryhausen's name.  The best character would have to be Randall, whose reptilian moves and chameleon color changing style were very well done.  Pixar did the right thing by not including a ""blooper reel"" in the closing credits.  Otherwise, they would have looked like they were trying to be like ""A Bug's Life.""  Anyway, ""Monsters, Inc."" has left me satisfied, and eagerly awaiting their next work of digital art!","Monsters, Inc."
118,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: good but not ""Toy Story""",7,1 April 2002,"""Monsters, Inc."" is a solid animated comedy that will be great for kids, and acceptable for adults. Mostly, I think that Billy Crystal needs to find a more funny and less annoying schtick. Ever since Abbott and Costello there have been teams with a big straight-man problem fixer and a short, annoying but lovable troublemaker who talks too much. It doesn't work nearly as well here as in ""Ice Age"", although it comes nowhere as low as Jar Jar Binks territory (""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"").Despite all that, and the sort of generic plotting you expect in kids films nowadays (if you're over 30, aren't Disney flicks all starting to look alike to you?), I enjoyed it and can recommend it also to adults.Who should see this film:-- Kids (and their parents will have fun, too)-- Comedy lovers who've already seen ""Toy Story"" or ""Antz"",and don't mind seeing a kids film from time to time.I'll give ""Monsters, Inc."" a 7 out of 10.","Monsters, Inc."

120,braddugg,One of my favourite movies ever and even today I love it more.,10,8 September 2014,"One of my favourite movies ever and even today I love it more.It's about something that is cute more than something that is required. We have most of things in our movies but here is a story who loves a kid, who indeed misses his the kids little things. The story is set in a Monster city where Monsters have to make kids cry or scare them rather. The scared kids screams produce energy that shall be used in the city. The premise of any PIXAR film, till I think UP was just so beautiful and nice till something went wrong. OK, so this movie has something that is cut and that is the little kid called ""BOO"" I love her so much and each time I see this, I love her more. The animation is wonderful here especially for her. And for me BOO is the cutest kid ever seen on a film.The animation quality of PIXAR is outstanding, from the hairs of James P Sullivan to the setup of the doors to the whole Monsters world, it is too very detailed and amazing. I wish I could see this in theatre but alas I couldn't. The characters are superb and if Mike Wozawski is comical then, Randall, the dragon is cunning and a dastardly villain. At the bottom of this movie, like in most other PIXAR movies is an underline text and that is a father-daughter relationship. Sullivan becomes the father who starts taking care of BOO. This very care and what he actually misses when BOO is not around or what he loves about BOO makes the crux to an extent. Thanks to the PIXAR team for giving such a wonderful film that can be shown for generations of Kids and most kids love it I hope. A 5/5 for this.","Monsters, Inc."
121,dilipbts,"Monster, inc.",8,29 April 2020,"You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in 'Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great 'Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic. I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in 'Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets. It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today's letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel 'Animal Farm' for political and sociological levels of meaning. For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature 'For the Birds' -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock's memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.The short trailer for 'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.'Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.","Monsters, Inc."
122,bheadher,Marvelously entertaining...,10,29 July 2012,"There are some very good reviews here already, just thought I'd add my two cents worth. I was surprised to find out how many creative pains went into the making of Monsters, Inc. I suppose that is a necessity to get a movie ""just right"", and this one does! Monsters, Inc is a cartoon certainly, but even if you don't like cartoons you can immerse yourself in the character's antics. I do like classic cartoons, not the modern clap trap they show now, and this movie just tickles every emotion you can think of...in an entirely intelligent way at that. I watch this one every time it shows on TV. Heck, I even find myself watching it when there is a competing movie on in my favorite genre, Scifi!!!","Monsters, Inc."

125,departed07,The Laughs keep on coming,10,18 March 2005,"Though I slept on the couch throughout my life, I never really experienced sleeping in my own bed until I got older; and yet, I never figured out if monsters ever lived in my closet or better yet, wondered why there would be a monster in my closet? Monsters, Inc. is about a company in Monstorpolis City (hence the title) that has monsters to scare kids as a way of their energy of keeping the city alive. It's very amusing that they show the monsters in a room where they would have different doors leading to a room in different parts of the human world. The world's top scarer is James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) who is known to friends, family and fans as Sulley. His assistant is the little one-eyed green ball Mike Wasizoki (Billy Crystal) in which they are partners no matter what (like Shrek and Donkey). Sulley's competitor is Randall Wallace (no relation to the director and is voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do anything to win and be number one.The rule that Monsters, Inc. has is not to get into contact or let a child touch them. In one scene during the big scream fest, a big blue monster screams out of a closet crying saying that the child wasn't scared and that it touched him. The other monster replies, ""She was only six!"" When Randall tries to cheat in the competition while every monster is away, Sulley sees a door with flowers on it and opens the door. He hears someone messing with his tail and sees a little girl playing with it. Sully does not scare her, but he's reaction lead into a chase where this time it's the other way around; the little girl is chasing the monster. The city finds out that there's a little girl on the run and afraid that they'll get a disease from the child. Though the film is a buddy picture, the main characters are the little girl (Boo) and Sulley as he watches over her making sure that she doesn't get hurt. Most people would consider ""Shrek"" a better cartoon because of its cruelness and ethnicity, but I also like ""Monsters, Inc."" because it's cute in a way of curiosity and realizing that monsters have lives too.","Monsters, Inc."

All those Disney films that have been all the rave for decades, they're pretty hit or miss for me. Even the ones that people say they're the best, I've never been so crazy about them.But Pixar is a whole new ballpark. It has truly changed the game, not just with computer animation, but the quality is really a level up from what we've seen before. They're not all masterpieces, but the vast majority of them are very good. And MONSTERS, INC. is one of their best. It's not just for kids; everyone will enjoy this fun movie.

130,baileycrawly,Phenomenal,9,28 November 2020,"I grew up watching Monsters, Inc., and I think I liked it a lot more than i liked Toy Story (and I really liked Toy Story).There was always something so different about Monsters, Inc. that sets it apart. At its heart, it's a story that explores the pain of being separated from the ones we love, and it does it in such a subtle and steady-paced way that it's almost easy to miss the fact that the message is even there. It's so smoothly executed that every scene runs together like a nice, big painting.Billy Crystal and John Goodman are fantastic as Mike and Sulley respectively. The characters work off each other well, and a lot of the humour in the film comes from the interactions between the two rather than the external factors that are introduced.As is typical with Pixar, this film serves a technological purpose. It's not a story that was told simply because the studio wanted to tell another story to make some money. This film takes everything that worked from its predecessors, adds its own elements and challenges and still somehow manages to create an entertaining and endearing film that never fails to warm and break hearts. It's a rare gift, and I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to grow up with this film.","Monsters, Inc."
131,chrisbrown6453,I always knew there were monsters under my bed!,9,12 June 2002,"`Monsters, Inc."" is the latest full length computer animated feature from Pixar and Disney, the team that practically launched the genre back in 1995 with ""Toy Story."" That film was inspired by one common childhood fantasy (that your toys come to life when your not looking), and this is inspired by another: that there really is a monster under the bed or in the closet. However the monsters in this movie are in fact just regular working Joes from ""Monsters, Inc."" the company that supplies power to their home world by capturing childrens screams. As soon as thats done they nip back home via the portal that exists behind every closet door in the world. The companys most successful child scarer is the huge blue and furry James P ""Sully"" Sullivan (voiced by the suitably robust but tender John Goodman), whose partner is the walking, talking, smart mouthed eyeball Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). However their lives are thrown into chaos the Sully inadvertadly brings a small girl back with him.This time round John Lassiter  Pixars head honcho, driving force and director of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bugs Life"" and ""Toy Story 2""  has taken more of a back seat role, handing the directorial reins over to a duo who have both worked on Pixars other titles. However youd hardly notice; the film has the CGI sheen and spectacular action scenes weve come to expect, along with a plethora of visual gags & in jokes (including tips of the hat to Pixars previous movies), and a razor sharp script that will once again ensure the film appeals to adults as much as kids. DreamWorks may have taken Pixars place as Hollywoods preeminent CGI filmmakers for a while last year, but as good as ""Shrek"" was, ""Monsters, Inc."" is better!","Monsters, Inc."
132,estreet-eva,Underrated among the Pixar offerings.,9,6 December 2011,"""Monsters, Inc."" is among Pixar's best because it constructs a clever, convincing world from the single childhood experience of being afraid of what lies behind the closet door. Pixar opens that door and plunges the viewer into a funhouse mirror of society with puns, inside jokes and pop cultural references (""Scare Different""). Goodman, as his name implies, was an excellent job as the voice actor for the talented but naïve Sully and Buscemi oozes menace as his foil. The plot is sufficiently frightening to drive the story forward and the laughs are high-brow enough for adults and slapstick enough for the kids. In short, one of the few DVDs actually worth owning.","Monsters, Inc."
133,bsinc,Pixar has done it again,9,5 May 2002,"This movie lived up to its expectations. With great ease, I might add. It is slightly different from previous Pixar movies, the fact that it wasn't directed by John Lasseter might have something to do with it:), because I felt that there was less of that universal humor that anyone, be it a 5 year old child or an adult can find funny. But the lack of humor was replaced with a truly touching story and one of the best movie climaxes I have seen in a long time. I also thought that the very, very ending of the movie is nothing less than perfect and I left the cinema with a desire to see the movie again. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great choices for the main characters, but they could have done more with Steve Buscemi's character, if for anything because he has a very distinctive and likable voice. A great story, nice characters and THE perfect ending make ""Monsters, Inc"" a great movie experience.         Can't wait for the next one.                 9/10","Monsters, Inc."

The world they created is without par, extremely imaginative and full of details, and that's without mentioning the mechanics it uses to get energy, as well as the energy crisis within.Each monster is well thought, wild in design, and nicely rendered. The colors are great, vivid, and cheerful. The humor is plenty, side splitting, and almost non-stop. The jokes are great, and the dialogs complete, natural, and logical.The only negative thing I could say is that the ""evil"" part of the scenario was a little unimaginative, but fortunately, it's not the main attraction.

135,lagudafuad,i cant count how many times i have watched this flick,8,27 December 2012,"Nothing warms me more for laughs than anytime I get to sit down and watch Monster's Inc. This is one Pixar animation that I hold dear to heart, I loved it so much that I didn't desire for them to make a sequel, because I felt they will wreck what is already a masterpiece. This is the best voice casting I have seen in any animation, the story of Monster's Inc. is just warm to the heart, as we follow the adventures of a little girl in the monster world. You just can't forget the voices of the top scarer James P. Sullivan aka Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assistant, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).The idea for the Monster's Inc. story was born during a lunch in 1994 between Pixars production team of John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during the production of Toy Story (1995). Pete Docter thought it up, and after they were done working on Toy Story, he stepped aside to build the story, while others were working on other Disney/Pixar animations. When he was done with the first draft (which was far different from the final film) the name Monster's Inc was pitched in by longtime Disney animator Joe Grant (who worked on the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs).The movie plot underwent numerous changes over its writing and production years between 1996 and 2000. Its final story is about how monsters scare human kids to get their screams. The screams are then stored, refined and used as power, power in the sense of electrical power and fuel power. The flip side of this is that monsters are afraid of human kids, because they are believed to be toxic and one touch from a human child can kill them. There is a company in charge of this scream collection and refinement in Monstroplolis, that company is Monster's Inc. There in Monster's Inc our lead Characters are Sulley and Mike, Sulley is the top sacrer and Mike is his assistant.One faithful working day, the lives of both Sulley and Mike would change and the faith of the monster world also, as Sulley meet a human child (Boo) in their scare floor in the Monster's Inc factory, panic broke loose and Sulley not knowing what to do and how to contain the problem allowed it to escalate to the point that all Monstroplois is aware of the existence of a human child in the monster world and the whole monster world is in a state of panic.Monsters, Inc. won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and it lost the Best animated feature award to Dreamworks Shrek. It was a financial success and it received high positive reviews and it is a must watch.A sequel to this wonderful movie is set to be released 12 years after the first, in 2013, and it will be a prequel to the original plot.www.lagsreviews.com","Monsters, Inc."

Sullivan (John Goodman) is one of its top scarers. Sullivan is a huge, intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant, best friend and roommate is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a green, opinionated, feisty little one-eyed monster. Visiting from the human world is Boo (Mary Gibbs), a tiny girl who goes where no human has ever gone before.This movie is a definitive representation of Pixar Standard, back in their golden age. I am confident it will become an animated classic, and rightfully so. It is rare for a movie to come out that is so original, creative and imaginative. The voice acting is amazing, especially from Crystal and Goodman. The animation is great. My main flaw with the movie is how awful the plot is.It's a paper thin plot that features way too many 'twists and turns' to make it interesting. I don't know a SINGLE person who says they were interested by the plot of this movie. I don't. My adoration for this film stems from the colourful characters, not an overly complicated plot about power shortages. Two things that are kinda plot related that I do like, however, are are the climax and the final scene of the movie. The climax for this movie is an insanely fun ride and it is just so creative in how it is handled. Then the final scene of this movie. I mean damn it is a punch to the stomach. I'm not spoiling anything but I mean, damn Pixar. Why. Don't do this to me.As far as performances go, this movie is very strong. Billy Crystal gives one of my favourite Pixar performances as Mike Wazowski and is the standout of this film. He is consistently funny and Crystal showed some impressive range in emotion delivered. John Goodman is also excellent as Sully and provided as strong, authoritative presence to the role. Steve Buscemi is great as Randall and makes him one of my favourite Pixar villains, easily. James Coburn was alright as Waterloose but I really did not find his character interesting in the slightest. The design on him was amazing though. Boo is a cute character and serves her purpose so I can't really praise nor fault her. For the time of this film's release, the animation is exceptional. Seriously, it looks fantastic for the time. I absolutely love the character design for all the characters. Each and everyone is unique and hints at the characters personality without requiring them to speak much at all. One minor flaw with the animation is that Boo looks like a plastic doll. She doesn't look human at all. I understand there were limitations at the time but it is sill a flaw. It is a well shot and edited movie. Comedy wise, this is probably one of Pixar's funniest. The humour is genuinely good and that primarily comes down to Crystal's impressive performance and vocal talent. As far as emotional payoff goes, this movie also succeeds. The last scene is all I need to refer to because that scene is Pixar punching me in the stomach continuously. It is very well done.This movie is a prime example of what Pixar is capable of. It is funny with good emotional payoff, it has great animation, great vocal performances and a fantastic premise. It truly is an exceptional movie. I'll rate Monsters Inc 9 Googlybears out of 10!","Monsters, Inc."

144,Mort-31,Animation becomes ordinary,7,7 May 2002,"Whereas much of the success of films like `Toy Story' or `A Bug's Life' is a result of the fact that the phenomenon of entire computer animation was a fairly new genre, now gradually this plus gets lost. More and more frequently, computer animated movies about various cute creatures are made and audiences aren't surprised any more about the endless possibilities of computer techniques. Moreover, I believe that with `Shrek', the genre already reached its climax as well as its ironic turn. What could follow?`Monsters, Inc.' provides less laughs than `Shrek', it doesn't have the sensational character of former computer animation features. Of course the monster world and its population are nice and imaginative, but the story started off a little too complicated. It is becoming harder and harder to fulfil the task of creating `human' situations in a world of non-humans, so the basic structures are getting more and more far-fetched. However, there were some surprising features, especially towards the end, which made this (children's) film something special, also for adults: the ice sequence for instance, and that magnificent door-machine. All in all, not more than a lovely evening at the movies.","Monsters, Inc."

146,nickmesafilms,"Monsters, Inc, (2001) - I'm So Scared! There's a Monster in the Closet!",10,9 July 2011,"Pixar comes back with a new and improved feature, and this time, there are talking monsters that scare kids, because it's their job, so they can heal their city. I thought the story was perfectly well-written, the laughs are meant to be good laughs, and the cast including John Goodman as Sulley and the incredible Billy Crystal as Mike was perfectly hilarious. The movie is set in a city filled with monsters, and their every-day job is to scare kids through their closet door, in the human world, only to fuel their city with power. But, when a human child enters the monster world, everybody freaks out, and it's up to Mike and Sulley to bring this little girl, with the name of ""Boo"", back home, before ending up in the clutches of the evil chameleon monster Randall. Actually, ""Monsters, Inc."" happens to be my personal favorite Pixar movie. Because the story was well entertaining, but not as entertaining as ""Toy Story"" or ""Nemo"", but well talented at entertainment and laughs. There was actually something that occurred to me that the story was talking about being scared for nothing, because the monsters overreact that kids are dangerous and toxic, and I think it's all in their heads. I think that's a story I'm well impressed at. Wow, I better hurry before a monster pops out in my closet, and scare the hell out of me! ""Monsters, Inc."", in my review, ""entertaining genius, and a unique favorite of mine"".","Monsters, Inc."
147,La Gremlin,Adorable,8,30 January 2002,"I have to be honest with you.  At this point, Pixar Studios could make a movie about a guy reading a phone book and I'd go.  They seem to be the last animation studio these days that has FUN animating.  There appears to be an unwritten rule now that you have to take animation way too seriously.  God forbid you have fun making cartoons, right?Okay, end of mini-rant.  Now, while ""Monsters Inc."" isn't as downright *perfect* as the ""Toy Story"" movies, it's very close.  It's about on par with ""A Bug's Life"".  And with all that said, I have to say that this is one of the most charming and imaginative movies of the year.  The visuals are particularly amazing (the chameleonic Randall is a stunner, and check out the great lost visual gag from ""Terminator 2"" towards the climax), so expect this to become a huge cult hit on video.","Monsters, Inc."
148,Puroo,Pixar did it again,9,20 August 2021,"My first ever exposure to Monsters, Inc. Was when we had gone to McDonald's and I got a Mike Wazowski toy. I was really scared of it, and my sister used to often scare me with it. Little did I know that Mike is supposed to be the comic relief of the movie. Later on I saw the trailer, and eventually the whole movie. And now I can say with a guarantee that Monsters Inc is one of the better Disney movies. Sure there are some things I didn't like (which I will talk about later) but other than those things, this is absolutely perfect.One thing I really like about Pixar is that they always take one thing we like from our lives and then expand it into a full blown story. You play with toys? There's Toy Story. You like fishes and the ocean? There's Finding Nemo. You like cars? There's...well, Cars. So similarly over here we were all afraid of monsters coming into our rooms when we were sleeping alone as kids, and that's what this movie is based on. Unlike the conventional monsters who want to kill us, these monsters are working for a power company who just use children's screams for powering up their world.The story revolves around Sullivan and his best friend Mike Wazowski, who work at Monsters, Inc. Sully is a professional scarer while Mike collects the screams from the children. However, there is one rule that the monsters must abide by - children should not learn about their world otherwise they will no longer be scared and the monster world will run out of energy. Things go down very badly when Mike and Sully find out that Sully accidentally brought a little girl named Boo back to their world. Meanwhile Randall, the second best scarer and Sully's rival, is making a scream extractor which will help him extract the most screams and make him the best employee.The movie is twenty years old and still the world shown here is very dynamic even by today's standards. The third act where Sully, Mike, Boo and Randall are jumping from one door to another was very cool. The animation is also very good, especially the fact that every single hair on Sully's body is distinguishable, and all the pores on Randall's body can be seen. The comic timing is also great, like the part where Randall says, ""Say hello to my scream extractor!"" and Mike immediately says ""Hello."". And also the part where Sully thinks Boo got crushed so he faints just as the emotional music starts playing.Now like I said, there are a couple of things I didn't like in this movie, which is what stopped me from giving it a perfect score. First of all I really liked Randall. He was my favourite character in the whole movie. He looks cool, his superpowers are admirable and he's stronger than he looks. But he still loses to humans. First with Boo, who is literally a child who can't even speak. And then by grown humans who beat him with a broom in the end. It would have been better if he got stuck in the middle of nowhere like he made Sully and Mike do so. And the second thing is the part where they are in Nepal. That was boring to say the least.Monsters, Inc. Is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. It is very rare for a Disney movie to be that way nowadays, so it can be revisited back even today. Like I said, its animation has aged very well, which is why it is so much fun to watch it without feeling something is off. And it has a sequel too, something it took me too long to learn about. I really liked it compared to most movies Disney has been making nowadays.","Monsters, Inc."
149,Hunky Stud,"funny, but meaningless.",6,5 April 2002,"I just saw the movie. it is funny, but it is very meaningless. You can guess the ending before it even ends. it is a good movie if you just want to relax and have some laugh. however, when it ends, you would even have anything to talk about.That is just my opinion.","Monsters, Inc."
150,bix171,Pixar's Expanding Vision,10,1 February 2002,"Every bit the equal of the `Toy Story' films but with larger vision, Pixar continues to explore the universal endearments of childhood; rather than have toys come to life, this time it's about the monsters that come out of the closet at night. Pixar's focus is not about scaring children but about the act of scaring children: it's a job to the main characters, portrayed as working-class stiffs trying to meet their quotas at an energy supply corporation that uses the kids' screams to produce power. It's a brilliant concept, naturally, but Pixar takes it further by creating a fully realized metropolis that exists as a sort of cross between the New York of the forties and the big city in any Marvel Comic, inhabited with pleasingly shaped creatures that complement the ambience and sleek lines of the settings. As in the `Toy Story' series there's as much for grownups as for children and repeated viewings seem almost mandatory (an inviting prospect); but this time around, there's a healthy skepticism towards corporations that's clearly adult. Another winner from Pixar/Disney.","Monsters, Inc."

Cars 2 and Brave have been getting mixed reviews. While I think they are decent movies I do agree that they could have been better. However my favorite pixar film is not Toy Story Or Finding Nemo it is Monsters Inc.The film follows Sulley voiced by John Goodman and Mike voiced by Billy Crystal as they work a 9 to 5 job scaring children. One day a child they name Boo voiced by Mary Gibbs escapes to the monster world which could not only cost Sulley and Mike their jobs but could be deadly to the Monster world.This is an imaginative and fun film with gorgeous animation and very funny and talented writing.

This one of the better Disney movies out there in my opinion.,"Monsters, Inc."
153,Silverzero,"Enjoyable well created compu-toon. Some flaws, but still highly entertaining",6,7 February 2003,"The latest compu-toon from the Big Mouse is a highly entertaining one, which is a step further in computer animation. Released about the same time as Dreamwork's `Shrek' and 20th Century Fox's `Ice Age', this proves that Disney is still as strong as it was 60+ years ago.The story is set in Monstropolis as big-time scarer Sulley and his one eyed friend Mike work for Mr. WaterNoose at Monsters Incorporated. They use children's screams to produce electricity for the city. But when a human child accidentally gets into Monstropolis, Mike and Sulley must try to get it back into the real world, all while avoiding rival monster Randell.As you can see, it's very imaginative and has a fresh concept. For the most part, the vocal talent is very good. John Goodman is easily recognisable and suitable as the big monster, Sulley. Billy Crystal is really good as well and his cynical, sarcastic sense of humour helps liven up the film and give it a sharper edge. Jennifer Tilly is also good as love interest Celia and has great chemistry with the rest of the characters. The only one who didn't work for me was Steve Buscemi as the film's villain. He seemed inappropriate for the part and didn't have enough characteristics to be evil enough, mind you he does get a good come-upance.One of the film's main flaws was its style of humour. Much of it is based on the monsters over-reacting to very mild situations. This is OK in small doses, but it's been cropping up in many Disney films as of late. But the character humour helps make up for this. Some scenes in the film are a bit sugary and bring down the film's momentum. Most of those scenes between Sulley and Boo will be a letdown for adults. But the stunning visuals and good script should make up for these flaws. It lacks the dry wit and consistent entertainment of non Disney films such as the PG rated `Antz' and `Shrek', and the overall shape of the similarly themed `Ice Age', but it's imaginative, creative and a very welcome addition from Disney. By about an eyelash, it's the least of the three compu-toons released almost simultaneously but it's an excellent movie for children and adults alike. 7.6 out of 10.","Monsters, Inc."

156,squirrel_burst,Wonderful animated film for adults and children,10,1 April 2015,"""Monsters Inc."" isn't only a film that will delight kids; it's got big laughs for adults too. What I love about this movie most of all is the truly original premise. This world where monsters are real and they power up their cities by bottling up the screams of frightened children is wonderfully inventive and it lends itself to some incredibly creative character designs. It's all so well animated that you might just forget that what you're seeing on the screen isn't live action footage (particularly the scenes involving snow). Another particularly strong element in my opinion is the voice casting. The voices match the monsters so well that the models must have been modified or done after the recordings were done to match the voices, mannerisms and dialogue so well. Either that or we've got some incredibly dedicated, intelligent and talented individuals with an incredible amount of forethought behind the scenes at Pixar.It's sweet and funny, with just that right sprinkle of heart and at times very thrilling too. One chase scene involving doors (you know what I mean if you've seen the movie) in particular always gets me excited and I never get tired of gushing over how wonderfully original it is. It's filled with characters and moments with Mike (Billy Crystal), Sully (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs) that your heart would have to be made of stone not to enjoy it. Every time I watch this movie I catch some new gag in the background or some new detail I've overlooked in the past, meaning it's got great re-watch value as well. You'll always find something interesting to look at (though you'll have to be familiar with the story to be able to pull your eyes away from the main action).This is the kind of movie that you call a ""family"" film because anyone can watch ""Monsters, Inc."" and instantly fall in love with it. When you watch it with other people, it makes you feel like your enjoyment of the movie is bringing you all closer together. It's so great and smart and funny that you'll have a terrific time watching it over and over. (On DVD, October 27, 2012)","Monsters, Inc."
157,adampkalb,"We should all make children laugh instead of scream. Not only will it help them sleep easier, it will also spare us the guilt of traumatizing a kid in the night.",10,26 June 2020,"In Monsters Incorporated, we see the whole company behind monsters that scare children by coming out of their closets. These are magic doors made by monsters to enter any closet door in the world! However, they should avoid scaring teenagers and adults who are too old to be scared by monsters, or who could expose the monster world and put them out of business (if Monsters University did not already give you that hint). After working their way up from the mailroom for about 3 1/2 years (they were expelled from Monsters U. for Sulley cheating at the Scare Games and Mike trespassing into a test door and both of them later destroying it with too much scare energy from adults), Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan have become the top scarer team at Monsters Inc. for 11 months straight. Just like how every plane needs a co-pilot, every scarer needs an assistant. When Sulley, Randall and George go in to scare the children and rack up their scare numbers, Mike, Fungus and Charlie need to wear the hard hats and keep the doors in control, and bring the doors in and out for them to scare the kids and power the city.One crucial thing I always missed hearing about Monsters Inc before is that there is a shortage of screams, which is why Randall works in cahoots with Waternoose to kidnap children, and Randall leaves behind one door after hours. A human kid escapes, and Sullivan and Mike need to help her get back to her home before Henry Waternoose or Randall Boggs catch them, but it is tough for them to even stand in her presence without anyone else seeing them because monsters are trained to be scared of human kids since they could be sick and give you cooties, and the girl cried when Sulley wouldn't let her have Mike's monster teddy bear, which messed with the lights. That is why the toxic glow-blow urchins were used as a stand-in for kids' toys in dark in Monsters U. Randall makes a scream extractor to help him cheat his way up the scare scores without putting in any effort to scare children, and it is so scary because it sucks out your voice until you are too exhausted to breathe. It even took the color out of Jeff Fungus after Sulley put him there. Waternoose asks Sulley to demonstrate a scare for Phlegm Bile, and this is where the problem of ""nice monsters should not act scary to human kids"" comes into play. Boo cries when she sees what terrifying faces Sulley could make. Mike warns Waternoose about Randall's evil plan, but Waternoose turns out to be an evil banana who was in on it the whole time, and he banishes Sulley and Mike to the human world through a special scary one-way door. Taking care of Boo is the most important thing to Sulley, something that made Mike angry because he was also worried that their friendship and Celia don't matter anymore. Mike also cared about Boo, but he needed time to think, and he still likes Sulley. My most favorite part of Monsters Inc was this really cool door chase where Mike, Sulley and Boo go through various different doors in the door vault. Boo stands up to Randall, and Mike and Sulley banish him to a trailer park. It was also funny when Sulley used Boo's door to trick Waternoose into shouting his plan for kidnapping 1,000 children in the training room, where Mike and the CDA caught it on tape and arrested him. Monsters Inc gets shut down because of this, but six months later, Mike and Sulley re-open Monsters Inc and change it from the scare floor to the laugh floor. It was a perfectly heartfelt moment when Mike repaired Boo's shredded door, and Sulley and Boo got to see each other again.One interesting thing I noticed about the Monsters movies is, that while they both have their own primary antagonist (Johnny for University, Waternoose for Incorporated), and Randall is their accomplice, Randall is really the overarching true villain between both of these movies. He was a monster (the evil kind of monster) who was an attention/popularity seeker and was always out for petty revenge against Sulley for being a better scarer than him, and Mike for not partying with him. I also noticed that Sulley was billed first in Monsters Inc and Mike was billed first in Monsters U. They are technically the duo that gets the most focus in both of these movies, but Monsters Inc focused more on Sulley when he tries to keep Boo out of trouble and runs away from Randall and Henry, and Monsters U focused more on Mike when he tries to be a great scarer and becomes friends with James Sullivan. Monsters at Work will continue that tradition by introducing a new lead, Tylor Tuskimon! I hope that Mike's and Sulley's roles will not get dwarfed by Tylor in Monsters at Work. I am so looking forward to that series almost 20 years after the original Monsters Inc movie, and I hope that some episodes focus primarily on Mike and Sulley and keep the original spirit of Monsters Incorporated and University. John Goodman was a main character in the animated series of Pigs Next Door and Father of the Pride, and reprised another movie role in a regular series, The Emperor's New School, so I have good faith that he and Billy Crystal will do the same thing in Monsters at Work, since they are not as famous or expensive as Tom Hanks and Tim Allen from Toy Story. There would be no Mike Wazowski and James Sullivan without Billy Crystal and John Goodman, and there would also be no Monsters at Work without Mike Wazowski and James Sullivan.","Monsters, Inc."

160,Darkjak007,We scare because we care,7,3 November 2021,"Monsters Inc. Takes use to a world of monsters we we meet Mike (Billy Crystal) & James P Sullivan(John Goodman). The top scare team at monsters Inc a company whose job is to go into the human world, scare children so they can use screams to power their world. The two of them are at the top of their game and close to breaking the all time scare record. It's all going well until one night Sully comes across a door left, and by accident he ends up letting a human girl named Boo into the monster world. Now mike & Sully have to find away to get boo home, but also uncover a much more sinister plot. Monsters Inc was always one of favorite when I little though keep in mind this was earlier in Pixar's career so they didn't really have much back then. Rewatching it I ended up still enjoying it and getting some and getting some of the things that I didn't necessarily get when I was younger Like the odorant or Harryhausen. The Plot overall is pretty original I like the concept of how this world works and how everything is powered, the concept of scaring I can't be the only who was curious how the door worked. Evening look back on it now the visuals don't really look very dated at all the monster still look good especially Sully the fur effects on him still move very great for 2001. The characters Mike and Sully both are likeable characters really enjoyed their Banter between each other. Even though some the jokes with mike don't always hit still both funny characters. Of course the biggest grasp with the movie is the relationship between sully and Boo. It's very heartwarming how they go from being scared of this little girl and turned around to protect her. Boo's cute and gets some smiles, but do it expect much. And Steve Buscemi as Randall is great just because he's Steve Bucemi. The C. D. A you wouldn't believe how many kids were going around shouting 2319. Overall it's enjoyable movie but it's little basic by today's standards with the amount of films now. Though that's what makes it good that it's not really over complex and it's always good for a watch just to sit down and relax without having to take to serious.","Monsters, Inc."

Secondly, the animation is up to Pixar's usual standards, even for 2001, with quirky and colourful character designs for the monsters, fluid movement and imaginative backgrounds. Thirdly the script was engaging with some funny, mildly scary and moving moments; the film's pace is even and the story had some fun, thrilling moments such as the door vault scene (reminds me of the luggage vault scene in Toy Story 2) and Sulley and Mike coming across the Abominable Snowman when they get banished for sneaking Boo to work, although some scenes are not as memorable as the ones that entertained me the most. While the soundtrack sounded somewhat generic, it had some fantastical elements and I liked the opening jazz music as well as the end credits song 'If I Didn't Have You.' Further to the end credits, I liked the company play footage. Sulley and Mike are diligent partners, Boo is sweet and playful, Mr Waternoose is firm, Randall is a scheming villain and Roz is strict but is funny during the outtakes (which are also a great laugh). The voice acting was superb, especially from John Goodman as Sulley, Billy Crystal as Mike, Mary Gibbs as Boo, Bob Peterson as Roz and John Ratzenberger as The Abominable Snowman. Overall, Monsters, Inc. is an amusing and thrilling offering from Pixar that is a sheer delight to watch despite the somewhat genetic soundtrack and a few forgettable moments. 9/10.","Monsters, Inc."
163,illbebackreviews,"In My Opinion, The Best Animation Film EVER!",10,13 December 2012,"'Monsters Inc' is one of the greatest Animation films of all time- There's no arguing that and it has become one of the classical children films. Prior to its 3D release, I will review 'Monsters Inc'Monsters Inc is about two monsters named Mike and Sully who are part of a factory by the monsters called...Monsters Inc. At this place, monsters are sent through doors and their objective is to scare children for more power. One day, a little baby girl accidentally finds herself in the world of the monsters and so Mike and Sully must secretly get it back to its home without any one of the other 500 or so monsters finding the baby. During this adventure, another monster named Randall is after the baby and will kill Mike and Sully.Here's something extremely funny about the film. The monsters are terrifying and appear to be ruthless foes but are extremely afraid of humans, in particular babies! The film has many laughable elements and constantly makes me laugh. This is one of the few classical films that I'll be able to enjoy forever! The characters are a major strength in this film, in particular the relationship between Boo and Sully as well as Sully and Mike. The film takes many clever twists and keeps its audience engaged in the film. The animations look terrific for its time and 11 years has passed since the day it was released and still...The animations look spot on PERFECT! The story is superb in this film and very easy to follow. Unlike many other failed Animation films, Monsters Inc keeps developing the plot and characters up til the last minute.

Pixar of course wouldn't make it fearful, but brought lightheartedness to it and made a highly imaginative tale of a fictional world where monsters scare children to power their city. This film is illustrated with creative monsters and styled with classy/jazzy music. The feeling while watching this is amazing and the emotions you feel for the monsters is just magical. Pixar has once again OUTDONE their-selves with every project they have thought of. Monster's Inc is definitely one of the top Pixar movies and also one of the most creative. If you can outlook the childish themes and look deeper into the movie's heart and soul, you will definitely be immersed in Pixar's movie-making magic. Most people would complain about the animation because animated movies have this thing when where one sees one, it's automatically horrible and childish. If one is made by Pixar, I highly recommend you sit down and see what they can do to animations; you will be amazed. 10/10.","Monsters, Inc."
167,fjhuerta-2,Polygon characters with more emotion than human actors.,9,16 December 2001,"How do the wizards at Pixar do it? How can they?That's the only thing I could think about when I watched ""Monsters, Inc."" yesterday. And realized that, no, nothing I had seen there existed. It's a lot easier when watching traditional animation not to get too immersed in the scenes; after all, you are always aware ""this is not here"". But CGI is making tremendous advances every day.Furthermore, it's not only the realistic animation what impresses the most. It's the heart and soul Pixar embed in each and every of its films. Witness ""Shreck"", a very good film on its own right, for example. It was a major hit when it was running on theaters, yet it's seldom talked about nowadays. Now, think ""Toy Story 2"" or ""Toy Story"". Both were movie milestones, and definitely are destined to be classics in a couple of years (dare I say both are ""instant classics""?). The secret, or reason, is in the powerful dose of humanity Pixar gives each and every one of their creations. They all have so many human traits it's very hard not to end up liking (loving?) them as if they were real. In a sense they are, being perfectly well rounded characters in perfectly recognizable situations. The fears and hopes of human beings are indelibly etched in every character (fear of death, fear of loneliness, fear of failure, etc.), which makes them even dearer to our hearts.From the animated short that's shown at the beginning of the movie (the ""Birds"" featurette, a very similar concept to the ""Carnival of the Animals"" section of Fantasia 2000... very funny) to  story development, ""Monsters, Inc."" works like a charm all the way, all the time. Steve Buscemi, John Goodman and Billy Crystal are always having a ball, with a tremendous sense of chemistry between them. Couple that with the prettiest, best CGI character I've ever seen (Boo), and you have a group of superb people playing their parts perfectly well, in a story that is funny, very sweet, and that will leave you filled with love and laughter.
Still... I think this movie comes *this* close to being another Toy Story 2. It's not that it is a bad movie; it's just that TS2 is a landmark; not only the best CGI movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made, period. TS2 most enduring quality is that, to a certain degree, it can soften the most hardened soul with its sweet, beautiful message, while ""Monsters"" is a bit less complex in its underlying theme. The fact that it managed to retain so much humanity throughout it, though, is a testament that the wizards at Pixar still have that magic touch that eludes so many famous ""live actors"".I want more.","Monsters, Inc."
168,jackgdemoss,The animation even holds up at times.,9,29 December 2019,"I was recently gifted a ""100 movie advent calendar"" for Christmas. When you are ready to watch a movie you scratch one of the boxes off and it tells you what to watch. The first draw was Monsters, Inc. I haven't seen this classic for over 10 years, but my wife was pulling quotes out verbatim. The opening 10 minutes are executed to perfection. The characters are introduced nicely, the plot and obstacle to overcome laid out, the world built, and the comedic timing perfect. The compilation of Mike training Sully with scare exercises had me rolling. The movie does lose steam after this first 10 minutes but it certainly never sputters out. Monsters, Inc. is a classic for a reason, and is a must see.","Monsters, Inc."
169,Aidan McGuinness,Pixar (mostly) do it again,8,11 February 2002,"There's very few movies that I'd see based solely on a name attached to it. One of these would be a film by David Fincher and another would be a film by Pixar. Pixar produced ""Toy Story"" and, funnily enough, ""Toy Story 2"". Anyone who has seen those classics will realize that that is more than enough to make you go and see ""Monsters, Inc.""How does the movie live up to the legacy of Pixar? Mostly pretty damn well. Firstly it looks wonderful - animation in movies is constantly improving and here we can see how Pixar have been able to enhance details such as the fine movement of hairs on Sully's body. At the same time the movie is able to feel like an animation - it has no pretensions about trying to be real as the characters are animated with extra-large-wide eyes, disproportionate heads, etc. The characters in here are not as good as in the ""Toy Story"" series. That's the film's biggest flaw. They're not as cleverly drawn or as diverse. Certainly we have no cynical Woody with whom the adults of the audience can relate to. Sully is the gentle-lovable-lug and Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is the wise-cracking-side-kick. It's an old and popular formula because it works. The villain of the piece is Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) and he's about as one-dimensional as they come which is no more than you'd expect for a movie aimed for the child's market. Boo - the child of the movie - is adorably cute without every being irritatingly so. You can't help but love her and she's the nicest piece of the cast. However in the end I found the cast somewhat unmemorable and the voice-over talent weren't used to their full capabilities (Buscemi could certainly let rip as a cold, calculating villain had be been able to). However a comedy lives and dies by it's script and here ""Monsters, Inc."" is very good. Some comments here suggest that the humour is aimed for children and is thus a hit-and-miss affair with adults but that's a load of cobblers - I was in a packed theatre and every single person was laughing. The humour really kicks into key when Boo - the child who accidentally stumbles into the world of ""Monsters, Inc."" - arrives on the scene and causes havoc by merely wandering around. The concept of the movie - that their world is powered by the screams generated by the monsters that come out of the cupboard to scare children - is wonderful but the final plot resolution is painfully obvious (I know, it's a kids movie but even so...). The script is very well paced and there's plenty of diverting action. Admittedly the humour isn't as clever as ""Shrek"" - there's none of the sly referencing or winks to the older audience - but it's still pretty quick and the out-takes over the closing credits are fantastic.""Shrek"" is the only recently comparable piece to ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Shrek"" slightly wins out by virtue of acknowledging it's older audience and having slightly better characterization. That aside ""Monsters, Inc."" is the best comedy I've seen released this year by a long shot and is well well *well* worth seeing. A very firm 8.3/10.","Monsters, Inc."
170,Brogan,Where the Wild Things Are.,10,10 November 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** MONSTERS INC. reminded me of the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak, ""Where the Wild Things Are.""  Both stories are about the imagination of monsters living in children's closets, but these monsters aren't dangerous, they are harmful and friendly.  Where in ""Wild Things Are"" the monsters enjoy the company and playtime with the main child character, Max. MONSTERS INC.  the monsters are actually terrified by the presence of a child or anything that is human for that matter.  In fact, the monsters are more afraid of the children than the children are of them, nice irony. MONSTERS INC. is about two power plant factory workers in the city of Monsteroplois, James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).  Sulley is the number one monster frightner for the factory, as Mike is Sulley's loyal assistant, roommate, and friend. The monsters have assign doors placed in front of them which leads them to the closets of real world into children's bedrooms so they can scare the children. The monsters of the city need the screams a child gives when they see a monster, that is how they get their energy.  The film even does a witty sub-plot to the real-life California rolling blackout energy crisis.  Sulley is admired by his co-workers and his boss Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), while Mike has a flirting romance with the company secretary, Celia (Jennifer Tilly). Everybody likes the winning duo except for the jealous Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) a chameleon-like monster who adapts his skin to his surroundings so he can hide. Randall has been putting in unofficial ""scare hours"" so he can be the top monster at Monsters Inc. It's when Sulley accidently opens up one of Randall's closet doors to find a small girl, who Sulley calls ""Boo"" has enter into the monster world.  There is a eariler scene that is horrifying realistic in today's time when a child's sock is stuck to a monster and the decontamination a monster goes through for his and everyone else's protection.  With Boo in the monster world, things can be catastrophic. Sulley and Mike try to hide Boo (even dressing her up like a monster) as they look through the billions of closet doors, to find the right one to her bedroom, as Randall wants Boo for a diabolical scheme that he plans to use her for.  But it when Sulley and Mike try to help Boo find her way home, that they begin to both feel like parents and want to help and protect the infant child. After getting a sour taste of this year's computer animated films (yes I'm talking about SHREK), MONSTERS INC. proves that Pixar and Disney animation is a winning combination and shouldn't be competed with.  Where SHREK was full of potty jokes and mugging the camera, MONSTERS actually tells a story that has a lot of depth and meaning behind it.  SHREK wanted to do cut-down jokes (especially to Disney films), MONSTERS INC. instead takes a different path and does jokes about life in general and the monster's lives are similar to our own. I found MONSTERS INC. to be another winner from Pixar, who are so far 4 to 1 on my scoreboard for successful computer animated films (only Dreamworks SHREK being the only point for the other team).  If people are asking themselves, ""gee there's SHREK, FINAL FANTASY, and JIMMY NEUTRON, how can MONSTERS INC. be any better?""  Well that's simple, it's like saying how is a ride at Disneyland better than a ride at a carnival.  Where a lot of film studios and companies are adapting to computer animated films, Disney always manages to stay a few steps ahead of it's competitor's.  First, look at the millions of hairs that cover the wooly Sulley, the scenes when he runs you can see the hairs gently move from the breeze.  Second, the human child of Boo looks more realistic than any of the generic humans in SHREK. Third, there is much more color with the Pixar films, I figured this out when ANTZ and A BUG'S LIFE were released three years ago.  Finally, the messages and morals behind the Pixar/Disney films are more original, where MONSTERS tells the viewer that don't judge a book by it's cover, that the most terrifying looking things can be the most caring.  And that it's difficult to be a parent but with teamwork and care, it can work!  Where SHREK is doing the things aren't what they seem moral which Disney did 60 years ago with DUMBO, and DUMBO was much more cuter, charming, and more touching than a obnoxious loud orge. It doesn't surprise me that MONSTERS INC. was directed by former SIMPSONS producer David Silverman, and Pixar veteran Peter Docter.  Disney had some competition this year for computer animated films, while Dreamworks had a royal flush, Disney won by having the royal flush straight, and should win the Oscar for best Animated film this year.  Until the magic and wonder of Mr. Potter is released, this is one film that Potter fans (children and children at heart) will love and wanting more, just like I did!  ***** (out of five)","Monsters, Inc."

They have not yet disappointed and there films are always perfect. They missed a few things in Cars. But smashed away by worries away with Ratatouille. They haven't made one bad film. Just by the knowledge of Monsters Inc being made by Pixar should be enough for anyone to see this. Again another superb animated movie.The animation was great. Wonderful color and details. After a little while the characters stop being 3D images and start being lovable and actually have the ability to move you to tears.Even though there are monsters in this it is still suitable for kids. There are some scenes that could scare young kids. But they shouldn't scare kids too much.The story was great. It was very creative. Monsters Inc is the kids scream power plant in the monster world. In the monster world human children are toxic. When the plants top scaring team Sully and Mike accidentally let one kid called Boo into their world. All hell breaks loose. Returning the kid to her bedroom is not as easy as it sounds.I couldn't have asked for a better ending. There's action,laughter and tears.This movie just keeps getting better and better. From a colorful and creative opening to a funny end credits scene, Monsters Inc is one to put on your must watch list. I recommend it.10/10","Monsters, Inc."

But when you get deeper it about you can care for people who are that most discrimination against when it comes to look and stuff. I loved it. The messge was great. I think everyone should have to watch this story. I loved all the door designs that were in this movie. At loved that at first sully is scared of this little girl becuse people have told her to be scared of her but when he finally spend a good amount of time. He starts to learn along with mike that she not as bad as the monster make out her kind to be. It might be a likely friendship for a little girl and two monsters to have but it was a good one.

Monsters Incorperated, was the next great film to come from the script of Peter Doctor and the studio of Pixar. Though Toy Story mas have been hard to even come close to, Monsters Inc may be even better than Toy Story, which most other Pixar films can't top.

176,f-88612,MIKE WASOUKI,10,25 January 2021,"Monsters, Inc. is a 2001 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter in his directorial debut, and executive produced by John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton. The film centers on two monsters - James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski - employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc, which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when one sneaks into the factory, Sulley and Mike must return her home before it's too late.Docter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon and Ralph Eggleston. Stanton wrote the screenplay with screenwriter Dan Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film's five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to simulate fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar's three prior films, returned to compose for its fourth.","Monsters, Inc."
177,sandnair87,The 'Monsters' at Pixar Scare Up a Laugh!,9,14 December 2015,"In the extra-dimensional city of Monstropolis, the power grid runs on the screams of human children, caused and captured by the (otherwise perfectly friendly) monsters who creep through their closets every night. The motto at Monsters Inc. is simple and endearing –""We scare because we care"". Sulley (perfectly voiced by John Goodman) is a large monster who is able to scare children by walking into their bedroom late at night and exposing his vicious teeth and frightening scream. The perfect comic foil to Sulley, Mike (Billy Crystal, spot-on) is the guy who keeps his pal in tip top scaring shape - ordering up the closet doors that the monsters go through to frighten children, whose screams are bottled and converted to the energy that keeps the monsters' world, and Monsters, Inc., going.As the story in 'Monsters Inc.' continues, a tiny tot nicknamed Boo refuses to be scared and sneaks through the portal into the world of the monsters. Ironically, the burbling, giggling, ""Kitty"" shrieking tyke scares the dickens out of monsters, as much as our amiable monsters scare little kids. It is now left up to expert ""scarer"" Sully and his one-eyed pal Mike to put Boo back where she belongs and restore order to the universe before the Child Detection Agency can get wind of their mistake.Like every Pixar film, 'Monsters Inc.' is crammed with intricate and subtle details, but the tortuous storyline is laid out so flawlessly that even broods have no problem keeping up. The admirable oddness of its plot — affable creatures harvest children's screams via an inter-dimensional network of cupboards — may now be softened by familiarity, yet it remains as fresh as ever. Laughs are earned throughout this heart-warming story that never engages in the potty humor that so often undercuts these films - the interplay between Sully and Mike results in jokes which feel wholly unexpected and off-the-cuff. But it's in the visuals that 'Monsters Inc.' really comes to life, from the decor each child has on his closet door to the vast variations of monsters on the job on the ""scare floor"" – blobs, giant spiders, lizards, snakes and goblins right up to the dizzying finale, set in a seemingly infinite warehouse of doors, each of which opens on a different bedroom in a different part of the world.Successfully combining intimacy with a sprawling alt-universe world, marrying a gentle character comedy to a slam-bang chase finish - this is exactly what Pixar is so celebrated for. While successfully marrying all of this to jaw-dropping technology, the monsters at Pixar scare up a laugh!","Monsters, Inc."
178,ab-2,Funnier than Shrek but not a better movie,10,16 November 2001,"Monsters Inc. was no doubt a funny movie, with great animation. The movie focuses on two monsters: Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal). They work for Monsters Inc., a company that is the source of a monster city. It controls everything from lights to water. They get all this energy from children's screams. When one child accidently enters the monster city, Mike and Sullivan try to get this child back to her world. But Randall (Steve Buscemi), an evil monster wants to use the child for his experiment to become the top monster for Monsters Inc. This movie is funny for all ages from 1-1000+. The reason why I think Shrek is a better movie is because Shrek seemed more realistic in animation and to be honest, acting. I still recommend this movie to all people.10/10","Monsters, Inc."
179,Benjamin_Cox,"A Pixar masterclass, one of their best - 90%",9,30 March 2005,"Many, including myself, will be lamenting the fact that Disney and Pixar are no more - or at least, no longer working together. In the last ten years since ""Toy Story"", they have consistently produced high quality animation that pulls off the one trick Disney rarely could. Pixar films entertain parents and kids alike and it doesn't matter which film you take them to see because all of them stick to the magic formula of being as much fun to everyone as they can. Having re-watched ""The Incredibles"" last night, I still say that film is one of my new favourites and it was with eager anticipation that I watched ""Monsters, Inc."" today. I wasn't disappointed but then again, I wasn't expecting to be.""Monsters, Inc."" takes a premise that should be as child-unfriendly as you can imagine and reworks it. Monsters, you see, emerge into our world through the door to your closet (or whatever, seeing as we don't have closets in the UK) in order to provoke screams. They need screams because they use them as energy, powering their homes and businesses in Monstropolis. However, monsters are generally afraid of children as well, believing them to be toxic and deadly to the touch. So when a cute little girl called Boo (Mary Gibbs) makes her way through into Monstropolis, all sorts of panic and chaos arises. It soon becomes apparent that Boo is being looked after by top-scarer Sully (John Goodman) and his one-eyed companion Mike (Billy Crystal), who must return Boo to her bedroom before evil monster Randall (Steve Buscemi) finds her.Words generally fail to do justice to how well ""Monsters, Inc."" looks. If you thought ""The Incredibles"" was as good as it got, think again. Sully is a joy to behold, a large blue yeti-type creature with each of his 2.32 million hairs all flowing and looking unbelievably real. Boo too is brilliant, capturing the movement and garbled speech of a child to perfection. If you don't fall in love with her and her innate ability to wander off and cause trouble then I'd go to the doctor because something is clearly wrong. Goodman and Crystal are probably one of the funniest and unlikeliest double acts to emerge in recent years, squabbling with each other and bursting through their monstrous visages (no offence, guys!) with enthusiastic relish. The ideas that run throughout this film are just glorious, from the frankly genius explanation of Monstropolis to the little bits and pieces that litter the cinematic landscape. A restaurant called Harry Hausen's - fantastic! Though it isn't as much fun as Pixar's latest, you'd have to a heart of stone not to enjoy ""Monsters, Inc."" For whatever reason, this film doesn't seem to get as much praise as it should because this really is a fine piece of work, one of Pixar's very best and the best thing Disney have released since ""Aladdin"" (excluding ""The Incredibles""). There are moments when the humour falls a little flat, such as the incompetent co-workers who sound denser than a bag of bricks. But the humour is fresh, the ideas are astonishingly original and the vocal talents of all involved (can some mad scientist keep little Ms Gibbs at the age of six forever and give her a microphone?) are perfectly suited to their roles, as if anything less than perfect would do for Pixar. To miss out on this film would be nothing short of disastrous. Get a copy and play to your kids, because you'll all love it. And if you don't have kids (like me) then watch it by yourself and still enjoy. It will be out little secret...","Monsters, Inc."
180,Ozzy2000,Excellent children's film really cute,10,5 July 2008,"This wonderful Walt Disney animation is a story about the strange world of monsters that usually invade the dreams of children and their world is energised by their screams of fear.

This monster Sully and his mate Boo decide they love children and that there world needs to find an alternative energy source.A very beautiful and enchanting film for the young and young at heart. My mom, who was a close friend of Late Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck, loved the film and thought it was very suitable for her grand children and so I do I.

187,C22Man,Excellent in nearly every way,7,22 January 2016,"The premise behind Monsters, Inc. isn't something that we haven't seen before, but it is one that allows for a lot of creativity and one that the film takes full advantage of. Pixar was still in a relatively early stage when the film came out, yet it was the perfect way to show that their imagination knew no bounds. It centres on two monsters at a company whose job it is to scare children because the monster world is powered by the screams of children. Now that is a really inventive idea. But their world is thrown into disarray when a child called Boo gets out (with monsters believing children are toxic) and our two heroes have to get her back, all while not being found out and uncovering a wider conspiracy. This leads to a story packed full of twists and turns, plenty of comedy and action set pieces, and a surprising emotional heft.The story itself allows for a vast amount of creativity with the concept of monsters having this kind of job, all the unique designs and the fact that they are terrified of children. It is also great how detailed the story is, because you simply never know where it's going or how it's going to end up and its constantly gripping as a result of that. The two leads are vital to the story and thankfully they are both great. Sulley is the company's top scarer, yet on the inside he's just a big teddy bear and there is something so endearing about him. He's a really warm screen presence and seeing his relationship with Boo grow throughout the film is strangely beautiful. Mike is much more of a wise-cracker and somewhat neurotic, which actually makes him a great contrast to Sulley. He does provide a lot of laughs and the friendship with Sulley feels very genuine. In fact both John Goodman and Billy Crystal deserve praise for giving such excellent performances.It's also impressive how well Boo is handled. Usually very young children can be annoying or plain boring, but she is the right balance of curious and gentle whilst still having enough funny moments. The fact that she speaks in a muddled sort of baby talk is another positive and actually makes her more endearing. Most notable is her relationship with Sulley, as it is build up just perfectly and their final moments together are incredibly touching. That emotional core between is a real strong point of the film. The films comedic moments are very well done too. Mike relies much more on his witticisms and anxious behaviour to get laughs which works surprisingly well, while the other monsters ineptitude when it comes to scaring also provides a great number of amusing moments.With that said one of the films few weaknesses are its villains. They're not bad, just a little one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Randall is a typically snide and aggressive rival, we don't learn anything about him and he doesn't really do much but try to hunt down Boo. He either needed to be funnier or more threatening to leave an impression. Waternoose also turns out to be involved in the plot despite his initial loyalty to Sulley, his conflict does make sense yet he is also a little underused. Despite that he does have a good design and James Coburn does a good job vocal. That said their actions do lead to a spectacular climax. It basically has Sulley and Mike frantically searching for Boo's door in what is effectively a gigantic room of doors. It's fun, it's exciting, it's tense, it is exactly the type of big climax you'd want the film to have. The animation is excellent once again. The fact that its set in a world of monsters allows for some really interesting and colourful designs, the majority of monsters look unique and are memorable as a result of that. Just looking at Sulley, the amount of detail put in with all his hairs is so impressive. We don't see too much of the monster world, but the factory is an interesting setting and still permits plenty of creativity. The side characters are a bit hit-and- miss, although the Abominable Snowman (Pixar regular John Ratzenberger) gets some really good lines and the cranky receptionist Roz is enjoyable. Randy Newman's score has an effective light, jazzy feel to it and it is brilliant. Not only does it suit the tone of the film, but it also adds a nice energy to the more action packed scenes and provides some wonderfully emotive melodies.So on the whole Monsters, Inc. is another big success for Pixar. I think that it works so because it gets the key areas right. The premise is interesting, the two leads are a great pairing, the main conflict is gripping and there is a strong emotional centre to the film that makes it even stronger. It is easy to care about these characters and want to see them succeed. I do think the villains are a bit weak and maybe the conspiracy is a little unneeded, but neither does too much damage to the overall product and that is because its central focus is so good. Added to that the animation, score and comedy all work fantastically to the best effect. It's a film that is funny, moving and engaging in all the right ways.","Monsters, Inc."
188,Jakemcclake,A Great Movie for Adults and Children,10,24 October 2013,"I have watched this every time it has been on TV/cable. This cartoon movie is a comedy, a drama and an action adventure flick with touching scenes and a feel good story, all in one. On top of all this, this fantastic story opens up a parallel universe of the closet monsters and how they, who terrified us, really feel about us. Despite the fact that it is a cartoon, you would be hard pressed to find a more intelligence in a movie script. After watching it, you could want to view it again to appreciate this movie to the fullest.We follow monsters employed by an energy company to create energy by coming out of children's closets and terrifying them. The screams and terror of the victim children are converted into energy and help to power the town they live in, Monstropolis a town in the parallel universe of monsters.We focus on several monsters in the fairly large cast of monsters, James Sullivan (Sully voiced by John Goodman), Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and Randall Boggs (Steve Buscerni) and Henry Watanoose (James Coburn). We follow these characters and their in and out of the parallel universe of monsters/human world, and we focus on their encounter with Boo (Mary Gibbs) a cute little girl and scare victim of Randall Boogs.The movie eventually turns into an action/adventure flick as we uncover certain evil doings with a touch of ""My Bodyguard"" in the main climax scene. Like the ending of ""My Bodyguard"", you get a charged happy feeling from this. There is also some touching scenes and final changes to the world of the monsters that is hinted throughout the movie, that only a good writer could have developed. I have scene this movie numerous times, and never get tired of it, despite knowing the ending so well.","Monsters, Inc."
189,cofemug,cool beans,9,4 November 2001,"Hey, I know I'm the type who loves those evil rated 'R' movies that ask for NC-17s, but I love this movie too.  In fact, I love Pixar.  They haven't made a bad movie yet (although I didn't care as much for 'A Bug's Life'), and this movie is no exception.  This movie has a sophisticated sense of humor, and is just as satirical as it is endearing.  Sure, you know the plot of the movie and the final result around 10 minutes (I'm guessing, i didn't look at my watch at all during the movie), but who cares?  The movie is full of humor and great graphics.  Unlike 'Shrek,' which I noticed somebody liked better, this movie wears its heart on its sleeve.  'Shrek' tried to make itself out to be an attack on Disney (and it was good for the first 20 minutes), but then it turns into an overly-sappy movie worthy of Disney. This movie never pretends to be bitter and mean, but is a bit tongue-in-cheek.  *Possible Spoilers* This is a movie which makes monsters in the closet friendly.  They collect screams to power their city.  But, the kids don't scare as easily, and there is a power shortage.  By way of an evil plan, a closet gateway (read Door) is left around for Sully to find, and the kid terrorizes the monsters.  The evil plan is to kidnap the kids and steal their screams to power the city. Sully and his partner Mike try to put the girl back, and eventually succeed, but not before being exiled, returning, and such. *End spoilers*Well, this movie fully understands subtle humor, and the college crowd (that's all that was there pretty much when I saw it) loved the movie.  Even the gay joke is innocent, and subtle.  The monsters are cuddly and friendly, and everything in this movie seems to work for the best.  It gets a little sappy in a few spots, but it never pretended to be anything but happy, not to mention the kids probably love it.  So, check out this movie...especially if you loved 'Toy Story.' (my favorite)  9/10","Monsters, Inc."

194,e-67102-48412,Disney really knows how to use cartoons to conquer audiences of all ages.,9,27 March 2020,"< Monsters.Inc > A very imaginative classic cartoon film, the image of various monsters is very creative, the fluffy hair of the hairy monster is too real, and the character is particularly loyal and cute. If humans and monsters can live in peace, it is also a very beautiful world.Even if the monster is the main character, it still achieves the goal that beauty is greater than ugliness. Even the villain does not feel his sense of danger. And inside, in the compact 90 minutes, there is an endless stream of jokes, especially the one-eyed dragon's words are really too much. The overall setting of the film is very closely related to children without losing the sense of science fiction. It is also a very good idea to use the screams of scared children to generate electricity. At the end, laughing instead of crying made the film's style rise again. Of course, that ""arbitrary door"" war is also the most exciting part of the film.","Monsters, Inc."
195,cnycitylady,A truly original film that all will love,8,2 January 2013,"Monsters Inc isn't a new film, but with its re-release into theaters I got a second look at it. This movie came out when I was a ""Wee Lass"" and so I could not tell you why I liked it other than the fact that it was a Disney movie. But I went to see it in 3D (not really necessary, although not awful) and I finally found out why this movie is a movie to love. This movie is an original story, and just how often do we get any of those? The monsters in the film work at Monsters Incorporated, where they have to scare little human children for electric power.You see them frightening human children who equally terrify them. One of these kids accidentally gets into their world and all hell breaks lose. The characters are witty, emotional and very well put together. John Goodman voices Sully, the monster who finds Boo and decides that he will help her return to her world, and his hardy heavy voice fits the big blue monster with a heart made of love. Billy Crystal voices Mike Wazowski, the little green fireball who's chalk full of craziness, and Steve Buscemi voices Randall, the slimy purple lizard like monster who stirs up trouble for the heroes and their little girl.The story-line is fresh and charming and the characters each come into their own as this little girl turns their lives upside down and wins their trust, their protection and their love. The setting is vivid with imagination and the everyday lives of these monsters is very similar to our own. The monsters have to go to work, pay the bills and keep their girlfriends happy.The movie gets a 9/10 for its originality, its quirky charm and the truly endearing characters who show you that just because they are labeled ""monsters"" it doesn't mean that they are beasts.","Monsters, Inc."

197,DanB-4,"Fun and Entertaining, but Not a Classic",8,18 November 2001,"Pixar has released its first mediocre film with Monsters Inc. Don't get me wrong, I loved it. But it lacked the sense of wonder of Toy Story, the character strength of A Bug's Life and the zest of Toy Story 2. This movie has some great scenes and fills the screen with wonderful images, but it falls short of its predecessors.Maybe living up to the first three Pixar features is an impossible task.Monsters Inc. has a wonderfully original premise. Monstropolis, the land where monsters live, generates its power from the screams of children. Monsters Inc. is a power plant where the most talented ""scarers"" pop through closest doors though a portal into a child's bedroom anywhere on earth. They scare, the kids scream, the monsters leave and Monstropolis has their power. A problem arises - kids just don't scare that easy any more. Only the top scarers are getting results. (As the ads say ""We scare, because we care."")There are two masterworks of animation in this film. The first is Billy Crystals character, Mike, who is essentially an eyeball with legs and arms. But even with these limited features, Mike still has phenomenal body language and facial expressions. The second is Waternoose, the boss at Monsters Inc voiced by James Cockburn. Waternoose is this giant, multi-eyed thing in a business suit that creeps along on crab legs, but projects the image of ""the boss"" while still being creepy. Amazing.I found Randall, the villain, just not bad enough. To be a Disney villain, you have to live up to the standards set by the likes of Ursula, Uncle Scar, the Wicked Witch and Jafar and Randall just doesn't cut it.Still a strong recommendation for this film. There are some fabulous visuals, most notably the wild ride through the warehouse of doors, and it sports a very original premise and works it well. I will never think of the number 2319 the same ever again.***1/2 out of ****.","Monsters, Inc."
198,haydenluz,Monsters Inc.,9,2 July 2020,"Monsters Inc. is another Pixar classic, originated by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton & Joe Ranft, while shooting for Toy Story. Pete Docter took on the role of director, being his first gig as a director for a major production, while Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter & Darla K. Anderson produced.Monsters Inc. was a very well told story. The narrative didn't just focus on scaring; It had a few sub plots, of friendship and maturing, but Andrew Stanton, Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon, Ralph Eggleston & Daniel Gerson balanced every subplot so well, that it flowed just right with the story. The writers stood true to the G rating, and kept everything pretty sane, with a lot of well rounded comedic tone.John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton & Joe Ranft, designed these extremely detailed & creative looking characters, with their own personalities, sounds, and appearance. Mike is one of main protagonist, who plays the smart guy, while Michael ""Sulley"" Sullivan, who is our other protagonist, is like the Tom Brady of Monsters Incorporated. Mike & Sulley have this tremendous chemistry, you can only really dream to have with a friend/co-worker. For someone who didn't have much to say, that we can really understand, Boo tests Mike & Sulley's friendship to different levels! Her character is so cute and charming, carrying a lot of weight for someone who couldn't sit still during voice recordings. Steve Buscemi does a great job as the voice of Randall, but he isn't the smartest of the villain bunch. If you really watch what he does, he's pretty oblivious, and his outcome is pretty pathetic, but comedic gold on our end.Needless to say, the animations were beautiful, with great detail, and textures. The score and music by Randy Newman was fantastic. It was so much fun, that it won an Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song.Overall, Monsters Inc. belongs at the top of the pack, because of all the heart, and wit put into this film.","Monsters, Inc."
199,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Not as good as the other Pixar movies, but still great",9,3 February 2005,"Monster's Inc. is another part of the great Pixar movies. Pixar really is the leading company in CGI effects. If you look at it, Pixar introduced the first fully computer animated movie Toy Story to the world in 1995. Ever since then, Pixar has continued to make movies and other company's like Dreamworks have also gotten started. (possible Spoiler) Monster's Inc. follows the world in which monsters live in. Their everyday job is to go into kid's rooms at night and scare them, because their screams are useful for energy in the monster world. The two main characters are the green one eyed Mike(voiced by Billy Chrystal) and Sully(voiced by John Goodman) who are the best workers of Monsters Inc. and are competing against an evil monster named Randall(voiced by my all time favorite actor Steve Buscemi). Despite being the fearless and ferocious monsters that they are, they are never supposed to touch a child or any of its belongings, because they think children are toxic. Everything goes wrong when a child happens to come into their world and isn't afraid of the monsters, but the monsters are afraid of her. The rest is pure fun, Pixar style.Most kids should enjoy this, it is possible that kids around age three will be scared by it, but it will probably make them braver about their fear of monsters. This is a great movie, and I think anyone who wants to watch a fun movie should watch it.","Monsters, Inc."
200,lingmeister,Disney and Pixar hits a home run again,8,14 January 2003,"Another great movie from the Disney/Pixar team.  It has the unique story which is great for both children and adults.  All the little touches throughout the film depicting the Monstropolis world are inventive and fun. It did not go for parody overload like Shrek did, but instead went with understated quality.  These things were not flooding the screen, but were placed here and there so that it would reward one who catches them.For the story to be an offshoot of children's imagination and expand to a whole world based on that is very imaginative.  The rest of the film has it all, being clever, witty, heartfelt, edge of your seat action and suspense.Another inventiveness is the the musical during the ending credits, which is the off-shoot of what Wazowski and Sully made up during their cover-up, as opposed to Shrek's kareoke after the movie, which has nothing to do with the film.The other great part of Disney is that the personalities of each character takes on the being they are portraying.  Although this film cannot follow that format since almost all the characters were monsters and we could only assume how they act in real life (as opposed to a caterpillar or a fish.) But it also allows the animator to be limitless in their interpretation of the monsters physical attributes and the way they act, although in some parts, Billy Crystal has to be Billy Crystal.  On top of that, Boo character just stole our heart.In all, a great movie for every member of the family to enjoy.","Monsters, Inc."
201,datautisticgamer-74853,Scares for the turn of the century... or not?,8,5 September 2016,"In a review that I had deleted, I described Monsters, Inc. as somewhat disappointing for its lack of unsettling imagery, with only a handful of scenes that actually made me jittery. But know that I have seen this movie again, I only now realized what this was meant to be; a family film that places peeving imagery aside and leaves us with some well executed jokes and designed characters, especially James Sullivan (whose fur rendering is so strong even to this day). Sure, some of the humor is catered more towards the younger audiences, and some aspects of the monster world aren't explored well (such as how monsters of all designs share the same shape of toilets, vehicles, et cetera, excluding those already explored in its chronological predecessor) but they will focus on that more than the subplots such as Celia's relationship with Mike. The roles are (no pun intended) monstrously performed to what they were intended, and perhaps more, which can't be found in a lot of movies specifically targeted at kids today. Now that I realize what I skipped in my previous review, I feel as despondent as Boo when Sulley returns her to her bedroom. If not for the questionable world they live in, this is a film that I am complacent to say that families must watch it.","Monsters, Inc."
202,japamo,"Immensely entertaining, especially during the current chaos",9,12 November 2001,"After reading some of the comments regarding an alleged ""Shrek""/""Monsters, Inc. rivalry, I simply want to conclude that I enjoyed both heartily (bought the ""Shrek"" DVD yesterday, will definitely purchase the ""Monsters, Inc."" DVD) and that both are highly accomplished animated features.  On the ""Ebert and Roeper"" TV show, critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes.  I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film;  the poor fellow must be jaded by so-called sophisticated movies. I will not rehash the plot.  I will say that all elements that constitute a movie, from background to characterization, were dazzling, convincing, and comprehensive.  Monstropolis emerges as a fully fleshed out dimension uncannily mirroring our own - even up to the minute, with the simultaneously uproarious but sobering scene where a monster returns from the human dimension with a child's sock stuck to his back and he is manhandled (monster-handled) by decontamination crew members. Mike Waslowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. (""Sully"") Sullivan (Goodman) move easily through this world.  While the ""Odd Couple"" pairing is obviously not new (as admittedly, the plot - BUT WHO CARES?), Crystal and Goodman add spicy spin to their camaraderie.  Despite Crystal's comedic presence, Goodman anchors this movie with his hulking and massive but ultimately sensitive and caring character, well, at least a good part of the time.  Boo gives Sully a run for his money in the  presence department.Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of ""King Kong), ""Monsters, Inc."" stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work.  It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie.  Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the ""Scream Suction"" device by the nefarious, reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy).  Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears  The dialogue and presence of the supporting characters was natural, matter-of-fact, and all the more funny for it.In short, ""Monster, Inc.""'s plan came wonderfully together.  Unlike some commentators, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided. Pixar, you've done it again.  Keep doing it...please!  ""Monsters, Inc. One quibble:  Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension.  I wonder what her parents were thinking when she was missing. Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all). Out of 5 stars, I would rate ""Monsters, Inc."" 4 1/2 stars(a slight demerit to familiarity of plot, but again, WHO CARES?)  Rejuvenate heart, body, and soul.  See this movie!","Monsters, Inc."

This one is when Sulley thinks he is watching Boo going through the garbage crusher. The faces they had the character make. Priceless!!I do not care for Randy Newman's music.

207,smashattack,Surprisingly excellent.,9,5 October 2002,"Disney is really starting to get in gear.  I am amazed at some of the brilliant films they have produced within the last few years.Spoilers.Monsters, Inc. is a great tale that strives for action and adventure as well as heart-felt emotions and good morals.  James P. Sullivan is a scary monster at its best in the industrial power plant of Monsters, Inc. and intends to keep up his good reputation.  Mike Wazowski is the comical, witty little one-eyed... thing... who intends to keep Sulley up on top.  However, Randall, a creepy, lizard-like monster, is out to do more than just get on top.  His plans are much more dire, and I think this is one reason I liked Monsters, Inc. so much.First of all, the characters, although monsters, can easily be connected with.  We understand what Sulley is feeling when he gets attached to Boo. We understand why Mike is upset with Sulley when they're stranded with the Yeti.  The characters are so real that it's like I could reach out and feel them there.I was a bit skeptical at first.  I thought that Monsters, Inc. would take place in a strange world with different physics and absolutely incomprehensible functions.  However, the movie tries its hardest to be as human-like as possible and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all with it.  It kept me in the loop on how things work.The plot is very unique.  The toddler, whom Sulley names ""Boo"", somehow gets into the power plant and starts to wreak havoc on Monstropolis.  In reality she is not harmful, and the events that take place before she is finally returned are downright hilarious and intense.The actual story was indeed excellent.  The problem amounted to unnerving heights as soon as they had Boo in the apartment, and even after that it continued to grow more and more.  I found myself hoping they wouldn't be caught, telling the characters not to go there, and I was even compelled to bite my nails.  The final conflict involving Randall and many doors is humorous yet, once again, intense (I especially liked the part when Mike and Sulley dive down into a door only to find that they're no longer falling...).The music, composed by Randy Newman, starts out in the credits with a light jazz composition.  Usually I find jazz annoying, but this wasn't so bad. Once it got into the movie, though, he switched to a nice composition.  It wasn't a major factor in the movie, but it held up in the end when Sulley is searching for Boo.There were some things I didn't like about Monsters, Inc.  For one, the evil villain, Randall, did not have a decent enough end.  I felt his story was unfinished as he was thrown through a door and beat down like an alligator. But, like it showed in the end, he could easily leave that house and find another, enter a closet, and easily return to the monster world.Also, the end had two things wrong with it.  First, it was a happy ending. In real life, it's a half and half chance of things turning out to be good. But in Disney, it always seems to end nicely.  I think it would have been more emotional if, when Sulley said goodbye, it was for forever.  But I suppose that wouldn't appeal to some of the younger children.Second, it was a little stretched out.  I felt that the movie did not wrap things up quickly.  Instead, it added more stuff in the end that I felt was not necessary.Altogether, despite those little annoyances, Monsters, Inc. is a marvelous tale.  Its setting in a different world makes it so interesting, the characters add depth to the story, and the events are mellow and intense at the same time.  It's a great film.","Monsters, Inc."

It eventually found its way into my Top Ten and it has stayed there ever since, not moving much at all. No one but John Goodman and Billy Crystal could have done the voices of Sully and Mike, and James Coburn was excellent as Mr. Waternoose. **Possible spoiler ahead** One main character, known as ""Boo"" is the only human character in the movie. She is maybe 2 years old, I'm not really sure. But she is really cute. SHe can't talk very well, being so young, and the movie makers had a hard time with Mary Gibbs, who provided the voice of Boo.

From ""A Bug's Life"" to both ""Toy Story"" movies (and even their shorts, if you've had the chance to see them), their outings have been a lot of fun.  ""Monsters Inc."" was no different.The movie felt a bit ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" to me in that the ghoul's and monster's fright-making was simply just their ""job"" for them.  When not scaring and causing frights, they led ""regular"" everyday lives outside of the haunts.  Kind of a ""behind the scenes"" look at the monsters under the bed (or in the closet, in this case).  It's a fun concept, and John Goodman and Billy Crystal pulled off the characters of Sulley and Mike very well.While I still believe that the best CG animation I've seen this year was ""Final Fantasy"", the range of emotions for Mike, Sulley, Boo and the others display went much, much farther.  Boo was a cute character.  Funny, easily distracted, vulnerable... she represented the average child (about 2-3 I'm guessing) for her age.  And again, while ""Final Fantasy"" was just jaw-dropping in terms of animation, ""Monsters"" had its own wonderful set of effects, lighting tricks and surprises to be found.The humor in it was very funny.  Everything from physical gags to self-reference and in-jokes, the film has something to offer on every level (the Yeti being my personal favorite ""Don't worry, it's lemon!"")  It also had its fair share of action scenes that offered a fair share of ""wows"" and fast pacing.  Unfortunately, the soundtrack didn't really stick in my mind, as I can't remember, much less whistle any of it after the film being over. But that is a rather moot point in a movie that was supposed to be mainly slapstick with a message about how children see their fears, and laughing produces more results than scaring.  A nice little message for times like these.But the one moment that got me the most about the entire film took place in the last two minutes: Sweet natured and simple, but not sappy with a huge musical score swelling in the background to force the viewer's emotions. I honestly don't think they could have ended this film any more perfectly.An enjoyable film.  Too bad I didn't see any ""outtakes"" at the end like Pixar's other efforts.  Maybe there will be something for the DVD. A good watch for 2001.","Monsters, Inc."
213,shaid,Cute.,8,6 March 2002,"*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*The idea of the film is nothing short of brilliant. The monsters of our childhood do exist. Only they exist because they need to collect the screams of the children so Monsters' city will have enough electricity supply. And technically it is flawless. Pixar has come long way from its first computer animated film. It succeed each time to go a step further and this is no exception. However the technical achievement get lost in a story which is as thin as ice and also suffer from the fact that Disney had to put its usual inserted messages(this time: friends are forever and laugher is stronger than scream). Dream Works' Shrek has proven that an animated film can be wild and sarcastic. Monsters Inc. stays however on the safe side and as always with Disney very politically correct. And that is a shame because what could have been a wild film turn out to be only a cute one. Yes I enjoyed it and laughed from it but I wish it was less politically correct(The ending leave no question in your mind that we are heading for a sequel). Pixar should think of breaking away from Disney. It will only do them good and give them the opportunity to do what they really want.P.S. Do not miss what is shown before Monsters Inc. A short film named ""For the Birds"". Simply hilarious. It proves that with the right thing Pixar can do even better.","Monsters, Inc."

You can't even say it out loud how great this film is because well, it basically does everything right.Our main protagonists. Mike and Sulley are a perfect duo of monsters. They both share the most funniest, craziest and even the most unbelievable performances to ever have in a Pixar film like this. Randall and Waternoose are the memorable villains of the film, you'll not forget them easily and personally, I like that Yeti character.One of the notable things in the film are the themes that combines all 'em together. It changes between happiness, mystery and sadness in which the film perfectly works with.What else can I say, Is this just for fans? No. Is this for your family? No. Is this for all the people in the world? YES!. I'm currently 16 and I've seen multiple reactions from all around the internet in which multiple fans react to this film!Either stream it in Netflix or buy it from the stores all around you.

216,TheMysteriousReviewer,"This Movie Is Good, Because It Cares",10,13 June 2021,"Monsters Inc is one of my personal favorite Pixar movies growing up. This movie had a concept of how monsters scare children and what happens when they encounter a human. The execution takes to a whole new level. The story is very well written. The animation holds up a couple of decades later. The comedy is great. The characters are all memorable. And the heart really comes to the right place, especially with Sully's connection to a kid. I know it's something I'm gonna say constantly to a Pixar movie when they come out a masterpiece, but this is a movie you need to check out. I even recommend celebrating this as a 20th anniversary before Monsters At Work comes out. I have seen this movie over a hundred times in my life, and this is worth watching a lot more in the future.","Monsters, Inc."

It is by far one of the most iconic pixar films ever made and I absolutely still believe it holds up today as one of the best animated movies ever made. From the amazing voice acting to the amazing animation even for the time. This movie is just classic and nobody can hate it. I love the story and the clever designs and quirks behind it all. It's just amazing story telling and brilliant design work as always from Pixar. Mike is easily one of my favourite characters of all time and I love his so much. Billy Crystal is absolutely brilliant and his energy is what makes Mike such a great character. I would say this movie is amazing but everyone should know that by now, everyone who loves movies has seen this film and it will be forever a timeless classic!

The story doesn't take long to kick into gear and it's not long before you find yourself enjoying the ride.  The voice acting, along with the subtlety of the animation, is what really brings the characters to life.  Boo was the cutest kid I have ever seen on screen, and she's not even real!Like Pixar's other films, Monster Inc. also has enough to keep both the little kids and the adults entertained.  Though not quite as hilarious as Toy Story 2, it has jokes a-plenty and will keep just about everyone entertained right from the start.Make sure you see it.","Monsters, Inc."
220,whatdoes1know,did you think this movie was great? you probably missed the Shrek DVD release on the same day,8,4 December 2001,"I gave this movie an 8, because it had a cool chase scene, and the little girl was almost universal, like the Sims. Then I saw Shrek on DVD, and I wonder why people think Pixar and Disney would even compete against Dreamworks at the Oscars! Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Waking life, Shrek, Blood: the last vampire, Final Fantasy, is there even room for Monsters inc? The plot is cute, but to quote my designated driver: ""that's such a bootleg ending!"" Shrek was predictable and fun and funny. Monsters Inc was predictable. Period. Shrek also creatively used conventional cinematographic techniques, Monsters Inc just showed you what was happening. The richness of expressions was also limited by the lack of development. Shrek made you feel Cameron Diaz beneath the digital expressions of princess Fiona. Sully only gave you cliches expressions-growl, surprise, sadness, resolution, endearment. You see what I mean? Comparing the two is worse than having a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Hillary Clinton! We love Hillary, but she's no heavy weight.","Monsters, Inc."
221,thousandisland,Strangely unsatisfying.,5,28 February 2002,"Monsters Inc is unfunny and lacks cast support.  It has a few cute moments and one horrible scene involving a ""scream extractor"" which should have earned a PG rating.  Not sure why Billy Crystal is even in it, as there are no opportunities for humor.  Sulley is sympathetic, but there just isn't enough substance or plot detail in this film to make it captivating.  The ending is nice but this one just kinda left me with an empty, unsatisfied feeling.. Like wanting pizza but forcing yourself to go to the salad bar, maybe?  None of the charm and intricacy of Toy Story, and it seemed too long.  ""For the Birds"" is the prelude short, and way funnier than anything in ""Monsters Inc.""  I will probably rent it and catch the outtakes, but I have no particular desire to see this film again.  'A Bug's Life' had many of the same pitfalls, but it's a better movie than 'Monsters Inc.'  My score: 5 out of 10.","Monsters, Inc."
222,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""We have a Twenty-three nineteen!""",9,1 September 2014,"Even though the premise of Monsters Inc. has been done before (monsters scaring kids and coming back to an office environment), this adds it's own creativity to it. It creates it's own world, it's own characters, and it's own reason to scare kids.James P. Sullivan ""Sulley"" (John Goodman) and Mike Watzowski (Billy Crystal) are a monster duo that scare kids for the company that they work for, Monsters Inc. They need the screams of children because the screams power everything in their world. However, they're in tough competition with Randall (Steve Buscemi) for the most scares. The monsters one weakness though, is that they believe that kids are incredibly contagious and that one touch can kill you. When a little girl enters their world, chaos ensues and Sulley and Mike have to bring the girl back, only to discover a conspiracy within the company.I'll just say what bothers me the most of the film: the evil conspiracy. While not bad, I barely could follow it. But to be fair, that's not the focus of the movie. The focus of the movie is the interaction between Sulley and Mike and the little girl, which they later name Boo. I like the irony of two monsters being scared of something as harmless as Boo. The monsters, come in every conceivable shape, size and color, which must have been one of their attractions, and the movie is jolly to look at. And since the monsters are terrified of Boo, whose very name is a rebuke to their lifelong missions, there are screams and chases on both sides of the closet doors. Speaking of those doors--turns out they're manufactured in Monstropolis, to such exacting specifications that no one ever figures out they didn't come with the house. The most entertaining sequence in the movie is a roller-coaster chase scene involving hundreds of doors on an endless conveyor line that loops the loop at a breakneck speed.''Monsters, Inc.'' is cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and references aimed at grownups","Monsters, Inc."
223,kill-the-boxtrolls,Who else would hate Monsters Inc.??,10,28 March 2010,"Its one of the best animated films I've ever seen over these ten years and its far better than monster movies like Monsters vs. Aliens or anything else it was just adorable. I like animated films but this should've received a golden globe for best picture or something. Its about a monster with blue-fur named ""Sulley"" has a companion or something named ""Mike"" and they hear of a commercial called Monsters, Inc. where a factory, Monsters Incorporated is aimed for the monsters to fear children in their closets. They soon discover a small toddler named ""Mary"" or ""Boo"" and all she seemed to do is do ""baby-talk"" and the reason why she is doing that was because between the character and the real actress were both two and a half so she couldn't talk yet but she was potty-trained. And the reason why Sulley was so scared of Boo was because she was a different specious, other monsters were afraid of her, too and they think she could do anything she wants but to wreak havoc. The next day, Sulley and Mike get used to Boo and dresses her up as a tiny little toddler monster to keep a disguise. Although Mike has a somewhat girlfriend named who'd he call ""Scoompchie-Poo"" but broke up with him because he ignored her birthday party all because of the havoc-like child. Boo soon needed to go to the bathroom but seems to have a pretty secret fear of ""Randall"" the monster next to the ""top scarer"" Sulley. She soon escapes and Sulley and Mike set off for a wild, crazy misadventure to look for her. They soon found her in a serious of normal pre-schoolers and which Boo calls Sulley ""kitty"" as her favorite monster found the monsters. It's a little disappointing to see a kid be upset over a monster scaring her off so badly on the set but this is a spoiler and you know why?? Because Sulley is seriously the top scarer of Monsters, Inc. but she soon got used to Sulley and Randall and has no fear over them anymore. The movie's pretty intelligent, yet clever with two monsters finding a normal but average-intelligence little girl and help her on a clever misadventure to find the correct door.","Monsters, Inc."

The movie has a pleasing premise that monsters scare little children so the monsters can harness the children's screams as energy to run their monster world.  The story follows the monsters' top ""Scarer"" Sully and how he becomes a new man, er, monster when a very cute little girl named Boo comes into his life.The animation is incredible.

229,GHCool,Great film,10,17 November 2001,"I always loved going to the movies as a child.  When I was in fifth grade, I saw Toy Story for the first time.  I remember watching the movie and drinking in the computer-animated visuals and feeling the speed and urgency of the big chase scene at the end.  Toy Story was the movie that changed my life.When I saw Monsters Inc, I felt like I was in fifth grade again.  Pixar has gone so far since Toy Story.  Just look at Sully's fur as it moves because of the changing environment.  There are jokes for adults and children alike. And if you thought the chase scene between Sid's dog and the toys was amazing, you haven't seen nothing until you've seen the chase scene involving the roller coster of doors.  I would feel confident to say that that scene is one of the best chase scenes in motion picture history.","Monsters, Inc."
230,Thunderbuck,"Lovely, charming, FUNNY, and oddly moving.",10,17 September 2002,"Man, these Pixar guys are good.I had missed Monsters Inc. in its theatrical release, but my wife LOVED it and had been literally counting the days down to the DVD release.  We watched it together, and I know why.Monsters Inc. is an absolute charmer, and manages to steer clear of cloying sentiment.  I'll admit, much of my delight in this movie comes from being the father of a 2 year old who seems remarkably similar to ""Boo"", and I loved the convincing relationship between Sully and Boo.And they chose a wonderfully understated ending.  I loved it.","Monsters, Inc."
231,Thunderbuck,"Oddly enough, truly great...",10,1 December 2002,"I've posted a comment on Monsters Inc. before, but I wanted to follow up from the perspective of multiple viewings (my 2 year old daughter has taken to this movie like nothing else *grin*).*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*As much as I enjoyed Monsters Inc. on the first few viewings, imagine my amazement when I started seeing actual SUBTEXT in this cartoon.Okay, so the ""accidental fatherhood"" theme has appeared in many other movies (Three Men and a Baby comes to mind), but it works here, and is referred to in the script a couple of times.  Monster Sully really becomes a ""father-figure"" to the little girl who accidentally makes her way to Monstropolis, and passes through the same stages many real fathers do, from utter terror to affection to love.  The strongest element in Monsters Inc is that it's very easy to believe in the relationship between Sully and ""Boo"" (the name he eventually gives the child, to buddy Mike's dismay).   When Sully inadvertantly scares the girl in a demo for new trainees his dismay is convincing and heart-breaking.  The scene where Sully finally returns ""Boo"" to her own room is really an understated, emotional masterpiece, from the girl's initial glee at being home (and the way she shows off all her toys to her new friend Sully--a marvellous detail) to Sully's heavy-hearted exit. A nice detail about that exit--the animators may have been tempted to show a teardrop fall from Sully's eye, but instead we just see his eyes visibly moisten as he turns to go.  I loved it.The point that ""laughter is ten times more powerful than scream"" is actually a lovely touch, carrying the implication that a cooperative solution is always preferable to a confrontational one.  Even better, while this message is made distinctly, it isn't stated overbearingly.  It's a nice message for parents and labor negotiators alike.  It might be stretching, but I think there's even an environmental implication to this message that's not stated directly in the movie, but definitely seems to be alluded to.More unstated messages come from Mr. Waternoose (of course voiced masterfully by the late James Coburn).  In the commentary track on the DVD director Pete Docter notes that Coburn brought a warmth and a vulnerability to the character that none of the writers had seen, and that kind of added dimension makes him that much more powerful as a villain.  He also represents a dangerous resistance to change, and to adopt a cooperative solution in favor of one that's even more exploitive; Waternoose's idea of innovation is not just to continue victimizing children, but to escalate that victimization to an unspeakable new level.Okay, okay... I might just have too much time on my hands to start reading these messages into Monsters Inc, but I swear they're here.  And I don't think there's QUITE this much depth to, say, Shrek (which I continue to like a lot, BTW) or A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (which I also love, but for different reasons). ...And another note on the music: while Randy Newman's theme song ""If I Didn't Have You"" is pretty much a rehash of a lot of other songs he's done in the last decade or so, his score for Monsters Inc is marvellous.  His theme for the little girl is rendered in a few different ways, and the simple piano version that plays in the pivotal ""return"" scene is just plain wonderful.  And the swinging, big-band style score for the scenes in the Monsters Inc plant are very catchy.Yes, I think Monsters Inc. is a genuinely great movie.  But I feel a little funny admitting that :-)","Monsters, Inc."

No one has ever beaten him before with more scares. Mike (Billy Crystal) is an annoying and stupid monster who, to me, doesn't care about any monster but himself.  Together, Sulley and Mike make one of the best pairs in a cartoon movie that i have ever seen.
Monsters, Inc. is a movie people of all ages will enjoy because it has things for everybody and it has stupid and yet creative jokes. One of my favorite jokes in the film is when Sulley and Mike get to be on the cover of one of the Monster magazines and when they both see it, Mike's face is covered by a price tag and Mike freaks out because he can't believe he's on the cover of a magazine. That was a big laugh... but Monsters, Inc. was also sad at the end. I Cried when Sulley had to do what he had with Boo...

John Goodman and Billy Crystal form a great leading duo. Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life.

236,EdYerkeRobins,Pixar Fails Its Own Legacy,7,24 November 2001,"Disney and Pixar are at it again.  Inspired by their own sales figures of Toy Story action figures and lunchboxes, the two companies have collaborated once more for Monsters Inc., a film that would be flat-out charming if it wasn't so disappointing and lacking in the qualities that made Toy Story a good film AND marketing device.	The best thing about Toy Story was that the story didn't just focus on Woody and Buzz.  There were all those supporting characters, and every one, from Rex and Hamm to the aliens in the vending machine, had just as much personality and were just as funny as the main characters.  In Monsters Inc., with the exception of all-too-short scenes involving the Abominable Snowman and Mike's girlfriend Cecilia, there are no supporting monster characters at all; we're stuck with Mike and Sully the whole time.  No offense intended to Billy Crystal or John Goodman, as both are perfect matches for their characters, and put in a valiant effort, but neither of the leading monsters has any good lines (even Mike's ""Sure, blame the little guy with his ONE EYE!"" line from the trailer has been cut).  There really doesn't seem to be much humor at all, not even any toilet humor for the immature kiddies.	The other major problem with this film is that it reeks of unoriginality. The concept is brilliant, and the explanation of Monsters Inc.'s premise and why monsters scare is innovative and suggests what could have been; unfortunately, like many recent Disney films, the film is totally formulaic and predictable, all the way up to the obligatory ""heroes in peril chase scene"" that is thrilling, but will also no doubt inspire Disneyland's next attraction.  There wasn't even a trademark Pixar ""bloopers reel"" during the credits (although I will admit the film's opening credits were very classy, and reminiscent of the Pink Panther).	So what are Monsters Inc.'s saving graces? Well, it has the Pixar name, and a bad Pixar film is still better than the average bad family film (and really, since Pixar currently has no competition in the computer animated feature film market except Shrek, they can set their own standards for quality).  If nothing else, it's amazing to see the hypnotic realism of each individual strand of Sully's fur blowing in the wind.  There are also some slick inside references to Ray Harryhausen, California's recent power crisis and Toy Story, and a great bonus short included before the film that I actually enjoyed more than the feature film (just like in Bug's Life... am I noticing a trend here?).  On the whole, however, I guess I just expected too much from Pixar and took for granted the unique creative and critical success they had with the Toy Story films.","Monsters, Inc."
237,Laitue_Gonflable,Excellent Entertainment,9,25 November 2002,"Monsters, Inc. is another example of very cleverly-written and multi-levelled animation that appeals to young and old alike. The basic plot is instantly ingenious enough to appeal to even the most simple-minded of viewers, and it is a delightful satire on humankind's timeless fear of monsters. My favourite in terms of satirical tools is the two pimple-covered adolescent monsters who are so 'in awe' of Sullivan and the other 'scarers', which just puts that brilliant twist to the whole idea. The voices are excellent: Crystal, Goodman and Buscemi are all perfectly cast in their roles and they combine well with the very brilliant animation and clever scripting to produce a very likeable and entertaining film. This is not just one of those animated movies that attempt to lure adults through the use of well-beloved actors (Meg Ryan as Anastasia, one example). It really is enjoyable for the whole families. However, the basic warning that some scenes may frighten younger children I believe is well-justified and it is really the only criticism you could possibly have of this movie.","Monsters, Inc."

Definitely one of Pixar's best.Overall, 9/10.","Monsters, Inc."
239,Rhino Rover,"cute, amazing, very good",9,25 November 2001,"It's amazing how far CGI acting has come. I've accused some movies of having gone too far with the use of Computer Generated Images (CGI) and leaning on it a bit too much but in this case, the movie was all CGI and so it should be. Monsters, Inc. is basically a good old-fashioned cartoon, just tens times better than anything we used to watch as kids. And the interesting thing is that cartoons are no longer for children. More and more of these animated movies are appealing to the adults as much as they are to the children. Monsters, Inc. is about something that every child knows aboutmonsters in their closet. We've all had our own monsters that we were terrified of as a child and they always seem to come from that spooky closet in our room. How did these monsters get here? What are they doing here? Monsters, Inc. takes us into the world of bedroom monsters. Every closet in every child's room in the world is connected to the monster world. While the children don't really get anything out of having the daylights scared out of them, the monster's world is powered by the screams they generate out of children. Everyday, some monsters' jobs are to go and generate power by going around to the human children of the world and scaring thembut the one thing that is absolutely not permitted is for a child to enter the world of monstersWhy was this movie so good? Lots of things. They have fantastic actors as voices for the characters. John Goodman plays the main character of Sulley (big blue furry monster) with Billy Crystal playing Sulley's buddy and sidekick, Mike Wazowski (one-eyed gumball looking fellow). With actors like these two fellows, it's hard not to have good material to work with and I wouldn't be surprised if Billy Crystal adlibbed some of his lines.
What also added to the quality of this movie was the ability to capture the emotions and expressions of these characters. Unlike animation of the past, computers have been able to mimic human emotions and expressions with great accuracy. This has allowed for the audience to feel closer and relate to these fantasy actors and create an overall more enjoyable experience.Sometimes technology gets in the way of storytelling. It's happened in lots of movies where Hollywood thought that it could rest on the crutches of technology in place of a good storyline. Monsters, Inc. doesn't have this problem. On a basic level, the story is simple. The monster world is turned upside down when a little human child accidentally enters their world. But what the movie has been able to achieve beyond that is create a story that has good believable characters, even if they are fictional. The characters carry the emotions of what they face across the screen to the audience and the more the audience believes them, the better the story is. It's also nice to see that the humor is not just targeted at young children. I quite often heard adults laughing louder than the children and that's a good sign that the movie is appealing to everyone. I don't have any children but the friends that I went with all enjoyed this movie.Overall, this was a very good movie. The animation was amazing, the voice actors were excellent and the story was entertaining. Go see it.","Monsters, Inc."

Two monsters must protect a child in a monster World with a twist. You get fun, few scares, suspense and an eye opening ending that makes me give the DVD a 5 for no commentary. The ending is something as M.I. 3 do not seem to happen, but at least a TV show is next.","Monsters, Inc."
243,ayric,More Pixar Brilliancy Beats Shrek,8,21 December 2001,"2001 was supposed to be the year where Dreamworks for once would win the animation war against Disney with their great Shrek. Unfortunately for Spielberg & Co., Pixar would come to Disney's rescue again. Pixar seem absolutely infallible, and they fortify that feeling with Monsters, Inc. Monsters, Inc. is a funnier and warmer film than Shrek and, to me, that forms the most important part of a good animated film. It still doesn't quite reach the peak as Toy Story and A Bug's Life did, but the difference is slim.   The story is extremely original and well-written and is bound to keep both adults and kids pinned to their seats through the whole film. (Only one kid started crying, which must be considered acceptable casualties since the film is about monsters.) Even the ending is cut right before the last mandatory reconciliation, making it much stronger. If the story or the incredibly entertaining characters won't do it for you, the animation surely will. There are some details and scenes here never done before. This is, technically, the best achievement in CGI filmmaking so far. As a footnote, before the movie you will be fortunate enough to see Pixar's 3-minute short For the Birds, which is the funniest short film I have ever seen. Rating: 8/10","Monsters, Inc."

245,tripper0,amazingly cute....,9,12 November 2001,"I found it hard not to have a smile on my face while I was watching this movie.  It is so amazingly cute.  Pixar studios have made another amazing movie to add to their list.  Unlike the others however, this movie really doesn't work on two levels, just one, cute.  It appeals to the children and the children in the adult.  On top of that, it contains one of my favorite sequences in a movie that I've seen for some time.  For those of you who have seen it, its the door sequences in the different countries.  For those of you who haven't seen it, I am sure you will love that part as much as me, it was brilliant.  Fantastic movie, I recommend it to anyone.  9.5 out of 10.","Monsters, Inc."
246,treykrumel,greatest thing that happen to disney,10,21 August 2018,Look I've seened many Disney movies we all have at least most of us but this was a major success for its writing animation and heart warming pilot and dialogue this was a major in the early 2000's and will also be when you look at a Disney movies enough times you realize that it will never get old and you will still remember it probably.,"Monsters, Inc."
247,stegasaurob,Trash,1,1 August 2020,"This film is a complete mess from beginning to end. It seems to think it's cute and funny but it's neither. It's presumably supposed to be a children's movie, but so much of it is not really suitable for children, at least not young children.","Monsters, Inc."
248,Dilip,"Perhaps Pixar's best film; technically excellent animation, great color and music, and fun story!",9,25 November 2001,"""Monsters, Inc."" was a thoroughly entertaining, fun, and exciting film!  I loved Pixar's animation, of course, and the story was funny and interesting. There is a scene in the first two or three minutes of a monster's scaring a sleeping child (actually, a simulation at the Monster utility company), and a second scaring simulation 2/3 or so through the movie which some children as old as 6 or 7 may be disturbed by, but otherwise the film is great for all ages!The ingenious plot takes place at a utility company in Monstropolis, a world of monsters.  In 8-hour shifts, the citizen monsters go through bedroom doors of sleeping children; the screams that the monsters evoke are the energy currency of Monstropolis.  But even as they scare the children, the monsters themselves are afraid of humans.  What happens when a child accidentally enters an ajar door and comes into the world of the monsters?I found that I enjoyed this film even more than Pixar's earlier ""Toy Story"" or ""Toy Story 2"" (both also excellent films!).  ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of those few films that I left the theatre feeling that I would like to see the film again soon while it is still playing on the big screen.  I found the plot and animated characters (especially the main character monsters, Sulley and his sidekick Mike, and the so cute 4-year-old Boo - perhaps misnamed as she was, in fact, rather brave) to be captivating, the colors and music contributing to a fun ""retro modern"" style.  The humor could be appreciated by all ages, and I enjoyed catching a brief reference to ""Toy Story"", when Boo picks up a toy featured in that movie.  I loved the chase scene through the seemingly endless doors, and the scene with the Abominable Snowman, who was trying to be helpful (sno-cones, anybody?!).This film is certainly worth seeing again on the large screen and then owning when it is out on video.  The animation is rich; careful repeat watchings will no doubt reveal additional interesting detail, such as reading of all of the headlines in the scene where Boo is discovered in Monstropolis.Don't miss seeing ""Monsters, Inc."" while it's playing in theatres, so you can enjoy the rich colors and animation.  What a fun treat after the tragedy of September 11!  I rate is 9 or 10 out of 10!","Monsters, Inc."
249,DaRick89,Right up there with Pixar's best; Monsters. Inc is a monstrously good film which kids and adults can relate to,10,2 March 2006,"In my opinion, Monsters Inc. is right up there with the best of Pixar, behind the two Toy Story films, because Monsters Inc. isn't as groundbreaking. But that's where the criticism ends. Monsters Inc. is nearly flawless as an animated feature and I can guarantee that kids will love this film and have fond memories of it. Adults will relate to it as well. The difference between Monsters Inc and rubbish like Scooby Doo is that this doesn't rely on fart-n-urine gags in order to garner laughs. Its humour is always good-natured.As for the plot, it is neither ridiculous nor stupid, just a simple friend-finding exercise. Everyone will relate to Sully's pain when he loses Boo, the way anyone would when they lose a good friend. The moral of the story is easy to understand, even if it is a bit simplistic for my tastes. (Actually there are two, but the one that is implied the most)The animation is outstanding as usual and is therefore not worth mentioning in any great depth. What can be said about Pixar's animation that hasn't been said already? Nothing, so lets move on.The voice-overs are all great. No character in the film sounds 'lame', not even the minor characters. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi and Jennifer Tilly, among others, all make their characters sound believable, even vulnerable if they're meant to be. They give them more than one dimension and therefore avoid the stereotypes that come with one-dimensional characters.Well, what more can I say really? This is Pixar's third best film, behind the two Toy Story's and has no real flaws in plot, acting, animation or character development. Even by Pixar's undoubtedly high standards, Monsters Inc. is a movie to be proud of. Whether you are a kid or an adult, you should see this. If you haven't, see it as soon as you can. It'll grow on you, I can tell you that.5/5 stars","Monsters, Inc."

252,joseayarza,Nope,3,4 March 2002,"This movie is funny, no doubt about it, but it doesn´t deserve to be in the top 250. It´s pretty much... forgettable. Mediocre. Nothing compared to Shrek, Toy Story, or Toy Story 2. The plot is extremely silly. In general, I do recommend it, but I warn you, this movie ain't that good. 7/10","Monsters, Inc."
253,JRGBUCS,Great.,10,4 November 2001,"As the single 20-something, I'm not supposed to see movies like this. I should have seen ""The One"" or ""K-Pax"" or something like that. Of course this is the only movie with the ""Attack of the Clones"" trailer (which by the way was worth the $4.50 admission), so I made the 1/2 hour drive, just to be late and wait an hour for the next showing.So what do I think of it? It rules. Kids will like the monsters and Boo. The Adults will like the witty dialog and sight gags. And everyone will love what happens to Randal at the end. Much like The Simpsons, Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. takes the advantages of animation and creates a great story with great characters. Hopefully Pixar continues to create such wonderful movies.Also ""For the Birds"" is a great add on. I really enjoyed that.","Monsters, Inc."
254,GEM-20,"Good, but it is no ""Toy Story""",6,11 November 2001,"Seeing this film with my kids, I noticed something that was quite different than the experiences of the ""Toy Story"" films and ""A Bug's Life"": The kids were having a better time than I was. That was really too bad, because I wanted to have the fun too, but I could not find it.Maybe I am not as dazzled as I was with ""Story"". Computer animation is fantastic, but movies still come down to one thing: story. I just did not feel that the ""Monsters, Inc."" tale was as good as the previous efforts of Disney/Pixar.Before I go into a long talk of the failings of this film, let me first state that kids do enjoy it. From their standpoint, taking in an average of the 3 of my children, I would rate it ***1/2 out of ****. I know they will go to school, tell all their friends to see it, and there will be ""Monsters, Inc."" toys under the Christmas tree this year.So much for the kid review. From my viewpoint, this film tried to appeal utilizing many of the same methods of the ""Toy Story"" movies. Unfortunately, those films were better. ""TS"" gave us the idea of lives existing somewhere that we can't see. And, instead of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, replace them with Sulley and Mike. In ""TS2,"" Woody gets the girl and Buzz is the one driven to fulfill the mission. In ""Monsters,"" Mike gets the multi-legged girl and Sulley focuses on the job. There is even that moment between Sulley and Mike where they have an argument and go their separate ways. Seems very familiar.I guess I hoped for something funnier. This one has funny moments, but it seems to be going more for the ""Cute"" factor. The little girl, Boo, has a very cute face that can evoke many emotions. Sulley and Mike, voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal, are quite good too. Walking out of the theater, I had the disappointing feeling that I wished the movie could have had more. While the kids rate it ***1/2, my rating is either ** or **1/2.","Monsters, Inc."
255,nickthegun,The world is their lobster.,9,10 October 2002,"I loved this film. It is visually fantastic, well written and very, very funny. The characters are fabulous and well conceived and the story is excellent.
I cant really find fault with it, to be honest. Certainly a worthy followup to the Toy Story's, even surpassing them in some aspects.Its a short but sweet review of, you guessed it, a short but sweet film.","Monsters, Inc."
256,andynortonuk,funnier than the two Toy Story films!,10,6 October 2002,"This is really a hilarious animated comedy.

With a great cast including John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Frank Oz it is really got some talented voices to the delightful array of characters! There was nothing at all wrong with this computer animated classic! Not a single line! Nothing! It is just the perfect imaginative comedy! Excellent plot , extremely good score from the great Randy Newman, this is truly another great film from Pixar!","Monsters, Inc."
257,djansen24,They didn't forget a thing with this movie!,8,8 September 2011,"Well, Pixar did it once again. Simply a great film! As I watched this for the umpteenth time with my 2 boys, I was fascinated with how they tied up all of their loose ends while not forgetting to follow up on the most minute details. Monsters Inc. has all of the trademark elements of a first class Pixar film: good laughs, breathtaking animation, endearing characters (even the villains), and most importantly excellent stories. One has to enter this story with a certain suspension of belief (even by cartoon standards). The plot is absolutely ludicrous, but it takes itself seriously enough to envelope us into its world; in other words, the characters believe what they say. With that sense of incredulity placed to the side, feel free to enjoy the show, because it is a delight from start to finish. The little girl/s playing the voice of ""Boo"" is/are cute as ever (how do they get such good work out of children?). You care about all of the characters and you will probably even shed tears of joy at the end. The only quip I have (and it is a very minor one) is that the all-star Hollywood cast don't try at all to disguise their voices in their portrayals. They pretty much sound just like John Goodman, Steve Buschemi, Billy Crystal, etc. But the drawings and animation of their characters are so perfect that you quickly forget that Billy Crystal is talking and even really think he might just be a one-eyed, green skinned, little ball monster. One of the best elements to the great ambiance of the film the whole take on the ""monster in the closet/under the bed"" common childhood experience. It is an experience just about everyone of us can relate to, but then having it get flipped back on itself and making the monsters out to be just doing a job and being terrified of the kids was a stroke of genius! And wouldn't it be great if we could solve the energy crisis just by laughing more? I would like to live in a world like that... ;o)","Monsters, Inc."
258,jjgooner,An amazing creation,9,14 July 2013,"Monsters, Inc.***1/2 (out of 4)92 mins/ UCast: (voice) John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Mary Gibbs, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Rob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank OzDirectors: Pete Docter, David Silverman, Lee UnkrichPlot: In Monstropolis, Monsters generate energy by scaring human children in their beds at night, but when one escapes her bed and enters the city, two scarers called Mike and Sulley have to hide her to prevent the rest of the monsters from knowing. Why? Monsters believe children are contaminated. JJ's Verdict: Monsters, Inc. is one of the first films both children and adults can relate to. I can almost be certain that everyone in the world was once sure that there were monsters hiding in their rooms. It is funny, imaginative and full of lovable characters. The city of Monstropolis, unknown to the human world, creates all their energy from the screams of small children as designated scarers creep into their bedroom's every night. What humans don't know is that the monsters are as scared of the children as the children are of them. So when top scarer Sulley (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal) accidentally let a young girl loose and into the city, the pair have to try and return her to her 'door' while not letting anyone know how or who let her out.Monsters, Inc. is a magnificent creation from Pixar. The depth of imagination and creativity is a delight and director Pete Docter should be congratulated for one of the most original children's film of all time. Each tiny detail in the animation is so precise and the world of Monstropolis is just breathtaking, as are the small insignificant characters that pop up along the way. It could only be Pixar that can actually create a film that has both hilarious verbal and physical/slapstick humour and it seems everyone involved can such a brilliant time working on the film. It seems like Billy Crystal and John Goodman were actually there in the animation and their characters have such great chemistry. Steve Buscemi is perfectly cast as Sulley's scare rival Randall, a slimy and slithering chameleon, who is always up to no good. Also in the voice cast are Pixar regular John Ratzenberger who plays the actually very nice Abominable Snowman, 'The Great Escape' star James Coburn who plays Mike and Sulley's boss Mr. Waternoose and voice of Yoda and Miss Piggy, Frank Oz who plays Randall's weak assistant Fungus. When people think of Monsters, Inc. they think of Mike and Sulley as the best team-up but the loving relationship between Mike and Boo, the little girl who enters Monstropolis , is the films finest part in terms of emotion, care and utter cuteness. John Goodman really put his all into this film.Monsters, Inc., although very slow is enough to hold your attention and finishes on an excellent final chase scene which is genuinely threatening. Kids will adore it and adults will also love it with amusing pop culture references to Metropolis, Psycho, Tootsie, The Right Stuff, Toy Story, Fargo, Starship Troopers and Armageddon among others. And stay tune for an excellent credits scene.","Monsters, Inc."
259,Ajk2386,Possibly my favorite Pixar movie,10,15 November 2018,"This is a hilarious, fast paced fun movie about a little girl who gets into the monster world with Mike and Sully.

I also loved the character of Randall and the scene where they're flying around hanging onto doors is very entertaining.","Monsters, Inc."
260,nucksfan4life,A great movie full of humor and intelligence,8,23 September 2002,"With either John Goodman or Billy Crystal, you cannot go wrong. Put them together and you have a guaranteed success. That's exactly what ""Monsters, Inc."" is. These two actors know how do everything. I don't think they even need to be directed anymore. This shows in their dialogue throughout the movie; they never deliver a line incorrectly. Sometimes this movie is intelligent, sometimes it's very funny and other times it's both! The movie is stunning visually. The giant warehouse of doors is impressive. Sully's fur is a sign of how far computer animation has come since the days of ""Toy Story."" The story is very interesting as well and applies to everyone. Who didn't ever think that monsters were hiding in their closets? Pixar has an amazing way of capturing childhood imaginations like this and ""What if our toys were alive?"" that no other studio has ever been able to match.","Monsters, Inc."

This was so nostalgic to finally watch again after all these years, and I can confirm that this is one of the better Pixar films. I didn't actually realize that I liked it as much as I did until this rewatch. I also forgot how perfect the ending was, one of the best animated endings ever. It's also gotta be one of the most heartwarming stories ever, and the funniest Pixar film so far. As I'm getting older, I'm starting to see the deeper themes and adulthood issues these Pixar films are exploring, which is always interesting.

He sure did a good job of making people annoyed. The baby was annoying to but very funny. This movie is very entertaining. But could've been better. I just didn't like the idea where monsters were afraid of children but they scare children... That's the part i hate about. But kids will love this movie. some babies might cry... Because of the ""scary"" monsters. But this movie is family fun! Pixar is the best! but i think this movie is a tiny bit overrated. I don't think this movie should be in the top 250 list.

In fact, you can see Buzz Lightyear and Woody in the film if you look closely.  Also, which I find quite hilarious, you can see some forecasting of their next movie, Finding Nemo.  The little girl picks up a fish that looks exactly like Nemo.   Of all the Pixar movies, I would say that Nemo is the best, but Monsters is not far behind.   Both adults and children will love it.

My family (consisting of myself, my husband, our five-year-old son, and our two-year-old daughter) watched it twice in its first two weeks in the theaters.  My only problem is with whoever comes up with the marketing stuff for Disney movies.  If you look at the toys etc. that are available, you'd think the movie was ""made"" by Sully and Mike -- when, really, it's Boo who makes it worth going back to again and again. Boo gets only brief mentions in most reviews, and Boo toys are almost nowhere to be found.This is a great family movie; don't miss it!

It knocked me over, left me breathless, gave me what author/ critic/ scholar/ philosopher/ spiritualist CS Lewis calls a stab of Joy. It is that feeling of pure, unperverse warmth (not to confused with pleasure which can get guilty) that errupts something takes your fancy. Not that I can describe it half as good as that fellow. I think MONSTER'S INC is one of the best movies ever made. Best animated movie, though. Should have taken the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, but Shrek is good enough to get away with it. Unlike Shrek, which is silly yet deep(I own it on DVD, so don't complain), Monster's Inc builds more on character developement and scenario than pop-culture references (it has a few, though).This movie took me away into the World of Monstropolis. I was practically one of the characters (I have two eyes, in case you were wondering).I just can't understand how anyone could NOT like this movie. A work of art!","Monsters, Inc."
272,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 4 out of 5,8,29 December 2002,"Monsters, Inc. is another triumph of computer animation from the wizards at Pixar.  As with the Toy Story series, the plot is taken from a ""what if?"" scenario in a child's imagination.  What if the monsters (whom everybody knows dwell in childrens' closets and under their beds) in fact live in a parallel world to ours? 
Monstropolis City is powered by energy garnered from children's screams, which are collected by the workers at Monsters Incorporated.  James P. Sullivan and his sarcastic assistant Mike are Monster Inc.'s top scarers, but when Sulley inadvertently lets a small girl into the monster world things start to go awry.  Monsters believe that human children are highly toxic, and in their efforts to put little Boo back where she came from, they uncover a fellow worker's sinister plan to revolutionise the scream-collection industry.
One of the few down sides of the film is that at times it is just a little too cute, and Sulley definitely works best as a strong and straight-forward good-guy, as opposed to his attempts to be a moraliser and emotion-analyst. His computer-generated fur though is incredible.  Over one million hairs have been animated to move realistically in response to anything from a light breeze to a Himalayan snowstorm.
The concept of a factory that has an exact replica of every child's closet door, and that of monsters living in a world not all that dissimilar to ours is certainly clever; but it is also the little details - such as a ""Grossery Store"" and ""odorant"" (rather than deodorant) - which really make the movie. Although the ending is a trifle schmaltzy, this is a film that kids will love, and adults won't mind watching again and again.","Monsters, Inc."
273,taikman,Yet another witty and wonderfully animated movie from Pixar.,8,7 April 2002,"'Monsters Inc.' is one of the computer-animated successors to the brilliant 'Toy Story'. It lives up to the tradition of brilliant animated films both kids and adults can enjoy. It's even better than 'Shrek', and 'Shrek' was pretty damn good!The story follows Sully (voiced by John Goodman), a giant, furry monster, and his friend Mike Wazowski(Billy Crystal), a green eyeball with limbs. They're from 'Monstropolis', a city of monsters in another dimension and their job is to collect 'scream energy' by, you guessed it, coming out of closets (which, as we know from 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', are interdimensional portals) and making kids scream. However, there's trouble at work (kids are getting too hard to scare, rivalry with another monster) and everything really starts falling to pieces when a little toddler comes through a door into Monstropolis. Monsters are terrified of kids, whom they regard as toxic. Which is reasonable enough.The animation is gorgious, it's very funny (on different levels), fast-paced and not too sentimental either. Definitely one of the most enjoyable movies you'll ever see. Watch the end credits too: like a Jackie Chan film they're one of the highlights of the movie.8/10","Monsters, Inc."
274,Elgroovio,My favourite comedy,10,19 May 2004,"You've just got to see this film. It will have you bouncing up and down with laughter no matter what age you are. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect as the two main characters of the film Mike Wasowski and James P. Sullivan and so is the rest of the voice-cast which includes James Coburn; this must have been his last film. ""Monsters, inc."" has great jokes and great lines (Randall (the bad monster): Where's the kid you creatin; Mike: First of all it's cretin. If you're gonna threaten me you might as well do it properly). This film also has a great score written by the fabulous musician Randy Newman, and the film's song ""Wouldn't Have Nothing If I Didn't Have You"" won a well deserved Oscar. Hang around for the credits, there are some of the funniest outtakes that you will ever see in your entire life-time. But one of the most interesting things about this film is that it is really unbelievably sweet without being sickly so. Most Disney films are full of sloppy over-sentimentality but this film isn't which shows how little an influence Disney has on Pixar studios. If you want to buy this film on DVD, I strongly suggest that you get the special edition which is made up of two DVDs. It has tons of special features and watching them you will find out that the crew that made this film are really adorable people. If you are feeling miserable, this film will almost surely cheer you up. It is smart without being vulgar which I find very good; people of all ages can watch this film. Films as good as this are very rare so just see it! I drink to the health and long life of Pixar animation studios and the crew behind this film which is undeniably a comedy Classic like ""Some Like It Hot"". See this film and be prepared to experience the time of your life. And remember ""Put that thing back where it came from or so help me"".","Monsters, Inc."
275,duefiori,"Good product, Disney-wise (but Shrek is better)",9,22 April 2002,"Monsters Inc. is a good product, funny, technically well done, cheesy. In a word, Disney. By all means bring the kids, take the opportunity to be a kid yourself. The little girl is great. If you are an adult, though - well, Shrek is better. In the same way as Antz was better than Bug's Life. Disney target is obviously kids, so it lacks a bit of - um - spice? As i said, a very good PRODUCT. As in ""marketing"". Yeah, and merchandising too, of course. (A note: the best part of the movie is by far the short cartoon before it - who won the Oscar, as it was)","Monsters, Inc."

278,homer_simpson91,An excellent movie,8,7 November 2001,"Being a big fan of these type of animation movies such as TOY STORY, A BUG'S LIFE and SHREK, I had high expectations for MONSTERS INC. They were met. Not only are the computer graphics impressive, but the story is original and entertaining with moments of great action, good comedy, and even some genuinely sad parts.The voice-over chemistry between John Goodman and Billy Crystal is excellent. Like Eddie Murphy in SHREK, Billy Crystal was hilarious and definitely stole the show. Crystal seems to be ideal for voice-over work. Both the lead voices are perfect for their respective roles, and I thought James Coburn was also perfect for his character, Henry J. Waternoose.I loved the premise of the film. The idea of monsters going off to their jobs of scaring children to power their city is at the same time original and vaguely familiar. Boo is one of the most adorable characters I've seen in a long time (and Mary Gibbs, the young lady who does the voice of Boo, is equally adorable), and I LOVED the relationship which was developed between Boo and Sully (Goodman).This movie is everything an animated movie should be. It and Shrek are two of my all-time favorite animated movies, and it's hard for me to choose a favorite between the two (which is interesting, since I'm sure one of the two will win the first Oscar for an animated film this year). See this and you won't regret it. Fun for kids, adults, and teenagers like myself.9/10","Monsters, Inc."
279,Ryan_Barbakins,"A Hilarious, yet Heartfelt Experience",9,15 February 2020,"Monsters Inc is an amazing concept fueled by a common disbelief by children that a monster lives in their closet. This film gives us an explanation as to why Monsters do this in a genius concept. Mike Wazowski is an incredibly well written character with his comedy, temper, and overall comedic appearance. There are so many jokes in this film that could arguably be considered ""ironic humor.""
Monsters Inc is also a very heartfelt and emotional film. The ending, while being sad, feels like the right thing to happen. However the very last scene gives us hope for a happy, satisfying ending to the story. I really don't think a sequel can be made of this film, because the story felt so random, as if it was just a few crazy days at work. Which is exactly what this film, at its core is, which explains its genius of a concept.","Monsters, Inc."
280,Pigalina,Fantastic,10,14 September 2005,"This film is great. It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at ""Monsters, Incorporated"" gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are ""bloopers"" during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney/Pixar has to be the wave of the future.","Monsters, Inc."

(that's laughs for the new generations of illiterates out there) The only redeeming features were the excellent Pixar animation (but who needs to waste 2 hrs watching how brilliantly they animated the fur on the main monster?) and a somewhat sentimental storyline (at least at the end).,"Monsters, Inc."
283,tim777ca,"Nagging, Inc.",7,6 December 2002,"The film's advanced computer technology is certainly great to see, but Pixar artists are forgetting one thing: their characters are too talkative - almost nonstop talking from start to finish.The audiences want to see MOTION picture, especially children in non-English speaking countries. How many climaxes are there in this movie? I think only the final chase sequence is thrilling enough for most people. Cute dialogue isn't equal to good script. That's the reason I like ANTZ better than A BUG'S LIFE, and SHREK than MONSTERS, INC.I suggest Pixar filmmakers take some lessons from traditional Disney animation features. Hope to see a little improvement in their next project.","Monsters, Inc."
284,Tolbert,Best Pixar Movie Ever!,10,25 April 2006,"I saw this movie with my wife when it first came out in the theater. I remember we were running errands that day and just decided on seeing it spur-of-the moment. I don't regret that at all. I bought it as soon as it came out and a couple years later we had our first little one, a daughter (now two years old) who absolutely loves it. She lovingly asks for us to put it on all the time, she calls it ""Monsters"".There's lots to enjoy about this movie from the technology to music and of course the characters. You really can't say anything bad about it. First I gotta say that the voices were all very well picked. I get the biggest kick out of Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman). Their musical number at the end is cute too.The one thing I personally enjoy the most about it is that it finds a happy medium that you don't always see in movies geared toward kids. By that I mean that it's not dummied-down so that ""kids can understand it"" but still keeps adults entertained. It also doesn't go overboard at trying to cram a message down your throat. This is just good fun and some laughs. You can't go wrong with this one whether the kids are home or not. For those who haven't seen it yet, go and rent it.","Monsters, Inc."
285,KingCritic,Overall fun and memorable.,9,17 December 2015,"Monster's Inc is a large piece of my childhood, and probably yours too. It is original, fun, and best of all a timeless movie. It knows when to create sentiment, or laughter at the right time and how to do it. It is basically defines what makes Pixar such an amazing studio. The movies main heroes are Mike and Sully, and even though they are children scaring monsters, it is extremely glossed over because they funny, honest, and do the best for a being close to alien to them. Besides this movie containing driven and interesting characters, it tells an interesting story that kids and adults alike could enjoy. But something that I believe the movie tries to get across is this: intelligent beings are scared of what they don't understand, and exploit whatever it is to get a resource vital to them and hurt it if they can to get the resource faster and more efficiently. For instance, the movies race of monsters are scared of the humans because they are of a different world and exploit the needed resource (the child's screams) subtly, and when Randall (one of Pixar's top villains) wants to exploit the resource faster he is willing to hurt the humans. Still , you don't need to understand Monster's Inc on a deeper level to enjoy it or love its originality. This is one of my favorite movies ever, and is great for one of any age and I highly suggest watching it.","Monsters, Inc."
286,seltzer,Great story for all ages,10,21 December 2002,"It seems that most of the great cartoons have tons of visual gags to go with their scripts, and Monsters, Inc is no exception.  I loved the look of the film, and it was great adventure rendered with great comic sense.  The people at Pixar must really love what they do, they haven't sucked yet.  The monsters themselves may be a bit scary for really little kids or the more fraidy-cat prone kids, but the characters are superb.  Great fun all around and very worth seeing.","Monsters, Inc."
287,Geordie-4,Pretty entertaining,9,5 November 2001,"Well, this film is not quite Toy Story.  I found it very entertaining, but it seems odd that Monsters, Inc. is based on how many screams can be extracted from kids owing to their fear but that they turn out to be harmless.  Well, maybe this is not a problem.  But something nagged at me. Anyone else?  Well, apart from this I found it v. entertaining. 
John Goodman voices Sully, the best scarer in town and Billy Crystal does his best friend and partner, Mike Mozkowski.  They have been told that kids are dangerous, but when a kid escapes during a scare, Sulley learns they aren't.  Of course he has to keep the kid under wraps in order to avoid panicking the city.  This has some overtones that might disturb folks in the wake of Sept. 11.  So Sulley learns of a plot by his rival, Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) to trap a kid and keep them in Monstropolis so that there will never be an energy crisis.  Boo, the kids that Sulley ends up with is caught in the middle of this and Mike and Sulley want to save her from the nefarious Boggs and the CEO of Monsters Inc.  Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who is incahoots on this plan with Boggs.  Sulley and Mike manage to get Boo home and avoid capture by Boggs.  I was sitting too near the front of the theater to be able to honestly appraise the look of the film.  I still have a crick in my neck from looking up.  But it looked fairly dynamic and alive.  I thought John Goodman was terrific in endowing his character with a lot of kindness and gentleness. Billy Crystal's voice I hardly recognized, but he was great too.  There was great variety in the nature of the monsters.  Very cute.  I didn't find the story quite as compelling, perhaps for the reason I mentioned at the beginning of this review.  But nevertheless, this is still quite a lot of fun.  The look, the sound, the attention to detail, the sound, it's all there.  Another strong Pixar flic.","Monsters, Inc."
288,freakezette,"Wonderful movie, Another triumph for Pixar",9,25 November 2001,"Well, I thought that Shrek was going to run away with the best animated movie title for 2001, but those magical computers over at Pixar has delivered another great movie. It has the fun fantasy aspect of Shrek without sacrificing it's originality for a barrage of pop-culture references or it's good family values for gross and crude jokes.Monsters Inc creates a whole new world that somewhat parallels out own world, only the inhabitants are a variety of monsters, most of which work at Monsters Inc., a factory that collects screams, the source of power for Monsterland (or whatever it's called). The greatest scarer is Sully, a fairly cuddly furry blue monster, who rooms with his little round green friend, Mike Wakowski. But the world is turned upside down when a little 3-year-old, Boo, invades monster land.Everything is so imaginative in this movie. Even with just an eye, an eyebrow and a mouth, Mike's character is so expressive and fun. His girlfriend, Celia, who has medusa hair has snakes that share the same emotion as Celia. But as great as the character design is, it's the heart of the characters like Sully, Mike and Boo that make this movie such a great family flick. Best of all, both kids and adults can enjoy it. Kids will love the colorful characters and the action scenes, adults with love the references and the creative aspects of this movie.A 9 out of 10","Monsters, Inc."
289,magic_marker,"Ooh, the sweetest thing",9,7 September 2002,"Quentin Tarantino once claimed (In a deleted scene from ""Pulp Fiction"") that there were only two kinds of people in the world; Elvis people and Beatles people. You could love both, but eventually you had to make a decision. Now there appears to be a new societal division forming- between ""Shrek"" people and ""Monsters Inc."" people. Now I love ""Shrek;"" it had moments of real wit and its target (the Disney empire) was long overdue for a thrashing. But ultimately I was left cold by it. The reason? It was afraid to be a fairy tale. It is true that young people nowadays would not respond well to fairy tales; Disney has transformed  fairy tales into something toxic and false, so new ways of telling them have to be invented. ""Shrek"" told a basic fairy tale story, but peppered it with post-modern references and nudge-nudge jokes to make it clear to is jaded and cynical young audience that it didn't REALLY believe in any of it, it was just having fun. That is, I think, the easy way out.""Monsters Inc."" (Which is officially a Disney film but is actually made by the far more innovative studio Pixar) chooses a harder route; to tell a fairy tale straight, but in a way modern audiences will appreciate. In this, they succeeded masterfully.The plot of ""Monsters Inc."" is well known by now. In the city of Monstropolis, which is pretty much like any city you know except that it is populated by monsters of all shapes and sizes, children's screams are the only source of power. To obtain them, the power company Monsters Inc sends professional scarers through a network of trans-dimensional doors into children's closets around the world. The rules of the job are strict; no children or even children's clothing must come into contact with a monster, for there is nothing more dangerous than the touch of a human child. The company's top scarer is ""Sulley"" Sullivan (John Goodman), who with his partner Mike (Billy Crystal) is in a contest with the number 2 scarer, the evil chameleon Randall Boggs (Buschemi, playing it smooth instead of whiny for a change) to break the all time scream record. However, Randall is actually engaged in a shady plan that involves one of his assigned kids. When that plan backfires and the kid ends up in Monstropolis, Sulley is left alone to deal with her, and with the utter chaos that ensues.
There is so much to love in this film, but I must draw attention to the relationship between Sulley and the child, who he nicknames ""Boo."" Somehow, and truly I am at a loss to explain it, the scriptwriters, animators and actors pulled off the amazing feat of making the relationship touching without being nauseatingly sweet. Boo is the most adorable little kid in animaiton history, and I think the reason for this is that she was actually voiced by a real three-year old, and not by some affected adult (After all, what do adults really know about what it is like to be three?). The scriptwriters got her to say some incredibly funny things, but her innocence makes them funnier, since she is not trying to be self-aware. John Goodman is wonderful at conveying Sulley's gradually mounting affection for the little tyke, making it more humourous and moving by spicing it with some understandable aggrivation.I loved the reference to Tex Avery's legendary animated short ""Feed the Kitty,"" (Which must have heavily influenced the filmmakers; Boo also calls Sulley ""kitty""), and this film has plenty more to entertain- particularly some wonderfully designed snow sequences and a virtiguous closet door chase that is one of the best ever. ""Monsters Inc"" is a film I will watch again, and from me, that is high praise.","Monsters, Inc."
290,bardia-moose,Rewatchable Pixar classic.,9,30 September 2014,"I fell in love with Monster,Inc. the first time I saw it as a kid. It was the movie I got most excited for to watch, fast forward eleven years and I still get excited for it. This monster world is so different from what we know yet so interesting and fun. Their source of power comes from the screams of children which seems so very strange but in the context of this film, makes perfect sense. I am never forced to accept anything the film throws at me, I choose to accept them because they make sense. Another important reason for why I love Monsters, Inc. is the characters. James P. Sullivan is our protagonist. He is very good at his job, known to many as the top Scarer in Monstropolis. Throughout this film, Sullivan's perspective on everything changes while his caring and comforting character grows stronger. His best friend and roommate, Mike Wazowski, is a funny and smart character who sometimes fails to see the obvious. He is full of energy and charisma, making it impossible for me to dislike him. Apart from the characters and the beautiful chemistry they share, the story is very well written and enjoyable. It had some hilarious laugh out loud moments, but also some very sad ones. The 3-D is okay, but seems non-existent at times. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet must do so, and those who have should go back and revisit it. It's the well written story, the colorful characters and the heart this film carries that makes it such a timeless classic.","Monsters, Inc."
291,Nahret,Aaah! Real Monsters!,9,5 July 2002,"Hooray! A new Pixar! And it's a scream. Literally. You see, there ARE monsters living in our closets. Well, not precisely living there, but they do come through the closet door to collect children's screams which they need to power their city, Monstropolis. Of course, little kids are also said to be highly toxic to monsters, so those are just as afraid of children as vice versa. Imagine the panic when it transpires that one of those disease-carrying creatures is loose in Monstropolis. Aahh!After Shrek upped the ante in CGI technology, Disney and Pixar could not well sit back and let Dreamworks have the first Animated Oscar without a fight. As a result, they surpassed everybody's expectations - and Shrek - by a long shot. The got the wake-up call in time, and - even if the Academy Awards tell us otherwise - this round goes to Disney. Much of the success of this movie is, of course, the merit of the voice cast. Like Billy Crystal came to realise, Mike Wazowski may be green, bald and not even have a profile, but he clearly walks like Crystal, talks like Crystal, IS Crystal. Sulley is a very lovable monster and hero (he's welcome in my closet any time), while Boo is just adorable. And then there's Steve Buscemi's evil slimy rotten villain of a lizard... In short, this is not only animated feature at its best, this is a well conceived film with a solid story and well fleshed-out characters. On top of that, the people at Pixar chose to go the extra mile in giving us a couple of hilarious take-outs after the credits. You can't possibly ask for more.","Monsters, Inc."
292,stevenleadbetter,Not much new to chew on here.,5,10 November 2001,"I have been heard to mention my anticipation of this title in recent weeks. Now that I have finally got my peepers on it, I have to say that it wasn't really my cup of tea. I have a three-year-old son who is difficult to please as far as his entertainment is concerned and, suffice to say, he lost interest in this within half an hour. He adores Toy Story 2 and Tarzan, and can watch them (and has) repeatedly. The fear that a large proportion of ticket-buyers have come to view the now obligatory Attack Of The Clones' trailer is well founded it seemed, with large numbers of the audience leaving before the commencement of the movie. This may account for it's auspicious first weekend record-breaking figures. Anyhow, Star Wars aside. Monsters Inc is very pretty, very cute, very Disney, very Pixar. I first heard about it after buying the Tigger Movie DVD for my son. It seemed quite brilliant at the time, what little I gleaned from the all too brief trailer. I won't ruin the plot for you, but it is basically Toy Story with different characters. Instead of toys that secretly lead a life away from their owners, we now have monsters that are thought of as figments of the child's imaginings. They survive off the screams of children and around the clock they sneak through children's closet, and scare the bejeezus out of them. (Some have more success than others) Billy Crystal and John Goodman are excellent as the main protagonists but the rest of the characters are second rate and fail to inspire any feeling about them. There is a scene reminiscent of Toy Story 2 (Sorry to harp back to this again, it is difficult not to when both films or so similar) when Woody and the gang are trying to save Jessie at the Airport, jumping from suitcase to suitcase. This time we have a countless collection of doors which are used to enter the bedroom of the children the monsters scare, thousands of them hanging from conveyors. This makes for an entertaining chase, but it's been done before, as has most of the movie really. Perhaps some insight from Nick Park or the rest of Aardman Animation would be of some benefit, as their films are quite astonishing in their originality and timing. A picture that is immense fun, but as a wisened old Disney buff, I feel it is more of the same immense fun that we have seen many times before.","Monsters, Inc."

The monsters in the movie were cool and also they have some abilities like bursting fire etc. I like the factory which is named ""Monsters, Inc."", because it is big and awesome. Sulley was the best scarer in the factory. Boo was the cutest in the movie. At the beginning of the movie, all the scarers, scare the children to generate electricity, that scene were totally awesome. When, the machines are crushing the garbage and sulley thinks it crushing Boo also, that time Sulley's expressions makes it funny. The Himalayas which comes in the movie was wonderful because it was very white and plain, it was superb. The Monster costume which was worn by Boo was super and it was a good idea. Randall Boggs look like a pucca villain. Even, the Background Music which comes in between the movie was super. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Monsters, Inc.""","Monsters, Inc."

This must be done in order for them to collect screams, which can be then converted to energy. However it is a tough job since children are considered highly lethal so when a child hops into their world all hell brakes loose.You'll love Monsters Inc. if: You like good animated movies that bring out your inner child. Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. deals with quite an original concept by bringing to life an imaginary aspect of most people's childhood. The movie has very good visuals and sound, its Pixar after all and it has some very good voice actors, (excellent choice on the main ones). Monsters Inc. while not the greatest animation of all time will entertain you the first or second time you'll watch it.You'll hate Monsters Inc. if: You expected to laugh more or if you expected some originality in terms of story progression. While the main concept is VERY original, the execution is quite typical. What starts as something very interesting ends up being a boring good vs. evil chase, where everything is predictable as hell. Most importantly though I didn't laugh that's my main problem the film just wasn't funny. I always watch animated films with my girlfriend since we both love them and all that happened was: Me snickering in the first 10 minutes of the movie and my girlfriend laughing each time that cute 3-year old girl would do something cute and adorable this isn't comedy, it was just an entertaining movie to pass the time.FINAL VERDICT: Toy Story Knew Better (6.3/10)[+] An original concept. Good animation and voice acting.[-] Good characters, but a tad forgettable. Not funny.

299,dbn3,"Beautiful, but Soulless (6/10)",6,13 January 2002,"(I saw this in the theater, YMMV)Let's start with what makes this movie stand out from the crowd -- Pixar's rendering of the big blue furry monster, Sulley.  I am in complete awe of what Pixar has accomplished with rendering Sulley.  My mouth fell open and my head spun during a scene where Sulley is lying on the ground in a snowstorm.  Lying in the snow with all of his fur waving in the wind and the snowflakes flying by and getting caught in his fur.  Spectacular. Amazing. Probably took months of the entire processing power of every computer on the west coast to render that scene.Other than that, there ain't much else to recommend this movie.  I didn't care one whit about any of the characters in this movie.  None of them, not even Boo, the little girl.  She was soooo precious and soooo fearless that she was completely unbelievable.  In addition, there is seemingly a new rule mandating the use of a rollercoaster-like scene in every computer animated movie.  If you like that kind of stuff, you won't be disappointed.  The rollercoaster-like scene in Monsters, Inc. seems to go on forever, and starts to feel like just another gimmick to show off how smart those programmers are.Monsters, Inc. is a wonderful demonstration for the technical wizardry at Pixar, but it just never quite makes it as a movie.","Monsters, Inc."
300,ReviewingHistory,"Uniquely Funny, Extraordinarily Creative",9,8 August 2020,"Creative, funny, extraordinary and unique.

Sulley and Mike change and are changed by their affection for Boo. Boo (i.e., Mary) is an adorable character who draws out empathy even from monstrous souls. That empathy is precisely the fate that takes hold of frightening monsters, who were once drawn to generating screams out of children, but then, after Boo, are transformed into heartwarming creatures to children.

303,cinefreakdude,My favorite animated movie,10,28 June 2011,"Monster's Inc. is just pure brilliance. Not only is it my favorite animated film of all time, but it's one of my top 5 movies ever. In my opinion, it's Pixar's best, and why Shrek beat it for best animated feature at the Academy Awards - well I'll never understand that idiocy. The jokes are screamingly (no pun intended) funny, and the dialog is one of my favorite ever. I love every single character (Mike is my favorite), and all the voice acting is superb. The animation is fantastic and the cool twist on ""the monster in the closet"" is fun and very clever. One of my favorite scenes is when Mike and his girlfriend Celia are on a date at Harryhausens (a restaurant in Monstropolis) and Sully comes in with Boo and unintentionally crashes their date and Boo gets loose, it's hilarious havoc, and I love every minute, and of course every other scene in Monster's Inc. Like I said before, I love this movie, it's hilarious, creative, original, featuring awesome characters, this is a great film that everyone can enjoy. Also it was one of the first movies I ever saw, so it has a special effect on me, and always will. my rating: ********** 10/10 stars","Monsters, Inc."
304,Laner,I wonder if everyone was watching the same movie...,9,22 September 2002,"I've read a lot of the reviews here, and was surprised at the (admittedly few) negative responses.  I honestly can't imagine how anyone could dislike Monsters, Inc.  It may not be the Greatest Movie Ever(tm), but without a doubt continues the string of home runs Pixar has been hitting since Toy Story.Excellent casting, plot, humor, animation - all of it is top-notch.""Boo"" may irritated by those who are easily annoyed by the stereotypical ""precocious child"" characters, but honestly... the movie isn't about her. The overarching plot is the friendship of Sully and Mike Wazowski... Boo is simply the wedge that is driven between these two lifelong friends.I too agree with the sentiment that Pixar was robbed at the Oscars this year.  While Shrek was excellent, Pixar deserved it more - not just for Monsters, Inc. but for their previous works as well (which Shrek owes a huge debt of gratitude)","Monsters, Inc."
305,harshbhagat-26001,Love these monsters!!,8,14 August 2019,"It's a lovely film filled with a whole new world of charming characters mainly in Boo the kid, Sully And Mike. They being the central characters bring so much charm in this movie. Its a whole new world out there with these scary looking monsters. The animation, the camerawork and the characterisation is pitch perfect. Infact its my favourite animated movies now right up there with Toystory. Magnificent. 8/10","Monsters, Inc."
306,Carol_cc,Loli and the Beast,7,7 July 2020,"The music is so touching. The idea of the story is magical: when children say there are monsters in the closet, they actually do; and behind the closet door, there is a whole new world of monsters.","Monsters, Inc."
307,meet_the_feebles,"Peoples, INC.",8,2 November 2001,"Monsters, INC. is a great movie that almost works at the same level the TOY STORY movies and SHREK does (I only compare it to them because it's an all computer animated film). Watching this movie I got increasingly jealous that I wasn't a kid. This is one of the cutest movies in HISTORY!!!!! The gags, while mostly for kids hold there own in the adult world, not as tightly as SHREK did, but it works. The sappiness of the movie is drained out by the pure charm of it. Every time I hear PIXAR is making a movie I get as excited as a Star Wars fan about EPISODE II (in which teaser trailer shows up here). While it probably won't turn as many heads as TOY STORY 2 and SHREK, it will be noticed. PIXAR is by far the MOST imaginative studio out there, they cover EVER corner of what would seem to be a CARTOON to make it it's own world! It was almost as if the writers had went into a closet that was left opened by a monster and explored their world and got to know every little crack and stain about the place, then came back here and made a movie about it. I don't want to talk about the goings on of the film because everything is  such a sweet and intelligent surprise. Most of all, it should be noted that I was in the theater with a BUNCH of screaming, talking, loud children, and in any other case I would have been annoyed but MONSTERS, INC. put me in such a cute and loving mood that I couldn't wait to hear the next little kids say, ""Is that man real?"" MONSTERS, INC. ***1/2 (out of ****)","Monsters, Inc."
308,jtana1,For everyone,7,19 February 2020,"This proposal is interesting, being monsters I liked, I found it funny and funny, only that the character of the girl 'Boo' at some times already tired me a little, I do not know why, I was not captivated as many.The colors and image quality were incredible, it is quite enjoyed, although the soundtrack does not stand out so much.I recommend the film to anyone who has not yet seen it, it will be a good time, but I think that if they had not included humans it would be much better.","Monsters, Inc."
309,Scottie-3,Its heart outshines its technical achievements... as it should,6,7 November 2001,"""Monsters, Inc"" is essentially about embracing your fears, andlearning to laugh at them. A very timely message, don't you think?It's true that the little girl is absolutely adorable (but notsaccharine), but the heart of the film is the growing relationshipbetween Sully (big furry blue monster, voice by John Goodman)and this pre-verbal little girl he calls ""Boo."" At first, she's sort of apet that he's apprehensive about. Predictably, she becomes much,much more to him. Sully learns to be a father.This movie made me cry. And laugh. It does have some laggingmoments, and isn't quite on par with ""A Bug's Life"" or ""Toy Story 2,""but it's darned good. (I've never been a big fan of the original ""ToyStory,"" which seemed more concerned with ""gee-whiz-look-what-we-can-do-with-computers,"" rather than storyand character, at which the subsequent Pixar films have excelled.)Technically, it's years ahead of ""Shrek,"" which, in my opinion,offered nothing beyond lifelike-looking characters (whonevertheless do not move in a lifelike fashion) and a dash of hipcynicism. Watch this movie and notice that the characters move ina completely convincing way, that fur and hair behave as they do inlife, but that the movie does not call attention to it. ""Monsters, Inc.""is concerned with more important things.","Monsters, Inc."
310,ajk718,pixar has done it again!,10,8 May 2006,"another animated masterpiece by pixar! i actually saw this movie recently when it was shown on the Disney channel, but this was the only time i saw it. unfortunately, i didn't get to see it when it was out in theaters. pixar has made several excellent animated films and monsters inc is surely not an exception. monster inc. is set in the ever famous scream factory where monsters access doors that lead into the rooms of little children in order to scare them while they are sleeping. the screams that result from these children is the energy that makes light bulbs glow and cars drive in the world in which the monster's live. however, trouble and madness ensues when Sulley, the number one frightener, accidentally lets a human child into the monster world. ironically, the monsters are extremely terrified of these kids that they scare routinely because of the belief that all of them are poisonous and carry loads of diseases. However, Sulley and his fellow monster friend, Mike, discover that Boo (the name which they had given to the child) is really very harmless. throughout the movie, sulley and mike attempt to keep boo hidden until tehy can get her back into her door and asleep in her room. however, this is not as easy as they might think!","Monsters, Inc."
311,jjgreatwhite,One of the most Likable Animated Movies of all time,10,18 August 2021,"If I had to describe Monsters Inc. For one word for me it would be likable, it's just such an easy movie to like from the story, to the humor, and to the characters this is just such an easy movie to like. First of all while it is a reusable concept of monsters scaring kids while hiding in their closet they add a twist that they need to power there world with screams and it adds why in a sense while it's wrong to scare kids you see why they do it it's just their job. The next reason why this movie is so likable is the humor which in my personal opinion this is easily Pixar's funniest movie with hilarious running gags, great one liners, and just funny situations for the characters to be in. The final reason why this movie is so likable are the characters Mike and Sulley are such a likable duo with different personalities to compare and contrast to one another and their friendship is fantastic also with Boo the girl who they accidentally left out is not annoying and is funny and adorable together and also there are tons of great characters in this movie to count but I would be here all day telling people what I like about each of them. In the end Monsters Inc. Is a personal favorite of mine because it's just such an easy to like and to rewatch and it is without a doubt in my opinion one of Pixar's best movies. Overall grade= A+.","Monsters, Inc."

Mike and Sully keep her and treat her like a daughter. Sully call's her Boo. Boo likes to draw pictures for Sully. But then they go in this door room. Mike,Sully and Boo go in one door.

Their company is collecting children's scream because it becomes an energy source in their town. They scare children but in fact monsters are afraid of human's children. One day human's girl wandered into monster's city so Sally and Mike try to take back to her home.This movie in one of my favorite film because the story is interesting. This film has thrilling scenes, interesting scenes, moving scenes and give me courage scenes. This movie was opened to the public when I was six years old. Since then I am watching it many times. Characters are so cute and I think they are unusual. I like Sally and the girl named Boo in particular because Sally has a tender heart and he is a warm-hearted monster. And Boo is very cute so she is forgiven if she does bad thing. Pictures are so beautiful and easy to understand so everyone, from child to adult, can enjoy watching this movie.This movie's conclusion is happy ending because their wish was fulfilled. this movie is so nice.","Monsters, Inc."
316,WordtwisterMN,"Nothing funny, with no surprises.",2,27 November 2002,"This movie is often compared to Shrek.  I found no comparisons but for the main character and the animated look. This movie offers a story line spread so thinly that it tore within the first 30 minutes.  I didn't laugh once in the first hour before I decided to get up and write how boring this movie is.  The little girl is cute, but offers no surprises, and has very little attitude for supposedly a scary presence.  The monsters remind me of the blue-collar characters from the row houses of Baltimore.  The viewer is not allowed any kind of reference to any of the monsters past or their future. The entire movie is predictable, boring and difficult to watch. You will not likely run across anyone that says they have watched this movie multiple times as they did with Shrek.  I give it a 2 of 10, and advise anyone that expects to see anything mythical, creative, or enchanting to avoid this movie.There's not even one good line in Monsters Inc.  Remember from Shrek..""Yes. The ginger-bread man!""..gurgle gurgle..  Shrek set the barometer for the future of animated movies with stories.","Monsters, Inc."

318,JehuDVD,"The CU Film Critic takes on ""Monsters, Inc.""",8,26 October 2001,"Whether you love or hate what's been making its way out of Walt Disney Studios for the past four years or so, one thing's for sure.  Walt's gotta be rolling around in his cryogenic chamber.Since `The Lion King,' with the exception of the `Toy Story' films, Disney's animated films have been going downhill in a hurry, on a slippery slope to the pit where we find such cartoon masterpieces as `Rock-a-Doodle' and `The Secret of Nimh 2: Timmy to the Rescue.'That said, it would be nice for the folks at Disney to bring back the animated musical as we know it before Dreamworks' Jeffrey Katzenberg drops them with the film industry equivalent of a Stone Cold Stunner.THAT said, the newest computer-animated film by the geniuses at Disney/Pixar is the most fun I've had at the theatre since last spring.  `Monsters, Inc.' is a tale of blue-collar workers who just happen to be blessed with such distinguishing characteristics as purple fur, antennae, horns, etc.Apparently, in the world of monsters (which may very well be Greeley, judging from various hints we're given), electrical power is all driven by one source- the screams of small children.  If you've spent any time in a church-sponsored preschool, this concept won't come as a big surprise.  Of course, in order to harness this power, myriad creatures are employed at Monsters, Incorporated, to enter our world through childrens' closet doors and collect these shrieks of terror to be put to use at the power plant.As my fourteen year-old sister would say, `How cool is that?'We get the voice of John `Walter' Goodman as James P. Sullivan (Sully, for short), an enthusiastic ogre of sorts with blue fur, a big smile, and horns. Imagine Bigfoot after two weeks at Wonka's chocolate factory, and you've got a pretty good idea.Sully is the perpetual Employee of the Month at Monsters, Inc., spending all his free time boning up on job skills, and constantly breaking `scare records' with his patented system.  His best friend and manager is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a one-eyed, green gumdrop with harms and legs. Wazowski is the monster equivalent of George from `Seinfeld,' slightly neurotic but goofy enough to be fun.When the two buddies inadvertently let a child into the monster world, catastrophe ensues.  Children, of course, are considered toxic to monsters, making the job of scream collectors even more hazardous.  This attracts the attention of the scheming villain Randall, voiced by none other than the devil himself, Steve Buscemi.Cartoons, computer-generated or not, don't get much better than this. Cartoons are all about fun, and you won't have more fun at any other movie this fall.  It's great.  The monsters' names are Mike, George, and the like. The animation is top-notch.  Shrek has nothing on this film.  I sat hypnotized for a good eight minutes of the movie, captivated by the incredible detail what was given to various clumps of blue fur.  A guest appearance by the Abominable Snowman made me roll out of my chair (upon presenting his guests with yellow sno-cones, he reassures them, `they're lemon.').Also, this is Disney, so keep an eye out for cameos by characters from other films.  I counted three.  See if you can do me one better.  `Monsters, Inc.' may not have been part of Walt Disney's vision, but I get the feeling he at least would have approved.  Want one more reason to go see this movie? Five words.  `Star Wars Episode II Trailer.'It's high time a family movie makes its way to the top.  I'm gonna endorse this one with an `A.'","Monsters, Inc."

Simply amazing, marvellous filmmaking.The animation is picture-perfect, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is truly original. Pixar's finest, I think, it's way better than Finding Nemo.

I thought the story line about childhood demons of the subconscious  was somewhat disturbing in a surreal, David Lynch-esque sort of way... Obviously, the animation was the best of any film to date. I hope that Dreamworks makes enough movie from their (superior film) SHREK that they can attain the level of Pixar's animation.Sully's fur was phenomenal, my jaw literally dropped at the first few moments it was displayed, and then later during the Himalayan scenes when refraction of snow and ice, and the influence of wind came into play.

Monsters, Inc. employees generate their city's power by targeting and scaring children, but they are themselves afraid that children may contaminate them. When one child, Boo, enters Monsters, Inc., Mike and Sulley must return her. Sulley and Mike overcome a lot of difficulties to return her. It is the highlight of the film.

I watched it with him the first time and can honestly say that I think I laughed more than he did. It's very well done and the casting is spot on. I never cease to be amazed at the technical genius that creates these computer generated movies. You can actually see the indiviual strands of fur on the monsters' bodies moving as they move. Amazing. However, great effects don't make this film, it's got an interesting premise and the dialogue has enough humour to appeal to us oldies. The story moves along briskly and it has a nice child-friendly happy ending (something we mothers like to see)I'm only sorry that I've now watched it about 200 times so it's beginning to pall.","Monsters, Inc."
325,Einsiedeln,One of the five finest films of 2001.,9,3 November 2001,"Exciting, humorous, longing, tension-filled, cute... Pixar's new ""Monsters Inc."" covers an enormous range of emotions in the course of its hour-and-a-half running time.  Frankly, it feels quite a bit longer than that -- the movie absolutely draws you in.John Sullivan (""Sully"" - voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Koslowski (voiced by, of all people, Billy Crystal!) are the top ""scaring"" team at Monsters Inc. -- a major company in another dimension, where the society is powered by the energy contained in kids' screams.  To ensure that there is power to run Monstropolis' everyday society, the Monsters need to keep scaring kids and getting those screams -- ""We scare because we care"" is the corporate slogan, showing that M.I. is the driving force behind that dimension's economy and society.Close behind Sully and Mike, though, is the treacherous Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a multi-limbed chameleon-like monster with a scheme to top Sully and Mike and keep the company in the black.  Naturally, things start to go wrong when a human child from the other side manages to get into the Monster's dimensions... particularly since common knowledge holds that kids are actually toxic and poisonous to monsters!You'll gasp in awe, you'll be convulsed with laughter, and you'll smile sadly at the amazing visions, witty humor, and brilliant storyline.  I cannot recommend this film enough; I'd go see it multiple times at full price in the theaters.(This is, of course, helped by the ""introductory"" animation -- a hilarious piece called ""For the Birds"".  *grin*)P.S. - my guess is that Pixar put together their standard run of ""bloopers"" for the film, to be run during the credits, but are holding the new credits back a month or so to get people to come and see the film again during the Christmas season.  I'm pretty certain I will!","Monsters, Inc."
326,fepp,Wonderful animated movie!,10,4 March 2002,"This movie is just plain wonderful! Incredibly funny, told with a great tempo and with a lot of humour.  No dead moments at all!  The story is based on a single assumptions, that monsters in the closet are real, and that they scare little kids in order to get energy to power their city.  From this assumption, a wonderful story about a big threat to this lifestyle and kids everywhere is spun. On the visual nitpicking side, the computer animations are better than earlier attempts like Toy Story, but they are still somewhat deficient when it comes to humans. The hair on the main character Sulley is superb, and there is a wonderful sleighride scene with swirling snow that is exquisite! However, the humans are still doll-like, and the complexity of human hair has not been handled.  Most of the monsters look like slightly soft rubber, which is a bit disappointing... for some reason, it does not look quite right (except for the furry monsters).But the movie does not depend on the computer generated graphics to entertain, it would have been just as much fun if it had been handdrawn the old way.  Computer graphics allow for more dramatic pans and roller-coaster rides, and are good enough not to detract from the action, which is quality enough. Here in Sweden, there was a short movie about birds before the main movie, which was just wonderfully hilarious.  It would be very nice to see more of that kind; little animated movies are definitely fun before the main course!","Monsters, Inc."

328,RawkStah,It's from PIXAR. They know funny and CGI.,7,1 November 2001,"Monsters, Inc. ***Parents  you might want to make sure that your kids don't read the next sentence.  The monster in your closet is REAL.That monster is big and scary and is gonna make you scream and is gonna keep on doing it until you grow up.  Tough.  That's the way it is.  But, don't think that it actually WANTS to scare you.  It's not mean, it's just doing it's job.  See, that monster works for Monsters, Inc.  Monsters, Inc. supplies all the power to Monstropolis, and your screams provide that power. Sadly, you haven't been doing your job lately.  You're growing up too fast. You don't scare easily.  And, because of that, Monstropolis is in an energy crunch.  So, when that big scary monster shows up tonight, make sure that you scream really, really loud.  Just don't touch the monster.  Children are toxic.  You don't want to hurt the monster, do you?You might want to take a quick break and calm your children down now. Reality is tough.Much like the Toy Story franchise, Monsters, Inc. presents us with a look into a secret world.  A world of monsters.  Guess what?  Those monsters are just like us, but not in a Twilight Zone episode kind of way.  More like the going to work, having friends and families kind of way.  Unlike most of us, however, the monsters are computer generated.Synopsis time:  Monsters, Inc. is roughly a day in the life of James P. `Sully' Sullivan (Goodman), and his friend Mike Wazowski (Crystal). They're best friends, roommates, and partners at Monsters, Inc. (`We scare because we care.')  Sully does the actual scare-jobs, while Mike is, for lack of a better term, his crew chief.  Mike handles the logistics, the paperwork (poorly), and everything else not involving the actual scaring of the children.  Sully is the top scarer in the company, followed closely by Randall Boggs (Buscemi)  a sort-of cross between a gecko, a chameleon and a snake.  The head of Monsters, Inc. is Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn), a crab thing.  Waternoose is concerned both about the current energy crisis and about the quality of the new scarers.  They're just not all that scary, and tend to be just a little stupid and/or clumsy.  Waternoose wants Sully to help train the new recruits, Randall wants to be in first place, and Mike just wants to make Celia (Tilly), a mix between Medusa and a cyclops, his girlfriend.  Mike is in a hurry to get on his date with Celia and, once again, forgets to file his paperwork.  Sully decides to do it for him. Mike left the paperwork on his desk on the Scarefloor.Now, the mechanism by which the monsters emerge from a closet is this: a child's ID card is scanned into a computer.  An automated system then summons up the other' side of the closet door in that child's bedroom. The door is inserted into a slot on the Scarefloor, power is applied to the door, a storage battery is attached to a receptical next to the door, the monster goes into the door, scares the kid, and comes out.  No doors are supposed to be on the Scarefloor after the end of a shift.  But, guess what Sully finds?  He peeks into the bedroom, to make sure no monsters are present before he shuts the door down (so he doesn't trap the monster). But, a big problem arises  the little girl (Biggs) that has that closet comes out, and into Monstropolis.  This is not good.  This is one of the worst things that could happen.  And, she really likes Sully, whom she renames Kitty.  Her name is Boo, at least according to Sully.  Begin wackiness in T minus 3... 2... 1... make audience laugh now!Overall, Monsters, Inc. is very well done.  Then again, it was done by the same people behind the Toy Story franchise and A Bug's Life.  And, it's certainly in the same vein.  The writing is tight, the pacing is perfect, and the characters are entertaining.  Most importantly, it won't make grown-ups stupider or bored.  There are times when the movie is a bit dark in tone, but not too much, and certainly not too intense for kids.As far as the animation goes, well, it's PIXAR, for the love of pete!  It started off as a subsidiary of Industrial Light and Magic.  Of course it's going to be outstanding.  However, the competition is tougher in 2001 than it was in the late 90s.  Square Pictures Final Fantasy raised the bar considerably in terms of what can be done with computer animation.  Sully is a hairy monster.  Hair all over.  It's so close to being done right that you can just feel it, but it's not perfect.  It's not distracting, but it's not quite perfect.  Yet.  But, in terms of the light-sourcing and the physics' that the monsters obey, it's dead on.  Same with the facial expressions. Even though Boo looks like a plastic toy (this could be by design, of course, since it's intended to be cartoony, while Final Fantasy went for realism), the range of emotions she's capable of displaying is amazing. Then again, PIXAR was able to make a desk lamp convey emotion (in the groundbreaking Luxo, Jr.).  You're not going to go wrong with seeing Monsters, Inc.","Monsters, Inc."

Monsters, Inc. is everythingI've come to expect from a Pixar movie: a clever story told with themost stunning digital animation there is. Pixar has never beforeallowed its animation skill to carry the film, and this movie is noexception. The monsters children see in their closets and undertheir beds are real, but they are more scared of the children thanthe children are of them. You see, it turns out children are highlytoxic to the monsters of Monstropolis. These gentle critters -- theproduct of animator's wild imaginations -- are harvesting energyfrom human children's screams. The plot turns around the suddenappearance of Boo, a small human child, who accidentally findsher way through the closet into Monstropolis. As the story unfolds,the kids and the monsters learn more about irrational fear andtrust -- certainly a lesson well suited for an America afterSeptember 11. As is Pixar's tradition, they created a wonderful animated short thatruns before Monsters, Inc. Birds of a Feather had me in tears oflaughter about 60 seconds. This alone was well worth the $8.50admission price.","Monsters, Inc."

I have to say that as a Pixar / Disney movie it lacked something from the pervious Toy Stories, but at first I could not quite put my finger on the problem. However after reviewing other digital movie I now can see the main problem. Lets start with Titan A.E. digital quality mostly excellent, however no realism in most scenes, other then the people which often seemed cartoonish. Final Fantasy, very, very good graphics the people very real, although the surrounding environment, was the Fantasy. Now Shrek not commenting on the story line, the environment from the grass to the buildings were just perfect, and put the unreal characters in a setting which MADE them real, so we felt that the film was real. Toy Story 1 & 2, again especially in the 2nd the environment was perfect, also because it was in a place which we all recognises (an average city) it made everything seem real. Now finally Monsters Inc, the graphics were another step up from Toy Story 2, however all the realism was gone. This was because of where the film was set, take the scene where Sulley and Wazowski are walking down the street, on the way they pass funny cars, a Jelly Monster, and a giant and you feel that the realism we got in Toy Story is lost. Having said that the world they created was very funny, and for a change you could feel in the graphics Disney's involvement, leading to many cartoonish environments, with a Pixar's touch. Having said all that this film was brilliant, and the graphics on the little girl Boo' we excellent. I could comment on the fact that the story line is very predicable, but it's aimed at kids and so is very easy for them to understand. As I said earlier it is a very funny movie, with a lot more comedy then Toy Story had. All the characters have certain funny quirks and mannerisms, which adds to the laughs. Also I have to say that although John Goodman did a very good job as Sulley, for me Billy Crystal made the movie his own, as the voice of Wazowski bringing more then an extra dimension to the character. Although I have to say I didn't for some reason connect to the characters as I did with Toy Story, but that could just be me. Another thing that I have to point out is the ending, well after the ending, like Toy Story 2 there's funny outtakes, but then there more and takes credits to another level. I would recommend people to go and see the movie just to see the end, and was still sitting even when the screen went black waiting for more. Well to wrap up this review this film has style, great humour, a fine plot for kids, great graphics and more, yes go and see it.","Monsters, Inc."
334,jonnydmullan,Animation at its finest,9,5 April 2020,"Monsters Inc, like Toy Story is also a genius concept. The film works off the premise that children's bedroom closet doors operate as portals that allow monsters through them to scare them and obtain the energy released in the scream to fuel the monster world. I have no idea how this concept was thought up but it sets the movie up for a home run.These characters have fully realised and developed personalities. We see that their decisions have actual consequences and they feel more than one way about the events. We see internal conflict and for a movie animated ""lovable"" monsters, that is really impressive.The chase scene at the end is staged and paced perfectly. Great story telling and really entertaining watching. It made me fall in love with these characters and really get on board with what they were trying to do. It culminates to a denouement that is satisfying, well thought out and fully rounded.Monsters Inc is Pixar doing what it does best.","Monsters, Inc."
335,athaggard,"Hilarious, Smart, and Heartwarming",9,13 July 2019,"It has a creative plot of monsters scaring children so that they can power their city and how they work in an office environment. The characters, animation, and said plot are great. My favorite characters are Mike, Sulley, Celia, and Boo. The humor is hilarious, the title sequence looks neat, Billy and John are great together, Boo is cute, the plot twist where Waternoose was the one behind Randall's schemes was really surprising, and the music by Randy Newman was excellent!There are some emotional scenes, like when Sulley scares Boo, and when they have to part ways. I know Randall is a funny villain and all, but he is a jerk in my opinion. Anyway, the song ""If I Didn't Have You"" was amazing, and there's more to laughs than scariness, which makes this a really fun movie.

336,jpellino,"Stunning, touching, funny.",10,4 November 2001,"Pixar have outdone themselves once again.  Everyone else is an also-ran.  I saw ""Shrek"" for the first time this afternoon on video.  Then I went and bought a ticket to ""Monsters Inc."".  First, this is the second in a disturbing series of coincidences where Pacific Data Images / Dreamworks SKG is first to market with a similar theme to Whatever-Pixar-Has-Announced.  It happened with Antz / Bug's Life and now it seems with Shrek / Monsters.  While not plagiarism, it is nonetheless eyebrow-raising that the same theme (hero bugs and misunderstood monsters) ends up in both studios.  PDI/SKG's screens are crowded and rich, but can't hold a candle to Pixar animation - and their storytelling falls far short as well.  Originality?  To take a William Steig book and then completely remove any trace of the author's celebrated illustration style is disturbing.  And as for the characters, they all seem, like the ants in Antz, to be made of the same basic animation model, stretched and colored to turn them into the needed creature.  It's the cheap way out, and it shows. Pixar's animation techniques are visually stunning - see this in a theatre - don't wait for video/DVD - the fur on Sully alone is worth the price of admission.  Shrek had its moments - but that was the point - moments - but not a film that hangs together - gags, funny voices (you listen to ""Donkey"" it's because it's funny to hear Eddie Murphy in a home-boy dialect as a donkey, not because of the riveting dialogue).  The acid test?  I'm, far too old to be moved by a kid's movie - and I was, as with even some of Pixar's shorts - near tears near the end.  I wouldn't rent Shrek again - there's really nothing to go back to look at - but as usual, I'll likely go pay to see Monsters again... how can a character with one eye emote  more than most with two?  Bravo Pixar!  Memo to PDI/SKG - you don't go down in history for cutting corners & me-too.  Try again.","Monsters, Inc."

The baby Boo is really cute and playful, and those with babies will totally relate to all the things she does. The plan of evil Randall, and what happens in the end was just funny!

Steve Buscemi is a great villain and James Coburn has a great voice that fits his character perfectly. John Ratzenberger as always is very entertaining this time in a role as banished Yeti.The story itself is pretty simple but thats what makes it easy to follow and so much fun to watch. The movie not only knows how to entertaining but also knows how and when to emote. The combination of fun and emotional things is perfectly balanced and placed within the movie.There is some great dialog but the true power of ""Monsters, Inc."" are the wonderful characters. Not is there only a wild variety of strange and weird characters but also some characters that are good for some serious laughs and Boo is simply adorable and a pretty fair representation of a kid in real life.

345,thetimegivenus,Who Would Have Dreamed Monsters Could Be So Much Fun!,6,31 January 2011,"Who would have thought that a film about monsters could be so much fun? While this certainly isn't Pixar's most intellectually stimulating film, it is an enjoyable way to spend an evening as a family... unless, of course, your children are afraid of monsters.The Story: Mike and Sulley are workers at Monsters, Inc., the huge power plant that keeps the city of Monstropolis running smoothly. Their job: to collect the screams of little children. Screams are what power Monstropolis, so every night the monsters must enter the world of humans in order to scare the children as they fall asleep.But the children are not the only ones being scared. The monsters believe that children are poisonous and that just one touch from a human child will kill them. So when a two year-old girl follows Sulley back through her closet door into Monstropolis, the monsters' world is turned upside down.The Good: As with many Pixar films, friendship and looking out for others is a major part of this story. The relationship that grows between Sulley and Boo is very sweet and he goes to great lengths to keep her safe. This is a wonderful example of what we should be willing to do to protect widows, orphans, and all those weaker than ourselves. Also noticeable was the contrast between good and evil and the lesson that laughter and joy are more powerful than fear.The Bad: This film is very clean. Besides a few monster kisses and one use of the word darn, there's really nothing offensive here. One thing parents of young children may want to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the film is about monsters who come out at night and scare little children. While this is resolved nicely in the end, some young children may find a film about monsters to be more scary than funny.Conclusion: While Monsters, Inc. may not be a very deep film, it is an extremely entertaining one! If you're looking for a delightful way to spend an evening, and you are not afraid of monsters, Monsters, Inc. may just fit the bill.","Monsters, Inc."
346,lupanminefujiko,monsters are gentleman,8,26 July 2016,"***spoiler**** All of children don't like monsters because they are so agree, dirty and they eat them, but indeed the monsters also don't like human. In this film, you can see and understand the thought and the habit of the monster. First, they think that human have risky sick so if they touch us they have to clean themselves; they washes themselves and cut their fair. Secondly, they use our fear as the energy; they surprise us to gather our fear. But they are kind if we are accepted as a friends and they protect us, even though they are in danger; SULLY he is a big blue monster protects a child she is a lead character, despite he is in danger of losing his working. In this film, you are always stick to BOO, leading character, because she is so cute and so pretty. When the BOO parts from the monsters, you can't see the scene without crying. And you don't have to the partnership of SALLY and MMIKE. They solve the problems together with covering their weak point. If you like this film, you should see the part 2, in which you can see how to meet the lead character's monsters.","Monsters, Inc."
347,Chessack,An adorable addition to the Pixar repertoire,8,3 November 2001,"Monsters Inc. follows in the footsteps of its predecessors in being an extremely charming movie that is fun for the whole family. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to both children and adults. Pixar has had many great hits in the past, the most shining examples being the Toy Story movies. Monsters Inc. is clearly designed to be similar to those movies, and to appeal to the same crowd that they did -- and for the most part, it succeeds.The performances (vocal) by Billy Crystal and John Goodman are excellent, as one would expect. There are a few other recognizable voices that make cameos as well (can you figure out who plays the Abominable Snow man? It took me a few minutes). The animation is, of course, first rate (if you get a chance, perhaps on a second viewing, which this movie is worth, pay attention to the way Mike's one eye shows so much expression, and to how the fur movies on Sully with the breeze).This movie isn't quite as good as Toy Story, though. Where it lags behind its predecessors is that the story is a bit, well... obvious, once you get the feel for it, and it is slightly slow in the beginning. The ending is exciting, however, and that makes up for the slow start. The one real disappointment (if you can call it that, since it is minor) is that the movie doesn't have very many interesting supporting characters. Boo, Sully, and Mike are the main stars, but other than one or two slimy villain-types, there really aren't many other interesting characters in the movie. And that's a shame, since the monster world certainly could have given us plenty of nifty personalities.That said, Monsters Inc. was fun, and gives the viewer much to laugh at, and maybe even a thing or two to sniffle at along the way. Boo, the little human girl, was absolutely precious -- I wanted to take her home with me. I recommend this one to children of all ages -- especially those of us over the hill.My score: 8/10","Monsters, Inc."
348,xgros,"Fun for all, from 7 to 77",9,2 February 2002,"Finally, an entertaining, non-violent, funny movie (computer animation) hits the screen. This movie can be watched from 7 to 77 with no fear of monsters. Pixar did - again - an excellent job in terms of computer animation and story telling for the whole family. In addition there is a short hilarious animated cartoon before the main feature.The story is original with funny bits and pieces everywhere up to the last line of the credentials: ""No monsters was hurt during the filming"". Monster Inc is a bowl of fresh air in the jungle of war/violent/horror movies that have been recently released.Colourful and without a second wasted Monsters Inc. is a must to watch.

349,the_cave_troll,an entertaining film for children of all ages,8,21 September 2002,"Monsters, Inc. is the type of film Disney used to make.  Sure the computer animation is new, but the old Disney formula is the same here.  Great animation, lovable characters, a simple plot, and slapstick humor are what made Disney films like 101 Dalmations, Dumbo, Pinnochio, etc. all great childrens films.  Monsters, Inc, however has done what these films could not do by extending its audience beyond your standard 3-11 year old. 
The creators of Monsters, Inc. have paid enormous attention to detail in their work such that jokes like an ooze-generating monster mopping a floor, or an abominable snowman serving yellow snow cones (No, its lemon!) will entertain adults who normally don't find animation very interesting.It is fortunate that Disney (Pixar in this case) has chosen to veer away from the formula that made its animated cartoons go ""over the top"" in the past.  Yes, I mean the singing!  The music chosen for this film goes over well and does not steal the show from the principal actors (Billy Crystal and John Goodman) and features a duet from the two at the closing credits (Oscar nominated song ""If I didn't have you"".Crystal works well as the scare ""coach"" Mike Grebalski (spelling?).  Disney could have chosen ""over the top comedian Robin Williams for this part but wisely chose Billy Crystal whose comedy was light hearted and fun.  Goodman gave a stellar performance as scare legend ""Sully"", the scarer who falls in love with a little child.  While there were some plot holes (how did Mike get back from the snow world?), I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone, especially to those with children. Buy Rating (0 = burn all copies of this  1 = good for USA network on Saturday night  2 = wait to come out on cable, network TV  3 = worth a rent 4 = buy it cheap on VHS  5 = buy it on DVD5 of 5 stars","Monsters, Inc."

Not only is it my favorite animated film of all time, but now its one of my favoite 3D MOVIE ever. In my opinion the jokes are screamingly (no pun intended) funny, and the dialog is one of my favorite ever. I love every single character (Mike is my favorite), and all the voice acting is superb. The animation is fantastic and the cool twist on ""the monster in the closet"" is fun and very clever. One of my favorite scenes is when Mike and his girlfriend Celia are on a date at Harryhausens (a restaurant in Monstropolis) and Sully comes in with Boo and unintentionally crashes their date and Boo gets loose, it's hilarious havoc, and I love every minute, and of course every other scene in Monster's Inc. Like I said before, I love this movie, it's hilarious, creative, original, featuring awesome characters, this is a great film that everyone can enjoy.

354,asticht-2,Brilliant and unexpected,8,9 August 2005,"Monsters Inc. is without a doubt a well conceived movie. The writing was very good and the storyline, contrary to what one professional reviewer from CNN.com said, does NOT drag in the middle. If anyone has seen the early trailer of this movie, it doesn't give justice at all to the movie. John Goodmans portrayal of the big blue monster Sully is warm, and touching. His interaction with the little girl he names Boo is absolutely delightful. There are actually several scenes where some really heartwarming and tear-jerking things happen. This is very surprising considering Disney hasn't really released a tear-jerker since the Lion King in 1994. Unfortunately Billy Crystals character named Mike while very much in character for him is not nearly as visible in the picture as many movie goers would like. Although he is a main character, his humor is very subdued and he is not as sarcastically funny as he is capable of. Even though John Ratzenbergers (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) role is a small one, his character Yeti is very comical and provides a few moments of comic relief during a particularly tense section of the movie.The animation however is far more brilliant than Disney/Pixar's previous CGI releases Toy Story, A Bugs Life, and Toy Story II. The environments created for the characters is very cartoon-like in many respects, unlike the phenomenal realistic worlds created in this Summers hit Shrek. The animation is not as complex as Shrek was, but it is very obvious just looking at Sullys heavy fur coat to see the advances computer animation has taken since Jurassic Park rewrote the book on computer effects in 1993. All in all this movie is more geared to kids in the content of the dialog. Parents will find the movie enjoyable, but don't expect as much sarcastic wit and sexual innuendos as Shrek contained as this is a Disney movie after all. I recommend seeing this movie, you'll get a real kick out of the animated short film Pixar created for this release that precedes the movie called ""For the Birds"". It didn't hurt to have Lucasfilm release it's first trailer for Star Wars Episode II with this movie either.","Monsters, Inc."

What else would you expect from Pixar? Beautiful color scheme, great imagination, spot-on characterization.  ""Sully""'s hair is, in a word, incredible, as are many of the minute details Pixar pays attention to.  In my opinion, Pixar again sets the standard for a living, breathing, stylized 3D animated world.Plot- Good..... Paced well and wildly imaginative.With all the above accolades, you would think I rated this movie a 10, like I did Toy Story 2.  I love individual components of this film.  But I couldn't bring myself to.  Something's missing.  When I go to see a movie in this genre, I want to be transported back 20 years (I'm currently 29) and walk out of the theater with a stupid grin on my face. The somewhat complex plot (for this kind of film) and some scenes only an adult would get the subtext to keep me from rating it higher.  Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie, but I just didn't have the stupid grin on my face after seeing it.  Kids will love it for the characters, action, and color, but I just can't see a kid under 10 being fully engaged in what's going on.  Too simplistic for adults, too complex for younger kids, it's heart is pulled in different directions.  Still, I give it an 8/10 because it is a great movie despite my quibbles and it has tremendous production values.  If you're going to see it, do so on the big screen.","Monsters, Inc."

Good animation (for 2001, of course!)This movie is aimed at younger kids, but enjoyable enough to watch as an adult. (In fact, I (23) saw it with two friends, one 26-years-old and pregnant with first kid, and my 27-year-old boyfriend).  Appropriate for all ages.Whole lotta cuteness going on in the movie, but I didn't find it sickening (I tend to find cuteness sickening).I'd give it a 7/10, boyfriend gave it a 6/10, friend would give it a 9/10 or 10/10.  It's definitely worth seeing.The short bird cartoon done by Pixar (""for the Birds"") at the beginning of the movie was GREAT.  The mannerisms of the birds were right on, and made me grin so hard my eyes started to tear (right at the beginning).  Reminded me of watching the  Great 'story' & imagination.

Frankly, it wasn't that funny and moved kind of slow. And of course was totally predictable.

One day, Sulley and Mike surprise many children. Then, they meet a girl. Usually, many children are surprised by monsters, but the girl doesn't surprise at them.

They protect her. Finally they must say good bye to her. Then, they decide to have nothing to do with human being. I think this movie is fun, but In the last, it's sad.

Instead of being a series of gags held together by a loose story line (Shrek), this is a wonderful tale of friendship and the value of open minds with great gags to accentuate the smiles.Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfectly cast as the monsters who are thrust into the task of protecting an innocent child from the CDF (Child Detection Force) after she accidently makes her way into the world of monsters.You'll laugh, you'll smile, and sometimes you'll wish you could hear the movie over the audience's laughter. Enjoy!","Monsters, Inc."
365,bacoby13,A Film With A Heart of Gold,9,6 November 2001,"The first thing I said coming out of Monsters Inc. was ""Shrek? What's Shrek?"" Monster's Inc. is a fantastic effort from Pixar, one the features spectacular animation, great humor, and most importantly, a heart of gold. Rarely do anyfamily films hit such an emotional note as beautiful as Monsters Inc.'s final line. Even after leaving, just simply thinking about it gave me a familiar lump in my throat and watery eyes. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect. Enoughsaid. The best character in the entire movie is that of Boo, the child. She steals every scene she's in, even topping the two leads. Her big eyes and sweet voice just melts my heart. This movie, in my opinion, is superior to Shrek, in many ways. While Shrek was initially funny, the jokes got old. One thing I know about Monsters Inc. is that many jokes flew by so quickly, that a second viewing is essential to get it all in. After viewing Shrek for the second time, I realize that the jokes were only funny once. Honestly, go see Monsters Inc., with kids in tow or not. This one is a charmer for all ages and a healthy break from the usual summer and fall fare. 10/10","Monsters, Inc."
366,NightoftheDawnoftheDayoftheDead,Mindless trash for the no attention span masses.,1,22 December 2002,"Did anyone actually watch this?  The basic pattern of this movie is roughly 45 seconds of dialogue, and then a LOT of screaming and loud sound effects.The perfect movie for those of us without any sort of attention span. Laugh at the wacky monsters screaming and hitting things and getting bonked on the head.  Don't worry, it's going to happen again soon, so be patient during those three seconds of the characters talking, your mindless garbage is going to repeat itself real soon.This movie has some neat graphics, big deal.  Graphics mean nothing without anything to back them up.Skip this and give your child a copy of The Hobbit (the BOOK, yes, those things with words printed on paper) instead.  It's a good story that isn't dumbed down so much.  Give your kids something that's worth their time, not this flashy and loud tripe with no real substance.","Monsters, Inc."
367,duncansam1996,Good funny film! :D,9,4 December 2012,"I love this film! Funny, nice story, sweet and it is overall a clever film! it works and it has all the characters fit their character type! you see Randal as the slimy monster thats evil and Sully as a big cuddly blue monster that has more heart than Scare! This film stands out as a funny animated short film that people of all ages can smile about. Take for instance Mike Wasouski for instance...he gets the worst things happen to him and yet he still manages to smile and make more people laugh about his funny comments! A very good film but there are problems like in any film. some of these are certain flaws and graphic impossibilities. one of which is when the door handles are one side in one picture and in another picture the door handle is the opposite side...:( hmmm good luck with that. But if you want a funny and family film this is one i would recommend. Id would give this a 10 but i feel it doesn't quite deserve a ten so if i could id give it a 9.5. Hope this helps and thanks for reading! Happy reviewing! :D","Monsters, Inc."
368,transmitter,Close to Perfect,9,5 March 2005,"While many of the 18-34 demographic may scoff at animations, Pixar has defined itself as the Disney for this generation. John Lassetter, from the early days of moving lamps, is a genius at telling compelling stories that reasonant with people of any age. Monster Inc. is a not-so-typical buddy story (think Maverick and Goose) with the evil antagonist trying to rule the world (think any 007 movie).The facial expressions (if you can use that phrase with these creatures) and their interactions amongst themselves (jealousy) and coworkers (passive aggression) create a richness in character that is humanizing.The film is filled with The Simpsons style of humor: Level 1 (visual gags); Level 2 (puns, the ho-hum jokes for adults); and Level 3 (the entire scene/movie is a joke/parody).The film and score are an impressive feat for both adults and kids to enjoy (together).","Monsters, Inc."
369,Victorious_One,"A Cute, Enjoyable Film",9,29 October 2005,"""Monsters, Inc"" is a lovely family film to watch. The story is basically about a Monster City, in which its power is generated by scaring children. But what's funny about this is that the people of this city, or I should say, the monsters of this city are more afraid of the children than the children are afraid of them. But when a young girl accidentally enters Monster City, the top scarer, Sullivan and his friend Mike start sharing a bond with this girl, or what Sullivan called her, Boo, after realizing that she is no harm to them.The story is somewhat weird, yet hilarious, and is full of laughs. ""Monsters, Inc"" is a very enjoyable film and is worth watching and owning.","Monsters, Inc."

The monsters in this town work at a factory that can put them in any child's closet world wide. Screams power the city and are collected via these portals. But strangely enough, any contact with a child also scares the monsters, let alone the thought that one should come back thru the door into their city. The pressure is on Sulley and his one-eyed partner, Mike, to keep their number one ranking at work. Randall will to anything to get that number one spot, even... Although this movie is not meant for real young children, all will enjoy the story. The animation is top rate, so well done you can see his the texture of his fur and the scales on his skin. I can only hope PIXAR will top this with their next animated feature...","Monsters, Inc."

373,yayagirl14,Totally Genius,10,26 December 2006,"Monsters Inc. is just what I expected, Amazing. Every time I see a Pixar movie, from the spectacular Finding Nemo, or the hilarious Toy Story, I know I will be enjoyed. Pixar has such a way with making movies interesting to all ages. Because everyone of all ages, can relate to these characters, or the plot. From all the special features and commentaries I watch on these movies, the directors and writers really do spend so much time in making sure all audiences can watch their movies.Now that I have talked about Pixar, I will talk about Monsters Inc. The movie is just wonderful. From the first scene, where the monster is just totally destroying this kid's room, to the last scene, where Sulley finally sees Boo again, I laugh, I worry, I feel. If anyone says there is nothing funny in this movie, they must either have no sense of humor, or a really bad sense of humor, or just want to be cynical. The movie is HILARIOUS, with lines such as ""did you loose weight, or a limb"" The voices are wonderful, John Goodman just has this wonderful voice for animated films, it is so deep and hard, but tender and soft. Billy Crystal is just wonderfully funny. Even all the little characters, like the abominable snow man, are just hilarious. And the story is also touching, you really feel for Boo, and her relationship with Sulley, and even with Mike.I think the thing that makes Pixar so different from all other animation companies such as Dreamworks, Pixar doesn't very many vocal songs. They have an orchestra do most of their music. It gives the movies much more of a genuine tone. Even though i love the sound track to Shrek and Shrek 2, I feel i watch the movie for the music, not the plot. Pixar has such amazing music, you don't realize that it almost another character to the films.Overall, Monsters Inc. is a wonderfully entertaining film and should be watched by any age group.","Monsters, Inc."

The actually idea of the movie is ingenious... its so imaginative and creative. and it was so good.. i really dont think there could be any bad things to say about it, and no matter what age you are i definately recommend to see it..","Monsters, Inc."
375,transylvanianfairy,Another gem from Pixar,10,6 July 2013,"Man, I love Pixar. Time goes by and their movies have never disappointed me. Monsters, Inc was obviously not an exception. I really can't think of any flaw in this movie. The animation was beautiful. The voices were perfect, with a special mention to Billy Crystal, who gives voice to the funniest character in the whole story (in my opinion), Mike Wazowski. There are good guys and, of course, villains. The monsters are, in fact, no monsters at all; they are incredibly sweet and human. And of course, the script; funny, witty and surprisingly deep. At this point, I guess everybody knows that Disney films always (and I mean always) have an important message, for both kids and adults. Monsters, Inc is a tale about friendship, sticking together through the hard times and not being afraid of the unknown. 90 minutes of cinematic joy that I'd recommend everyone. Grab the popcorn and enjoy.","Monsters, Inc."
376,zonagirl5,"Most original storyline to hit the market and funny, too!!!",10,6 November 2004,"This movie's plot and subplots are filled with morals, humor and sheer wit. Add to the fact that this is an animation, makes this movie one of the best, ever!Monsters are something children concoct in order to justify/understand their feelings of fear and thus, monsters are bad. However, the Monsters in this movie are just as afraid of children and believe them to be bad.The movie points out how modern society motivates us with fear and how the fear of others is used to fuel our own lives.The friendship between Scully and Boo reveals that when we address or get to know our fear, our fears can dissolve into something good like friendship.I really enjoyed how the movie turned negativity into positivity. This movie is guaranteed to make you laugh.","Monsters, Inc."

Billy Crystal had some very funny lines, John Goodman was a little to sappy for my tastes but if you can take it in stride over all this is a good film.I might not have been to crazy about the acting but let me tell you about the animation: this films is one of Pixars best films as far an animation goes!Film plot:(doesn't give too much away.) Monsters, Inc. is a power company for monsters. Monsters use screams for power the only way to get screams is to scare kids. There is nothing more dangerous than touching a child!! but what happens if one comes into the monster world?!?!over all i would give this film 7 out of ten.","Monsters, Inc."
378,sQuint,The brightest minds in show business,10,13 November 2001,"People can ""Shrek"" about it all they want. Here's the real deal: ""Shrek""-style cynicism and sarcasm are easy. The ability to look at the world with a childlike sense of wonder and creativity is a gift. It's a gift the Pixar guys and gals are copiously endowed with. There are more clever, witty ideas in any given five minutes of any Pixar flick than there are in the entire running time of 99% of the crass Hollywood rubbish being foisted on the movie populace. It's a small miracle that these folks are able to do what they do, to say nothing of the technical advances they achieve. To those who say there's no difference between the flicks, please, watch ""Toy Story"" and its sequel. The advances in fabric motion, just to name one small aspect, are amazing, and take another step in ""Monsters.""It's the attention to detail that makes the Pixar movies so great -- detail in the nuances of how a character behaves or what his life is ""really"" like, detail in the background of scenes, even in small supporting characters. These films are a long time in the making and it's time well-spent. What a treat to be able to sit in a theater with people of all ages and backgrounds, laughing and having a great time. There are few movies for children that adults can abide, much less enjoy. Most of them are insults to the intelligence of the average two-year-old, much less Mom & Dad. This movie, full of life, good cheer, and sincerity, makes the likes of ""Pokemon"" seem even more like the drab, lifeless and uninspired toy commercials they are.","Monsters, Inc."

There are hundreds of great little things in this movie. I particularly enjoyed that the Monsters company had taken recognizable characteristics of ""normal"" companies and mixed them with freaky monsters. Original ideas like contaminated socks never seemed fetched from too far. And apparently for translation into German not much of the original humor got lost. ""We scare because we care"" was also a funny rhyme - even in German. 10/10","Monsters, Inc."

384,oldiesmann,Excellent!,10,18 November 2002,"Disney and Pixar have done it again. It seems that every time these two companies pair up to make a film, it's a blockbuster, and this is no exception. A wonderfully animated film with a highly creative storyline. This movie gives us a glimpse into the monster world in a way that nobody else could accomplish. The animators have given each monster its own personality, and the detail is amazing. How else do you describe the way the writers came up with all the details of the Monsters, Inc. company? This movie is so wonderful because it's not trying to scare kids like so many other monster movies. Although there are a couple of scary moments, this movie is gentle enough for even the youngest children to watch. This movie is by far the best one that the Pixar team has created. The wonderful sound effects, graphics and fun storyline, combined with the cleverly disguised jokes make this a film for the entire family. I saw it twice in the theaters and once at a ""free-movie-in-a-local-park"" type setting, and now I have the DVD. This movie is excellent.","Monsters, Inc."
385,dhein09,"A Truly Fanstastic Film, To Be Enjoyed By All",10,10 May 2008,"When I first heard about this film somewhere in 2001, I thought that, after the failure from Toy Story 2, Pixar wouldn't redeem themselves. But in early 2002, when I saw this in theaters, I was shocked! The movie was fantastic! I laughed at everything to be laughed at, and the beautiful animation and wonderful voice cast just made it better.The Plot: (may contain spoilers) The movie starts out with an introductory to all the main characters and scenes. Mike Wasoski(Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan(John Goodman) are getting the day started when the new TV commercial for Monsters Inc. premiers. Mike is so anxious to see himself on TV, but when he's on the screen, the Monster's Inc. logo covers most of his body. Mike doesn't realize this however and starts shouting with joy.After the morning is started, Mike and Sully head off to work. Mike wants to drive his new car, but Sully says that there's a scream shortage(screams are used to power the city) and that they must walk. Along the way, they encounter some friends and neighbors.When they arrive, Mike walks up to the counter to see Celia(Jennifer Tilly), who he refers to as ""Googly Bear"". It's her birthday and Mike has reservations from a restaurant known for its almost impossibility to get a reservation. After that, he and Sully walk to the locker room to get ready.Mike leaves the locker room early to get his flies from Roz, the secretary who wants it her way and her way only. Mike tries to make it romantic, but fails to put her in a good mood. He still pretends to like her as he walks away, but then snaps out of it soon.Mike and the other scare assistants get the work station ready. They take they're scare card out and slide it in. A door comes by and locks into the station. The door leads to a child's room. It is the scarer's duty to scare the child to produce screams.After setup, the scarers come out. The attendant prepares the monitor and scare records. The assistants prepare the scarer while the attendant prepares the countdown. Then the monsters run into the room and scare the child. Some aren't so lucky, but it turns out to be a good day.But then a scarer, George Sanderson, comes out with a sock on his back. This is considered toxic(the code is 23-19) and the CDA(Child Detection Agency) charges in. A child or anything owned or touched by the child is considered dangerous to monsters. George is decontaminated and has all his fur shaved off.The scare floor is shut down for 30 minutes. The day then goes on as usual. Henry J. Waternoose(James Coburn) asks Sully to come by and give some trainee scares a demonstration. Sully agrees, and eventually the quitting bell rings.Mike and Sully walk into Roz again. Mike says he has a fun-filled evening planned, but after Roz reminds him about paperwork e was supposed to file, he immediately panics. Sully says he'll get the paperwork just as Celia arrives to get Mike. Mike tells Sully what to do and leaves with his date.Sully goes back to the scare floor to get the report. he notices a door was left behind, which is considered carelessness, because all doors must be return by the end of the day. Sully explores the door to see if anyone is left behind. Then he notices a child is play with his tail. He screams in terror and runs off.I'd like to say more, but because of the character limit, I should leave it to you to find out what happens next.The Voices: This movies features a variety of great voice talent. It stars talent like John Goodman(TV's Rosanne), Billy Crystal(Deconstructing Harry), Steve Buscemi(King Of New York), and even a cameo by Frank Oz(Star Wars). All of them worked hard and it paid off.The Verdict: This is a wonderful movie and it's a great way to help younger kids understand that monsters aren't always scary. Plus the great humor, brilliant animation, and wonderful voice cast don't even begin to say how great this movie is.10/10","Monsters, Inc."
386,xbabe82517,the most colourful movie I've ever seen!,10,17 January 2003,"As I'm 20 years old I wasn't very enthusiastic when one of my friend's brought Monsters Inc over to watch one night. I've never been into what I once thought were kids movies. I couldn't get into A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (though they were just as well-made) but when I saw Monsters Inc I was amazed. The colours are beautiful and the monsters actually have individual personalities that you can form an opinion about. My personal favourite is Sully - the way the bond grows between him and Boo is wonderful to watch, and he's such a tender, caring character. It's the only animated movie that has ever truly moved me - the ending brought a tear to my eye. I cannot find any fault with this movie and I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. I'm now the proud owner of the DVD and it's definitely one of my favourite movies ever. Anyone who hasn't seen it should - it's brilliant.","Monsters, Inc."

388,ManyGentleCuttlefish,My personal favorite Pixar movie,10,6 July 2006,"Pixar. With only seven movies you've built yourself a reputation as the greatest current animation studio of them all. Dreamworks has made some good ones and 20th Century Fox's movies have made me chuckle a bit, and Disney has gone downhill in recent years. But you can consistently produce quality work with almost no stain on your track record (except A Bug's Life, the one Pixar movie I did not enjoy). But I've lost track of my thoughts.I'm here to talk about Monster's Inc., my personal favorite Pixar movie.I'm a doodler myself, and wan't to be an animator someday. And I love drawing monsters. Weird looking, many armed, strange-eyed creatures. That may have been the 1st reason Monster's Inc. appealed to me. So many of these creatures looked like something I would draw, and I spent much of my movie time looking at the creatures in the background.I also was captivated by the world that was created in Inc. A big problem for me in Pixar's newest movie Cars was lack of real explanation for their universe, like how they built their buildings. In Monster's Inc. the monster world is explained so much more in depth, and we really believe this world could exist. There's a beauty in watching the thousands of closet doors zoom around and I always get goosebumps from watching the ""scare montage"", because I now know the mechanics of the world these creatures live in. The characters in the world are also incredibly well realized. Mike and Sully both are easily relatable to, and even small characters have feelings and motivations we can understand. ""Boo"" actually behaves like a young child would, and that helped me believe she had real emotions. But the creature Randall is what stole the show for me. With his many arms, chameleon-like ability and sheer voice presence, it was hard for me to keep my eyes off of him. But what really made me love this movie so was the characters. When it comes time for the ""sad part"" of this movie, I was sad. I was actually seeing an animated cartoon that managed to make me feel for these animated creatures without being emotionally manipulative. And I'm not afraid to admit that I cry 4 out of 5 times at the ending.So, in the end, I can't recommend this film enough. I think this stands above all other Pixar productions and is definitely one of the best animated films I've had the pleasure of seeing.","Monsters, Inc."

393,lynxspyder,Another animated film in the tradition of Toy Story that gets it right.,10,5 November 2001,"Monsters, Inc. is a delightful film about two employees, Sully and Mike, who work for the Monstropolis' power plant after which the film is titled. While the film isn't as knee-slappingly funny as others in genre (for example, I didn't think it showed as much humor as Toy Story), it is certainly full of elements that will please adults and children alike. Younger children will likely not quite understand the business of Monsters, Inc. and the nature of the jobs the monsters do. My 4-year-old, for example, didn't quite grasp the whole concept of what the company Monsters, Inc. was all about. She still enjoyed the animated characters and the slapstick humor, however.One of the things that sets Monsters, Inc. apart from other such films is that its plot is a bit more involved than most. The twist at the end involving the company conspiracy (yes, the plot is that involved) is surprising even to adult viewers and part of the reason that adults will really like the film.What really makes the film work, however, is not the plot and the humor, but the main characters themselves. You can't help but like Sully and thus have a vested interest in the events that affect him. John Goodman is the perfect voice for the giant, furry monster who, while being the company's leading scarer, is also the kindest and most selfless character. Billy Crystal is hilarious as Sully's sidekick, and Steve Buscemi appropriately voices the villain Boggs. I also couldn't help but like James Coburn as the company CEO and former mentor to Sully. It's interesting to me how the appearance of the animated Waternoose actually suggests Coburn without looking a thing like him (Waternoose, after all, is a multi-eyed, multi-legged, crablike creature). And Boo? What can you say about Boo? She does all of the things that one expects a tiny child to do, and it's no wonder that Sully is unable to resist her charms. You find yourself laughing at Boo just being a little girl.Monsters, Inc. is the best films I've seen all year. It's one of the few films that I could sit back and just plain enjoy.","Monsters, Inc."
394,ahill-1,Now here's a story children and adults can relate too. Monsters in the closet.,10,12 December 2001,"While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work.  The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power.  It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures.  One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team.  Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's.  It's wondrous and funny.  In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee.  He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children.  He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye.  His comedy is seen through out the movie.  Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent.  Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he's on top.Mike's girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike's best interest at heart.  Her job is to keep him out of trouble.I give Monsters, Inc. a ten.  It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It makes for great family fun.","Monsters, Inc."
395,Platymania,"Not Pixar's finest, but a good film nonetheless",8,22 December 2003,"Monsters Inc. carries on Pixar's tradition of fun, silly and extremely well-made productions. The animation and rendering is superb, and the voice-talent brings it all home wonderfully. Perhaps my only serious disappointment has to be the over-abundance of sentimentality, but this is what happens when you introduce little children into the plot. I did thoroughly enjoy it, but it failed to have the lasting impact on me that A Bug's Life and the Toy Stories had.","Monsters, Inc."
396,dprb23,Must See Animated Movie...,9,11 December 2002,"I believe that this movie ranks as possibly the best animated movie I have seen. The Toy Story movies and Shrek were great, but Monsters Inc. was better. Why?The animation was phenomenal, the story was unique and made for all ages, and valuable lessons can be learned. Adults can take away more from the movie than kids probably can. In a very creative way, the movie promoted laughter, not being greedy, love, etc. It was wonderful.If your a Disney fan or not, it's a well spent 90 minutes.","Monsters, Inc."
397,freddyjoyce,Amazing,9,25 September 2008,This is a fantastic movie. At first you may think that it's for kids but you are very wrong. I watched this for the first time when I was in my 16-18 year spirt and I laughed non stop. The story is Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into there world. Usually him and all the other monsters who work at monsters inc go through a door that leads them into a childs room once there they scare the kids and the children's screams are put into capsules and brought back and used as energy. So when the girl gets into there world it causes a lot of trouble. This is a great film that you can watch alone or with your entire family.,"Monsters, Inc."
398,donovanwyatt-50274,Monster Inc.,10,8 April 2018,"In the aftermath of my lukewarm review of The Incredibles, someone asked me what I would consider the great PIXAR film. I didn't want to give an immediate response without revisiting all the titles I had loved the first time round, before my critical faculties had developed to their current level. But until such a point in time, Monsters, Inc. is a very good candidate, being a truly great children's film with all the hallmarks of what makes PIXAR great.All the best PIXAR films have a simple but engaging premise, from which an entire world can be constructed. With Toy Story 1 & 2, it was that your toys are alive and will miss you when you're not there. What could just be a gimmick was expanded out into a fascinating, complex and heart-warming story about childhood, jealousy, rejection and the fear of being abandoned. PIXAR have always been very good storytellers, laying the proper foundations of a world in which memorable characters can flourish.With Monsters, Inc., the premise is equally straightforward: there are monsters in your wardrobe (closet if you will), but they are more afraid of you than you are of them, and they rely on you to function. From this idea is built up the entire system of the factory for harnessing children's screams, the means by which monsters can travel to our world, the hierarchies within the workplace, and the central comic conceit of a child who escapes into the monster world and isn't afraid of Sully or Mike.Even in this set-up, Monsters, Inc. presents itself as a really great twist on monster stories, giving insight into the nature and purpose of monsters in our childhood and culture. It's a film about children learning to grow up and face their fears: either the monsters simply cease to be scary (as happens early on, when a door is shredded), or the children end up actively laughing at them, which the monsters eventually embrace. The discovery later in the film that laughter is more powerful than scares reinforces this message about standing up to your fears and overcoming them. It also ties in with one of PIXAR's overarching themes, namely coming to terms with the people we love growing up.There is also a neat little role reversal in the film regarding the choice of monsters. The employees at Monsters, Inc. are assigned to a specific child to extract the most possible scares out of a given subject. Rather than the children creating the monsters, as manifestations of their fears and uncertainties, the monsters are tailored for them in the hope that their fears might manifest themselves. This approach within the fictional universe is complimentary with PIXAR's notions of creativity: their films have broad appeal but they are built around emotions and feelings that children will respond to, rather than asking them to respond to something they know nothing about.On an entirely different level, Monsters, Inc. is also a film about good business practices. The prosperity of the company is directly in proportion to the quality of life enjoyed by its employees. At the start of the film, everyone is working flat out to avert an energy crisis and the management keep complaining when anyone falls short. They even resort to underhand tactics to achieve their goal, rather than thinking the problem through with their employees at the heart. In contrast, Sully's management decisions, from the new energy source to the brighter colours in the workplace, make dealing with the daily grind a lot more fun.There are a lot of wonderful touches to the visual world of Monsters, Inc. which reinforce the business angle to it. Mike and Sully's world has a lot of blue-collar qualities, from the helmets to the metal lunchboxes, but unlike The Incredibles, it doesn't feel like these adult characteristics are being forced upon a younger audience. The paperwork conversations are structured much better and take up less time than the insurance conversations in Brad Bird's film: not only are they shorter but they are not an integral part of the story. We get a sense of how Monsters, Inc. works as a company without Pete Docter having to labour over details at the expense of his characters.While Docter needn't labour in his storytelling, there are a number of nice references to monster movies buried in Monsters, Inc., reinforcing our impression of PIXAR as a thorough team who are passionate and well-researched. The restaurant at which Mike and Celia eat is called Harryhausen's, after Ray Harryhausen, the great stop-motion animator and special effects pioneer. Celia's hair is reminiscent of the Gorgons in the Greek Myths, in which Harryhausen dabbled at the peak of his career. There are also several little nods to other PIXAR works in Sully's last scene with Boo: she hands him a Jesse doll from Toy Story 2, the ball from the PIXAR logo and a clown fish (Finding Nemo was in production at this time).Even if you don't pick up on all the film's deeper themes or references to other works, Monsters, Inc. is still a great piece of storytelling and a really funny family comedy. While Mike and Sully haven't become quite as indelible as Woody and Buzz, they still make a great double act with believable characterisations and great physicality. John Goodman's lugubrious delivery is beautifully balanced out by Billy Crystal's fast-paced dialogue, and unlike many Dreamworks productions it feels like the famous faces are playing characters rather than just letting loose with their own distinctive shtick.Alongside the main pairing, there are a number of really good performances in the supporting cast. Jennifer Tilly is very good as Celia, her gravelly voice capturing the harsher side of the character while being suitably smitten with her """"googly bear"""". Steve Buscemi is well-cast as the villainous Randall, with the role playing to the same slippery, scheming quality that he brought to Fargo or Reservoir Dogs. James Coburn, in his final performance, balances the mentor-like role he has to Sully with all the ruthlessness and frustration surrounding his position. Best of all, however, is Mary Gibbs, who is simply adorable as Boo. Gibbs was only two-and-a-half she was cast, and was so restless that the recording staff had to follow her around with a microphone.Most of the humour in Monsters, Inc. is visual, but it's superbly timed and really quite inventive. The scenes involving the CDA are wonderfully over-the-top, parodying any number of scenes in thrillers where a SWAT team must invade a building and remove a threat. Many of the best gags are throwaways, like the jelly-like monster slipping through the grating in the street, or Randall's multiple colour-changes when Boo is bashing him over the head. There's also some good dry humour between Roz and Mike regarding his paperwork, and when Crystal is required to improvise, it's a lot funnier than his stuff in The Princess Bride.While Monsters, Inc. isn't primarily an action film, it does have several good set-pieces which will keep children entertained. The door chase sequence is to some extent a one-upping of the luggage chase at the end of Toy Story 2, but it's still executed in a very neat way with good editing. Similarly the scenes with the Abominable Snowman (voiced by Toy Story alumnus John Ratzenberger) results in a decent slice of action with a solid punchline. Neither of these scenes are particularly ground-breaking, but they do punctuate the slower, sadder moments.Monsters, Inc. is also noteworthy for the visual leaps it made, for CG animation in general and for PIXAR'S aesthetic in particular. The film utilised a new animation programme called Fitz to accurately produce the appearance and movements of Sully's hair, including the correct amounts of shadowing on different parts of his fur. Without these innovations, Docter's subsequent film Up would not have looked half as inviting. Ironically, the title sequence feels like a product of 1960s Disney, being reminiscent of 101 Dalmatians in both its pacing and design.Monsters, Inc. is a great and funny family comedy which still holds up really well after both 12 years and its recent prequel. While its technical innovations can be marvelled at in hindsight, its real achievements lie in its beautifully crafted story, great characters, memorable performances and the nuanced ideas that these raise together. While it's not quite up to the high standard of Toy Story 2 or Finding Nemo, it remains one of PIXAR's finest achievements.","Monsters, Inc."
399,Crane_94,Now this is what a family movie is all about...,9,24 September 2008,"Laughter, humor, a lesson to learn, an evil villain, a good guy, and his faithful sidekick. What more could you ask for in a movie? Oh, and there's even a romance! They have made a great show for family and kids alike, something that mom and dad can enjoy watching, but that the kids will find fun too. It teaches a lesson... good conquers evil, laughter and love and friendship is more powerful than evil, fear, and nastiness. Good friends stick together and help each other, and also that we shouldn't be scared of things simply because they are unknown to us. I think there is a subtle race/ethnicity lesson here too. The monsters are afraid of the humans... they say they are bad, evil, and can bring death and disaster. The monster leaders have made sure that all monsters know not to touch humans, because they are just BAD. But when one human child gets into the heart of a popular and well known monster, and the monster lives and is not hurt in anyway for caring for and touching and being friends with this human, the rest of the monster world learns a valuable lesson in that humans are bad just because they are human, and that a child's laughter is the most powerful force there is! Hummm, I think that's a pretty good lesson to learn right there!","Monsters, Inc."
400,AnnieC,Good. . . but Not Great!,6,4 November 2001,"Pixar can do no wrong, in my opinion.  In MONSTERS, INC., they did no wrong; they just didn't do enough that was right!  I liked the movie, but I didn't love it.  There was just something missing and I'm not sure what it was. Maybe it was the fact that there were no really well-developed supporting characters.  It was ALL Mike and ALL Sully.  And that wasn't enough! Randall was a good villain; he just wasn't villanous enough! Maybe the monsters weren't scarey enough. . . or cuddly enough.  They seemed to be mostly potatoes, slugs or sausages with an unusual number of eyes. And the boss monster was a rip-off from one of the mutant toys in TOY STORY. Maybe there weren't enough in-jokes to keep adults entertained.  Oh, sure, I liked the STALK/DON'T STALK crossing light.  And I saw the TOY STORY doll but I'm not sure whether it was Woody or the cowgirl.  And I caught the Oscar Meyer jingle line.  But I wanted more. Maybe I was waiting for a song and dance number.  Randy Newman wrote the music.  Why can't we have more than a sing-along over the credits? And where were the Pixar out-takes at the end? I'm not sure the kids in the audience liked the movie so much either.  The kid sitting next to me knew who all the monsters were; she shouted their names out to her dad who was sitting down the row.  But I don't recall her laughing.  Or anything. What was there was clever and even tugged at a heartstring.  It's what wasn't there that's bothersome.","Monsters, Inc."
401,rosi2101,Truly Memorable,10,7 February 2002,"I have seen many cute movies before, and many touching ones, but this one holds the absolute crown.  It made me laugh and cry, which doesn't happen often.  I'm 23, and in my opinion no adult needs to be afraid of boredom while taking a kid (or even a date) to see this film.I must admit to having seen only the dubbed version in Germany, and usually that is inferior to the original, so despite the excellence of the film I saw, the original starring the voices of John Goodman and Billy Crystal must be even better, if that is possible. Completely wonderful, one of the top ten movies I have ever seen.","Monsters, Inc."
402,michael-138,"Very good, careful with little ones",7,12 November 2001,"Monsters, Inc. was a very good movie, though not as good as either of the previous 2 Pixar ""Toy Story"" movies.  I also felt the target age of this movie was higher than of any of the previous movies. There are explanations in this film, central to the plot, about things like an energy crisis and how the company, Monsters, Inc., provides the energy, by causing screams and bottling them (?).  There is adult dating, and funny references to things you'd hear around the office (ie. not around the elementary school). There is a complicated system by which the Monsters actually GET to the rooms to scare kids.  Easy concepts for adults, tough for little ones.One other thing that tripped me out a little was that there were also many references and demonstrations of how monsters pop out of closets or out from under beds and scare the bejeezus out of poor little kids. This can be a little traumatic for little ones.  Along these same lines are a few scenes involving a walk down into a dark, very scary looking dungeon-like corridor, and a few of a type of torture machine that slowly wheels up to a captive victim, who is held immobile in a special chair.  Relatively short scenes, but they scared both my 6- and 3-year-olds.  I was not expecting this and it kind of irritated me.On the whole, it was an enjoyable movie.  To be honest, the most enjoyable part for me was the short animated film that preceded the main attraction, a VERY cute and funny short called ""For the Birds.""","Monsters, Inc."
403,cheddar_fixxx,Pixar Have Done It Again,10,26 September 2002,"*A FEW POSSIBLE SPOILERS*I had heard very, very good things about Monsters, Inc. (2001). All of the people that had seen in theatrically had told me it was fantastic, and it was sitting nicely at #119 in the IMDB Top 250 at the time that I wrote this review. Being that it had come from animated geniuses Pixar, I can't say that I expected something as bad as Kazaam (1996). I expected something terrific, but not as terrific as I got.The story revolves around James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). They both live in a city called Monstropolis, and work at a factory named Monsters, Inc., where monsters are given a designated child of which they go into the bedroom of and scare every morning at work, as that is apparently bedtime for children in the human world, and the screams of the child fill yellow tanks that look like the oxygen tanks scuba divers use. The screams are then processed into electricity, which is used to power the whole of Monstropolis, but they cannot make contact with a child or any object from the child's room, as they believe that nothing is as dangerous or deadly as a human child. Sully is the top scarer currently working in the factory, and is at the top of the ladder on scares, and trailing just behind him is a sleazy monster named Randall Boggs (portrayed very well by Steve Buscemi). Randall is determined to get to the top of the ladder ahead of Sully, so one evening after work, when the scarefloor (where the business is conducted) is empty, Randall sneaks his door down to cheat Sully off the top of the ladder, and goes to fetch a trolley of tanks to get the screams. Roz, the dispatch manager (Bob Petersen (III)) is always up Wazowski about his paperwork not being in on time, on the scares he works with Sully, so Sully covers for him so Mike can go out for dinner to a sushi restaurant with his girlfriend Celia (Jennifer Tilly), the receptionist at the factory. Sully goes up to the scarefloor to collect the paperwork, and discovers the door sitting there while the rest have been put away. He goes in and investigates, and accidentally lets the child, which he later names Boo, out of her room. He panics, and throws her back in, or so he thinks. Accidentally collecting some toys, he runs and stuffs them in a locker. He then discovers that Boo is holding onto his back, so he stuffs her into a sports bag. He gets back just as Randall, noticing his child is not in bed, walks puzzled out of her room, and puts back the tanks and the door. Sully rushes to the sushi restaurant to tell Mike, interrupting their dinner, and making Celia, who has rattlesnakes for hair, very unhappy, and so begins a wild adventure to get Boo back to the her room, but run into many obstacles in the way, such as hiding Boo from Randall, who wants to kidnap her and extract her screams, using a scream extractor (go figure), hide her from the boss, keep her at bay thinking she is deadly, and save their jobs, but get attached to her along the way. There are many other little surprises, such as subtle references to the Toy Story films, those of which I will not give away here, as you should see the film for yourself.The film is not, and I cannot stress this enough, just a kid's movie. Most, if not all, adults that view it will also like and accept it's morals, and appreciate it's sense or humour. It is a great movie for the entire family, as Pixar are renowned for.Beau's Rating: *** 1/2 out of ****","Monsters, Inc."

I don't think that could've happened with this movie.  Pixar has done it again.  As with their previous collaborations with Disney (Toy Story 1 & 2 and A Bug's Life), they've got everything going in the right direction: amazing animation, great writing, and wonderful performances from both the voice actors and the CG characters.

The turn of events were unpredictable and have kept my attention on what would be the next unexpected thing. To sum up things, I would conclude that it is a combination of comedy and poignancy. I immensely enjoyed the movie together with my sweetheart and another lady companion.

It takes place in a city called Monstropolis, not far from your closet door.

I have to say that the people at Pixar are very creative and innovative. In this movie they created a world of monsters which is just great to look at. The fur on the big guy Sulley has to be seen to be believed. I still like 'A Bug's Life' more than this movie. Maybe because it was the ultra bright colours in 'A Bug's Life.

421,JasonGOrtiz,The best Pixar effort so far.,10,26 March 2008,"I know. That's a pretty bold statement. Don't get me wrong, ""The Incredibles"" is certainly worthy of mentioning in this post as is ""Toy Story"" & ""Finding Nemo"". Hell, there hasn't been a weak Pixar film yet. ""Cars"" is definitely my least favorite, but was still miles ahead of anything Dreamworks has done.But for me ""Monsters Inc."" is just the complete package. Obviously the animation is stellar. That pretty much goes without saying for this company. But the animation isn't even the greatest strength of this film. Like ""Toy Story"" before it, the characters in this movie possessed depth and personality, as much as any live action film. Whoever didn't fall in love with Boo upon first introduction, is either heartless or a robot. And furthermore the relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is absolutely touching, while the dynamic of Mike and Sully's relationship is complex and anything but uninteresting.And then there's the real accomplishment of ""Monsters Inc."" which is the originality and creativity inherent in every aspect. This film has such a rich imagination that can be found in everything from the Characters to the films sense of humor. And the plot is one of the most original pieces of screen writing I've ever seen. The first thing I thought after seeing this movie for the first time (And I went to catch the Star Wars: Episode II trailer, not expecting too much from the actual movie!) was ""How in the hell did they dream that up?!?"" I always admire when a movie provides a story that you know was given the utmost thought and attention, and this is no exception.Upon further viewings I began seeing it as timeless fairy tale. Like a household bedtime story that's been around for centuries. I was certain it would have at least an 8.0 rating on this site and was a little confused to see otherwise, especially with other Pixar works in the top 250. But alas I know that this is all just my own opinion and not everyone agrees. Is there anyone else that feels so strongly about this movie? Am I crazy? Dellusional? Maybe all of the above.But at the end of the day this truly is a great piece of film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and walk, no run... you know what take your time, but get somewhere that has this movie and watch it. Alright, you know what? Forget about the whole ""take your time"" thing. Go now!","Monsters, Inc."

The world they bring to live on screen delivers a feel admiration and excitement, and a hardcore ground for parallel-world jokes. However, I can't describe into words the type of emotions they capture. They're so real, these fictitious unrealistic characters are real, and what you feel for them is real.

426,Atarian,Excellent from beginning to end.,10,5 November 2001,"This film is simply fantastic.  The animation, storyline, character development, and overall feel of the movie was well done.  Kudos to Pixar for once again using computer graphics as a storytelling tool instead of as a ploy to garner tickets.  The CG is only second banana to a great story. Still, though- the CG was downright breathtaking.  I look forward to what the people at Pixar will do next.","Monsters, Inc."
427,erichvm,Genuine Warmth and Fun,8,5 November 2001,"The folks at Pixar have done it again, showing that they are in touch with both their inner children and real ones.  Monsters, Inc. has all the usual eye-candy; although the Toy Story films as well as A Bug's Life have made it more difficult to marvel at what's becoming an expected level of perfection, one must only consider Sully's fur, which ripples and sways in the wind (and from his own snoring) with complete realism.  The story is typical Disney, but any hokiness is avoided by the genuine warmth of the attachment between Sully and Boo, the human toddler who has accidentally crossed over into the universe of monsters hidden behind the closet door.  Goodman's characterization matches well with Pixar's visualization, creating a lovable lug, and Boo is simply irresistible, notably her baby-talk.  The only real weak link is Billy Crystal's sidekick Mike.  There seems little reason for the character, frankly.  He just gets to be the cranky, manic pal of the hero, the annoying but good-at-heart fast talker.  It's not that Crystal does a bad job, but the character's a little adrift.  The movie also acts as a kind of allegory about our reliance on power sources that are rooted in others' suffering (eg., oil), but one needn't pay THAT much attention!  You REALLY WILL laugh and cry at this one.  And you'll leave feeling better about everything.  Trust me.","Monsters, Inc."

For the first time this year the movie was much better than its trailers (by the way, I thought the Episode Two trailer was definately a let down).  If Disney would just stop making corny after school specials and listen to the filmmaker's behind this comic gem, they would really benefit from it.","Monsters, Inc."

I really don't see why that many people went to see it. It was probably due to the 'blair witch' marketing effect and that they played it in more theaters. Or maybe people are just desperate for a new disney cartoon. Let's face it, 'Shrek' was better.","Monsters, Inc."

If you're the type to find them and love them, there are some cool messages in the plot.  If you're the type to enjoy a movie without thinking too much, it works.

437,jimimadcap,Disney plagiarizes once again!!!,8,25 July 2009,"Don't get me wrong...I loved the movie, but let's give credit where credit is due. The movie was not without controversy. In 2002, famed artist and designer, Stanley ""Mouse"" Miller, sued Disney/Pixar claiming they appropriated and infringed upon a script, story and artwork he'd developed in 1997 that involved two stock ""monster"" characters that he'd developed in the 1960s. Since there were a number of ""incriminating"" issues, including a Pixar story artist visiting Mouse in 2000 (after describing himself as a fan of the artist and discussing Mouse's work with him at length), story and characters plagiarized directly and unchanged from Stanley Mouse's notebooks and script, and new Intellectual Property laws which require clear delineations between ""fair use"" and ""misappropriation"", Pixar was placed at an extreme disadvantage in any ensuing arbitration. Recognizing that they would lose a large portion of their $500 million box-office profits if the case ever went to trial, Disney and Pixar settled out-of-court, with Mr. Mouse winning a large, if undisclosed, sum of money and royalties.","Monsters, Inc."
438,crumpcamra,"Wonderful, would even pay theater prices to see it again!",9,17 November 2001,"Absolutely wonderful film.  Nicely paced so that I did not check my watch at any point.  Fun and exciting enough for my three year old to enjoy it, sassy enough for my six year old, and clever enough for my wife and I.  Easily bypasses the drek that was Shrek, and makes Bug's Life look like something you scrape off your radiator.  Beautiful film.","Monsters, Inc."
439,cofbaron,"Good, but not great.",7,2 November 2001,"That about summed it up for me. The movie's plot moves away from the childish simplicity of the Toy Story movies, and as such there isn't as much room for heart and charm. The plot is more complicated than either Toy Story, so there's not as much room for freedom in having the characters mess around from point A to point B; everything feels a bit rushed.The CG was, as expected, stunning (especially the ""door room"" towards the end... You'll see what I mean.) I got a weird feeling watching this movie, like Pixar was trying to force John Goodman and Billy Crystal to have the same sort of Woody/Buzz chemistry that Tim Allen and Tom Hanks have, but it just falls short somehow.Highlights of the film include the Star Wars: Episode II trailer shown beforehand (which was also good, but not great), the short film ""for the birds"" which also ran before the movie, and some of the more incredible visual effects... But that's it.Matinee(sp) viewing if you must see it now, otherwise I'd recommend renting.","Monsters, Inc."
440,tombrazelton,"Better Than ""Shrek""",10,3 November 2001,"A lot of reviewers have been comparing this movie to this year's earlier digitally animated ""Shrek"". If they're not using that movie as the yard stick, then they're comparing it to previous Pixar efforts ""Toy Story 1 & 2"" and ""A Bug's Life"".Personally, I think ""Monsters, Inc."" is beyond compare and is a strong enough movie to stand on it's own 5 legs.I enjoyed this movie WAY more than ""Shrek"". ""Monsters, Inc."" has characters you care about and it's loaded to the hilt with great jokes for both kids and adults. Although ""Shrek"" was a good film, I walked away from it feeling like it was trying to be all things to all people and it didn't satisfy as thouroughly as this film.""Monsters, Inc."" knows it's audience and respects them with it's clever premise - monsters live in another universe powered by the ""Scream Energy"" they collect from hopping out of kids closets and scaring the bejesus out of them. But in the end, we learn a laugh is more powerful than a scream. Great lesson and very inventive!All of the characters that inhabit Monstropolis come in a great variety of shapes, colors and personalities. You can tell the animators had a lot of fun creating them. The voice over work of Billy Crystal and John Goodman was spot-on. They have excellent chemistry and are a treat to listen to.The action elements of the film are not to be missed. The last 30 minutes are filled with an exciting chase set within jaw-dropping surroundings. The final moment is a wonderful, touching moment that plays magnificently with the special relationship Goodman's big, blue Sully has with the 3 year old girl ""Boo"" who he has taken under her wing.""Monsters, Inc."" is a very effective movie for fans on all levels.","Monsters, Inc."
441,kobeonthelakers,"In a year like this, Monsters Inc is a must see movie.",10,31 October 2001,"Those who follow movies closely like I do know that this year was not a good one for Hollywood. The only reason Hollywood broke tons of box office records is because they charge 10 dollars for each ticket! The only positives out of this year are the quality of the animating movies that are being produced. Monsters Inc. probably isn't as good as Shriek but it definitely is better than Toy Story Two and anyone who is sick and tired of seeing over paid, foul mouthed actors act out totally boring over used plots should see Monsters Inc. You might also want to see this movie to understand that the monsters that hid under your bed as a kid didn't really do it on purpose. I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. Kids and adults will like this movie.","Monsters, Inc."

The story is original(as far as i know) all the characters are cute and unigue, the little girl is a bundle of joy, story development is alright, some funny physical humor..etc. etc....but all in all, it was just the computer animation that makes this movie stand out. everything else was just mediocre.. Billy Crystal still isn't that funny no matter what people say. So if you feel like you HAVE to see it, go when tickets are cheap.","Monsters, Inc."
443,animfan,AWESOME,10,5 November 2001,"The animation, colors, style, shading - in short EVERYTHING about this film makes it the technically best animated feature film I've seen to date. Shrek looks like an animation school's course project in comparison!  The fur on Sully is absolutely stunning.  Anyone in the industry will tell you that the door scene is the most impressive display of complexity yet too!No spoilers - but I also think the story is good.  I think it will appeal more to females simply because most people who have seen it call it 'cute.' I do think however that it will appeal equally to adults and children - AND that there is no need for concern with taking even the youngest children to see this one.10/10","Monsters, Inc."
444,bestlerwilcox,Amazingly wonderful fairytale,10,3 November 2001,"What a perfect film for these times.  Monsters, Inc. helps us remember the generous joys we have with laughter as the best medicine.  Sully's huge furry body makes way to a monster who is loving, caring and warm - there are many surprises in store for him during the story line.  Mike (M.I.K.E. with one ""I"") has cute little quips that has everyone giggling throughout the film.  ""Boo"" brings us GREAT joy - with her giggles, charm, cute little games, and adorable smile.  The ""voiceovers"" are a perfect match for every character.  Pixar's animation brings a whole new world to the medium of creativity and commitment.  You will never look at another closet door the same - I guarantee if you have a child (or maybe even you) - there will be a searching in every closet - to see if we can get to the fun little world of Monstropolis - I wanna see ""kitty""!","Monsters, Inc."

Its not one of those gross out comedies that are plaguing the market today.  It is just.fun.  A good movie that the whole family can enjoy.  The Computer Graphics in this film are jaw dropping, especially on Sulley's fur.  Plus we get to here that distinctive voice of John `Cliff' Ratzenberger as the Yeti in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. An all round great movie with perfect casting and a awesome story line with plenty laughs provided for kids of ages 4 to 78 and higher. The only gripe with this movie is the character of Randall Boggs played by Steve Buscemi, more could have been done with his character, but this is being real picky. Great Laughs.

There is adult humor  (as in intelligent, not  as in gross or obscene) that tickles the adult funny bone as well as entertaining children of all ages.  I was delighted to see that the second viewing was just as fun if not more.  I caught little subtle funnies that I missed the first time and laughed just as much at those I remembered.  The current release includes out-takes with the ""cast""  which are hilarious.  My only caution is that some of the scare scenes could be a little scary for the young ones but they don't last long and seem to be soon forgotten by the gentleness shown by some of the monsters.  I predict it will live long in the video market too!","Monsters, Inc."

A city of monsters with their very own way of generating electricity - through terrifying human children! The classic door scheme, where they walk through and end up in a child's closet; it's like nightmare on elm street with humour and lovable characters! Originally, the monsters are scared of the children because they think they are contaminated, therefore, they have a whole security system ensuring nothing of the human world enters the monster world - the CPA! (child protection agency). However, Mike and Sullivan end up in a spot of bother when they end up with a curious and naive little child - Boo!

The story of Monster's working to be what Monster's are known to us humans to be in a fairytale is quite amusing. It's written perfectly with just the right number of jokes and subtle moments, and the screen time of everyone is timed perfectly. I love every second of ""Monster's Inc.""

459,salihdora,:),9,28 April 2020,"The animated feature from Pixar reveals that it is true (as every child knows) that there are monsters in the bedroom closet, especially after the lights have been put out. What we did not realize is that the monsters are on assignment. A closet door, which by day leads to a closet, at night leads directly to Monstropolis, the world of monsters, which is powered by Scream Heat. The only reason monsters jump out of closets and scare kids is to collect their screams, which are to Monstropolis as power plants are to the rest of us.","Monsters, Inc."
460,wandellaty,Great Movie,8,3 May 2006,"Keeping in line with the other Pixar feels that came before it, Monsters Inc, is an enjoyable film for the ages. I especially liked the script. I felt the writers did a good job keeping the humor clean but giving it enough of an inside joke for older viewers to appreciate. I liked the way they ended the movie too, they left things open for a future movie. I have probably watched this one over 35 times. What about Mike's car, do you think he would get another one. I would have liked to see what kind of car they would have designed for Sully. The old lady #1 was a good role it was very believable. The only part I didn't like all that much was the part when they were chasing around in the assembly line of doors and the crushing etc. That scene went a little long, but overall it was a great movie.","Monsters, Inc."
461,Ben-75,Story counts,8,4 November 2001,"I've seen a number of reviews about this say Toy Story I & II and Shrek were better.  They were in many ways - especially more laugh out loud funnier. However, this story is much better in some ways - it's a tightly told tale that moves well.  In fact it's a wonderfully told story which it has heads and tails over all three of those movies.  Were it not for the gags, and other good laughs in the prior three I'd say Monsters was better.
In terms of the animation - the animation is awesome, quite smooth and very subtle.  For lack of a better word the animation becomes almost non-existant.  You forget it's a computer animated film, and you sit back and sink into the story - and except for a need for better absolute laughs - nothing else dissapoints.","Monsters, Inc."
462,Hitch-7,Eyecatching and brilliant animation will tickle your funnybone!,9,23 November 2001,"This movie is nothing short of Pixar's best to date. The witfull animations put together with some of the best voices in the business. John Goodman as a purple-haired monster and Billy Crystal as a one-eyed phlegm-looking ditto is something that will make you laugh until you drop and make you ask for more. But animation isn't the only issue here (although it's hard to overlook). There is also a very compelling story behind it all. And a very different, but nonetheless original take on why there are monsters in childrens closets...(and there are, you know). What would any monster with a logical sense be doing in a childs closet if it weren't to ""harvest"" their screams for energy-production to support the hard working inhabitants of Monstropolis. Original and witty. Go see it! If not for yourself...then do it to reassure your child that there is nothing in the closet and no monsters with pointy claws under their bed. Because monsters don't exist...right?! :-)","Monsters, Inc."

I was incredibly disappointed with Shrek when I saw it--the jokes were almost universally predictable and stale (not to mention that every potentially funny joke was in the TV commercials).

I liked Randall Boggs best and found myself sympathizing with him more than I ever have a villain before. The plot twist may have been foreseeable to some reviewers, but I was taken completely by surprise when I first saw it, and even seeing it again do not have any inkling about what it will be until it is revealed. The relationship between Sully and Mike is right on target, and the storyline is excellent. I did not see this for the humor, but for the plot and setting, and at these the movie is superlative. The only problem is that we do not have a PG-6 rating level, since it really doesn't deserve a PG-13 yet might be too scary for very small children.","Monsters, Inc."

Well, I didn't think they could but they have out done it again.  This story is so unique and with their incredible effects it is visual stunning.  The character of Sully, played by John Goodman, is a furry blue and purple monster.  Each hair on is body was so well done I felt like I could reach and and touch the soft fur.  The ensemble cast was incredible. Billy Crystal is fantastic as Mike and the adorable little Boo actually played by a 3 year old child is the best part of the film.  I can't wait to go out and buy all the merchandise.  I am gonna see this movie at least a few more times...","Monsters, Inc."

476,WolfDreamer,Best Animated Movie of the New Millennium,9,2 November 2001,"Without surprise. Pixar and Disney have done it again!  Monsters Inc. is a wonderful family film and is without a doubt the best animated film since the turn of the new century.  I nearly fell out of my seat with laughter in most parts of the film, and in some others I almost wanted to cry.  My 14 month old daughter could not take her eyes off of the film (it may have been what she recognized as a giant t.v. screen) and even my wife, who generally does not get entertained by animated movies, loved it.  It is a creative and cute film and it is just what I expected from Pixar.  Bravo!","Monsters, Inc."
477,SomethingLikeHuman,What a great idea for a movie!,9,13 November 2001,"Everything in this movie is gold!  The plot, the computer graphics, the actors, everything! The thing that most sticks out in my mind is the character Boo.  She has to be the cutest thing ever! Even the toughest of guys will have to agree. Admit it, a lot of times in movies kids can  get somewhat annoying, not here! Boo is just perfect.  John Goodman as ""Sulley"" also plays his part perfectly.  A genuine 4 star movie.","Monsters, Inc."

Next to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings which are fantastic films!! Monsters inc is funny and pull at those heart strings film. I will be watching it again! John Goodman and Billy Crystal are wonderful and I am sure the film just would'nt be right without them in it.,"Monsters, Inc."
479,cola_boy29,An Incredibly Funny Disney/Pixar Hit,10,5 November 2001,"Monsters, Inc is up there with Toy Story 1 & 2...possibly even better. Very funny, but also touching. I shed a tear near the end. The state of computer animation just gets better and better. I saw this movie in a DLP theater (digital light projector) so it was crystal clear. I kept looking at the tiny details like the body hair on Sully and the Abominable Snowman characters. Just amazing! And to top it off, Pixar included their animated short ""Birds of a Feather"" which nearly had me rolling on the floor with laughter. This is one of the films I can't wait to see again in the theaters. Even better than Shrek.","Monsters, Inc."
480,hallothere,this film is great!!,10,9 January 2007,"i love this film-it's a really clean film that doesn't rely on lots of jokes and slapstick to fill two hours..Boo is adorable-she has her own baby language but she's really cute. I especially love the part at the end when sully goes to see her again..I wished they had made a sequel but then again, who wants to ruin the magic of a film? watch monsters inc-they rock!! another pixar great-sorry to ruin all your fun but mike also swims along the credits of finding nemo and waves if your interested in seeing him again. also if you can understand a word of what boo says then let me know!! she says some funny things-her first word to sully (sorry for all the spoilers!) is bucket - i know that much!!","Monsters, Inc."

The magic of the film reeled her right in and she absolutely loved it.  As an adult, it was also very entertaining.  The jokes were funny and the characters were fresh.  At the very least, you gotta love Boo.","Monsters, Inc."

484,cinemaniac1942,Pixar works its unique magic once again,9,12 November 2001,"Pixar hasn't made a bad film yet.  In fact, it hasn't yet made a film that can be classified as anything less than excellent.  ""Toy Story"" (1995), ""A Bug's Life"" (1998), and ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) were all wonderful films with amazing state-of-the-art visuals and clever humor that children, teens, and adults can all enjoy.  ""Monsters, Inc."" is a film worthy of its predecessors' high acclaim.The voice talents and humorous sensibilities of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi excel in the well-written story line, which is satirical and at the same time innocent.  The story itself is, as usual, exciting and full of laughs and thrills.  It's a fantasy about the innocence of childhood and the classic good-triumphing-over-evil theme.The characters are so real, especially little Boo who wanders from her bedroom into the world of closet-monsters.  The animation has gotten so advanced that you can see every hair on lead monster Sulley's body rippling in the wind, and the facial expressions and mannerisms have gotten so real that they should start handing out Best-Actor Oscars to the animators and voice-overs.  Speaking of Oscars, ""Monsters, Inc."" should definitely contend for the new ""Best Animated Feature"" Oscar (though it's gonna have heavy competition from ""Shrek"").Hopefully in the future we will see more intelligent G-rated movies that all ages can enjoy.  While ""Shrek"" was an excellent movie, it didn't have the level of innocence that ""Monsters"" has that can let parents feel easy about the content their kids are viewing and hearing.  As long as Pixar is doing their thing, parents and their kids should be happy on their nights out at the movies.","Monsters, Inc."
485,salskent,"Good Family Fare, and that's about it",7,14 November 2001,"I seem to be bucking the trend, here.  I've watched the top two recent movies - this one, and ""Shallow Hal"" - and I liked Hal much more. Don't get me wrong; this is a fine family film, with good quality CGI, a solid, well-told story, and all the rest.  Go see it.  Your kids, 'specially those about 7 to 12, will go googly over it, and you'll have a fine time, too. But like some reviewers, I found this didn't seem to have the warmth and 'humanity' of Toy Story I and II, nor does it have the sass and splash of Shrek.  To me, its one of those efforts that is fine for what it is, I just happen to like more spunk, I guess. But by all means, take it in, especially if you have kids.  It's a sound effort (if a bit draggy in the middle), and Goodman especially does a very nice job building his character.","Monsters, Inc."
486,SthrnActor,I can't say enough good things about this film!,10,19 November 2001,"This is a great family film.  Kids AND adults should see it.  Not only is the animation spectacular, but the characters and story are great!  I am a 43-year-old male and I loved this picture.  I wish I had kids just to take to see this film.  Go, now!!!!!!!!!","Monsters, Inc."
487,askharr,"Monsters, Inc.",10,21 November 2001,I thought that it was going to be a movie totally geared towards kids. Boy was I wrong. I won't go into a long list of why you should see this while it is still in the theatre. Just do it. :) Pixar was on par with the graphics and the actors who provided the voices all did an excellent job. And Boo was just too darn cute.,"Monsters, Inc."

490,rhatfield,Way more than I would have ever expected!,9,2 October 2002,"I was pretty closed to this movie when I first was convinced to see it... I was thinking it would be another cheap Toy Story ripoff, like we haven't seen enough of them lately... I was completely entertained. I rank movies by what I call my ""Watch Scale"", the number of times I look at my watch during the flick... This movie passed with flying colors!","Monsters, Inc."
491,TJT684,Fantastic Movie to say the least,8,13 October 2002,"I think this movie was extremely well produced...

The story line is very cute and wacky funny.","Monsters, Inc."
492,ryanarmt,amazing,10,5 November 2002,this is singly along with Shrek the funniest animated and well made films ive ever seen. the charecter of mike is fantastic. i sat either laughing my head of or nearly crying at 'boo' who is thew cutest little thing. this should easily be #1 in the polls,"Monsters, Inc."
493,batesijj,very funny,9,2 September 2003,"I rented this film recently while on holiday along with 8 mile, sweet home alabama and the princess diaries and Monsters inc was easily the funniest of the lot. Boo's one liners (e.g while Sulley, Boo and Mike are hiding from Randall in a toilet cubicle and Mike gets stuck, after randall leaves, you hear this sort of squeaky squelch and water floods the cubicule and Boo gives a little 'Eww') give the film character though Mike's antics are easily the funniest, for instance, when he trips over his feet cartwheel into a dustbin and ends up with half a book shelf in his mouth. This film is a real comedy classic and a recent original from disney (quite a rareity) and is disney's answer to Shrek.","Monsters, Inc."
494,herbal_tea89,Great!,9,30 January 2012,"""Monsters Inc"" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"", and ""Disney's Tarzan"" are in.First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real.Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy ""kitty"" with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall and hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn't even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk.You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer. Almost like being in a theater!!","Monsters, Inc."
495,haythem-daboor,Great film,9,31 July 2014,"A really good movie that fits for all audiences. One of my all time favorites. Monsters, Inc. is a very moving story about Sacrifice and the power of love.n my opinion, the best animation movie ever made. Graphics may look ""old"" nowadays, but this is not the point. The story is based on a VERY clever concept, and the final result is very sweet. Monsters gain their energy consuming the cries of frightened children, and have developed methods and technology to ""steal"" it. The best ""frightener"" of the monsters has to deal with a... baby girl, that by accident enters the monsters' land, and ends up to treat her with love and care, and protects her from being seen, as babies are considered... health danger! Anyone who hasn't seen it should- it's brilliant.","Monsters, Inc."
496,quantumXL,Great actors GREAT MOVIE,10,3 January 2005,man what i have to say about this movie is so speechless. The graphics on this movie is so phenomenal. I couldn't believe how realistically the character reflect the persons voice. I'm a VERY BIG John Goodman fan. Although i might not know what he eats in the morning or what cloths he wheres i know hes a VERY good actor. His voice is VERY deep to a big man. He represents a big man and he is. So they placed him in the part of sulley. the big blue monster which does personify him personality. soft loving character. this may seem like a little kids movie but adults can watch this as well. lol the only fact that i don't like about this movie is that they travel through closets through doors. thats kinda cheesy but hey its a child movie.,"Monsters, Inc."
497,flosje18,Great movie,10,21 August 2013,"Summary As you can see in the title of the movie, it is about monsters who try to scare kids. Sully and Mike are monsters who are best friends. They work with each other at Monsters, INC. They have to scare kids and use their screams to have energy in their town. In their monster town kids aren't allowed. At work Sulley and Randall are enemies. They want to beat each other's score. Randall cheated after the work hours to beat Sulley his score. While he was cheating he accidentally let a kid out of a door. Sulley and Mike found that kid. At first they thought the kid was dangerous but it turned out she was a very sweet kid. Sulley got attached to her and he named her boo. The boss of the factory found out that a kid has escaped and closed down the factory. Sulley opened the factory again but instead of making kids scared they made them laugh.My opinion about the movie I did like the movie because it is for all ages and it is a nice and lovely story. It is a movie that make you laugh at any time and this is a very good aspect about it. At the end of the movie, the story could make me cry. Actually there is nothing bad about the movie. I recommend you to watch it. I love the movie very much. P.s.: The first movie is better than the second.(:","Monsters, Inc."
498,katy-shipway,Wow.........,9,8 December 2013,"I love this film. I'm not usually a fan of animated films, I find them emotionless and boring, but I think that with the relationship of Sully and Boo, mixed with the humor of Mike made this the perfect family film. I still love it today, years after it came out and will never pass up an opportunity to watch it. I think that one of my favorite parts of the film is the very end, when Mike gives Sully the present of Boo's door. It is lovely to see that Mike would do this, seeing as though he was not to keen on the child in the first place, and I have to admit that it brought me to tears. It is one of Disney Pixar's best films, in my opinion and one of the only ones I can watch the whole way through.The humor of when the monsters are describing t children, with 'lazer eyes' and 'mind powers' is truly funny and keeps the light heartiness of a child's film. And yet, the way Sully treats Boo can captivate the hearts of many people who prefer emotional films.Brilliant........just brilliant!!","Monsters, Inc."
499,laceycoan-23503,Love it,10,16 October 2015,Monsters Inc. is one of the best movies ever made I love watching it on Disney channel During Halloween i'm so glad they made a second one I wish they make and third one is just a really good kids movie to watch if you have not seen it or saying the second one I suggest you watch it because it's really good and I love it when that one monster gets a sock on his back and everybody freaks out oh and the lady who works at the desk is a snail she's just really funny I love the doors are the doors coming in and how they had to swing on the door-to-door to get little girl back to her right door and I love how they fell in love with the little girl it was so sad to let put her back in her room but this is just one really good movie I suggest you watch it every Halloween,"Monsters, Inc."

502,lekalonnie,Monster Inc,10,2 May 2017,"One of the best kids movie of all time. Monster Inc. brought everything and more to the table. It was able to make kids to grown laugh their pants off. It was capable of bringing grown men to tears and most of all, bring any and everybody together. Monster Inc. showed kids that sometimes what you think is a monster might actually be a friend. It showed how people could be different and come from different worlds but still be friends and love one another. I love the movie because you get to see all these different characters who love themselves even with their different facial or body features. Monster Inc is a movie that will last forever and ever. Monster Inc is its own Lion King. A movie even when your old and gray you would still watch and want your grand kids to watch too.","Monsters, Inc."

506,ckoehncke,You'll see it but won't like it.,6,5 November 2001,"What a disappointment! We've come to expect a lot from Pixar and the earlier films have not failed. Monsters is a failure. The story line, while novel, is weak and thin. The pace of the movie is a keen to a Saturday morning Bugs Bunny 3 min short. Nothing sets in and most of the film is spent in a chase scene of various sorts. Next is the lack of characters, Mike (the green ball) frankly isn't that interesting, he's almost cute, almost really funny, but then not. Sully (the furry guy) is the haphazard hero. The duo reminded me of the Lewis/Martin act. After these 2, nothing, zip, nada worth while.My kids are normally glued to any Disney event, but even at 90 minutes they were bored after 30. Nice try. BTW .. the little mini Birds shown at the beginning is excellent, unfortunately, it goes downhill from there.Regrettably, you'll see the movie because you have to, but save your money and go during the bargain hours.","Monsters, Inc."
507,cpcii,Outstanding Movie,10,4 November 2001,"As usual Pixar and Disney put together a great story and animation,  Where ever did they come up with this story line.  Great for children of all ages.

508,fredmolinski,Ten times better than Shrek!!!,10,3 November 2001,"I loved this movie, as did my kids and my wife.  It was very funny, very exciting, and surprisingly moving.  I admit it--I cried.  I also felt riveted to my seat.  John Goodman and Billy Crystal were perfect.  The ""door machine chase"" at the end was unforgettable.  I've been a little let down by Pixar--LOVED Toy Story, liked Bug's Life, liked Toy Story 2--but this one brought the magic completely back.  And made me realize just how overrated Shrek was.  I laughed at this movie more, it was completely emotionally satisfying, taught a great message, and the story never stopped moving (unlike Shrek, which didn't really seem to have anyplace to go).  Give this one the Oscar!","Monsters, Inc."
509,srsrhodes,"Dazzling production values, terrific story",10,2 December 2001,"Another classic from Pixar, equally appealing to kids and adults. Satire abounds for those who love it, but everyone should enjoy the speed with which the delightful story clips along, Randy Newman's soundtrack, and Pixar's technical expertise.","Monsters, Inc."
510,ZoNoLiTH,A well crafted kids' story which will also captivate adults.,9,14 February 2002,"Monsters Inc. is a very well produced kid's animation which can be watched by almost ""all the family"" - some elderly relatives may get confused by the pace of it all, but that's their fault.The movie breathes quality and I have no doubt it will ascend to same classic status as other Walt Disney pictures such as ""Snow White"" or ""101 Dalmatians"". Captivating moments abound, the entire film is *very* well produced, and the voice acting is superb. ""Shrek"" or ""Toy Story"", while looking gorgeous, still have a computer animated feel to them - not so with Monsters Inc.The film's universal appeal and top film status is also due to the quality of animation, the original ideas in the story - like the doors or the CDA (Child Detection Agency) - and just the sheer fun ness of the characters and the vast backdrop of the Monsters' metropolis. The director's attention to detail and the film's novel and often hilarious concepts, suck you into the Monsters' world and enthral.If you're an adult, Monsters Inc. probably isn't as funny as ""Shrek"", but kids will get more laughs. Hopefully, if there is a sequel, some more adult geared jokes could be chucked in.Overall, Monsters Inc. is a tremendous film which will undoubtedly stand the test of time.","Monsters, Inc."

513,phudgins,"Perfect casting, excellent plotline.",9,19 November 2001,"I have rarely had a movie that entertained my wife, my four year old daughter and I to the same level.  The humor was directed equally to children and adults, and the adult humor (and drama) was subtle enough to pass by a child without phasing him or her.  The plotline was both simple and complex, almost Lucas-like in this duality. Kids would enjoy the simple lower-level plotline without having to understand the more detailed, suggestive plot that is diverse enough to entertain their parents.  My family enjoyed this movie.  My daughter asked to see it a second time when it was over and I honestly considered it. The casting was done with perfect decision, even down to the smallest cameo (John Ratzenberger) as the Abominable Snowman, which looked strangely identical to the same one from the old Rudolph Christmas special..","Monsters, Inc."

Their confidence was apparent as the audience was treated to a sweet little pixar appetizer to whet our appetites before the real show (birds). We were surrounded by children of all ages at this 1:30 matinee - I do not recall ever being around so many children outside of grammer school (and I wondered why these parents all felt keeping their children home for this release was truly a wise decision). Regardless - their presence only seemed to sweeten the experience. I am not going to spill any beans - it's all about savoring the originality, artistic and technical wonders of this little dessert of a movie. Enjoy it waist-high in children, even if you have none of your own - Go and smile.","Monsters, Inc."
515,the_holc,What a creative masterpiece!!!,10,24 June 2006,"This movie is one of the most brilliant, creative and intelligent animated movies of all time, along with all the other Pixar Animation Studios' Movies. The characters are hilarious (Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski and John Goodman as Sulley was brilliant) and heartfelt, and the movie exposes raw sensitivity with the separation of Sulley and Boo. The animation is incredible, the humor is witty and the storyline is flawless. This movie should be seen by any Pixar fan, Billy Crystal or Goodman fan, or anyone who just plain likes funny movies, lighthearted ones. Pixar, you've done it again, made a brilliant epic masterpiece! Congrats! Watch out for another appearance by John Ratzenberger (Hamm, P.T.Flea etc.). Hint: Himalayas! Overall, loved it!

Our family of five (kids ages: 12,11,9) enjoyed it very much. From the previews I didn't expect very much, but the movie was one that didn't have any dull moments and kept you wondering what was going to happen next. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great as Sulley and Mike and the little girl was adorable (don't know whose voice it is). I would recommend this movie to anyone especially to those that have children. The only parts of it that you can call ""scary"" are not really all that frightening. The monsters in the movie are more cute & funny than they are scary. Go see it!","Monsters, Inc."

They seem to be getting better with practice over there at Pixar. This should be a big hit for Disney and decent competition for the upcoming Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings Movies.","Monsters, Inc."
524,borgorn,"Okay, it's cute, but... when does the story ever start???",4,9 March 2002,"I really was looking forward to this film. I even kept my expectations high for it when I saw it. Actually I was waiting for some action all the way through the whole movie until... until it suddenly ended! Yepp it just ended... before it even got started... It's a real petty, 'cause it could have been great... But the only feeling I had afterward was... was... eeh... Hmmm... Come to think of it I didn't feel anything, at least not concerning the movie cause I had already forgotten about it...No... Go see Shrek another time instead if you want to enjoy some pure comedy!","Monsters, Inc."
525,tonim1,Wonderful Movie for All Ages,10,11 November 2001,"All of us really enjoyed this movie. Our family ages that viewed were from 2 years - 49. The message it left you with was tremendous not just for children, but for all ages. Funny, scary and heart-warming all rolled into one. John Goodman and Billy Crystal are a great duo (even as monsters).I look forward to getting this one on DVD. Don't miss this movie!","Monsters, Inc."
526,kmoliver,Best movie ever!!,10,25 November 2001,I thought that monsters inc was the best disney movie I have ever seen It was so much better then toy story and all of the other movie. I really enjoyed it and can't wait till it comes out on dvd!!!! I am so going to buy it.,"Monsters, Inc."

528,drwenner,Not as good as other Pixar flicks,6,5 November 2001,Was not too thrilled with the movie. It had a good story but I was really hoping it would have been funnier then the other Pixar movies. I think it is worth going to see but just be prepared. But the kids will like and like the other Pixar flicks you have to love the characters,"Monsters, Inc."
529,rparlini,Another winner from Pixar,8,12 November 2001,"Although the plot, jokes, and dialogue of this movie may be a bit complicated for very young children, Monsters Inc. will please almost everybody.  Like Bugs Life and Toy Story, there are slapstick gags for the kids and wisecracks for the parent who take them. The gags come fast and furious, and they're built around a clever plot. The  animation is high quality, but not flashy.  The characters and the plot are central to this film, not the visuals.Arrive on time so as not to miss the animated short that precedes the movie","Monsters, Inc."
530,heavenlybrown-20742,Best Kids Movie!,10,19 August 2021,This is one of the best kids movies I have seen.

533,jhall-8,Such a cute movie!!,10,8 November 2001,I thought this movie was such a good movie.  I Liked how it gave several references to for instance Toy Story.  Boo was just too cute I really liked her Character.  But this is a must see movie for all ages.  Young or old I think it is a thumbs up great movie to go see.Make it a family night !!!,"Monsters, Inc."
534,lisaculbertson,"Disappointing, not funny, boring",3,4 November 2001,"I was truly disappointed.  I expected to find the humor that was in Shrek. I found myself looking at my watch.  My older daughter fell asleep.  The animation was great but I found the story and humor lacking. This is not one that I will purchase for video.  When I walked out of Shrek, I couldn't wait for it to come out on video.","Monsters, Inc."
535,WetnWash5,They've done it again!!!,10,3 November 2001,"Disney and Pixar have once again made computer animation seem real.The detail was MAGNIFICENT!!!(Sully's fur, for example). Billy Chrystal and John Goodman were excellent choices for the parts of Mike and Sully.The plot had a twist or two, but wasn't too over the top for kids. The same goes for the jokes/humor. The heroes were as lovable as the villains were un-lovable. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and we will probably see it again in the theater, which we rarely do. I will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD.","Monsters, Inc."
536,aequitas0,Pixar delivers a bland comedy,6,2 November 2001,"Although this movie was hardly as entertaining as the previous Pixar films, Toy story and its sequal Toy Story 2, it still contained fascinating humor that little kids as well as adults could enjoy.  What made the movie worth viewing in theatres is the mere fact that the trailer for episode 2 Attack of the Clones was beforehand.  After seeing a movie trailer of that magnitude brings down the entertainment value of the movie, well at least for myself and every other Star Wars fan.","Monsters, Inc."

Could easily be best picture of the year.","Monsters, Inc."
538,gabbo-1,greatest animated movie ever!,10,4 November 2001,This was a movie that taught a valuable lesson to the children who saw it.  It was also enjoyable for adults on another level.

539,humanwreck,"a perfectly Imaginative, whimsical and charming movie! wow!",10,6 November 2001,"Now I remember exactly what it was like, to be young ! This film brought back all those feelings; bright, imaginative, uncluttered and dazzlingly beautiful. It's been awhile since I got my full $7.50 worth at the movie theater...But this film, Monsters, Inc. reminded me how much fun the movies can be. The Characters, visuals, story, and attitude of the film itself are completely inventive, and wonderfully executed. I was pleasantly surprised at how much this movie brightened my day. Monsters, Inc. could easily earn the title of film of the year !","Monsters, Inc."
540,JimboBluejay,"Cute, but lacks!!!",1,5 November 2001,"If there would be one word to describe this movie it would be cute. This cuteness is the only thing that this film has going for it. It generally lacks any humor, minus a bit in the beginning. Overall it was a disappoint, but if cute is your thing then watch it, but at the end of this film the cuteness made my stomach a bit uneasy.","Monsters, Inc."
541,bowling_lady,Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!,9,6 November 2001,"What a great family movie.  The story was easy for children to follow, the animation was so well done that it kept the attention of very young children (and not enough to really scare them).  I have recommended this movie to everyone I have spoken too - even those without children.  I can hardly wait to see this movie again and I will see it again while it is still in theaters.","Monsters, Inc."

John Goodman and Billy Crystal made a wonderful pair!  The character of Boo was absolutely adorable and I found myself giggling when she giggled and weeping when she weeped. Innocence and imagination are indeed some of the most precious gifts life has to offer.So, if you get the chance, go out to see this movie, take your family/friends, anyone who needs a little cheering up.  It is always nice to know we have such wonderful resources like this to turn to in times like these.","Monsters, Inc."
544,dotoner,Finally - a 'kid's' movie suitable for kids of all ages!,10,11 November 2001,"Today I had the pleasure of taking my 3 year old to see a great film that both of us loved!While the premise of Monsters Inc. is about scary monsters that scare little children, the reality is that this movie was too cute and not too scary even for little ones.  It is a rarity when parents can take their children to a G-rated movie and not have one or two 'scary parts' to deal with or explain away to thier pre-schoolers later.  (Anyone who has seen Shrek or The Grinch with their young child knows what I mean) Monsters Inc. was G-rated all around.  Great humour, Great annimation, Generous voiced performances, Good all round fun!My three year old and I give Monsters Inc. a big 10.","Monsters, Inc."
545,tenchi muyo,It was o.k.,6,13 November 2001,"Billy Crystal and John Goodman did a good job, bringing the characters to life.  But, lets face it, this movie didn't come close to the humor offered by ""Toy Story"" or ""Shrek"".  It seemed to me that the characters where reaching for jokes a lot. The plot was not very exciting.  Actually, it was very predictable, you could sit through the first 20 minutes and predict what will happen at the end.  However, for kids seven and under this movie is great.  But, if you are over seven you can try your luck and see how you like it!","Monsters, Inc."
546,Michael8080,A Modern Classic,10,19 November 2001,"This is easily the best animated film I have ever seen.  The characters draw you into the story and lead you to a perfect ending.  I can't understand the favorable comparisons of Shrek to this movie.  Shrek was a crude, predictable, boring and unimpressive movie that left me feeling like I had just thrown away 7 bucks and 2 hours.  Monsters Inc. left me anticipating my next chance to get to the theater and see this film.","Monsters, Inc."
547,vinceanceic,The best movie in the world...,10,25 November 2001,"This movie is soooo good. It has speedily catapulted itself into my all-time favorite movie top 5.

548,jay_domingo,A blend of refreshing concepts for animated flicks,8,1 December 2001,"Coming from a streak of months of not watching any new movies just leaving myself to vegetate from work and school (and reading comments from imdb.com), this film was a much needed respite from all the ruckus of life.Having read all the comments here, most people express that Monsters, inc. either did not meet their expectations (as set by the previous toy story series) or gleefully accepted the movie. I highly respect those opinions. I do not aim to bleedingly criticize the movie constructively, but more on to comment on my appreciation of the movie.<spoilers> The movie capitalizes on the age-old idea of the ""boogieman"" or ""monsters"" coming out of children's closets. The twist in the whole plot is that, monster's are actually personified as also having the same lives as humans. Ironically, the monsters who scare the wits out of the children are also equally, if not more scared than their human opposites. The monsters believe that humans are toxic that even little kids aren't even spared from this belief. </spoilers>Some flavors of different movies in the past years has been subtlely used to enhance the plot. The creative use of the concept/plot was further expounded by the brief, yet lively built characters of the animation which makes the film more easier to absorb for its target market: children.
But then again, even if pixar/disney's alleged target audience was children, i'm sure it did not leave out some of the adults who were still young at heart and was intensely intrested to take some time off and just have a great time with their loved ones (or in my case myself).The subtle, yet amuzing blend of refreshing or familiar concepts make the film more likeable to its intended audience, and chances are, you might yell alongside with other youngsters: MIKE WAZOWSKI!C'mon guys/girls, when was the last time that you sat on a theater and felt that the movie has some new concoctions to offer to this world, which seems to be running out of creative ideas. =)No Technicalities, just pure fun and animation (with a little bit of drama on the side too).","Monsters, Inc."
549,rubenizm,Review,2,9 December 2001,"Contains Spoilers Excuse me for possible mistakes and incompleteness (i am writing an essay right now and this is the part of it)Monsters Inc. (M.I.) is the largest scream-processing factory in Monstropolis. The company generates energy from screams of human children. The top Scarer is James P. Sullivan, AKA Sulley, a huge monster with blue fur and purple spots on his body. His assistant - also his best friend and roommate - Mike Wazowski is a green, little one-eyed monster. Since the children are considered toxic and poisonous, it is absolutely forbidden for anything from the human world to cross into the monster world - even a stray sock alerts a task force. But one night after work, Sulley accidentally lets in a human girl. Named Boo, she is a threat for the monster race. But soon Mike and Sulley find out that she is actually very loyal and harmless to the monsters. She was supposed to be used for the experiment scream-mining machine of the most evil monster in Monstropolis, Randall. Later Mike and Sulley find out that Randall is completing the mission of Mr.Waternoose, the owner of Monsters Inc. Now Sulley and Mike are in a difficult situation because Mr. Waternoose and Randall want to kill Boo to eliminate any evidence of what happened. The Children Control Agency wants to eliminate the girl because of their confidence in the danger kids bring. But Mike and Sulley become friends with Boo so they don't want to give her to anybody. On the way to save Boo the monsters find many difficulties. After being caught Mike and Sulley are sent to the human world, from where they successfully escape. But finding Boo is not the most difficult thing for them, they must find Boo's closet's door, because the whole scaring system is based on closet doors. M.I. has millions of doors, and Mike and Sully must find the right one.","Monsters, Inc."

551,EllieGooding,hi,8,17 December 2013,I thought monsters inc was an amazing film i watched when i was a kid. They got the right actors to be in this film. I believe the actors in this film got along. Boo is my favorite character. I hope they do more films like monsters inc because they are really good. Randel was so nice in monsters university then he turned on mike that was so mean. I couldn't believe Ross was in Monsters university Monsters inc was way better then monsters university The animation in both of the films were so different I recommend you should watch it And make your own review I love watching movies so you should watch both of those films because they are good. And finally you should rate both of the films. Thanks for looking at my review,"Monsters, Inc."
552,ziyimaniac,The sweetest movie ever made for kids...and the kids at heart.,10,8 January 2002,"I had originally seen Monsters Inc. with some friends. Monsters Inc. took me back to those times when I wished that I was a little child, young at heart and carefree. At the final scenes unravelled, I find myself unabashedly in tears...I've never cried while watching a movie for a long time! Even my ten year old sister whom I invited to see MInc. was herself crying before the movie ends with the heart-stopping final sequence.Mind you, Monsters Inc. never becomes too sentimental in bringing a tear in your eyes. You've got to see this movie from the very beginning to see what I---and many others---mean. Definitely, the best CGI movie that Disney/Pixar has ever created, even better than Antz and Toy Story  and 2.","Monsters, Inc."
553,Jo Williams,"Good all round fun, 2 levels of humour. Colourful",5,21 January 2002,"An imaginative story line. Not only will it keep those little minds amused for the duration but everyone else.  The different characters will certainly capture their imaginations, where as adults may just think ""what the hell is that supposed to be""...typical of an adult...questioning it rather than just accepting it, for what it is.  My concentration did wonder a little but not enough to be critical.The voices suit the characters so well. Very well done, good fun and a film that the whole family can enjoy, even 14 - 19 yr olds!","Monsters, Inc."
554,cathyworthy,not of the expected standard,7,18 February 2002,"Whilst continuing the vein of Pixars previous releases, superb animation, wonderful characters the film has none of the more sophisticated humour for adults - kids will not enjoy as much as bugs life but certainly better than most of the dross produced by our friends over the pond","Monsters, Inc."
555,mark-569,Memorable...,9,21 February 2002,"Went to see Monsters because my children wanted to see it.  We all enjoyed the film and it was very funny in places, but not the most gripping film I've ever seen.  However, I have found that since seeing the film and looking back I think it is one of those films that will stay with you for a very long time.  I'm actually contemplating going to see the film a second time, which is most unusual for me!Make sure you are there for the beginning of the film as a typically funny Pixar short is shown first.  Also stay for the credits as there are some very funny ""out takes""!","Monsters, Inc."
556,stigoftdump79,Pretty darn good,8,3 March 2002,"I saw this film with three children, and they all loved it, and surprisingly, so did I.

But I'll definitely go and see more of them now!!I really enjoyed this movie, had quite a few laughs (I might even say more than I did watching any other movie lately!) and i can certainly recommended it to anyone, young or old, simply because it has everything you could wish for in a movie: hilarious jokes, touching scenes, nice music, nice characters to get attached to, and so on.And.. don't leave the theater when the credits begin to fill the screen! there's more to come!!!!","Monsters, Inc."
559,Battle_Royale,Some funny moments,6,29 May 2002,"Surely, the film was not as bad as I expected when I entered the cinema.The story is nothing for adults but for the little kids it's a film extraordinary to cope with their fear of monsters in the closet.Anyway, the whole movie has been drawn quite nice and there is a good sense of humor but compared with Shrek it's just another movie.I think there are too little ""hidden"" jokes referring to other movies or every-day-life-issues. I couldn't laugh out loud many times (unlike to the Shrek screening ;-) and as I left the theater I thought, OK, what we are doing next?","Monsters, Inc."
560,drivein4,Jaw-droppingly spectacular,10,13 January 2003,"I can't avoid the cliche: This movie is an instant classic, made with exacting attention to the true art of cinematic story telling.  What begins as a hilarious and mind-bending take on the hidden world lurking in the closets of our childhood nightmares, becomes a heart-pounding adventure for the welfare of a little girl that is punctuated perfectly with comedic flourishes and sentiment that will jerk a tear or two from the corner of your eyes.  And I thought Shrek was the end all with its rich characters and classic in-jokes--but this animated delight is the reason why Character and not Plot should dominate a film.  Rent it now.  But if you don't like it, have yourself checked out immediately to see if your heart is still beating. Chances are you died a long, long time ago.","Monsters, Inc."
561,navibrap,Disney's Reptilian Agenda,1,30 September 2018,"Released by the Reptilian Disney (666) organization, the 'monster' world did not have an energy source & so they walked through 'doors' (symbolic of inter-dimensional gateways) into children's bedrooms in the human world. There they would frighten children & when the kids screamed with fear, monsters would capture that energy in a tube & take it back through the door to power their world. The hero of the movie was, appropriately, a single eye (all seeing eye - a major Reptilian symbol.) Read your David Icke people. Walt Disney was a 33° Freemason & an Illuminist. Behind all those cartoons, magazines, movies etc., is a hidden agenda to mess up your children's minds. Disney's production over the years is filled with Masonic symbolism, occult over- & undertones, mind control & indoctrination. He is preparing our younger generations for the New World Order, & introduce them to sorcery (black magic) as being a ""cool thing"". Read your Fritz Springmeier as well people.","Monsters, Inc."

564,n_fortynine,Top Ten?,1,1 August 2003,"I can't see any reason why this animation should be in the top ten of the IMDb list. Having watched it about three, four times yet I haven't found anything that I particularly LIKED about it - maybe it's the way the characters are so-predictably handled, maybe it's the same old Disney-style hero-villain plot, maybe it's just because MI's something that goes in and out of your head so tastelessly it doesn't even leave a trace (I've got the same feelings when I watch Disney's films - but at least sometimes a soundtrack make a little impression - this one doesn't even have a good one).To say the least I've always treated animes with more respect than American animations - maybe because after all you'll see that American producers have but one way to express their theme. Having excellent CG doesn't cut it, unless, of course, if you're just after the huge budgets. MI just like most American animations on this ""top 50"" is after the ""cool"" look, and no-content. I mean no offense, but if you really liked this movie, you really should be watching better stuff.","Monsters, Inc."
565,tlove79,"Monsters, Inc., A quirky twist on the interactions between monsters and humans",9,3 May 2016,"This family-friendly animation takes place in the world of monsters. At Monsters, Inc., the monsters enter doors, leading to the closets of children on a quest to scare as many of them as possible to fill up energy tanks that help keep their city powered. As with many companies, Monsters, Inc. keeps track of top performers, thus invoking a competitive spirit amongst the monster employees. Things change when Sullivan, also known as Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) stumbles upon a little girl named Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) and is forced to face and perhaps overcome his fears.Sulley is the top scarer and has been for many months. His best friend Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) stays close by helping him stay in top performer shape, though he sometimes gets sidetracked by his romantic interest, receptionist Celia (voiced by Jennifer Tilly). Sulley's fiercest competition comes from Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do whatever he can, with some help from his sidekick Fungus (voiced by Frank Oz), to snag the top spot from Sulley, including cheating. Humans, primarily children, are a feared species, so when Boo, who Randall has a lot of success frightening, enters Monsters, Inc., it changes Sulley's life forever. Initially, Sulley is afraid and does everything he can to get rid of Boo. As Sulley gets to know her, over the course of time, he becomes less fearful and even turns into Boo's protector. Eventually, Sulley learns that his fear, along with the other monsters, of children is misguided and over exaggerated due to lack of knowledge. This makes me think of the movie Inside Out and how our emotions can lead us astray if we don't keep them in check. Once Sulley gains some insight, his new awareness ultimately leads to a delightful change in how business is conducted at Monsters, Inc. There were shadowy effects throughout the film which added a sense of suspense. However, the lighting on Sulley is soft, which gave warmth to his character, even though he's one of the largest monsters. The transitions from scene to scene were smooth. The music effects are suspenseful, happy and playful in the right areas. The attention to detail in all sectors made the movie thrive. I really enjoyed Monsters, Inc. I would rank it as one of my favorite animated movies. The writing is funny and witty, and the props are clever. I look forward to watching it again. It was a nice spin on overcoming fears and not judging a book by its cover. Two lessons that are universal and relatable to all ages, races, and genders.","Monsters, Inc."
566,steviemitchell,Not a patch on Toy Story 2/Iron Giant.,5,5 August 2003,"I'm surprised to see this in the top 150.  I didn't think the story flowed very well, the characters aren't as fleshed out as other recent animated/cgi romps (Toy Story 1 & 2, Iron Giant).  And compared to some of the wonderous Japanese Anime around, such as Princess Mononoke, My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away, it seriously lacks emotion.  It didn't hold my attention well either.  The little girl is cute though!One for the kids and the kids only.5/10.","Monsters, Inc."
567,asharp16,kids movie,7,28 November 2013,"Cute, funny movie. Obviously targeted for kids. The message is good and the plot is steady. It's simple, but not so dull that it loses the interest of anyone watching, children or adults. You can watch the movie as a family (as most Pixar movies). The animation is good and the dialogue is funny. The characters are cute as well as easy to relate to, even though they are monsters. Helps teach kids not to be afraid, without being too over the top. Not scary at all. Pixar may not be able to top Toy Story, but this movie is another excellent example of what they do best; sweet, relate able, family films that transcend age groups and reach out to everyone.","Monsters, Inc."
568,vestavia,"Technically not as perfect as Nemo, but nicer story",10,8 January 2004,"I missed this Pixar movie when it was playing on the big screen, so my review is based on the DVD version. The computer animation works beautifully, but where the movie really shines is the story. Who would have thought that the monsters are afraid of little boys and girls, but they have to hide in closets and scare little kids at night because their screams power the electric utility company of Monsterville. With the help of a little child that is not at all afraid of monsters, our two heroes uncover a conspiracy of grandest proportions, but that's all I will tell you here. After all, you should go out and rent the movie for yourself. Personally, I like Monsters Inc. better than Nemo, it's in a close tie with Shreck, and only second to Spirited Away in the animated category.","Monsters, Inc."

570,astutekitty,One of the most endearing animation films created,10,16 January 2005,"Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors.","Monsters, Inc."

572,jiklera,Monsters University teaches zombies how to Heat the box office.,10,1 July 2013,"For the second straight week, Monsters University takes home the box office winning again over World War Z.This time the winning team Disney/Pixar made $46 million in the U.S. for an impressive total $171 millions in two weeks. The Heat, with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, took second place with $40 millions in its debut week. Brad Pit and his zombie flick only could make third with $29 millions, leaving zombies wanting for more.It is a bit of a surprise that WWZ is doing so modest in the box office in spite of all the publicity and marketing. But in the other hand, maybe we can think of summer as the reason for this overturn to the Max Brook's book film version.In my visit to the theater to watch the second installment of the Monsters Inc 2001 film, the audience was almost all kids with one or two parents. This maybe made it easier for the animated film to make more money in the U.S., as long as kids are in summer break and parents are willing to sacrifice themselves for them; or shouldn't I have called it sacrifice? Pixar Studios, in my opinion, have found the formula to create stories that could entertain both kids and parents at the same time. To name some: Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and the most recent Toy Story 3. Story lines well told, impeccable animation, comedy and a lot of the Disney Magic is what makes these films so attractive to all audiences.Monsters University belongs to this category. The animation of the campus is absolutely beautiful. Screenwriters, Dan Scanlon and Daniel Gerson, recreated the before lives of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan in a smart way. But the story line that for me was more relevant was the bullying that Wazowski was victim of.This is a theme that in the U.S. public opinion is being trending for the past years, so it was not difficult to feel related to easily. So for the rest of the story, I won't make more explaining in order not to spoil the movie to those who have not seen it yet. But I have to say that any person, who has had the experience to attend any classroom of any type, will enjoy this film.Also the performances of Billy Cristal (Mike) and John Goodman (Sullivan) were pleasant to the ears. It felt like it hasn't been 12 years since Monsters Inc., and more impressive is that they were portraying those characters voices in their younger spirits. Thumbs up to these good actors.By far, Monsters University belongs to the elite group of sequels (and in this case prequel) that have made a presentation that it's original and yet keep the essence of its previous one. Also, it could become one of the most successful movies for the team Disney/Pixar, even though is quite a hard task to beat the incredible $1,064,404,880 box office score of Toy Story 3 worldwide gross.Nevertheless, while we wait for that to happen, what we can say for sure is that zombies are not happy by the fact they have been beaten by two chicks in a cop flick, and by monsters that were meant to scare kids but that have been heating the numbers for two weeks in a row.Five stars to Monsters University make me say that it is mandatory for parents to take their kids to see it. And for those who enjoy the Disney magic, in this case seasoned with the Pixar originality, please don't miss this change to be entertained with a good movie.","Monsters, Inc."
573,tannaihatembo-730-268842,Monsters Inc is a beautifully crafted movie thats fun and hilarious for everyone!,10,5 July 2013,"A Colorful Feel Good MovieFrom its creative take on the child imagination of monsters in the closet to its advanced animations, directors Pete Docter, Lee Unkrich, and David Silverman outdid other Pixar films like Toy Story, A Bugs Life or Brave. If you've watched 2012's recent movie release of Monsters University then you have to see what's still considered one of today's most hilarious motion pictures, 2001's Disney production Monsters Inc.! Scream Heat corporations top scarer's and best friends Mike Wazowski ( Billly Crystal) and James p. Sullivan ( John Goodman) exist in a colorful Metropolis filled with businesses, and homes powered by the extracted energy of screaming children. The lime green, M&M cyclone Mike, and blue, bear-like monster Sully, share their passion for scaring in a virtual world that can be accessed through an assembly line of doors to the bedrooms of sleeping children. Among other monsters the pair live to scare, but must avoid contamination that is believed to be outcome of touching a toxic child. Mike struggles with juggling work and girlfriend Cecilia, a tall purple one eyed receptionist, while Sully works to impress father like figure, and boss Henry J Waternoose at the organized scaring factory. As they work against their biggest rival, a nasty and vicious reptilian Randall Boggs to achieve the all-time scaring record, Sully accidentally leaves open a door allowing what their city considers to be the biggest threats to their lives to enter; a child. The tale kicks off when panicky Mike and Sully encounter the little girl and are faced with the challenge of returning her to her door without being contaminated or seen. This is proved difficult when Randall discovers the mistake and searches for the four year old for his own evil and selfish agenda.The movies hilarious aspects are displayed throughout the individual roles of each character along their pursuit to return the trespassing infant Boo. Comedic Mike is always one step behind his best friend with funny outburst and witty comments. Randall's dark character allows the film to venture into a seriousness that keeps the audience frantic and guessing. Adorable pigtailed Boo's playful and realistic infant like curiousness makes it difficult to look away. Other characters like always contaminated George, Mike-worshipping Smitty and confused Needlemen are beautiful additions that bring general humor to the film. The plots outbursts of sly one-liners and unrestrained antics lead the film into uncharted zones of hysterical laughter.The detailed graphics presented in Monsters Inc. are brilliant! Each character brings a unique sense of physical humor. Mikes green M&M structure and one large eye is just as hilarious to look at as his voice, played by Bily Crystal, is to listen too. The fuzzy blue like bear and Scream Heat corporations top scarer James P. Sullivan is a great combination of scary and compassion. With so many monsters of different shapes, and sizes there is never a dull aspect in the movie. The entire city is yet another eye catching detail the graphic designers of Monsters Inc. so brilliantly crafted. I personally love this movie and recommend everyone take time out of their day to watch Monsters Inc.! Its dramatic twists, colorful plot and unique characters keep you guessing about what could happen next. From start to finish, the ten star Pixar animation is a hilariously touching delight! With lots of laughs and the perfect amount of mild scares this fun film is suitable for all ages.","Monsters, Inc."
574,aahmedze,Awesome!,10,8 September 2013,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, you don't know what you're missing out on! It has humor that isn't hard to understand, therefore anyone can watch it and still have a laugh. I actually lost count on how many Monsters Inc. there is now but the original is (nearly) always the best. Go out and buy this movie (if you haven't already) and enjoy re-living your childhood all over again! I just can't sum up how awesome this movie is! Wow, I need to write 10 lines of text AT LEAST... I don't really know what to write anymore because I don't want to spoil it for others who might have not yet watched it. I think I'll just give you the names of the 2 main characters. The short, green, one-eyed one is called Mike Wazowski and the big, blue, furry one is called James P. Sullivan.","Monsters, Inc."
575,swapnil-andraskar,awesome story,8,22 February 2014,"animation and the fur work is very nice.... ..i like 1 st part movie more than this movie but overall is good to see again those character ...... and wanna see again n againThis is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too. more over we enjoy a lotThere is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too.","Monsters, Inc."
576,devine-neve,Great Film for All Ages,10,15 December 2013,"Monsters, Inc. proves to be a movie for all ages. As a child, I was entertained by the funny ""kitty,"" his partner-in-crime, and their surprising pal. Now, I watch this film and am still entertained. However, I now realize the impressiveness and complexity seen in Monsters, Inc. The competitive world that I have since entered from the first time I watched this movie is practically displayed in the monster world. Along with the competitive spirits of Randall and Sully, is Sully's attachment to an unlikely friend, and the difficulty of letting go. Sully must say goodbye to Boo, as she reenters the human world. This scene is so relatable, that for an instant, we forget the differences between the monster world and the real world. Monsters, Inc. provokes many emotions, and ultimately allows for people of all ages to have a pleasurable experience they won't soon forget.","Monsters, Inc."
577,joshuakeley,Love this film,9,11 June 2018,The animation speaks for itself. It showcases what can be done in the world of computer animation when it comes to feature films. The story is great and has a very nice level of depth to it.,"Monsters, Inc."
578,TonioHaze,Underestimated piece of contemporary philosophy,9,22 July 2015,"Behind the highly overrated clean animation characters with big eyes and clumsy looks that those big babol chewing Disney CEOs keep promoting, lies silent a very stimulating concept: that logically when there's something unknown to ""face"", we get way more energy from trying to making it better, than from avoiding it following the instincts that are pushed by our own fear. The wisdom of the screenplay is right in front of the viewer, but hidden by the colored masks of the funny and clumsy monster drawings. This movie helps people being less afraid of whatever they're afraid of, and - for how ordinary it might seem - this is one of the greatest purposes one artist can decide to chase. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, that is with inspiration.","Monsters, Inc."
579,joyhymon,Very Funny!!!,8,21 December 2014,"Loved it! This is the type of movie that has it funny parts and parts that also warm the heart. A great family movie but also a great movie for all ages to enjoy. With a awesome all star line-up providing the voice overs for each character, adding in their own personal flavor, I assure you that you will be thoroughly entertained.I personally gave the movie an 8 out of 10 for humor, a great story line, and the ability to hold my attention and my son's attention. Already made it one of our many Disney movie selections when we have family time once a week. But if you don't want to take my word for it, go get the movie and give it a try.","Monsters, Inc."
580,andrew-bendon,Awesome ....,10,9 February 2015,"What a film.. For young and old .. Will make you cheer and with joy and laugh till your belly hurts and cry if your a big softy.. A film you can watch time after time. Colourful and enjoyableSulley only scares for the good of the monster world, and doesn't want to scare Boo off duty.Mike and Sulley let nothing get in the way of their friendship. Pixar never made a bad movie and this a perfect example of my opinion. Enjoy this movie for a perfectly appropriate cartoon. Very mild ""scary scenes "" Despite their terrorising tactics, it turns out that Sulley and Mile are as scared of the children as the children are of them, with actual contact bringing the feared intervention of the Child Detection Agency. So when Sulley finds the girl Boo is endeared to him rather than afraid, he and his one-eyed Mike have to protect their reputations.","Monsters, Inc."
581,griml001,"When a little girl is released into an unknown world, chaos ensues...",8,30 June 2005,"Pixar have, it seems, done it again. Coupled with breath-taking animation and a superb storyline, Monsters, Inc. has achieved something truly incredible- a film able to entertain not only children, but those 'over the hill' too.The basic plot is that there is another universe, full of the monsters that one sees in childhood hiding under your bed or in your closet. These monsters go to all different parts of the world through portals in the doors to be able to scare the children, and in return collect the children's screams, as it is, for them, a form of energy. But chaos ensues when a little girl is accidentally let into the Monster World, and a more sinister plan is revealed...The voice acting, for one, is superb, with each character's personality shining through magnificently. The actors were chosen well, with John Goodman as the cheery James P. Sullivan, and Billy Crystal providing the voice of the marmite-esquire character Mike Wazowski. (Marmite because you either love his quirky jokes, or hate his boastful nature.) Also, a kudos has to be given to Steve Buscemi for playing the sinister, yet, in my opinion, weirdly lovable character of Randall Boggs- his voice fits perfectly.All in all, this film is definitely not one to be missed, and deserved all of the praise it has received.","Monsters, Inc."
582,laurafaye-2,good film,9,15 April 2016,"I really liked this film it is one of whose films you can watch over and over. This is a film for all age groups which is good when you have the family around and can't decide what to watch.The voice work of John Goodman and Billy Crystal as Sully and Mike is perfectly meshed, the two working together to make their characters come alive.The film is about good verses bad. I liked the bond that was formed between Boo and Sulley when Sulley realised that Boo was no harm to them.It is not as good as Toy story as the story line is not as strong but still very watchable. The animation in this film is wonderful, the characters are well designed and have well developed personalities, particularly the two leads.","Monsters, Inc."
583,dilos-26128,Would 've been great minus the annoying child,1,20 May 2015,"Would 've been great minus the annoying child. Monster inc starts great. The whole concept of monsters being scared of little children is funny in an ironic kid of way. The depiction of the monsters world is enjoyable although it is filled with clichés that dominate most movies. The movie is an easy 8 up to the point it introduces the annoying child that runs into trouble all the time, but miraculously escapes danger every time although the whole city of monsters inc is looking for it. You have the best of the monsters inc monster failing to get rid of a child who is 1/10th of its size. Then sulley grows fond of it and protects it although its supposed to be toxic and she is moaning, crying and being annoying in every way imaginable. Is it cute when a child misbehaves cries and moans all the time? I guess for the screenwriters of monsters inc it is, proving beyond any doubt that they are useless and incapable of coming up with a sweet character for a child. Those are the qualities people dislike in children. I guess if you are 5 years old you are going to enjoy the movie. Personally I couldn't stand it and stopped watching after 1 hour. Waste of my time.","Monsters, Inc."

585,gabriellacardinale,My entire childhood,10,15 May 2016,"Monsters Inc. was basically my entire childhood. It was made a few months after I was born, so I kind of grew up watching it. It's cute and sweet and I've watched it more times than I can count! Excluding spoilers, it's about a change of heart between two unlikely friends. A monster and a toddler. The monster, Sully, has the job of scaring children. However, Sully develops an attachment to Boo. Boo is the toddler that changes the way he sees human children. The movie is definitely family-friendly. Some people also believe that this movie contributes to the wild ""Pixar Theory"". Overall, it's a cute movie to watch even as an adult.","Monsters, Inc."

587,bryanrivera15,Monster's Inc. Review,10,15 December 2005,"There's A Monster in My Closet!I would definitely recommend Monster's Inc. to people of various ages. Not only would I recommend this movie for its endless comedic scenes, but also because of its refreshing story line. The combination of these two elements makes this film relatable to everyone for we seem to seek for movies that allow us to express amusement or for a new plot. Furthermore, the unique characters added to the overall appearance of the film.I watched the film Monster's Inc. at the comfort of my own home on Saturday, November 13th, 2005 at approximately five o'clock in the afternoon as I listed my twenty dialectics and worked on my Film Reflection Journal.I recommend Monster's Inc. to anyone for it contained many comedic parts. I believe that people of all ages would relate to this film because it achieved to have both humor for children and adults. It has the simple amusing scenes that children would laugh at for example when Sully gets stuck in the trash can and books fall on his head and there were also the new generation, hilarious scenes that adults would get such as the scene with the Abominable snowman. Its story line was another factor that would make everyone admires the movie. It was unique in the sense that everything that happened in the film was nothing like any other movies that I have seen. The beginning started out with Mike and Sully doing their regular routine of getting up, greeting everyone monster they pass by, and going to work where they would scare children for the sake of Monstropolis. Then a child from the human world comes into their lives, which will eventually affect the city of Monstropolis including theirs.The characters in the film were made for the purpose of having the audience see a whole different side of them rather than focusing on their appearances. People could relate to the characters for they showcased personalities that we would display. They showed traits like jealousy, greediness, love, caring, confidence, anger, and more. Being able to relate to these characters allows us to become more attached to the movie for we see ourselves in the figures that are in the screen. We tend to remember some parts of our lives when something similar occurs in the movie. The last parts of the film showed Sully and Mike getting chased by Randall, who was attempting to capture Boo. I remembered my aunts chasing my cousins and me as we rode around with tricycles in the Philippines. This brought back memories from when this happened to me.In my opinion, I think that the movie would relate more to children than adults for some reasons. First, the characters were full of life and animated, which would suit the likings of children. It included a lonely but friendly Abominable snowman who wanted to be accepted. Secondly, the character of Boo speaks for every child who watched the film. There were probably some children who felt the same way that Boo did and possibly even have dealt with a similar problem. I know that I related with Boo because she brought me back to my past time when I had dilemmas with monsters at night. If I could relate to Boo, I know that other children will as well. The way that the monsters went to work and used the doors of children to enter their realm and scare them was a brilliant idea. This concept really tied the whole movie together. It was a critical part of the film for this is where Sully and Mike met Boo. The way that they competed on who can gather the most screams from children affected the movie in a positive way for it added more comedic parts in it.If you are looking for an animated yet memorable movie to watch that contains drama and comedy, Monster's Inc. is the film to choose.","Monsters, Inc."
588,sameerahvillot,cool,10,31 May 2018,My favorite person in this movie is boo and mike. it funny how boo try to the monster as friend and dont what them to leave her,"Monsters, Inc."
589,venus-43937,A Movie With A Bigger Picture.,10,1 May 2018,"In this loving, yet fun kid's movie, the main characters change their world through friendship, justice, and sacrifice. One of the main characters is Sullivan. Sullivan is a big, tall, furry, blue and green monster that has a loving heart for a different creator than himself. His best friend, Mike, is a short, round, all green, one-eyed fellow who only cares about himself and not the world around him. Mike drives a sports car and inspires to climb the corporate ladder. Sullivan, also referred to as Sully, walks to work, and genuinely cares about the environment and the creators being harmed by the creation of their energy supply. Mike and Sully work for Monsters, Incorporated, who power the world of Monstropolis with the screams of human children. When a child named Boo enters the monster world, a panic is created. Human children are poisonous to monsters, or so they think. A series of events happen that lead the monsters to capturing the child and realizing her laughs supply more energy than her screams. At the end of the movie, Sully and Mike take over the Monsters, Inc. and use the newly found energy source (laughs) as their only energy source. The children are no longer scared of monsters in their closet but get a laugh when monsters enter into the human world. 
A friendship like Woody and Buzz from Toy Story, Mater and Lightning McQueen from Cars, or even Remy and Linguini from Ratatouille, all show that true friends can overcome obstacles in life. It also shows that one outgoing friend and one conservative friend can join forces and change the world they live in for the better. 
Even above friendship, justice, and sacrifice, I think the overall picture is saying we need a better energy source that doesn't harm the environment. It's a long shot, but it makes sense to relate their story to ours. They go against the grain to fight for better energy sources that give them more energy in the long run.","Monsters, Inc."
