0,Leofwine_draca,"No classic, but a fun sci-fi/action/horror hybrid",6,24 November 2016,"For starters, UNDERWORLD is a hugely derivative film, and that's one of the biggest things working against it. The vampire vs. werewolf plot might not be too familiar – after all it's been a long time since those Universal monster flicks – but most of the scenes in the film bear the influences of other, better films. For instance the vampire society/hierarchy recalls BLADE, the clothing/action recalls THE MATRIX, and even the scene in the car in which the werewolf guy is pushing spikes through the roof is a rip on TERMINATOR 2. Despite these lame moments and lapses of originality, and the fact that the film is saddled with an unlikeable heroine, UNDERWORLD ain't so bad. The story has a few interesting things to say and director Len Wiseman holds things together well, inserting lots of style into the proceedings; suddenly I'm not so disheartened about him directing DIE HARD 4, after all.The film is packed with shoot-outs and battles and, while Kate Beckinsale's two-pistol posturing is frankly embarrassing, the violent werewolf attacks are cool and the silver/daylight bullets add some fun to the events that play out. The script, although derivative again, flows along quite nicely and, aside from the central heroine, there isn't really much to dislike. I found this film to be efficient if unoriginal. There's quite a decent cast here, with newcomer Scott Speedman acquitting himself reasonably well as the human caught up in the chaos, and Michael Sheen stealing all of his scenes as chief werewolf, Lucian. Kate Beckinsale is sometimes good – in HAUNTED, for instance - but I couldn't stand her here; she's trying too hard to be 'cool' but never escapes the fact that her character is nothing more than a Trinity-from-THE-MATRIX knock-off.Elsewhere, Bill Nighy camps it up as an evil age-old vampire and Kevin Grevioux nabs the best character in the whole film, a hard-ass, hulking werewolf who redefines the meaning of cool. Sophia Myles looks stunning, and I couldn't help wishing that she'd taken the leading role instead of Beckinsale. As to be expected/hoped, the special effects are fantastic, with CGI work coming up trumps throughout. The werewolves themselves aren't great – they recall the fuzzy shapes in AN American WEREWOLF IN Paris a little too much – but the transformations are astonishing and the head-slicing at the end, while too much like BLADE, is a triumphant moment. The film is surprisingly gory for its rating/audience which is also a pleasant surprise, making it that bit more palatable for adult audiences. Followed by UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION, this is a fun flick, not a classic but a watchable film at least.",Underworld
1,SnoopyStyle,Cool Sexy Cool,8,1 August 2014,"There has been a war between the Vampires and Lycan even six centuries after the supposed death of the Lycan leader Lucian (Michael Sheen). Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the great Death Dealer or ones who hunt down the Lycans. The Lycans are supposed to be close to extinction. However Selene battles the Lycans to a possible underground pack with more advanced weaponry. She becomes interested in human Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who seems to hold the key to the war and a mystery that is centuries old.There are really only two elements to this movie. It's the cool looking all-encompassing action, and Kate Beckinsale in her leather outfit. The story isn't very deep. It goes right into a war. There isn't much setup. Not much is really needed. Then there is the super sexy Kate. She looks cool in her action mode. She is without a doubt the movie's best asset.",Underworld
2,Horst_In_Translation,Vampires vs. werewolves pre-Twilight,4,19 May 2016,"These two never get along with each other and this was also already the case in the American movie ""Underworld"" from almost 15 years ago. The writer and director here is Len Wiseman and he also worked on all the sequels that follow up on this one, also the upcoming as this series here, in contrast to Twilight is still running and dishing out a new installments every couple years. I personally found Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen the most interesting performances and their characters the most interesting as well from this movie. I guess it was not their fault that I did not end up liking this film. One major reason may be that the (director's cut) version I watched easily went for longer than two hours. And I have to say the story material they had here, looking only at the important and successful stuff, is no more than 90 minutes. Probably less. The rest felt just like incredibly forgettable filler material.That is why, in my opinion of course only, it is far from justified that this has become such a long-running series. Maybe I'm not doing the makers justice, but if we are looking at the entire franchise, they really need to step up their game compared to this one here, especially in terms of essentialism and focus. And maybe also in terms of more interesting characters as this film relies a lot on makeup and tries to make up for lack of great character development and elaborations. I will maybe check out some of the more recent installments at some point in the future and see if they managed to do so. I guess this series is only still running because people still go to the theaters to watch these films, so you cannot really blame the makers for that fact. This is how things roll today in terms of franchises that include many movies. As for how it all started, namely with the 2003 film ""Underworld"", I dish out a thumbs-down and don't recommend the watch.",Underworld
3,Prismark10,The doors,6,19 June 2017,A comic book Gothic horror adventure film with a sort of a female version of Blade clad in leather. Plenty to enjoy apart from a derivative and wafer thin story.Vampires and Lycans (Werewolves) have been at war for centuries. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) a vampire death dealer hunts Lycans and is attracted to a human called Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who the other Lycans are looking for. It seems he is a descendant of the head of the werewolf family and the Lycans want to use Micheal to create a vampire- werewolf hybrid.This is a shallow stylish film but entertaining with enough action and at least a backstory which gives it some interest. Some hammy acting from the vampires who do not have a decent script to get their teeth into.,Underworld
4,claudio_carvalho,Great Gothic Adventure,8,2 December 2004,"Vampires and werewolves are fighting against each other in a battle of hundred of years. In the present days, the gorgeous vampire Selena (Kate Beckinsale) is a werewolf killer warrior. Both races use very special guns: the vampires use a bullet made of silver nitrate, while the werewolves use a sort of special bullet with daylight glow. The werewolves chase the human Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), and Lucian (Michael Sheen), the leader of them that is supposed to be dead, bites Michael. Selena is intrigued with the interest of the werewolves in Michael, and while protecting him, she falls in love with him. Kaven (Shane Brolly), the leader of the vampires' coven, does not pay much attention on the observations of Selena about Michael. She decides to wake-up Viktor (Bill Nighy), the ancient leader of the vampires, when deep secrets are disclosed. 'Underworld' is a great Gothic adventure. Once all the characters are night creatures, the story takes place along the night and the dark photography is wonderful. The acting is good, but the grimaces of Shane Brolly, trying to look evil, are the weak point of the film. However, the story hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Underworld – Anjos da Noite' ('Underworld – Angels of the Night')Note: On 12 November 2006 I saw this film again. Note: On 27 January 2017 I saw this film again.",Underworld
5,kosmasp,Sexy back,7,3 May 2012,"Kate Beckinsale brought sexy back with this movie. Back from the undead that is. I'm assuming you know what the movie is about, though I'm not gonna spoil anything about the end of the movie, I put the spoiler tag up for those who want to be surprised. I doubt that you haven't heard about the movie. This is the one that made vampires vs. werewolves legitimate again! Plus it also brought those weird leather costumes back. I'm sure some people got their fetish from this. But it's not the costume that made the movie for me. It's Kate and Billy N., who both are great in their respective roles. You also get Scott Speedman as love interest, so both sides are equally covered here. The action is great too and the movie obviously was successful enough to spawn another 3 installments. Only two of them had Kate in them though",Underworld
6,gavin6942,Vampires Versus Lycans,6,29 July 2016,"Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a beautiful warrior, is entrenched in a war between the vampire and werewolf races. Although she is aligned with the vampires, she falls in love with Michael, a human who is sought by werewolves for unknown reasons.What so you get if you create a world of sleek vampires, make them angry at a world of werewolves, infuse some ""Matrix"" mojo, and add a blue-grey lens to the camera? You might think ""Twilight"" or ""True Blood"" or something else, and you'd be right. Add a butt-load of guns, and you would have ""Underworld"".Is this Kate Beckinsale's breakout role? I mean, I know she did some BBC films or something classy, but if you live in my bubble (the genre film bubble), this is what you most associate her with, sort of like Milla Jovovich in ""Resident Evil"". And with about thirty sequels, why not?",Underworld
7,jboothmillard,Underworld,3,13 November 2008,"I knew this film was about vampires and werewolves, and I knew the lead actress, but that's about it, so I suppose I had to give it a go, from director Len Wiseman (Die Hard 4.0). Basically a war rages between the vampire and Lycan (werewolves) races, and Selene (Van Helsing's Kate Beckinsale) the beautiful vampire warrior, is entrenched in it. There is a plot to kidnap Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), after he is proved to hold the key to ending the war (something to do with his blood). Selene also discovers a plot to combine the strengths of both races to create a new invincible species of predator. You find out by the way that the war started because of the death of a vampire's wife, caused by a Lycan. Also starring The Queen's Michael Sheen as Lucian, Bill Nighy as Viktor, Shane Brolly as Kraven, Erwin Leder as Singe, Sophia Myles as Erika, Robbie Gee as Kahn, Kevin Grevioux as Raze and Prison Break's Wentworth Miller as Dr. Adam Lockwood. The special effects aren't bad, but they don't really add much to the story, and it is not really gripping or interesting to be honest, it just seems too much to be copying the gun play and fighting style of The Matrix, so not the most original stuff. Adequate!",Underworld
8,ccthemovieman-1,The Premise Was Better Than The Actuality,4,7 July 2006,"A vampires versus werewolves story sounded like fun, especially with the pretty Kate Bekinsdale starring. However, I was disappointed with this overall. Beckinsdale frowned the entire movie, trying to act tough all the time. Why do these pretty young women try to act like men? She is not likable in here, nor is anyone else. It would have been nice to have someone to root for! There also is - no surprise - too much violence and bloodshed. It's not ""Van Helsing"" in that regard (overdone action) but it isn't far removed. This is a long, grim story.On the plus side, the special-effects are good and there are some interesting twists in the end regarding some of the good and the bad characters.",Underworld
9,Tweekums,A decent update of the Vampire/Werewolf mythology,7,10 July 2016,"As this film opens we are told that a war once raged between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) but six hundred years ago the Vampires killed Lucian, the leader of the Lycans and the war was over; since then the Vampires have been mopping up what was left of the Lycans. Then during one such operation Selene, one of the Vampires, senses that a nest of Lycans contains far more than had been seen in centuries. Her leader, Kraven, is dubious but she is convinced and investigates what the Lycans were doing. She is surprised to see they appear to be following a specific human; Michael Corvin.It turns out the he is a direct decedent of the ancestor of both Vampires and Lycans and could potentially become a hybrid of both! The Vampires are determined to kill him but Selene isn't so sure. As time passes she learns that much of what she has been told is untrue and if she is to survive she will have to battle both Lycans and Vampires.This is a decent fantasy adventure; they is lots of action throughout and an interesting story. The setting is dark and moody which gives the film a good feel; this is added to by the fact that the characters seem to have a thing about wearing black. This is especially true of Kate Beckinsale who looks fantastic in tight black PVC; she isn't just there for her looks though; she does a fine job in the role. She is ably supported by Michael Sheen as Lucian and Bill Nighy as Viktor, the most powerful of the Vampires. Scott Speedman is slightly less impressive as Michael but that could be seen as a deliberate attempt to make the human character less of a presence than the supernatural creatures. The action is directed stylishly and nicely updates the vampire/werewolf mythology with modern weapons used to fire special bullets that play on each creatures traditional weaknesses. Overall a solid enough film that fans of the genre are likely to enjoy.",Underworld

Well worth seeing.",Underworld
11,BA_Harrison,"Slick, undemanding fun.",7,30 January 2009,"A comic-book style monster flick designed to appeal to goths, teens, teen-goths, and middle-aged men (my demographic!) who like hot young women in figure-hugging rubber outfits, Underworld squeezes sexy Kate Beckinsale into a shiny black costume, equips her with some serious firepower (a pair of hand cannons almost as big as she is) and sends her out hunting werewolves. The result is a slick piece of mainstream horror that, despite lacking any really effective scares or a genuine sense of excitement, still offers enough fun to make it worth a watch.Beckinsale plays Selene, a beautiful vampire warrior embroiled in a centuries-long conflict against a race of werewolves known as 'lycans'. Driven by a desire for revenge against the creatures that she believes slaughtered her family, Selene has dedicated her life to destroying the lycan, but after rescuing a human from an attack by her hairy foes, the sexy bloodsucker discovers that all is not as it appears to be between the two races...Director Len Wiseman's cast are all ridiculously attractive and impossibly cool, sporting the the latest in Gothic chic; the blue-tinted, rain-drenched cinematography is far more impressive than the rather forgettable plot; and nobody does anything without looking great whilst doing it. However, although Underworld is undoubtedly a case of style over content, it still manages to be pretty entertaining.The script, by Wiseman and Kevin Grevioux, writes its own rules and includes such inventive gimmicks as ultraviolet and silver-nitrate bullets (for use against vampire and lycan respectively); there are some very impressive CGI werewolf transformations; the wonderful Bill Nighy gives a terrific performance as head vampire Viktor; and lots of noisy shootouts and fights (during which Selene never seems to be in any real danger) mean that things rarely get dull.Films like Underworld won't change the face of horror cinema, but at least they're enjoyable for the duration.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Underworld
12,Coventry,Burn your money instead of giving it to this !!!,2,25 October 2003,"Ugh...I've seen this movie in the cinema yesterday and I still feel dirty. The first thing that went through my mind when the end credits rolled was: suckfest !! I'll stick to that thought...TOTAL suckfest !
You have to know, I'm a real sucker for werewolves and I've been waiting since so long for a new good movie about them reaches the theaters. Ginger Snaps and Dog Soldiers were decent films but they never made it to the big screen ( at least not here ). So, Underworld contains the first cinema-werewolves since ages but it's pure crap. The best way to describe Underworld is : Blade meets The Matrix with a slice of The Hulk near the end. In other words, this means : too loud, way too much over the top and far from original ( although it pretends to be very original ). I may be a very old-fashioned person when it comes to matters like this but in my humble opinion werewolves and vampires are ancient, mythical creatures with a long history behind them already. Showing these icons as futuristic, multi-armed warriors is despicable and can be described by one single word : BLASPHEMY !!I guess we can point our finger to ""director"" Len Wiseman...Not in ONE part of this movie, this guy proves that he surpasses the level of an average videoclip director. The entire finished product looks like a publicity stunt for MTV or something and above that, Wiseman seems to be proud of that. Oh well, I guess he was to busy thinking about going to bed with Kate Beckinsale instead of filming a good movie. Speaking of which, I honestly have to say I never heard of Kate before this film. That's not a surprise actually, since she starred in Pearl Harbor before this and I'm trying to avoid that movie as much as I'm trying to avoid Leprosy ! The rest of the cast is not worth a mention...I only liked Lucian ( the über-Lycan ) up till a certain level.I'm really annoyed by the plot idea of this movie. In case you don't know: Underworld tells the story of a war that is going on between Vampires and Werewolves for centuries already. Although Wiseman claims it to be creative and innovating, it falls into the same old cliché ***SPOILERS*** the origin of the war was a passionate matter ***END SPOILER**** ... I hate people who claim to be original while they're in fact telling the same old story in another form ! And here's another provoking aspect : why are, during the whole movie, werewolves shown as the inferior species ?? Correct me if I'm wrong, but in this movie the vampires are merely shown as lazy and irritating creatures while the ""lycans"" are far more motivated and dedicated ! Is it because the star herself is a bloodsucker, perhaps ?
No, all together, it may look promising and fascinating if you're a 13 year old pimpled horror freak with giant braces in your mouth ( no offense if you are, by the way ) but if you're a bit of a traditional horror fan, this movie will leave you behind with an empty feeling.",Underworld
13,michaelRokeefe,Vampires! Werewolves! Vicious and ravenous.,6,10 May 2005,"For centuries vampires and werewolves have engaged in nocturnal battles. Each generation of the races grow stronger and more determined to annihilate the other. Emotions and the will to live are tested when a beautiful female vampire named Selene(Kate Beckinsale), who is famous and revered for her hunting prowess, falls in love with a peace-loving werewolf, Michael(Scott Speedman). This underworld pair would love to see an abrupt end to the fighting-to-the-death battles.The special visual effects are stupendous. The whole mood is dark and dank. More than enough gore and violence to restrict younger viewers. Beckinsale is super fine as the vampire warrior. I wish she would have been this aggressive in VAN HELSING(2004). Also in the cast are: Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy and Shane Brolly. My favorite scene is in the finale when a head is sliced off diagonally. This should be rated G for Gothic gore. A must see for vampire and werewolf fans.",Underworld

15,Hey_Sweden,Shows its audience a reasonably good time.,6,7 October 2017,"Out of the blue, a hunky average-Joe hospital intern named Michael (Scott Speedman) is targeted by beings who turn out to be ""Lycans"", or werewolves. It turns out that there's been a war waging between Vampires and Lycans for centuries, and Michael's caught up in it because the Lycans have taken a keen interest in him. The Vampire who begins protecting Michael on a regular basis is the tough-as-nails Selene (a black leather clad, super sexy Kate Beckinsale). She also must deal with the traitorous Kraven (Shane Brolly) and Lycan head honcho Lucian (Michael Sheen).Admittedly, some of the gadgets here are cool. Each side has devised special bullets guaranteed to mess up opponents badly. Director Len Wiseman serves up a lot of fast and furious action, and the kind of rapid cutting common to so many modern films of this kind. Beckinsale looks exquisite while kicking ass, and Speedman is sure to get plenty of hearts fluttering himself. All of that said, it's hard to care very much about the characters for quite a while, until Wiseman starts giving the actors more dramatic moments. Even then, the film looks and feels drab, with characters struggling to keep their emotions in check. The heavy reliance on digital technology, unfortunately, turns too many of the effects into cartoons. (Not that this is surprising; ""Underworld"" was obviously done to have a comic book sort of approach.) The werewolves, in particular, look pretty bad. This is dark, rainy stuff with atmosphere to spare (this was filmed in Hungary), slick to a fault, but never very involving. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the ""things are not as they seem"" plot twist, although some viewers may charge that they saw it coming well ahead of time.Beckinsale and Speedman are nicely supported by a talented bunch of actors. Sheen is charismatic, Bill Nighy has excellent screen presence as head Vampire Viktor, and Sophia Myles has plenty of sex appeal herself in the role of Erika. Brolly isn't so hot, however; his reaction to hearing some ""shocking"" news is priceless.Screenplay by actor Danny McBride, with story credit going to McBride, fellow actor Kevin Grevioux (both of them also have roles in the film), and director Wiseman.Followed by three more ""Underworld"" features.Six out of 10.",Underworld
16,preppy-3,A GREAT horror film,10,3 October 2003,"Vampires vs. werewolves. Sexy vampire woman (Kate Beckinsale) saves a muscular good-looking human (Scott Speedman) who is being chased by the werewolves. But why?There's a LOT more going on there but I'll let you find out for yourself. Basically this movie is VERY loud, full of ferocious gun fights (don't ask me why the wolves and vampires fight it out with guns--it just works and Beckinsale looks GREAT firing off a gun in each hand), washed out color, dark atmospheric sets, tons of fog, loud music on the soundtrack, plenty of blood, a very deep plot (for a horror film), some scary looking werewolves that can run along the walls and ceilings (!!!) and all done at a breathless pace. The damned movie only stops occasionally for the plot and then zips ahead full speed.The acting doesn't really matter--this movie is all about violence and visuals. That being said, Beckinsale (and the other vampires) look great in leather and I LOVE the long leather coats they wear when going to battle. Speedman is bad but, seriously, the poor guy has NOTHING to work with! The only other notable is Shane Brolly who basically sneers his way through his role...but it works.Next to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" this is one of the best horror films released this year. It looks like a masterpiece compared to crap like ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Cold Creek Manor"". Also there's a thankful lack of humor and camp in this film. It takes everything dead serious and plows ahead. I sat there totally engrossed during the entire film and grinning like an idiot because it was so GOOD! Basically a must-see for all horror fans.Also there's a set-up for a sequel...let's hope that DOESN'T happen. No horror film has ever had a good sequel.",Underworld
17,poolandrews,"Good but not great, I much prefer the sequel.",6,26 November 2006,"Underworld tells the tale of a race of Werewolves known as the Lychans & a race of Vampires know as, well Vampires & the war that has raged between the two for centuries. The Vampire race has vowed to track down every Werewolf & wipe them out, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is what's know as a deathdealer, one such Vampire who goes around killing Werewolves, it's a living I suppose. However she is suspicious that something big is going down in the Werewolf world, they seem to be after a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who happens to have special blood because of someone who he is a descendant of, or something like that. The Werewolf leader Lucien (Michael Sheen) wants Michael's blood to genetically create a Vampire Werewolf cross which will be stronger than either a Vampire or Werewolf for reasons I can't be bothered to go into. It's up to the PVC clad Selene to save the day...This American, German, English & Hungarian co-production was directed by Len Wiseman & I thought it was a decent film although I got the impression that I'd seen it all before & it never quite got me going. I should say at this point that there appears to be two versions of Underworld in distribution, the original theatrical cut & a director's cut & to be honest I don't know which one I saw but it felt way too long either way. The script by Danny McBride is far too drawn out & takes all sorts of ideas & themes from other (much better) films like Blade (1998) & The Matrix (1999) in particular. One big problem I have with Underworld is it's length, at just over 2 hours for the theatrical version & significantly over 2 hours for the director's cut I found myself drifting away & losing interest at various stages as I don't think there's enough going on to sustain one's interest for a couple of hours plus. The basic story is thin to say the least as it mixes the usual traditional Vampire/Werewolf film-lore together with ultra modern up-to-date elements like genetics, hi-tech weaponry & fast cars. It's a fairly good mix to be honest & the film is a good watch but just too long. The plot tries to throw in a couple of twists & turns but I found it all pretty straight forward & a tad predictable. The character's are OK but nothing special & I found the constant comic book type dialogue annoying & repetitive after a while, overall I'd say Underworld is a good film for sure but nothing spectacular.Director Wiseman does a neat job on Underworld although one felt he was more interested on the visual side of it rather than the storyline, he bleaches almost all the colour out of the picture & there were a few moments where it looked liked he shot it in black and white. There's plenty of The Matrix style fights with people performing impossible leaps, lots of people firing cool looking guns in slow-motion & the like, to be honest none of the action scenes are particularly memorable & I found scenes of people firing guns at each other in slow-motion started to become dull well before the end. The film looks great being set within a cool comic book style industrial, Gothic, dark rain soaked world where everyone dresses in fetishistic rubber, PVC, leather & lace. The violence & gore was disappointing, apart from someone having their head sliced in half & some blood splatter there is actually very little of the red stuff present.With a modest sounding $22,000,000 budget Underworld looks more expensive than that, it's a stylish & well made film for sure but again it's nothing we haven't seen before. The special effects are pretty good, both physical & CGI. A special mention for Mrs Beckinsale who looks really hot in her PVC outfit, to be honest I reckon she's worth the price of admission on her own as she kicks & shoots her way through the film, hey I'm easily pleased...Underworld is a good film & one well worth watching if only for Beckinsale in PVC, however I felt it was too long, when you pick the bones from it there's not really much to it & it should have been more violent. Followed by the even better & totally brilliant Underworld: Evolution (2006) which I much prefer to this & the IMDb lists Untitled Underworld Prequel (2009) which I presume hasn't even started shooting yet.",Underworld

True, it isn't the most original concept and we have oft seen similar styles of treatment of ancient rivalries, but Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are engaging enough in this tale of vampires v werewolves.

Yes, I wanted to see Kate Beckinsale. I was thinking about seeing Vacancy and wanted to know if she was worth the price of admission. I was also interested in the comments regarding her doing nudity. Is that her nude in Uncovered or is it a body double? Only the cameraman knows for sure. But that is off topic. This is about Underworld. But, maybe it is on topic, since I would not have watched had I not wanted to see her. She was hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! All covered up and I couldn't take my eyes off her.What was the movie about?

20,zardoz-13,"""Underworld"" is still a good horror thriller that you can sink your fangs into and enjoy for its vitality.",8,29 July 2007,"Synthesize elements from famous film franchises like ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade"" to forge a bullet-riddled, revisionist vampires-vs.-werewolves urban war epic, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect from the exciting, new, fantasy chiller ""Underworld"" starring ""Pearl Harbor"" beauty Kate Beckinsale. This supercharged but synthetic British horror thriller with R-rated heaps of blood & gore and a touch of Shakespeare plays fast and loose with vampire lore. Not only do the vamps refrain from shape shifting into bats, but also these pale-faced bloodsuckers can stare at their reflections in the mirror! Were that not enough these fangsters don't have to shack up for the day in their caskets. On the other hand, rookie director Len Wiseman and stuntman-turned-scenarist Danny McBride adhere to the lycanthrope legend with no radical departures. Action-packed from the outset, this darkly-lensed, tragic melodrama laid in a rain swept contemporary setting provides enough different things along the way with a couple of major plot revelations to boost ""Underworld"" above its formulaic origins. For example, the vampires load their automatic weapons with silver nitrate slugs, while the werewolves pack cartridges filled with ultra-violet light to literally let daylight through their sworn enemies. The special effects sequences that depict the transformation from man into werewolf look cool, and the sight of these scary creatures hauling butt on the walls in pursuit of their prey make for memorable images. One especially clever scene shows a werewolf as he uses his bodily powers to pop the bullets out of his wounds.Although it runs a little over two hours, ""Underworld"" maintains enough momentum in its melodramatic narrative and features strong enough villains that it entertains you without giving you nightmares. Surprisingly, though it looks like it should have descended from a graphic novel, ""Underworld"" boasts no previous source material aside from an original story penned by black stuntman-turned-actor Kevin Grevioux, former ""Stargate"" art director Wiseman, and McBride himself. When the bullets aren't thudding noisily in your ears, ""Underworld"" features a deafening, industrial-strength, orchestral soundtrack written by ex-Tangerine Dreamer Paul Haslinger with songs written by David Bowie and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciate.Kate Beckinsale plays a leather-clad vampire warrior named Selene who cannot kill enough werewolves to satisfy her thirst for revenge. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a no-holds-barred war from centuries, and the vampires finally appear to have gotten the upper hand over the Lycans. According to Selene, these hideous Lycans wiped out her entire family and would have killed her too had it not been for vampire elder Viktor (Bill Nighy of ""Hitler's S.S.: Portrait in Evil"") who saved her life and turned her into a vampire. Meanwhile, as Viktor rests in his tomb, his hand-picked protégé Craven (Shane Brolly of ""Impostor"") appears to have turned traitor to his own kind. Secretly, Kraven has been negotiating a truce behind the scenes with the Lycans who are trying to develop a serum which will enable Lycans and vampires to mate. Naturally, when Selene awakens Viktor and reveals Kraven's insidious plot, all hell breaks loose. Furthermore, it doesn't help matters that the apparently whipped Lycans are far from whipped as Selene learns in an opening shoot-out in a subway tunnel. No, human society doesn't know about the millennium war happening right under their noses, because the vampires and werewolves conceal themselves so well. In fact, the vampires maintain their own blood bank, so they don't have to bleed humans dry. Once a rebellious Selene resurrects Viktor to punish the treacherous Kraven, the action really slams into high gear. Despite Kraven's assurances to the contrary that the werewolves have been eliminated as a threat, Selene sets out to convince Viktor that the werewolves are staging a comeback. Nothing can stop our hardnosed heroine from proving her point, even if she must turn against her own breed. Apparently, the Lycans have found a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman of ""Duets"") who can assimilate both vampire and werewolf DNA so as to reproduce. Complications arise when Michael saves Selene's life, and she finds herself attracted to him. In ""Underworld,""Director Len Wiseman, who served as art director not only on the theatrical ""Stargate"" but also ""Independence Day,"" makes the most of his threadbare $20-million production so that ""Underworld"" can compete with the films that inspired it. Set amid gloomy, Gothic castles where the elitist vampires huddle in their fight against evil, ""Underworld"" stresses adrenaline-laced action with just enough time out for the exposition to keep audiences on track about who's who. While the characters aren't as substantial as they could be, each shows a different side as the plot approaches its climax. Selene changes from a mindless werewolf killer from the get-go when she learns the truth about her family and the heroic vampire who saved her from sure death. Tucked away in the flashbacks is another story that revolves around the villainous Viktor that explains his hatred of all things Lycan.Surprisingly, for a British-produced movie, ""Underworld"" ignores sex, nudity, and romance in favor of bloodletting and mutilation. Although it cannot compare with ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld""manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production. The fact that the Brits were able to produce their own variation on these popular, special effects laden spectacles is reason enough to watch it. Unfortunately, like the vampires here who refuse to countenance interspecies breeding, nearly 90 per cent of American film critics have staked out this well-made thriller because they feel it offers nothing new and lacks the polished production values of those other film franchises. Truth is that getting a large scale action film like ""Underworld"" made in England by Englishmen amounts to something like a miracle. While it doesn't look as polished as ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld"" is still a good horror thriller that you can sink your teeth into and enjoy for its vitality.",Underworld
21,Boba_Fett1138,A good looking- and good enough movie.,6,13 January 2006,"The movie is wonderfully made and has a perfectly, moody dark atmosphere. The visual effects are convincing enough and there are some nicely shot action sequences. Still the movie is not as good as it could had been, especially when considering what its concept is.Problem with the movie is that it isn't really an entertaining one to watch. The movie could had really used some humor at times and the story and the movie in general, takes itself way too serious. It makes the movie a bit heavy and hard one to watch at times and because of this all the movie doesn't really have an high entertainment value. Another thing is that the story becomes unnecessary hard to follow at times, because of the very same reason. The movie is not halve as entertaining as it could had been. The concept of the movie; Werewolves versus vampires sounds good but the execution of it is done too seriously. It's done with style certainly but not with a sense for entertainment. The result is a good looking- but mostly empty movie that isn't really always constantly pleasant to watch.The movie also lacks some real likable characters. Seline is a cool chick but I don't have the feeling that we ever fully get to know and understand her. Also there is absolutely no chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, which makes parts of the movie weak at times.The acting is fair enough. The actors fit their roles well and that is what really counts. Bill Nighy is always great to watch in a movie and this one is no exception. He plays the best part of the movie, a sort of über-vampire.It certainly is a watchable movie, especially to those who also liked the first two Blade movies. I'll probably also watch its sequel ""Underworld: Evolution"" but probably not earlier until when it arrives on DVD.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Underworld
22,Calicodreamin,Selene!,9,3 May 2020,"Kate Beckinsale owns this character, from the costumes to the acting to the down right badass action. The storyline is well developed, adding a sophisticated side to the werewolf v. vampire concept. The cinematography is dark and beautiful, the characters well cast and well acted, and the action down right cool. Can't ask for much more. Love this series!",Underworld
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Better than I expected, but considering how low my expectations were...",6,2 June 2004,"Back when I first saw the trailers for this film, I immediately thought; ""Oh. Another cheap rip-off of The Matrix... and it seems like they stuck some Blade and The Crow in there, too, for good measure."" I was fairly surprised when I saw it, but it didn't really show me something that fascinated me, like The Matrix and its sequels did. The action in it is reasonably good, but several of the scenes were confusingly filmed; you couldn't really keep track of where the different characters are at any point, except for when they're on screen together. The action also almost only consists of shooting guns, which really doesn't get a lot of results in the film; I found it to be far more exciting in the rare situations where the Lycans were transformed and fighting the Vampires. The very last fight scene in the film was also great, very intense and unpredictable. The special effects in the film are very well-made, both the CGI and in general the creature effects look very good. The film somehow seemed to focus more on the plot than the action or the effects, which is a pretty big mistake with a film like this; first of all, it's a film made in a time where this sort of film is made to be bigger and better than the last, which mainly refers to action and/or special effects, second, the story isn't that great nor very original. I think they overrated how good the story is, not to mention all the unexplained new things they introduce to the concepts of Vampires and Lycans. I do think the story was fairly interesting, and it is somewhat original(I guess). I think one of the things that annoyed me the most was that a lot of the time, I wasn't entirely sure who were the Lycans and who were the Vampires, since they basically look the same, in their human form. The plot is OK, reasonably original, but the film makes a mistake in making it so plot driven instead of focusing on at least a little more action. The acting is mostly decent, no fantastic performances, but what can you expect from a movie like this. The characters are hard to comment on, since just about everyone apart from the two main characters either are jerks from the beginning, or turn out to be jerks somewhere in the film. The cinematography is nothing special, at times it's even very bad. I have to congratulate the crew on what a good job they did on the creature effects; just before writing this review, I found out that nearly no CGI effects were used at all. That's very impressive, considering how good the creatures look. Great job on that. All in all, the film does look like a rip-off, but only on the outside. On closer inspection, the film does have a few original thoughts in it. I recommend it to fans of dark, gothic films, containing some action and special effects, with a decent plot. Don't expect to see loads of great action sequences, or huge effect-filled scenes. Don't expect a great plot. Actually, about the action, if you've seen the trailer, maybe you shouldn't even bother seeing the film, because most of the good action sequences are shown there anyway. Only watch this if you *really* love this type of films. 6/10",Underworld
24,view_and_review,Good Mix of Story and Action,7,10 January 2017,"Just watched Underworld: Blood Wars in the theater and it made me want to review the 14 year run of Underworlds that began in 2003 (wow that seems so long ago). So, I forked over some money to Amazon to watch the first Underworld. It's amazing how much I'd forgotten. I think I watched mindlessly the first time because I missed so much of the story line.This was the genesis hence it requires a certain level of adoration. I think the sequels are actually better (which is a rarity for franchises) but this movie started it all. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) simply wants to be a warrior--""death dealer""--for her species against the Lycans. It's this dedication that led her to unveil a lot more than she'd bargained for.The movie is high powered, fast-moving, and dark. Sure, Vampires are allergic to sunlight but that doesn't mean that the sun never rises! The entire movie takes place at night to the degree you'd think it was one long continuous night. Even with that the lighting is good enough to distinguish what's going on and there is no strain on the eyes.Underworld was an excellent mix of good story with action. It was a lot more to it than I remembered and I'm glad I watched it again.",Underworld
25,Uriah43,An Enjoyable Action Film,7,27 September 2012,"For many centuries the vampires and werewolves (lycans) have been at war. The powerful werewolf leader, Lucian (played by Michael Sheen), is believed to be dead and the vampires conclude that the war has been successfully won. Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a member of the vampire warrior caste known as ""Death Dealers"", suspects otherwise and just happens to observe lycans mysteriously following a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). A gun battle between the lycans and the Death Dealers takes place with casualties sustained by both sides. It is at this time that the vampires discover that the lycans are using special radioactive bullets which can kill them. To even the odds the vampires make bullets containing silver nitrate which can also kill the lycans. Meanwhile, the vampire named Kraven (played by Shane Brolly), has a secret and is planning to betray his coven right before they can institute an important change of leadership ceremony. Anyway, having established the basic foundation of the film I would like to say that it had more depth than I thought it would. The director (Len Wiseman) did a splendid job setting the dark and dreary mood that was just right for this particular movie. Kate Beckinsale looked awesome and played her part very well. I also thought Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill Nighy (playing the vampire ""Viktor"") also turned in good performances. On the flip side though, I didn't especially care for the effort by Scott Speedman who seemed out of his league in comparison to others around him. The special effects were plentiful and if you like CGI then you will probably appreciate this film. In closing, this was an enjoyable action film and I recommend it to anybody who likes this type of movie in general or Kate Beckinsale in particular.",Underworld
26,movieman_kev,I wish I could Lycan this to a good film,4,14 June 2012,"Amidst a generations old war between vampires and were-wolfs, Selene (Kate Bekensale, ""Haunted"", ""Uncovered""), a sexy vamp, finds herself inexplicably romantically drawn to lycanthrope, Michael, whom she saves despite facing the ire of her own kind, and whom might just have the key to finally eat this decades long feud.An exercise in style over substance, this overly long, overtly (almost to the point of clownishly) melodramatic piece of fantasy action assembly-line product looks good but all is for naught as it lacks any kind of heart (or indeed brain). I truly tried to watch this flick with an open mind and choose to give it the benefit of the doubt. My friend loves this franchise, alas I had to come to the uncomforting conclusion that his taste in films is quite suspect to say the least. My Grade: D+",Underworld
27,Aaron1375,Gothic tale of the war between vampires and werewolves.,8,23 June 2007,"Rather good and sleek action/horror hybrid in the same vein as a Blade, though not quite up to that movie. The action is good, and the scenery is good to as the city setting seems very other worldly, a Gothic mixture of old and new. The story, there has been an ages old feud between werewolves and vampires, the vampires apparently winning as they are slowly but surely wiping the wolves out. However, there seems to be a new target of the wolves, a young doctor whose blood the wolves want for reasons that are not immediately clear. So there ya have it, throw in a lot of gun fire and some latex and you have your movie. There are problems with the film though as there are a lot of double crosses and I am still not one hundred percent clear as to what made the doctor dude so important. Still, there is plenty of action to watch and lots of blood too. It was funny seeing how the werewolves were a bit rough and the vampires looked like aristocrats. It was a bit hard to pull for either side until the end when all the motivations were on the table too, as neither side seemed really to be making a target of humans. So all in all a good action/horror flick.",Underworld
28,The_Void,Entertaining action fare...,8,18 January 2006,"Vampires and werewolves in a Romero and Juliet style story? When you think about it, Underworld really should have been great; but despite being disappointing on the whole, special effects guru turned director Len Wiseman has still managed to turn out a good film. In fact, he's done quite well; as when you consider that Underworld is a story of a century old war, a love story, a Matrix-style actioner and sees the creation of a 'new' monster, it could have been a hell of a lot messier than it is. It's clear that Wiseman thinks this movie is better than it is, as it constantly takes itself too seriously and the frequent attempts at storytelling try to hard to create a story around the vampires and werewolves; but on the other hand, the mythology is well done and I'd rather Underworld be too serious than a complete joke. The plot, as mentioned, follows a war between vampires and werewolves. It's been going on for ages, but there's been a new development in the form of Michael; a 'carrier' who could become the link between the two warring sides.Visually, the film looks great. It can be said that it looks a lot like a music video, but the slick dark visuals bode very well with the action set pieces, and music video or not; at least the style suits the film. The star of the show is very much Kate Beckinsale. I like her anyway, but she looks far hotter in this movie than in any others I've seen her in previously or since. The movie makes the best of having this fine lady wearing a tight cat suit and long leather coat, and although it does this so much that a lack of other ideas becomes obvious; I really aren't complaining. The rest of the cast is mostly made up long haired, ""European"" men, with only Bill Nighy standing out among them in his role as a vampire elder. The action set pieces are way over the top, yet always entertaining, and since vampires and werewolves don't really exist...they can be forgiven for going overboard. The special effects are pretty good too, considering they're CGI. They're almost always shown in darkness...but I prefer dark and good, to clear and rubbish. On the whole, this really isn't great. The romance is hardly touched on, there's better action in The Matrix and it's a little messy; but I really enjoyed it, Kate Beckinsale is awesome and it's entertaining on the whole.",Underworld
29,trashgang,take me to the underworld,8,15 October 2008,"The Matrix (1999) spawned a new genre. A genre when action is taken place all is shown in slo-mo. Also when people are fighting or doing their things the Japanese wire-effect is used. The Matrix stood on his own but 2003 brought The Matrix Revolutions and Reloaded but also a lot of flicks based on those effects. Underworld followed the same tradition and brought something new to the horror genre. By doing that it had his pro's and contra's but I was taken by the throat.I had seen it in 2003 but nowadays with the Blu Ray relaeses I saw it again and reviewed it again. I loved it because I was hooked on the story and on the suspense build in Underworld. But also on the sublime acting of Victor (Bill Nighy) and Lucian (Michael Sheen). I really loved them and the way Lucian was played was really welldone. Michael moved further to the stupid and ridiculous teenage vampire saga , Twilight, but again I really loved his performance there as Aro.Selene (Kate Bekinsale) looked gorgeous and indeed reminded you the most towards Neo in The Matrix. She played well too but I wasn't really into her. She was a bit the underdog. Still, not that all into CGI I never had any problem with the lycans coming alive. Full CGI but still they add the real red stuff in it when they attack the vampires. The script itself is just as simple as it can get. Vampires are living among humans, some are Death Dealers like Selene. They only have one reason why they are Death Dealers, to destroy the lycans. It's going on for ages until Lucian has interest in a human. It's for Selena to search it out why and she come across a revelation of lies. Once that happens the movie really becomes enjoyable. Len Wiseman did an excellent job as director. He did Underworld Evoltion (2006) to move further to Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and the remake of Total Recall (2012).If you are into vampires and werewolves and can dig a twist to the world they are living in than pick this up, excellent.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Underworld

The Vampire Colony is being threatened by the Lycan gang of Werewolves and the Vampire's are being led by the red hot looking Kat Beckinsole (Selene) who is really a rebel among her group and breaks all the rules of her blood sucking family. Selene even gets interested in a werewolf and decides not to bite his neck but does a good job of french kissing him to death. There is plenty of bullets flying all around and Selene manages to upset quite a few big brothers and werewolves and puts a ring right through their very noses.

32,JamesHitchcock,This whole City-of-Dreadful-Night thing is becoming a cliché,3,4 December 2006,"""Underworld"" (and I am not making this up) is about a war between werewolves and vampires. Apparently, the two species have been at war for many centuries, but the vampires have been getting the better of it ever since about five hundred years ago they won a great victory and killed the werewolf leader Lucian. The result is that nowadays vampires live in elegant Gothic mansions whereas the werewolves (or Lycans- presumably a contraction of ""lycanthropes""- as they are referred to) have to lead an underground existence in the sewers.That, at least, is the basic premise of the film. I had always thought that vampires killed their enemies by sucking their blood and that they could in turn only be killed by a stake though the heart, but in this film they (and their Lycan enemies) have obviously acquired the benefits of modern technology because both sides go into battle with all guns blazing. Apparently they have to use some rather specialised ammunition, but the net result is that the film's action sequences look more like something out of ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" than ""Dracula"". Although the Lycans retain the power to transform themselves into wolf-like monsters, the vampires have also ditched many of their other traditional attributes. They do not, for example, sleep in coffins during daylight hours (not that they need to, because it always seems to be night-time during this film), or waste much time trying to avoid crucifixes and garlic. They don't even seem to do much bloodsucking.The plot is fairly (make that extremely) confusing. Indeed, at times it seems that the plot is only an excuse upon which to hang some highly extended battle sequences. At its heart, however, seems to be a sort of Romeo and Juliet tale about Selene, a beautiful vampire girl, and her love for Michael, a werewolf boy. Except that Michael isn't really a werewolf, but a human unwillingly converted to lycanthropy after being bitten. Except that he isn't really a normal human, but someone who (if he traces his family tree back enough) has for distant cousins the Lycans on one side and the vampires on the other. Which makes his blood very useful as part of some nefarious scheme the Lycans have cooked up. Or something like that.Mixed in with this is a plot line seemingly borrowed from a Cold War spy thriller. Kraven, one of the vampire leaders, is secretly a double agent, in league with Lucian (who, it seems, faked his own death) in order to help him carry out the aforesaid nefarious scheme, so it falls to Selene, as a sort of vampirical James Bond, to try and thwart him. Or something like that.The film is set in an unnamed city (actually shot in Budapest) and has the sort of moody, Gothic look- all darkness and rainswept, deserted city streets- which a generation ago would have been acclaimed as highly original. Ever since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" in 1982, however, this whole City-of-Dreadful-Night look has become a cliché. Think, for example, of the various ""Batman"" films. (Interestingly enough, when Scott's brother Tony made an urban vampire story, ""The Hunger"", the year after ""Blade Runner"", he deliberately avoided this look in favour of something light and airy). In ""Underworld"" Len Wiseman takes the dark, moody look to extremes- the colour scheme is so dominated by blacks, greys and dark blues that it might as well have been made in monochrome.The best thing that this film has going for it is the looks of Kate Beckinsale in her tight leather catsuit. Unfortunately, the film does not really show off Miss Beckinsale's acting talents in the same way as it shows off her figure. She made a great start to her film career as a delightful and unaffected Hero in Kenneth Branagh's wonderful version of ""Much Ado about Nothing"", but in recent years she has made some rather odd career choices (that stuffed turkey ""Pearl Harbour"" being another). None of the other actors make their characters come to life; indeed, this is the sort of film where characterisation comes well down the list of the filmmakers' priorities (noisy and violent action being at the top). I note that there are a number of threads on the IMDb message board asking whether viewers side with the vampires or the Lycans. Who cares? As Henry Kissinger is alleged to have said of the Iran-Iraq war: it's a pity they can't both lose. 3/10",Underworld

34,MovieAddict2016,"Interesting racial undertones evoking the Civil War era, some good special effects, and some OK fight sequences make ""Underworld"" a decent Friday night matinee...",6,27 January 2004,"It was only a matter of time before a film like this was made. Unfortunately, the end result isn't quite as amazing as everyone had hoped it would be.Nevertheless, if you like werewolves and vampires, then ""Underworld"" will probably wet your teeth. For the most part, I found the film an enjoyable enough experience to recommend--although there are some scenes that seem to slow the film down and add nothing to the story. I was also disappointed in the way that the film pays more attention on keeping its vampires and werewolves in human form, talking for the duration of the film, rarely fighting and evolving into beasts of the night. As Homer Simpson once said, ""Less yakkin'; more zappin'!""""Underworld"" is about a vampire named Selene (Kate Beckinsale) who lives in a scary mansion in Europe with dozens of other gothic beasts like herself. They're so busy fighting werewolves, it made me wonder where they all get their stylish leather attire--it's like a ""Grease"" reunion or something.Selene is a ""hunter""--she seeks out werewolves and slaughters them, and this happens in the opening sequence which is pretty ""Matrix""-esque. The vampires fight them with silver bullets, and the werewolves fight vampires with big teeth. Not much of a challenge for the vampires, eh? You'd be surprised. With the help of CGI, Selene has trouble fighting the animals. (They are apparently pretty strong, and apparently a big rip-off of the creatures from ""An American Werewolf in Europe"" and ""Paris."")Werewolves, we learn, used to be slaves to the vampire species, before Lucius--the head of the werewolves--fell in love with the vampire ""lord's"" daughter. The latter was killed, and the former escaped, only to form a pack of followers that would battle with vampires over the ages.Now Lucius has targeted a young doctor who has the capability of forming a hybrid between vampires and werewolves. I didn't understand everything regarding how, exactly, this is possible, since I think the explanation is purposefully quick and slurred so that audiences can't stop to evaluate any implausabilities.Selene falls in love with the man and tries to stop Viktor, the lord of the vampires, from killing him. He tells her that the doctor is an abomination--that vampires and werewolves cannot be mixed together. She doesn't believe him.The film is basically politically-correct. Werewolves used to be slaves, freed themselves, and were still faced with racism until a lone vampire decided that the two species could unite. Doesn't that sound a bit like truth? Regardless of any implied backdrops, the film will probably satisfy any action fan who is looking for some neat battle sequences and cool special effects.My only problem with the film is probably the fact that the vampires and werewolves never really evolve into vampires or werewolves. We do see some large dogs occasionally, but for the most part it's just people with glowing eyes battling big muscular people who sometimes rip off their clothes and turn into big hairy beasts.But the film is an enjoyable Friday night matineee; a good movie if you're in the mood for something light and enjoyable. It rips of ""The Matrix"" a bit with its style, but what gothic action film hasn't since 1999? Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous here, and worth the price of admission alone. The film isn't too original, and it's not nearly as great as it could have been (chances are ruined here), but it works as a dumb, fun movie.3/5 stars.John Ulmer",Underworld

The thing is the movie just wasn't executed all that well. Although the plot is about a war between vampires and werewolves in modern time. It just wasn't exciting or as entertaining as it should be, despite the stylish action sequences. On the plus side it launched Kate Beckinsale career, I didn't even notice her in other movies until this one. She is perfect for this role as a vampire in tight leather wielding duel pistols. The movie is fast paced but the problem is, it just didn't seem fast paced despite all the vampire and werewolves action and cool cinematography. Maybe if it had more cool special moves like the part were the main protagonist Selene shoots through the ground to escape which I was sold for when I saw it in the trailer. The movie didn't lack in the action department just lacked in the ""that is freakin awesome"" action aspect. Anyways didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining and despite everything that is suppose to be cool happening on screen it was boring.

37,thesar-2,Under the One,4,18 January 2012,"I can't put my finger on why I was so bored during 'Underworld' (2½/5 Stars). Sure, there's a lot going on, a lot of pretty good FX – EXCEPT for the laughable werewolves (I refuse to call them the 'L' word; call them what they are!) – and mystery aplenty, but I've always been left unsatisfied with this movie. For one, I do like Vampire stories (again, EXCEPT the faux pas vampire story in 'Twilight') but I like the werewolf lore more. This one was supposed to be a blending of both, but get real; this is a 70/30 Vampire/Werewolf story. I guess that might be a good thing considering how horrid the CGI werewolves look. Anyways, the movie's real highlight is the extremely strong character, Selene, played with an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale. Without her, I doubt I'd have much interest in continuing with the series. The movie obviously directly steals from 'The Matrix' and that's a huge deterrent, as is the constant bending-the-rules for plot development and weighs more heavily on the ""mystery"" of the war between the beasts than character development. It also screams sequel – literally. Unless you name your movie ""Episode #"" then it shouldn't be so blatant. Barely recommended.",Underworld
38,cherold,"wants to be great, settles for mediocre",5,30 June 2005,"With its leather-wearing heroine and eternal, blue-filtered night, it's obvious that Underwold is desperate to be cool. Sadly, desperate and cool never go together. Cool movies are those where the director wants to say something in an interesting way, and is enamored of a certain slick style. It's not that cool movies aren't consciously cool, but that they are interested in more than *just* being cool. In the Matrix, the directors were desperate to be profound and say something about the human condition, whereas Tarentino's films are informed by his desire to keep himself amused. Not that I'm a fan of Tarentino by any means, but in his glib way he does have a sense of cool.But Underworld is just an empty vehicle for slick posturing. It's not just that the movie has nothing profound to say (The Matrix only wanted to be profound, it didn't actually succeed), it's that the movie has nothing to say at all. It exists entirely as a vehicle for the lovely and talented Kate Beckinsale to posture and snarl some forgettable dialog. Even the film's somewhat interesting revelation in the last quarter feels not like a result of deep conviction but simply like something clever the script could toss in.While the movie is weak in almost everything, it has a workmanlike competence that keeps it watchable. You never connect with the characters, you are never enthralled by the story and the fight scenes aren't especially good, but nothing is really bad enough to stop watching, and the movie is a perfectly acceptable way to kill a couple of hours.But what it is not is cool.",Underworld

40,Robert_duder,The only unique Vampire/Werewolf film ever made...and brilliant at that,7,7 February 2006,"Underworld is indeed a gem. It takes a deadly overused concept and finally comes out with something actually unique with an outstanding cast and concept, great story (if not a little complex) and definite future for turning it into a mega-franchise. Where to begin...Director and co-writer Len Wiseman puts everything together exactly the way a person would want to see it. Action, drama, romance, intensity and vampire and werewolves all round it out but none of it is horror...it's solid action.Kate Beckinsale leads the cast as Selene, the vampire Death dealer who hunts Lycans (Werewolves) in an attempt to exact vengeance for the murder of her mortal family centuries ago. Selene is one of the best action movie heroes ever...period. Beckinsale is dark and beautiful and deadly all at once and she has awesome screen presence. She does an A+ job. Lead actor opposite her is Scott Speedman. I don't think he has near the screen presence of Beckinsale or any of the other cast members but he's adequate and he's fortunate enough to have the rest of the cast be so good that he sort of fits in. The plus side is there is some chemistry between him and Beckinsale, it's not quite as passionate as you would hope for but there is some. Shane Brolly plays Kraven, the villain vampire who is working with the Lycans to bring about the integration of their species basically creating an up-stoppable race of half vampire, half lycan. He's quite brutal in his role and definitely a great bad guy. He doesn't stand a chance against Selene and is put in his place more than once but he's still a good bad guy. Bill Nighy stands out as Viktor, one of the eldest vampires who is in hibernation awaiting his time to rule until Selene resurrects him to gain his support against Kraven. He's an even better bad guy, and a great vampire. Believable in his role and he goes from being weakened and sickly to being a powerful force. His death is one of the coolest...and also laughable moments in cinema history...or action films any ways. Michael Sheen as the leader of the Lycans Lucian. Lucian is almost an anti-hero and he opens up the door for much more of a back story. His role is well done and he adds class to the cast. They are of course many other actors who support the cast and they all do a great job respectfully as either Vampires or Lycans. The Special effects in Underworld are slightly minimal compared to other films of this caliber which is not a bad thing whatsoever, it simply means that the cast must actually work harder to make their roles believable and they do flawlessly. I must admit, after seeing this film again for the second time, and now I have seen the sequel, the story line to this one is a bit complex and you really have to follow it closely to figure out who is who and where the story is going. I'm thinking there is some sort of plot hole going from the first to second film but I can't say for sure and I can't think of anything off hand. If nothing else it means the film is very intelligent for a mainstream action film. I think the series will really show it's strength in a trilogy perhaps. It reminded me a lot of the Matrix series except it didn't start to suck after the first one.Underworld is a must see film for action lovers or anyone who loves a good vampire story because it is very unique. The Vampires aren't evil...some of the usual rules apply to them...but they aren't preying on humans, in fact they have a personal pact to feed on livestock and cloned blood. It's the uncontrollable Lycans who pose a threat and the war rages with guns and hand to hand battles and coming up with new weapons to keep the other immortal team dead. Amidst this is betrayal, romance, and a history that only begins to unfold. You can't help but feel there is so much more to this story. Len Wiseman has created something very interesting here and definitely worth checking out. It's a brilliant story with a brilliant cast and it gets more brilliant with time. 7.5/10",Underworld
41,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Reverses the usual 'Hollywood' gender roles, but conforms to its genre in pretty much every other way.",6,30 August 2018,"'Underworld (2003)' reverses the usual 'Hollywood' gender roles in a relatively refreshing way, so it's a shame that it also conforms to the tropes of its genre in pretty much every other area, to the point that it's predictable essentially down to the letter and that some of its more extraneous plot elements feel as though they were included out of a false sense of necessity rather than out of a legitimate narrative need. Its tight, black leather aesthetic is very telling of the time in which it was made, a time when such faux 'gothic' stylings were considered 'outsider' and 'cool'. It permeates the entire piece to the point that it all feels fairly dated, though this 'sleek' style is so all-encompassing that it sort of becomes a signifier for the heightened reality of the flick itself - something that can be accepted almost as readily as its vampiric conceits - as opposed to a statement of its actual visual quality. There's enjoyment, albeit 'turn your brain off' and quite silly enjoyment, to be had during some of the action sequences and, even, some of the more high-strung melodrama. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I don't think it was ever trying to be. It's a decently enjoyable film when it's underway. 6/10",Underworld
42,bowmanblue,The dark side of Twilight,10,22 February 2015,"There was a time (somewhere before 2008 I believe) where if you mentioned vampires fighting werewolves, you would instantly think of the Underworld saga. Sadly, vampires started to twinkle and werewolves used to run around topless and Selene and her Underworld buddies were forced to take a backseat.However, if you're bored of vampires gazing at each other longingly and only breathing through their noses, then you may still enjoy watching the two undead races slug it out with guns. Think 'Resident Evil' only darker and better.Underworld tells the story of a vampire assassin (or 'Death Dealer' as they're called) who, during her war with the werewolves (or 'lycans' to use the technical term) falls in love with a human who may just be destined to play a bigger part in both races' lives.It's dark like The Crow, has fight scenes like 'The Matrix' and, if you're a guy, Kate Beckinsale running around in skintight rubber. If any of that sounds like you're cup of tea, then you'll probably enjoy Underworld. Amazingly, two decent sequels were also spawned off the back of this (and a fourth instalment that can be taken or left, depending on taste). Either way, give it a go - it's what vampires and werewolves were supposed to be before they used to go to high school together.",Underworld
43,ThomasDrufke,Yikes,4,28 December 2016,"There's guilty pleasure movies, and then there's the garbage like Underworld that take themselves way too seriously in an attempt to make silly action fun. What could pass as an entertaining and visually dazzling cable watch ends up as a confusing romp of a fantasy adventure.I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale. I think when she's used right, she's of immense value to any film she's a part of. Take Love & Friendship from earlier this year for example; she was given a solid script and the room to use her British wit & charm in a rewarding performance. Sure she's gorgeous to look at in Underworld, but I can't help but think that the writing didn't allow her to truly show her chops. With that said, her ability is clearly superior to the awful supporting cast. Some of the supporting performances (Shane Brolly) are disappointingly off-putting.Much like a ton of early 2000's action films, Underworld suffers from trying to emulate The Matrix too much. It's always raining, the action scenes are darkly lit, and the characters are in a constant slow motion gaze during the shootouts and fights. I can't necessarily blame Underworld for having bad action, it was simply a product of its time. In fact, there are some good looking stunts here, most of them in camera as well. That's when Underworld is at its most appealing.When Underworld takes itself too seriously and the story is bogged down by exposition scenes (that actually make the film more confusing) it's no fun. The reason I went back and began the franchise this many years later is because I was hoping to have a fun franchise to go to the theaters for in a few weeks with Blood Wars being released. Whether I stick with the franchise or not, I'm not sure.

I saw this only mere weeks after I saw the Twilight films so I was expecting the same. Well, this movie is so much different. There is so much violence and action here. The love story appears to be the back story.This takes place during a centuries old war between Lycans which are werewolves and vampires. This movie tells a love story between a vampire Selene and a hybrid in Michael.The acting is pretty good. Kate Beckinsale in a leather suit is definitely good to look at.

I liked seeing the stunts and moves that Kate Beckinsale had done as the assassin but I think she should've been better if she did those stunts in a better movie that needs saving like Assassin's Creed movie that came out this year and ended up terrible! I am not too happy about the length of the film either, I think it would better if it was just an hour and thirty minutes because I found that some of the scenes were dragging on and like it seemed some of the scenes needed to be cut but overall it was OK. However, I am giving this 7/10 because I found it lacked a bit of the Gothic side.",Underworld
46,CuriosityKilledShawn,Give me Blade anyday!,1,6 March 2004,"Take Blade and add most of The Crow and The Matrix and you have this. The latter two I didn't particularly enjoy and Underworld was just as dull and messy as the trailer made it out to be.Amidst a clutter of cliched sets, impossible to differentiate from each other, and heavily overused lightning and rain (I'm sure there are OTHER ways of creating a gothic atmosphere) an uninteresting and meandering plot slowly fizzles to life. Apparently Vampires and Werewolves have been fighting for years but a couple of them want the war to end. But with no indication of who is good and bad and the lack of a clearly defined hero there's no way to engage with the characters and no reason to care what happens to them.The SFX are of the jumping thru the air in slow motion while spinning and shooting and doing the laundry variety. Nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. It wasn't interesting the first hundred times I saw it and this movie is no exception.As you might expect from a movie of this sort, the music is nothing but someone murdering a thrash metal guitar. It's just noise and chaos that matches the incoherent blur onscreen. Many elements of this film lead to exciting possibilities but they've all been thrown away in favor of easy trash. Technically efficient it may well be but Underworld is a failure on every other level.And what's with the title. At no point in the entire movie is there interaction with the 'real' world. Just a load of running around in sewers and darkly lit mansion corridors. The sense of having an insight into a world that is not meant to be seen by human eyes is non-existent. Even the kidnapped human acts as if the discovery of Vampires and Werewolves is nothing to out of the ordinary.Highlyclichedlookinggothicmovieworld would have been a more appropriate title.The one star is purely for Kate Beckinsdale in a leather outfit.I have the DTS Region 3 edition of this movie.

It's got some great action bits, memorable characters, and it moves along at a great clip, what's the problem you ask? well I just feel it wasn't as good as it could have been. I've always loved the idea of Vampires Vs Werewolves and this movie was just brimming with it, I just felt disappointed by it all. The finale is a memorable one, with a great showdown between Viktor|Nighy| and Selene|Beckinsale|. The gore level is pretty decent, with some nice effects, and not an abundant amount of CGI like I expected.Performances. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous to look at, and makes for a great anti heroine. She's got the right amount of emotions, the kick ass attitude, and the proper attire to look right. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael, but not as refined as he is in the sequel. Michael Sheen is intense as Lucian, I dug him. Shane Brolly played a great, yet intense weasel. Bill Nighy stole a lot of the scenes he was in, with his frighteningly intimidating performance. His scenes with Beckinsale were endearing.Bottom line. Underworld is a decent way to pass the time, but It's not as good as it should have been.

48,Bored_Dragon,Underworld Franchise (2003-2016),7,14 December 2019,"Still a better love story than Twilight :DSet (predominantly) in the present day, this fantasy franchise tells us of a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves. We follow the story from the perspective of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), one of the greatest vampire warriors, who leads the werewolf hunt. When she meets Michael (Scott Speedman), a man who is persecuted by werewolves for a mysterious reason, her life and worldviews change drastically. This saga has quite a well-crafted story and characterization, though as the franchise goes on, the quality of the story declines to eventually turn into a shallow action. The acting, the camera, the directing, the effects, the music ... it's all pretty well done, but nothing spectacular.Underworld (2003)The first film introduces us to the dark world of vampires and werewolves, which secretly coexists with ours. While vampires are a well-organized society with a powerful army, werewolves are a wild unleashed horde that is gradually exterminated by vampires. And then emerges a leader capable of uniting werewolves, as well as a man capable of uniting the features of both races in one hybrid being. A good thriller with a story that will intrigue you, and with just the right amount of romance and well-directed action.7/10Underworld: Evolution (2006)""Evolution"" continues directly to the first movie and now Selene and Michael are trying to break into the history and secrets of both races, in a desperate attempt to bring the centuries-old war to an end. A worthy sequel in the same manner and quality as the first film.7/10Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009)""Rise of the Lycans"" is an ""origins story"" and takes us into the Middle Ages. Vampires were aristocracy, and werewolves were their slaves, until the young werewolf Lucian rose into a leader who led his race in the struggle for liberation, thus beginning a centuries-old war between the two races. The franchise still holds a level.7/10Underworld: Awakening (2012)Humans discover the existence of vampires and werewolves and decide to exterminate them. Michael and Selene are hit while fighting humans and she wakes up twelve years later, not knowing what happened to Michael. She now has a twelve-year-old daughter, the first natural-born hybrid, who she must protect from Lycans that want to take advantage of her in their fight for dominance.The fourth film is slightly weaker than its predecessors. The action continues in the same manner, but the story is underdeveloped. I was under the impression that I was watching a long movie trailer, not the movie itself. But basically, I liked it.6,5/10Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)The latest installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. ""Blood Wars"" rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.5/10",Underworld
49,tabuno,A Decent if not Spectacular Horror Movie,7,25 January 2019,"22 September 2003. I can't say that Underworld was spectacular. It did make use of the latest special effects, slow-mo action moves from other contemporary action films (notably Matrix). It did have a decent script and a reasonable, consistent storyline that was intelligent. Yet I didn't find the movie really breaking any new, innovative ground, except for the fusion of vampires and werewolves (an intriguing idea done well). The acting was decent, if not superlative. There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth to many of the lead characters.Interestingly, this horror movie didn't really spin the way most horror movies go and the Romeo and Juliet spin-off went a lot more American than the English version. I enjoyed the movie, but the action scenes seemed less than explosively dramatic and exciting than say for example Charlies' Angels. The horror wasn't as terrifying as for example 28 Days or The Ring.This blending or fusion of genres makes for a more modest accomplishment, a more cerebral effort towards horror that produces one small step for vampires and werewolves, a giant step for a future movie.

50,The-Sarkologist,"Not the most enthralling film out there, but not bad either",6,7 January 2012,"I'm not really sure of what I make of this film. It is not a bad film, but it is not one that is absolutely fantastic either. It is not a boring film, but it is not riveting either. To me it seemed to be a standard Hollywood style good guy verse bad guy, with a few twists and turns thrown in. Maybe it is because it is a vampire vs werewolf film and that I have found very few such films out there that have been all that exciting. In another sense I must say that vampires and werewolves do bore me though.The film is about a vampire warrior who is in the front line of a war between the vampires and the werewolves, however most of the vampires believe that the war is long over and have fallen into decadence in the decades since the final battle had been fought. However, our hero stumbles upon a plot which involves creating a hybrid vampire/werewolf, something that the vampires find rather offensive.Vampires and werewolves have a long history in our culture. While we can point to Dracula as being the beginning of the modern vampire story, werewolves have no such starting point. Some have suggested that the idea goes back to the Greco-Roman world where people were turned into wolves, however this is not the modern concept of Lycanthropy (the mythical diseases that causes people to become werewolves) and further these metamorphoses were not limited to people turning into wolves (Ovid's Metamorphosis is the best ancient text for these myths as pretty much all of the main characters turn into something else). The other thing with Greco-roman metamorphosis is that they generally do not turn back to humans. Once they have changed, they have changed for good.For some reason Vampires and Werewolves have always seemed to go together, but maybe because that has something to do with our legends. We do have ghosts and faeries, but they do not seem to come into the same category (though a horror film using faeries would be decent in my opinion, and I know that there is literature out there that uses this concept). I also notice that Vampires and Werewolves are one of the staples of modern horror films (but then again so are brain eating zombies).Look, I did actually like this film, but it is not something that I would put into the category of films like Twelve Monkeys and Edward Scissorhands. This film is entertainment, though I would not consider it horror (mind you, I would not consider many films that use the title horror as actually being horror) because I doubt it is supposed to create fear in the eyes of the viewer. Gothic I would because it is set in a dark and grizzly world. Oh, I also liked the idea that the Vampires were very high-tech while the Werewolves tended to be a little more backward. I note that the vampires' lair had a lot of high tech gadgetry, but the werewolves' lair seemed to be something that hearkens back to the 60s.",Underworld

'Underworld' is an action-packed, visually stunning spectacle!As mentioned in my 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' review, it is best to view 'Rise' first, and then 'Underworld' - although 'Underworld' was the first film in the series. It makes more sense, since you will now have a much better background on Lucian. Lucian is the leader of the werewolves, and the antagonist (he was the protagonist in 'Rise of the Lycans').Centuries after Lucian became the Werewolf (Lycan) leader, the feud between vampires and werewolves still rages on. Lucian is trying to join vampire and werewolf blood to create a super species, but he needs the blood of a human, Michael Corvino, who is the direct descendent of the vampire/werewolf ancestor.'Underworld' features excellent performances from a very good cast - especially Bill Nighy as Viktor, and Kate Beckinsale as Selene. The make-up and visual effects are fantastic. There's loads of action, and incredible chase sequences, with stunning photography. This truly is a perfectly polished production. There never really is a dull moment - considering the film runs 132 minutes (I watched the extended version).This is non-stop action and entertainment from beginning to end.

And yet there is something that floats over the whole thing, that survives the animal horror that animates these pictures and bleak places. Two species have been fighting for centuries and the salvation of both is in a new blood line that will cross the two different ones. Peace can only come from crossing the bloodlines of the two rivals, the two enemies, the two antagons. And that works, in the film of course, because in reality if it were that simple! It has been noticed that when a civil war starts we never know when it will stop. It took some thirty years for the latest episode of the Irish civil war to come to maybe an end and that was only the last episode of a war that was started by the invasion and conquest of Ireland by the English three or four centuries ago. And I will not speak of the Bosnian or Kosovar conflicts, nor of the opposition between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq and in the world. But that's the optimistic final scene of a film that targets teenagers when war comes to an end because the two bloodlines have been mixed in the veins of a new leader. Yet I found the film a little bit long and repetitive as for the fighting scenes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Underworld

57,johnnyboyz,"Vampires for the 21st Century, but there's not an awful lot going on here besides this.",5,28 March 2009,"Underworld is the horror film for the YouTube generation. It presents two of Universal's many classical horror monsters from yester-decade and updates them for the contemporary age that is the 21st Century. Similary to the following year's Van Helsing and to quite some similar failings, Underworld presents vampires and werewolves, not as subjects of horror designed to frighten, but as action heroes fighting one another in a picture that is more akin to a war film than it is most anything else. The hybridity of the genres and general updating does not stop there, for at its centre is a strong female hero, a bringing into the 21st century for both species and an essence of noir for good measure.The most interesting thing about Underworld is its study of post-modern (indeed, post-classical) vampires and how now, they are all techno-literate beings whom dress in the latest fashion and carry on with a certain legacy of looking smart and always trying to remain one-up on their enemies. While all around contemporary Hollywood over the last few years, different directors explore their chosen 'types' of vampires, Len Wiseman purely updates and shifts into the 21st Century. Some examples I'm thinking of are Robert Rodriguez' Hispanic vampires in From Dusk Till Dawn; the African-American half-vampire lead in the Blade films and a more obscure example in 2001 film The Forsaken, in which you had to believe a group of relatively harmless looking bunch of teen vampires were on the brink of world domination. These ideas have continued on with films like Twilight, which places a romantic spin on the character.Wiseman has taken what it was for a character to be a vampire and has purely transformed them for now: cloaks into PVC, Gothic bookcases and books into laptops and computers and has gifted them with an array of firearms. On the other hand, the werewolves or 'lycans' in this film are grotty and dirty. They inhabit grungy and filthy locations and seem to have none of the advanced ways of living their counterparts have, if the vampires are sexy then the Lycans are just plain ugly. They are additionally evil and sadistic in their procedures, taking blood from people that really don't want to be there.Underworld takes place in an odd Eastern European/United States hybrid of a location and sees its female lead, named Selene (Beckinsale), go through a number of motions before she comes across a certain human named Michael Corvin (Speedman), someone whom the Lycans have targeted as part of their plans. Following Michael being bitten and Selene's determination to save him, a love story begins to bloom. The love story between two rivalling factions makes me think of Romeo and Juliet, but in another one of Wiseman's twisting of classical conventions, one agent of the party is a member of the 'enemy' against his will.Alas, all the glory within this film lies in its ideas and its here we remember that the film is a bit of a dead zone, offering murky and somewhat camp entertainment (especially when Bill Nighy turns up) at the best of times. Wiseman has a strong, female lead at the centre of his film but the director conflicts his interests in the shooting of her, that being he does so in a manner in which she's rendered an object. Underworld begins in a relatively ominous fashion with the set up to do with the Lycans trying to find a descendant of a certain someone and the fact they've developed a weapon that can kill vampires a lot more efficiently than anything else that has previously been produced.The film is quite good fun for about thirty-five minutes, then the charm wears off; then we recognise the all updating of the vampire conventions, etc. and get tired of it; and then it just descends into nothing before it ends. What was quite good very quickly becomes ugly looking characters standing around explaining the plot to one another when they aren't merely grumbling their lines amidst bleak and tired looking locations. The vampires spend their spare time shooting statues in the large, Gothic manor house they inhabit purely for target practise but what happens when they decapitate all their statues? They look stern and talk in gruff and ominous tones as their leader, Viktor (Nighy), who is awoken for certain reasons, slobbers and cackles all over the place in a role that on another day you might think was a pantomime performance.What about the Lycans? Well, one Lycan towards the end can seemingly turn into a werewolf and back again at will, despite there not being any obvious evidence of a full moon and whenever they do come up against someone they don't like, they maul them in a series of close up shots of blood, biting and shards being extracted from bodies that are just grotesque and feel oddly out of place in what is a casual, '15' certificate, gloomy period drama for most of the time. I read that Wiseman did a lot of concept art and drawing for the film – it shows. What also shows is his lack of attention to everything else. He's caught the 'look' of the vampires and the cinematography is relatively good but the film's running on empty. It makes me think: what else can a film about warring vampires and werewolves be about? Well, probably not much which further begs the question 'why even bother in the first place.'",Underworld
58,filipemanuelneto,"Sex, violence, bloodlust and brutality in a film made for teenagers.",5,11 July 2020,"Vampire movies exist by the hundreds. I think there is hardly a monster capable of being more seductive and appealing than the vampire. Likewise, there is hardly a rival more suitable for those blood drinkers than the werewolf. This film will explore these and create an alternative story for both monsters that, here, have a common origin and are destined to hate each other.The main character is Selene, a warrior vampire who devoted hundreds of years to an eternal war with werewolves, called Lycans (if anyone knows the difference between a Lycan and a werewolf, please tell me). After a routine mission, she discovers that there is a large group of Lycans who can threaten vampires. Ignored by the vampire leader, she decides to prove that she is right and the danger is real, and wakes up the mighty Viktor, an elder vampire. But Selene's inquiries will prove the threat is more serious than she imagined and all loyalties, inside and outside the vampire clan, are at stake.This film is an action blockbuster loaded with leather, bullets, blood and testosterone, more than suitable for teenagers full of bouncing hormones. For me, it worked well but it is far from being something I would pay to see at the theater. It was directed by Len Wiseman, who we already know from ""Live Free or Die Hard"". He is a satisfactory director and seems to like dark material. I believe he was very inspired by ""Matrix"", if we take into account the leather clothes, hard-rock style and, above all, the opening scene in the subway, with hundreds of bullets fired without injuring anyone but destroying all the station, in a moment of unrealistic and absurd action. Believing that mortals live totally unaware to such blatant immortals is, at the very least, impossible. The story becomes more complex with the revelation of the past of the two clans and the creation of a myth that is never truly well explained, but supports the rest of the film.The cast is full of well-known names and is led by Kate Beckinsale, in a role that places her, more or less, between a Lara Kroft and a porn dominatrix. She's attractive but doesn't give us much more than her own body and a hot voice. Scott Speedman is stupid and doesn't seem to know how he got here, besides there is no chemistry between him and Beckinsale for both of them to be a credible romantic couple. Shane Brolly is fine, but not extraordinary and there are a lot of actors who only show up a little without adding some significant to the film, such as Wentworth Miller, Kevin Grevioux and Sophia Myles (she seems to have been included in the cast just to please the male audience who prefers a blonde over a brunette). But not everything is so decadent! Michael Sheen is excellent, being the most outstanding actor in the film and the one that gives us more solid work. Although I prefer to see him in dramatic films like ""Frost/Nixon"" or ""The Queen"", he is good at this kind of character and would come, years after this film, to do something like this when he play Aro Volturi in ""Twillight"" saga. Likewise, we must see and applaud Bill Nighy's good work, with his unique voice and diction. He gave his character an air of elegant aristocratic sadism.Technically, it is a dark film, loaded with action, bullets, leather, blood and very dark. Without a single scene with the sun or some bright colour, it is truly a dark film... I already said that? Gothic to the core, it has a nebulous and gloomy cinematography that, however, works well. Not being a romantic film, it has some hot scenes that, however, show nothing much. Even Beckinsale's ass always looks in her tights. However, sex is everywhere in the vampire world and that vampire mansion looks almost like a decadent brothel. The scenes of violence are also everywhere, but they sound so fake that even when a head is cut in half, we don't feel anything about it.",Underworld

61,TheMovieDiorama,Underworld is the female equivalent of 'Blade'.,6,13 March 2018,"Whether you view that as pleasant or hideous is up to you, I for one believe it to be a refreshing change despite being released during the height of the 'Blade' franchise. The vampiric Death Dealer Selene is in the midst of an eternal war, Lycans against vampires. Convinced that these werewolves murdered her family, she's hellbent on destroying the Lycans to save her covenant. It's a complicated family tree with deathly descendants and plenty of double-crossing, which does make for an interesting story. McBride's screenplay turns traditional monsters into a gritty gang war whilst embedding genetics along the way. It feels fresh, even when watching it today, just a shame that McBride's script is littered with thin characterisation and plagued with bland dialogue. Several scenes where I became disengaged just because of how tedious the story was told. Takes itself far too seriously with all the mumbo jumbo about the Corvin bloodline, lycans, vampi...yawwwn...see what I mean? What Underworld does do well is world building. The bleak underground environment and stormy weathering creates a gothic atmosphere that would suit the accompaniment of an Evanescence soundtrack (hold onto that thought...). The production and visual designs were a dark delight and certainly assisted in enhancing the world it was portraying. Acting was functional, aside from Nighy and Sheen who gave great performances, everyone else just walked around in the darkness shooting at each other. Beckinsale definitely catapulted herself into stardom though, and clearly liked wearing leather attire ever since. The minimal use of CGI was appreciated and the final act was excitingly directed by Wiseman. It is plagued with generic sound effects, y'know the ones you could find in any horror or gothic video game, which does infuriate me slightly as it just urges me to play 'Devil May Cry' again. However, Underworld is a thinly written promising start at blending action and horror together. The question is can it maintain this level of interest? Well, you'll see...",Underworld

63,Fella_shibby,Solid Gothic action flick about vampires n werewolves.,9,19 February 2017,"I saw this first in a theatre in 2003. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - Kate Beckinsale is a vampire looking incredibly hot in ridiculously tight leather matrix style clothes whose job it is to eliminate the werewolves as part of the centuries old war between the two species. Her acting is good too. Things change when Beckinsale tries to protect a human, Speedman who is targetted by the werewolves for some reasons. The movie has a distinctively Gothic look, with great attention given to the backdrop. Every inch of the cinematography is polished. The architecture and costumes are true fashion statements. This world is so dense with aggressiveness it is almost surreal. Borrowing from The Matrix and Blade, the director Len Wiseman made Underworld more of a goth action flick n less of a vampire/werewolf. Nonetheless pretty enjoyable action flick. Was happy that none of those hand held shaky cam stuff was added.",Underworld
64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Cool concept and stylish directing salvage a weak screenplay,6,6 April 2008,"Anyone with a love or soft spot for creature-driven sci-fi/fantasy can appreciate what the writing trio led by Len Wiseman attempted to do when they conceived ""Underworld."" Creating a world where vampires and werewolves (Lycans) live amongst humans and are engaged in a secret thousand-year-old war is at the least interesting and respectable for fans of the like and so conceptually, ""Underworld"" at least has something to work with. Putting their vision on the big screen? Not as easy. The film is riddled with bad dialogue, bad acting and scenes that seem to lack any kind of contextual clues--not to mention bullets, lots of bullets.""Underworld"" stars Kate Beckinsale as a ""death dealer,"" named Selene--you know, that troubled, martial arts-savvy vampire charged with the responsibility to perpetuate the violence between vampires and lycans by killing lycans and never questions it until, of course, the film is about twenty minutes in. The rich history the writers have concocted makes it a bit more interesting, but it would be nicer to see it than have characters waste time telling us about it through dialogue with other characters. Selene begins to question these things when she catches on to a vampire/lycan conspiracy hundreds of years in the making and tries to uncover the mystery and how a human being hunted by lycans named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) is tied to it all.The film foremost but least obviously dodges the obstacle of explaining how vampires and lycans can wage their war without humans knowing. It gives no time (assumed the future, but who knows) or place explanation. In fact, daylight never happens in the film, it's all about the vampires and lycans. There is also nothing done to really get the viewer to grasp the conflict. You start to pick sides in your head as to who is right or wrong, but you never once feel the conflict through any of the characters and Selene seems to be a very odd and unmotivated heroine. All you get is one scene highly reminiscent of ""Silence of the Lambs"" of her telling her story to Michael and at that point it's too late for it to make a serious impact on the movie.The acting is mostly bland, but that could be more due to a horrible script. The script wouldn't have been half as bad if it spent less time explaining. Bill Nighy is the exception to the poor acting as vampire lord Viktor who Selene awakens in a desperate attempt to figure out what's going on. Nighy brings some actual character to his role and some serious evil. His performance was no doubt that which landed him his role as Davy Jones in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films.The directing and art direction does offer this film a visual saving grace. Wiseman does some really cool transitions and some strange, but cool-looking action sequences. The film does seem to not-so-obviously cover its budget constraints in this manner, however, in that the best visual effects are in short snippets. Also, either they were steering away from anything that was going to garner an R-rating or they simply didn't have the money to show most of the violence, something that would have made the film feel a bit more real. Lycans go to maul people and Wiseman cuts away, leaving you doubting if the person actually got mauled.Basically, if I weren't a sucker for films with a mythology placed in a futuristic sci-fi setting with similar art direction, this film would have been horrendous. Viewers with a genuine interest in story like that and sci-fi action sequences are sure to at least get a bit of entertainment out of ""Underworld,"" but that's about all this film has to offer.",Underworld
65,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Your incompetence is becoming most taxing""",7,26 January 2009,"Kate Beckinsale in Underworld is a clear inspiration taken from recent vampire/goth/sci fi movies, particularly the Blade and Matrix series, and the audience will surely be making comparisons, even subconsciously. She embodies the sleek, ass-kicking skills of Trinity from The Matrix but her vampire element reminds me more of the surprisingly effective performance that Parker Posey gave in Blade 3. You see, Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire who has devoted her existence to destroying ""lycans,"" the werewolves who have sleeked up their image for the 21st century by removing the 'thrope' from the end of their title. It seems that the vampires and the lycans have been involved in a raging war with each other for well over 1,000 years, which prompted me to wonder what the average kill rate is for a vampire or lycan soldier. Either they breed really really fast or they're just not very good warriors.At any rate, Selene stumbles across a conspiracy involving the leader of the lycans, Lucian, and the leader of the vampires, Kraven, to combine the blood of the two species and create a new breed of nightwalker that would be more powerful than both. Vampires and werewolves are incompatible even at the cellular level (even their blood fights when combined), but Selene still fears that Kraven's and Lucian's plot would endanger the vampires, so she awakens their dark lord from a mummified hibernation a full century ahead of schedule.The intricacies of the plot, however, are noticeably more complex than the material can sustain. There are three rulers of the vampires, and at any given time there is one awake and ruling and two in hibernation. Selene's waking of Viktor 100 years early is a sacred violation that hasn't been broken in 1,400 years. She needs to find get conclusive proof of this dark conspiracy or even Viktor would be powerless to save her from a most vicious punishment.I missed the part, by the way, where they explained why Viktor couldn't be put back to sleep after having woken up, but no matter. He's awake now and his gradual transformation from a mummy into a cadaverous vampire leader is one of the more interesting make-up effects in the movie.The special effects, by the way, are the thing that will make or break the movie. It's dark and dreary from beginning to end, which is not unexpected in a film about a war between werewolves and vampires, but the darkness gets a little repetitive long before the end of the movie. Upon wakening, Viktor finds himself in the middle of a situation in which this vampire woman has broken a 1,000 year old tradition to report to him a virtually impossible conspiracy, even while she is falling in love with a lycan-infected human named Michael, which is strictly forbidden (it's forbidden because he's a lycan, by the way, not because his name is Michael).Scott Speedman is given remarkably little to do in the entire film, although the transformation of his character provides for what is by far the film's best battle scene. The soundtrack is loud and violent, like much of the rest of the movie, and while it manages to avoid adding much to the vampire or werewolf genres despite having combined them together so well, there are some interesting ways that the movie brings the story into the 21st century. Not only do these ancient creatures now have cell-phones, but high-powered handguns that fire liquid-silver and phosphorescent bullets. They have, it seems, ""harnessed sunlight as a weapon.""With these kinds of things going on, you might expect a better movie, but it's fast and brutal and stylish and ends with the promise of a sequel in which everything that we have come to learn from this movie will be completely changed. And for something that could so easily have been written off as a Blade or Matrix rip-off at the time of its release, that's a pretty successful outcome.",Underworld
66,FiendishDramaturgy,Underworld. A new legend is born.,10,19 September 2003,"Let me start this review by saying that, while this work is NOT scary, it was not MEANT to be scary. This production was classed into the genre of ""Horror,"" strictly due to the ""monster"" factor. There are ""tense"" moments, to be sure, but this is not a ""boo!"" kind of movie. There is; however, plenty of action, lots of well enacted drama and wonderful realistic effects. I was actually amazed with the apparent lack of high-dollar effects, the almost Rice-ian Vampire clans lounging in the well designed lush and lavish ""mansion,"" the gritty tension held throughout the movie, and the stunningly clever costume designs. But what held me mostly in thrall were the effects.The effects were so well done, they were believable. They explain that the older Lycan can change at will, regardless of the moon's cycle...with that in mind, the way the werewolves' mandible bones FORCED themselves out and into place was dead ON. Changing at will would BE like that, especially in times of anger or great stress. Someone (possibly Wiseman?) had heard (and correctly believed) that ""less is more,"" because the effects were done in such a way as to appear REAL and not...simply more Hollywood ""Matrix"" flash. These scenes were so well done; so well directed, filmed and portrayed that we could, even if for a short time, believe the things we were watching...were possible. The wonderfully unique bullets used by both sides are absolutely brilliant. It reminded me if the horribly campy western/vampire movie made about 10 or 15 years ago entitled, ""Sundown,"" where the vampire hunters used wooden bullets.I am simply stunned to discover that this is Len Wiseman's first attempt in the field as Director. I eagerly look forward to more brilliance from this man. (He was also one of the writers of the original literary work.) If this is his first attempt, we may have just been introduced to the next Spielberg. Personally, I'm hoping he leans more towards being the next Hitchcock. The weaponry Selene (Kate Beckinsale) utilized was quite unique and completely interested the small audience in my hometown theater. When she drew her stars and threw them simultaneously at the Lycan; when the scene slowed to an almost stop just long enough to allow you to SEE the throwing stars as they CHANGED into much more deadly projectiles, was absolutely excellent. AND was also the ONLY scene in this entire movie which even remotely reminded me of ""The Matrix."" The other critics keep droning on and on with comparisons between these two movies, and frankly, I just don't see it. Also, ""Blade"" has been used as a source of comparison. The only similarities between ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"" are that Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Vampiric race of ""Pure Bloods,"" uses a sword. Oh, and there are Vampires. Those were the ONLY common points, as far as I could tell. This is an original work; not a petty rip-off or a ""jumble of other movies."" This is a very creative and unique attempt; a successful one, if you ask me. While guns were used more than I would have liked, the additional weaponry chosen for this endeavor was not your standard action-flick fare. One of the vampire ""Death Dealers"" uses a pair of 10' whips quite well. And don't forget about the bullets I mentioned...what an extraordinary intellectual and creative power. The costumes were kept simple, yet served the purpose of helping to set the mood. Two words...understated elegance. Absolutely brilliant. Some have said that the story line is hard to follow, or that there is no discernible plot. Let me be frank. This is not a movie for the squeamish, nor is it a movie for those who like to be able to NOT concentrate on the plot. Sure, there is enough visual eye candy to keep most casual fans of the genre entertained, but there is also a very complicated and beautifully sinister plot and subplots going on beneath the flying bullets and shots of Kate Beckinsale's butt in latex and leather. The Shakespearean relationship between Selene and Michael (Scott Speedman) is well written and pleasantly portrayed, in the midst of all that darkness and drama. A bit of candle-light to shine hope into the darkness of despair, as it were. The story is an upgraded spin on a timeless classic, with enough additional plot and sub-plot to keep even the most common movie-goer interested. The war between the Vampires and the Lycan has raged for more than a thousand years. The Lycan, once the serving class to the Vampire, had risen against their masters and won their freedom. But was that the real story? Was their freedom truly the motivating force which stoked the fires of this war for this long? In the center of this war are Selene (Vampire) and Michael (Lycan). Their love of one another is forbidden by every Vampire Covenant written, but will that be enough to stop them from falling in love? As one of the chosen ""Death Dealers,"" an organization within the Vampire Clans trained and equipped to hunt and kill Lycans, Selene is faced with a decision most dire: sell out and live? or be true to herself and die? Will her loyalty to her ancient maker keep her from making the right choice? And that is where the sub-plot kicks into overdrive and makes you sit back and say, ""Oh wow! No kidding?!"" at the darkling twists in the plot. I was thoroughly entertained by this work, and cannot wait to add the DVD to the Vampire section of my horror collection. Superb acting; rich depth of character; talented, creative directing; and realistic effects put this movie at the top of all other Vampyre movies, for me. It earns an ambitious 9.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",Underworld

It sort of seems like a teenage band that can't really play and compensates by hiding behind the feedback. Underworld is that type of dark, the type where it seems like its done to hide flaws rather than because it's a movie about vampires and they live for the night.Think Highlander II sort of too dark.And then I can only imagine the pitch for it. ""It's the Matrix with vampires...all the PVC and black leather you could ever want in a movie."" You know it got the green light on the PVC alone.Actually no, that's mean, Vampires V Lycans is a pretty solid idea for a plot-line. It seems like fun.The thing is, the execution failed. Any movie that relies that much on an opening narration to fill in the plot is sort of lacking. At least tie it to a montage so we don't get the feeling that Selene has the oddest thought process in the world.But otherwise, Black leather and PVC, club wear and machine guns.

When it comes to the likes of a Romeo & Juliet story presented in the genre of Fantasy/Horror, I must say that I did enjoy, for the most part, Underworld's diabolical, little tale of forbidden love.At times Underworld's vicious, blood-thirsty story of betrayal & revenge was definitely something of a gratifying adrenaline-rush where everyone (vampires and werewolves, alike) were getting royally clobbered, one and all.With its carefully-staged gun-battles literally taken (bullet-for-bullet) straight out of The Matrix, I found it somewhat unfortunate that Underworld's underworld of vampires & werewolves only came in one generic flavor - And, that was - The young & good-looking type.And besides Underworld being about 20 minutes too long for its own good, I also docked this picture some serious points due to there being way too much time spent amongst the vampires & werewolves fighting and feuding with each other.I mean, with all of the bitching, bickering and battling that went on amongst these modern-day monsters, I'm surprised that any of them had any time to feed.Underworld's budget was $22 million.

69,dfranzen70,"Dark, dark, dark!",6,1 May 2004,"It's the oldest war of them all. No, not Democrats versus Republicans, or politicians versus the truth. It's vampires versus werewolves (or Lycans, if you prefer), Evil versus evil. Or good evil versus bad evil.Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a beautiful vampire warrior who comes across a human named Michael (Scott Speedman), who's been marked by the werewolves. Why Michael? Are the Lycans planning to use him in their endless battle with the vampires? Will Michael fall for the lovely, the talented Selene? Will Selene get to kick some werewolf butt? Yes, like sand through the hourglass of time in a bottle, these are the burning questions that are thankfully answered within the first twenty minutes or so.The film is very similar to The Crow in style (and in a nod to the earlier film, Speedman's character is named Michael Corvin; the lead character in The Crow: City of Angels was named Ashe Corven); it's dark, noirish dark, foreboding dark, bad-guy dark, you name it. See, there's dark, and then there's dark dark. This is the latter. Now, the original Crow movie was wildly stylish, and Underworld carries that torch a little bit further. Not only does style triumph over substance, it body slams it to death and then dances on its grave. In other words, don't look too closely at the plot, which doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny. But that's not likely, since the film's so dark (did I mention that).As with most comic-book-atmosphere tales, this one is full of Pretty People. Even vampires and werewolves gotta look good, you know, what with the extra grooming and tooth filing and all. At any rate, there's nary an Ugly Person in sight. Even the despicable ones are Pretty People.As Selene, Kate Beckinsale is very good, appropriately slinky and pliant. Beckinsale's not known for taking on tough roles such as this - you usually see her in upper-crust films such as Emma and Cold Comfort Farm. But she acquits herself very well, so much so that there's a sequel planned for 2005.Her primary foil is Shane Brolly as Kraven, the leader of the vampires. Brolly snarls a lot, showing off what have to be more than the usual 32 teeth in the process. Brolly didn't have much in the way of facial expressions here, just you're basic ""I'm mad!"" and ""I'm madder!"" looks.Underworld is agreeably well done, with a believable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale shunted to the background.

I've heard that this movie is based on some RPG game I have never heard of and if that's true, I don't really care; this movie could probably beat the hell out of it.  ""Underworld"" really has a unique feel to it.  The story doesn't stand up well under a whole lot of thought, but that doesn't really matter.  What should really capture some people, are the special effects and the sets. There are some pretty nifty werewolf transformation scenes that certainly deserve Oscar attention.  The sets, highly Victorian as they are, also should get some props.  This movie is going to be a comic book; I can tell. It certainly has the look, feel, and story of one, yet that still doesn't make it bad.  Speaking of the story, though it isn't strong, it gets to you.  The thought that vampires and werewolves have been duking it out for thousands of years right under our noses is intriguing, even if it hasn't been fleshed out that well in the film.  Even still, it gets you thinking about everything that war means to them and us.As for the action scenes, they are certainly well shot and violent. Surprisingly, there isn't that much gore here either.

71,Chris_Docker,Beautiful execution more than compensates for derivativeness,8,20 September 2003,"'Underworld' is follows a trend of female action-hero movies, borrowing heavily from the Matrix, Blade and X-Men. What I particularly liked about this one, apart from Kate Beckinsale's fine performance (which shows that female action heroes can still be feminine), is the detailed attention given to the trappings of plot, scenery and costume. Beckinsale does most of the stunts herself, whether in tight black PVC and leather (with or without the de rigueur long black coat) or in high fashion Gothic ballgown outfits. In this world of an age-old battle between vampires and werewolves, Underworld makes up by means of great settings, scenes, respect for legend and openness to metaphor, whatever it lacks in originality, and the two species that are portrayed can easily represent any number of political or religious conflicts, though they are perhaps best explained by a clue in the website's historical 'timeline' which documents cases from Gilles de Reis right up to modern ones of schizophrenia.",Underworld

When there is action, it's of the stylized, post-'Matrix' variety, but without any of the latter's flare or drama.Like its star Kate Beckinsale, it's certainly nice to look at, but even her beauty isn't enough to put this 'Underworld' over the Top.",Underworld

Whilst this has a lot of the Matrix style choreography and impressive visuals what it doesn't have is a particularly impressive story or engaging narrative....There is a war brewing between the Lycans and the vampires and Michael (a human) is unfortunately caught up between the two rivalling factions. Ordinarily, the idea of two warring factions and one man/person being caught in the middle can present itself as being an interesting idea, but with Underworld the whole concept is so poorly conceived and developed that it gets to the point where you find yourself rather indifferent to everything.The film's true shining glory is in its style and presentation; it's clear that director Len Wiseman has watched the Matrix and other Wachowski films as his approach here feels very similar; eye-popping visuals and impressive choreography, but the narrative feels hollow and underwritten and as a story it never really engages.The performances are a mixed bag and whilst Kate Beckinsale is absolutely gorgeous she is very bland in the lead role (and it really pains me to say this as I was a big fan of her late father when he was in Porridge). Her supporting cast do fare better with the likes of Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill Nighy all of whom put in solid supporting performances.One other thing working against the film (other than Beckinsale's performance) is the unrelentingly drab and gloomy tone. The whole tone of the film is way too dark and coupled with a weak and underwritten narrative it also feels quite boring and it's fair to say that the two hour running time feels at least 50% longer than the actual run time.Underworld will undoubtedly impress younger viewers who may get taken in by the garish visuals, but for mature audiences or for anyone with half a brain the dreary tone and weak story are going to serve more as an annoyance and make one wish that they'd left the Underworld well alone.",Underworld

Acting was good by almost all the characters. Please note that this is not an ordinary horror movies with dog howls, creepy sound by doors or lightning. It's a horror movie in itself.The fight between vampires and werewolves is beautifully captured and shown.

75,dwpollar,Action-packed battle...,6,5 February 2006,"1st watched 2/5/2006, 6 out of 10(Dir-Len Wiseman): Action-packed battle from beginning to end in this initial showing of the feud between vampires & lycans(the werewolfs). Not as good as the following, but plenty to keep your interest. Despite the comic book fantasy storyline and loads of action, the director(Len Wiseman) does a good job of pulling you in by keeping your interest in the characters involved. Beckinsale & Speedman are very believable in their portrayals of the death-dealer Vampiress and the confused human in the middle of this battle. Another thing I liked about this movie is that by the end, you're not sure who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, although at the beginning the Lycans appear to be the bad folk. All in all, this is a unique twist on the horror/action genre that is well done technically and flows well with maybe a little too much gun fighting when you figure that these creatures should have more to battle with because of what they are. But definitely a tad better than the normal action movie and a nice idea that should be able to be built on in later movies, TV shows etc..",Underworld
76,NateWatchesCoolMovies,All sound and fury and not much else,7,24 March 2016,"Sometimes I think that Underworld would have made a better music video than a film. Evenescance could have wailed out a 90 minute goth number that could have just been laid in instead of audio, and it wouldn't hurt the film's narrative one bit. Indeed, you could just pop in your ear buds and and listen to whatever while you're watching it, and still pretty much know what's going on. This one is all visual flair and slick, posturing special effects that thunder along with little regard for logic, story or character development. That's not necessarily such a bad thing, as long as you know what you're going into and aren't expecting a dense, heady Bram Stoker outing. It concerns a nocturnal, bullet ridden war between vampires and lycans, known to us as werewolves. Kate Beckinsale is Selene, a front runner for the vamps, slashing and shooting her way through various stunts, shootouts and combat scenes in a swanky leather outfit. At a crucial time during the war, she falls in love with an injured lycan (Scott Speedman) and feels conflicted. As far as plot goes that's pretty much all she wrote. You're left to absorb a deafening opera of supernatural action that doesn't let up until the end. The characters tirelessly fight for a full fifteen minutes at the beginning of the movie before a single line of dialogue is even uttered. In a movie so heavily populated by sound, fury and style and so bereft of any actual weight, you better make damn sure the visual and stylistic elements deliver so you have something to keep people in their seatsThis one makes good work of that category, it's visual aesthetic a dark Poe-esque palette, the creatures and violence memorably crafted. The vampires are sullen, nihilistic brooders who sit around in cathedral esque night clubs drinking blood from flute glasses. The werewolves are virile, primal beasts, all sinew, scruff and set - demolishing physicality. It's cool stuff, if you don't examine the 'plot' too carefully and just sit back for the dreary, frenetic, super charged ride that sometimes doesn't even know itself where it's going. But it sure knows how to get there.",Underworld
77,kluseba,The most stylish action-horror movie ever made,10,27 November 2020,"I'm currently revisiting the Underworld series and have to state that the first movie has aged particuarly well. The stylish costumes still look incredibly sharp. The special effects don't look dated at all but rather have a timeless flow. The locations are perfect for an action movie with horror creatures. The lighting, sound and visual effects still offer a cinematic experience of the greatest kind. Even the nu metal soundtrack still blends in perfectly. This film represents the stylistics of its time while having achieved an outstanding legacy that has lead to the creation of four sequels so far.The story revolves around a human medical student named Michael who gets stalked, observed and attacked by a group of werewolves in a dark metro station. Vampire Selene intervenes and saves his life. She wonders why the werewolves have been following the young man while her immediate superior Kraven who fancies her is jealous of her sudden interest for a human being. Selene starts investigating on her own and saves Michael's life once more but he gets bitten by a werewolf. Despite the ongoing conflict between werewolves and vampires, Selene helps him once again as she is slowly falling in love with him. She soon discovers that Michael has a unique genetic strain that could allow him to become a vampire-werewolf hybrid. When Selene starts suspecting that Kraven is involved in a conspiracy with the pack of werewolves, she decides to awaken hibernating vampire elder Viktor who has always been a father figure for her as she seeks his advice. The growing conflicts quickly spiral out of control as Selene learns that nothing is as it appears to be.To keep it short, Underworld has stood the test of time and is one of the best action-horror movies ever made. Vampires and werewolves have never looked as stylish as in this franchise. The first entry oozes with atmosphere, convinces with a strong cast and features special effects that are still breathtaking nowadays. No matter if you are familiar with this franchise or haven't heard about it yet, now would be a good time to enjoy this timeless franchise that should immediately appeal both to fans of action and horror movies.",Underworld

79,Jonny_Numb,"after 2 strong acts, ""Underworld"" derails",6,25 September 2003,"Well, what's good about ""Underworld""?  The direction is solid, the cinematography is excellent, and the sets and costumes are well-conceived. This is basically glossy pulp that doesn't pretend to be more than it really is; filled with visual flourishes (borrowed from ""The Matrix,"" a movie I hated), it doesn't make too many worthy demands of the viewer to keep up with the story (a war between vampires and werewolves, and the possible cross-breeding of the two), which is fine by me.  The acting meets the standards of the genre, and the dialogue--as silly as it sometimes is--is kept to exposition and exclamation.  The CGI transformation effects are wisely excuted partly in shadow or darkness, making them somewhat effective. However, after the first two exceptionally strong acts (where I was fully prepared to dub this film the most fun I'd had since seeing ""Ghosts of Mars"" in the theater), ""Underworld"" devolves into a final sequence in which the film's credibility is worn thin, as vampires and werewolves run down corridors firing weapons in every direction, so much so that I found myself forgetting what their actual objective was.  Basically, the movie could've been 90 minutes and a cult masterpiece, but at two full hours, it's simply overextends its welcome.6/10",Underworld

The first in a sequence of films , that look extremely good and has so much extreme sound it bombards your eardrums. I'm a big fan of Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen and they are both good value for money as Lycan and Vampire respectively. It reminded me a little of the Blade films but maybe not quite a good.

82,Samiam3,"Occasionally clumsy, but a good source of fun-disgusting fun",7,7 November 2009,"Memorable make-up, Sensational Cinematography, Cool Costumes, and with both Werewolves and Vampires, you get two for the price of one. Now that is a pretty good deal. Underworld is not a bad directoral debut for make-up effects whiz Len Wiseman, yet the result is still missing something. The only factor that is not A+ material is the storytelling.The war between Vamps and Werewolves is one that has lasted a thousand years, Set in what looks like Central Eastern Europe, this Gothic story is about Celine, a young vampire and a skilled wolf killer. She is respected by her clan, until she breaks the laws when she partners up with Dr. Michael Corvin He has been bitten by a wolf and Celine has become aware that he might be at the centre of a conspiracy between the vamps and the wolves. The one flaw of Underworld is that it has a clumsy way of setting up conflict. Even the first scene which involves a long shoot out in the subway station is not terribly riveting because we have no idea of what is going on until long after it ends. It serves as merely eye candy, but action of epic scale should should never proceed exposition.Kate Beckinsale seems to be what the studio has used to sell the film, but in fact it is the art department, make-up effects crew, and the camera crew who make the picture come to life. Underworld is a slick flick. I guess that is all it intends to be, and if that is all you want, than you have come to the right place.",Underworld
83,davidmvining,Cool,5,10 August 2021,"This vampire and werewolf monster mashup takes itself too seriously for how silly it becomes. The performances are all over the place and the lore is overcomplicated. However, I do have a soft spot for it. Len Wiseman has a strong eye and a strong sense of action mechanics, so even if the script isn't up to the task, there's still a fair amount to enjoy. Oh, and Bill Nighy demonstrates that he's the best by acting the crap out of a silly costume and monster makeup.There's been a war between vampires and werewolves (ugh...lycans) for six hundred years ever since the lycan Lucian (Michael Sheen) was killed by Kraven (Shane Brolly). The fight continues into modern day vaguely Eastern European city where everyone speaks English all the time (Budapest, apparently). There Kate Beckinsale's Seline is a Death Dealer, a vampire on the lookout for lycans to kill in their war that seems to be winding down. Until one night when she tracks a pair of lycans who are following Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).The opening of the film is rather cool, and something I can get into. There's a voiceover from Beckinsale that explains everything (all of which we get later again, which tells me that this was added in post-production as a reaction to test screenings), but other than that it's a blue-cool series of action beats as our introduction to the world. Vampires facing off against werewolves with guns and biting. Since the film isn't really asking for emotional involvement from the audience, instead it's a window into the new world that we're about to wade into. See? There's some intelligence to this film. Not a whole lot, but some, and that's why I can't actually dislike it.The human is some kind of genetic key to the lycans who will be able to absorb the viruses from both vampires and lycans to create some kind of new race (an abomination, once vampire labels the idea) and bring justice to the vampires who subjugated them for centuries before trying to exterminate them. In the middle of this fray is Sheen as Lucian who does his best with the limited material he has. For all the issues this movie has, there are a handful of seriously talented actors at play, and Sheen is the first evidence of that. He imbues Lucian with a surprising amount of depth that the role doesn't deserve, but Sheen is a classy guy and a quality actor, and he pulls it off.The other end of this is Kraven's Shane Brolly. This guy is awful. Like, I have no idea how he got through a single audition. He's not just free from the burden of charisma, he's actively bad. Every single line delivery is cringeworthy. And he's, of course, written terribly. I mean, the guy's name is Kraven, the actor's hamming it up horribly, and the dialogue is all terrible. Yes, he's going to end up being a bad guy. Might as well have just hung a neon sign around his neck announcing it, it's that subtle. He has designs on Seline, but we all know that the story of his bravery to kill Lucian 600 years ago is going to be wrong even before we figure out who Lucian is.Where the movie also struggles is all the intrigue. There's something akin to a palace coup going on, and none of it is particularly interesting or well-explained. There are three elder vampires of a sort. Two are in hibernation, and one leads. How or why this entire system came about is completely unexplained or makes a whole lot of sense, but one rules for a hundred years, goes into hibernation, and another takes their place. At the moment, the vampires are ruled by Amelia with Marcus due to come up. Seline was turned into a vampire by Viktor, though, the third ruler due to rule after Marcus. There's real potential here for the relationship between Viktor and Seline, but he ends up introduced too late, I think. Seline, in a desperate bid to get help, awakens Viktor at about the halfway point.It feels like the emotional core of the film should have been the father/daughter relationship between Viktor and Seline. Instead, there are emotional threads going in every direction, from Kraven wanting Seline as his bride, to Seline and Michael falling for each other, to Lucian reflecting on the murder of his vampire wife which started the whole war, to even another female vampire's desires for Kraven (must be the wooden acting). There needed to be a culling of these side characters and subplots at the script stage, bringing Viktor to the beginning, and probably just axing the whole hibernation of the elders thing.Of course, the point is the action, and I like it. As I wrote before, Wiseman has a strong eye for action, and he provides fun views into the action beats that keep it all from feeling dull or incomprehensible. He varies it up as lycans change from their human form to their werewolf form to modify the fight, even giving Bill Nighy the kind of moment that sells his strength and awesomeness as he single handedly strangles a werewolf with relative ease. The action bits are where this film is at its best.Oh, and Kate Beckinsale looks really good. It helps that she's actually a perfectly fine actress and can deliver her dialogue with a modicum of conviction, which makes her scenes with Kraven kind of hilarious since Brolly is just the worst. Have I said that Brolly is hilariously bad? Because he's hilariously bad.So, this is a script that needed some work before the film went into production. As it stands, the movie's fine. I haven't seen it in years, and I ended up enjoying it more than I had expected. It's not great. It's not even really good, but it's a decent way to spend 2 hours.",Underworld
84,rosscinema,Looks good but lacks convincing story,4,7 February 2004,"A film about a war between werewolves and vampires and the leading character is a sexy female in leather? Can't go wrong can it? Well, while this can be interpreted as silly fun I still had to many problems with the story and it's lead actress. Story is of course about how there is a war on Earth (I think) between werewolves and vampires and this has been going on for many centuries. Kate Beckinsale is Selene who is a leather clad female vampire and she spends most of her time hunting down werewolves that hide inconspicuously in the human world. A young man named Michael (Scott Speedman) gets bitten by a werewolf named Lucian (Michael Sheen) and Selene notices that he was picked for a certain reason. Selene does some investigating and discovers that the werewolves are trying to mutate their species into a hybrid so that they can eliminate all vampires.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Selene takes the information back to her vampire brood but the vampire in charge Kraven (Shane Brolly) ignores her and has been acting suspiciously. The leader of their group is Viktor (Bill Nighy) who has been sleeping for many years and is not scheduled to awaken for many more but Selene does awaken him to seek help from Kraven's lack of support. Meanwhile, Michael is slowly turning into a werewolf or something like it but he and Selene have an attraction to each other. This film is directed by Len Wiseman who is making his debut here as a director and he has been primarily known as a set decorator for films like ""Stargate"". The look of this film is it's biggest asset and he gives this film a very effective gothic appeal. Every frame is shot either in doors or at night so there is no sunshine visible at all. The costumes and make-up also are some of the films highlights and Speedman's transformation is reminiscent of ""An American Werewolf in London"". Some of the problems I had with this story is the lack of information about where or when this is supposedly taking place. Is it on Earth or one of those so called alternative universes? Also, this is the first time I have ever seen werewolves able to crawl on the sides of walls like squirrels on trees. Selene is a vampire but in one scene she looks at herself in a mirror. Is she only partially a vampire? We never find out and there are other inconsistencies in this cartoonish script. While Beckinsale is adequate in the lead role I had to ask myself if the film could have benefited from another actress known for her physical attributes like Angelina Jolie or Halle Berry. I think it could and Beckinsale's lack of conviction hurts her in this role although I do understand her wanting to show the public another side of her abilities. This film is harmless and I can't argue with anyone that finds it entertaining on a comic book level but I do wish the story has been tightened up a bit and allowed the characters to engage in something resembling an intelligent conversation. Visually striking but film fails to entertain me on both levels.",Underworld
85,nycritic,Where are Bram Stoker or Bela Lugosi when you Need Them?,4,12 April 2006,"If a bad film were a misbehaving pet that had just piddled on that expensive hardwood floor you just waxed to spotless perfection, the ensuing yell of disapproval would have to be: ""Bad! Bad movie!"" This is pretty much the feeling I had in watching UNDERWORLD, a movie who was there because it existed in a list of films, positioned next to be shipped to my humble abode in Jersey City, and one whom I was loathe to watch.There is a fine line between a bad movie that is a hoot to watch and a bad movie that accelerates bowel movement and/or brings forth severe mental decay. I wondered if it would be better to have tapeworm cysts swelling inside my brain and giving me convulsions and glimmers of beautiful, prismatic light like Saul on his way to Damascus. At least that pain and horror would have a happy ending -- my death, or my health restored at the hands of medics -- but this was unbearable.However, before watching this wreck, I thought, ""Anne Rice: eat your heart out!"" Then I quickly thought (and thus corrected myself), ""Oh. Right. She's found Christ now -- she doesn't engage in such evil, dehumanizing stories of the 'underworld' but tells happy tales of Christ as he was in life and wants us to embrace them. Now, if she'd only renege on the royalty checks she cashes in due to her globally famous Lestat stories I'd believe her total denial and repentance of such demoralizing wickedness...."" Had I not run into such hasty conclusions! Even when the movie is rife in metallic colors which apply themselves quite well in conveying Gothic gloom, the movie is so chaotic I can't begin to even compare it with Rice's potboilers about vampires. At least she took the time to make me root for her characters even though the stories themselves were ridiculous. What this is, is a convoluted, uninteresting mess that happens to go on for two eternal hours.So let's see. There's a lot of stuff happening during the start of UNDERWORLD, a shoot-'em-out sequence closer to a John Woo movie than horror, vampires at war with werewolves (for what purpose? Is this a thinly disguised story of racial intolerance?), a human caught in the middle who is really more of a non-entity, a love story, cartoonish special effects, equally cartoonish action, flat dialog, heavy metal music, not a shred of character build-up, the presence of a black bodybuilder (whose already artificially low voice makes Hulk Hogan's sound like a squeak) who is prone to flexing his chest muscles instead of his acting muscles, Kate Beckinsale (reason enough not to go see a film in which she appears), some mumbo-jumbo about the origins of such animosity between vamps and werewolves... basically, enough to make you mentally sign a check releasing any responsibility in caring for the plot, popping the DVD out of your recorder, call a priest, and hope for a clean exorcism on your entertainment center. Which, minus calling a priest -- against my convictions -- is exactly what I did because I couldn't take it anymore and I'll enjoy bad movies anytime providing they give me some reason to watch and enjoy them, like FROGS, for example. But not this one -- this demanded action instead of sitting there and sitting there and sitting there. Once action was taken, my mind was restored to its former, unpolluted serenity. Until the next bad, unwatchable movie, that is.",Underworld
86,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Nice concept, so-so story telling",5,14 February 2021,"Universal Studios' classic monster movies from the early days of cinema continues to be one of those milestones that filmmakers look to inspiration for. Whether it's creating new horror figures or working with already existing ones, werewolves and vampires have remained as one of those top types of monster classes. And while these creatures had their fair share of separate features, they did not often cross paths. But of course, once The Matrix (1999) came out along with ""bullet time"", everyone wanted to try a film with this. Leave it to newcomer director Len Wiseman to make this happen by combining these two horror classes in one picture. With that, came the franchise fans couldn't seem to get enough of, despite critics panning it. In order to like it though, one kind of has to be into the style and story.The story penned originally by Kevin Grevioux and scripted by Danny McBride in his first theatrical credit is about a lengthy ongoing war between Lycans (Werewolves) and Vampires. While hunting Lycans led by Lucian (Michael Sheen), one of the vampires named Selene (Kate Beckinsale) sees them following a human named Michael (Scott Speedman). Curious as to why, she makes it her mission to find out what their plans are. Concurrently, Selene's superior Kraven (Shane Brolly) tries to keep her from overstepping her place for soon the lead vampire Viktor (Bill Nighy) will awaken to finally crush the Lycans. For a premise, it seems entertaining enough but that's pretty much where it stops, because there are equally bad parts for the good. It's another surprise seeing that the film was successful, yet fails to impress all completely.The acting in this film is acceptable. All actors give performances probably one would expect. The characters themselves though are the ones that come off odd. Beckinsale's Selene has an interesting history, but why does it seem like she's the only one hunting Lycans? All the other vampires under Kraven dwell in a fancy mansion sitting in fancy chairs. Is that all they do? They don't seem to be in any centuries long war. The character who stands out as the most intriguing is Lucian. He seems the most enthusiastic about fighting the war between the factions and for good reason. That's it though. Not even Scott Speedman playing the macguffin of the plot lends for any strong attention. He also plays a predictably written subplot to that of Beckinsale's character.Adding to these story clichés is the padded run time. The film just breaks two hours and somehow feels longer than that. If the film trimmed off at least twenty minutes, it would have been reasonably paced. Instead, scenes feel longer than necessary. Not to mention the decently shot action sequences matching very close to the slow motion shots filmed in other action movies. All those slow moving frames add up. The picture also ravishes in showing its viewers the set design, which is built very authentically. However, there's a lack of variety. Much of the set pieces are of same locations over and over again. Let's also not forget that there are no daylight scenes. The setting is always dark and rainy. Is this Earth this story takes place in or some other planet?Camerawork was handled like it needed to be however. Tony Pierce-Roberts served as the director of photography and had also worked The Remains of the Day (1993) and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2001). Roberts also makes sure to show the audience a good amount of gore in case anyone was worried the R rating wasn't fortified. Lastly, the score was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had scored films before, but would breakout here with this effort. While much of the work is more atmospheric, there are moments of thematic music that pops in every now and then. Perhaps the more standout components to Haslinger's score is during the action scenes where the music kicks into gear with heavy percussion and synthetic clicks. It's not a great score and works in some places, but overall not impressive.Acting and camerawork are the best parts to this franchise starter. The premise itself is an idea, but the execution is slow in a number of places. Very few characters will get a viewer's attention, the settings are majority singular and the music is more of a product of its time.",Underworld
87,lemon_magic,Strong production values short-circuited by a script that gives the viewer no one to care about,5,29 May 2005,"Right out of the gate, I will freely admit that Kate Beckinsale looks absolutely fabulous in this movie, and she almost carries the whole thing by herself. Plus, the art direction and sound design and cinematography are all top notch.However, the problem is the script and the story that the movie tries to tell. The script lacks any warmth or empathy and turns the movie into a cold, sterile exercise in attitude and pyrotechnics.The plot revolves around an ongoing secret race war between vampires and werewolves. But the whole movie seems set in a world where human beings barely exist. After the initial shootout in the train station, you never actually see another 'normal' human being aside from Speedman's character and his doctor friend. And Speedman isn't really 'normal', either - he's the genetic link between vamps and wolves. This gives the movie an airless, detached feel, with nothing to ground it in believability or reality. This was certainly a deliberate choice, but it has the unintended consequence of making the war irrelevant to my human perspective and concerns. Look at the Matrix films for a contrast - sure, there are superhuman fantasy forces on display in 'The Matrix', but you never lose contact or identification with the very human heroes contending with those forces.Similarly, except for the fact that the beautiful and sexy heroine is a vampire, the viewer is given no real reason to care which side should ultimately win the war. The werewolves are brutal, savage, and merciless; the vampires are decadent, self-involved, and fey, with their ranks divided by internal power struggles and treachery. Neither side is at all appealing except for the juvenile desire to identify with the biggest bad-*ss in the schoolyard.The so-called 'Romeo and Juliet' elements to the film which the promoters try to emphasize, and which supposedly drives the moral center of the film is barely there -it's a 'Bad Hemingway' version of a romance. As far as I can see, we are supposed to realize that the vampire ""Death Dealer"" loves the human male because she doesn't kill him. There is practically no interaction between the two 'romantic leads' until the very end of the movie. They are a couple because the movie ASSERTS that they are a couple destined to be together, but we never see any compelling reason (or evidence) why this should be the case. And it really grates that the vampires get shredded so easily by the werewolves. I thought the vamps were supposed to be winning this war? What's the point of BEING a vampire if all you can do is survive long drops off a fourth story roof? Again, the movie looks great; if the story driving it had been even half as good, 'Underworld' might have been the big movie of summer 2003.",Underworld
88,philip_vanderveken,A nice mix of old and new styles,7,8 April 2005,"In recent years there has been a boom of comic book and fantasy movies and to be honest, only a few of them was really worth my attention. On the other hand I must say that I like (good) vampire movies, so that's why I gave ""Underworld"" a try, even though I have to admit that I didn't expect too much about it.This movie is more than a vampire movie, because the creators have added another mythical creature to the story: the Werewolf. The Vampires and the Lycan (that's the name of the werewolves) are in a war that has been going on for centuries, but that has never been seen by humans. Until now, because the Lycans have found a human that can bond with vampire blood and Lycans blood at the same time and they want to use him as a secret weapon to exterminate the vampires. Selene, a beautiful vampire warrior, uncovers the plot that could prove fatal for her entire race and shadows Michael, the Lycan's supposed human target. She falls in love with him, but doesn't know that he was infected by the Lycans and therefor means a thread to her and the entire convent...What I liked most about this movie was its mix of old and new. This movie has a very Gothic setting (even though some parts of the city are modern) and the vampires still look like ancient aristocrats, but they use advanced weapons and even drive fancy sports cars. Normally I wouldn't really like the mix of those styles, but this time it did work pretty well.Of course this movie is full of action scenes, but there has also been enough attention for details like clothing and make-up and decors. The acting was OK and the story looked a bit as if it was influenced by ""The Matrix"", which isn't a bad thing.

90,slayrrr666,"OK, but nothing too special",8,15 December 2006,"""Underworld"" isn't going to change either creatures' mythologies, but it's still pretty decent.**SPOILERS**Fighting a war for eons, vampire Selene, (Kate Beckinsale) takes an interest in human Michael Corvin, (Scott Speedman) which her werewolf adversaries do as well. Unable to figure out why leader Kravin, (Shane Brolly) doesn't follow up on the confrontation, she rescues him from a further attack by werewolf leader Lucian, (Michael Sheen) and tries to understand his importance. While they spend the next few days making various plans for a return for their elder, Viktor, (Bill Nighy) Lucian prepares an all-out war, and with Michael as the key, the vampires race to stop him.The Good News: There are some really nice things in here. The fact that it mixes so many different areas and ideas into it that it appears to be pretty clever. To be plunked down in the middle of a centuries long war between the two sides is nicely played out, and the few encounters between the sides are pretty much the main reason to see this. From the opening shootout that really goes where it doesn't expect it to go all the way to a slaughter among a train and the drag-down conclusion, there's a lot of action scenes in here. The assault at the apartment is really interesting, with some really innovative ideas and a really fun appeal. One of the main fascinating sequences is the car chase. Starting on a really interesting notion and continuing on inside the car, it's a fun watch with some really interesting and drives off enough of the action film chase scene clichés to get some excitement at the end. The ending is really great about it, and that features some more great parts about the chase. The slaughter on the train is really fun to see, as the overall action and high gore make it a really great scene. That also helps it out when it shows it, as there is some pretty good gore scenes in here. From being impaled with razor-bladed throwing discs, gunshots, scratched open across the face, part of the face sliced off and a very brutal bite on the shoulder, this isn't a gore-fest but it didn't have to be and has just enough for it to be decent enough and appeal to ones who'll really enjoy it. The werewolf design isn't all that terrible either, with a large imposing body, long powerful limbs with vicious claws, and a smaller proportionate head than usual, but it still somehow works for the design. Nowhere near the upper echelon of designs, but it works and that's what matters. The fact that they're actually live and not CGI is a huge plus, as they look more real and have a bigger degree of realism than other types. The all-important transformation comes back into play here, and the fact that they are also done in real time makes it all the better. It's not that terrible, and can feature some good moments when it has to.The Bad News: There are several problems with the film, with the biggest one being that it's just a long bore-fest at times. Apart from a couple of scenes, there's no real action here and consists of long conversation scenes that just wear on and on. This is mostly present in the middle of the movie, which has only one action scene to break things up, and after it's over, there's a long period of discussion going on. Considering that the two sides are supposedly at war with each other, why so much time is spent on talking is rather curious, and would've been far better had this been a really all-out war. That aspect of the story isn't all that well built-up either, and rather than showing the two sides really going at each other with an intense hatred, the confrontations aren't that heated until the end and the ones that happen in between are really lackluster when compared to how a war is supposed to be. The CGI is also a factor, since it always looks so obvious and most of the time can be very noticeable. It's mostly used for what should've been big action scenes, and it really detracts from what's going on. The over-glossy look to the film is one of it's biggest distraction, and it can be a detriment since, out of nowhere, there's this incredibly stylish shot that does nothing really for the film. Instead of being of importance to the film, it's just there because it can be done. There's really no value for them being there. One of the greatest damaging factors is that, since it plays like an action film, there's very little actual horror to it. With no scares or an aura of mystery surrounding everything, it really loses on the horror aspects. These elements really hurt the film.The Final Verdict: There's enough here to like, but there's also a lot to really get irritated about it. If you can get around the negative parts and accept that it's a long, drawn-out action film with monsters as the two sides, it should provide some entertainment value. It's worth a watch, but it's not as great as what's been said about it.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language",Underworld
91,moviewizguy,Unrated Extended Cut Review,5,6 June 2007,"A war has been raging between the Vampires and Lycan for centuries, Selene is a death dealer, assigned to hunt down and eradicate the last of the Lycan. When she comes across Michael Corvin who holds the key to end the war she must decide where her allegiances will lie.I was really looking forward to this film and it fell below my expectations. Usually, these ""war between two creatures"" films are really entertaining, like Van Helsing or AVP, but this one, it's just flat out boring.I really did not care what happened throughout the movie. I didn't care who died or who were the bad guys. It's a great concept but the story didn't interest me and it was partly confusing, although the CGI, cinematography, and production design were good.The action scenes, which were meant to entertain, were boring, more like gun fights from The Matrix rather than any creature fights from monster movies (I understand they have to save their budget). Kate Beckinsale was sexy in her tights but very dull in her acting as well as many could call this a ""dull"" film.This is a very stylish horror film that just falls flat with its boring action scenes and slow pacing. The story isn't interesting enough to follow and the characters dull. Want an entertaining monster film? Watch Van Helsing or AVP.",Underworld
92,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Underworld""- A wickedly entertaining and sleek exercise in style over substance.",8,8 January 2017,"For nearly fifteen years now, the ""Underworld"" franchise has been entertaining audiences with its relatively competent action and overly moody visuals. And that is most certainly to be commended, considering the original film was definitely the product of its time and might not quite hold up for modern audiences with its decidedly dated aesthetic. This is through and through an early 2000's cheese fest, with borderline insane Gothic overtones, melodramatic writing and a penchant for outlandish wire-filled stunt work... yet I have to say, it's a lot of fun. I remember being in High School when this first chapter hit screens, and it was a big hit with us. And even to this day, I still think it holds up rather nicely, if for no other reason than its just so excessive and so stylish, yet with just complex enough a story to keep you guessing, it doesn't lose its effect.Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a ""Death Dealer""- a sort-of vampire assassin who helps wage war in a seemingly never-ending battle against the Lycans- werewolves. However, when she finds herself mysteriously attracted to a human man named Michael (Scott Speedman) who is being sought after by her Lycan enemies, and as she starts to uncover hints of treachery and conspiracy within her vampire house, a chain of events will begin to unfold that will not only change the way she views the world, but may hold the key to changing the war in unimaginable ways...The success of the film really falls onto the shoulders of director/co-writer Len Wiseman and the fairly excellent casting that brings the sometimes stock characters to life. Wiseman is a really interesting filmmaker. I haven't necessarily been a fan of his, and sometimes his choices are just head-scratching... but I appreciate his efforts, and when it pays off (as it does here, or in other films like his amusing and thrilling ""Live Free or Die Hard""), it really pays off. His use of a deathly cold color-palate and overly-Gothic design sensibilities really brings you into the world of the war between vampires and Lycans. It helps to sort-of let us know that we're in a different ""world"" that exists alongside our own. He also just knows how to tell a darned-good action scene, and some of the gun-battles and martial-arts displays he gives us are still pretty darned awe- inspiring even to this day. Even if they can sometimes feel a little hokey, you'll never be bored by his use of action. It really helps to elevate what could otherwise have been a drab, lifeless affair.The cast is just great. Beckinsale might not be an Academy Award winning actress, but she knows how to kick some serious Lycan butt and look good doing it, and she's got just enough of a charm that we can buy the more tender moments of romance and pathos that the film occasionally gives her. There's a reason why Selene is still a popular character and people still enjoy these films. Speedman's role might be a bit under-developed, but he's fine in a supporting role as Selene's love interest, and a few twists later on give him some good concepts to sink his teeth into. Michael Sheen is absolutely fantastic in a supporting role as one of the Lycan leaders- an ancient figure with a definite chip on his shoulder. I'm more used to seeing Sheen in comedic roles, so it's a lot of fun seeing him as a brooding, violent figure. And Bill Nighy is just amazing as Viktor- a vampire elder who is awakened and plays a large part in the story. Nighy chews the scenery with such glee and is just a blast to watch. It's always a treat when he pops up, because no matter how far ""out there"" the role is, he goes for it completely.Unfortunately, the film does have some pretty big issues, most of which boil down to some fundamental problems with the writing and the execution of the material. And that's where it loses a few big points from me. The script by Danny McBride (no, not THAT Danny McBride), from a story he co-wrote with director Wiseman and co-star Kevin Grevioux has a lot of issues with the establishment and conveyance of characters and some themes. It took me a few sittings before I could really wrap my head around things, which is a bit of a problem in my opinion. It can move too quickly while doling out information a bit too haphazardly. I also can't help but smirk and shake my head at the pretentious nature of certain characters and scenes... maybe it's just me, but it always just feels silly when vampire and werewolf characters all have really prim-and-proper sounding names like ""Viktor"" or ""Lucian"" or ""Selene"" or ""Kraven"", all speak with prim-and-proper sounding accents and while all using a lot of five- dollar words. I also think that the film can be a bit contrived at times, like they tried to shoehorn in a bit too much plot to match the action.Still, at the end of the day, this is a Gothic action movie, and as a purely visceral exercise in excess and a display of style over substance... it's a ton of fun. You could definitely do a lot worse. Can it be silly? Absolutely. Can it be confusing? Definitely. But is it always entertaining and will it keep you glued to your chair? Yes, yes, yes! ""Underworld"" is a great time, and would definitely serve well to spice up a slow afternoon when you're stuck at home with nothing else to do. I'd even recommend the first few follow-ups that came out.I give ""Underworld"" an 8 out of 10 just for sheer style and fun.",Underworld

I didn't buy theBLACK LYKIN was a little too DEEP VOICED. I mean, when he played JOHN COFFEE, he didn't have such a deep voice. What also bothered me, was when Michael Clark Dunkin was fighting the VAMPIRE with whips.  Why did that guy show off so much with his whipping technique instead of fighting Michael Clark Dunkin??  Oh well.  Or how about MICHEAL!! He is having a hard time as it is...then he gets TURNED INTO A LYKIN!!??? To make it worse, he gets bit by a bloodsucker???  Where is BLADE when you need him.  If The Matrix had sex with Wesley Snipes of Blade, you would have the UNDERWORLD...of course, there is no WHISTLER TYPE in this movie. This is more of a LOVE STORY with definate SHAKESPEAREAN overtones.  In fact, there are little SHAKESPEARE quotes jarbled up in certain scenes.  I was surprised how much Kate Beckinsale looked like TRINITY from the MATRIX...right down to the SKIN TIGHT LEATHER!!  The dude who played LUCIEAN looked like SNAKE PLISKIN on a DIET.

96,dunmore_ego,Overwrought Underworld.,7,21 July 2010,"Guns, Gore and Grrrrrls in growling leather.UNDERWORLD gives a shot in the arm, so to speak, to the vampire and werewolf iconographies, updating both to be in an ongoing millennia-aged war that is escalating, plopping them in modern day Europe (or somewhere with underground rail transport and rain that won't quit) with automatic weapons and computers. And leather.Selene (Kate Beckinsale, who would soon marry the director - luckiest man alive, Len Wiseman) is a vampire Death Dealer, with guns bigger than her acting abilities and leather so tight and curve-hugging my Carnal Nerve nocturnally emissioned. She's a lethal stalker and killer of werewolves (natch ""lycans"" in sexy new street cred).Story is interesting twist on the legends, yet if you enjoy werewolf slash vampire movies, this may or may not be your cup of blood. You see, whereas all other werewolf and vampire movies have been correctly slotted into the horror genre, UNDERWORLD is an ""action"" movie whose characters happen to be Vamps and Thropes. We're in THEIR world now, so their intrinsic alienness is the norm, rather than an anomaly. Movie can get on with the shooting and running and blood-fests as common occurrence between the two ""races"" (just as any two given races on Earth at any given point in history will engage lovingly in shooting and running and blood-fests). Subsequently, dialog is childish, and action is filmed in that style that suddenly slams into slow motion to accentuate the flounce of capes and the thrill of tight butt-leather, with no meaning other than for the sake of capes flouncing and butt-leather bouncing.Latent werewolf, Michael (Scott Speedman) is bitten by a vampire - to breed a hybrid race that will win the war for the lycans, who are jealous that the vampires have such cool leather. Even though he's a trans-gender, Selene inexplicably falls for Michael. Because he's hot, I'm guessing. But vampire-werewolf love cannot be. So it is written in the ancient scrolls of the TV Guide. For advice on her love life, she calls on the Dr. Phil of vampires, their sleeping king, Viktor (Bill Nighy), who in hibernation looks like a zombie husk of a mummy, until he is revived by fresh blood, whereupon he looks like Bill Nighy (i.e. a zombie husk of a mummy).Casting Kate Beckinsale was not a mistake. Garbing her in such tight leather is. Because I am blinded to anything else when she is on screen. She is just too breathtakingly beautiful, too achingly sensual-- Those pointy incisors; those devil-blue eyes-- Look at that cutie go! Two-fisted gun barrels blazing, Hard Guy Overcoat flouncing, rain dripping pruriently from hand-grab spinner waist in leather-bound corset, spike-heeled boots and porcelain-creamy neck and-- Uh, what was the question again?--",Underworld
97,oneguyrambling,Save yourself 90 minutes; google/images/beckinsale,5,17 February 2012,"I'll cut right to the chase with this one, Underworld is stylish yet forgettable Hollywood filler.It features a name actor for audience recognition, particularly among the target demo of males 18 – 30 (Kate Beckinsale – really a target for males full stop!), an ""actor's actor"" slumming it for fun (Bill Nighy), a young pretty boy faceless enough so that every guy in the audience can imagine themselves in his place when Beckinsale whispers into his ear (Scott Speedman – Tug's brother) and a couple of famous monster species going at it.Sounds OK right? Well let me address my primary concern: the opening scenes introduce both Vampires and Lycans (werewolves), explain a bit of backstory (fight's been going on for centuries) and shows Beckinsale in skintight plastic (nice). Then the scene culminates in a fight between the two warring factions in full view of hundreds in the subway system.Again no probs until I mention it is a gunfight!Wikipedia tells me that: ""Vampires are mythological or folkloric beings who subsist by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of living creatures, regardless of whether they are undead or a living person.""So a shootout seems a little dumb right? Might as well keep the title but make the combatants Babysitter vs Pharmacist.Ahhh but Vampires feed on the blood of the living right? Surely that goes on? Once and only once, and for full disclosure it must be said that a few werewolves actually do get stuck in and wrap their laughing gear around the enemy – but nowhere near enough to say ""how about those werewolves eh?"".So what we have is another Matrix rip off with a couple of decent action scenes, a pretentious backstory and a mixed bag of performances. In the main the characters a re good, but the guy who plays the Vampire leader of the day – they favour a revolving captaincy system – Kraven is absolutely lamentable and had me chuckling at all the wrong times for all the wrong reasons.The Lycan transformations are OK but still not in the same league as An American Werewolf in London, the politics that embroil the middle part of the film annoying and unnecessary and Bill Nighy raises his upper lip a couple times as if to say ""I'm acting!"", then goes back to sleepwalking through his hammy role.I dunno really, this to me is the brethren of Resident Evil, a companion piece of inept monster related franchises. In theory I want to like both, I mean zombies, vampires and werewolves mean that the filmmakers must have the right tools surely? But alas no, for both franchises the high points mean average films, while the many lows plumb the depths of lazy commercial filmmaking.Unfortunately this film marks the high point of the series, but I can't even say that it's worth checking out. Even Kate Beckinsale – the hottest woman in the world for many – is under-utilised in the film. For some reason they choose to try to make her a 5 foot 50 kg hard-ass instead of taking a few seconds to dwell upon her other assets.So if it's a Beckinsale gawkfest your after try google/images/yummoFinal Rating – 5.5 / 10.

98,Maciste_Brother,Pitch perfect Goth comic book come to life!,10,27 February 2007,"It took me a long time to see UNDERWORLD. I only heard bad things about it and the trailer didn't evoke anything in me. So when I finally rented the movie and played it on my home theater system, I was totally knocked-out. From the opening sequence, with the narration provided by Kate Beckinsale, I was hooked.Is it a profound film? Not really. Is the acting brilliant? Not really. Is the story complex? Not really. Does the film look good? Yep. Are the action scenes well conceived? You betcha. Is the Goth atmosphere a near perfect blend of old and new? Yes, yes, yes.I like UNDERWORLD a lot. I believe it's the best ""comic book"" film ever made. It evokes a lot in me, the Goth in me. Personally speaking, I think UNDERWORLD is a near perfect blend of Goth aesthetics: it mixes the old (vampires, werewolves, myths, old world setting, etc) with the new (the sleekness of technology, androgyny, DNA, bleakness of the future...). All of this in one sexy package.It's Grand, almost over-the-top and yet it's very minimalistic in its approach to the story/action. It takes itself very seriously but fortunately, it never crosses the line into camp, which would have made the seriousness intolerable.I usually don't care for action movies with a lot of guns and shooting but here, the gun play is almost part of the soundtrack. The repetitious gunfire is almost hypnotic. When I watch UNDERWORLD, I'm almost in a trance. The composition and look of the film are near perfect. I wouldn't change anything about it. The battle between Selene and Viktor at the end is simply great and razor sharp. Arf. The only weak point in the film is Shane Brolly as Kraven. Wow, what a bad actor!

While it is certainly not the most brilliant and original story, nor does it teem with insight about the human condition, its not awful, its plot heavy, and it really isn't pointless. It's just a tad absurd, though.This is the story of a human (Scott Speedman) entangled in a six hundred year old war between vampires and werewolves, and the vampire death dealer (Beckinsale) whose compassion for him permits her to seek the truth in ways that few of her species have before.The acting is of variable quality. Kate Beckinsale is wonderfully cute, and does a pretty fair job of acting when she's not doing a Keanu Reeves/Neo impression. Michael Sheen provides a great supporting performance. Shane Brolly isn't really up to the task, in my opinion.The script is good, although it's full of clichés.

104,blott2319-1,"Not great, but gets a few things right",5,12 June 2020,"I was already starting on a bad note with Underworld, because I've never been a fan of occult creatures and magical monsters. Sitting down to a movie about a vampire who hunts down werewolves instantly turns me off. It began to win me back, though, because it has a noir vibe to the beginning, and Kate Beckinsale's character is like a detective in some ways. While I don't love the grayed-out color palette of the film, if they were aiming for this kind of neo-noir feeling, then it would be fitting. Where it falls apart is that it blends a bunch of Matrix-style action into a movie that was already trying to juggle two wildly different genres. It just becomes noise and chaos, and ruins any sense of drama or excitement when there are guns blazing constantly.The one thing I do kind of appreciate about most vampire or werewolf movies is that they establish some rules about how one of these creatures is injured or killed. Yet, in Underworld they make those rules fuzzy and confusing. Sometimes the creatures are knocked down by a few magic bullets, other times they can take a million without batting an eye (which then begs the question, why are guns the chosen weapons for either of them?) I found the entire plot to be a bit convoluted and at times stupid. There were some decent casting decisions in the movie, even if it was a bit obvious where certain loyalties lied when I saw actors that tend to get thrown into the same kind of roles in every film.My biggest question as Underworld got going was ""why are the vampires the good guys in this scenario?"" I kept wondering this, because both are dangerous creatures and we have no reason to take a side other than our protagonist is a vampire so her people must be the heroes. But I have to commend them, because they did address this later on in some fashion. I'll say no more, but at least they didn't completely drop the ball on motivations and explaining why we should care. So, while there wasn't much I enjoyed about Underworld, I did give it a slightly higher rating because they handled the storytelling a bit better than I had anticipated.

The story itself is probably the best vampire-slash-werewolf story I've encountered (though admittedly I don't know many, as I'm not really a horror fan), and the ending is just fabulous.I also just love the thing about the chief vampires sleeping for predetermined periods of time, and are then revived - this is incredibly cool.And the whole thing is borne aloft by the great skill of the British lead actors - particularly hard-hitting cutie Kate Beckinsale, wild-eyed Michael Sheen and that late bloomer of a genuine acting icon, Bill Nighy, who gives an unflinching performance.It won't be long now till Underworld: Evolution comes out - and I'm just thrilled at the prospect of seeing more of this stylish world!

107,mentalcritic,A load of...,2,9 March 2006,"The horror and action genres have become so overloaded with clichés that to some extent, they now must resort to great lengths in order to seem mildly unique, leave alone inventive. Underworld attempts to become unique by pitting two overused creatures of myth and legend against one another. Unfortunately, the writer/director is a first-timer, as are both of the writers where feature films are concerned. Sometimes, one can disguise the fact with flashes of brilliance or inventiveness. Nobody would suspect that RoboCop was Edward Neumeier's first sold screenplay, for example. Unfortunately, Underworld wastes no time in showing that Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride have about as much writing talent between them as Edward Neumeier's nose hairs displayed in RoboCop. Indeed, a comparison is fair between RoboCop and Underworld because both try to reinvent a stale genre. Underworld fails where RoboCop succeeded because it has no idea when to break the rules, or how. The fact that it dates itself without stopping for breath does not help.Underworld concerns itself with the seemingly endless battle between the aristocratic vampires and the savage, ornery werewolves. In another attempt to distinguish itself, the word Lycan is used in place of werewolf, despite the fact that Lycanthrophy is generally used to refer to morphing into a number of animals these days. And that highlights one of the most major problems with the film. The makers have a poor attitude, having the nerve to claim that audiences were indifferent to the film because they did not ""get"" things like the use of the word Lycan. This attitude has apparently not changed in the sequel, where the screenplay progressively reverts to werewolf. The problem here is that this telegraphs both the kind of audience the makers were aiming for, in addition to their contempt for the audience. From the editing to the hideous photography, Underworld announces itself as an R film trying to pander to a PG-13 audience. As a result, it winds up in no man's land, trying to appeal to everyone and pleasing no one.Failing to help matters is that the characters have all the extra dimensions of puddles, and the actors are unable to combat the effect. Bill Nighy looks especially uncomfortable trying to deliver his atrocious dialogue, which is heavily burdened with trying to set up the rules instead of putting them into effect. Which only serves to highlight the film's most fatal flaw. In its attempt to make something the audience have never seen without the expertise to make it make sense, Underworld gets bogged down in exposition to such an extent that the middle section could be used to prove Einstein's theory of relativity. In Einstein's most simple explanation of the theory, when one spends an hour with a beautiful woman like Kate Beckinsale, it seems like a mere second, but when one spends a second with their hand on a hot stove, it seems like an hour. The second act of Underworld, in which Selene attempts to secure Michael against those seeking to use him to their ends and expose the truth about Viktor, is like having a wart burned out with liquid nitrogen. The middle of Underworld literally makes one feel as if time is slowing down in order to amplify one's discomfort.Apparently, the makers of the film felt the boredom was insufficient, because they have delivered an extended cut that replaces eleven minutes of existing footage while adding another twelve. While I cannot comment on the extended cut of the film, I can say that it would take a lot more than replacing eleven minutes to address the film's most stunning problem. In contrast to the recent sequel, in which Selene and Michael managed to show enough character to make viewers care about their plight, the entire cast here might as well be dolls with human mouths blue-screened over theirs. One knows even less about them when the film is over compared to when it began. Viktor suffers the worst from this terrible storytelling, with his character having no other purpose to betray his own kind and be an insufferable so-and-so. Matter of fact, the only characters who do not warrant a good punch in the face throughout their screen time are Selene and Michael, which is just as well when you consider that they are the characters upon which the entire film hangs. Even George Lucas was able to give characters like Anakin Skywalker a second dimension during his prequel trilogy, if only barely.As I said in my comments about Underworld: Evolution, the sequel is a bit of an improvement. But when you have a lead-in like this, even the third Matrix episode constitutes an improvement. By comparison, the two recent X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer take a first act that generates tear-inducing sympathy for the most important characters from an educated audience, and adds a second act that has the audience cheering on the mutants as they wage war, regardless of their actual goodness or whatever. By comparison, Underworld is a sleeping pill followed by a dash of coffee. Due to differences in the way my neurochemistry works, neither have a discernible effect upon me, and I would not be overly generous in the description of the effect they have on others. And thus, the failure of Underworld is summarised: in spite of trying to pass for adult-oriented entertainment, it barely has enough to excite the teen audience the studio had in mind. In fact, I feel I am insulting teenagers with that sentence.I gave Underworld a two out of ten. It is too good to be bad enough to be good. Thus, it winds up firmly stuck in no man's land. I have heard it jokingly called Underpants by detractors, and I say if the shoe fits, then wear it.",Underworld
108,hall895,Silly but smart. And fun too,6,28 September 2011,"Vampires and werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skintight rubber. What more could you ask from a movie? Now nobody is going to confuse Underworld with any kind of work of great cinema. But for what it is it works. Yes, the whole thing is rather silly. At times it is very hard to take the movie seriously. So don't bother trying to take it seriously, just enjoy it. Silly vampire movie that it may be Underworld does have some brains to it. The vampire/werewolf back-story mythology is worked out very carefully. The movie's not just vampires and werewolves brainlessly slaughtering each other, there's actually a reason they're slaughtering each other. Much of the back-story is not revealed until well into the movie so you've had time to build your own ideas of what's really going on, who is good and bad, what is right and wrong. Then the movie springs some surprises on you and puts a whole new spin on things. And then the vampires and werewolves resume slaughtering one another.Beckinsale, lovingly photographed with as many butt shots as possible, is the glue that holds the movie together. There's some rather silly stuff she's forced to say and do. Some of the movie's dialogue is rather laughable. But Beckinsale makes it work. She brings an air of seriousness to the proceedings. But not too serious. A movie about a thousand-year war between vampires and werewolves can't be too serious. It needs to be fun. And this movie is. More or less. There are pieces that don't work. One acting performance, that of Shane Brolly as the vampire Kraven, is rather disastrous. The performance is off, the character is off. It's as if Brolly is acting in his own little movie. And his movie is much worse than everybody else's. But the rest of the cast performs admirably. Kate's great in her role of Selene, a vampire whose mission in life is to seek out and destroy Lycans. By Lycans I mean werewolves. The movie insists on calling werewolves Lycans because I guess it sounds cooler or something. Whatever. Michael Sheen makes for an excellent antagonist as the leader of the werewolves. Scott Speedman is appropriately flustered as a human caught up in the middle of all this nonsense. And Bill Nighy gets special credit for his performance as vampire elder Viktor who doesn't look too good when awakened from his long nap. Nighy deals admirably with one of all the all-time movie prosthetic/makeup jobs. The movie looks terrific with some dazzling visual effects, great sets and wonderful costumes. The story takes a little while to get going and has its ups and downs. But it eventually pays itself off pretty well. In the end there is really no ending at all, just a setup for a sequel. This type of thing I generally despise but here I'm actually looking forward to seeing Beckinsale shoehorn herself into that catsuit for some more vampire/werewolf shenanigans. Underworld is by no means a great movie. But its got enough fun and, especially for its genre, enough smarts to make it worthwhile. And it's good enough to make you want to jump back into this world again.",Underworld
109,Beta_Gallinger,"Approximately two hours of misery, gloom, and mayhem, that's about it",4,20 October 2008,"Wow, for quite a while, I was actually expecting to like this movie! I don't recall even knowing about it upon its release in 2003, but was aware of its 2006 sequel, ""Underworld: Evolution"", while it was playing in theatres. I didn't bother going to see it, since I hadn't seen the original, but planned to eventually watch them both when I got around to it. Well, it took a while, but I've finally seen this first film of the two, and while I was expecting to like it enough to watch the sequel, it certainly didn't work out that way. I was very disappointed, and as a result, I saw no point in watching the sequel! A war between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) has been going on for centuries, and one of the vampire warriors stuck in this war is Selene. She is a death dealer, who tracks down Lycans to assassinate. After a battle against a group of Lycans in a subway station, it appears that her Lycan rivals were after a human named Michael Corvin, and following humans is not something they usually do! Unfortunately, Selene cannot get her concern across to vampire ruler Kraven, so she investigates the matter on her own, trying to find out what these werewolves want with Michael. The reason why this particular human is wanted by them is a big part of their plot to gain power over the vampires, something they haven't had for hundreds of years. Also, Lucian, the Lycan leader who was long thought to be dead, has returned! I would say the film opens with a decent narration from Kate Beckinsale as Selene, but it goes from there to a tedious battle sequence (the subway station one, in this case). Unfortunately, that certainly isn't the only tedious battle sequence in the entire film. Some of the acting is pretty weak as well, such as Shane Brolly as Kraven, and the haunted music/sounds hardly ever seem to stop. Like I mentioned above, there really isn't much in the movie other than misery, gloom, and mayhem. I certainly wasn't expecting a really upbeat film, and have been impressed by dark action flicks before, but it all gets so repetitive here, it just keeps going and going, which gets pretty tiresome, maybe even depressing! Nothing really progresses! I didn't really care for any of the characters, either, and ended up not caring about what happened to them or how the story went. Worse still, in addition to all these problems, all the gloom and mayhem is seemingly endless! It seems like it will go on for all eternity, and as I watched, I really wondered when it was going to end, and didn't see any possible way it COULD end! I think I was way too confident that I would like ""Underworld"", even though I wasn't expecting an absolute classic. With that confidence, I rented this action/horror flick and its sequel together, but sadly, that copy of ""Underworld: Evolution"" had to go back to the video store unwatched. At approximately two hours, does this film seem longer than it really is? Well, if you ask me, absolutely! To me, it seemed more like three or four hours! If the film was around, I don't know, half an hour/45 minutes shorter than it is, I would probably rate it 5/10, but since the flaws in the film continue for so long, never stopping until it's over, I think even an average rating would be a tad too generous! Even with all its big-budget special effects, there's something unprofessional and immature about this film, filled with modern clichés. So, sadly, the interesting idea of vampires vs. werewolves had so much potential that wasn't reached!",Underworld
110,SanteeFats,Entertaining,7,11 January 2014,"Not a bad take on the human, vampire, lycan genre. There a some questions that I have though. If the lycan's prey on human's wouldn't there be so many going missing that the human's would notice, even if it was the runaways, the homeless, or those in the boondocks? If only the oldest werewolves can transform at will what do the younger ones eat when they are not in werewolf form? What do the vampire's feed on if not human blood, animal's, blood banks? This does not seem to be answered in this film. Selene is a death dealer among the vampires and goes after any lycan she can. Lucien is the first of the lycan's and is still alive even though he was supposedly killed 600 years ago by a vampire named Kraven. Kraven is just like his name. He entered a deal with Lucien to save himself. Selene figures all this out and raises Viktor, an elder, from hibernation to help her. It turns out that Viktor is the one who killed her entire family centuries ago and turned her. Selene has been led to believe it was the lycan's who did it, therefore her hate for the lycans. She learns of this from Kraven this info leads ends up killing Viktor. Along the way it is discovered that a human descendant (Michael) of the founder of both the vampire and the werewolf lines is alive. He gets bitten by a werewolf and then by a vampire. This would normally kill a human but because of his heritage he survives as a hybrid. Selene has been protecting him from all comers and squirrels him away in semi-hidden places. So at the end of the movie Selene and Michael are safe, at least temporarily, A lot of the bad guys are dead, and only one of the three elders are left, Marcus the son of the founder. Oh yeah, Amelia is the third elder from Europe but she has been killed by the lycans. So there is a really nice set up for the sequel.",Underworld
111,jon.h.ochiai,Romeo and Juliet done Goth,8,5 October 2003,"""Underworld"" under the direction of Len Wiseman is an action Gothic romance set in the world of the House of the Vampires versus the House of the Lycans. This is novel translation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" in the realm of vampires and werewolves. Oddly enough, this is not much of a stretch of the mythic imagination-- which is a good thing. The strong and stunning Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a Vampire Death Dealer-- a vampire warrior who hunts down and kills Lycans (Werewolves). She is very good at what she does. Her cause is the genocide of the Lycan race. This war has gone on for almost the last 1000 years. In this mythology, the vampires are the aristocracy, and the Lycan are the indentured-- serfs for the vampire during the daylight. Over 500 years ago, the Vampire gained a decisive advantage with the murder of powerful Lycan leader, Lucian (a very good Michael Sheen), at the hands of the current Vampire Leader, Kraven (a somewhat effective Shane Brolly). In the slick opening action sequence where Selene and her group of warriors battle the Lycan in a public subway station, signatures of the Vampire and the Lycan race are distinguished. The Vampire are lean, strong, quick, smart, and skillful. The Lycan are loyal, cunning, savage, and possessing great brute strength. This is a cultural war. Through the narrative we learn that the Vampire and the Lycan originated from the the same bloodline which were the original immortals, the Corvina's. The Vampire and the Lycan were the result of 2 different viruses infecting the original bloodline. Selene discovers that the target for this Lycan attack is a human, Michael Corvin (a bewildered Scott Speedman). Corvin is of the Corvina bloodline. The legend is that he can merge both bloodlines and be stronger than either Vampire or Lycan. Selene also begins to suspect that Lucian (Sheen) still lives. So she brings back a trusted Vampire Elder, Viktor (Bill Nighy). But in doing so she uncovers her own past betrayal. Wiseman unveils the Vampire/Lycan mythology with style and expedience. Unlike ""The Matrix Reloaded"", the mythology is not talked to death by it's characters, rather it is unraveled through the plot of finding Corvin, and the attraction between Corvin and Selene-- the star-crossed lovers. The genesis of this war (which does not really give away anything) was a tragic similar romance a 1000 years ago. Wiseman and screen writer Danny McBride, create a fascinating world and an almost timeless tale. Kate Beckinsale in a real departure from previous roles is an awesome action hero. She plays it smart, intense, and charismatic. She performs the action sequences with a sleek, compact, theatric style. And she is always wearing a body formed leather suit-- another good thing. Scott Speedman is solid in support as Michael. The other person who really shines is Michael Sheen as Lucian. There is a sheer kind of joy in Sheen's controlled evil, and dark presence. He is excellent. Credit Wiseman, Beckinsale, and cast in surprising us with some thoughtful entertainment all in an action movie that puts a new spin on the old Bard's classic star-crossed romance.",Underworld
112,phanthinga,Fun but quite long,7,14 September 2018,Came out 1 year after the not so based on the source material Resident Evil but make back the budget and make Milla Jovovich a household name in the action horror genre in 2003 Hollywood once again repeat the success with Underworld when they tackle some good old gothic monster like Vampire and they longtime rival Werewolf by give them gun in the modern world and this time the new femme fatale is Kate Beckinsale in the role of Selene a super badass vampire in tight bodysuit who also the reason why the series famous in the first place.People always say the first is the best but with Underworld it the other way around when there a pair amount of bloody action to be entertained but all the mumbo jumbo about past events that serve an important role to the plot bored me to death.I never watch the Resident Evil series or any other cheesy series for the story cause most of the time they all very dumb and forgettable so to see a movie that should be mindless fun like Underworld take itself way too seriously is just sad.The sequels later on is much more enjoyable when the runtime is short and the action is more over the top but that just my opinion,Underworld
113,ivo-cobra8,The most awesome spectacular film in the series to be ever created!!!!,10,29 October 2015,"Underworld (2003) is one of the most awesome excellent action horror films about Vampires and werewolves. It is the first entry in this fantasy-action franchise. It has Action, twists, romance and an awesome story tel. This is my second favorite film in the series. The first will be Underworld: Evolution (2006). There are two version of this film: Theatrical and the unrated version (Directors Cut) I prefer The unrated version that really makes this movie a hell of a lot better, story wise and action wise: P you learn so much stuff about everything, and you get a lot more action, plus you actually see in the end that Kraven is a coward, as you see him trying to find an exit everywhere.I was blown away by the action sequences and the overall story behind the warring factions. Lots of gratuitous violence and sexy ladies in black latex in leather doesn't hurt either. I love everything about this movie, the darkness, the action and the story. Plus Kate Beckinsale is not too bad to look at.Kate fits in this movie like a glove, she did an excellent job and She kicked ass! COMPLETE AWESOME mix of romance action and adventure!!!!!!! I LOVE it. I love all the twist and turns between the Vamps and the Werewolves. There hasn't been a story like this so it was nice to see something different. It was truly an awesome movie! One of my favorite vampire movies!!!! This is one of my all time favorite action vampire flicks. I love this genre and this story is fabulous. love the acting done by Beckinsale and Speedman, the history between werewolves and vampires is told very well! This is a great adaptation on the Gothic story of vampires with a great introduction to another fantasy race, the lycan. I love how the lycan have elements of werewolves with a close tie to the vampires. The action overall is intense from start to finish. What else can I say about Underworld that was already told? I love Kate Beckinsale as Seline (the Beautiful,sexy, tasty Kate Beckinsale)in her sweet & sexy supple, full-body-suit clad vampire Death Dealer. Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin a medical student who becomes a hybrid. Here is also Wentworth Miller as Adam Lockwood, a colleague of Michael's from Prison Break (2005) TV Series my awesome TV Show. Viktor: (Bill Nighy) he was made for this part, just an awesome performance by a great actor. Lucien (Michael Sheen) excellent performance by him, excellent character. Sophia Myles as Erika, Kraven's trusted ally and love interest portrayed perfectly she was like the only girl who was a vampire and noticed in this film, she acted her role as a real talent! Len Wiseman did a beautiful job writing a story and directing this film. He directed also Live Free or Die Hard (2007) my third best favorite Die Hard film. It is very imaginative and brilliant! The film is also violent, and somewhat bloody. But still entertains, it is fast paced film. I have a lot of funny with it. I love all the characters in here, the finale in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. The end of the film was brilliant, it did end with a cliffhanger but that makes you guessing more what will happened next. What will be in the sequel. In the Underworld, Vampires are a secret clan of modern aristocratic sophisticates whose mortal enemies are the Lycans (werewolves), a shrewd gang of street thugs who prowl the city's underbelly. No one knows the origin of their bitter blood feud, but the balance of power between them turns even bloodier when a beautiful young Vampire warrior and a newly-turned Lycan with a mysterious past fall in love. Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman star in this modern-day, action-packed tale of ruthless intrigue and forbidden passion ­ all set against the dazzling backdrop of a timeless, Gothic metropolis.Underworld is a 2003 action horror film directed by Len Wiseman about the secret history of Vampires and Lycans (an abbreviated form of lycanthrope).

114,fernandoschiavi,"Underworld tries to add dynamism to the plot by including an interesting twist at the end of the second act - but, is too late to save the film",5,10 October 2020,"Even before other franchises that portrayed vampires and werewolves in the cinema, ""Underworld"" appears, which promised to show the conflict between vampires and werewolves that occurs hidden from humans. The production appears as a faithful product of its time, that is, the beginning of the 2000s, inheriting strong characteristics of successes from previous years, trying to emulate an epic grandeur or to bring a believable and different narrative, in which it fails miserably. There is no way to watch Underworld and not see the strong influences of Matrix in the work. The Wachowski franchise had its last chapter released the same year as Len Wiseman's first feature film as a director. That said, despite having numerous practically identical elements, the vampire and werewolf film manages to guarantee its visual identity, but it cannot hide its evident problems, ranging from the script to the direction itself.The work is clearly based on the interpretation games of the publisher White Wolf - Vampire: The Mask, Werewolf: The Apocalypse -, which in turn sought inspiration in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and horror literature. In production, the usual idea of the lone vampire or werewolf is abandoned in favor of the proposal of secret societies existing in the underworld (hence the original title) of large cities. Overall, Underworld is kind of a mix of Terminator, Blade 2 and Romeo and Juliet, if that is possible. The only problem is that he fails to recover the feeling of urgency and threat of the first, the energetic rhythm and good action sequences of the second, let alone the drama of the novel seen in the third. The result is that the film ends up looking like many others, but never manages to stand out.Lycans (werewolves) and vampires live scattered and not solitary, as they are usually portrayed. These same races live in constant conflict, although lycans are outnumbered by being hunted by vampires. One of those hunters is Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who kills them in revenge for what they supposedly did to her family. Although the war ended many years ago, the battles continued. The vampire Selene decides to investigate her immortal enemies and learns that they are looking for a human doctor, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) to experiment, so she also suspects that Kraven (Shane Brolly), the current commander of the vampire coven, is planning a conspiracy with Lucian (Michael Sheen), leader of the lycans, against Viktor (Bill Nighy) the real Coven commander who is in hibernation.
At first, the premise 'vampires' vs werewolves' seems quite interesting, but soon McBride's weak script gives evidence that he will not be able to explore the idea intelligently. The way vampires are portrayed, except for their occasional hissing, brings a mixture of the modern vision worked by Anne Rice in conjunction with the work of Bram Stoker - we see the past and the future of these fantastic beings converging to the same point and the use of technology mixed with the old forms of architecture is placed in the film in an organic way, translating to the image the ancestry of such creatures and, at the same time, their evolution over the years. However, the screenwriter also decides to ignore several classic attributes of the creatures, which mischaracterizes the characters: we can even understand why werewolves can now transform when they feel like it (otherwise, the story could only take place on full moon nights), but there is no reason why vampires can see their reflections in mirrors or why they should stop fearing crucifixes. Besides, what kind of vampire is this that doesn't even drink human blood? In addition to that the sun at no time is an element that must be taken into account or the fact that vampires have some need to feed. Even at a certain point, Selene passes out from having lost a lot of blood, and sometime later she wakes up, without the slightest need to suck the blood of a victim, something so common in vampire films. Even though the cloned blood argument is still presented, this example proves to be, in the end, just another limiting factor, something that ends the savagery of vampires.On the other hand, while the design of lycans draws attention by the use of practical effects, which distances the work of the vast majority of films that appeal to CGI, the ways in which they move ends up making the feature film extremely dated. This, of course, could have been solved by more careful work by the director, who did not need to have exposed this side of the film so much to the viewer, the use of darkness, shadows and cut at the right time would solve many of the work's problems. The special effects, mainly the werewolves' conception, were created and supervised by the Frenchman Patrick Tatopoulos, a well-known professional in the area, having important works in the creation of monsters for TV series and popular horror and science fiction films from the 90s as Dracula. by Bram Stoker, Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla and many others. Later he would assume the direction of Angels of the Night 3: The Rebellion, in 2009. But in relation to the war between the species: what is the use of establishing a conflict between two fantastic creatures if they limit themselves to using firearms in their battles? (The bullets are 'stuffed' with infrared and silver rays). In addition, the supposed romance between Selene and Michael sounds false, as if it were a mere obligation imposed by the story.
Underworld takes on the old narrative of the chosen one, the first of the influences left by Matrix. In fact, it is even funny when we stop to think and see that the work's argument is practically the same as the Wachowski film. See: Michael is a normal human who discovers an entire new reality about the world he lives in the moment he becomes the target of a persecution by unknown figures. In the process he is saved by a mysterious woman, with whom he ends up falling in love and with the stage of the projection we discover that he is special in some way, being able to end this great conflict. It is clear that the difference between the two franchises is in the detail, but just because we can apply this same description to two films released in less than five years, we can already identify the lack of originality of the text about the creatures of the film. night.Fortunately, the way this universe is presented gives a revitalization in the work. Len Wiseman (also a newcomer), even placing his story in the 21st century, gives an almost Victorian look to his images. The constant smokes, the almost exclusive presence of buildings from the late 1800s, along with the darkness in the film create this strong visual language. We are talking about a story that takes place, from beginning to end, during the night and could not be otherwise, considering the creatures addressed. Wiseman's main concern concerns the style of production, not its content - which can be attributed, in part, to the fact that the subject started his career as an assistant art director. Both exterior and interior footage used locations in the city of Budapest, capital of Hungary, in eastern Europe, where producers found the ideal architectural features for what was imagined in Underworld, not to mention the existence of a naturally gloomy climate in Hungary, involving ancestral stories of vampires and werewolves. Thus, the scenes and scene objects seen in Underworld are impressive, deserving to be highlighted, but not all technical elements are equal in quality to their art direction: the visual effects, for example, are incredibly irregular, oscillating between the satisfactory (some of the transformations of the werewolves) and the mediocre (as in the sequences in which the creatures walk through the walls).Likewise, the photography of the experienced Tony Pierce-Roberts is unfortunate: in his attempt to give the film a Gothic tone, he practically transformed Underworld into a monochromatic and visually tiring experience. In addition to technical irregularities, what we see is a weak and poorly developed story. Although he tries to give energy to the action scenes, Wiseman fails to limit himself to copying practically all the most beaten features of the genre, such as slow motion cameras, steel wire stunts and even blows that split characters in half (see Resident Evil, Blade 2). The Gothic-fetishist look a la Matrix is its highlight, as Kate Beckinsale (Van Helsing) running and shooting in tight clothes is always something to be seen. Those who don't like girls, have Scott Speedman (TV series Felicity) as compensation.Another major slip of the film is its long duration. With simply disposable moments and exaggeratedly long action sequences, the projection duration could have been shortened by at least twenty minutes. The result that we see ends up getting tired of its repetition, damaging scenes that would certainly have more impact through a more concise editing work.Predictable and monotonous, Underworld still tries to add dynamism to the plot by including an interesting twist at the end of the second act - but, 15 minutes from the end, the strategy is too late to save the film. The result, directed by newcomer Len Wiseman, pleases the audience for which the film is intended and is unlikely to captivate another type of cinema fan. Underworld is a feature film that ends up pleasing those who do not expect a sensational story of vampires and werewolves. With evident successes in its visual side, the film sins for its script that is not out of the ordinary and for its weak direction and editing, which show too much and make the whole experience quite tiring.",Underworld
115,mitsubishizero,Has a great concept but poor execution,5,21 September 2020,"To be fair, there're some great ideas here but how it's done is clumsy. It's very style over substance. The characters aren't really interesting as we know little about them to care for them or their motives, the story and setting's easy to follow and the action's cool but again, it's hard to get invested when you don't really care about the characters who all seem the same. Many of them are brooding or hollow.While I thought it was ok, I feel like it could've used a few rewrites to flesh out the characters and their motives. The romance between the two just comes out of nowhere. There's very little buildup leading to it. First she saves him then falls in love with him on the fly? It's hard to get invested given how fast it happened. Hopefully, the sequels flesh out the characters more (though that's wishful thinking).If you like vampires and werewolves, I'd say check this one out. Otherwise, find another movie to sink your teeth into.",Underworld
116,TheNorthernMonkee,Matrix's Style x Blade's General Theme = Underworld,7,19 September 2003,"SPOILERSI confess that so far this year, few films have really kept me interested from start to finish. ""Terminator 3"" was acceptable but it's best bit was it's end, ""Matrix Reloaded"" was a poor sequel obviously building up towards an ending (which will probably turn out to be disappointing as well) and ""The Hulk"" had a nice twist on the Superhero Genre, but ultimately was a bit slow at times. ""Underworld"" however, reminds us that perhaps there is life in this new stylish approach of Holywood's. The leather is there, continuing on from so many other films, and by no means is anything to do with Vampires or Werewolves a new angle, however this film combines the two in a stunning visual experience, which, unlike other leather clad films of the year (no names mentioned) has at least some understandable well constructed plot.In ""Underworld"" we're introduced to Selene (Beckinsale in a new lease of life having shifted, at times ineffectively from the innocent British Rose) a hunter of Werewolves who spends all of her time attempting to wipe out this mongrel race for past crimes against her. Eventually we encounter different Werewolves and Vampires (incl the marvellous Sheen as Lucian and Nighy as Viktor) on our way to a typically brutal ending and an even more blatant ending. Truth be told, whilst parts of this film were obvious at times, the almost cliffhanger conclusion was a bit of a surprise to me (weird since Holywood seems obsessed with series of films nowadays), but looking back, no real alternative ending could be considered.This film is a mindblowing piece of cinema with clever Matrix like styling, but with an element of Blade like vampires. Whilst I confess I do prefer the Vampires in ""Blade"" to the ones here, the Werewolves are powerful sturdy, graphically beautiful creatures with whom you can almost consider our animal instincts coming to life.If your more of a fan of the more thought provoking, more realistic films based around the 60s or 70s, then why are you reading this review? If you are however an enourmous fan of watching vampires and werewolves cutting shreads out of each other in a modern day, leather clad, pool of violence and intrigue, watch this. Maybe not the best film of the year in Holywood's mind come the next Oscars, but a cult movie (on the scale of Bladerunner) in the making, and definately the pick of the last few months. This is how the Holywood Blockbusters should have been made. Enjoy.",Underworld
117,russem31,Very well done,8,27 January 2006,"Underworld, is a standout film by director Len Wiseman. Although the story is somewhat uninspired, but this can be forgiven because every other element was top-notch. This includes the proper casting and performance of the main character Selene, by relative newcomer Kate Beckinsale, who dons a spectacular looking costume - she is now guaranteed to be forever immortalized as a toy figure (like the Star Wars characters before her)! Considering also that this film was made for $22 million, I'm really amazed how well they used the budget to make this film look like $50 million at least (sadly, the sequel Underworld: Evolution will have a budget of $50 million yet look just as good as this film). The filmmakers were really innovative with this film and made this into a gem. Definitely worth watching at 8 out of 10 (watch out for the uninspired sequel though).",Underworld
118,swilliky,Decent but nothing special,6,7 January 2017,"The series begins at the supposed end of the war between the vampires and lycans. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a death dealer vampire that hunts werewolves, introduced dropping from a building where she was scowling like a gargoyle. The whole movie is a goth dream mimicking gunplay, leather, heavy metal, and superpowers from the popularity of The Matrix and adding the fantastical twist of mythology.Selene notices that the remaining lycans are trailing a particular human Michael (Scott Speedman). The head of the lycans Lucian (Michael Sheen) has taken a particular interest in Michael. The movie contains some great action scenes that I remember really pleasing me when I was much younger. I always thought this movie had a great mix of action and horror tropes.The plot is all sorts of jumbled picking up in the middle of a story so as to dull any sort of character emotional impact and confusing lots of different threads. There are treacheries and magical happenings that all come together with a bit of ridiculousness that is to be expected in these types of movies. The action lifts it up and the special effects don't look terrible even after thirteen years of advancement. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Underworld
119,Libretio,HELLRAISER meets THE MATRIX by way of THE HOWLING,4,25 February 2005,"UNDERWORLD Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS-8The ongoing conflict between vampires and werewolves reaches its zenith following the discovery of an unwitting human (Scott Speedman) whose bloodline could prompt the genesis of a vampire-werewolf hybrid...Len Wiseman's grandiose offering has plenty of flash-bang-wallop but not much sparkle, and Danny McBride's disappointing script buries an imaginative premise beneath the dictates of a 'blockbuster' mentality. The film's big selling point is lead vampire Kate Beckinsale (PEARL HARBOR), clad in form-fitting leather trenchcoat (no slobbering at the back there!), who holds her own against an army of monstrous adversaries. Most of the supporting characters are played in broad strokes by an otherwise talented cast, including Michael Sheen (BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS) as the werewolf leader who struggles to contain the aggressive tendencies of his bloodthirsty minions, Sophia Myles (Lady Penelope in 2004's THUNDERBIRDS) as the ambitious young beauty who struggles to emerge from Beckinsale's shadow, and sexy Shane Brolly (DEADLY SWARM) as a misguided vampire who forms a clandestine alliance with the werewolves, leading to all manner of complications. However, industry veteran Bill Nighy steals the show as a vampire-lord woken from his centuries-long slumber by Beckinsale, precipitating a violent escalation in the conflict.The soap opera plot gets lost amid a string of ostentatious set-pieces, most of which involve vampires and werewolves pursuing each other through a Euro-Gothic landscape (Bruton Jones' superlative set designs are the film's trump card) and firing endless rounds of ammunition at one another, a scenario repeated (with minor variations) throughout the course of the film. It isn't frightening, or even remotely profound, merely noisy and excessive, which is par for the course these days. Production values are top-notch throughout, though the full-body werewolf suits (designed by GODZILLA's Patrick Tatopoulos) are a little too rubbery-looking, and the transformations from human to lycanthrope - though impressive - are clearly computer-generated, which rather spoils the effect. A sequel is currently in the works.NB. Though credited as 'Digitalscope' in the closing titles, the movie was actually photographed in 3-perf Super 35 and subsequently transferred to high-definition video, where it was completed in the digital domain before being reprinted to 35mm for theatrical release. Sadly, Wiseman and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts don't make much use of the 2.39:1 frame, so the technology is largely wasted.",Underworld
120,EijnarAmadeus,Surprisingly good!,4,21 May 2004,"UNDERWORLD may not be as good as BLADE, but it is really a entertaining movie! Vampires versus werewolves I must personally that such a plot is pretty funny watching. Kate Beckinsale is also pretty freaking cool in her main character, although she is brutally inspired by Matrix, she is pretty fine! The movie's opening scene is really beautiful, and then I'm not pointing at the action sequence but the few moments where Beckinsale is sitting on this balcony in the constant rain, sort of twist between BLADE and BATMAN. Vampires is supposed to be erotic, charming and deep folks, but I really don't think they've successed making that part. And one of the things ruining the movie is the werewolves, yeah actually. They get too stupid pity enough, too much of the goods. The special effects are nothing more than okay, so where this movie really scores points is at the cool-factor, the pure entertainment and Beckinsale, yeah, she does a surprisingly good performance and, she is sexy! UNDERWORLD is a very above the usual action-movie, I liked it...a bit! STARS: 3/5",Underworld
121,deatman9,Interesting story just not for me.,5,26 October 2012,This movie was not all bad I mean the story was original. Thankfully something different with vampires. I just did not care much for the story line however the effects and acting was good it just was not what I was expecting.This movie is about a war between werewolves and vampires. One woman is a vampire but she falls in love with a werewolf who just wants the war to end.I know a lot of people really like this movie but I really don't. The story line was just kind of cliché and predictable and throwing a romance element in there just kind of ruined it.,Underworld
122,Darkside-Reviewer,"I'm ""Lycan"" the leather",7,23 January 2021,"I first saw Underworld upon it's release in 2003 and honestly upon my first viewing of the film I thought it was just another generic vampire/werewolf action movie. A few years later the sequel (Underworld Evolution) (2006) was released and again I didn't really enjoy it all that much. Over the years more sequels were made that I didn't even bother watching after the first two. Since it's been almost eighteen years since I first watched Underworld. I decided to give the movie a second chance and watch the extended special edition on Blu Ray.Underworld tells the story of a modern coven of Vampires who after over one thousand years of war with their arch enemies the Lycan (Werewolves). The Vampires have hunted the Lycan to the brink of extinction. A vampire named Selena (Kate Beckinsale) uncovers a secret nest of Lycans hiding in the sewer lead by a powerful Lycan named Lucian (Michael Sheen) who was thought to be long dead. Selena brings the news to the Vampire leader who doesn't believe her leading to Selena breaking the rules and going solo so she can uncover the truth behind how Lucian survived and how he plans to end the war between the Vampires and the Lycan.Underworld is filled great looking action scenes of Vampires and Werewolves fighting with fangs and claws. Instead of using old fashioned weapons like wooden stakes and silver daggers. The Vampires shoot the Lycans with siliver bullets from modern day weapons like handguns and machine guns. They also use bullets with liquid silver in them that slowly kill the Lycans by entering silver into their bloodstream. Aswell as transforming into their Werewolf form and using their claws and teeth to kill the Vampires. The Lycans also use modern day guns with Ultraviolet bullets that burn the Vampires from the inside.There's plenty of blood and gore throughout the movie including things like decapitations, severed limbs, Werewolves being blown up leaving chucks of meat and body parts everywhere aswell as Vampires and Werewolves biting each other and humans. The body transformation from the Lycans human form to their Werewolf form is done well with great looking special effects and CGI especially by 2003 CGI standards. The Lycans always look like they are in extreme pain when transforming which adds to the transformation making it look and feel more intense and frightening.Kate Beckinsale is dressed in leather in every scene of the movie even when there's no action going on and she's just using a computer. The same goes for practically every character in this movie they all wear leather or black shirts with leather pants. The only time a character is without leather is when they take their shirt off or transform into a Werewolf.I'm not sure if it's due to nostalgia or my taste in movies changing over the years but upon my second viewing of Underworld after almost eighteen years I actually really enjoyed the movie this time around. I grew up in the late 90s early 2000s when movie's like (Blade) (1998) and (The Matrix) (1999) were extremely popular. That particular era of movies can be defined by four simple words leather, guns, brooding, angst. Watching Underworld now in 2021 I realise just how much this movie is a product of it's time and really if it was released just a few years earlier in the year 2000 this movie would of been a lot more popular. Sadly by 2003 these kind of movies had started to become all to familiar with audiences including myself.I highly recommend watching Underworld especially if you have never seen it before. If you have seen it before and you didn't enjoy it the first time around I recommend giving it a second chance especially if you grew up in the early 2000s.",Underworld
123,anselmdaniel,A slick action thriller,7,17 November 2018,"This review contains spoilers.Underworld is an action horror film directed by Len Wiseman. The movie stars Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman. The movie is about a secret war between Vampires and Lycans. The movie follows Selene, a vampire Death Dealer, that discover a Lycan plot.Underworld has riveting action scenes that are fun and stylistic to watch. These action scenes have a great gothic style to the scenes. These action scenes are also headlined with a good performance by Kate Beckinsale. The action in this movie are incredibly visceral and gory to watch. The action scenes are a big plus to this movie.The movie's world and characters are interesting. The movie does well with its dialogue and history. The movie spending the time to do this is a nice change of pace as the movie uses it as a break between the action scenes. It is nice to see the characters have an actual history with one another that should have been expanded upon further.The movie is vapid in its plot and characters. I wish that the movie focused on the character history more than the strange plot. The plot seemed like it wanted to be an excuse to have action and a reasonable plot. The movie made many strange concessions to have both. The movie should have been more of an action movie or a plot driven movie and not both. There are still some
good scenes in this movie.Overall I would recommend Underworld.Grade: B",Underworld
124,gigan-92,An Awesome Thrill Ride of a Movie,8,4 July 2011,"This was an awesome film to watch. Firstly, the Gothic style of the architecture and dark lighting gives the film a magnificent look throughout. The shots are epic and the look of the werewolves is terrifying. Some criticize the 'over-acting' but in general it's still pretty good. As a fan of classic horror and monster films, it was great to see the amount of mythology that went into the screenplay. Kate Beckinsale was pretty awesome in her role and was a great anti-hero. There are great characters here, which are why I enjoy it so much, like Lucian played by Michael Sheen. My favorite of them all is Viktor. He had an incredible presence only Bill Nighy could give off. Some characters are left poorly developed, especially Raze (Kevin Grevioux). He could've used more screen time and the character of Michael Corvin was a decent character but he doesn't really stand out until he becomes the hybrid.But the pacing is fantastic and the score by Paul Haslinger really surprised me. The action hits hard and the setting just completes the film. The near climax portion of the plot might lose a few but it's just a fun movie to watch.",Underworld
125,Antagonisten,Kate Beckinsale in leather,6,13 March 2006,"When i tried to watch this movie the first time i didn't even get past the first fight scene. I thought it felt like such a cliché i didn't even want to see the rest. But now i gave it a second chance. And well, not as bad as i expected the first time around, but i don't know if it's that good either.The style of this movie is sort of the classic ""bits and pieces"". Meaning that the director and script-writer has taken small pieces of movies they like and put it together into a movie of their own. Now and then i just felt like ""Oh, that's The Matrix"" and ""Oh, that's Blade"" and so forth. Not that there is anything wrong with that necessarily as long as you have something of your own to add to the mix.So, what worked? Well some of the action scenes were pretty good. The actors took the whole thing the way they should, the acting didn't become neither pompous nor silly like it so often does in vampire movies. And admittedly Bill Nighy is always a joy to watch, as is Kate Beckinsale in tight leather (although a different kind of joy completely). Also, as someone else mentioned in their review, the lack of comic relief was very positive. Nowadays it seems nobody can make an action or horror movie without pushing in stupid one-liners and quips. Here though the mood is kept throughout, which is refreshing. And what didn't work? Well, the whole story is a bit silly really. Vampires fighting Werevolves, and nobody noticing apparently since there is no police and seldom any regular people in the city where this whole thing is taken place. Also the fight scenes again, while some of them were well done, many of them lacked the real nerve. When the fighting is done between two different kinds of monsters i want to see fierce fighting, animal rage and carnage. Here we get some sort of martial arts Matrix style mixed with a little biting. Which really takes the edge of.To sum the whole thing up i found this movie to be less bad than i had anticipated. Certainly no masterpiece and absolutely not a classic, but still a decent entry into the worn genre of Vampire movies. Also any Vampire movie that excludes the whole eastern European accent thing more or less completely gets at least one extra point.",Underworld
126,EmperorNortonII,New Blood For Vampire Legends,7,10 April 2004,"""Underworld"" is no ordinary horror movie.  It tells the tale of a secret war between vampires and werewolves (or as they're called here, lycans).  Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a lethal assassin on the vampire side.  Scott Speedman plays Michael Corvin, a man who finds himself wrapped up in this brutal war.  This movie is rather well done, despite all the blood and graphic violence.  The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brooding, which fits very well with the story.  The script is interesting, using science to bring the vampire and werewolf legends into the modern age (such as saying the lycans are allergic to silver).  The story of the bitter rivalry between to two mythic characters would make a fascinating prequel, and the sequel should follow ""Underworld"" with real impact as well.",Underworld
127,MichaelMargetis,One of the Most Interesting Vampire Movies I've Seen,6,29 April 2005,"When I went to the movie theater to go see Underworld, I was expecting it to be a major bomb. But actually, it wasn't. It was actually pretty intriguing and it held my attention during the whole movie. At parts it was a little bit confusing, and I had to ponder something. And also the acting was not really that great. Kate Beckinsale was good ... but that pretty much is about it. But the film was important to me because it's been a couple of months since I saw a movie at the movie theater that was kind of different from the rest. I wouldn't say Underworld is really a horror film at all, but I kind of action film with a little bit of Shakespearian drama going on during it too. It is pretty much a Romeo and Juliet story with a lot of gore and supernatural events. The story is about the never-ending feud between the family of Vampires and the family of Likens - or Werewolves (remind you of something? ... The Montagues and The Capulets.) A liken assassin or as she calls herself a 'death dealer' Selene (Beckinsale) falls in love with a human who has been bit by a liken, Michael (Scott Speedman - Dark Blue). By falling in love they both try to end the long-time feud and try to figure out how far it goes back and why it happened.

128,harryplinkett14,Irritating drivel,1,20 October 2019,"This is what you get when some genius with no talent for filmmaking cpmes up with the idea to do The Matrix with vampires. And werewolves. And lots and lots of CGI. Most of it not very impressive.
The screenwriters seem to think they don't actually need compelling characters or an involving story to have a film. Don't get me wrong: the story is there, but it's a convoluted mess that confuses the audience with endless exposition, while providing no emotional payoff of any kind. We just don't care about these characters, and frankly, we don't even know what is at stake. Who is on whose side? Who knows what? What's the motivation of the protagonists? Good luck trying to figure that out. By the way, half the film consists of annoying flashbacks that pile up tons and tons of new information. Did a vampire film have to be so convoluted? How about a simple story, but one that makes people feel something?
If someone asked me to summarize the plot in a few sentences, I couldn't do it. It's too complicated. And I didn't understand anything anyhow. And does the main protagonist have any emotions whatsoever? I have seen video game characters with a more distinct range of emotions.
P.S. There is even a sequel to this. Or was it more than one sequel? Who wanted to see more of this nonsense?",Underworld

Well, I am happy to say that, despite it's age, ""Underworld"" is still a great and very fun movie. Of course, it isn't a masterpiece, far from it. But it's what I think movie about vampires should be. My objections? Action could be better... A lot, lot better. If only someone who knew how to make good shooting scenes worked at the movie, we would have a gun fu epic, this way it's just average most of the time. Though I didn't watch the rest of the series, I know the quality sinks lower with every movie, so, if you need to watch one and be done with it, it would be this one, and not the prequel or sequels (and I doubt watching the prequel or sequels will change my mind).

132,Flagrant-Baronessa,"An innovative, entertaining mixture of styles",7,9 August 2006,"I'll be completely honest - vampires in tight latex suits fighting werewolves is not my idea of Citizen Kane. But Wiseman's Underworld (2003) is such a pleasant surprise on every level. Sure, it is not the most original action/horror out there, but I believe it does innovative things in mixing old-school vampire flicks with new stylized Matrix effects. The novelty of this fresh mixture is so entertaining in this film and better yet, it is seen through a grey-bluish film noir tone, bathing Underworld in a dark atmosphere.The story is completely solid and while there is a lot to keep track of - twists, characters, names, history, it never strays from its template plot, which is the politics and action of the raging vampire-lycan war that Selene (Kate Beckinsale) fights. Onto Beckinsale then, she is absolutely abominably atrocious in her role. Her acting spectrum is frightening narrow, giving us one facial expression that she recycles for every emotion (and the emotions are sparse). Please.Stop.Acting.Aside from Beckinsale, nothing really needs to be said about the performances of the rest of the cast because it is not what is in focus in Underworld. It isn't character-driven - it's action and visually driven. The villains are all nuanced, colourful and charismatic and that is what matters (that, and Shane Brolly is sexy as hell). The ending may seem somewhat anti-climactic, but now we know why - Mr. Kate Beckinsale already had a sequel in mind, making the ending of this film only assured on his part, paving the way for 'Evolution (2005).That film happens be incredibly disappointing, but that's another story and Underworld is surprisingly good. 7/10",Underworld

Len Wiseman really put his heart into this story, the craft is just exceptional. Kate Beckinsale was a great choice to play Seline, the lead vampire and main character. However, it was Bill Nighly that really flourished in the film playing the stern ruthless head vampire, Viktor.

135,charchuk,"Stylish, Gothic action thriller with depth",7,20 August 2006,"I'm a sucker for stylish action thrillers and Gothic horror flicks, and I love vampire and werewolf movies when done right, so I'm pretty much inclined to love this film based on concept alone. Luckily the execution nearly lives up to the hype. There are some plausibility issues (despite the fantastical setting), and the story, while intriguing, isn't explored well enough, but the film is so interesting and entertaining that it doesn't really matter. A perfect example of style over substance, though the substance isn't completely missing.The story in itself is quite interesting, even if the plot is a bit disappointing. The original pitch, 'Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves', isn't that accurate, and it would have been a bit better had it been. Instead of a vampire falling in love with a werewolf, she falls in love with a human who becomes a werewolf (and then, later, a hybrid, which kinda ruins it). A slight difference, but a noticeable one. The overall setting - an ongoing war between the two species - is very cool and quite original, and is made even more effective by the fact that the film begins right in the thick of it, without much exposition. The history is explored later (not nearly deeply enough, though - that's left for the sequel), which makes it much more interesting. A deeply ingrained mythology accompanies all the stylish action, making it more than just a B-grade action flick.One of the main highlights is the entire style and tone of the film - it's always night, and it's always raining. Very dark and creepy, just adding to the horror element. In between all the gunfights, there are scenes set in a vampire manor or a werewolf den, which helps ground the film with some sort of realism. The special effects are fantastic, despite being on a pretty small budget, as the werewolf transformations - and, indeed, the beasts themselves - are nearly flawless. And the acting is as good as you can expect from an action/horror/thriller, with Beckinsale, Michael Sheen as Lucian, and Bill Nighy as Viktor all standing out.

138,Danny_G13,Stronger ending redeems the rest,5,1 April 2004,"A dark vampire action thriller - these are always appealing to me. Something about the lives of vampires is extremely enviable - all the sex, drugs, rock and roll with lashings of blood somehow seem *very* seductive.Underworld is the first one I've seen in a while and fails to entertain for much of its duration, which is unfortunate, as usually the mere 'atmosphere' and 'look' of these type of films is enough to grab my attention. Here those aspects simply serve as a platform, and don't particularly draw you in. Kate Beckinsale is Seline, a vampire who's part of an ongoing war between her kind and the Lycans, (Werewolves) a war whose origin is not made clear till later on. Kraven is the leader of the vampires, but Seline despises him and hankers for her dead mentor, Vincent, the former leader, which alienates her from her ilk. However, things get dangerous with the emergence of Michael, a mortal who the Lycans appear to be after, for reason the vampires must find out.This sets the pace of the movie, the story essentially evolving around him.The main problem with this picture is the acting is appallingly banal and lifeless, with absolutely cliched characters because none of the actors are capable of making their part their own. Mundane dialogue with insipid delivery serves to bore rather than grip. The only actor who breaks this chain is Bill Nighy, who commands the screen every time he appears. He's not even that outstanding but the feeble competition makes him look so.The second problem is drab direction. At no point for the vast majority are we made to feel part of what we're watching, because it fails on so many levels to suck us into its world, which is essential in any good film, especially one with such a distinct theme. The action itself seems to be going through the motions too, with decidedly uninspired gunfights and slaughter scenes.However, amazingly, the last reel is actually rather good. Without giving anything away, obviously events come to a head and for once, the acting is tolerable and the plot genuinely gets interesting. The final action sequence isn't *overly* breathtaking, but it's reasonable, and finally the film pulled me in.Just a pity it took seemingly forever to get there.",Underworld

Worth a look see.,8,30 March 2007,"The acting performances were very acceptable for the most part, but the thing that made this film zing was direction by Len Weisman. The fast paced acting with the ever twisting plot line always leaves you wondering if someone told a joke and you were left out on the punch line. Beckinsale has a standout performance. I found Speedman a bit weak, but only in as much as his character was not brought into the center of things really until late in the film. Sheen was excellent as Lucian and Bill Nighy brought the right mix of slyness, compassion and betrayal as Viktor. If there was one performance than irritated me throughout it was Kraven. The use of The Hungarian setting was just perfect for the feel of Gothic meets modern called for in this story. I am waiting to enjoy the sequel, when I can get my hands on it.

140,Trevor-Kerensky,An underrated title,7,12 July 2018,"I'd heard so many negative reviews about this movie but I actually saw it in theaters with a friend. This was the first Kate Beckinsale film I actually liked. She made a good vampire she-warrior. It's no longer good versus evil but a story of survival. Who are the true villains? Vampires or werewolves? Or is there something darker at work? There's a lot going on and I found myself wondering who was who and what was going on throughout the film. It went pretty quickly. But in the end, it was a satisfying story that ended with an opening for a sequel. I remember coming out of the theater and hearing two people, a man and a woman, talking about it. They were both older than me, and the man apparently enjoyed it, but the woman said it was stupid. Or something like that. But as for me, it wasn't the worst film I had seen. It's no Oscar contender either but most movies aren't Oscar worthy. I mean, who really needs the Oscars? It's just a clique. Anyway, back to the movie. I was entertained and I especially liked how the makeup was done on the characters. Really creepy but cool. If you want action and vampires and werewolves, try this.",Underworld
141,reb-warrior,The genesis of the series franchise is really good. Selene is badassed. Great for those that love the fantasy vampire goth genre. Lots of awesome action.,10,4 March 2021,"I still love this movie after all these years. The writers came up with a whole history of the war between the Lycans and Vampires. They really fleshed it out really well in the first three movies starting with this one. In fact, in this movie, you hear how Vampires and Lycans even came into existence, via Alexander Corvinus. The plot is absolutely there.Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, have great chemistry. Selene is the ""star character"" of the movie and of the franchise. Wanting revenge against the Lycans for killing her entire family 600 hundred earlier. However, she finds out a few truths that change everything. Beckinsale really delivers everything that is needed for this character, including lots of awesome action.You may think there are weak points, like how the Vampires/Lycans are getting with all this stuff without being found out by humans, but later in the franchise series, you find out why that is. There is an established setting already. So sometimes you hear characters talk about other characters or events that happened. You almost feel like there could be several more prequels if they wanted. But they did a good job explaining everything as part of the plot.This movie serves the more modern goth-ish era when bands like Evanescence, Nightwish, Within Temptation were at the height of their careers. Selene in all black, long black coat, black hair, dark eyelashes, pale white skin fits the bill. I recommend it for people that like fantasy, vampire, goth, genre. This is the beginning of a continuing story. 10/10",Underworld

However this is, THAT, type of movie. You know, werewolves, vampires, guns, lots of leather (why don't armies issue all their troops with tight fighting leather outfits, as they are sooooo practical for fighting in), lots of black and CGI.Vampires fight and kill werewolves, the question is why. Set in Eastern Europe such a plot has a range of intelligent options that could be explored, but a ignored and simplified (and explained repeatedly so Americans can follow the plot).I loved the action, and yes the CGI is not that great, but this is not a big budget movie. The plot idea has depth, even if the story skims over it. There is enough plot material for an entire series, unfortunately it is crammed into one movie.Bad guys and good guys are ambiguous in so many ways. At the end of the day, this little, effects driven movie that follows on from Blade and The Matrix is an interesting story for lovers of THAT type of movie.Others may not get into it so much, but we can wait for the sequel and the prequel to see if they have the courage to delve into the true depths of this story.",Underworld

The over-the-top action reminds me of a video game, which is really fun to watch. I think it long surpasses The Matrix in this aspect, as well.The blue camera effects and Kate were both amazing. The plot line was just as slick and stylish as the action. But the werewolves were stupid looking. That is the single style choice I think I disagree with. I've heard people call it the new Romeo and Juliet, but that is untrue. It follows that structure for a while, but by the end it dismisses anything that would even suggest that. This blows Romeo and Juliet out of the water, anyway.Action-horror fans will be in awe. As long as you don't look too deep, I don't see why people seem to hate it so much.5/10",Underworld
145,tburke85,Underworld A Decent Gothic Sci-Fi Action Adventure,7,22 June 2009,"Underworld is a decent Gothic sci-fi action adventure from director Len Wiseman who does a good job in making this movie but there are some flaws that weigh it down. I'll get back to that later. Kate Beckinsale turns in a solid performance as the lead Selene a vampire Death Dealer in the middle of a war between her race and werewolves known as Lycans. She looks great in leather and is convincing as the character especially in the action/fight sequences. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael Corvin who eventually becomes a powerful vampire/werewolf hybrid because something to do with his blood. He gets a few fight sequences near the end that are impressive but for the most of the movie he's either being chased, running, or being held prisoner. Speedman however like Beckinsale is good as his character. Michael Sheen is terrific as Lucian the Lycan leader whose supposed to have been dead and is after Michael for unknown reasons until those motives are revealed later on in the film. Sheen's role may get cut short near the end but he does a great job of portraying someone who you're not sure is either the villain or a man simply driven by revenge who is willing to do whatever is necessary to defend his race. Well done. Bill Nighy is equally impressive as one of the vampire Lord's Viktor but he isn't given a lot of screen time and his showdown between both Michael and Selene near the end felt a bit rushed. He's also easily defeated but Nighy is effective in the role none the less. The rest of the cast including Shane Brolly, Sophia Myles, and a brief appearance by Wentworth Miller are okay in their roles but don't have much to do. The action/fight sequences are well executed but a slow pace in between made the movie fee a little long. The film seemed to be juggling a bit too many characters and it sort of lacked a central villain because there are quite a few of them in this one. If they had focused on just one instead of Nighy, Brolly, Sheen, and many more the movie would've been a little better. It did have a Gothic feel which seemed to fit with the tone of the film and made it a little different than some sci-fi action movies out there. The music seemed to match well with what was happening on the screen as well. So despite some flaws Underworld may not be the greatest movie ever made but it's certainly not the worst either. Overall Underworld has an intricate story, intense action, some suspense, cool special effects, and good performances by the cast who make this sci-fi movie worth watching at least once.",Underworld
146,Darkest_Rose,A Waste of Time,4,20 September 2003,"Selene(Kate Beckinsale) a vampire warrior and a death dealer, along with the rest of her kind, is in a war with the lycans and hunts them down and kills them. But things get complicated when a human(Scott Speedman) gets bitten by a lycan and Selene falls in love with him. Slowly she starts finding out about her past, how she became a vampire in the first place and why vampires and lycans hate each other. Now, this movie may sound and look good in the trailer but it definitely isn't. I like old-fashioned vampires, not vampires who wear leather pants, own guns and spend time on the internet. There was way to much action going on but not much of a story. This movie was very boring and too long and just a big waste of time. I would give Underworld 4/10, for some good scenes and because it could have been a better movie if it tried.",Underworld
147,willywants,"Had the film not taken an MTV approach, it might have been pretty good...",4,27 August 2005,"Set in some timeless world where vampires rule, clans of werewolves are being hunted and killed to the brink of extinction by the vampires. A wolf hunter, Selene, begins questioning is she's taken the right side, and slowly uncovers the truth behind how she became a vampire. Now since I like to consider myself a fair critic, I'll start with what I liked about ""Underworld"". For one, the overall premise is very good. I especially like the fact that we never know when or where the film actually takes place (we never see outside the city) and the timeless feel of the film. While the acting wasn't exactly outstanding, everyone was serviceable and there wasn't a single actor here I could call ""bad"".Thirdly, the creature effects were awesome. Thankfully the werewolf were usually brought to life via practical effects, with CG limited mostly to the transformation scenes (I wish these too were done practically, like in American Werewolf in London or The Howling, but I guess in a year like 2003, that's too much to ask forthat's pretty sad). There was also a good amount of blood and gore too, thankfully this is an R-rated film that actually DESERVES it's R-rating. I also liked the ending, which in my opinion was clever and unexpected (well, as clever and unexpected as a dumb action film can be). This, unfortunately, is where the list of positive aspects ends. Len Wiseman's direction is wwwaaayyy too commercial for my taste (you know, MTV-style camera angles, slow-motion fight scenes, etc.), the music is crap (mostly rock musicwhat's wrong with using a REAL score these days?), the action is often unrealistic (and not in a fun way) and the CG, while not used excessively, was cheesy and unconvincing. I know that the positive aspects will outweigh the negatives in some people's opinion (in other words, I can understand why some people will enjoy this film), but for me the movie really didn't do anything.Sorry.4/10.",Underworld
148,rparham,Emotional dead zone,5,11 October 2003,"One part The Matrix, one part Blade, Underworld is yet another modern take on vampires that bypasses the traditions of the genre (black cloaks, castles, striking male vampires with Eastern European accents) by embracing what are quickly becoming a new set of traditions of the genre (black leather, spandex, low lighting, lots and lots of automatic weapons) and failing to make any of it the least bit compelling.  Underworld is just dead space, a well-polished engine that goes nowhere fast.The initial premise sounds very promising:  Vampires and werewolves have been engaging in a secret war for thousands of years, with the aristocratic vampires holding the upper hand.  That upper hand are ""Death Dealers,"" elite werewolf-killing assassins, who approach their job without remorse.  Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one the best Death Dealers, living for the thrill of the kill.  Now, however, her world is threatened by a new element:  a human named Michael (Scott Speedman) who the werewolves, referred to in the film as Lycans, have their eye towards, for unknown reasons.  Eager to find the answers, she defies the leader of her coven, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and begins conducting an investigation, finding herself falling in love with Michael.Despite the possibilities the setting provides, Underworld does very little with it.  The film is basically one long set of shoot outs and fight scenes, all well-choreographed and photographed, but there is no real substance to anything.  It doesn't help that the main characters, Selene and Michael, are completely empty of any development.  They have seemingly less dialogue than the supporting characters, and neither is well-developed by the screenplay at all.  We get a hint of background for Selene, but it is too little too late, and Michael is a cypher, lacking any significant backstory to his character, and barely a handful of scenes, it seems.  The romance of these characters is supposed to draw us in, but I couldn't have cared less. The romance is without an semblance of interest or emotion, leaving the film without an emotional core to hang our interest on.The supporting cast, especially Michael Sheen as a lead werewolf, are far more interesting than the leads, but the script proves rather thin.  The plot seems rather half-explained, not to mention underdeveloped.  When the big ""surprises"" of the film are revealed, it elicits a ""So? That's it?"" response.  The film is also hampered by Shane Brolly as Kraven, the only character who could classify as a villain.  His performance plays as if he is reading his lines off a teleprompter, and his melodramatics remind you of a high school play.Director Len Wiseman is a former art director for several major films, including Stargate, and a director of music videos.  His film does indeed look gorgeous, but that is all there is to it.  The meat is missing, it's just the fancy packaging that is left.",Underworld

It is set in a beautiful, dark and gothic world, with well detailed sets, and even though it takes certain elements from the Matrix, and Blade, it is unique in its own way. First off, the budget was only 30 million. After watching the film, you would think its more like 80 million. The costumes, sets, great stuntwork, wirework, its all here. I also was very impressed by the acting here, especially the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, I hope she is Hollywood's next 20 million dollar actress, she is so talented. I also would like to mention that there is no CGI !! very little Cgi is used in this film. I thought the werewolfs looked great, If your a fan of Aliens, and Pumpkinhead, then take a look at the werewolves in this film. The vampires in the movie appeared to be very weak, and do not follow their legend at all in that they do have reflections, and do grow older in appearance. But hey every vampire movie has its own mythology. I hope They make a sequel to this film, the end shows you that they might make one afterall.

It's just downplayed a large amount which is great.  When you go see a horror movie that is what you want to see.  This film was full of action scenes and kept you wanting more.  I do wish they would of used more kinds of weapons.  The ones they did use had some interesting results however.  I would definitely recommend this movie for lovers of vamps and werewolves alike.  I like the way they show the werewolves change.  Kind of a new faster way than the slow hair growing you might be used to seeing.All in all this is a film that should do well in the box office and may have set itself up nicely for a sequel if the studio so desires.

153,jdring2007,"a stylish, but not over the top, character-driven, vampire vs werewolf action flick with great performances and superb storytelling",9,6 November 2021,"I've seen this movie more time than I can count. As have I indulged in its many sequels, particularly the second and third (a prequel expounding on the narrative and folklore established in this one). But this one remains the star. At the time innovative so far as combining vampire and werewolf, in such a creative and dark way. The lore created for this movie is explained throughout, shown rather than told, avoiding an intro scene of dense exposition seen so often in movies like this. What makes it even better is the prevalence of practical effects over CGI, and the werewolf (excuse me, lycan - a genius move in the writing), transformations are so satisfying. The hybridization of the species was handled brilliantly, too. The subtle stylish shots and moves in the cinematography gave this movie some flair amod the dark, grimy, gritty atmosphere throughout, a vibe that nonetheless pulls you in. My only gripe really is some continuity and tech mistakes, such as Selene's pistols having infinite ammunition. One complaint I usually have with vampire movies is this cloying romantic element, but that's absent here. While there is still some ""sexual tension"" and a deeply rooted romantic theme as you discover by the end, it's so well portrayed and not overwhelming at all. Meanwhile characters are performed with such great evocation, especially Michael Sheen as Lucian. Kate Beckinsale as Selene is at this point iconic, as I would say Bill Nighy as Viktor is absolutely incredible, and Shane Brolly as Kraven shouldn't be overlooked or understated. Even the smaller characters had some draw to them, so unique personality. Be it Sorn, Kahn, or Raze. The action itself is well done but not without its stiffness sometimes. The movie often felt low-budget but I can't be sure. Nonetheless an amazing directorial debut by Len Wiseman. And a brilliant fashion of storytelling using effectively depicted flashbacks, especially now having such an elaboration of the lore available (a story cowritten by both Wiseman and Kevin Grevioux, who played Raze, and powerfully might I add).",Underworld
154,XhoXhuXhamen,Sexiest Vampire Ever,9,17 October 2021,"The reason for this film's success is Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Selene. As the main protagonist in the war between the Vampires and the Lycans, she breathes new life into a stale genre, inevitably played by male actors. The war itself is explained well enough, and the rest of the cast is good enough to fill in the details. The directing is above average. And the sets are D A R K! Thank the Vampire Gods that Hollywood had NOTHING to do with the production. Why? Because they would have destroyed it, just like they've destroyed nearly every other film of this genre.That said, I highly recommend this film.

I'm impressed!,8,4 February 2004,"As soon as I saw the preview to this film I wrote it off as a silly Matrix rip-off trying to attack a subject that is so tired (vampires/werewolves). I really never had any intention of seeing Underworld until my girlfriend, who saw it in theaters, repeatedly suggested I watch it.  After watching the DVD just now I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.  I was completely into the story, which is surprisingly rich and engaging.  One would have to be a bit naïve not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films, most notably The Matrix.  It should be obvious to any free-thinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original, but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more.  This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from.  Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with the Matrix films.  The most refreshing aspect of this movie is the story, which surprisingly has many layers and puts a totally fresh new spin on the vampire/werewolf stories.  This aspect, along with the excellent visual effects makes Underworld an enjoyable experience.  A sequel for this is inevitable, and I must say that I'm really looking forward to it.  Underworld was a very pleasant surprise. *** out of **** stars",Underworld
156,gazineo-1,"Hey, the Monsters are Coming!",6,17 September 2004,"Eletric, atmospheric and relentless action/terror movie in which two races of inhuman creatures, the Lycans (in fact, the old and well known werewolves monsters) and the Vampires fight against each other, in a perpetual battle for mutual extermination, in a cruel and violent war that have been rolling for many centuries. In this particular vision of the world - a vision that brings to mind some RPG's games - a vampire agent (played by the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale) falls in love with a human (Speedman) just to find out that he is a member of the Lycans tribe. In this point, the movie works out with the old theme of a impossible love story but never misses its bull eye: a good action movie. ""Underworld' is not a classic of the genre. There's no term of comparison with some classics as 'Dracula'(1931), 'Werewolf,The' with Lon Chaney or even 'Interview with a Vampire' directed by Neil Jordan and starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.

Here's My Take:Underworld is about the ongoing feud between Lycans and Vampires. The concept alone does have intrigue, but something's missing. What the problem I found was that the story is good, but Underworld is lacking depth.Underworld has some Alex Proyas like style to the movie in a darkness reigns and everlasting rain style. Not that is bad but the action is flawed with simple gun fights nothing more and not much else. Beckinsale is good here as Seline. Speedman is good, but his character is unfocused.Underworld lacks depth, action and emotion. Sure, it looks nice on the outside, but inside, it's none too pretty.

That's pretty much the whole plot right there as the two sides engage in battle after battle. Into the mess steps a human who for ill-explained reasons holds the genetic key that might end the war. So now each side is trying to get him, apparently because they don't want the war to end!! Not much of a story really.Best part of the movie is Kate Beckinsale as one of the main vampires. She is extremely beautiful - maybe too beautiful for this role. She was also the star of Cold Comfort Farm and had a similar impact on that film.

159,The_Orenda,Pointless,4,21 January 2006,"Underworld is, as Bill Nighy once said, one of those movies that has everything in it. At two hours though, the movie is draining to watch and requires multiple viewings to understand the story and the world that is made, essentially, from the ground up by Len Wiseman himself. As a comic book fan, I enjoyed it. As a movie fan, I did not. Most of the movie speaks in riddles, and the curtain opening scene will probably lose many viewers. I really did not enjoy how it played out as a film, but there is something about Underworld that helped me watch it from beginning to end.A six-hundred years war between vampires and werewolves is about to end as the final pieces of a chess game are played between its major players.I think of this film as a pure urban movie. There are many guns, many players, much grit in its choreography. Stylistically, the film is perfect. It's perfect camp and once you piece together the story, it is an enjoyable film altogether. The film stays true to the whole myth of vampires and the Lycans, as the werewolves are called, are exceptionally put together.

Michael Sheen who is also in Frost/Nixon and the sequel and prequel to this is very good as a werewolf.the story basically is about a rivalry between vampires and werewolves. then one day Selene (Kate Beckinsale) finds out a plot the werewolves are planning and it starts a war that ends in carnage.obviously this isn't no classic memorable film but at the end of the day not many vampire films are. if you want a slick action film with good action scenes and good story then check this one out............ 8/10..........j.d Seaton,Underworld

162,extravaluejotter,UnderDone,2,17 April 2006,"I blame the Wachowski Brothers. Ever since The Matrix re-awakened male interest in good-looking, gun-toting laydeez in skin-tight outfits, there's been a stampede of producers looking for a viable geek-porn franchise.Underworld is one of many sub-Matrix beasts. Kate Beckinsale's Selene dresses in Trinity's black latex cast-offs and uses guns for every conceivable purpose apart from brushing her teeth. The 'Secret War, Searching for The Chosen One' plot ticks a few more Matrix boxes and things are rounded off by some gravity-defying stunts.I have to admit that Selene's casual leap off a 100ft ledge, landing like a cat and calmly strolling away is a nicely-executed piece of stunt work, but there isn't much else to recommend this movie.Um, apart from the Lycans. The werewolf makeup is fantastic and the effects really bring these mythical creatures to life.But now, the downside. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful to look at but she is in a state of perma-sulk all the way through Underworld. One day she'll wake up, look back on her movie career and realise that she never acted at all. Admittedly, there isn't much call for serious dramatic acting in a film like Underworld, but that doesn't stop veteran actor Bill Nighy from giving it a go. Bill and Kate are polar opposites in this movie. Nighy manages to present Viktor as a multi-faceted character, so there's a real sense of drama when it's revealed that he's not as honourable and charitable as you first thought. Beckinsale's Selene just pouts and poses her way through the script, woodenly unconvincing and about as sexy as an action figure of herself.Miss Beckinsale is not alone. Scott Speedman, the token American, matches our Kate splinter-for-splinter in the wooden department. Wearing a stock 'Confused' mask for most of the movie, he has all the screen presence and charisma of a wardrobe. At the end of the movie his character is transformed into some sort of uber-vampire-werewolf hybrid, but he still fails to raise any hackles and is acted off the screen by Bill Nighy.I really wanted to like this film, but the sort-of-intriguing plot ended up being subsumed by poor acting and an over-abundance of gun play and dodgy martial arts.

164,xlars,Interesting religio-philosophical allegory.,7,16 January 2014,"The Underworld Quadrilogy is an interesting row of films. The plot and the stories with sequels and prequels aren't all that bad, even though highly illogical. The writers could, though, have scored a few pointers in studying fairy-tales somewhat closer. What really makes this series of films interesting is the religio-philosophical and allegorical idea that lies behind. Now, I will not go deeper into this realm in this review, lest I open the door to a Dantean inferno that I am not willing to enter, nor let others enter into. Thus I will just leave it to others there. Maybe others are willing to pilpul the matter further, and deeper - and end up with some kind of final halakha at some later date in the future. As a final conclusion to this review, I will give the complete series of films an evaluation of 7.

165,guyfromjerzee,Better than I expected,7,16 July 2004,"Whenever I watch movies of this sort, I'm always afraid that I'm going to watch a special effects extravaganza that's all style and no substance.  I honestly feel that a great film can be made without flashy f/x, but as long as the whole feature is not merely a showcase for those f/x, I don't have a problem.  That was the case with ""Underworld.""  Along with the fast-paced action sequences is a well-written story that develops nicely throughout the course of the film.  It is an original spin on the age-old vampire tale.  As one of the co-writers pointed out in an interview, the film is based more on science than folklore.  Therefore, don't expect your usual wooden crosses and stakes through the heart.  The director's intention was to create an action film, only featuring vampires and werewolves (referred to as Lycans). Personally, I still think it falls into the horror genre, but it doesn't follow too many of the cliches of its genre.  The story is hard-to-follow at times, but that's part of what I liked.  I like when a movie challenges me to pay attention and use my brain, rather than insult my intelligence.  So those who are expecting wall-to-wall action, blood and gore might be disappointed.  I think the film's rich storyline is what made it a success. I was impressed to find out it was made for a little over 20 million.  As the director pointed out in the DVD commentary, the budget for this movie is half of what is costed to make the chase sequence in ""Matrix Reloaded.""  So I can't classify this as high-budget trash, because there wasn't even a high budget.  But it's not low-budget trash either.  It's funny how I just read a review complaining about the film's cheesy ""CGI effects.""  There was hardly any CGI!  Most of the effects are practical, which is refreshing in a day and age where directors seem to live and die by CGI (hey, it rhymes!).  Kate Beckinsale makes a great heroine, and brings a nice element of class to the film.  Plus, seeing her roam around in a tight rubber suit didn't cause any complaints on my part.  Boy, is she beautiful!  And for the ladies, there's Scott Speedman who brings a nice vulnerability to his role.  It's a lot more impressive than his flat performance in ""Dark Blue.""  I loved the whole look of the film.  It almost appears film-noirish.  If you want to see a horror movie that delivers and isn't full of cliches, you'll be in for a treat.  (7 out of 10)",Underworld
166,davidemartin,A heckuva good flick,10,19 September 2003,"Maybe I'm getting jaded in my middle age but I don't quite get as wrapped up in flicks as I used to.Not so with UNDERWORLD.  This is a very engaging flick.  Sure, it's evocative of Matrix and its clones but you know what?  Here's a case where a second-generation flick is BETTER than the ones that inspired it!Maybe the secret of UNDERWORLD's success is that it is NOT a Hollywood flick?  The team of Brit, German, and Hungarian filmmakers have succeeded in making a big budget, FX-heavy flick that does not have the oppressive obnoxiousness of flicks like The Matrix or the incredibly awful Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (the REAL Worst IMDB flick of all time!). Hidden away in Hungary, the filmmakers were free to make an interesting flick and not have to deal with studio execs and focus groups.I agree there is not a lot of overt character development.  But what there is is subtle and nicely done.  Michael, for example, is shown as a caring person even during the subway shootout.  This IS the guy who will bring an end to the persecution of the downtrodden werewolves, despite being drawn unwilling into their conflict.  Selene is withdrawn, literally dead inside because of her centuries-old grief for her family.  Had she been wisecracking or even smiling, THAT would have been out of character. Victor is a truly scary depiction of a noble yet ruthless superbeing. Hopefully directors, writers, and stars of more tradition comic book flicks to come will take note, learn, and finally give a real performance rather than just do a Nicholson ham job. One note about Selene's bodysuit--  it's 35 years since Diana Rigg set the model.  Nice to see it carried on.",Underworld
167,Zombified_660,Vampires + Werewolves + Lots of guns= Fun.,9,24 August 2005,"As far as action horrors go, Underworld is only really topped by a few A* grade movies like Versus and Aliens. The combination of intricate Hollywood style gunplay and a crazed drive-in style story about a war between vampires and werewolves goes down an absolute treat as far as I'm concerned. Add into this great turns from all of the cast, and the movie starts to fly just as a concept.The execution lives up to the idea for once. Bullets fly, werewolves leap and vampires wail with both great energy and solidity. Underworld has a real grounded feel that helps avoid it losing its way in self parody like the painful Van Helsing. It also looks gorgeous, all washed out blues and Gothic architecture, managing to be both convincingly urban and thrillingly dark at the same time.It's had more than its fair share of detractors, but personally Underworld is one of my favourite action/horror films, and it's never a chore to watch it, despite it's somewhat indulgent length. If you haven't seen this yet, you're missing out.",Underworld

Directed by Len Wiseman.Underworld overall was a pitiful vampire movie. The raining champ of the bloodsuckers is non-other than Blade. Aside from the sexy Beckinsale this movie did nothing for me. The battle scenes seemed overrated and lame; I didn't want vampires to have guns they should have fell from the sky and ripped out someone's neck.A war is brewing between Vampires and Werewolves. Selene (Beckinsale) is a Werewolf hunter who well shoots them down. Until she meets Michael Corvin (Speeman), who wants to stop the war before it starts.The movie was sold short it had no good dialogue between the characters, and the action scenes were entertaining at most. The best part for me was Beckinsale running around in that tight black leather. Almost like a Catwoman suite. My final rating 4/10.",Underworld
169,clydestuff,Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee,6,19 February 2004,"In the opening moments of this film we get a voice over narration by Selene played by Kate Beckinsale.  It's a nice looking well photographed scene, and it grabs are attention.  Unfortunately, in this opening monologue, we also get a lot of vague mumble jumbo attempting to explain who Selene is, what she's doing and why.  By the time the narration is finished we don't have anymore of a clue as to what's going on then we did as we entered the theater.  And that as just about how it goes for the entire length of Underworld.Don't fret though, eventually you'll discover through a certain amount of diligence that this is the story about the Vampires and the Lycans, or werewolves if you will.  Think Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee and you pretty much have the picture.  We also know that the Vampires have spent years trying to do in the Lycans and have been quite successful at it.  It seems that Selene discovers the Lycans are after a certain human named Michael Corvin(Scott Speedman).  They need to mix his blood with theirs for reasons that are never quite clear.  It also turns out that after tracking down Michael on her own, Selene finds herself attracted to him.  We know this only because of the way the plot develops, not because of any kind of emotional response offered by Selene.  Of course she is a vampire and chances are she isn't supposed to have any romantic notions, but if she doesn't have any emotions....well, I don't want to convolute an already polluted film any more than it is.There's also a lot of other stories told to us during Underworld.  There are more monologues in this film explaining background and motives than any film in recent memory.  My best advice to you is if you watch this film, be prepared to draw a chart as these many explanations are rattled off because you'll sure need one.  There's a story about why and how Selene became a vampire, there's a story about why Michael is being hunted by the Lycans, there's a story about why two vampire leaders sleep for years and only one is awakened at a time, there's a story about why bullets are taken out of the Lycans and put back in.  After a while I felt like I should go to the book store and buy the Cliff Notes.  There are so many stories and so many explanations, and most of them are so convoluted and long winded that it's impossible to follow this film without being overcome by long periods of boredom.A lot of what is on the screen looks good.  The battle scenes between the Lycans and the Vampires are all well done and interesting to look at.  The sets are adequately foreboding and photographed in the kind of prevalent bluish haze that seems to have overtaken the film world in the last few years.  We do look at the battle and attack scenes in a passive kind of way because Underworld has complicated it's plot and background to an extent that we really don't care about who the good guys are or the bad guys are or whatever.  We are never given a chance to be drawn into this story and none of the performances here help.  I don't care if this is a film about the supernatural, there is not one performance in this film that is more than one note.  Beckinsale certainly looks OK in her leather outfit, and she performs the action scenes well enough, but does nothing at any point to make us care about her or help draw us into her story.  Speedman's human character of Michael is no better.  We don't feel any sympathy, fear, or anything about him because after two hours you won't know him as a person any better than you did when he makes his first appearance. 
If you take the time to watch Underworld, you might appreciate the action scenes, the dark settings, and several scenes of modern day werewolves and vampires battling it out.  As for myself I've only got one thing to ask, ""Where's my copy of Dracula vs. The Wolf Man?""My Grade: C-",Underworld
170,travisimo,What in the World?!,5,21 January 2004,"Many questions arise when watching Underworld.  (1) What are lycans?  (2) Who are deathdealers?  But most confusingly, (3) who in the world is Scott Speedman??!  Underworld answers some of these questions and reveals the plot way too far into the movie.  The first two-thirds of Underworld is devoted to shooting, killing, biting, and some chitchat that makes little sense because none of the plot is revealed.For my father, and I think for many moviegoers, Underworld takes so long to make sense that there's little reason to stick around.  However, I toughed it out, and after about 90 minutes, I saw a glimpse of a story unfolding. The story is fairly interesting as we're told how this whole mess started, but it took way too long to get to that point.  The actors were unrecognizable before and after this movie (except it was fun to see Kate Beckinsale in that leather outfit).  The action sequences were commendable, but may be a little overkill (especially the ending with a very silly death of one of the main characters).Underworld reminds me of the time my friends dragged me to see Blade 2.  I had no real interest in seeing that movie and am really not a fan of vampire/werewolf movies.  After seeing Blade 2, I was not swayed, but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  I think Underworld will do the same for fans of those types of movies.  However, for the average, recreational moviegoer like myself, Underworld is just going to fly over your head.My IMDb Rating: 5/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: C+ (Flawed but Worthy)",Underworld
171,brandon_lee420,I just wasted my time.....,8,10 January 2010,"...making a hamburger while I missed out on a great Vampire-Lycan movie that stars Kate Beckinsale as the Vampire Selene. I took the disc out and inserted it again while my sister was telling me that I suck sh*t. The movie was great, it had plenty of action, scares, fights, and great special effects. Bill Nighy gives the best performance in this movie as he portrays a Vampire that goes by the name of Viktor along side his Vampire-daughter Kate Beckinsale A.K.A Selene. Scott Speedman could have done better but he was still alright while Sophie Myles sucked big turd. Vampire lovers will definitely like this movie and the same with Lycan (Werewolf) lovers. It tells a story of a war that has raged on for centuries between Vampires and their one-time slaves the Lycans. The battles are brutal, hardcore, full of energy, and very stylish. I have to give two thumbs up to the special effects guys and the makeup artists. The Vampires need to be all white and cold and the makeup artists have done that really good. The special effects guys were really neat when the humans change into Lycans and they looked cool and Lycan-like. Len Wiseman has directed a great movie with some flaws that get bigger and bigger as the movie progresses. The picture for Underworld looks really creative because you can see Selene (Vampire) stand on the ledge and in the background you can see a Lycan (on the moons surface. The film has a dark atmosphere that engulfs you and gives you a great good movie type of feeling. I strongly suggest that you don't eat popcorn during the movie because you will likely throw up at the person nearest to you and vice versa.Selene, a Vampire, fights Lycans through night like many other Vampires. It's when she meets Michael, a hybrid of both species, and falls in love with him and later she struggles to stop the unnecessary war. Fighting through her own kind as well as Lycans, she has to protect Michael from dying because he is the only one who can settle this.The battles are purely fantastic and it never disappoints. The sound through the battles are amazing and they make the battles a little bit better. The story is excellent but sometimes is a little tiny bit slow. The battles that are the best are in the end with Michael in his hybrid form fighting Vampires. Surround sound will make the viewing a little bit better. Don't think about buying this because you won't watch this everyday, renting is much smarter. Underworld is great and the sequels are necessary but the third one is totally a waste of money. We know what's going to happen anyway because they tell us this in this film. Underworld is so good it will have your blood boiling to maximum temperature (am I exaggerating?). The script is pretty exceptional but a little bit more work could have been done on it. Overall, this is a enjoyable film that will work for some and not so for others. As I said, Renting will be better.",Underworld

173,SimonHeide,Worst cinematic experience in a very long time.,1,19 January 2008,"I really think that this movie was made for young, self-centered people with no knowledge of the vampire lore. It made me furious to watch Selene as I saw her as a very narcissistic person who constantly was too aware of her own appearance. It made me feel like I was watching somebody up on the catwalk each time I saw her. The way she jumped, walked, shot with her guns and the way she looked from under her hair. I was so annoyed. Completely without any kind of character. It has been stated that she falls in love with Michael Corvin but that is something we have to deduce from the fact that she kisses him. I didn't see any affection, tenderness or soft spoken words between them. She is just too hollow.So much from the vampire lore was omitted that it felt really weird. What had become of their demonic nature, why didn't they drink blood and, as others have pointed out, how come that they cast a shadow? As we learn, they are still vulnerable to sun-light, but there isn't any during the whole film.Were we supposed to feel any sympathy for either side in the conflict? I didn't at all and basically I think that if you do not engage yourself in the protagonist then the movie has failed seriously. The only thing I was hoping for was, that everybody ended up killing each other.I don't think that I will spoil anything by saying, that there will be a show-down in the end. Let me just say that they should really, really have used a stand-in/stunt-man for poor old Viktor. So in order to make this film a good experience you really have to stop thinking and just drift with it - and this was simply impossible for me.regards SimonPs.

174,mgmax,"Beckinsale surprisingly good, male leads surprisingly bad",3,21 February 2005,"The pleasant surprise is that Kate Beckinsale in black leather and stringy hair is surprisingly game and credible as an vampire butt-kicking killer. The unpleasant surprise is that the male leads of this picture are, almost uniformly, godawful-- costar and love interest Speedman is a total block of lead, a Michael Lembeck for our time, while bad guy Brolly is unintentionally hilarious every time he scrunches up his mouth in a widdle-bitty pout and tries to be menacingly evil. Even Bill Nighy, who has done some good things, is a bland choice for the middle-aged King of the Vamps, he looks like Mr. Greenjeans in Halloween makeup, and proves a pale shadow of the character who probably inspired his casting, Corin Redgrave in the brilliant British vampire miniseries Ultraviolet. (Only Michael Sheen, recently seen as a swishy sort in Bright Young Things, doesn't embarrass himself.) All in all, this is a dull, backstory-heavy muddle with little to recommend it. Naturally, a sequel is on the way.",Underworld
175,mwendel,I really enjoyed this film (possible spoilers),7,23 September 2003,"This film was not what I expected.  I truly expected a knock down drag out end-to-end attempt by vampires and werewolves to annihilate each other with big explosions, unbelievable fight scenes and over the top special effects. Is that what everyone does these days?Instead, there actually was a decent surprisingly unpredictable story with good sub plots and a very gothic ambiance.  I think all of them might have been a little bit under developed, or maybe they were lopped off to bring the length of the movie down; I guess we will have to wait for a director's cut to find out.The story does have some surprising plot twists, which you may or may not be able, to figure out until they actually happen- thankfully, in my opinion, they were not telegraphed.  Another notable element is that vampires in this story don't turn into bats, fog or rats, they're just people afflicted with a virus as are the werewolves.  Which is one of the different strains (no pun intended) of the supernatural/horror genre that's from a more scientific than mystical influence.The technical special effects, thankfully, were not ridiculously overdone and made in such a way to blend very well into the film.  It seemed like a lot of detail went into doing the effects that were used, rather sparingly, which I felt lent more credible to the movie as a story than a wide screen goth-horror-action explosion.I think the characters were intriguing, although knowing a little more about them might have been interesting, especially Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) - we know in the end what his ties to both the vampires and the werewolves is, but we really don't know much about him other than that he was a resident at a hospital.  For Selene (Kate Beckingsdale) you don't need to know much because basically she's been doing what she's been doing for several hundred years and her character is basically unchanged - she's a warrior and a survivor who follows her instincts for better or worse.It would have been more interesting to find out how the deal that spared Kraven's (Shane Brolly) life actually occurred as that is on of the major catalysts to how the story unfolds.  The only other thing I would have really like to have found out about, was the hierarchical structure of the vampire world because it appeared very complex and sophisticated.  Whereas, it appears that the werewolves have little to no structure at all and that which they have is all through the mechanizations of Lucian (Michael Sheen).But if I say more, I may give too much away, if I haven't already.  I think this movie is worth seeing.  The sets are good, the weapon's tech is very cool and all in all it's a movie that has a slightly different beat than most of what we've seen this year.",Underworld
176,boondocksaint20,In a word...wow...,9,20 September 2003,"Forget the Matrix Reloaded...if you want a dark, leather trenchcoat clad movie, dripping with coolness from bloody fangs, then Underworld is your movie.  Far too many movies I've seen over the years have promising trailers, but fail to deliver.  This is why I was hoping that this movie would deliver, and I was pleased to find out that it most certainly did.Great performances all around and spectacular special effects (save for a few sub par CGI moments) really makes the story flow nicely.  Speaking of which, yes, this movie actually has a story!  As sad as that may sound about most Hollywood movies of recent times, this movie has a great, engaging story that is coherent as it is interesting.  Quite a change from the confusing plotlines of Matrix Reloaded and other films that have come out this year.  The plot is excellent, and is explained well throughout.  Any times where you may be scratching your head are cleared up usually a scene later, which I cannot say about other movies I have seen recently in the theater that opt to leave holes in the plot that remain unanswered.This movie is a combination of The Matrix, Blade and Romeo and Juliet.  You have two feuding families of vampires and werewolves, whose only purpose is to eradicate the other...and oh yeah, they wear cool, dark outfits and sport state of the art weaponry (I thought the werewolves' bullets that contained sunlight in them was by far the coolest).  You also have the talented and insanely hot Kate Beckinsale as the lead, kicking fierce butt.  Her performance was by far the best of all, and you can feel her character's torment throughout.  Save for one very bad actor, who sadly is a major character in the film, every other performance is excellent, and adds to the gothic darkness that is the setting of this movie.  And of course, the special effects (especially the werewolves) were among the best I've ever seen.The only thing I wanted more from this movie was a little more character development.  Though the actors do an incredible job of making their characters realistic as if popping out of the pages of a graphic novel, the script, unfortunately, did not supply enough background on many on the support characters...but, there is still enough background to give them depth, and to give a damn when one of them gets dispatched.  Also, almost every character does have a secret motive for his/her actions which adds to the story.  But, that is truly my only complaint with the movie, that there could have been a little more backstory to each character...otherwise, this has been the best movie of the year by far, in my opinion.  This is an exciting movie with great performances, dark, gothic set pieces, non-stop action and one of the best stories I have seen in a movie in a long time.  I highly recommend Underworld...it truly does come close to giving the original Matrix a run for its money.  9/10 stars.",Underworld

From seeing the trailer I expected to see that too.Though this film is mostly made with an extreme amount of clichés, one put after the other. There are so many things in this movie that you've seen before that, after a while, you start to believe that you've seen the actual film earlier.The movie is predictible, boring and actually not interesting at all.The story behind this is good. Very good actually.

It's so goth that it's silly.Some of the actors and actresses have their moments. But working with a screenplay like this can't be easy. The director and the writer are clearly not movie-material people. They can't direct and they can't write. It shows clearly in the very uninspired direction, making the movie feel very flat.
Where some of the film is very sloppy edited, leaving us with questions, some parts of the film is so too explanationary that it feels like they're telling a story for 3-year olds.If this story had been given a better treatment from a talented writer and then that script had been given to a real director, then this film might have been really good.

178,lopcar1993,One of the best Action-Horror films ever made !,7,26 January 2009,"Underworld put's a whole new spin on the vampire/Lycan story line and takes us to a world the likes we've never seen before. Underworld stars Kate Beckinsale as Selene, a beautiful and ruthless vampire assassin(Know as death dealer's)) she has hated the Lycans for as long as she has lived, know Selene and the other death dealers have hunted the lycans to the brink of extinction. Or so they believe. Underworld is a sleek and stylish horror thriller that is sure to captivate and amaze, it doesn't matter how many times you seen it. Kate Beckinsale does an amazing job in the movie you can't stop watching. Underworld blends a sort of Gothic, graphic novel feel to it. It's like the film ""Sin City"", except a little less sinful. This film uses a style that didn't become overly popular until such movies as ""Sin City"" or ""The Dark Knight"" but stands on it's own two feet with the dark and mysterious theme to it. Very few horror films can ever follow this style; or even live up to the style of this film, because it's so unique and different that you can't do anything but love it even those who say they hated it secretly own a copy of this film and don;t want anyone to know. That's what it is, it's a film that you don't tell anyone you've seen and if you have you say you hate it when you secretly love it. This is a guilty pleasure film, and a excellent one at that.

179,jake-179,Disappointing and Boring,3,22 September 2003,"Two of my favorite genres are action and horror, and considering UNDERWORLD was werewolves vs. vampires, I did not expect to be falling asleep in the theatre!  I could hardly keep my eyes open!  This movie was a big disappointment for me.  The previews made it look action packed.  But in reality, the movie was overlong and only had a couple of action sequences. Don't go to this movie expecting to see MATRIX type action or something like BLADE.  BLADE and THE MATRIX are millions of times better than UNDERWORLD and UNDERWORLD is not even in the same class.It's a real shame, because I think UNDERWORLD had a lot of potential.  I am sure most people who saw the movie would agree with me.
The movie was shot well.  The production design was great and the overall look of the film was fantastic.  But the script fell short.  There was a lack of tension in the movie.  The audience does not really care for any of the characters.  The ""love"" story between Selene and Michael was non-existent.  They fall in love with eachother after only meeting for a few seconds.  And, in that time, Selene constantly has a gun in Michael's face. Ridiculous.  Also, there is no RISING ACTION in the movie.  The writers failed to RAISE THE STAKES.  That is a basic element of good screen writing, and it is absent in this movie.  And for the most part, none of the characters are developed.  There are two characters in particular that really annoyed me.  First, Kraven was terrible.  I will be amazed if the actor who played Kraven EVER works in a real film again.  Through out the entire movie, he is trying to act ""intense"" and ""angry."" But he just constantly breathes heavily through his nose!  He didn't convince me at all!  The other character that really bugged was that black guy who was the werewolf with the SUPER deep voice. That was just silly.  Obviously, they are trying to test him out as another counterpart to Vin Diesel.  Vin has a low voice, but the joker in UNDERWORLD sounds like a cartoon character.  He was trying to be all serious and everytime he opened his mouth I was laughing out loud!  You really have to hear this guy's voice to appreciate how stupid it sounds.  You can't hardly even understand him.  But believe me, it isn't worth sitting through the entire movie just to hear this stupid guy's voice.  Just take my word for it, it is silly. The movie is technically done pretty well.  It is definitely a case of atmosphere over substance.  I really wanted to like this movie, I really expected to be thrilled by this movie, but instead I was just bored.  I will go watch BLADE 1 and 2 again.  But in closing, I must comment on Kate Beckinsale and how she is incredibly HOT!  She is very hot.  And even though the movie was boring, at least I got to look at her most of the time.  She looks better when she is not all gothed up.",Underworld

I wanted to like this movie - I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale and I always like a movie where the women kick ass, but this was too gory and too relentless for me. They threw in some plot toward the end, but by then, I was too bored to care - how many different ways can you show a sharp implement entering a body? I know that's endlessly entertaining for some, but I expected more from this.

182,Teknofobe70,Surprisingly Good ...,6,6 April 2005,"The writing team of a stuntman, a gargantuan actor and a prop assistant probably doesn't seem like a group who could lovingly craft a Gothic mini-masterpiece about vampire and werewolves, and actually get it made. But they did.That team was Danny McBride, Kevin Grevioux and director Len Wiseman. They pitched the story as ""Romeo and Juliet, for vampires and werewolves"", which is interesting as the romance angle of the story is barely even existence except for a few moments here and there. What it really is would be more like ""the Matrix with vampire and werewolves"", although they're probably sick of hearing that by now. But to be honest, they don't even try to hide the similarities. It opens with a shoot-out in a subway station, almost identical in visual style to the Matrix, and for no apparent reason it even has those weird electronic sound effects. Is this movie set inside a virtual reality as well? But by copying the Matrix, it does make itself an undeniably cool action movie. Probably the best thing about it is the design of the creatures and the locations it's shot at. The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brilliant. The vampires are portrayed as a decadent, sensual race living in the lap of luxury, while the Lycans are brutal, animalistic and live in squalor -- and you don't see a single female werewolf.The script certainly has it's short-comings but on the whole is fairly well-structured and intricate, with the politics and mythology of the universe coming through loud and clear (even if it is a rip-off of White Wolf's role playing games). It's all very well executed, and you can tell they had a lot of fun making it. Kate Beckinsale does give a great performance, constantly conveying emotion with the slightest of facial expressions. Michael Sheen is also notable as the lycanthropic leader, and Scott Speedman and Bill Nighy both fill their roles competently.""Underworld"" wisely markets itself as an action movie rather than a horror movie.

But then I saw it and you will be shocked and amazed because it's a battle between Licons and Vampires. When I was seeing the movie I thought the Vampires were the good guys, but then I learned that know-one is the good or bad guys. But I think the Vampires were actual bad because they stared the war, it all stared in the Vampires place. The Licons were slaves of the Vampires and one persons from each side had sex and the girl Vampire was per-gent, but her father was mad. So he killed his own daughter and the man Licon was angry and told the rest not to take it any-more. So now their was a war and a lot of action was happening on fighting over a teenage boy who became half Vampire and half Licons. And great sequel at the end when the second in command gets alive, and we know their is another part so I can't wait.",Underworld
185,filmbuff-36,"Action monster movie with lots going on, but nothing happening",5,25 September 2003,"Is it just me, or are vampires not  allowed to be monsters anymore at the cineplex? Tortured souls longing for some form of salvation? Yeah. Entrepreneurs with an supernatural edge over the competition? Sure. Members of extended clans and families that spawn across the ages, hidden in secrecy in order to survive? Absolutely.But vicious, bloodthirsty demons who seek to corrupt the world with cheap promises of pleasure and who feed off the fear of others? Not likely. I suppose we have the success of Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"" series to thank/blame for this, and with it the new mind set that being a vampire, although having a few drawbacks, is still pretty cool.Although it never verbally acknowledges this, that statement seems to be present in every frame of ""Underworld."" Vampires live lives of exorbitant wealth in gothic mansions, wearing full body leather suits and driving fast Mercedes Benzes. No more lurking in drafty castles for these creatures of the night -- if it doesn't have a multi-million dollar ballroom full of vampires seemingly just lounging around all day, then it can't be home.Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a member of a special class of vampires known as ""Death Dealers"" whose job is to hunt down and terminate werewolves with extreme prejudice. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting for centuries it seems, and Selene enjoys her job of taking out the competition. Fighting has severely decimated the werewolf ranks, which is fortunate since the time is drawing near to reawaken a noble vampire who will seemingly bring about the final destruction of the werewolf race.Trouble soon arises however when Selene discovers her lupine enemies are shadowing a seemingly normal human, hospital intern Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). She soon intervenes, taking Michael hostage after saving him from the werewolf's leader Lucian, who is supposed to be dead. Selene's quest to discover the truth about Michael's role in the werewolf plot places some of her already shady superiors in an even more suspicious light, and puts both Selene and Michael in serious danger.Whoa! Catch all that? Don't worry, you won't have to worry about plot all that much. What people really came to see is Selene whipping out dual 9 mm automatics and emptying countless silver-tipped rounds into her werewolf adversaries, which happens in abundance in this film. The werewolves also pack heat that bears ammunition with concentrated ultraviolet light inside, and since vampires and sunlight don't mix...For those hoping for a film featuring werewolf/vampire hand-to-hand combat, however, prepare to be disappointed. The modern day Nosferatus and wolfmen are all trigger happy gunman, relying mostly on firepower instead of brute strength to do battle.That perhaps speaks the most about ""Underworld"" and films of its kind. This is not a horror film, rather it's an action movie with monsters in it. There are definitely some gross werewolf attacks with horrific mutilations and the like, and the monsters definitely look intimidating, but scary? Hardly -- and for a supposed horror film that can be the unkindest cut of all.""Underworld"" is a comic book style movie heavy in the film noir, with all the characters inhabiting some unnamed gothic city shrouded in darkness and gloom. It looks like the filmmakers watched ""Blade Runner"" and ""Dark City"" numerous times prior to filming, and the result is a story that takes place in a murky and depressing universe where happiness seems neither available nor desired.Beckinsale makes a sexy femme fatale but she can't quite bring her character Selene to life. She's all presence but no sympathy; a woman trying to invoke all the cool scenes from ""The Matrix"" while lacking the human core. Speedman also goes through the motions as Michael, a man thrust into the middle of a centuries-old blood feud and forced to just nod in agreement or turn his head away in disgust whenever some other character on screen speaks. His purpose in the film is only cursory. He's a living MacGuffin for the vampires and werewolves to fight over.First time director Len Wiseman films ""Underworld"" like a music video, with stylish slow motion shootouts, pulsating generic techno music and wardrobes seemingly thrown together from an Armani fashion show. The result is too much leather, gun blasts and needless eye candy for the brain to comprehend.Ultimately, the movie is two hours of unappealing characters snarling and fighting over who should rule a dreary and lifeless world -- something that might work as a video game scenario, but throw it up on the big screen and the pointlessness of the whole enterprise shines like a beacon.This movie a least proves that bloodsuckers and lycanthropes are still staples of the horror genre, but I suggest you watch ""Near Dark"" or ""The Howling"" if you want to see novel presentations of the vampire and werewolf communities. Here they're just members of rival gangs fighting over turf, with very little imagination thrown in to make the story unique or interesting.5 out of 10 stars. The movie is all dressed up with nowhere to go.",Underworld
186,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Underworld,6,20 September 2003,"`But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Rise up, beautiful sun, and make the jealous moon invisible.'One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a `Death Dealer', an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being `loosely' based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like Once Upon a Time in Mexico.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C+)",Underworld

(Now *there's* an idea - a production of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING with a leather-clad Hero . . . hmmm).More style over substance - similar to EQUILIBRIUM in that respect, although that film had a little more plot and possibly fewer bullets - although it's hard to tell when you get up in the thousands.A few plot twists along the way but mostly special effects and *sigh* Kate.",Underworld
189,Jim-Eadon,Bad doggie!,3,1 February 2004,"Underworld pitches dim Vampires against dopey Werewolves in a modern day Blade-like, urban (yawn) nighttime setting. I know a movie about light-shunning beasts shouldn't be particularly sunshiny, but the relentless darkness of Underworld, punctuated by cold, feeble illumination, becomes depressing, like an entire winter's blues crushed into an hour and a half.Generally speaking, vampire movies, by their very nature, are sexy: the penetration of the neck is nothing if not symbolic. Shame Underworld has had every last vestige of red eroticism drained out from its twitching corpse. We enter into a sexless place, damp and sans pleasure.The scenery, though limited, is gothic and elaborate: sets lit by long shadows of curved menace. Yet the script was blandly modern and functional. A vampire is told, ?you were awoken one hundred years before schedule?, or some such, as if he were being told he was early for some rainy Monday morning meeting. This vanquished any kind of spell Underworld held over me: it was as if the scri were drawn up by undead bean counters, which generally seems to be the case these days.Kate Beckinsale is a beautiful lass, beyond the compare of most mortals. Yet here, clad in tight black leather, she seemed frigid and almost androgynous. She reminded me in many ways of Trinity ?out of? the Matrix. Trinity is a remarkably sexy woman, as one realises from watching Memento. But, in that modern way, Trinity has the sex appeal of a rat in a bin bag. Perhaps it is just me, not finding these women wrapped in black leather curiously sexless, but more likely, the fault lies with the director. Why is the audience considered by movie makers as a vacuum to be filled with violence, but not a mote of eroticism? Many modern movies, especially the specimen of a sexless vampire movie, is the modern day equivalent of the Victorians covering table legs to avoid offence. Political correctness is probably at least partially behind this malaise. Yawwwwwwwn!So, there's no decent dialogue, sex, nudity or sexiness to be found here, what about action then? Again, we are given precious little gratification here. There are a few fights but they are not particularly sensational or invigorating. The fights felt false. Worse, because I didn't care about ANY of the characters, I didn't care who won. The characters of Underworld seem like hibernating cold blooded creatures; deathless amphibians. The werewolves were too poorly lit to be admired, but too blatant to be mysterious.Underworld is terrifically tedious. This move is another debacle that causes one to question the recent fad with casting a female in the lead role in an action movie. The blazing Lara Croft pistols in delicate hands bullshit is really wearing thin.Oh, and did I mention that at one point the gal says, ""I've gottagettyouOuddahere!"" Groan?

190,vvanpo,Gothic Soap Opera,6,18 October 2003,"""Underworld"" posits the notion that vampires and lycans (werewolves) have a long, lurid history together.  It's a soap of backstabbing (and graphic frontstabbing for that matter) and hidden agendas revolving around a human who clashes their histories violently asunder.The movie is a lot of style but not much substance.  Dark and rainy nights, bounteous leather painted in greys and blood red.  I found it to be middling.  The only thing that sticks in my mind about it is how almost all the characters in it are non-human.  The special man I alluded to before doesn't remain human for long.

I wasn't bored for a second, and the story line was solid, contrary to what I had heard from the intellectually challenged. This film has great sound effects, too.

Vampires also follow this man and want the helps of their ancestor. While doing that, director uses too less colours and the story almost passes in places like the underground.I rarely examined the forums about this film and I am of the opinion that it is nonsense like most people said.

194,mrspasm,Sexy Becksy!,8,7 September 2009,"Ever since Buffy came along and made everything cool again we have had an influx of three separate related things: 1. Movies starring a strong, independent female kick ass character (Aliens, Valley of The Dolls, Underworld). 2. Cool vampire movies with cool characters and cool vampires (Blade, Razor Blade Smile, Underworld). 3. Movies and shows which blend horror and comedy creating what I call 'Hilarious Screamers', such as Scream, Ugly Betty, and Underworld. Now, underworld is slightly different in that is disbands the humour and plays everything very straight laced (and leather clad). Most hilarious screamers aren't very funny anyway and it is probably a good idea that this is more like an action drama horror. Everything is dark and cool, rainy and gloomy, blue and atmospheric.Kip Beckinsale plays a vampire who has been at war with Werewolves (the technical terms is lichen) for centuries- since the time of The Vikings and when there used to be Greeks. She is one of many, working day and night (apart from day time) to stop the war boiling over into human land. One day a man is accidentally bitten by a werewolf and will turn in a few days. However, there is something special about his blood or something and he is able to waken an ancient vampire monster who will end the world. The plot was very complexicated and I can't really remember too much. To be honest I was too busy googling at Baxendale's chests in her leather. The story never really matters in films anyway, as long as there are plenty of guns and killing, and perhaps some excitements then it is a classic masterpiece. There is lots of action here, with guns, steaks, vampire vs werewolf fights, chases etc. The graphics are very nice too, better than the computer game. Beckinsdale is a good vampire, but I think that Buffy would beat her up in a normal fight. She is only a normal vampire with ordinary powers, and considering Buffy has beaten The Master, Dracula, Glory (a God!) and hundreds of uber-vamps, I don't think Becks would have a chance. She does have lots of guns though, but in a straight fight that would be cheating. Overall this is a nice film to watch after a Sunday roast- just don't have too much garlic or the TV might switch itself off! Incrementally, the film is named after the knicker making factory from Coronation Street- The Director's favourite show! Best Scene: I liked the way Backonsale jumped off rooftops onto the streets below.

196,Tresix,Outmatrixes THE MATRIX,8,16 September 2003,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, the first thing that ran through my mind: ""THE MATRIX with fangs"".  Leather trenchcoats, large-caliber automaticfirearms, wirework fight scenes.   I received a pass for an advance screening and went, not expecting too much.  I must say, after seeing the movie, I waspleasantly surprised.  UNDERWORLD was everything that THE MATRIXWISHES it could have been.    The movie basically continues a feud that wasshown in the movie THE HOWLING VI:  THE FREAKS:  vampires andwerewolves do not get along.  They have been warring for over a millennium. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire known as a ""death dealer"", sheespecially trained to kill lycans:  Werewolves.  The leader of the lycans, Lucian (Michael Sheen), has been killed. Or so we are led to believe.   It turns out that not only is he alive, but he is tracking a young man (Scott Speedman) who is a descendant of a man who is supposed to have the blood of both lycans andvampires flowing through him.  Selene  is also trying to get to Michael(Speedman) before Lucian.  As fate would have it, Michael is being hunted ataround the same time that  Viktor (Bill Nighy), the leader of the vampires, is going to be resurrected.    This isn't sitting too well with Kraven (Shane Brolly), the current leader.  He'd just as soon kill Michael as try to find out the plans that Lucian have for him.       The fight scenes are pretty impressive as is the unique ammo that each side uses to exploit the other's weaknesses such as bullets that emit ultraviolet rays inside of a vampire's body and others that are loaded with silver nitrate to get into a lycan's bloodstream quicker.

Sets are ugly. Kate Beckinsale in leather? Yawn. There is lot of action and posing, but no style, fun or atmosphere. And that's the point of the vampire/werewolf movies, right? Be entertaining? Of course Kate get to do lot of action scenes, and after all, every run-of-the-mill action movie features such heroines so the Hollywood actresses can say: ""It is really surprising to see a film like this - with a strong woman!"" But her character does not seem a vampire at all. Sorry, but vampires should be a bit more vampiric. And better dressers. She just run around in her Matrix-inspired wardrobe shooting and killing werewolves like a female reject from John Woo movie. Believe me, I did not expected to see some pretentious artsy crap.

199,alecwest,Criticism ... but not of the film itself,10,28 May 2004,"I must admit that I was prepared to see just one more vampire and/or werewolf film filled with wanton blood and gore.  Instead, I was left in both awe and circumspection.The filmgoer has become so used to the ""2-hour-format"" (give or take a few minutes) that films which don't please them within that format are panned. But, this film like others (ie., 1984's ""Dune"") appeared to be better suited to a 4-hour or longer format ... spread over 2 separate films, perhaps.  In short, attributing weaknesses of this film to acting or writing might be unfair.  To me, the weaknesses seem more attributed to editing or perhaps budget constraints put upon the production company.This film would have had all the earmarks of epic quality had it been filmed as an epic.  But epics are rarely crammed into a 2-hour timeslot with success.  The acting by largely unknown actors was riveting and allowed me to suspend disbelief entirely.  The camera work was breathtaking.  And the choreography of battle scenes was on par with or better than that found in ""The Matrix"" trilogy.I gave this film a 10-out-of-10 rating on effort alone, despite my reservations over the rushed nature of the storyline which detracted from a filmgoer's ability to appreciate it more fully.",Underworld
200,Rooster99,Terrific action picture!,8,7 January 2004,"I can't believe they were able to put this together for only 23 million. Puts many movies with vastly superior budgets to shame!  (someone actually okayed the 120 million for Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle, perhaps the worst action movie ever made).  Great special effects, good action sequences, a story that moves at a smart pace (though is occasionally predictable), and a thoroughly enjoyable experience.********MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****************There are some aspects of the plot which may require reflection however. For instance, the vampires seem ridiculously easy to kill (like in Blade), whereas the werewolves appear to be immensely difficult.  Even after being shot in the head 3 times with silver bullets, Lucian does a lot of flexing and simply pops them out (how many times do you have to shoot them to kill them then?).  The werewolves (Lycans) use ultraviolet bullets against the vampires, however when Selene sets out to kill the lead vampire, she merely slices a good chunk of his head off.  She doesn't even use some sort of garlic/holy/ultraviolet blade, it was just Viktor's personal sword...  If it were that simple, why wait until the 21st century to invent ultraviolet bullets?  Just walk around with a bunch of swords a la Highlander, remember this war has been going on for over 1000 years!!!  Also, when Selene finds out that the werewolves were not responsible for the war (or at least it shows her having doubts), she still arrives with a large force and proceeds to eradicate them.  When it helps the plot, the werewolves seem to succumb fairly easily to her bullets, but when Lucian needed to survive, he proved much more difficult to kill.  Finally, the fact that vampires fear light was not explored at all.  The city they were in appeared to be in perpetual darkness.  Selene never had to wait before zipping off in her fancy automobiles, it was always conveniently night.  And the moronic Werewolves, who can waltz around in daylight, don't seem to see the advantage of attacking the vampires during the day....However, those are just minor points.  After all, it's a vampire movie, I did not go see it expecting Gone With the Wind.  It's very stylish, I thought it was great the way the vampires in the coven all acted like some sort of landed gentry.  They don't do much in the movie other than look half-dead and elegant, but it was a good contrast to the more earthly werewolves.  I also didn't expect Viktor to be a Nazi-like vampire elder, unwilling to countenance the mixing of the races, even to the extent of burning his own daughter at the stake (with sunlight, she's a vamp after all).  She does wake him to save the coven from Kraven's treachery, but is taken aback when Viktor does not side with her.All in all, a great action movie.  It rivals Blade and Equilibrium for enjoyment.  I think the naysayers on this board just like to diss a good film because people are talking about this one like it had cult status (it's cooler to be negative).  If you like vampire/werewolf movies, this one is terrific.  Sure DVD buy.  8/10",Underworld
201,moviefan2003va,Decent Movie,8,10 January 2004,"This was a decent and ambitious movie by a first time director of a full length feature movie.  Wiseman needs to work on making the tone of his movie consistent throughout the entire movie. Wiseman was very fortunate to have veteran actors in his cast who have the talent to connect their characters to the atmosphere of the movie themselves. Their talent keeps the movie from being completely bad. I enjoyed the dialogue between Viktor and Selene. Also, I thought the parts of Lucian and Michael were well cast.  I think a big mistake was the casting of the actor who played Kraven. I don't like to trash actors but I think the part required more depth.  As a whole, the movie was okay. It worked and was a good showcase for Beckinsale in an entirely different role were she proved to be believable. I also thought that Bill Nighy brought a lot of presence to this movie. Again, I think it was the actors, with one exception, who ultimately made the movie better than it should have been. I was intrigued to find out what was really going on throughout. I certainly don't think it belongs on a Worst List of 2003. I saw many more inferior films in 2003.  I also did not constantly think of The Matrix or Blade while I watched this movie. Though they belong to the same genre, they each have a different story to tell.",Underworld
202,Nigel St. Buggering,Where were the vampires?,4,1 October 2003,"Vampires have come to a sad state of affairs lately. If ""Underworld"" is any indication, the only things separating vampires from humans is an ability to jump from great heights and land on their feet, and an inability to wear anything but black fetish gear.Not that a lack of vampiric prowess is the film's only weakness. Far from it. If I must pinpoint a single problem that haunts this film to the exclusion of all others, it's a complete lack of original thought. Clearly, the film-makers are going for an anime vibe, and at that they succeed, right up to the final sword move. But why is every single money shot here so thoroughly reminiscent of other, much better, movies? There's the bad guy on the roof of the car stabbing blades through the roof from the ""Terminator"" films. There's the creatures crawling along the walls and ceilings from ""Aliens"". And far too many moments lifted from ""The Matrix"" to even bother counting. There's almost nothing here that won't remind you of something else.The stylistic choices which are meant to be the film's greatest strength turn out to be a surprising weakness as well. Since the sun apparently never sets, we're given no information on how these so-called vampires operate. We're given only one brief look at normal humans, and absolutely no glimpse of how vampires and werewolves deal with them, or the normal world.Which brings us back to the beings at the film's center. Namely, that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, special about them. They have no strengths, no weaknesses, and no defining characteristics. I'm not asking for slavish dedication to the legends, but if you're going to re-imagine them, then do so; show some imagination. Give us rules, give us attributes and flaws. These vampires do nothing that Chow Yun Fat hasn't done in your average John Woo gun-play film. There's barely even any reference to feeding on blood. What makes these people vampires? They rely on guns, cars, and cell phones as much as any human being. As far as I can tell, if it weren't for modern technology, the werewolves would clean their clocks. The film might just as easily have been about green berets who fight werewolves; there's no distinction.Add to all this the fact that the most interesting characters are pushed into the background while the incredibly bland leads take on the spotlight for no readily apparent reason, and you have a mash that lands just this side of incompetent.",Underworld
203,amethystwings32,awesome,9,15 May 2012,"I loved it the action vampires and werewolf , all needed for a Gothic action movie! I found it to be entertaining all the way through,I watched it in the movie theater . And it was definitely worth seeing on a big screen ! The reason I loved it was the battle between the two, and their need to survive to weed out the weaker breed. It shows that if you can't see eye to eye and learn to coexist . There can be consequences , of catastrophic results. And that you can either fight your demons head on , or let them destroy you. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy good vampire and werewolf warfare. And grab the concept of the comic books . Although due to the blood and graphic scenes this movie would not be someone with a weak stomach. I give it an A!",Underworld
204,marimbadaddy,Excellent piece with plenty of grit,8,14 July 2008,"Underworld is a highly stylized vampire and werewolf action movie. It sometimes appears on the horror shelf, but it really belongs in the action category. The vampires and werewolves do most of their killing with guns and not their razor sharp teeth. Thought there is a bit of gore, and transformation scenes, it is not scary. Of all of the deaths in the film, only one human is transformed into a creature, the rest are due to the war between the vampires and lycans (werewolves) as they are called in the film.The movie features excellent action sequences, and a very interesting plot. The writers also did an excellent job of creating characters with depth, history, and an agenda. This film even has a sci-fi subtext which describes the nature of the vampires and werewolves.One finds oneself drawn into the film quickly while following the lead character's quest to find answers. But as she finds more and more answers, they only lead to more questions.This is an excellent action movie, with the fun of the vampires and werewolves fighting it out.",Underworld
205,FilmCreature,FilmCreature Reviews 'Underworld',8,15 January 2008,"'Underworld' is a film totally misunderstood by critics nationwide. This is not the kind of movie you take seriously. You will not weep or be shaken with emotion. Instead, with the right mindset (and surrounded by friends each with a bowl of popcorn) you might just have a fun time watching it.Kate Beckinsale does some great work here. This is no Academy Award-winning (or even Saturn Award-winning) character play, but Selene is such a sleek, lethal vamp that we can't help but just love her to death. Bill Nighy does great things with his vamp as well; Viktor is one of those great villains that Satan would flee from (yes, I just quoted Ebert). Scott Speedman is effective but not amazing. As for Shane Brolly...just try to ignore him. And finally, the lovely Sophia Myles. I actually liked her character quite a lot; her conniving, quietly lustful vampire Erika is great, but I would have liked to have seen more of her scheming ways.'Underworld' is obvious campy, but it's not boring, which is the number one thing it has going for it. Boring camp is tragic and awful at the same time, but 'Underworld', fortunately, has some nice performances and great effects, and the Gothic environments conjure up memories of 'Dark City' and 'The Matrix' in which no place is safe. Not even for a super-powered vampire princess.3/4",Underworld
206,nxgn_not_not,Leather,3,22 September 2003,"It's funny how one or two bad performances can drag the whole thing down. Kraven (Shane Brolly) didn't even fit in with the rest of the strong performances - strong given it is a special effects soup that defies the rules of both vampire and Werewolf ""accepted lore"" for no real effect.  Even if you buy the bio-engineering medical technology portion, there is no possibility in any tradition that I am familiar with that the dead can get pregnant.  Maybe I'm a purist, but that bothered me.  And the instant healing is getting a little crazy - The whole highlander x-men thing is getting out of hand.  I think the point has always been that Vampires and Werewolves can eventually recover from anything if they don't lose the will to live.  But instant healing is a little too far out there even for me. Beckinsale is easy on the eyes, but I had hoped for a little more range of emotion.  Sheen and Speedman do remarkably well with what they had to work with and Nighy is wonderfully over the top as the king of the hill should be.  My last gripe is that not enough was made of the vampiric speed.  If they are not going to be shape shifters (as some are and some aren't depending on the movie) then the speed has got to be there.  They started to touch on it with the ""super being cross breed"" in the final show down with Viktor but then they just glossed it over.  Plot point deductions drag this down for a high eight in my way of thinking to a low five.  That being said I might watch it again and see if I feel the same.",Underworld

Awwww, what a great love story. Than there's the werewolves and they want to kill the vampires. This movie is pretty good, it's a great versus flick. I thought Kate did an amazing job in this movie, I've been a fan of hers for years. Also, the guy who plays Lucien, he's good too. For the fans who don't like a lot of gore like myself you'll be happy to know that unlike other vampire movies in the past, this one has gore, but very little of it. Also, the action scenes were great, awesome special effects and terrific acting make this movie a pretty good movie to see.

208,jlacerra,All In One Night!?!,3,26 January 2004,"The idea that vampires and werewolves have been at war for almost 1000 years is the premise here.  Nobody wastes any acting skill on it.  The lead is Kate Beckinsomebody.  There are so many flaws I am glad that it was loaned to me (I didn't shell out a dime!)Flaws & SpoilersTakes place in  a huge city in which there is apparently never any traffic whatsoever.Seems to be in England, but there are enough American accents around to make one wonder.The main character seems to have stolen her wardrobe from Mrs. Peel of the Avengers, but, like most characters in this mess, she feels obliged to wear long flowing black dusters, ala Matrix.Vampire's reflections show in mirrors.Enough gun battles to make John Woo proud.Viktor, the el tougho boss vampire, appears to be a pantywaist; More Arthur Treacher than treacherous.The entire movie, with enough baloney to take two weeks, seems to take place in one endless rainy night.All in all, a waste of time, but not a waste of talent (there wasn't any to waste!).",Underworld
209,silentcheesedude,"Underdeveloped, but not bad",7,29 September 2003,"As I left the theater, I overheard bad comments coming from behind me- ""I couldn't get into that story"" ""Man, this movie kinda sucked"" ""I don't know what that was all about"" It's true that the same flock of people that came in expecting ""Blade"" like flick, or perhaps ""The Matrix"" of vampires and werewolves, would probably be disappointed. The movie doesn't stay on one concept, it's lower budget (23 million) gives it less CGI and smaller, reused locations, and the touted romance between main characters Michael (Scott Speedman, kinda boring) and Selene (played well by Kate Beckinsale) never really has time to develop. But if you take a closer look at the story, you'll find some interesting aspects.Vampires and werewolves have fought for many centuries, with the vamps having the upper hand. They live in large mansions above ground, while the werewolves live in underground sewer-like conditions. The war between them is about to become worse, and in the thick of it is Selene who suspects a conspiracy, one that may eventually lead to an attack by the werewolves. Lucian (Michael Sheen), is the leader of the werewolves. His rage is one that will lead to secrets that unfold later in the movie. As they hunt down a human who carries what is needed to create super 'werevamps', Selene has to deal with the clan at home. No one seems to believe her that something very nasty is about to happen. Which is too bad, since, in this movie, everyone here seems to go with their gut feelings and fantastic insights on what other people are thinking and doing.Acting wise, everything is as expected, but Shane Brolly, who plays Kraven, the leader of the vampires, does a rather poor job. He did not convince me, as an actor, that he was a leader, and when he gets upset, he looks like a little kid who had his blood candy stolen. Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are quite good, however.Action sequences were a bit mixed. There was hi-tech gun play, and there was plenty of it, but the actual confrontation sequences left a lot to be desired. Usually what you saw when it came to the hand-to-hand shots were closeups of the werewolves teeth... cut to the next smoke filled fight scene, wash, rinse, repeat.Rules of how vampires get killed were changed a bit. In here, they can die rather easily in comparison to other vamp movies like this one. But water doesn't hurt them, that's for sure, since half the movie is drenched in rain. Perhaps to balance the werewolves weaknesses? Roleplaying games, books and movies have gone through various different ways of rules that can be applied to how vamps and wolves function, so this is a moot point.SFX department- with Editor Martin Hunter and several dozen visual effects techs didn't do a bad job. With hardly any CGI in site they manage to do a bang up job with the werewolves' changes. The locations where the movie was shot, Prague and Budapest, give the movie a very authentic feel.Overall, the movie had more potential then what you see, perhaps a little more on the romance side? Better characters? But hey, I still liked it.Just don't expect oscar winning performances, mind-blowing CGI sfx, or originality. Just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is.7 out of 10",Underworld
210,asphyxion_,"For fans of Gun Fu actioneering & Gothic setpiecing, but a massive disappointment for vampyrism/lycanthropy lore purists",6,11 June 2020,"If you like your cinematography dark and Gothic like an Alex Proyas(sp?) film ala The Crow/Dark City, Underworld will most likely enthrall and hypnotize you with its gorgeous direction of photography, crafted set pieces and location shots. However, lore and mythology purists/for hards will be sorely disappointed as Underworld's creative screenplay leaves a hell of a lot to be desired when it comes to the established historicity revolving around vampyrism and lycanthropic legends: Neither species behaves or functions within their common frameworks in the Underworld cinematic universe, but instead follow their own physical laws/principles that are largely alien to established norms. Daylight doesn't exist here, regenerative powers are nonexistent or skewed or swapped entirely, lycans were actually slaves and day wardens of slumbering vampires (in spite of a total seeming lack of sunlight in the world), and everyone moves like spider-man caught in wire fu rendering of crouching tiger hidden dragon.Fans of slow motion Gun play and black leather gothism will have no problems enjoying Underworld. It's an easy to follow story with enough originality to separate it from other genre Mainstays and the actors do a great job bringing their respective species to life on screen. But this is no Blade trilogy, or the likes of The Howling or Silver Bullet or American Werewolf--mythos purists will probably cry outright at the complete disconnect from the troves of established vampyric/lycanthropic lore in the literary and cinematic spheres (although the future Underworld sequels remedy some of these more glaring faults), and watching alongside one of your nerdy purists friends will most likely result in a ruined viewing experience when they bake nonstop at all the inconsistencies they'll recognize after failing to suspend their disbelief when you warm then at the film's start that this ain't their typical vampyr/lycan flick.I think underworld deserves to be seen alongside the Blade trilogy so if you're fans of everyone's favorite marvel daywalking katana weilding demigod, you'll definitely acclimate to Serene and her Gothic romps though the lands of perpetual nightfall.Excellent midnight blood romp for any Gothic action fan of Blade/The Crow/Dark City. Just don't expect the film to do your deep understanding of mythos and lore any kind of respectably satisfactory justice.",Underworld
211,Knuckle,Not real imaginative or good,2,31 March 2006,"Essentially this is a Romeo and Juliette story with vampires and werewolves (imaginatively rechristened ""death dealers"" and ""lycans"")and they use guns instead of swords. The vampires are still dressed like leather bar hookers and the werewolves, excuse me, ""lycans"", look like homeless derelicts on steroids - ""urban feral"" if you will.For some reason, vampire clans always seem to lounge about in palatial, Gothic mansions and sip wine or blood or what the hell ever, and just generally do their best to impersonate French nobility with their idle chic. These vampires are no different, despite the fact that there is a rabid army of computer generated dog-men out there wanting to tear them to ribbons. One vampire, played by Kate Beckinsale, (I'm tempted to call her ""The Littlest Death Dealer"") sees that an eternal life of posing awkwardly on baroque furniture is going to get them all killed for good and does her best to warn the predictably disinterested elder of her clan that something bad is about to happen.One, two, skip a few, there's some twists and turns, people get betrayed, love is found, blah, blah, blah.All in all, the whole thing is uninspired. The art direction is stereotypical. You've seen the Gothic mansions, the gooey sewers, so forth and so on before and better in other movies. The acting is not horrible, but how good does it have to be when all the actors do is howl or bare their fake looking fangs? The action scenes - typical MTV, quick edit, see nothing sequences. The wire work is laughably bad and should really be accompanied by a badly synched dub-track. The direction is a pitiful mess. While Len Wiseman may have been trying to capture the dark, Gothic feel of the Underworld, I think he probably should have listened to his cinematographer when the gentleman said, ""We're gonna need more lights."" Of course, maybe Len was hoping that if we didn't see anything, we wouldn't realize just how bad it is.I give it 2 out of 10, because the ten year old inside of me keeps chanting, ""But vampire fighting werewolves is COOL!"" Maybe, but this movie isn't.",Underworld

After reading some of the comments here on IMDB, I had to think twice about seeing this in the theater as opposed to waiting for it to come out on DVD.... LUCKILY, I went to the theater!!!  This movie was great - the scenes are incredible, the story is new and exciting for the vampire genre, and the characters are totally cool. I was well impressed with the script, storyline, acting, and cinematography.  There were a few flaws or things I wasn't really keen on - a few of the usual vampire attributes were overlooked (but that's not a big deal) and it was a little more gorry/bloody than I like to watch.....  But other than that, this was really a fun, excitement-filled film - kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie....

What starts from there, is a thoroughly enjoyable dark, mythical, action-adventure film, till the very end.There is a sufficiently engaging plot. The writers have kept it simple. The vampires, in their story, do not possess any powers that gives then any edge over their rivals. That makes the fight and the struggle almost human. The action sequences are choreographed well. They look stylish and thrilling.We are given doses of history and flashbacks, intelligently cut not to drag on and ensuring that the story stays in present.Underworld is not an edge-of-the-seat film but definitely a very neat thriller.

214,lekgolah,"Blood, bullets & Beckinsale",7,1 September 2010,"This is another one of those types of films that should not be taken too seriously. If you watch the film from a critical standpoint then you will miss how enjoyable the film can be. Those who have no interest in vampires etc will not like this film but for those who do, this film is well worth watching. While the script may not be perfect, the actors manage to keep a straight face and are entertaining to watch. What many will like is the back story of Kate Beckinsale's character and the history between the vampires and the lycans. This may not add a lot of depth to the characters but it succeeds in progressing the story.Both Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are great as the leaders of two opposing forces. The two steel the film whenever they are on screen.Since the film is about vampires vs lycans, you can expect a lot of bloody action. The actions scenes can be compared to The Matrix and Equilibrium but they are still fun to watch. Even though some scenes do look dated (the lycans often look like puppets at times) they are still enjoyable to watch.The sequel may have improved CGI effects but that is not enough for it to triumph over the original.",Underworld
215,CyMaddux,"Compelling, Gripping",9,22 September 2003,"Its been awhile since the latest installment of a vampire/werewolf movie has been attempted at the box office.  This one is surely one of the finest I have seen.  The movie centers around the ongoing war between vampire and lycans (werewolves) and persistent power struggle to terminate the members of the opposite bloodline.  Much unlike the user who reviewed this on the front page, I feel the storyline is very solid.  The main character is played by Kate Beckinsale, who does a very stoic and realistic portrayal of a vampire named Celine who fights to avenge the brutual slaying of her family by the lycans when she was young.    This movie is filled with action and there are VERY FEW moments when something isn't going on.  The mood set by the movie makes the war and its participants very believeable characters if you are able to let your mind free and try to imagine what it would feel like dealing with feelings that have lasted for thousands of years.  This movie is not about bloodsucking and killing of humans (although some humans do die, although more of a result of being caught up in the war) and lycans are more than just being that howl at the moon during a full moon. The storyline is very solid and even contains a few twists which go along with the plot very well.    One of the only flaws of this movie is that most characters are not developed to their potential, then again this movie is not about getting to know a character;s personality and background, etc..   There are a few characters that you dont really know what their role is, but overall this is an excellent movie.     For the type of movie this is, Underworld met and exceeded expectations. The writing is very solid and the special effects are very good.  Beckinsale adds a no-nonsense female role that plays the part well and really gives Carrie Ann Moss a run for her money in leather.  If you can stomach the blood and have an open mind, you should be able to appreciate this movie for what it is-- A top-notch look into the UNDERWORLD!! 9/10",Underworld
216,DesertDogMedia,Underworld,8,30 July 2014,"Title: UnderworldCondensed Storyline: A war between vampires and lycans has been raging for thousands of years. A deathdealing vampire is trying to find out what the lycans want with a human. Notable Acting: This is one of those films where I feel like they hit the nail on the head with every casting call, having Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman as your lead roles gets your attention and keeps it throughout the movie. The secondary characters such as Michael Sheen and Shane Brolly are great actors as well. Everyone played their part greatly Noticeable Camera work: Classic and simple action movie range of shots, focusing more on the framing of the shot than the angle or camera work of it. Graphics: Be it the CGI that is used to show what happens to a vampire once they are shot with a UV round or what happens internally once a lycan changes, the CGI is of a really high quality in this movie. The CGI for the lycans when they have changed is one of the best that I have seen in a long while, there will not be another good movie involving good CGI werewolves until some time past 2014, as the other good movie with CGI werewolves was a year before this movie. Incorrect Science: Silver nitrate doesn't look like a silver liquid, it is generally a clear liquid. The bullets in this movie wouldn't have anywhere to store the gunpowder as the clear casings for the UV and liquid silver nitrate show only the liquid and not enough of the shell for gun power to be stored. If the weapons were using compressed air, that would make this acceptable, but seeing as they are not. They say Viktor is the oldest and strongest of the vampires, but it is then later established that he was turned by Marcus who was the first vampire and is still living, this contradicts itself. Overall Feel: This is franchise has answered the question fantasy and mythology nerds have been asking for years. ""Who would win in a fight? A vampire or a werewolf?"" This movie and franchise has basically been answering that question since 2003. In 1998 we had blade and other similar movies which had a man fighting vampires, but this movie went a step further. The movie strikes the dark Gothic tone that a movie like this needs and the level of gore is at a good level with there not being too much gore that you become desensitized by it and not too little that you are left disappointed.",Underworld
217,tritisan,yawn,6,8 August 2005,"I really wanted to like this flick, but I found myself constantly coming up with ways to make it so much better. To boot...1) Get a better leading man. While Kate and Michael and Bill and Scott provided decent performances, the complete lack of talent on the part of Shane really brought the rest of the cast down.2) Get a better film editor. The action sequences were remarkably uninvolving and dull. The exposition bits felt clumsy (in ways not necessarily due to acting or script).3) Get a better stunt choreographer, like Woo-ping. See above statements. Plus, in the final battle sequence between Viktor and Michael, it was SO obvious that their fists were no where near contacting each others' bodies. The gunfight bits were also pretty uninteresting. This might also be the director's fault, so they should get a better director, while they're at it.4) Get a better script writer. I don't have super-high expectations for this sort of film, but it still could've been far more interesting and involving. For instance, I think if they would have paid more attention to the way these Underworld creatures secretly inhabit our world, by say, starting the movie from Michael's point of view instead of Selene's. Other than Michael, his intern friend and some cannon fodder in the subway, humans played almost no role.5) Give the vampires and werewolves more interesting powers. Especially the vampires. They were too wimpy. The only interesting thing the vamps could do was jump from high places, or stick to the ceiling (which only happened once). They were atrociously bad shots and couldn't even hear well (like when Selene is surprised by a speeding subway car. Even I could frickin hear a subway car coming at me!) Perhaps I'm expecting more of an Anne Rice style vampire.6) More gore. I'm not a gore hound, per se. It's just that for this subject matter, it all seemed way too PG-13.7) Better soundtrack. The sound design was decent, but the early '90s-style industrial metal (which I used to be a big fan of) simply didn't work. They need something creepier, more suggestive, like Einsturzende Neubauten or Aphex Twin.Unfortunately, looking at Underworld: Evolution credits here on the wonderful IMDb, it would seem it's too late to take any of my advice, as most of the cast and crew is exactly the same.",Underworld

220,Sisiutil,"Promising, but ultimately disappointing.",5,8 February 2004,"Underworld's one of those films that had a lot going for it only to collapse under its own weight.Underworld's greatest asset is the stunning visual work. The film's world is gloriously dark and gothic, with almost no sunlight depicted--appropriate, given that most of the characters are vampires. The fight scenes are beautifully shot as well, and Kate Beckinsale and her stunt doubles are entrancingly graceful as bullets zip around her/them. (And, yes, she looks great in pleather or whatever that skin-tight outfit was made of.)The premise is promising--a war between vampires and werewolves, the former's erstwhile slaves and now deadliest enemies. And the filmmakers do a good job of gradually revealing the war's history and, as a result, shifting your sympathies from the vampires to the werewolves as the backstory unfolds.BUT. Like so many recent Hollywood action movies, this film sacrifices character to action. Fight sequences should always be relevant to the story and the characters, but as usual, they're just eye candy here way too often--F/X porn.As a result, much-needed character development is sacrificed and a talented actress like Beckinsale is largely wasted. The worst example of this: her love for Michael, a new werewolf. Apart from the fact that these people are both good-looking, why are they attracted to one another? We never find out.
Frankly, the conflict between Viktor and Lucien--the leaders of the vampires and werewolves respectively--had more teeth (heh, get it?). It should have been the A plot, with Selene and Michael's snoogins relegated to a subplot.
A couple of other complaints: first, the tone was unrelentingly grim. This is an action flick, not Ingmar Bergman. How about a few one-liners to lighten things up, gang? Second, more than once, vampires cast reflections in mirrors. Okay, if you're going to muck around with a well-known element of pop culture mythos, EXPLAIN IT SOMEHOW OR DON'T BOTHER!!Disappointing for a movie that seemed to hold so much promise. 5/10.",Underworld

Lo and behold, this film features a sexy and leather-clad Kate Beckinsale as a fanged fighter who sparks a war between the werewolves (led by the snarling Michael Sheen) and the vampires (presided over by Bill Nighy, chewing the scenery as usual). For a movie that draws so heavily from the ""Blade"" series, Underworld is fairly low on action, and high on talk, which would be fine if the characters didn't talk in ""Matrix""-like sci-philoso-babble. When, after an exruciatingly long buildup, push finally does come to shove, the action is served up music video style-fast, flashy, and utterly confusing. Though director Len Wiseman's insistence on using practical effects is commendable, the makeup jobs look ridiculous, especially those of the werewolves, who look about as advanced as 80's Yoda. This film's main saving grace is the actors. Beckinsale delivers flat dialogue (""We take the bullets out until they talk....and then.....we put them back in."") with badass appeal that transcends her tender looks. Only Shane Brolly turns in a disappointing performance, unable to settle for an American, Russian, or Irish accent, and delivering all three with equal boredom.

But despite their heroic efforts, they simply cannot undo the damage that having a terrible actress as lead has done.Casting for this went terribly wrong in that someone in their infinite wisdom, confused ""pretty and dumb"" with ""pretty dumb"", when in fact neither would have worked.So we have a scarecrow in a rubber suit, a single facial expression and no discernible talent.

For that matter this one had the better actor lineup. I like the Lycan design in this film and the transformations are pleasing too.Kate Beckinsale in a tight leather outfit and boots is always a winner.Give it a watch its a good film. 6 /10 is a fair rating.

227,DeborahPainter855,Errr....,3,27 August 2013,"Some movies are a chore to sit through because they are one cliché after another. This was one of those.Someone please tell me.. it was supposed to be a spoof. Right? No? All I remember are chases ... werewolves chasing vampires. Vampires chasing werewolves. In fast sports cars. In heels. The pacing was as follows: Ten minutes of action followed by ten minutes of regrouping of the vampires in their ""lairs"" to plan and execute another series of attacks against the werewolves. I suppose that all the fast cars and smashups and blood are supposed to give me a sense of suspense and tension. All I derived was boredom. There did not need to be vampires or werewolves in this picture. It would work nicely as a gang war movie. The plot was, barring the fantasy elements, the conflict of one gang against another. That was what I took away from the film. Somehow I suspect that the characters were supernatural rather than human to bring in the horror fans.",Underworld
228,jimboduck,Horror Classic! - 10 (classic),10,14 February 2005,"Ah yes, the sons of the Corbinus clan, one bitten by bat, one by wolf, one to walk the lonely coil of mortality it's a ridiculous legend. Nothing more.UNDERWORLD was a huge surprise for me. I had supposed that it would follow the paw prints of American Werewolf in Paris and would disappear into the forests of cinema shame, but not in the slightest. This movie was my introduction to a new kind of horror movie, one suited for the post-apocalyptic vigilante in all of us. No doubt it was influenced by movies like Matrix and Vertigo and will likewise influence future horror productions in the vain of Van Helsing, Blade 2, ad infinitum.Concept, concept, concept is the name of the game when you dabble with blood, and dabble it does. UNDERWORLD is a modern day story about the genetic war between werewolves and vampires. It doesn't get cooler than this. To the story add mixed blood lines, lots of bullets, and the slightest dash of history, and I believe you me have an instant classic on your bloodstained hands.Let's imagine, if you had to shoot a werewolf-changing scene, how would you do it?Suffice it to say, all of the monster scenes in UNDERWORLD are masterfully and meticulously done so as not to offend anyone. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you can stop reading this piddly review and head to the video store this afternoon before dusk to see what I mean.My last comment about UNDERWORLD will be a big hail to the UK, whose actors appear in cunning disguise throughout the movie like an underground model UN. Sure, there is a German guy who dies and bleeds all over the place midway through the film, but we never know whether he's a werewolf, a vampire, or what. If we want to pursue that controversial issue we have no choice but to buy a ticket to the sequel, or prequel, and see what happens when the full moon emerges.JY",Underworld
229,formicidae,Lower your expectations... considerably,6,23 September 2003,"Underworld is visually impressive: the dark brooding mood of Burton's ""Batman"", the detailed sets, and the very fetching Beckinsale make the movie appetizing to watch. Unfortunately, beyond the eye candy buffet, there is very little else to consider good about the flick.   Some specific disappointments:    1. Beckinsale's character Serene is a ""death-dealer"" vampire whose task is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (werewolves). After watching a few shooting scenes, I sincerely felt Serene would have lasted only a couple of days on the job. She can't hit a thing, despite spraying hundreds of rounds at large targets only a few metres away. It's hard to buy into a hero who can hit marble busts in the shooting range, but misses three large bodies in a small hallway.   2. The love story is weak at best, or maybe I'm inattentive. With a minimum of dialogue between the two, the relationship between Serene and Michael (Speedman) seems based on looks and looks alone, but apparently a strong and almost unshakable love bond has developed by the end of the movie. I don't mind surprise endings, but the depth of emotion here seemed an afterthought.   3. Shane Brolly (who plays Kraven) is pretty brutal. I'm sure he's a nice guy, so I don't want to diss him personally, but every scene he's in is a major distraction from the film. His sneering, spitting delivery is utterly unchanged throughout the movie, to the point where you wonder if he is capable of any other emotion beyond rage or disgust.   4. Goofy stuff that just seemed weird: Serene's idiotic driving everywhere and nowhere at breakneck speed (solely for product placement?), the Lycan's apparent refusal to actually use the deadly ammunition they've developed for the vampires, the inherent lack of logic of the war (why didn't the Lycans just kill all the vampires during the day?), and the avoidance of acknowledging that daylight is gone, etc.   Maybe I'm being petty, but with a movie that's taking itself this seriously, and with the amount of effort that obviously went into making it look good, I expect some consistency and development to the overall story, too. With a little consideration, it could have been a much, much  better movie.   Perhaps the sequel will redeem this one. 5.5/10",Underworld
230,quatermax-1,Target audiences and horror fans will love it...,7,8 February 2008,"This movie has had some bad press, so, as you can imagine, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying it and actually wondering what was going to happen next.Underworld, as a little too lengthy a prologue tells us, is set in a world where humans unknowingly share the planet with two other warring species  the Vampires and the Lycans (Werewolves). The war has lasted for centuries and the Vampires are winning  or so they think. The Lycans have got a few little genetically modified tricks up their furry sleeves and some moles in the Vampire camp (now it's not often you can string that kind of a sentence), and when a romance starts to develop between a Vampire and a prospective Lycan, all the old wounds are opened - and eagerly chewed at. Sorry.The plot is reasonably, but not too, complicated and has a few nice twists. The imagery is suitably dark and Crow-like (Brandon, not Russell) and being mostly filmed in Budapest the architecture is decidedly Anton Furst/Gotham City Gothic.The action too is derivative of many other films: there's plenty of John Woo double-fisted gunfire; Lots of Matrix leaping around in long coats and tight leather; American Werewolf transformation scenes (sometimes a little jerky), and a fair share of Blade-style bloodletting.And this is why I think it got the negative reviews it did. It is shamelessly derivative. Fortunately though the story and some good performances make up for this, and it's hard to see how else they could have told such a story without these style graphics, and after all, if something is proved to work well, then use it, and I think audiences have now come to expect it.Also enjoyable to watch is the usually light comedy actor Bill Nighy (Love Actually) who obviously felt it was time to (literally) get his teeth into something a bit meatier, as he revels in the role of the Vampire Lord Viktor.Target audiences and horror fans will love it, though there will be uproar when they see Vampires casting reflections in mirrors. But Kate does look good in that leather. Move over Trinity",Underworld
231,NolanSorrento,Nothing new (spoilers),4,20 January 2004,"We all knew that this movie would be using a lot of flavoring from both The Matrix & from Blade, but I didn't realize it was going to be using look-alikes from some rock bands and a real live version of Battle Angel Alita, so here's my review, and bare w/ me.Vampires & Lycans (werewolves) are at war w/ each other over a reason, shrouded in mystery. The division of Vampires that we get to see is lead by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, & the primary warrior of his crew is Gally from the movie Battle Angel Alita. The Lycans are headed up by Rob Zombie. Rob Zombie is hunting after Scott Stapp, the lead singer of Christian Rock band Creed. Supposedly he's got a special blood type that is all but a myth.Of course as luck has it, Gally falls for Scott Stapp and gets booted out of her club for conspiring w/ the enemy. This leads her into the typical superhero storyline of proving herself right and also getting to do the I-told-you-so thing when it all goes to crap for her home team.The rest is about as typical and you already can guess the ending. On a plus side I do want to speak highly of the visual f/x, excellent for the viewer who needs to study that rather then the story.",Underworld
232,pc_dean,A-Vamping We Will Go,7,7 November 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but a good while ago, vampires stopped being hideous corpse-rats and aloof Mitteleuropean aristocrats with funny accents.  In many cases, they even stopped being bad guys.  Your average vampire these days is slick, sexy, and angst-ridden, living an eternal Gothic bacchanal.  What, precisely, is so inherently sexy about a reanimated corpse has always escaped me.  I blame Anne Rice.  Or maybe that Keifer Sutherland movie.  Anyway, that particular strain of vampire fiction has always impressed me very little; nothing wearies my patience quite like some pretentious navel- gazing twit done up in black, pausing to murder a cute starlet before whining about the dreariness of existence.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody hand me a wooden stake.That said, I have to admit that `Underworld' is a pretty decent movie.  It treats its vampires vs. werewolves war scenario with a trifle too much seriousness, and borrows heavily from other movies in its visual vocabulary, but it throws enough talent at the problem on both sides of the camera that it pulls through. Besides, it can't help but be better than the leaden, preening `Interview With the Vampire'.Our bloodsucking heroine is Selene (Kate Beckinsale, very fetching in a patent- leather bodysuit), who is a `Deathdealer', one of the leather-trenchcoated button men of the vampire world.  The Vamps, we learn, have been duking it out for centuries with the Lycans (a fancy name for your garden-variety werewolf). Throughout, the human race has been oblivious to the fighting, which apparently means ignoring a couple of gory firefights a week.  The exact casus belli here is unclear for much of the movie, and even the characters don't really know since, as Selene tells us, researching history is forbidden.  Boy, that's never a good sign.  The war is as much a conflict of dueling fashion sense as anything else: the Vampires are sleek dilettantes who loll around on vintage furniture in grandiose mansions, sipping blood from crystal goblets and exchanging sardonic smirks, while the Lycans are hairy and unkempt rowdies who live in the sewer and amuse themselves by beating the snot out of each other.  The Vamps dress in fancy evening gowns and tailored leather; the Lycans' idea of high fashion is an old Bundeswehr jacket and no shirt. The Vampires have guns with lots of polished chrome compensators and electronic doodads stuck all over them (they do target practice on Renaissance busts); the Lycans are fond of AKs and oversized Desert Eagles.  Interestingly, the Lycans all appear to be male.  Can't imagine why. Anyway, while out snuffing a couple of Lycans, Selene notices that they seem to be following Michael (Scott Speedman), a medical intern at a local hospital, and also discovers that the sneaky wolves have developed special vampire-piercing bullets made with irradiated liquid sunshine.  She decides to check into Michael more closely, over the opposition of her vampire colleagues, and discovers not only the roots of the war, but also that everything she has believed all of her undead life is, er, inaccurate.The movie is set in a Stygian and rainy City With No Name, located somewhere in eastern Europe (`Underworld' was shot in Budapest and Prague). DirectorLen Wiseman films the place with a lot of gray filter and shadow, which gives all the characters the wan, ashen appearance of the walking dead.  The atmosphere is a definite plus for the movie, though it's hardly original. If vampires were real, this is where they'd live - they wouldn't stand out for not having a tan. Kate Beckinsale gives a subtle and effective performance as Selene, though I'm not sure if it is the one intended.  She seems to be written as a steely warrior, but Beckinsale comes off too delicate and waifish for that.  Frequently in her combat scenes, she looks disconcerted, uncomfortable, and a little scared.  She's competent but not confident, and seems like something of a shyly charismatic tomboy who's a vampire but isn't really into it.  When she walks through the grand hall of the vampire hangout, the in-crowd vampires just stare at her with what might be disdain, and she doesn't give them the time of day (well, night I guess).  Selene is, essentially, an orphan a couple of times over, and Beckinsale's performance gives a definite sense of the vulnerability this entails. Frankly, I thought all this made her a more interesting and appealing character, whose courage comes from control of fear, not absence of it, but I'm not sure it's what the creators had in mind.  And you do sort of keep expecting other characters to put their arms around her and say, `There, there, Sweetie, werewolves aren't really real, they're just make-believe.' Wiseman selected quite a good cast for the movie, even in small roles, and this helps immensely in making `Underworld' entertaining.  Speedman is fine in his secondary role, though he and Beckinsale's inevitable romantic bonding is a little unconvincing.  As the Lycan boss, Michael Sheen creates a compelling portrait of ferocity that becomes oddly sympathetic, particularly when his grievance against the vampires is given an airing.  The only weak spot in the cast is Shane Brolly, who plays the cowardly but devious vampire chieftain Kraven (the legendary vampire warrior-king he is playing Prince John for is called `Viktor'.  Such is `Underworld's idea of symbolism).  The fact that Kraven is something of a sissified drama king does not excuse Brolly's hyperventilating all his lines like he's climbing Everest or something.  Viktor, incidentally, is revived as a desiccated mummy in the course of the story, and Bill Nighy plays him with eerie, amoral dignity even through many layers of prosthetics.The ending leaves room for a sequel, as is increasingly common among action movies, all of whom have decided to at least leave the option of creating a franchise.  I mean, pretty much everything gets a sequel these days.  And you could do worse, I guess.  After all, how many books did Anne Rice write?",Underworld
233,MadWatch,Out of the way traditional mythology!!,5,22 September 2003,"Out of the way traditional mythology!! Here comes the all-new, all-different mythology!Remember when Vampires were solitary undead creatures that fed on the blood of the living? They were scared by symbols of religious power, hurt by garlic and sunlight, cast no reflections, could mentally dominate someone weaker than them, change their form into a bat and the only way to kill them was to put a stake through their hearts.Well, those are the ""old"" style, stuffy vampires (*rolleyes*). The ""new"" age vampires are sleek and sexy and like to hold partys in elaborate mansions. If holy artifacts or garlic bother them, there is no mention of this and there is no no-reflection problem. They like to wear tight, black clothing, roam around the urban sprawl at nighttime and use guns. A lot.Remember when Werewolves were solitary creatures with tortured souls that were *cursed* with lycanthropy? The full moon made them turn into murderous, half-wolf creature fated to kill until someone was able to put them out of their misery.Well, those were the ""old"" style, stuffy werewolves. The ""new"" age werewolves live in packs under the city and can change their form at will. It is not so much as a ""curse"" of lycanthropy, but a way to get super-hero powers of supernatural strength, agility and invulnerability. Also, they like to use guns. A lot.It's a sad fact that what the modern world continues to call ""vampires"" and ""werewolves"" and almost completely different creatures from their originals.Anyway, how was the movie otherwise? It was okay. As others have mentioned, it was an action style Vampire/Werewolf version of Romeo & Juliet. As I mentioned, since the original ideas of Vampires and Werewolves are long gone, you just have to assume that the creatures in this movie are doing what they are supposed to be. The feel of the movie is more like watching someone playing a video and you missed the first part. The person playing know what is going on and accept what is happening, but what is being presented to you is missing explanation.One of the jokes about action movies is that the main character can go single-handedly against a bunch of enemies, with bullets whizzing everywhere, and walk away unscathed, while the enemies are all dead. Well, this movie goes overboard on this. In one scene, the main character, Selena is confronted by 5 machine-gun weilding enemies. She is crouched down at the far end of a room and fires her pistols, straight-armed at the enemies that are using the doorway as cover. Meanwhile, 5 of them unload machine guns into the room she is in. The result? 5 dead enemies, while she walks away unscathed. Why are these Lycans so scary?Despite having Vampire and Werewolves (traditional ""horror"" creatures), this is in no way a horror movie. It is an action movie. I cant even say that this movie has nice combat scenes, because whenever Selena was confronted by an enemy, there was no suspense, no assumption that she may get hurt. It was like she invulnerable (or what gamers would call ""being in God mode""). *Yawn*I thought that the Vampires were a bunch of prissy, lad-de-da, gothic party goers and really, really wanted them to die. Even though the Lycans were ""supposed"" to be the bad guys, I felt pity for them because they seemed downtrodden and had little hope, where the Vampires lived the life of luxury (this is explained in the movie, though).I also, couldnt help but notice the underlying social undertones: The brutish, animalistic Werewolves were all male, yet the sleek, sexy, charismatic vampires were males OR females, withthe lead character being a female. Of course, it was the Lycans plan to bring them all together in a form of harmony and joining and it was the Lycans that were enslaved by the Vampires.Overall, I give the movie a 5 out of 10. The story was rather blase for the 1st two-thirds, but picked up once you found the ""true"" story. The action scenes were pointless, especially the ones involving the main character.",Underworld

UNDERWORLD is no fun at all.It's an unrelentingly bleak, gory, underlit, undernourished, and over-directed vampire/werewolf film with not so much as a shred of irony or wit. So, you might think, there's nothing wrong with that.Well, think again. There is no exposition to the story, which is fine because there is no story. There is no introduction to the characters, which is fine because there are no characters - just pretty puppets for the teenage crowd. The piece has no rhythm, which is fine because there is no plot. UNDERWORLD is a non-entity which draws blanks in *every* respect except gore and f/x. And it's ridiculously prudish, too. Gushes of blood all over the place, but the minute there is no much as the *hint* of nudity, a well-placed pile of books placed before the actress ""protects"" our innocent children from seeing nipples. I love the Americans - their bigotry in such affairs is unrivaled anywhere in the world. :)So, don't watch this unholy mess.

238,owen_twistfield,Almost campy were it not for the lack of campy dialog,6,22 December 2007,"(This is a reevaluation of this movie: my revious review was more positive and gave 7 out of 10.)Underworld was doomed never to be a 'good' movie. What was to be expected? A well written plot? Superb acting? Great dialog? It is simply not that kind of movie. After seeing it more than once I found that this movie get's dull quickly. It is simply a movie that has nothing to special to offer(besides kate that is) and re-uses things we have seen before(and better)in blade and the matrix. You should understand that the problem with this is not re-using things, because few movies actually invent new things. But this movie is beset by continuous re-using things that have been used before. It is like replaying a song over and over again until you get sick and tired of it. The style of this movies is at no point innovative. For sure a nice dark brooding mood pervades everywhere but is ruined most of the time by overusing items of just using strange items. When it is raining everyone unfolds the same black umbrella. Every vampire and werewolf is dressed in the same leather trenchoat. All use the same weapons(G38K) and use the same dumb tactics(running at the enemy firing their weapons). Especially bad is the music. Which yet again use no Le met tell you first that I found none of the cast really bad except for Bill Nighy. Kate Beckinsale is the corner piece of the movie. She is an attractive woman who does a reasonable job in portraying Selene, a battle-hardened killer vampire driven by her hatred for werewolves. She seems to thaw somewhat when she meets the human Michael(Speedman), but not much, for you can't expect to much from someone who spends the better part of a millennium hunting ferocious monsters to extinction. At no point Selene turns into a steamy lover mainly because that would out of character. I stress this as many critics comment on the bad chemistry between Selene and Michael. But I found Michale Sheen(lucian) and Shane Brolly(craven) much more interesting. In fact probably Brolly is playing the most interesting character of all.The battle scenes are acceptable. Those with kate are nice because they late her jump and run all over the place. They are well done and varied ranging of every method of 'interaction' one can think of and allowed by the tight budget. In fact is is surprising how much has been accomplished.While i found underwold a nice movie to watch once, it also saddens me that so much is missing. The movie really suffers from stale dialog and music. The plot has some interesting views on the vampiric and werewolf state but fails to miss the point that vampires and werewolves are predators using humans for subsistence. As far as the movies goes, Selene is only a sexy looking lady with some interesting teeth and eyes, a fling for tight-fitting dark leather clothing, fast cars and the nightlife. In fact the only time we actually see a vampire bite someone is when Selene needs to to safe speedman(you understand when you have seen the movie). The nail on the coffin is however the lack of any spicy dialog and good music. Don't expect any memorably conversation or one liners: there is none, nothing, nada, zipp. And music. It is another soulless mix of heavy metal and eletronics. This is really bad as we all know that you can have a crappy plot and have mediocre acting, but to become camp you absolutely need to have a campy dialog and campy music.I hope that the third underworld installment scheduled in 2009 will give us the proper dialog and music. Speedman should die horrible in the first scene, making Selene into an bad-dude wise cracking lady who exacts revenge on anyone crossing her path in a bloody horrible way. No further plot needed.

241,shalabodov-32997,Just ever so slightly above average,6,18 August 2020,"The story of this movie is the least interesting part of it, so here's a recap. There's a blood feud between vampires and lycans, Kate Beckinsale is a hot lycan hunter, the ""bad guys"" have concocted a sinister plot and there's a human involved.While visual style is present on screen, there's barely any originality in the action. Nearly every shootout feels as if it was ripped straight out of the Matrix. The vampires are wearing black leather coats and there's even a shot of Kate Beckinsale running and gunning in slo-mo like Neo in the luggage control scene. It was so unapologetically shameless, I couldn't believe it. However, with all its issues, the action is fairly entertaining and since the movie is rated R, there's some nice blood spatter so you won't fall asleep while watching it.My gripes don't end with the action, though. The acting is all over the place. It's safe to assume that Beckinsale wasn't hired for her performing skills as she is bland and emotionless throughout the runtime. You could try to justify this, since she is a ruthless and badass killer that's lived for so long, she's beyond emotions. Well, not really, because as soon as she sees the human (Scott Speedman), she immediately falls for him. I really doubt that an immortal vampire that's seen many generations of humans would suddenly break her covenant's code and run off with some dude. One of the characters even says - ""Hmm, he's attractive for a human"", just in case you can't figure out why the protagonist is into him so much. Speedman's acting is so atrocious though, it really threw me off. The central conflict of the movie requires the viewer to care about him and I was rooting for the bad guys the whole time.Bill Nighy plays of the vampire elders and he's the best part of the movie by a long shot. The man stole every scene and his death was awesome, albeit the script didn't sell how much of a villain he actually was. It's a predictable twist and with all the information given to the viewer about his past and his motivations, I felt like it wasn't enough to get me on the protagonist's side.
The accents were also inconsistent. Kate Beckinsale randomly switches between a british and an american accent, the guy who played Kraven had an extremely weird accent and his line delivery was poor at best.The biggest problem with the movie is, unfortunately, the romance. It's the main motivation of the protagonist and it's extremely forced. She doesn't spend enough time with the human, there's only one scene where they sit down and actually talk. That scene is nothing but exposition though and it breaks the ""show, don't tell"" rule. You learn about the backstories of the two leads but the actors deliver them so poorly, you just don't care.Overall, the movie has many problems but there are some cool visuals, some nice gore, and Kate Beckinsale in tight leather.",Underworld
242,prod74,Stylish and Entertaining,7,4 August 2004,"Being a fan of White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade I was looking forward to watching this movie. Although there were many elements from the game in the movie (I think White Wolf is going to court for this) it is not based on the game. And in my opinion that would make it a much better movie. Still, it was an entertaining movie that I enjoyed both times I watched it.The main characteristic of the film is STYLE. Everything was stylish, sometimes even at the expense of other aspects of the film, like the action or the story. The atmosphere was very good, a gothic, underground feeling was apparent through the whole film. The action was good and well choreographed. The music was ok, nothing special. And the story was interesting but I feel it was not used to it's full potential. A little more character development and more attention to the details would have made this a far better film.******SPOILERS****** There were two major mistakes I noticed. 1)When Selene tells Kraven that the Lycans were after a human, he says that Lucian would never be interested in a human. But Lucian is supposed to be dead (only Kraven knows he is not). Oops! I guess he gave that away. 2)When the captured werewolf tells Selene and Viktor about Lucian's plans he mentions that they need the blood of a descendant of Corvinus that is untainted (meaning that he must not be a vampire or werewolf) for the merging of the two species to work. Yet Michael is bitten early on by Lucian thus becoming a werewolf (and becoming tainted). I guess they forgot about it. *******END OF SPOILERS******To sum it up, this movie has some problems but it still manages to be entertaining. Let's hope they get it better on the sequel. Recommended for everyone at least once, as long as you don't have high expectations. I give it 7 out of 10.",Underworld
243,asticht,"Good FX, but lacks suspension of disbelief",6,20 April 2004,"Underworld is a movie that probably should be dubbed a Matrix wannabe.  The look and feel of the two movies are very similar, however where Underworld differs is that the Matrix has a very complex story underneath the action. Underworld is filmed in a gray tone which lends a creepy air to the environment, however, seeing vampires and werewolves battle it out with futuristic machine guns and other high tech weaponry makes the story seem a bit odd and distinctly unbelievable.  The plotline and story are very poorly defined until nearly the end of the film and only then does some redemption come for the whole film.  For the first ninety minutes of the film we are left watching basically one futuristic gun battle after another with little snippets of conversation pertaining to the ongoing thousand year war, There is hardly any attention spent giving the audience any indication of why these two species of legendary creatures are at war in the first place.  The revelations of the roots of the war at the climax of the film feel out of place and seem to not really explain why the war would rage for as long as it has.  You also are left switching sides as to who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys"" in the film which I think was intentionally done by the creators of the film to keep the audience off balance.  This only intensifies the confusion of the audience as to why this war is so important to these creatures and why it is taking place in the first place, and why for that matter are we as the audience witnessing it at all. The special effects and creature creations for the movie are really exciting to watch, however there is so much human type of violence in the movie that it seems extremely hard to believe that aside from pointy teeth the vampires have throughout the movie that these creatures are really vampires and werewolves.  Overall, there were alot of opportunities wasted in making this a really good horror flick, opportunities that could have elevated this movie from the modiocre, run of the mill shoot em ups it is right now. Hopefully the producers see some of the negative comments like this and make a better film for the sequel, as this one is only so so.",Underworld
244,sbrobin,Yawn,4,19 January 2004,"I saw the previews for this film and it looked awesome.  I couldn't wait to see it, but could never find anyone interested enough to go with me.  I finally rented it and was fairly disappointed.The storyline sounds incredible.   Werewolves (called ""Lycans"" in the film to make them sound cooler) vs Vampires?  How much cooler can you get? Unfortunately, the coolness factor doesn't expand beyond the concept.  Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires.  Unfortunately, the only way you'd know this is by the occasional glimpse of teeth and shot of a full moon.  They fight the entire movie with guns.  I felt like I was watching a bad splice of The Matrix and Blade.  What is the purpose of showing these two historical enemies fighting if they're going to be running behind each other with Uzis?  Almost no typical vamp/wolf lore was explored.  The ONLY thing the vampires do to show they're vampires if bare their fanged teeth and can jump from big heights.  They don't shy away from the sun, turn into bats, suck blood, or anything else which makes vampires cool.  The film even refers to them at one point as ""bats"" yet you never see it.  Scott Speedman provides a forgettable performance for all of his 15-20 lines in the movie.  The ending is VERY anticlimactic and is just a very watered down gun fight that would have been too boring to make it's way into The Matrix. I had to watch this film over 4 days because I kept falling asleep. What's more, the lycans looked absolutely ridiculous when they changed.  The werewolves from ""The Howling"" 20 years ago had better make up. 
If you want to watch vampires, get ""Blade"" or watch the television version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  If you want a good action movie with people running up walls to dodge bullets, get ""The Matrix.""  If you want both, you're out of luck because ""Underworld"" just doesn't cut it.  This is a film I was looking forward to seeing for months, and the end result was a yawnfest who's only success is a pretty cool looking poster.",Underworld

Its plot is simple and is a train track to platforms of cool fight scenes, snazzy special effects and Gothic photography.Kate Beckinsale is stunning as Selene, the vampire who finds herself caught between the fight to kill all werewolves but at the same time protect the one she loves.Yes, the dialogue is very frequently quite hokey. Yes, the fight scenes go on a bit long. Yes, the story is very minimal.But so what? If anyone goes into a film like Underworld expecting Oscar winning performances, an intricate story and hard hitting drama, then they need to find a bracing reality check.Underworld is escapism. For two hours, you get to submerge yourself in a world of style and ultra-cool. You don;t worry about doing the dishes, paying the bills or replacing the light bulbs.You sit back, shut off your brain and have fun.For pure enjoyment, I give it 7/10",Underworld
247,garynorton,Retropective review!,4,17 January 2006,"Noticing that the inevitable sequel to Underworld was about to be sprung upon us, I went looking for a review of it. Unfortunately, all I have to go on is the initial small tide of test audiences ( who are probably fans of the 1st). The critics have not been allowed a bite of the cherry before its Friday release date on 20th January.This is never a good sign in my experience! It usually signifies the distributing studio is hiding the film away to the last moment thereby reducing damage to the box office figures before word of mouth spreads.The first film had nothing remotely original to offer either, its story concocted to ensure every entertaining modern day piece of action was cannibalised for inclusion. Tight latex suits, twin handed gun-play, ""bullet-time"" style martial arts fights and fancy weapons (Matrix,Blade and John Woo movies to mention just a few). When I looked it up and found a rating over 6 on IMDb, I felt I had to tell it as it is! It has some okay moments and good production values, but the story is hogwash and the world they live in appears to be solely populated by vampires and werewolves! There are hardly any humans and no cops around either! In summary, its an all too familiar story of (seen it all before)style and little substance.I hope Underworld Evolution is better, but I will not be parting with my hard-earned cash before finding out more about it.",Underworld
248,bucekcrk,Cool Gothic,8,15 September 2021,"Underworld is one of the pioneers of Modern Vampire Movies, it's a bit strange for me Vampires and Lycans Use Weapons. The plot that is presented may indeed be a bit predictable, but it still delivers something impressive.I as a Romance movie connoisseur really like this film, the romance that is presented does not seem forced but is indeed given in a suitable portion, the romance is something that is able to build this story well, so it doesn't seem flat and interesting to follow until the end.For 2003 CGI, I really couldn't expect much, because indeed for 2003, the CGI that was shown was really very good, unfortunately the war scene that wanted to look majestic actually looked very cheap, the acting of some soldiers looked very rude, especially the shooting skills of the two soldiers who need to be questioned about their abilities.Overall, that's all this film lacks for me. Apart from the bad scene, I think this film is close to perfect for the year, moreover, this action with a unique romance spice is guaranteed to be able to make the audience feel at home watching it until the end.",Underworld

Okay, there are some clichés - buckets of rain, the dark blue lightning, but I hardly noticed; during the movie it didn't matter too much. This is action worth the money; not a complex plot, but an impressive performance with marvelous stunts and effects. One little disappointment: The final battle between Vampires and Lycans could have been a bit more of a macabre dance - I would have liked to have seen more blood. But with that said this is still action very much worth the watch. An exiting plot, not a dull moment, I was on the edge of my seat for almost two hours! The last time I saw Kate Beckinsale was in Pearl Harbour, she didn't impress me then, but Kate proved that she is a brave heroine in Underworld!

251,rosemcgowanrulez2001,"Seen It, Bought It, Loved It",9,28 January 2004,"I don't know why someone would say not to bother wasting your money on this movie. I am a horror movie fan, a fan of vampire movies and all that go along with that genre. I seen Underworld here at the Toronto Film Festival back in September 2003 and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so I could add it to my collection. This Vampire/Werewolf film is unique as it doesn't use the typical setting of Los Angeles for everything. Seems so many of these types of flicks always have to deal with Los Angeles. Fianlly this time the scenery is more along the lines of what this type of film should look like. Gothic. And instead of everyone walking around in regular everyday clothes like people of L.A. the characters are dressed in black PVC and leather. Hey maybe it is me but I think if this flick had been done with the setting of the TV series Angel, it would have been pathetic. I like Angel but too many movies with Vampires will seem to show them as regular people and that has been done too much. Kate Beckinsale is great as the lead, she speaks with her natural British accent instead of the fake American one we have been so used to her using in films. This whole movie has the right feel and setting, and it shows the vampires in a luxury life like they do live in when we read back about them. Werewolfs are underground, more of the ""lower class"" looking. The rules are followed so well for a flick about both fan favs and it works like a charm. Sure someone mentions about the American accents, big deal, I guess in the Czech Republic (where this was filmed) there are no Americans over there? Just like there are no Czechs in America? I believe that true fans of Vamps and Werewolves will be impressed with this flick. Also I think Vampires and Werewolves were not created or set in America like so many characters and movies ""Have"" to be. I mean come on, Fredy, Jason, Micheal Myers, Pinhead and Leatherface all are popular horror characters that seem to originate in America.Come on people put aside your usual criticizing,  this is not a boring Tom Hanks ""true story"" film, it is make believe, about two types of fan fav characters that are popular in todays times as well as say 50 years ago. No different than withcraft.",Underworld
252,derboiler,Boring Gunfights in a dark movie,5,27 December 2003,I personally like the dark style of that movie. What bored me was the loveless gunfights. And the missing suspense. It seems to me that this movie tries to mix Interview with a vampire with Blade. Well it doesn't succeed. Neither the characters and the plot are well developed nor the action scenes well choreographed ( apart of the end fight).  And this for about 2 hours... If you have really nothing else to do and if you love dark movies then this might be for you. 5 of 10.,Underworld
253,aegiswiz-accede,Vampire vs Lycan,7,25 October 2013,"In this outing it is Vampire vs Lycan. Lycanthrope being roughly ""werewolf"". I suspect between this movie and the colossal vampire story output by Anne Rice it was inevitable that any number of people would want to take this theme and idea in every direction imaginable. This particular outing isn't highbrow.This one is action packed. From the beginning we're shooting 30 -40 -50 rounds out of a single 8-9 bullet clip in a pistol. How some of the bullet victims can appear to squeeze their sphincter and have the bullets crawl out of the holes they've made in heads and bodies leaves me a bit curious, but it is kind of exciting. I had to get used to the idea that some die and some don't, and I never really figured out why because the movie was moving so quickly and was exciting, so I just forgot to care why. And I think that is what this movie is shooting for exciting. Unlike many ""shoot 'em up"" fun-arcade like movies this one actually has a story line. A PLOT! Actually there are a few subplots going on as well. Mind you, the story isn't written by Jane Austen.How about this there is enough ""plot"" left over to demand Volume II. Let's raise the Pom-Poms for sequels. Think Kate Beckinsale in tight black shiny leather and superhuman strength. But ladies, don't cringe away from this one so quickly. There is some kind of epic love thing going on here as well and plenty of ""love story novel cover"" type objects of affection.So, you know it is a vampire vs werewolf shoot 'em up story with love story subplot. What? You want me to write the story?I was entertained. I'm not going to knock some ""taking liberty"" with things like how many bullets and what can go through brick walls or leap from high buildings. Truth is, I recently learned J. Michael Strazynski wrote Underworld #4, so I'm starting again from the beginning as I've never known JMS to write a bad script. This one earned its #7 (8?) by pure excitement and entertainment.

254,kingderella,surprisingly good!,7,26 February 2008,"being a movie about leather-clad vampires fighting werewolves with guns, underworld will never be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and brilliant work of art, but thats not what it wants to be in the first place. it wants to entertain, and while doing so, it manages to be a surprisingly good movie too.no, underworld hardly breaks any new ground. and yes, it has its flaws. the limitations of the budget show throughout the movie, the action scenes are quite unspectacular for an action movie, and Shane Brolly is just terrible. but the rest of the cast does pretty well. especially Kate Beckinsale plays the lead character to perfection and she has great chemistry with romantic interest Scott Speedman and father figure Bill Nighy. the Gothic set and costume designs are beautiful. the most surprising thing, however, is how well constructed the story is. this kind of action/fantasy/sci-fi movies often have terrible plots, but underworld is built on a story that actually makes sense, comes with a decent twist, and even resonates emotionally. while its not as good as matrix, its much better than van hellsing, catwoman, aeon flux, ultraviolet, or about any other movie of this kind.",Underworld

You Get Underworld, an easy contender for worst film of the year. Lot's of things blow up, werewolves morph before our eyes, and it all happens in a dark washed out world straight out of a Fritz Lang wet dream. But the thing is boring, nothing of any real interest happens, and the chemistry between anyone in the film is virtually non existent.

Most of the time that two of the most immortal beings (vampires and werewolves) usually destroy humans.  No so in this action-filled movie that has Kate Beckinsale who plays a warrior vampire who must destroy the werewolves who supposely killed off her family.Miss Beckinsale must protect a supposely human (Scott Speedman) who is one of her enemies, a werewolf.  During this time frame she has feelings for him and which turn brings a manhunt to capture Mr. Speedman from Miss Beckinsale character's enemies.This movie from the very beginning has some good points.  One such good points that racism is everywhere even though they may look human they are truly not because of their differences of the two clans.  Another good point is that Mr. Len Wiseman brings everything on the table with so much action as well as drama as Miss Beckinsale character tries her best not to slay the person who is the enemy but also saved her life.This movie has already made its budget and a possible sequel is in the works.

I saw/read where shehas a dancer's background, and it shows.  But in a good way.  Ijust watched the movie again today when my toddler napped.  AndI'll see it again probably by the close of this week.  It's a fun movie. And I don't agree that it's a rip off of Matrix.  The Matrix ripped offother movies in the second and third versions of it's franchise!  [sothere]  If you want to see a good sci-fi movie, then see this movie.

It had a hot girl(Kate Beckinsale) who could not act at all, ridiculous non suspension of disbelief effects and unrealistic shenanigans using guns, and a cold as nitrogen plot.The plot(what there was of it) was parts Romeo and Juliet, parts soap opera, and part MTV video.They tried to be hop and cool and only were derivative of others' writing: Anne Rice, Lord Byron, Shakespeare, etc. I DID LIKE Kates' BODY in her vinyl suits and corset/bodice worn OUTSIDE her skin tight suit, BUT although she is eye candy(and is hot for the first few times you see her pose and strut and such, eventually you realize she is not that cute or well built enough to carry this movie.I have read EVERY historical Classic of Literature about werewolves and vampires, and many non fiction works about both, and this movie is about as exciting as reading the box labels of Count Chocula and Werewolf cereal!",Underworld

Never during the entire film were we encouraged to really care for any of the main characters. Whenever Selene or her beau would get into danger, my immediate response was ""Oooo... pretty, but who cares?""  The film is comprised of visuals and action, a plot that could have used some more attention, and characters as shallow as a piece of cardboard. Whoever played the villain, Kraven, acted like he was on a Mexican soap rather than in a movie. I never once believed this guy would be in charge of a the vampire valet parking lot let alone a whole coven. What a whiney bad guy! Ick.  Kate Beckinsale did a fine job acting, but then again, the script didn't have her act very much. She broods well, but the lack of substantial character development outside of flashbacks meant that I couldn't really feel for her character at all. If you mute the sound, you'd get just as much out of watching this flick. Hence, this movie would be excellent projected on the wall of a noisy Goth club or behind a Goth band during a show.  You could easily turn it into a drinking game. Chug every time someone kicks in a door!  See the movie and you'll understand the joke. Better yet, wait for it on cable.

I've watched this movie about 5 times now (I have the DVD; just the regular one, not the ""extended"" one), and I still don't get the feeling that their connection is really that strong. So he saves her from a car wreck; so what? Vampires, especially ""Death-Dealers"" like Selene, have been brought up to despise werewolves and disdain humans.The werewolves and their lives also bother me; why is this pack (apparently) 100% male? Why don't we see any females in their group? Are all werewolves made, not born? It's one of those nagging inconsistencies that really irritates me.The movie has great production values, good tunes and nifty special effects, especially the werewolf transformations.

Including a lot of actor body language, weapon usage, wardrobe, setting and even the general color scheme. It's basically The Matrix with vampires instead of machines... with one problem, it's not even a fraction as good.The story itself is well documented so repeating it won't help much, but what will help is to prepare you to a somewhat low budget production (or seemingly so) with poor acting (yes, even by wonderful Kate) and uncomfortable clichés. The story has potential (vampires vs. werewolves) but it's hard to shake off the feeling you're watching an episode of some low-budget vampire series. The dialogs are mostly predictable and shallow, and it seems the focus of this movie is on a disappointing 'cool factor' rather than absorbing the viewer into the story.I'd recommend this movie to hardcore (and young) vampire/werewolves fans, but they'll watch it anyway... if you're not automatically taken by that theme, stay away.

269,kenhe,"Too much action, not enough horror",7,10 December 2004,"I suppose it's my own fault that I had such great expectations from this movie, I had hoped for a standard horror thriller, with innocent human victims preyed upon and devoured by vampires and werewolves in the course of the conflict. And indeed, that is how Underworld started out, but quickly this movie transformed itself into a routine, and not particularly exciting action flick. In my opinion, in horror movies the supernatural antagonists have to inflict their savagery on relatively defenseless victims, victims who ultimately conquer and kill these predators by some clever and unexpected ruse. In this movie, first of all, both vampires and werewolves are equally unsympathetic to humans since both use their formidable powers to prey upon their unaware,unsuspecting and usually defenseless victims. Secondly, both of these groups of supernatural creatures were equally powerful, having achieved what could be called a balance of power in terms of their pretty standard weaponry. Thirdly, and finally, both sides got so tied up with their fantastic martial arts, their pistols, machine guns, and magic bullets, and even their car chases, that I soon forgot that they were supposed to be supernatural creatures of the night at all and they simply turned into Matrix wannabes. I felt that the sets were suitably eerie, the costumes beautiful, the acting better than average, and the plot of the film, when it was finally made clear at the denouement, quite acceptable. In fact, I feel that had the script been tweaked just a little, making one side somewhat more unfairly devious and even a little more powerful, that as a viewer I might have enjoyed an effective horror film, rather than a run of the mill action thriller, with vampires and werewolves in place of van Damme or Stallone. I can still recall, and relish, the rather ancient horror thriller of Frankenstein meets the Wolfman as managing to effectively coordinate fear, horror, and a pretty good fight scene without sacrificing the basic intent of the film.",Underworld

While the two are staples of the horror genre (""Dracula"" and ""The Wolf Man""), this doesn't play out like a traditional horror movie. This action packed story will please horror fans and convert new ones due to the melding of movie types to create a fresh interpretation to a century old genre.A male human (Scott Speedman) unwittingly becomes involved in an on going war between vampires and werewolves. When a female vampire (Kate Beckinsale) notices the werewolves following this human, she becomes suspicious and begins to investigate why he is so important, even if it changes everything she has ever known about her life and vampire history.This monster movie follows the age-old traditions established in the early novels (by Bram Stoker) and movies (""Werewolf Of London"") featuring vampires and lycanthropes. Of late, there's been some wanna-be trendy, horror movies that have thrown the standards out the window. Those standards are comforting and we, the audience, expect to see them. Vampires deteriorate in sunlight leading to instant death. Werewolves can only be killed by a silver bullet. ""Underworld"" takes these traditions, builds on them and makes them their own.While it reads as a horror, it plays more like a gangster movie. Both races participate in gunplay with specially modified bullets to instantly kill their opponents. The werewolves are brutish goons, wanna-be gangsters with more brawn than brains. On the flip side, the vampires are like a communal family with hierarchy, ancient customs and they're legitimate business owners which funds their criminal endeavours.Due to the aforementioned gunplay, this is more violent than gory. It's still bloody but there are no scenes that'll make you queasy or nauseous. The violence is another reason why it has a gangster feel about it.There's a class system subtext that runs through this movie. The lower class werewolves battling the upper class vampires. Working class is possibly a better adjective for the werewolves. They are masculine, unkempt and unsophisticated. On the other hand, the gothic vampires are immaculately dressed with a expensive sense of style. They lounge around looking glamourous as if they're supermodels at a cocktail party. Opulence and high class is the style the production and costume designer has given these blood suckers.Beckinsale's quite fetching in her erotic, PVC, full body costume. Her bondage like outfit's more interesting than her intentionally emotionless performance. One wonders why she didn't keep her British accent as the cast is made up of international actors with a pot-pourri of different brogues? It's good to see her in a lead role, above the title credit, where she holds her own portraying a strong, forceful character. Of late, she's played the glorified girlfriend part (eg. Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor""). Here, she's independent, without a partner to justify her significance. While this is the kind of role a man would normally play, she's still feminine and sexy without having to show any flesh.Bill Nighy has a supporting role as an elder vampire who's resurrected before his time in order to help Beckinsale. Nighy's rightfully become popular in the last few years. He's adept in any part he plays even a centuries-old vampire with superhuman strength. His climatic fight scene never draws unintentional laughs which shows what a convincing actor he is.The other name star of this movie is Bacardi. Product placement is rife during the opening sequence in an underground train station. This is quite surprising when you watch the entire movie.Never at any time is there any indication where and when this movie is set. The gothic architecture and vehicle licence plates have you thinking that this could be somewhere in Europe. There are no title cards, characters speak with differing accents and there are no recognizable landmarks used as locations. All we do know is is that where ever they are they have Bacardi. If the moviemakers were trying to create a nondescript world, alien from our own, then why use blatant product placement for Bacardi?The colour film stock has been manipulated intentionally to give a blue hue to it. This reinforces the gothic style of the movie. Blue isn't just a colour, it's also an emotion. It's constantly raining which adds to the cold look the cinematographer and production designer have created. These races are unemotional people which also strengthens the blue tone.Computer generated visual effects were used for the movie which is far removed from John Landis' ""An American Werewolf In London"". While the special effects are impressive, there is no mystery into how they were achieved. Special effects and make up were a real art form before the days of CGI. These technicians are a dying breed due to computers. It's a shame that moviemakers rely heavily on CGI as it's slowly becoming run of the mill.Overall, ""Underworld""'s a good action/horror/gangster movie with a strong female lead. This hybrid is filled with polished set pieces and seamless CGI. There's talk that this is the first of a proposed trilogy and I hope the next two will be as strong as this.",Underworld
271,fluffyclown,pretty decent flick,8,16 May 2004,"Considering the onslaught on vampire films we have had in the last couple of years, this one actually came out pretty good. Kate Beckinsale delivers two punches in this one.  She looks great in her slinky black leather get-up, and actually does a fairly convincing acting job.  Scott Speedman is as hunky as he can be, and even looked good after he turned greyish-blue.  The plot ran along as it should, with well timed twists and turns, and the story itself was fresh and interesting.  Different from your typical vampire fare, especially since more vampires got their throats bitten then anyone else.  It did get pretty violent in some spots, but it wasn't so gory that I felt like I was going to loose the popcorn I consumed while I was watching it.Overall, I liked it.  Rank: 8",Underworld

274,Ithorianjedimaster2,Talk talk talk talk talk . . .,3,17 May 2007,"""Underworld"" was made for the soul purpose of turning two icons of the horror genre, werewolves and vampires, and throw them into the action genre, along with some lousy special effects (which there are VERY few) and even worse script. Here's my take on the ""Swing-and-a-miss"" attempt to turn horror-movie creatures into action-movie stars.Underworld's main character is the very 'robotic' vampire woman, Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale. Selene has been hunting werewolves (or Lycans, which is the director's 'clever' name for them, taken from a deformity in the mind that makes the person think they turn into a wolf, but anyway) and she is also on a lot of stress from her commander, Kraven, and some blonde vampire that wants to be her. One night, during an assignment, Selene discovers the Lycans (*cringe*) are looking for the ""direct descendant"" of their elder, Alexander Corvinus. But (uh oh!) Selene, seeking help, awakens one of the vampire elders, Viktor, to aid her and her kin in the stopping of this plot (which for some reason, she seem to know exactly where the Lycans (*cringe*) are going and what they're planning). Viktor gets angry. Apparently, the other elder, Marcus, is supposed to be awake to rule and not him, but he quickly forgives Selene for waking him up many centuries early when he hears how the Lycan (*cringe*) leader, Lucian (who was thought to be dead), is still alive and well and is leading the Lycans (*cringe*) to their plan.In the meantime, we are introduced to Michael, the unfortunate human who happens to be the Lycans' target and while he is trying to escape from Selene, who isn't good at introductions, and the werewolves chasing him, he runs into Lucian, who bites him, and everyone knows that werewolf theory, if you're bitten by a werewolf, you become one, and that is exactly what starts to happen. Then, the action takes a long break until the ending conflict. In this time, it's all talk talk! DISCOVERY!!! Talk talk talk talk talk. Plot twist!!! Talk talk talk talk! Then, big showdown, and the movie ends as a cliffhanger to the much (MUCH) better, Underworld: Evolution.During all the boring 'explaining the obvious' scenes, you are just sitting there, waiting for the action to start up, but it doesn't. By then, you'll probably turn off the movie, since the characters just becomes so lousy, especially the emotionless Selene, that you don't even care if the vampires win or not.The movie is also plagued by bad planning. This is revealed in the Special Features. Apparently, the director and producer got this bonehead idea to make the werewolves look more and feel more like CATS. Do they even know what a werewolf is? What's worse, is that the director spent more money on the really cheap-looking werewolf suits then on the special effects. Maybe the director didn't get the idea that CGI gets more attention from the audience, so don't make so many horrible costumes and put some dough into the special effects so the werewolves feel realistic.The vampires aren't any better. Kraven, their leader, seems to have more of a temper than brains. The whole time, it appears that he lets Selene do all the planning, research, and grunt work, while he kicks back and drinks blood from a juice box. The vampires look and feel more like aristocrats than werewolf hunters. The movie tries to explain this off, by making Selene say that most of their ""deathdealers"" (hunters, basically) have died, and Kraven doesn't worry at all about the fact that a legion of werewolves are out there and he has only one Deathdealer, and numerous soldiers who are so dumb that most of their deaths are from sneak attacks from werewolves.A movie about a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves sounds like a very good movie that deserves to be at the top list of best planned movie, but the director can't pull it off and spent more time, probably, ordering Krispy Kremes for the studio than on the quality of script, the actors, and special effects. Ugh! I think my lunch almost came out from remembering this trash. Don't go buy it (HURK!), don't rent it (HURK!!), get the second one. (BLAAAGH!!!)",Underworld

276,SrCAPnCDLvl99,I can't believe I missed this theatrically!,9,5 January 2004,"I went into this film not having seen it in theatres and thus seeing it for the first time at home on an 80"" screen with a superb Dolby Digital track supporting it. I had a good time, a great time! This is a wonderful film that succeeds in every way that others, so called ""vampire/werewolf films"" as of late didn't, Blade II included. (sorry Del Toro) It has a great cast headed by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, striking visuals shot by the obviously very talented Tony Pierce-Roberts and the production- and set design is extraordinary. I mean, they've almost put as much detail and effort into this film as Jackson & co. did with The Lord of The Rings trilogy. And as you see it on screen, the past, the history of both species feels as real as ours.This Len Wiseman, who is he? Never heard of him, yet he has to be one of the most gifted filmmakers today to pull off the difficult task of pitting Vampires and Lycans together in the same film and make it such a great film that it turned out to be. He did a great job, as did the rest of the crew and the cast. I feel like typing up this huge review for this film, if only to pay it tribute, but I think I've said all that needs to be said already. If you want to have a good time, rent, or just buy it for god's sake. All you need to do is see it!",Underworld
277,enkephalin07,World of Darkness,10,29 March 2005,"It's not a direct rip-off, but close enough to support all copyright suits. Fans of White Wolf RPG's will recognize the setting, themes, conflicts and characters. Even the visual styles and recommended live action sound tracks in the book evoke a world that this movie framed and put into motion. This film could not have been produced without the influence of the body of substance that make up the World of Darkness' storytelling guides and source books.By the same token, fans of White Wolf also won't be disappointed with the film rendition of the World of Darkness; if it weren't produced by White Wolf, it still shouldn't have been produced any other way.With this film, the time of the action-horror genre has come, and the World of Darkness provides the most suitable foundation for it -- why not pay White Wolf what they're worth?",Underworld
278,chrisrobbins-2,A legend is born.,8,27 March 2006,"Underworldcontains spoilersUnderworld is by far the best movie ever made. Even better than Star Wars, so if you have not seen this amazing movie get off the computer right now, get popcorn, nice coca-cola and get this movie. First of all the characters were the best and fully developed especially Micheal Corvin ( who is played by the amazing Scott Speedman ). I am the biggest fan in the world of Underworld, i've got posters, computer wallpaper and icons, themes, books, and of coarse the 2-disk set unrated edition featuring 10 extra minutes never shown in theaters of Underworld. Selene is the most beautiful vampire in history who is played by the most beautiful woman in the history of history Kate Beckinsale. Also at the end how Viktor got his skull sliced in half is very intense and a amazing. And Singe the Lycan aka werewolf scientist gives us a lot of detail on how the Lycans and Vampires were started by Marcus( first vampire) and William( first Lycan). Only a fool, half-wit, and most idiot in the world would this amazing movie. I can't believe IMDb and it's people gave this movie a 6.5 it deserves at least a 10. Also if you have seen this awesome movie then please share how amazing and flawless this legend is. I have already seen Underworld Evolution and it is also a amazing movie. Thank you Screen Gems, Sony Pictures, Len Wiseman, Danny McBride, very beautiful Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, and of coarse the awesome Elder, Bill Nighy for this legend. This movie should get at least 12 Oscars. So if you have'not seen Underworld or Underworld Evolution then you STOP reading now and get of your butt and see this and the sequel now. 10 out of 10. You won't be disappointed at all.",Underworld
279,Vaseal,What Kate did. Oh dear look what Kate did next..,1,17 January 2005,"I had the misfortune to endured 15 minutes of Underworld last night. Not even the lovely (but talent less) Kate Beckinsale in Leather could hold my interest. I kind of liked the Vampire V Werewolf theme (When I was reading the synopsis in the telly guide), but the acting was terrible, the characters unbelievable and the plot absurd.To be fair, perhaps it improved as it went on, but I doubt it. A master class with Laurence Olivier wouldn't have improved the acting in this movie.I would be the first to admit that Kate Beckinsale is a babe, but her acting always leaves a lot to be desired. They say she is good in the aviator. As I haven't seen that film yet I can't comment but really all this lady is eye candy and shouldn't be a leading lady in any movie.Sorry Kate, but the truth hurts and she gets paid big money to deliver and seldom if ever does...I can accept Vampire firing silver bullets to kill Werewolves, but werewolves firing bullets mad of sunlight to kill Vampires? Give me a break..And this technology was developed by pre-historic werewolves living in dirty cellars under subway stations.So avoid this movie, you will be glad you did....",Underworld
280,cmivie,Excess bullets=Cool!!,6,19 January 2006,"Why is it that most action movies these days have to have a scene in which thousands upon thousands of bullets are flying all over the place, and yet maybe one person actually gets shot? I guess action films are trying to get a high rating for ""coolness"". In the opening scene of Underworld, we are treated to a shootout between the Lycans (Werewolves) and the Vampires who are at war with one another. This shootout takes place in a subway station, with many, many helpless humans around. And guess what? Only one human actually gets shot. The other 100 or so people actually dodge or dive out of the way. And it ain't like the Lycans or Vampires are using six shooters either. These are full-auto guns, and as a result a gazillion bullets fly. Now, the shootout does look good, but the logic with it is just heinous. But then again, this is an action movie, so we should just enjoy shootout. But, I actually thought to myself, ""Hey! No wonder one side can't get rid of the other. They can't shoot a damn gun!"". But, and I have to state this so here is a MINOR SPOILER ALERT......when Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who is a Deathdealer for the Vampires tracks down a Lycan in the sewer shortly after the subway shootout, she nails the guy with three or four shots. In the Subway, she couldn't hit a damn thing (except for the walls and columns). I just had to point that out.In any case, aside from Underworld being a bit illogical at times, this is actually a good film from an entertainment point of view. Beckinsale does a good job playing her role. I was concerned that she couldn't pull it off, but trust me. She is Selene, and she looks good at being a bad-ass. Scott Speedman is......well........I just don't know what to think of him. I see a lot of potential in him, and he does a good job playing Michael. Michael Sheen as Lucian is great. I wish he would have had more screen time, but at least we get to know why Lucian hates the Vampires.Shane Brolly? He is the guy playing Kraven, who is the worst character in this film simply because I am convinced that Shane Brolly is one of the most horrible actors I have ever seen. I mean, Jean-Claude Van Damme could teach this guy a thing or two about acting. Brolly looks so much like Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) that I thought he was gonna break down and start singing ""Closer"" at any moment. I realize a film like Underworld won't give you Oscar type performances, but this guy should never have been given the part of Kraven. Hell. Trent Reznor could have done a better job.Overall, Underworld is good for what it is. It entertained me, and has me looking forward to the sequel. It has its' holes and can also leave you confused at some points in the film, but the story does fill the holes (or it tries to). Get past the subway shootout and you should enjoy the rest of the movie.",Underworld
281,ddukart,Spoiler alert!!,9,23 April 2007,"I love horror movies and grew up on the old classics. And when there are more than one kind of monster in them, all the better! needless to say, this film was right up my alley. And Kate Beckinsale? Oh my God. Mean, tough, slinging guns around AND wearing skin tight black clothes? Doesn't get any better, I say. The special effects were very well done, the characters all superb actors and actresses. The story great, the atmosphere excellent! So, why didn't I give it a 10? Soiler Because of the ""super-godlike-ultra-megga-hybrid"" they build up and build up through the movie. Then, when he's supposed to come up and slaughter the enemy/win the day, he fights like a sissy, and pretty much gets his butt kicked. He ends up only winning pretty much by accident. That's pretty lame. I know the film makers want to build excitement, but when you keep making this thing out to be the next biggest thing to God himself, MAKE HIM THAT WAY. Much like in Blade (the sissy blood God), and Lord of the Rings (the troll guy who you think is going to lay everything to waste and his first fight with the beardy guy is over in two seconds. Okay a human kills the most evil, tough thing to roam hell?) Sigh...maybe its just me, but that's a plot hole that could have easily been filled by the hero-godlike-monster at least fighting his way through a few foes, totally kicking-butt so at least he's a little tired for an excuse for fighting like a sissy.But that's just me.It still was a killer movie and more than worth the watch.",Underworld
282,mitchelledwards,Nicely Done Gothic Action,10,4 July 2009,"I am a die hard horror fan so when I first saw the trailer for this I was ecstatic. Even though I love the finished product I am a little disappointed by the lack of horror in the film. The main character is a vampire and for most of the film I forgot that. Anyway other than that the film was excellent. Kate Bekinsale is solid as the beautiful yet deadly Selene and Scott Speedman is believable as Michael, there is a great supporting cast as well with the likes of Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, and Sophia Myles. The action is very stylized, there are gunfights galore, and for those that like atmosphere this film screams Goth. Overall I say that it is definitely worth watching also check out the sequel Evolutions.",Underworld
283,jiujitsu_jesus,"Not bad, not great either",6,20 April 2005,"UNDERWORLD is a hybrid horror movie, a cross-pollination of genres containing elements of action, fantasy drama, and good-old-fashioned chills and thrills. It tells the tale of a war amongst the supernatural underbelly of a city, in which a clan of Vampires is pitted against that of the Werewolves in a savage guerilla war sparked by an archaic feud between the two races. While this rather interesting concept sets the stage for what looked like a decent horror film, the ungainly, confused script, overdone visual effects and a few rather grating performances let the entire movie down into the depths of mediocrity.The basic thematic premise of the film - that is, that the viewer must ultimately choose which side, the Vampires or the Lycans, is in the right- is very interesting, but unfortunately, the poorly-planned and unbalanced plot doesn't give us much room to manoeuvre. For starters, the central character, Selene (an aesthetically appealing but often emotionless Kate Beckinsale), is a Vampire; as a result, we are given a fairly one-sided view of the action for at least the first half of the film. The plot would have been much more balanced if the key protagonist had therefore been Michael Corvin, Scott Speedman's character, a human with the potential to resolve the conflict. Through his perspective, this film would have unfolded much more coherently - however, with Selene dominating the film, the result is that the Vampires have much more screen time.Then again, this may not matter, for another flaw in the plot is that, in the end, we aren't given any scope for a moral choice between the two sides - and one is much more appealing than the other anyway. The Lycans are excellently presented, well-acted, and the scariest and most interesting characters in the film;while they don't exactly turn out to be in the right, so to speak, they come off with the moral high ground. The Vampires, on the other hand, are mostly boring and poorly acted, too similar to ordinary humans to be remotely frightening or interesting,and come through as a bunch of hedonistic toffs in Matrix-style leather; furthermore, their leader, Viktor (played by Bill Nighy) turns out to be a fascist old viper who instigated the war between the races in the first place. As for the war itself, while the action scenes are well-planned and blisteringly kinetic(particularly the fight in the subway), it simply doesn't try hard enough to frighten you. It may say ""Horror"" on the video case, but don't expect nightmares from UNDERWORLD.Presenting this interesting but half-baked plot is a mostly skillful cast, who have been held back, if at all, by their overdone and unconvincing dialogue. Only Michael Sheen and Scott Speedman shine, putting on masterful and appropriately Gothic performances, and respectively providing some of the rare, genuinely frightening moments in the film. Bill Nighy is too brilliant an actor to ever come off badly, but he doesn't seem to be exerting much effort in this characterisation; Shane Brolly is stomach-churningly woeful, with his ""acting"" consisting primarily of scowling and muttering through clenched teeth; and Robbie Gee, while his delivery is good, is failed by his ridiculously corny dialogue.The visuals in this film are its major saving grace. The cinematography is fluid, atmospheric and energetic; the sets are intensely Gothic and hauntingly beautiful; and, while the graphically-depicted blood and gore gets a little tiresome towards the end of the film, the special effects are otherwise dazzling, particularly the transformation sequences, which are the best I've seen in a long time. While the Vampires' leather and the martial-arts antics of the Lycans remind us, not fondly or amusingly, of THE MATRIX and THE TERMINATOR, they fit in surprisingly well with the strong Gothic ambiance.UNDERWORLD is a brilliant concept that was failed by its script; it is a beautiful piece of film-making that doesn't quite have the substance to fill its beautiful sets. Lakeshore have doomed this one to mediocrity- but it's worth a look if you stumble across it as you rummage in the bargain bin. 6/10.",Underworld
284,arvy,one for real vampire fans only,4,18 September 2006,"The opening scene looks like it is lifted straight out of the matrix with poorer light. Beckinsale plays a vampire who appears also to be wearing Carrie Ann_Moss's outfit from the Matrix as well.This is a film about vampires fighting for their place on earth and is connected to the mythology of the vampire line and their battle with the Lycans. All of this is explained in the movie, so I won't do so here.It isn't bad, but it really isn't great. There are a couple of good action scenes at each end of the film and the whole film seems to exist in the rain in some unknown eastern European town at an unspecified time.However this is thrown by the appearance of a 2003 maserati at one point! I couldn't help but thinking that Blade is just a better version of the genre, better action, better script, better effects.I'm sure a lot of the fans appreciate Beckinsale walking around in a nice catsuit, but to be honest she looks very small with large boots, and a posh English accent.If you really love your vampire films, this is a nice twist. If you just prefer decent films, watch ""Blade"" and have done with it.ps Michael Sheen steals the show in this!",Underworld
285,Darkfrog24,"It shouldn't be good, but it is.",9,7 November 2005,"Let's face it, this movie has a stupid premise. Vampires and werewolves fighting? Okay... What this movie teaches us, it seems, is that if the writing is good, the story is good, the plot twists are good and the characters are good, it's okay if the premise is a little stupid.Underworld surprised me, and that doesn't generally happen. The non-spiritual take on vampires and werewolves was a real treat, and Michael's flashbacks remind me of nothing so much as Niel Gaiman at his best, but I'd have to say that the most appealing part was the almost skeletal way they played the romance: The hero and heroine have only known each other for two days and... act like they've only known each other for two days? Brilliant! It made what was there so much more resonant and believable and highlighted the paranoia of certain other characters.The biology referenced in this film was close to accurate, although not perfect. For Hollywood, it was Mensa.There was one thing that I found particularly jarring, though: ""Lycan,"" sounds too much like ""lichen"" for the name to be particularly intimidating. That and the ending was a little bit too ""Hulk smash!""Word of advice: I've seen the regular cut and the extended cut, and I have to recommend the former. Many of the ""extra"" scenes were good, but they just didn't fit into the whole.",Underworld
286,wiredrabbit,WTF??? Matix with mad dogs,4,5 November 2003,"If it wasn't for the lead running about in PVC I'd have left early.  She does a good job really, but the rest of it is pretty sorry.  THe wolves do seem to be the stronger characterization although it truly comes across as a gamer script.  Speaking of, wearing latex with a corset on the outside is so wannabe goth I can't stand it (and what's with the idiotic gold studded redneck shirt?)  Someone's gotta teach these people how to wear black.
POSSIBLE SPOILER The secret to the film is that vampires are wimps.  Apparently anyone with a gun can fight wearwolves and the vampires don't have any advantage.  Once a vampire jumps and climbs on the ceiling; in the opening scene the lead jumps off a high building easily.  For the rest of the movie vampires seem to forget they aren't human.  Oh, look it's a werewolf, I'm scared!  In one scene vampires are hunting the werewolves which easily hide right in front of them in the shadows.  Apparently vampires have trouble seeing in shadows (or maybe werewolves have some power we don't know about)  It's obviously some gamer role play rule that they forget to explain.  (Yes, I played the vampire games and as I recall, I could see in the dark, in fact, I also could run fast)  Anyway, the whole thing is a gun fight in which some people who happen to be immortal, except that they are really easy to kill fight off super werewolves (the writer must have played a werewolf in the game)And what's with the knives?  Am I to believe that vampires in this world will fall over because someone pricks them with a knife?  Or is this more game play rule BS?  SPOILER - the lead gets stabbed by the lead werewolf whilst driving a car and passes out from blood loss.  FROM BLOOD LOSS! WTF???  She's supposed to be a vampire.  For chrissake, a knife in the shoulder would only p**s off most people I know.  Apparently vampires these days are particularly sensitive.So, it's an inconsistant, uninteresting, and a cheap remake of the matrix, with mad dogs.",Underworld
287,Nephalim,Not Good At All,1,2 October 2003,"*Minor Spoilers - don't worry, you spot them coming a mile away*Some of the fights were decent. The morphing thing on the werewolves was good. The costumes were interesting, if not a tad redundant, and the setting kept very gothic and fitting for most of the film.That is where the virtues of this film end.We have been waiting almost ten years for another decent vampire movie, and we keep getting cliched disappointment after another. Vampire culture barely factored into it. We hardly see them demonstrate any of their powers. This could very easily be about human werewolf-hunters, and the plot would need only a little tweaking. That aside, the plot was still quite bad. The avenging-murdered-family bit is getting very old and very tired and it's pulled off in uncreative enough a way not to give them the benefit of the doubt.When Selene (Beckinsale) and Mike (Speedman) inevitably fall in love, you begin to wonder why, as nothing has really happened that merits any feelings for one another. Their first kiss comes from out of nowhere. I realize this is primarily an action movie but let's put SOMETHING behind the relationships.That being said, the action sequences that were rewarding to watch were few and far between, and none of them involved Selene. Kate Beckinsale seems very out of place in a fight. And in the final battle, the death of the big bad guy is actually very comical, and the cinema I was in burst into laughter when he died, which I somehow doubt was the intent.
And finally, as a horror film, it doesn't even try to scare you. I can't see it being considered a horror film in any serious capacity.And as a detail, why didn't we just call them ""Werewolves"" instead of ""Lycans"" which sounds exactly like ""Lichens.""",Underworld
288,Scotti_de_Radeclyf,Fantastic Film,7,9 March 2006,"Billed by as a ""sleek, action thriller,"" this movie is ablaze in true Hollywood fashion with numerous rounds of bullets flying everywhere, but never hitting anything. For myself, this was a fantastic film with its ""Matrix""-style fight scenes kept to a bare minimum. With its special effects in general being toned down, the story of newly turned Lycanthrope, Michael (Scott Speedman), and Vampire Warrior, Selene the Death Dealer (Kate Beckinsale), shines through beautifully. With both the Vampires (aristocratic nobles) and the Lycans (street thugs) at war for centuries, it's said early on that the Lycans had stolen an ""ultraviolet bullet"" from a government group. While never actually stated in the movie, that government group would be the C.I.B. from the six episode British television series ""Ultraviolet"" (1998). On a somewhat related note, I have noticed here that Kate Beckinsale sports a hairstyle that gives her a striking resemblance to her late father, Richard Beckinsale of both ""Porridge"" (1973) and ""Rising Damp"" (1974) fame. I still remember our Assistant Manager coming to work after seeing this stating that she wanted to be like Selene when she grows up, and that was a good enough recommendation for me to see this one that I enjoyed thoroughly.",Underworld
289,lucky_star_1,"Underworld is everything it should be - Gothic, violent, scary, sexy",9,4 March 2007,"I give a lot of credit to Kate Beckinsale because she picks some very memorable and yet critical roles to play, which moreso than never she tends to pull off well. Her role as Selene in Underworld makes no exception - she really is quite amazing as the dark, brave, independent female vampire. As the protagonist, Kate plays a much better part than Angelina did in Tomb Raider, because it's more serious and in many ways more believable Given I don't think Underworld adds up to the brilliance of other horror movies like 28 Days Later (which REALLY scared me) and Interview with the Vampire, it's not that far behind. I agree with a lot of people who have said that it's better than Van Helsing. Mainly because Jackman was the only reason I watched that film and Beckinsale's accent was too much to bear in it. Underworld is a refreshing change and is quite a shocker, with some gruesome scenes. Beckinsale has chemistry with co-lead star Scott Speedman, and the Selene-Michael romance is clearly set to develop in the sequel. The whole vampire and werewolf falling in love thing is actually intriguing to watch.The eye candy's certainly not bad - for the women who are interested, Speedman and Shane Brolly who plays bad guy Kraven are more than a treat. Kraven certainly has his moments where he plays the jealous lover card, when he sees Michael with Selene.Overall, I thought it was a great movie, and I'll definitely be watching the sequel. I disregard all the negative comments because they don't fit with my opinion of the film. I've always loved Vampire movies and so this one was a treat",Underworld
290,ruddy_jim,A solid action film that flounders,7,2 May 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3/4 of this film. The acting, writing and direction were all up to the level of quality expected for the genre.Kate Beckinsale as Selene was a solid performer, with the wonderful cast surrounding her doing a solid job portraying the mostly one dimensional characters in the huge cast. Len Wiseman's direction was surprisingly good and (in general) the writing leaves nothing to be desired.The story did seem to flounder a little towards the end. I suspect if they could have fleshed out the Viktor character a bit more it would have helped, but regardless I really must rate this movie a solid 7.",Underworld

In a movie about a war between Vampires and Lycans, I want to see some great action scenes and Underworld delivers. But you get more than just good action; you get a great looking movie. I absolutely loved the dark dingy look throughout the entire movie. There isn't much color but that's the point. I think they also did a great job in the costume/makeup department. The Vampires look believable but not overdone and I love the Lycans. The acting was so-so and the story while not bad in my opinion was nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a stylized, fun, action movie, then this one is definitely worth a shot. O yea, and Kate Beckinsale is in it. Need I say more?",Underworld
292,halopes,For fans only.,6,27 January 2004,"I'm not a huge fan of the vampires and werewolves universes. Though, every once in a while, I can enjoy a vampire or werewolf vs. human picture, particularly when there's a siege situation. Not being a fan of the myths, it's easy for me to identify with the fellows in trouble. If the approach to these legendary themes is easy or mockingly I can let myself go without major tribulations. UNDERWORLD takes itself too serious for its own good.My main problem with this movie is that it is a story about vampires and werewolves, nothing more, a battle between both clans. There's nothing here for people who don't love vampires and werewolves. Although the special effects are pretty impressive and Len Wiseman's direction is technically flawless, it came a point in the movie where I couldn't identify with any character, thus the movie became boring and extremely overlong. The action sequences weren't enough to lift up the movie because I just couldn't care about the story. Therefore, the special effects and fight sequences had a void, meaningless effect in me. The same is true for the nice, dark cinematography and the rich, gothic set design.Maybe it's just me, since I can even recognize this movie had a good premise: a legendary battle between vampires and werewolves. But if it weren't for the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, in non-sexy mode here, probably I wouldn't have paid half the attention I did to this movie.",Underworld

Underworld isn't the greatest, but it does a fine job of creating a dark world full of mystery and action.  At time the plot threads are a little tangled, but I think that adds to the overall immersion in the vampire/werewolf world.My two main gripes were the werewolves when they ran on the walls and ceilings.  Supernatural or not, it looked stupid.  And the final scene death scene of Victor, specifically the delayed action decapitation is a total copy of the Kurgan's death in Highlander.Oh one last gripe.  Michael's super powerful were-vamp transformation was also a big let down.  My imagination had some combination of Giger's alien integrated with bat and human features.  Overall though, the best classic horror genre flick since Brotherhood of the Wolf and Gingersnaps.",Underworld

Sheen is an excellent actor with an impressive list of diverse roles including recently portraying Tony Blair in ""The Queen. Sophia Myles is currently playing in ""Moonlight"" a vampire series on CBS, I guess the genre fit her.

I can't even remember another example where almost every main actor's performance is closer to high school drama (I wish!) than such big production. Kate Beckinsale is great. As always. She suits the role and she LOOKS. Special effects are among the best I've seen - and what is most important - in most cases they look very transparent. In case of this one particular movie I really look forward for a sequel (and I hate sequels), because almost all those ""bad-acting characters"" are killed. So - unless it will NOT be a prequel and if SFX will not be overdone (like in Blade II) - it can only be better. I'm a huge fan of vampires so - still 8/10. It's just really better than the average (but it COULD be HUGE).",Underworld

298,anicerman,Another worthseeing thriller,7,5 January 2007,"As the debut of Len Wiseman as a director and writer I would say he's got a lot of potential. The plot is overall imaginative and thrilling.During a mission, Selene, a human-turned-into vampire death dealer, finds that the Lycans (werewolves) are not threatened with extinction and Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, is not dead as the vampires believe and they are after a human, Michael Corvin. As she gets closer to the truth she discovers the secrets of their chasing Michael and Kraven betrays his species to Lucian. She then wakes Viktor, the elder she respects the most, up for help.The plot surely keeps itself going and makes you want to see how it goes. Each character is very distinctive and remarkable and contributes to the development of the story. However, a very important point doesn't make sense to me at all. According to the rule of ""the older the stronger"" for the vampires, how can Amelia be killed that easily? She's the third oldest.A non-mainstream element I noticed is the thing that the Lycans fear - silver as it's supposed to be fatal to vampire in most of the vampire stories. Anyway it's just a kind of imaginative thing so I'm not going to criticise that.The action part of the film is just fair as people are just ""fighting"" or firing shots (that's why I call it a thriller instead of an action thriller). Yet it's still interesting to see the war between vampires and werewolves goes modern that way.You won't see good acting in this film as the performance of most of the actors/actresses is just fair. Kate is too clever to act well but the character is quite suitable for her. Shane as Kraven and Bill as Viktor tend to overact especially Shane as you'll see him talking so strongly in most of the scenes.Despite the performance of the cast, the film is overall worth-watching and better than other many-million-dollars films.",Underworld

300,Film-gourmet,World of Darkness,7,16 January 2015,"If you are interested in RPGs like myself, you've probably heard World of Darkness. This movie is basically a setting based on WoD. There are some positive and negative elements about this movie. The first half of the movie was mostly positive but it gets worse until the end.*Story: Whether or not plagiarized from other materials (which is a disputed issue) it's a good story. Missions, betrayal, twists most of them leaves you with awe. There are some boring details about story however they don't get in the way of sequences.*Setting: Dark world, everlasting night, war between lycans and vampires that's been raging on for centuries. Each have their characteristics and features. Immersive...*Meaningless action sequences: I'm okay with action as long as it doesn't become absurd. Selene; without prior tactics, armed with only pistols killing 6 werewolves who are armed with assault rifles and ambushing her behind a door. People who are not main characters are shooting with precision of a deaf bat. There are lots of scenes like this, get used to it. Of course, Selene dropping to lower floor by shooting the ground and pack of lycans are not chasing after her; let's not forget that scene.*Illogical details: Why is Viktor and Marcus who are the strongest vampires, lay in the catacombs defended only by one ordinary vampire who can be easily distracted by saying: ""Hey, uh, Kraven is looking for you.""? If vampires are meticulous about purity of their species and bloodlines why there is a black vampire managing the weapon department? Why, for the love of god, nobody awakened an elder vampire before and why Selene did it because of some paranoid thought which would most likely end up ""Oops, I awakened you before your time, sorry about that."" and cost her life.Little details like these makes the movie's second half and some parts of first half insufferable, absolutely trash details. This could have been a masterpiece, but instead it chose to be an ordinary action film with an extraordinary setting.",Underworld

She has been added to one of my favorite actress since. I always liked vampire and werewolf movies, but this is the most fantastic i ever seen. With this great dark picture and the great soundtrack. This genre of rock music relates perfect to this thriller. It makes the whole movie really Gothic and i like that.Selene who has hunted werewolves for many hundred years is now ready to make her mission bigger when she meets the future-hybrid Michael Corvin. Michael is protected by her, but he doesn't know that its time for his life to protect her from future danger.I love all of the characters and especially this fascinated story about the fights between werewolves and vampires and which side who will survive the war. I don't think anyone could play better as these actors here. And they could have been won more awards for their incredible job at this movie. My favorite scenes was when Mickael turned into the hybrid at the end and when Selene finally killed Victor, when he tried to kill Michael.

I watched the first few minutes of it, hoping and praying for a good plot. No doubt Rob Zombie (this movie is based on one of his ideas) loves action. If you love action, this movie is right up your alley. If you love plot, this movie isn't for you. Beckinsale is a good actress, sure, but this movie just wasn't right for her. The most interesting part, as far as plot is concerned, is when the audience finds out what started the war between the werewolves and vampires. Other than that, it's like playing some sort of video game. BANG. BOOM. BANG. It's also stupid when Beckinsale slices off the lead vampire's head--he doesn't even feel it!

304,Viz79,Easily the best pure vampire movie I have seen,10,19 September 2003,"Before I went into see this movie, I was a little.. concerned, simply because of a couple of reviews I had seen. The trailers seemed like a dream because of the style and the content which I found really appealing. Come on, werewolves, vampires in a dark gothic setting battling it out.. if done well it could be a masterpiece.It is a masterpiece I can tell you now - never does it bore, but the story does captivate you, continues to twist and in the end it would be very odd if you were not satisfied on the storyside. The cinematography is again superb, giving you classic slightly grey view of everything and even openly shows some cliched gothic backdrops to indicate that it is very much the world that you would have thought of.The acting is more than adequate for something like this but the visual effects are great as well - it is not the Matrix and only shows the 'slow down' scene twice in the entire movie, yet the action is always interesting as you follow it all on screen.At the end of the day, I felt I was there, in a world where vampires and lycans existed and where at each others throats for their own reasons. And if this movie managed to achieve that, and had me coming out of the movie going 'wow that was superb.. Ill be watching that again, I want the DVD and I hope desperately for a sequel' you know you have something special.",Underworld

Unfortunately, this movie does not deliver in what could have been, and should have been, one of the coolest vampire/werewolf movies ever made.The whole movie seemed to meander, even in the action scenes. I think there wasn't enough time dedicated to the screenplay, though it seems like the storyline and backstory had been well thought out. This led to the feeling that a lot was implied but left out.Beckinsale looks great in her catsuit and cape, the sets were simple and stayed in the background, but the special effects left a lot to be desired. The werewolf transformations were terrible, and not much more advanced than those in ""American Werewolf in London."" I think they should have sped it up just a little bit more and that might have passed muster. I think it was silly that the professional vampire ""Death Dealers"" would stand around in the middle of a fight and wait a few seconds for their opponent to transform into a werewolf. It would have been better to have the transformation occur in the middle of combat, allowing the editor to cut a lot and break the special effect up into more believable bits.I recommend that if you are a vampire and/or werewolf fan, go ahead and rent this move, but please don't spend $20 on it, or you will regret it.",Underworld
308,Adrian-34,Great! [SPOILERS],10,9 February 2004,"I think this movie was just GREAT!  The story was solid and interesting though not excessively complicated or intrguing.  The jist of the story is that a 1,000 year plus war has been waged between vampires and werewolves. You really don't find out why for sometime so you'll need to be patient. It's the best vampire movie I've seen in a LOOOOOOOONG time!That's not to say it was perfect.  On the contrary, it certainly could have used some polishing.  One thing that annoyed me about this movie was that everyone, and that means 99% of the cast, wore black or red even the vampires home was all black, red and white.  The flashback scenes were annoing but tolerable for most.  I don't like some of the techniques used today so most won't have a problem with it.  Beckinsale was great in the role but I think the character needed more developing.  Her rough, ""I've been so hurt"" edge made her look emotionless, cold and for the most part disinteresting.  You walk away feeling you never really knew the character at all.  When Selene and Michael fall in love the first thing you wonder is how?!  He certainly could not know much about her especially at that point. In fact you are not sure how Kahn, who seems to be her closest friend (which is not saying much), became her confidant at all.  The romance of Selene and Michael is not buyable and almost suffocates the love story of Lucian and Sonja's love tragedy.  The latter probably being one of the film's redeeming points albeit a brief one.Some people complained about the fact that they had no idea where the tale takes place and that werewolves can climb walls/ceilings, vampires can see their reflections, etc.,  This didn't bother me but I don't see a need to assume folklore must be adhered to in a movie.  They were not killed by traditional means either.  It's thereby safe to assume that these vampires, whether other worldly or not, are simply not of the same variety that we know.  I don't think it is that big of an issue or a deal.  The one thing along this line though which did trouble me was that with the strengths and powers of the vampires compared with that of the werewolves it is simply amazing that the previous survived as long as they had as it seemed the werewolves had the out ranked in abilities.Still, though it may not sound it, I genuinely loved it and highly recommend it to any horror fan.

Well, my wife wanted to see it, so who was I to deny her. :)Plus, I thought the whole supernatural gang-war concept pretty interesting. 
Where the movie worked the most for me was presenting a story that didn't allow the effects to define the story...well, like the Matrix Reloaded unfortunately did to stupefyingly boring results.The story had me attentive throughout and I found myself actually caring about the characters, even ones that on the surface seemed like baddies.The biggest barometer for me is whether I'd be willing to see a sequel, Underworld 2 would have me in the seats.",Underworld
313,keith96778,Really draining (Warning: Minor spoilers),6,28 September 2003,"This isn't much of a movie.  Nothing too innovative.  Special effects are mediocre.The premise doesn't make much sense, but suspending belief is all part of the game for horror fans.  Not a whole lot made much sense, actually, but this movie put more premium on action than logic.  Unfortunately, even the action was too phony. The many (many) gun battles were bizarre.  When you've got 4 guys with automatic weapons blasting at somebody six feet away, you'd expect them to hit the target once in a while. Plus, since the wolfies developed some pretty effective vampire bullets, it didn't make a lot of sense for them to spend so much time biting and howling.  Good fun for them, I am sure, but a nice ultraviolet bullet between the eyes would've been much more practical.  Nonetheless, they managed to rip apart a goodly number of vampires as silver bullets ripped into their fuzzy little hides.  As I surveyed the carnage, it became apparent that immortality is not a big impediment to dying.
The movie is obviously setting up one or more sequels.  They will stink, too. Ironically, the thought of a second one is scarier than seeing the first one.As it was, I left the movie feeling drained.

314,Mykewood,"If you liked blade, you'll love this!",10,23 September 2003,"This movie is a good take on the old original story of werewolves & vampires.  Werewolves were the daytime protectors of the vampires.  But something happened that caused them to become mortal enemies & started a 1000-year war.  There isn't a lot of direct character development, but that would have slowed the movie down.  It's much like the 1st Matrix, enough action at the beginning to get you interested, then they tell the story so you have an understanding of what's going on, then they get back to the action.  The character development is subtler, in that you discover the inner workings of Selena as she does.  In this type of story it works.  You can't go into this movie expecting Terms of Endearment or Casablanca.  It is what it is, an action/horror flick.  It does the action very well; the horror part is more shock value then actual horror, like most so-called horror movies these days.  The acting is decent.  Nobody really stands out as far as the acting, good or bad, which I like, because it keeps 1 character from dominating the film.  All the characters I thought blended well into the story.  So you care more about what's going on, then who is doing what.  I give it a 10 out of 10.  Because it is very good in its genre, it's the best sci-fi/action movie since Matrix.  I recommend it to any action movie buff.  I if you liked Blade, you'll love this!",Underworld

After seeing it, I was wrong. Underworld has a deep storyline if one pays attention to historical information presented by the characters and leaves a lot of possibilities for graphic novels and decent off shoot movies or sequels.  If you ignore the plot and just watch the action, Underworld doesn't rise above in that area but it doesn't fall off the ladder.

But not: Oh my God, this is so good I want more and I want to buy the DVD and stuff. I think the reason why it doesn't do that much to me is that I love different characters, I love personalities and I love to get stuck in the movie. Through this whole movie you don't get to know any character that well, except for Lucian who is, because he is the only one that shows some characteristics, my favorite character. Selene is a dull, non-smiling, grumpy girl and she falls in love with this lycan-vamp hybrid guy. I don't even know why, because the only time they spent together is running away from things and being suspicious of each other. There are about 5 characters that you get to know a little, the rest are just background people that only sit around or get killed. They could have done so much more with this!Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it enough to watch the other 3 parts, but I seriously hope that there are more characters with actual emotions and stories and personalities so I can get carried away with this movie. I watched this while checking Facebook every ten minutes and when I am really into a movie the rest of the world doesn't exists for me. I love the gloomy atmosphere and I love that it is a two-sided story: the enemy can be both vampire or lycan, so you get to pick which clan you love better. I like the action in it, but at the end of the movie I think it takes a little too long and I was really itching to stand up the last ten minutes. So: it's nice to watch every now and then but I don't think that it's a master piece.",Underworld
318,Anarchy7451,A wonderful horror/action movie,10,7 July 2005,"Underworld, directed by Len Wiseman and stars the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, is a worth-watcher. I watched this movie around Christmas time (ironic, isn't it?)and it gave me nightmares and pleasant dreams (nightmares - Lycans and vampires biting my flesh and sucking my blood out through silly straws/pleasant dreams - Selene naked). I thought it was quite a nice and intriguing flick. This movie basically talks about the war between Lycans (werewolf things) and vampires (blood-sucking horrors). A beautiful vampire (Beckinsale)meets a werewolf (Scott Speedman) who holds some kind of key to the end of the war and together, they battle the evil Lucian (Michael Sheen). I honestly have to say that I've wet my pants many times throughout the film so check it out, if you DARE!",Underworld

It has good special effects and a good story line and characters you love and hate.The main characters are Selene (Vampire Death Dealer ) and Micheal ( Half breed between the 2 species.Selene is like a daughter to the main Vampire leader VIKTOR. He's full of attitude and all others respect him. I was disappointed when they killed him off after his fight with Micheal and Selene.The storyline was okay in places but they should'nt of killed all the council members, so they could arrive at the mansion and judge Selene for awaking viktor and seeing Kraven judged for his alliance with Lucian ( Head of the Lycan Clan).I'm looking forward to the 2nd movie in the series, i've read thats its going to be a prequel, so Viktor will be in it, but really in my opinion they should have let him live.Great music and costumes and fight scenes.",Underworld
320,Out-Break,Underworld Was GRRRRRRREAT!!!,10,26 August 2005,"I saw this film on DVD first, came over it by accident while i was bored at my grandmothers. But my god when i finished that film i just had to watch it again, and again, and again.It was pure genius, and this kind of a film coming from Len Wiseman where this was his first real directing job, i mean wow he can direct. I loved the whole story the Hybrid theory as it was, the fact that no one has ever really thought 'What if you crossed a Werewolf sorry lycan with a Vampyre'.And you can relate to every person, Lycan or Vampyre. You have Raze a big brute of a Lycan but who solemnly pledges his allegiance to Lucian and Lucian the leader small in size but that doesn't stop him from casting his long shadow over his many minions. Then you have Selene, unbelievably beautiful yet dangerous, and Viktor the most powerful Vampyre by far, his stance alone can scare anyone or anything into cowering.OK so Speedman kinda sucked, but the simple fact that Beckinsale and Knighy where absolutely awesome just completely overpowers your urge to rein hate on Speedman. And the special effects weren't half bad either, there were a few bits where you could see the transition to CGI or suited guys. And the gun fight at the start, when i first watched it i was kinda to enthralled and of course loved it, and i love every scene to this day, but my god that subway scene shows that Lycans and Vampyres cant aim at all.But again all the bad points were completely washed away by the good. This is a great film and easily re watchable material. If you like the whole Vampire, werewolf's scenario you're going to love this, if you don't, well.............. you're still going to love it.This is one of my favourite films of all time, and i cant wait for the sequel",Underworld

The concept and premise of this movie was just horrible. They tried to make something revolutionary like the Matrix but just with Vampires and Werewolves. I don't know why, but I really hate this movie, I like vampires and Werewolves (which they call Lycans in the movie) but this movie is just ridiculous. I failed to see what was so beautiful and amazing about this movie. It was stupid. I hated the plot, though it sounded a bit original and kind of promising, It wasn't. I haven't seen the sequel yet, I don't plan on it, so I have to say this is the only movie I will dare give a one to because I hated it to the core.Sorry if this sounds more like a rant, but I just do not care for this movie.

322,MrEricSir,Bela Lugosi's Dead,1,29 September 2003,"Now don't get me wrong -- an epic battle between vampires and werewolves has a lot of potential for a cool movie.  After all, werewolves are big, hairy monsters with claws, and vampires are effeminate pale-skinned people who wear stylish clothes and have a thirst for blood.Unfortunately, when the vampires can't fly and cast visible reflections, and the werewolves' only superhuman ability involves running at highway speeds, one has to wonder -- what kind of vampires and werewolves ARE these?But the movie quickly answers this question by reducing all the significance of the two creatures to molecular biology.  Oh, you thought vampires were really the undead?  Pfft.At least the audience can empathise with the pain and suffering of the war-wounded by means of the painfully wooden acting, and the suffering caused by exposure to yet another Romeo and Juliet ""forbidden love"" story ripoff.Bela Lugosi's dead... and so are cool monster movies.",Underworld
323,suburbannightmare,pretty.....but not beautiful.,4,4 November 2006,"I wanted to like this film the minute I heard it was in production. A story set in the present, smack-dab in the middle of a war between vampires and werewolves. OK, what's not to like about that idea? Well, nothing really. Underworld delivers a huge slice of supernatural warfare with amazing style  from guns that use ultraviolet bullets, to of course, Kate Beckinsale dealing death with two huge guns whilst slinking about in a black leather cat suit. So admittedly, the movie looks amazing. But that's really about itDuring the latest skirmish, Seline (Kate Beckinsale), one of the vampire coven's elite Deathdealers discovers that the Lycans are trying to capture a human (Scott Speedman). Seline sets out to find him before the Lycans do, and discover their purpose.To be fair, this movie has many good points. It looks amazing, the sets are ipeccably atmospheric and the action scenes are short enough to keep your attention. There are also some good performances here. Kate Beckinsale, if you can get past her constant frowning is very watchable as Seline, although she does adopt a rather annoying monolithic pout as soon as she gets a gun in her hand. (She's almost like 'The Matrix's' Trinity. Except with longer hair, bigger guns andwell, fangs.) Bill Nighy does quite a menacing turn as the vampire coven's Elder, Viktor. He's almost fatherlike in some ways, and his scenes with his vampire daughter Seline are reminiscent of a Father rebuking a wayward child. But other times he's sinister as hell. Shane Brolly's Kraven, although slick and sophisticated, begins to grate on the nerves. (By the end, his whining and foot stamping make one want to administer a few swift kicks to his face) Disappointingly, Lucien and Michael seem to fade into the background a bit, despite being central to the movie's plot.The whole movie though, is as slick as it gets; kind of an ultra-modern film noir. The exterior shots are made up of imposing buildings, moody back streets and perpetual downpour (Not a good advertisement for Hungary where the movie was filmed, eh?) and the whole movie is stylishly faded and muted. For a vampire vs. werewolf film though, the gore factor was (sadly) rather understated, and although the battle scenes are quite good, the whole pace seems to stagger about a bit, almost as if there's too much story to try and cram into the time available. The story is a good idea, but by the end I'd lost interest; mainly because the movie looks good, but there isn't that much else to it. Which is a shame as the plot could make for an amazing movie. But alas, it seems to rely too heavily on it's looks and it's main starafter all, gorgeous as Kate Beckinsale is, there's only so long one can wear a leather catsuit without looking silly.",Underworld
324,bdavis-5,It's 1980s B Movie!,8,20 September 2003,"5/10. Never mind any positive reviews to the contrary, this is not a good movie! It is better than, say, ""Red Sonja"", but not by too much. I don't have the time to describe everything that is wrong about this movie, and I'm only writing this much because I am shocked at the amount of positive response on this site to date. The biggest problem with Underworld is that not enough is done to establish sympathy and interest in the characters, apart from Selene. The premise of the conflict is set forth, the scenarios and fights are played out, the twists and secrets are revealed, the climatic fight is staged - and I barely care, apart from Selene. Even then, I only except Selene because of Kate Beckinsale's striking allure that stems from her combination of sultry beauty, fine intelligence, and faultless acting. She actually has little to do in the way of emoting, but she does her emoting well. It isn't her fault that there is almost no indication of romantic interest from her or Scott Speedman until the script calls for a kiss to establish it. It isn't her fault that this is a continuous melodrama with no significant break for comedy or romance. (Then again, she lacks enough taste to be engaged to the director of this dog.) My friend Katja put it this way: she has seen better character development in video games. And the score was inconsistent, loud, and mostly lousy. The trailers for this movie are indeed far superior to the product they have been promoting. This is not surprising after one takes a look at the director's resume on this very site and considers that the producers of the trailers probably have more filmmaking experience than he does. And there are plenty of other problems, but, as I said, I don't have the time.However, I'll admit that there are other good things about it. Bill Nighy as Victor was impressive. Victor's awakening may have supplied one of the most memorable scenes in vampire movie history. And the Budapest Fire Department are real heroes for staying up night after night to supply the film crew with rain water for every single scene in the movie. (It's a gothic, 1980s B-movie, after all.)",Underworld

326,ixtoploplcatl,A few new notes to an old story,7,19 September 2003,"The movie isn't bad, which is also to say it isn't great.  Somewhat better than the average offering in the sub-genre.  Maybe it's that it tries too much to blend the gritty-city sets of the Nicholson-Keaton Batman, with the sexy vampires of the Anne Rice trend, with all the cool gadgetry of the Blade series.  The story does add some nice twists to the usual bland perspectives on the beasties, and it certainly doesn't hurt to have Kate Beckinsale running around in patent leather, butt-hugging pants.  So it's down to goth/s&m vampires versus the lycans (simply because it is too much effort to say ""Lycanthropes"").  I sided with the Werewolves early on, and it was nice to see them lauded for technological inventiveness, even thought they managed to do their fair share of dumb things.  The casting had some shiners and a few stinkers.  The costumes and sets were great.  The script may have *ahem* bitten off too much for a standard movie length.  Worth seeing, but only once. So the real question becomes: Will this movie make it trendy~cool to be a werewolf now? Gothlings and vamp-wanna-bees beware, there's a new big dog in town.",Underworld

I may review the Matrix one day, but figure I'll sharpen my fangs on this load first. How do I hate it, let me count the ways. If a movie can have a hot actress in black latex squatting, preening, glowering, and firing machine pistols in a manner that would puts Trinity to shame, why do I hate this film? If the plot can take a double helix turning spin, land on its feet, and prove very deft, why do I hate this film? If the acting is credible, effects are superior, and sets very credible, why do I hate this film? If I can love a good yarn about vampires and about werewolves, why do I hate this film? I think it because I knew I could watch it, and I knew that I was being marketed at, with all the warmth of a Roman Emporer giving the thumbs down at gladitorial combat. I'm on what's good about this film, although the makers wanted to sew clichés together to cover what is really a very minor story. I shouldn't mind so much, I did watch it from beginning to end, but I think that the film had next to no challenge to watch. Because it had no challenge, no engagement, I had no stake in it, I hated it. I want to know that something can entertain, enlighten, uplift. This film can only spin boredom into something that should have been half of every thing that it ultimately became.

It seems to have been shot entirely in Hungary, or otherwise eastern european location, giving it a lovely, gothic look, as well as a neutral setting. (My only gripe here would be the product placement for Bacardi! How does that fit in with this crazy flick?)A convoluted plot posing vampires against werewolves in an eternal battle between races of immortals greets us here.  The action is fairly well staged, and the VFX, while maybe a little cheaper than what some of us are used to, nevertheless gives the movie a style and look that many more expensive pictures miss out on.  The acting is a little ropey sometimes, as is the slightly bonkers script, but overall the movie works - and Beckinsale holds things together when it seems all is lost.If you like Blade, Buffy and The Matrix, then this is a fine way to spend the evening.

336,Jax0524,Best scifi fantasy vampire film I've ever seen,8,8 July 2009,"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. After seeing other vampire films like the Blade trilogy or 30 days of night I was really disappointed with them. It was hard for me to find an enjoyable vampire/werewolf movie until this came along then I decided to give it a shot. I was happy with it, I really liked the idea of vampire vs. werewolves. When I saw this film I had no interest in Kate Beckinsale what so ever although she was fun to watch kick butt on screen. Unfortunately there were some problems that I had with her character Selene and Scott Speedsman who plays Michael Corvin, which I will talk about momentarily. I was more interested in the characters Viktor (Bill Nighy), Kraven (Shane Brolly), and Lucian (Michael Sheen). Lucian was my favorite I sympathized with him way more than any of the other characters on screen. Even though in the beginning of the film we get the impression that Lucian is the bad guy; as we get further along in the film you begin to realize that he is in fact the hero and a victim. You understand his reasons for doing the things he does. I was really interested in learning more about Lucian's past so I was really happy when Underworld Rise of the Lycans was released but thats another review.Now here come the things that I hated. First off let me just say that I absolutely can't stand when the writers of a film try to force a relationship between the two main characters in a film. I can't stand it. A perfect example of this would be Neo and Trinity from the matrix films and this one. Usually when I watch a film and the writers decide to throw in a love story I have to ask myself this one specific question What are the characters reasons for liking each other? what do they mean to one another? If this question isn't answered then we have a problem. The relationship between Michael Corvin and Selene in this film was so rushed and forced that I didn't believe for a second that these two were so into each other not to mention the character Michael was so undeveloped it was ridiculous. it was hard to even call him a character he was more of a plot device, there was nothing to really like about him. Michael and Selene fell in love because the plot needed them to, there is no attraction between these characters. Having the two main characters pointlessly hook up only gives the writers the excuse to write a pointless sex scene in the sequel(see Underworld Evolution).Other than this I thought this was a really good film. Its a movie you would watch on a rainy day when there's nothing else on TV.",Underworld

338,nichomach,A rattling good yarn...,8,28 June 2007,"Strong performances, a taut storyline and well-handled direction make this an excellent action film. Beckinsale shines as Selene, and Nighy's turn as Viktor has me halfway convinced that he actually IS a creature of the night. The effects are thorough without being intrusive, and there's no sense of ""CGI overload"". Scott Speedman handles the role of Michael well, conveying the character's disorientation and confusion excellently, as well as bringing real presence to the dénouement. I'm going to mention Beckinsale again, because she's simply fabulous; coolly distant one minute, furiously impassioned the next, she brings a welcome range and depth to a role that could so easily have been botched (sorry Alba, there's only one Dark Angel, and she drives a Maserati... *grin*). A film that doesn't pretend to be anything other than excellent entertainment, and it doesn't have to. Thoroughly enjoyable throughout.",Underworld
339,MrLuthor89,One of the Best Action Thrillers in Years...,10,25 January 2006,"Vampire and Werewolf movies have been seen constantly throughout the years, from classics like ""Dracula"" and ""The Wolf Man"" to the awful ""Van Helsing"", the terrible ""Cursed"", and the truly rancid ""Dracula 2000"". Underworld provides a new, updated, edgier, and sexier approach to such long-running genres. The film combines incredible special effects (done with little money), stylishly Gothic sets and costume designs (full of black and dark bluesgotta love it), and a stellar cast of actors that include Kate Beckisnale, Scott Speedman, and Bill Nighy. The film starts with vampire and ""death dealer"", Selene (Kate Beckinsale), telling us of the long running war between Vampire and Lycan and its unknown origins to how it all began. The vampire empire is controlled by three elders, two of which stay asleep while one remains above to rule, thus alternating every century. The current elder awake is Amelia (Zita Görög), while powerful and feared leaders like Viktor (Bill Nighy) and Marcus (later played by Tony Curran) reside in protected covens. These covens are run by the greedy and untrustworthy Kraven (Shane Brolly).The Coven is shaken when the Lycan begin hunting a certain human by the name of Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), for an unknown scientific purpose. It is shaken further when Selene believes that the thought-to-be-dead Lycan leader, Lucian (Michael Sheen) may very well be alive, and in league with Kraven. After rescuing Michael from both sides, Selene sacrifices her good name in the Coven to uncover the conspiracy. Selene awakens her father-figure elder, Viktor in order to bring justice to the treacherous Kraven. Unfortunately, at first, Viktor would not be able to look past her insubordination and disregard for the laws that he so heavily believed in. From there, the truth of the conspiracy unfolds, involving the creation of a hybrid, the betrayal of a colleague, and the descendant to the father of all immortalsAlexander Corvinus (later played by Derek Jacobi).While many would say this film looks like ""The Matrix"" and plays out like a typical horror film, they obviously haven't sat through the entire film. This movie not only provides action, blood, gore, sex appeal, and solid entertainment, but it also balances all of that with a firm storyline. A storyline that sets up an epic tale of lies, deception, and deadly blood feuds (forgive the pun). The visuals are also paralleled with a myriad of fantastic performances. Kate Beckinsale owns the character of Selene. She is sexy, violent, tender when she needs to be, and an overall bada$$. Speedman was perfect as the human caught up in a supernatural conspiracy that can cost him his life, or make him a God. Finally, there is, of course, my favorite performance of Bill Nighy as Viktor. Nighy is an underrated genius of an actor, and, although he is in only in a small percentage of the 2 hour film, he steals the show. While he fathers Selene and lays down the law in the Vampire world, you can't help but like him (especially when he grabs the enormous Lycan character of Raze by the neck, only to kill him easily), but the revelation of his true character only adds to Nighy's brilliant, suave, and menacing performance. Shane Brolly, Michael Sheen, and Erwin Leder played their roles out to perfection as well (although I think Shane Brolly could lighten up on his facial expressions). This film is epic, exciting, and overall just a damn good movie. After you see this you will be dying to see the sequel, which I also highly recommend.",Underworld

This movie doesn't attempt to take this genre any where different.After establishing that, what's the movie like? Well I'll be honest, it is entertaining!The plot itself is a bit sketchy at times, and even though the reasons for the war are explained it doesn't really explain the history between the two species that well.The acting for the most part is ok, even though some characters appear a bit wooden. The action scenes are quite well done and are entertaining to watch with pretty good special effects to make them more effective.

Kate Beckinsale, i think, fit the role. It's good to see her outside the chick-flick type movies.

The costumes were well chosen, and the actors were awesome as vamp's (especially Zita Gorog, he he). Kate Beckinsale shows us that British actors can kick butt just as well as American and I think that her accent suits the role. Some of the CGI was a bit iffy, but it is 4 years old.

However, after the 1st action sequence on the subway I knew this movie would be s***e.  It is trying to be a mix of the matrix and blade but it fails miserably.  The fighting in this movie is very badly choreographed, and the action is even worse.  It's like Commando, where the bad guys just jump out from around the corner to be shot and the good guys have hundreds of bullets shot at them and are never hit.  I really wanted this movie to be good but found it lacking on every level.  Characters suck, story sucks, acting sucks, cliched, etc.  Some dialogue made me laugh when I wasn't supposed to, and the Vampires love baring their teeth and making that hissing sound throughout this movie.  How cheesy. If you want a good vampire flick, watch Near Dark, the Blade movies, or Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. ** out of *****",Underworld
346,norale,Cool Mod Vamp Flick,10,6 June 2004,"Ugh, aren't you sick of these vampire flicks where they're all magical and violate the laws of physics? I was too and not expecting much when I saw this movie but it rocked!Selene the vamp is a death dealer killing Lycans (guess Len Wiseman doesn't know his Latin very well) she tracks two and finds they're following a human. She saves him but he gets bitten. Why doesn't she kill him when she finds out he's becoming a wolfie? Because it's Scott Speedman and you would never kill him.It's dark but not archaic and artfully done. Another thing I love, it's the first action flick with a female lead I've ever seen where she doesn't wear stiletto heels, a push up bra, doesn't have to show her, um, wits, and play dumb. She just kicks butt and doesn't apologize for it.If you like imaginative action and want some entertainment for a few hours dig this movie! This is one of my top 10 movies of all time but it probably won't be yours. Still it is soooooo much better than most of the crap we had in 2003 and from the looks of it 2004.",Underworld
347,lexy_dupont,An interesting idea but final product is lacking,5,27 January 2005,"Underworld could have been an interesting and unusual movie which combined the genres of action and horror in a unique way and which successfully explored its rich subtext (class and racial tension). However, the movie's script is so weak and poorly developed that it's just a little glue holding together a bunch of action set pieces. The acting is all over the map, ranging from very good (Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy as the leaders of the werewolves and vampires, respectively, who manage to give their characters much more depth and dignity than you would think possible given the script) to downright horrible (Shane Brolly--watching his scenes with Sheen is like seeing some sort of class demonstration of how to do a B movie villain badly and how to do one well). As a strict action movie, Underworld doesn't entirely succeed either because its action sequences are hit or miss--some are quite cool (vampires jumping off of buildings and crawling on the ceiling) while others are shot confusingly, so poorly lit you can't even see what's happening or just plain boring (Kate Beckinsale standing stock still while shooting at something off camera, and then moving a few feet and doing it again...and again).",Underworld
348,moviebuff201,Have you seen a hotter vamp than Kate Beckinsale?,10,31 March 2006,"This movie was so cool. When I first rented it, I only watched it because my friends said it was totally awesome. I watched it and I realized that they are right! Kate Beckinsale ignites the screen as Selene, a Death Dealer who hunts the werewolves with ruthless efficiency. Clad in black leather and toting some kick-ass guns, she plays the part beautifully. Then she meets Michael, played by Scott Speedman, a med student working in Budapest, who is bitten by a lycan (werewolf) and soon realizes that Michael is connected somehow to the lycans. Selene now realizes that the leader of the lycan hordes, Lucian, who was supposedly murdered by Kraven, a vampire in love with Selene, is still alive, she awakens a Master Vampire, Viktor, to stop the Lycans from becoming all-powerful and destroying the Vampires. With lots of guns, cool action, and a leather-clad super sexy Kate Beckinsale, this movie is tons of fun to watch! See it by all means!",Underworld
349,IcePirat,Good but moderately flawed.,6,5 October 2003,"Perhaps it was my fault, but I expected so much more out of this movie. First of all, how hard is it to pronounce the full name of lycanthrope?  I guess because vampire has two syllables, lycans have to have two as well. Second, I am beginning to think end-of-the-movie voice overs are the work of the devil.  The visual and the voice-over at the end here are contradictory. ***spoiler***Third, NOT A SINGLE VAMPIRE GOT SHOT! during the whole movie.

The violence in this movie, while scarce, is very extreme (e.g. face being torn with bloody results,a beheading,gunfights)but makes sense for the to species. There is very little language with only three uses of the F-word and one of the S-word.This is a a fairly long movie with a lot of detail and a lot of long conversations, this is the only reason I only gave this movie a nine instead of a ten.Iwould definitely recommend this movie to anyone, and I have yet to see the sequel, I am waiting for it on DVD.",Underworld
351,instigate_insanity,It's got Kate Beckinsale in it. What more incentive do you need?,7,25 July 2006,"Imagine you're a student of medicine, studying in a foreign country. Because of the fact that you're only a student, you don't really have much of a life outside the hospital, and you're there for basically fifteen hours a day. Now imagine that you discover that there's a whole other world overlaid against your own, and that the two dominant species of that world are creatures of myth and horror who have been engaged in war for the past six hundred years, and that recently you've become the central focus of their war, and both sides are out to either catch you for genetic experimentation or kill you.Unfortunately for Michael Corvin, it is exactly this series of events that take place. Heading off to work one evening, he is caught in the middle of a vicious gunfight in the subway system of the Hungarian city, Budapest, between a group of Vampire 'Death Dealers' (sorta like the Vampire version of SWAT) and a group of Lycanthropes (werewolves  Lycans, for short). This is merely the first in a series of events which will turn his life upside down, for to win the war, the Lycans require Michael's blood, and the Vampires require him dead.Selene has been a Death Dealer for the past three or four hundred years, ever since her family was killed and she was inducted into Vampirism. For hundreds of years she's fought the Lycans, who she believes to be responsible for her family's demise, with a single minded hatred. But now she's discovering things about her Vampire kin that are tearing down all her truths, and completely changing what were once incorruptible loyalties. And then there's Michael CorvinUnderworld is a stylishly cast action flick, with plenty of tense action sequences and blood, and yet it suffers from that unfortunate affliction which besets so many action movies  lack of storyline. There's plenty of possibility in a movie that almost makes the two hour mark, and yet there's no real development of any of the characters beside Selene, Michael and Lucian (and even then, there's disappointingly little). There's no real development of the plot, and some of the performances are less than impressive (case in point: Kraven, the Vampire Regent).Yet put aside the failures in the plot and you have a highly enjoyable action flick, and, of course, Kate Beckinsale (who spends most of the movie wearing extremely tight Matrix style leather which leaves nothing at all to the imagination) to drool over.

Kate Beckinsale is tight leather dark and Gothic Sounds good doesn't it? That's what I thought. And whilst this isn't the worst film I've seen by any stretch it missed something the O word originality.The story is simple. The war between Vampires and Lycan's (werewolves to you and me) has raged for hundreds of years on the dawn of the awakening, the fiendish Lycan's plot to kill to Vampires once and for all and there's some tosh about a pure cross blood line of the two species and Beckinsale getting off with a Werewolf.But the film is so done before Attractive woman spray painted into a leather one piece? The Matrix.Double Handed Gun Play? See John Woo.Vampires fighting with swords? Blade.High Angle rainy shots? Bound.Music? Matrix.Plot twists? Jackanory It's all so done before and often better.That's not to say the film lacks charm or style. It doesn't but like most else in the film what it has it borrows in spades and for the most part it has been done better and more expensively elsewhere.Beckinsale is sexy and this is probably one of her best roles yet, but Bill 'Love Actually' Nighy is so miscast and the guy from Snatch even more so.What they have done is take elements from bigger films and throw them together but with less of a cast and even less budget.Like those jeans you bought down the market. It may say Armani. It may look Armani. But deep down, you and everyone else will always know that's is nothing but a cheap knock off.Which for some people is fine but not to my taste.",Underworld

Victor´s eyes still making expresions when his brain has been cut! , excuse me but it is beyond, so unreal. Then the good: well I still think the movie is just awesome!!. The special efects(it´s truly difficult to find more less believable vampires and werewolves), the direction, Beckinsale´s acting, the characters are just great. And I totally love the story it contains love, hate, history, passion, fury, power, battle, everything. Loved the couple fighting against everything and creating peace among two clans.Going a bit more into the characters, these are very rich, each one has a story and a personality, there you have Erika showing a part of a woman´s nature and how the things that have to happen do no matter what because of the decisions, Lucian and Vicktor(that at some point even seems tender)develop wonderful. Even Kraven has something complicated going on. Speedman is cute and hot. I have always liked vampires and werewolves and these are some of the best I have seen. The action takes you to the edge.

However, unlike many others of its genre, I felt the action scenes were not overly done. I loved the costumes, and thought they fit the dark, surreal atmosphere well. The sets were fantastic with the dark and gloominess needed for the vampire/werewolf storyline. The filming worked really well, almost keeping a feeling unreality about every shot.But I have to admit there were a lot of things I didn't quite understand or wanted more of. While the sequel answered many of those questions, I still felt something was missing. It was. I bought the unrated director's cut...and it is *WAY* better than the original. The missing scenes do a lot to fill in holes, especially Erika's motives. It's sad though that we had to wait for a 2-disc edition to fill those holes. But ""Underworld,"" like many other films, looks like it fell victim to over-editing, losing many valuable plot points and character motivations along the way.If you haven't seen the director's cut or if you haven't seen ""Underworld"" at all, I would recommend just skipping the original version, and going right to the director's cut.

358,vilincica,Eye candy,8,19 December 2004,"First of all I am a vampire slash horror movie fan. I am and I'm proud to admit it. And I loved this movie, even though it's not horror. Horror movies are a dying breed. They are being replaced by gore/gross movies, that are not scary, they just make you sick. They are also being replaced by fantasy movies like this one. You can hardly be scared by this movie, but you can be fascinated. It is a nice mix of fantasy, action and special effects, so very popular these days. Usually I'm not a big special effects fan, in my opinion they mostly spoil movies, making them one big special effect with no room for a good plot that can unwind nicely (this is the case with Van Helsing, another movie starring Kate Beckinsale). In Underworld they fit nicely, the movie would probably work with less, but I have no great complaints about that and the plot works. Kate Beckinsale gives a great performance (she was probably really sick or something when they were shooting Van Helsing) It is a movie worth seeing in a movie theater. There is no point in writing about the plot, so in short it's vampires fighting werewolves. It's nicely done (possible SPOILER) and there is no absolute bad guy (end Spoiler). You know how in movies they can come pretty close to what a vampire looks like in your head, but they can never come close to what a werewolf should look like? Well here they almost make it. Almost for me, maybe they look exactly like you picture them in your mind's eye.I was fascinated by the movie even though at first they called it a Blade rip-off. In my opinion it's better than Blade (I'm very sorry if you're a Blade fan) and I kind of like Blade. The only thing that was similar was the way the story is ""told"". No vampires lurking in dark corners, preying on people, but vampires fighting one thing or another, no human vampire hunters with wooden sticks...you get the point.

359,Leiten,So many fangs I didn't know where to look.,9,1 May 2005,"Ah, vampires and werewolves (aka Lycans). Here we go yet again... Or so it would seem. This movie takes the general idea that randomly seems to hang in the air about these creatures and turns it into the closest thing to reality. The plot is fantastic and gives a great structure for the actual movie. Unfortunately, the script is not so hot. Although most of the time it builds suspense, sometimes it is charged with passion and at others provokes strong emotions from the audience, there are several occasions where it flags a little to say the least and you get a little distracted by something else, such as searching for the already half-empty vodka bottle. There are some lines and, (I hate to say it), mainly during Kate Beckinsale's monologues where you just think 'Get to the point already'. Otherwise, the movie keeps up a great, energetic pace most of the way through.Other than her monologues which leave much to be desired, Beckinsale's performance leaves you blown away and it perfectly complemented by Scott Speedman's. (Um.... Does anyone else think he has a weird kinda squeaky voice?) Sophia Myles was at her usual average standard and Shane Brolly was fantastic as the wonderfully evil, Selene-obsessed Kraven.I was however, disappointed at the ending which was, for want of a better word, to put it simply :lame. Really, really lame. I know that its practically the law that every single movie MUST have an ending that allows for a sequel but come on... A little originality please!

I was surprised that a movie like this could also be so smart. The action-scene were no ""Matrix"", but they held their own.Acting-wise, Kate Beckinsale was in-freakin-credible. She also looked amazing in tight black leather with peircing blue eyes. Bravo.

The rest of the cast is so-so, but since the three aforementioned characters give us most of the story it doesn't matter too much that Craven seems like he took a term of high school drama and then signed up for the movie.So if you appreciate dark brooding fantasy rent this movie or see if a friend has it, since it's certainly worth a few viewings.",Underworld

While all of the technical aspects of the film are kinda just alright (unless your really into the goth aesthetic there isn't much here) I was very surprised at how much effort went into the story itself. It was genius or anything but the lore was just fleshed out enough to be intriguing and a few twists really helped out the plot a lot.

There isn't a single compelling person, event, or idea in this movie. Not one.  It's almost baffling - it's marketed toward the gothy set, but contains no dark dialogue at all.  The firefights are listless - they're almost like filler between... nothing.  The acting is beyond awful - Carrot Top could have done a better job than almost anyone who appeared in this wreck.

Although they do wear leather trenchcoats and catsuits etc, which is a bit matrixy, the film itself is in fact quite original. They try to stick to a storyline but they also weave the action into it very well, creating a nice cinematic experience. The idea of modern day vampires, which although is not new, is very cool and it is in my opinion much better than the age old rubbish vampires that were killed by wooden sticks, and were scared of two pieces of wood stuck together in a cross shape.A very nice part of the film is the fact that kate beckinsale is in it, therefore making the film much better :D heehee...But seriously, I think this film is very good, bu for those of you expecting a bloodbath, you're going to be disappointed.",Underworld
372,roninmlb,Underworld: Underwhelming,4,29 September 2003,"Great idea, bad execution. I was hoping for an epic war between the two of the most famous Hollywood monsters, with a strong dose of Matrix inspired style. What I got was an anemic, pretentious, ""action"" flick that hasn't a spark of originality or life.The plot is pure action movie fodder, but provides us with only two weak action scenes; one at the beginning and one at the end; with a whole lot of boring material in between delivered by the least talented and least charismatic cast in recent memory. It fails to evoke any notions of an epic or ancient war. Worst of all is Underworld's vain pretentiousness. This is a silly vampire action movie and the filmmakers don't seem to know it, and they present it like it's freakin' high art.At least the action scenes were cool, right? Right? Wrong! Dead wrong (pun intended)! I'm really sad to see the once cool akimbo pistol style (using two pistols at once) made popular by John Woo's Hong Kong masterpieces, then brought to America in Face/Off and the Matrix,  go all mainstream. It's so cliché these days that you even see it used on crappy TV shows. If John Woo where dead, he'd be rolling over in his grave. And Underworld puts the last nail in the coffin on akimbo pistols, no intelligent action director could possibly be stupid enough to use them again, but rest assured, idiot, copycat, Hollywood scumbag directors like Michael Bay, have and will, and it does and will suck. Kate Bekinsale, while alluring as a vampire warrior, doesn't look too experienced or confident with the dual USP handguns she supposedly uses to dispatch so many lycan freaks.Worst of all, are the boring, and all too familiar camera angles used in the action scenes, taken straight out of the 1947 book ""Proper Camera Angles for Television and Film Action Scenes"". We've seen them a million times before. Only people who know nothing about action movies and only watch American crap would think the action scenes in Underworld are cool. The only scene that worked for me was the final sword blow by our heroine, only to have it ruined by the oldest gag in the gore book, the delayed dismemberment shot. Not only is it a Japanese film and animation staple, but was also used in another Matrix wannabe called Equilibrium only last year.

At 2hrs, 5 mins, it did drag on a bit.  Could have been a better product at just over 1 1/2 hrs.Action was pretty good, but lacking in places.  More story than action in fact.  Lots of characters but some went underdeveloped or were subject to 2nd-tier acting (Kraven).The vampires seemed too vulnerable.  Would Selene really have drowned?  Or died from a stab wound to the shoulder?  Please - she's a Death Dealer. The vamps seemed to get their booty kicked a bit too easily by the Wolves. Viktor went down too easy.  The other elder didn't seem to even be able to put up a fight.The plot was pretty good, though.  Definitely one of the better movies in this genre.  When was the last good movie with werewolves?  1980's?  Worth my 6 bucks on opening day...",Underworld
374,MadMonkInBlack,"Vampires, vampires everywhere, yet still the plot did shrink...",4,27 September 2003,"The major problem with the movie, amazingly {and upsettingly} enough, was the vampires.  Bear in mind that I mean no disrespect to Kate Beckinsale in this.  She was graceful, beautiful, and sexy from moment one.  Better still, she was intelligent, refined, and had a bit of the Renaissance-era sense of dignity and poise.  She combined this well with a sharp sense of slight ruthlessness along with the romantic-warrior-in-a-modern-world outlook and a certain sense of pensive sadness, which I did indeed like.  However, though she did quite well, even she could not make up for the utter lack of depth so prevalent in her vampiric comrades.An apt introduction to the first problem, I think.  The main, defining characteristic of vampirism -- that of drinking blood -- seems to have been utterly lost.  Yes, yes, yes, there were goblets of what could pass for blood and a blatant shot of a full blood bank bag; but what happened to the biting?  For the love of heaven, vampires BITE people â?` this is why they have those lovely, pointy teeth.  Again, yes, there was some vague mention of a rule or law not to bite humans, I believe, but that simply takes the fun out of everything, doesn't it?  Vampires are, beyond bestial, generally viewed as sensual creatures.  Even if that sensuality is perverse and lethal, the whole point of the vampire mythos is that there is a dread creature wandering the night, taking a twisted pleasure in the enjoyment of the flesh.  At their most hideous they still embody this love of flesh, be it the tragic lustfulness of Dracula or the more horrid sexual predations of others.  These vampires, on the other hand, seemed to be humans that had forgotten what immortality was all about, beyond the plotting and scheming amongst themselves, and slaying of werewolves.  Tsk, tsk.Which leads me to the next problem: there seemed to be a great deal of confusion about the exact nature of what separated the vampires from the werewolves.  With the obvious exception of werewolves turning into huge, snarling, feral, fur-covered chainsaws, the werewolves seemed to spend a great deal of time in conditions normally attributed to vampires.  They seemed oddly pale to a man, lived in dark, dank places, and worst yet they did not seem to have any connection with nature whatsoever.  In fact, the master ""Lycan"" {or Lykin, was it?} in fact, looked more vampiric at first sight than the first three to five non-Beckinsale vampires one saw.  Said master was, incidentally, also the first to actually BITE someone; and no, not in the hybrid lupine form; we're talking vampire-style human face and form with sharp fangs crunching into a victim's neck, here.  In fact, for a time, I was honestly somewhat curious as to whether these ""Lykin/Lycans"" were actually shape shifting vampires themselves, and THIS was what the war was about.  It took me a good third of the movie to be firmly convinced otherwise.Thirdly, while once again, Kate Beckinsale was quite fearsome, especially in those choreographies which involves some sort of jumping ~{interjection: whoever choreographed all of the mid-air or jumping moves should be applauded}~ many of the vampires, while able to spray a seemingly endless amount of firearm ammunition, apparently cannot fight effectively.  The predominance of long, drawn-out series' of hissing at opponents both lupine and vampiric was perhaps the worst indication, though the barroom-brawl-style swings were nearly as bad.  Nothing wrong with a classic vampiric hiss and baring of fangs; and in this ""World of Darkness""-esque movie, one expects the werewolves to have the upper hand in down and dirty combat.  However, there were several instances where the hissing just went on and on.  Related is the sequence of ten-to-fifteen-stroke display of whip agility mentioned in another review, which is excessive to the point of utter uselessness.  Honestly, were I confronted by a huge man changing into a much larger creature with teeth and claws, I wouldn't hiss at it repeatedly for ten seconds or twirl my whips to show the enemy how remarkably skillful I was.  Out of fear reaction, if nothing else, I'd lay into the bloody thing immediately and hope I didn't get trounced in the process.  There were others, but I think these examples say it well enough.To sum up, ""Underworld"" began in a ""Blade""-like fashion, which was all to the good.  It seemed to move into a somewhat ""Resident Evil"" sense of scene and tension, but with too little background story and too much reliance on gunplay for cardboard plot.  Finally, it settled {in all possible interpretations of the word} in the end to a ""John Carpenter's Vampires""-grade ending combat choreography for the last fifteen minutes. This is to say, ""Underworld"" was good, fast-paced, and visually catching at first, dragged a little as one began waiting for a bit more oomph, and slogged to a close leaving one disappointed.  It was the worse for the fact that there were occasional hints at what might consider the hoped-for vampire fare, which were never brought to completion.  The film was full to the brim of good concept and possibly wonderful plot potential that as a whole was brought into play about as successfully as a virgin owning and managing a strip club -- lots of energy, good ideas and good intentions, but not quite enough overall substance to make it worthwhile for the knowledgeable customer.It's saddening, actually.  I had rather hoped that, after the parade of utter low-grade drivel that was the theatrical attempt at ""Queen of the Damned,"" the next major vampire movie that hit the theatres would do us more proud.  Perhaps, if the implied sequel does come about in the future, a bit more consideration will be taken of past mistakes.",Underworld
375,ryu15g,Could have been better,3,2 February 2005,"I thought this movie could have had some better fights. Allow me to explain: If you see this movie, most of the fights involve guns, guns, and more guns. I was hoping that the vampires and the werewolves would go head on, and they do, only cutting to a blackout, with lots of yelling and chomping, in the background. The only head-on fight was the final fight. The rest were shoot-outs.The plot was different, but I think it could have been better. It was mainly searching for someone that might be related to werewolves.I honestly think that if the fights were a lot better, perhaps the movie could have been pretty good.So, all in all, the action made this rating a little low, for me.It's not bad of a movie, but I think it needs less guns, and more fists.",Underworld
376,possiblegod,Ignore...,7,3 November 2005,"Everything you've heard from the critics, everything you know about vampires and werewolves, everything that is standard in most fantasy/action films. Then you'll enjoy this film. I, unlike a lot of fans, will not claim that this is a move masterpiece, I will not claim that this will change movie making history. I, however, will go against the critics and say that this is a good film. Not getting a chance to see this in the cinema, when it came out on video I rented it out immediately. Now, at first, I could see what the critics meant it wasn't how the trailers depicted it and the script and acting in places was a bit rusty. I put it back and gave no more thought to it. However I soon found myself thinking about the film and the bits I'd enjoyed. I soon realised that this was good because it wasn't conventional and I couldn't stop thinking about it. There had been so many plot twists, so much to take in that I knew I had to see it a second time. This time I bought it, on DVD, and I found myself watching it again and again. This film gives you wonderful villains and just when you start to hate them something nastier comes along or they give you a motive which makes you confused. In one film the world which you are presented with at the beginning, Lycans (Werewolves) vrs. Vampires, is thrown into doubt. There are no longer good and evil, it is no longer this side versus this side and our hero Selene is stuck in the middle. The thing is every villain in this film seems to be fully justifiable in their actions yet completely nasty. I was trying, after falling in love with this film, to work out where it went wrong. I realised there was too much. You are thrown into this world and you have to keep up, there is no chance to sit down and work things out. That comes after seeing the film, this world explains itself through the characters actions. It is as if this world is real and we are meant to know about it already. Their is a history, their is a false history, their are legendary characters and not all of it is gone into in particular detail. Pieces of the world's history are just thrown in by the characters, as they would be in real life, with no long detailed explanation. That mixed with the cliff hanger ending, the promise of more characters from the past.

The leads all did a good job without truly shining.The script forced upon Bobbie Gee is problematic by modern standards and thank goodness times are changing.Cinematography and storyline were both fair to middling.Ultimately satisfying and entertaining, as modern vampires vs werewolf movies go it's little wonder this one hit the right buttons and was the start of a successful franchise.",Underworld

Oh, and pretend that there's no magic in the supernatural. They're as vacuous as you. They have their convenient gadgets to one-up the others' clique. How magical.Far from the mystical, mysterious cloak of legend, this movie reduces vampires and werewolves to the easy frivolity of rich versus poor.The ""mythology"" of either is simplified for film purpose. Snobby vampires who apparently shop at Hot Topic and drink the equivalent of bottled water - they live in a security-laden modern palace and get blood from (how lame) hospital blood banks.The wolves - well, you can't like them because they're not fashionable- (and the movie really doesn't care to develop them) - they have no appeal either (assuming we're supposed to like the spoiled-brat vampires, or the personality-free ""heroine"").Wow, that Kate Beckinsale sure can jump off buildings! Over and over again. And then some more.You really get a sense that someone liked ""the Matrix"" a bit too much, copied the style, pitched it, but no one (surprise) wanted to produce it.

380,pikabot,Ugh. A nightmare.,3,30 December 2005,"Underworld was bad. Terrible. Even if you ignore the clichéd dialogue, it was atrocious. The whole thing smacked of looking good on paper, but not translating to the screen. See: The werewolves doing their retarded wallrunning. I'm sure that seemed a good idea in someone's head, but it just looked silly. See: Selene escaping by shooting a hole in the floor. I'm sure that seemed cool when they stole it from Trigun, but when you think about it, you realize she could have gotten away much easier, faster and using fewer bullets just by SHOOTING the gorram werewolves. See: Big Blue Goku Immortal. Sounds nifty, but he just looked retarded. See: THe fact that Big Blue Goku Immortal, despite being supposedly the biggest badass around, goes down almost immediately, and common vampire Selene has to pick up the slack.Then there was the script. Oh, the script. Every single movie cliché in existence was used, from ""Time to Die"" to ""Leave us!""(Three times, I should point out!). In fact, I think this film's defining moment is when KravenSays ""Leave us!"", has everyone leave the room, slaps Selene and then walks out. What the heck was that? Nothing else about the movie encapsulated just how silly it was. It's either that or when they used the ridiculous bit with Victor's head sliding off. THank you for reviving yet ANOTHER horrible cliché. That's JUST what the industry needs.The action was mediocre at best, and since that's pretty much all this movie's got going for it, the whole thing was a cinematographic train wreck.I'm giving it three stars.

The setting was dark enough for there to be a sombre, threatening atmosphere, and although, like many films of the genre, the plot line was a little self-indulgent, Beckinsale carried the film with style.The supporting cast was also excellent, but Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie; her character's 'girl power' attitude and fondness for jumping off tall buildings in magnificent black stilettos satisfying many female viewers (the stilettos demand respect, even if the jumps are computer-generated), whilst her aesthetically pleasing figure permanently clad in black leather adds to the enjoyment of the male audience - if they weren't already satisfied with vampires, werewolves and guns.I would not recommend this to blood-sucking gore junkies, as there probably isn't enough horror to satisfy you, but if you're looking for a punchy, well-executed, enjoyable film and you don't shy away from small amounts of blood or horror then this may be for you.",Underworld

The gaps in the plot made the story very hard to follow in the early stages, but this may have been a decision made in the cutting room to keep the audience from realising that they'd seen it all before.

Not in story, but in style it does.In the Matrix and Underworld, the first half of the movie is a little confusing. As well in both movies, the second half explains what is needed, and then proceeds to take several interesting plot twists.I found this movie to be exceptionally good, the best movie so far in 2003.I am guessing Matrix 3 and Lord of The Rings 3 could be better, however, this is a very interesting movie that I am recommending to basically everyone I know.",Underworld

Considering that this was mainly an action movie, I must say that all of the action sequences were very well done. The fights were well choreographed and quite realistic. Also, the creature effects were great, and definitely not overdone like they were in Van Helsing. The special effects were top notch, and the movie crew got everything right. Normally, with a movie that has vampire's and werewolves, it is lame (and the whole story had been done before). With Underworld, the director put a new twist on all of the aspects of vampires vs. werewolves.

387,1024,"Great concept and atmosphere spoiled by too much ""product""",7,23 September 2003,"First off, let me say that Len Wiseman really did his homework forthis film. Bringing in the real life (and still living) Corvinus familyand several other historical incidents of vampires and werewolvesadded authority to the film. Wiseman was a set designer, and hisattention to detail and atmosphere shows up well. The weirdmonochrome blue cast reminds me of the best black and whitecinematography from the 30s and 40s. Let's face it; Kate Beckinsale leaping, jumping  floating andslithering around in a glossy black latex corset is no small reasonto see this film either. Maybe the most intriguing aspect of all is thenovel idea that Vamps and Lycans have a genetic mutation tothank for their immortality rather than a supernatural cause. I really tried to like this film. It IS above average (10,000 timesbetter that the God-Awful Dracula 2000) but not as exceptional as itcould've been. Wiseman seems to be trying to make a John Woohorror flick. There's just too much gunplay and too little script. Theyoung male leads prove that Hollywood is taking full advantage ofgender role reversal by hiring lots of male ""metrosexual"" actorswho know a lot about ""Hair Product"" and very little about how todeliver a line onscreen....the lead male Lycan is perhaps anexception. After the umpteenth gunfight, I started yawning. The final gun-freebattle gets better when Beckinsale joins the fight and at leastdelivers a stirring ending.  This is a B movie with an A budget,elevated to higher status by superior sets and Kate Beckinsale. Ithas some pretty novel ideas, and could possibly develop into areally good series if Wiseman can focus a bit & Beckinsalereturns. It's worth a look if you're into Vampire flicks.",Underworld

This movie is intended to appeal to teenaged boys, with Kate Beckinsale stalking dour-faced about in tight shiny black stuff (cameras in National Geographic documentaries don't close up so much on the hindquarters of their prey); and to teenaged goth girls, with the pale-faced loser vampires moping about like the world's on their shoulders. As has been mentioned before, this movie was released between Matrix instalments, and it shows, very painfully.The one saving grace in this movie is Bill Nighy, as Victor.

One being that a vampire, according to legend, has no reflection and also no heart beat; both of which were included in the film. Beyond that, I have only praise for it! The acting was also some of the most outstanding I've seen and I do not believe the film could have been casted better!

The costume design is stunning, as are the special effects. My favorite thing about the movie is the depth of the vampire and Lycan history. I also love the scenes involving Bill Nighy, who is an excellent actor. I would recommend this movie to vampire aficionados as a must buy, because it is simply excellent. My only one complaint, however, was the lack of martial arts action, which the movie threw out and instead focused on guns.

398,melaniejbaker2003,Someone shoot the production designer,5,3 October 2003,"Take a dark, gothic world, where vampires have been fighting werewolves (or lychens, as the movie insists on calling them) for hundreds of years and humans are merely bystanders caught in the cross-fire. Throw in the outrageously beautiful Kate Beckinsale dressed in skin-tight PVC, and the potential for spectacular special effects offered by werewolf transformation and vampire/werewolf battles, and surely you have a film that can't fail?Well, no. Director Wiseman is clearly a fan of genre/comic book movies, but has apparently seen too many of them, as his movie slavishly copies what he liked about these films, and never finds a style of its own. Stylistically it is a blend of The Matrix and Blade, with occasional hints of Batman, and this only serves to highlight the fact that Underworld is not as good as any of these films. (It even directly rips off many shots from The Matrix - check out the aerial shots of rainy streets and down a square stairwell, for example.) The plot is revealed far too slowly, and feels rather muddled, mainly because the minor characters are so one dimensional. It is difficult to tell the lychens from the vampires, let alone the minor vampires from each other.  The plot, such as it is, revolves around the lychens attempts to track down a human (Speedman), Michael Corvin, who carries in his blood some unspecified something which will allow the two races to blend, and the attempts of the vampires to stop him.Along the way Selene (Beckinsale), a vampire warrior dedicated to slaying lychens, and Michael, who has been bitten by a lychen, fall in love. How or why this happens is never made clear, as Beckinsale and Speedman have zero screen chemistry, and the characters never share a moment that leads you to believe that they have bonded emotionally, so it just feels that the only reason that Selene and Michael have a connection is because the plot requires that they should.A first glance would lead you to think that archetypal english rose Beckinsale would be miscast as a vampire warrior - and you'd be right. She looks the part (although she has inexplicably borrowed her outfit from Trinity in The Matrix), and she handles the guns ok, but she never changes her expression, and she delivers her lines in a manner that suggests she has just wandered in from a Merchant Ivory film being made next door. Shane Brolly's Kraven can't seem to decide which side of the Atlantic he comes from, as his accent is all over the place, and Speedman and Michael Sheen (as Lucien, the lychens' leader) might as well not have turned up for all the imapct they make. Bill Nighy's vampire leader Viktor is rather fun, but not enough to save the film. The fight scenes aren't cool enough, and the final battle is forgettable.A good idea, that needed 4 things to make a great film1. A production designer with the talent to give the film a distinctive look of its own.2. A director who knows how to do action scenes.3. A witty and coherent script.4. Cool werewolf morphing special effects.It has none of these. The end leaves the way open for a sequel, but only those who love Beckinsale in PVC will want to see it.",Underworld

In this last years,vampire and wolf-men movies have been a disappointment and each time they were getting worst. I didn't want to see Underworld but I saw it. I've never seen something so amazing and original. Kate Beckinsale it's a very promising actress as we can see in this movie. She is the best thing on the film.The scenes in which they fight and action parts was what most dislike as well as the way in which the vampires act. Underworld , in some way, remembers to ""Matrix"" in that ways in which they fight. As well we remember of ""Blade"" when seeing Underworld. Matrix + Blade=Underworld. This formula isn't good because although it does remember in some parts of the film to this two, it's very original and doesn't have anything to do with ""Matrix"" and ""Blade"".",Underworld

Kate did a good job with her part, I would have liked to see more build up of her character, they kinda left us hanging.  Effects were well done and yes the Hollywood is out of new ideas they have been for years, at least they try to spice things up with a new twist here and there.",Underworld

405,rudgerion,vampires vs. werewolves - nice idea but poorly put into action,6,5 October 2003,"Really, I couldn´t think of any appropriate synopsis, cause i don´t know where to start - taking the chance to sound blunt: this movie is one of the worst I´ve seen this year ! People must be blind, ignorant or their minds blurred by all the vampire series on TV that they give this movie a 6.4 - I´m honest, I gave it a ""3"" (nice try but ...) Most movies are judged within the first 10 mins. So the director thought: ""Well, I´ll put some guys into those black latex suits, give them some cool sunglasses (although it looks unbelievably close to matrix - never mind, nobody will notice and btw. black is cool!) and let them shoot around in the tunnels of a subway station. Hey that´s groovy !"" If u think this sounds ok, u should c the result ! Most of the scene I was trying to figure out if the director has seen this stuff or did he went to the toilet at that time ? Did he intend to test our endurance, how much bad stuff we can take without leaving ... I don´t know. Waving around the camera, wasting 10 mags of ammo within one minute doesn´t make a shooting scene cool - just ridiculous. Now u could say: ""Hey they are vampires ! What the heck do vampires wear but latex suits and black coats ?"" I don´t know - BUT THEY DON`T LOOK LIKE THE CAST OF MATRIX ! So this movie doesn´t only TRY to copy the style of other successful movies - it fails miserably. I understand that movie makers try to profit by ""matrix effects"" but here u can c why u shouldn´t try to place those effect by force - it entirely ruins your work. Basically it´s all I can say so far, without spoiling everything - hope U´ll take this warning seriously :)",Underworld

Just wait for BLADE 3.,2,1 October 2003,"To be fair, I'll start with complimenting well written story....the first time it was told a few years ago, but ripped off to make this boring and unconvincing tragedy of a film. Here we have Vampires without any real strength or power, fighting werewolves who seem to be almost immune to silver. Those who only want to judge this film compared to the average action/horror flick, don't bother. The only action we see are very wussy vampires shooting werewolves. SHOOTING. As if there is a shortage of movies that contain action solely featuring firearms. And DAMMIT, THEY'RE VAMPIRES. WHY ARE THEY SO WUSSY? DOES ANYONE AGREE WITH ME? I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of real action one would expect from a movie that has BOTH werewolves and vampires. There is only one fight shown in all of Underworld. Not a good one either. The rest of the fights consisted of confrontation, 2 fighters throwing down, a close up, then a cut to the end of the fight where only one character is shown as the victor. Since I do not feel this movie had much of anything to offer besides very mild entertainment, I give it a 3 out of 10. Please take my advice and avoid it.",Underworld

408,franseca,It's all about racism.. - Spoilers.,6,21 October 2003,"I thought it had pretty decent plot development, was dark enough without being too dark, and I liked the female lead. It was a little lacking in story details, though. Be advised I give away some of the storyline in this post, so if you haven't seen it skip the next two paragraphs.In the end, I gathered it to be not only ""Romeo & Juliet""-esque, but also to be a bit of an allegory for racism. The werewolves started out as slaves for the vampires, watching over them during the day and whatnot.  One slave fell in love with the slave master's daughter, and a child was conceived (and dubbed an ""abomination""). When said slave master, Viktor, was ""awakened"" from his slumber, he even seemed to talk with a bit of a southern accent. Anyway, slave was whipped, daughter & baby were killed in front of him, the slaves rebel and a war starts when the vampires start hunting them. And lynching them with silver bullets.And it turns out that they all had a common ancestor, and their condition was a mutated plague virus. So, they were the same, but different.
So yeah, allegory for racism. But maybe that's only my take on it. ;-)",Underworld
409,ash_0777,A dull ride,1,20 December 2004,"I have rarely seen a movie that had SO much potential, and seemed to ignore it almost on purpose. The premise is sound: a secret war is being fought between vampires and werewolves. a great premise, but unfortunately, the flaws hold it back from being either an action or a horror, and especially from it ever being a romance. The first flaw is noticeable all through the movie. Let me get this straight, these two creatures have been fighting for years, and years, yet humans have no idea. They shoot in subways, and hotels, and sewers, yet we have no idea. In Blade the humans who knew about vampires became Familiars. They worked along side them. Here, they just don't exist. Oh, except for speedman, he exists solely for the plot, to give it a bit of life. Sorry, nothing could give this bore-heap life. The other huge flaw, is the supposed romance between Speedman and Beckinsale. It has no merit. It just evolves without rhyme or reason. There's no connection or chemistry. The script calls for a love relationship between the two, so it seems like they just through it in. They kiss, they fight along side each other, but never have chemistry. It just goes through the usual motions. Most of the characters are generic and dull. They all seem to just exist on the most basic level. They simply go on pouting or scowling the whole movie. My favorite example of this is Kraven (Shane Brolly). He keeps one angry expression on his face the entire time. He looks about two seconds away from a temper tantrum. The last big gripe I have for this movie is simple and basic: Where oh where was the action through all this? I counted two and a half basic action scenes. I wish I could have slept through this boring mess, but my insomnia was acting up that day. My rating? 1 out of 10 My advice? If your in the mood for a GOOD action horror, stay away, go rent a Blade flick.",Underworld
410,tattooedmunky75,Bite me...,4,14 July 2005,"Being a fan of the horror genre, I was so looking forward to the release of this movie. If for no other reason, than to see Kate Beckinsale dressed in leather from head to toe (which, by the way, did NOT disappoint). Either my expectations were too high or the whole Vampire theme was just too played out, but I felt really let down by this movie. With all the flash-backs, flash-forwards and I think even a few flash-sideways, the plot boiled down to a regurgitated story about the battle between Vampires and Werewolves. The leading man would have been better off as a mute as he proves that just because you look like a rock-singer, it doesn't mean you should act. All in all, the movie reminded me of a Mariah Carey video, fun to watch but only as long as you have the TV on mute.

Aside from the abrupt opening right into the action, the movie was strong in what is was built to do, MOVE. It kept moving too, as they were on slow parts what-so-ever. The settings were awesome, the special effects were grand and the actors were on cue. The music was not my speed, so that was my only downfall.

414,uf36,Dark but hollow,5,23 April 2006,"Len Wiseman took the topic of vampires and werewolves into the neutral zone. Like a Japanese Manga artist he claims total ignorance of the Christian superstitions and history linked to it. That moves the film into the genre of pure action. It also helps that there is no real screenplay. Although the plot contains a nice turn where our our first impressions are betrayed, the story is quite simple. The acting is lousy but Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous in her tight leather suit. There is a lot of shooting and - later on - fighting. The movie would be a total loss if it weren't for the visuals. In fact, the whole picture is just a long video clip. Its the artistic use of special effects and the creation of dark, impressive images - although bordering on kitsch - which lift the movie just above the average of this genre.",Underworld

Unfortunately the reasonable, if somewhat repetitive use of action is mired in a script marked by clunky dialogue and a massive over-reliance on shaky,  blurred flashbacks to explain to the viewer exactly what is going on.The original premise; vampires and werewolves at war, will have been what interested many people in this film and I still think something good could be done with it.  Given the opening box office in the US and the apparent interest from the star maybe a sequel could live up to this film's promise. I'd just suggest the use of a more experienced writer to script as the roots of this film's problems are in the writing.In summary, while there are the makings of a good film here, this isn't it, although it's not awful.",Underworld

Well..thats how the story goes. Very interesting by my standards. You have a leather clad female Vampire aka Death Dealer played by Kate Beckinsale who fights and battles the lycans and is very good at what she does, take you to safety and then drop a bombshell on you. Selene,the beautiful vampiress, takes Michael(the rugged handsome human) and explains to him the whole vampires and lycans versus each other war and she tells him her past and reveals to him things about the current war. and as you go through the movie many many things are revealed. You find that Viktor is really responsible for the slaying of Selenes family, Michael is the carrier of the blood fusion they need, Michael becomes the hybrid, viktor tries to kill him but Selene interferes. the movie ends with Selene and Michael leaving the battle grounds and Selene must put her love life with Michael on hold until they can outrun their hunters.

417,gingerpete,An example of style over substance but certainly not a triumph.,5,18 October 2005,"As the sequel is just around the corner I decided to sit down and watch 'Underworld: Special Extended Edition' on DVD and then share my thoughts. Exactly what is so special about this edition is totally beyond me but it did give me an opportunity to address a couple more bugbears.Slow motion. Slow-mo in action movies has been around a long time and every now and again undergoes a fresh and novel revision by an inspired director. Peckinpah made it an important way of enhancing the emotional impact of violence. John Woo made it an art form which has since been much copied but was never bettered until technology allowed the Warchowski's to take it to wholly new lengths. In it's best incarnations it has been used as a way to enhance the on screen action and draw the audience into a more protracted and intense visual experience. Who can forget the death of Elias in 'Platoon', such an influential moment in cinema it was pretty much the blueprint for the death of Boromir and will be ripped off until Kingdom Come. Then we have the slow-mo in 'Underworld' which appears to be almost exclusively for the purpose of enhancing Kate Beckinsdale's coat (alongside preposterous WHOOSHING sounds). In fact what is it about long black coats in action films theses days? I remember after 'The Hitcher' raincoats were in for at least ten years before the realisation dawned that the novelty had worn off. We seem to be having the same phenomenon now, begun by 'The Matrix', but with PVC/leather instead. Or is it just a goth thing, after all whenever there's a big fight in 'Underworld' you can tell the vampires from the werewolves not by the shaggy fur and big ears (more on this later) but by their long coats! Next for the block is colour grading. All big budget movies these days are colour graded on computers, the process by which individual frames can be altered by having colours faded up or down in the image to create atmosphere or alter the look of a scene. When one colour is brought up above all others the image is said to be colour saturated. This seems to mean that whilst some film makers will use it to enhance their movie (much like the judicious use of slow-mo), others will decide that skilled cinematographers and lighting gaffers are no longer a necessity in their movie because they can just go and fix it all in post production. Enter 'Underworld'. Overblue. Way Overblue. With a bit of green sometimes. So what's it all about anyway, well I'm sure everyone knows so I'll keep it brief. Werewloves and Vampires are busily conducting their centuries long war when Selene (Kate Beckinsdale), in her stunning PVC cat-suit, stumbles across a Lycan (werewolf clan) plot to kidnap a certain Michael Corvin (Scott 'forgot what he looked like already and it only finished about thirty minutes ago' Speedman) for some bloodline experiments that their leader Lucian (Michael 'Why does an articulate skinny English bearded geek = mysterious to American audiences but = bland drama school type to me' Sheen) is conducting. Selene is a 'Death Dealer'! I groaned aloud when I heard that. It's her job to kill werewolves. Vampires tasked with killing werewolves are called the 'Death Dealers', not the 'Killer Krew' or the 'Ne'er Do Wellers' but the 'Death Dealers'. Dramatic eh? So in the line of duty as a 'Death Dealer' (I'm sorry but I think it's such a ridiculous name I can't stop typing it), killing werewolves in a generic eastern European setting, Selene inadvertently messes up Lucian's plan and Corvin escapes. Throw in some slo-mo coat action and it's all pretty humdrum so far but wait... A Lycan (all of whom up until now have been in human form shooting guns) metamorphosises quite smartly into wolfman form in a subway tunnel and faces down with a vamp, the vampire hisses, the wolf roars, this is it, this is why I watched this film, vampire versus werewolf in a melee, it's gonna be great, the metamorphosis looked cool, the wolf makeup isn't bad, I've seen a lot worse, they go at each other and... we cut away to a train! And therein lies the problem. It promises much but fails to deliver on just about every level. The characters are mostly bland and forgettable, rounded out by vampire boss Craven (Craven because he's a cowardly baddie you see... brilliant) and Selene's hotty competition in the vampire clan whose name I can't remember but she's English, blonde and posh so obviously evil. I said mostly because the one memorable character is Viktor, played in a totally off the wall fashion by the eccentric Bill Nighy (Phillip from 'Shaun Of The Dead' for you American cousins).None of these quibbles should really matter if the central tenet of the movie is exploited, ie vamps v werewolves but it isn't. The confrontations are just big generic gunfights between long coated vampires and short coated scruffy Lycans, in which the Lycans do spectacularly badly. They're like the horror movie version of imperial stormtroopers, completely incapable of hitting a barn door at ten dog paces. When you do see a full wolfman in action he huffs, he puffs, and that's about it, he certainly fails to blow the house down. It all eventually thunders, like an asthmatic sixty-two year old Stalingrad grandmother, to an underwhelming climax of bullets and sewers. I suppose the fact that it only took 134 minutes, and not 15 months, to get there is a small blessing.",Underworld
418,MorgaineS,Absolutely the best of its genre,10,8 March 2005,"I've watched this movie about 20 times now, and I've ordered a copy for myself because it's the best Goth-themed movie anyone has produced so far. (I have high hopes for the sequel.)*Slight Spoilers*The plot was ingenious. The idea of the Vampires having at one time enslaved the Lycans (werewolves) and later warring with them for centuries created an interesting dynamic. The look and the feel of the film was perfect - beautiful, spoiled, elitist vampires in lush dark environs; coarser, but more sympathetic Lycans (once you got to know them). Every part was well cast and well-acted.I was particularly impressed with Kate Beckinsale. I'd only ever seen her in a Jane Austen production, and you'd never know it was the same girl. Despite her petite frame, she played the part of warrior ferociously. She had a darker, more sullen approach to her character than is usually written for a woman in an action film. Scott Speedman is easy to love, of course, but I initially had my doubts about him in the role of Michael Corvin. Somehow, I never pictured him in an action role. I was pleasantly surprised that he can appear so fragile one moment and kick ass the next. The relationship between Michael and Selene will make or break the sequel. I can't wait.",Underworld
419,Makaroni,Nothing original.,4,19 September 2003,"I hoped this would be a really cool movie. It showed some potential. I kind of figured it wouldn't quite cut it though. It was entertaining enough to keep me awake for two hours but the plot is somewhat muddled and confusing. The movie spends most of it's time presenting stylish shots of vampires shooting werewolves and likewise. Things go boom a lot and there are some serious cliches, some guy's head gets sliced with a sword and then after he stands there for a few minutes the top of his head slides off. How many times have I seen THAT this year? The action sequences are also very confusing. The vampires and werewolves all wear similar drab grey clothing and combined with the drab grey filming and poor editing the end result is an insane jigsaw puzzle of who's killing who. Most of the time it is impossible to tell what's going on. There are huge editing/screenplay issues. Someone is credited as Michael's Girlfriend in the end credits. If you are paying close attention you will see that she is one of the bystanders killed during the first ultra stylish vampire vs werewolf action sequence. She must have been really special to him too, since he doesn't seem to care AT ALL that she's dead. He doesn't even mention her at anytime through the rest of the film.But to sum it up, what you've got here is a whole bunch of soap opera actors playing unconvincing vampires and werewolves and a fairly bland screenplay with a lot of shooting and cliche dialogue. It was very clear to me after watching this that the filmakers' intention was simply to cash in on the goth/vampire subculture and not actually to produce a good movie. Then they figured they would throw in some cool Matrix moves. Why not? Everyone else is doing it.",Underworld

The plot is worthless, simply a conflict between vampires and werewolfs (given a new, fancy name, but same thing), based on the usual stuff; a couple of lies and a tragic love story. Well, both sides are just convinced that the other species are goin' down, because, well, they don't really know, because it is forbidden for them to check up on past events! What a load of crap, reveals a really weak storywriter!! For me it looked like they tried to hide the weak storyline by having as little dialogue as possible, to make the story a little more mysterious, and many of the conversations is about 2-4 lines, attended by some really weak, not-very-convincing acting.

Some critics tore into the story, but I found the story to be WAY better than the first Blade movie. Some of the fight scenes were cool (the one with the whips, at least at first), but most were disappointing (too short, too much guns or fangs). The creature effects too, seemed a few years behind the times. (They also kept the creature effects budget low with lots of darkness.) I would have liked to have known more about Lucian and Kraven and their whole thing, and more flashbacks with Selene's story and Viktor would have helped give that more life, too. I thought Kate was great. However, it was tiring to see her in the same rubber suit scene after scene after scene. Now, for Scott Speedman, he was a surprise. I knew he looked familiar, but it wasn't until I was able to look him up that I realized, ""Holy crap, that's the guy from Felicity????!"" He looks SO much better with the long hair (he looks good with close-shaved hair as well), and he's bulked up a bit in this movie. Overall, quite the hottie.

This premise had a lot of potential, and when it focused on that potential, it was a good film. Unfortunately, the filmmakers too often tried to exploit obvious cultural trends in movies like ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade,"" and that's where they tripped up. This was especially true in the action scenes, where an obscene number of bullets were fired for no other plausible reason than because that's what they did in ""The Matrix."" There was also far too much black with blue filter, again seemingly because of ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade.""Unfortunately, discussing the ""good parts"" means discussing the original parts, which means discussing spoilers. To tread these waters without diving in: The movie relies on its own mythology for both werewolves and vampires. This might annoy some vampire purists, but I found it a fairly interesting and convincing mythology. Logic holes? Sure. What the heck, it's a movie, people. Nothin' but a show.There's social commentary in the movie, too. Vampires seem to be a recurrent metaphor for some social ill or other (usually bloodborne illnesses, as in Stoker). In ""Underworld,"" the social commentary makes for a more complicated plot than in ""Blade,"" one I wished they'd explored more, instead of spending so much film time on cliches.",Underworld

What is the deal with current movies making everything so DARK you can't see anything, and then adding a green or blue colored filter to remove whatever contrast is left. ( notice how vibrant the foyer of the mansion COULD BE..)THIS FORMAT IS STUPID... I DIDN'T PAY $X.XX TO LOOK AT A BLACK WALL WITH FUZZY INCOHERANT MONOTONE SHAPES MOVING AROUND. Little else can be said for the vamps.. Japaneese style overacting, sure, nifty sharp teeth, great, anything else.. no not really..  I have seen deeper plot and character development in my nephew's Little Golden Books.Yes, there are a few cool shots... (the jumping off stuff and landing into a walk, etc..) BUT, it hardly outweighs the lame... (A scene in a cop car where a guy starts to change into a WW, but doesn't,  OR THE FINAL BATTLE.... Looks like to unspectacular guys fist- fighting in a watery pit to me......)BRING EARPLUGS.. This movie has no problem in trying to trick you in to feeling a certain way by adding loud (and I mean LOUD, and annoying) sound effects and Music. They do this to try to mke you forget that what you are seeing on screen is just plain stupid. Adding a Thrash Metal Rock song at ear bleeding levels, hardly makes me more interested in the movie.. I hate that...Overall, I found that I disliked more of this movie than I liked it.. Glad I saw it for free, wait for the rental.",Underworld
427,G-Faust,I didn't know whether I was 'lycan' it or not...,5,24 September 2003,"I felt this film had it's ups and downs. At some points it was thoroughly engaging but at other times it just seemed drawn out. This film looks like it started with a good idea but the plot wasn't fully developed, which is a shame as it does have potential to be great. The fight scenes unfortunately follow the pattern of being tediously matrix-esque yet again but it is hard to avoid a good gun fight without the bullet time technique and the thousands of bullets being fired with approximately 1 or 2 hitting the target.Overall this film was reasonably entertaining. The plot at times seems a bit drawn out and Kate Beckinsdale is not a convincing action hero with her limp wrists and uncomfortable strides, but who can blame her in such a rediculously tight cat suit. 7/10",Underworld
428,tpcomputerman,What a waste of a good concept,3,20 September 2003,"You know what I hate?  When a movie that has a really good concept just totally sucks.  I went to see Underworld today, from the previews I thought it looked kind of cool, sort of a Matrix with Vampire and Werewolf's, not a bad combo I thought.  Although, personally I think that the Matrix, as great as it was, has ruined action movies.  I mean, how many times do we need to see a super slow motion shot with the camera spinning around in a 360 degree arc while the person is shooting a gun before we just go `ho hum.'  You know what I mean?  When it was done in the first Matrix it was cool as s***, when you see it on Charlie's Angles, well it's just gone too far! Oh, sorry, lost my train of thought there, I was talking about Underworld. The basic plot of Underworld is a war between the Vampires and the Werewolf's.  It stars Kate Beckinsaleas Trini. . . I mean Selene (I kept wanting to say `Dion?' every time they said her name.  For all those people out there to who want to write books and stuff, creating good character name is very important!)  who is a hunter of werewolf's.  During one of her hunts she notices that a pack of werewolfs are stalking a man named Michel, she saves his life but he gets away, from there she wants to know why they were after him and what she finds out will have dire effects on both her, the Vampires and the Werewolf's. That's the plot people, that's it.  There are times when simple plots done right can make a great movie.  I mean, the Matrix had a pretty simple plot but they did it so right that it made it an awesome movie.  This movie had a simple plot, a great concept, a good actress, and some good effects but did nothing with it.  It was just a loud, violent mess that made little sense.My major problem was with the story logic.  Trini. . . I mean Selene thinks that Kraven, her boss or something, is working with the wereworlf's for some reason.  But, you know, I don't know why she thought that.  All we saw was her trying to get to Michel while Kraven yelled at her not too.  How to you make the logical jump from Kraven not wanting her to save Michel to Kraven working for the Werewolf's?  I didn't see anything myself that would lead me to believe that Kraven was nothing more than an asshole Vampire.Also, Kraven, for some reason or another, is in love with Trini. . . damn, Selene (Dion?)  and I just don't know why. All she did to him throughout the entire movie was disobey him, run away from him, shoot him angry looks, punch him, and totally tell this guy that she hates his guts and will have nothing to do with her.  Now, I can see if they gave any hint that at one time they were lovers or something, but they didn't, in fact, from what I can tell, she has hated him for hundreds of years.  Geez dude, take a hint would you! So, later in the film Selene (Dion?) I guess fell in love with Michel the way she was giving him, you know, that look throughout the movie, how they sort of kissed at one point, oh and how she pretty much got excommunicated from the Vampire's because of him,  I guess she was in love with him. But, how?  Don't you need, oh, I don't know, some time together to fall in love? Or to maybe have some sort of common bond to fall in love?  Here it just seemed that they were in love because the scripted called for them to fall in love.  Really though, they could have come up with a better reason for her to be protecting him as much as she did besides the love story.  I don't know, it's like you need to have the two main characters fall in love or something, even if logic dictates that they shouldn't.  At least in the Matrix they had some downtime to make Trinity and Neo to fall in love, this movie was pretty much action from start to finish. Well, I always like to say something nice about a movie, so here it goes. The final fight was pretty cool!  Not a good reason to see the movie, but the last 10 minutes or so had some really good action between Vampire and Werewolf. What really bugs me is this movie had some really good ideas, the Vampire/Werewolf war, the reasons for the war, the whole part about the elders (there are three Elders, one awake, two asleep, at all times) and the secret of Michel were all very good ideas. But, a movie just can't run with some clever ideas, you need a well told story behind it, you need to know and care for the characters, you just need something this movie didn't do. I just hate it when a movie with good ideas doesn't follow through with those ideas and instead of a fantastic movie we have a run of the mill one that will be forgotten within a few months.",Underworld
429,rileyfreer,Good beginning but gets bad,6,31 January 2004,"Underworld has some style and action at the beginning, it starts out looking like something that might work but then gets bad.  You wait for a plot explanation and it doesn't come up, all of a sudden you get a few answers, ok....but then more stuff comes up that makes no sense, then you get an explanation of the entire plot....if only the guy had a better accent so you could actually hear it...from there mix in a little stupidity and very bad gun scenes at the end and you got yourself a movie that lost a few stars. I don't care how ""good"" the good guy is, you CANNOT take out a whole room full of men with automatic weapons with a pistol....it's not POSSIBLE.  It was a nice touch that there really weren't any ""good"" guys in the movie for a change.

430,tigerandpoo,A great idea gone very bad.,4,16 February 2004,"Underworld has a great premise with the conflict of Vampire and Werewolves fighting over domination but while it's a good premise, it needs a story to support it, and if you don't have a good story then you don't really have anything. The movie is more style than substance, and while style is good, it can also ruin a movie if you don't have anything to back it up. Kate Beckinsale and company do their best with what is giving but even their best efforts can't hide the fact that the story feels like it was written on the fly, and rush into production with out a good rewrite to help punch up the script. On top of that, the special effects are of not top quality, and you can see that in the way the Werewolves look and move. You really don't them at all, and when you do, it's very brief and mostly in the dark.
With better special effects, and a real story that made sense, this could have been the ultimate Action/ Horror movie but because they decided to cheap out on both the story and effects, we have this travesty.",Underworld

I'm a fan of movies so even when i'm disappointed in a film i still appreciate the efforts made to bring the movie out.Underworld to me was refreshing even if the effects were nice, the story classical, far fetched coincidenses and the plot predictable. In fact i've read several fantasy novels that were all about the same. it's just that a good entertaining movie was made about it with lots of noir (noir as in dark/black). Just like Brotherhood of the Wolf which was ignored by many people simply because it was french. Since i like long movies i was a bit disappointed with this movies length.

435,gerardowmby,A Great Spiritual Movie and Sequel,10,12 November 2006,"These two films measure up with the great epics like The Mahabharata, The Ramayana, or The Odyssey, where victims slay the demons released into the world. In defense of the violence in both Underworld I and II, even the ancient classic epics were filled with violence -- and for a good reason: Good must overcome evil. Then there are the heroes. Selene is only superficially a monster. As a child, she is victimized by Viktor. After his resurrection, she follows him, idolizes him, seeks his help, and after learning the truth, that he killed her parents and turned her into a vampire, kills him. Michael is also victimized when he is bitten, and though they are monsters, this victimization allows us to sympathize with them.Both Underworld and its sequel take place entirely at night, where the dark forces thrive. In the end, after the main characters kill the most powerful of the demons (both vampire and werewolf), the rising sun, the first light seen in either film, illuminates the world as the heroes celebrate their eternal life and love, and we are left to wonder how they will spend their eternity together. The Light has finally overcome the darkness. I am astonished that Underworld is Len Wiseman's directorial debut. To accomplish these two great works of art so young in life is a testament to his genius.Now for the bad news. The Extended Cut version ties for first place with Three Burials of Marquiades Estrada for worst DVD commentary of all time. The director and his lovely wife crack jokes and throw popcorn during the entire flick. The boredom is occasionally punctuated by Scott Speedman popping up with ""I did not!"", squealing like a girl. I learned nothing from it, and neither will you. Don't spend the extra money for the Extended Cut. Even the other features are not very good.Three Burials? The commentary is given by two Joneses and a Yoakum. The movie was C- and the DVD commentary was unbearable. Tommy Lee Jones, January Jones, and Dwight Yoakum sat in near silence during the entire movie and made inane comments now and then. One example: After another period of about five minutes of silence, I snapped out of my nap when January Jones popped up with, ""Tommy, wasn't that your barn?"" Tommy: ""Yeah, that was my barn."" Good to know! And Dwight, I love you, but stick with music.",Underworld
436,alichino,Trouble suspending disbelief,7,10 May 2004,"I love vampire movies and unfortunately for this flaw I will always rate said genre higher than Mr. Joe Public would care to.  In the case of this particular movie I found that I couldn't accept the ineptness of the immortals.  The werewolves at least had the cool ability to change shape, but the vampires seemed almost helpless, almost lethargic at times.  They seemed to level the playing field not with mystic power but with fully automatic weapons. Mayhap that was intentional, to show that the two species were almost identical.  I don't want to spoil the movie so I'll tread a delicate line when I say this:  the fight scene at the end was terrible...I would have greatly sacrificed the well light chamber for a dimly lit, blurry, high speed scene, more reminiscent of John Woo.That said, Kate B. does a good job of delivering her lines and even though you can't see her very well, looks stunning in that matrix style pleather jumpsuit.  The overall plot is some what predictable, but at least not worn out.As I said, I love vampire movies and I rated this 7.  If you like the genre, and can get over some of the more deeply fouled 'immortal' considerations then you'll like this movie.",Underworld
437,Arkwright99,Okay but not as good as Ultraviolet. (Contains Spoilers),6,3 June 2005,"Just watched the Extended DVD tonight... as a film Underworld was alright, I guess. I liked how my sympathies changed from the Vampires' POV (mainly because you're supposed to identify with Selene initially) to the Lycans' as the film progressed. Once it becomes clear that Lucian is trying to achieve a peace between the Bloods and the Lycans, his goals become more admirable. Even Kraven, from this perspective, seems more sympathetic - although he is an intrinsically craven coward (excuse the pun).On the minus side, everyone's inability to shoot straight really irked me. I mean, who trained these people? A stormtrooper? Also, there seemed to be no real world impact on this centuries-long war between Vampires and Werewolves; I was thinking as Kahn's men invaded the Lycan base: where's all this hardware coming from? How can you have a mass shoot-out in a public subway and nobody Official bats an eyelid? Everything just seemed completely divorced from 'everyday life', as though this was just a private war that didn't affect normal humans any. I mean, if you you saw some chick dressed in a tight, shiny, PVC catsuit and long PVC trench-coat would you just walk on by? In fact, the Vampires didn't seem that different from humans, except they have pointy teeth and can't go out in the day. Running water is supposed to harm Vampires, yet in UW rain doesn't affect them and Selene can survive driving her car into water. Also, I couldn't work out what the Vampires were supposed to be doing when they weren't trying to kill Lycans. What are their motivations? Just hang around looking bored and sexy? They appeared to have invented a synthetic blood stock, so they don't need to prey on humans - again another way in which the characters are 'divorced' from Real Life, it doesn't affect them and they don't affect it. Clearly there's some sort of group politics going on, mainly in the way there are two (three?) Vampire covens and the leaders (Viktor, Amelia, and Marcus) take it in turns - in accordance with the Covenant - to rule. But rule what exactly? It almost seemed like Vampires wanted power for power's sake, especially Kraven and Erika.At least Lucian and the Lycans had decently explained motivations imo, the need to create a half-Vampire, half-Lycan hybrid that would end the blood feud - something that he had tried through conception with Victor's daughter and when that failed though finding the untainted Corvinus virus. He seemed almost pleased when he saw that Selene and Michael were falling in love as it meant his dream would (possibly) outlive him.Watching the film I couldn't help comparing UW unfavourably with another modern updating of the Vampire legends, and for my money, the best modern-day depiction of Vampires remains the UK mini-series, 'ULTRAVIOLET'. (Check out: http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0169501 for details.) There the Vampires had much better motivations behind their actions, which made them more believable. Also, rather than resorting to 'dodgy science' with ultraviolet 'irradiated fluid' bullets, the humans in 'Ultraviolet' used carbon bullets, an echo of the wooden stake through the heart idea - and they were better shots too. :-) One of the things that makes Ultraviolet 'cooler' than Underworld is that it kept the whole 'Vampires don't cast reflections' thing, which UW junked, and also added electronic media to the mix, so Vampires don't show up on CCTV, photographs or electronic voice transmission, such as mobile phones. It doesn't have the Matrix-ish wirework and interminable gun battles that feature in Underworld, but it does have a first-rate storyline, terrific performances from the cast, a chilling score and is well worth checking out if you ever get the chance to grab the DVD.Underworld was good, but imo it could have been better. 6/10",Underworld
438,lapinPub,Plain and SImple -- It Rocks,8,19 September 2003,"I went to this film out of a liking for the ""Blade"" films and a desire to entertain myself with some black-leather eye-candy (AKA ""Beckinsale"") -- expecting VERY little.  With the starting graphics, annoying voice over and Kate Beckinsale's lack of grace as a vampire I was immediately concerned that I was in for a very poorly executed ""me too"" flick.  But by the time the initial 15 minutes got over with I found myself being pulled into a very captivating and beautiful world.  (In fact, the sound was off in the theater, making the dialog sound all hollow and distant, and I was so intrigued by the story I didn't want to go out to complain that I could hardly hear!) Not deep, but then again not nearly as pretentious as most other ""comic gothics"" lately, and that gives it a charm not at all present in other efforts, Clones, Matrices and Blades.

Starring Kate Beckinsale as Selene the vampire and Scott Speedman as Michael the Human. The back cover says. For centuries two races have evolved hidden deeply within human culture the aristocratic sophisticated vampires and the brutal feral lycans (wewewolves). I recommend that you see this film it goes on for quite a while but the action parts are brilliant.

I have no connections with either side and the back story is vague.The movie failed to lock my gaze. I found myself looking and interacting with other things while it was playing 1st run. I even let it play while I raided the fridge. Not much replay either, I've had it since it came out and i've only played it 2-3 times. By comparison: I have played the mummy and jp1,2&3 monthly.

442,DrivingOverMissDaisy,"Doesn't live up to it's potential, but it still howls and hisses",8,20 September 2003,"Vampires. Werewolves. Kate Beckinsale in tight black vinyl for boys. Scott Speedman without a shirt for girls. This is Underworld, a tale of warring creatures that culminates at present day. The bookends of the war involves a man and a woman from each species falling for eachother...which is forbidden. Selene, played by Kate, is part of a clan of Vampires that is central to the vampire side of the war. Lucian is the alpha male of werewolves on the other side who have some twists of their sleeves. Theoretically this is a genre fan's dream come true, but unfortunatly it doesn't live up to it's mind blowing potential. I'll start by telling you guys what is exceptionally good about it, then bring on my gripes.The setting of the film is a very dark, blue hue (the whole film is in blue tones) that serves well concerning that in many cultures, the color blue represents death, and Vampires are of the undead. The color palette was appropriate. The entire Vampire cast is exceptionally attractive, especially Selene and her blonde ""rival"". The costumes the vampires wear are elaboratly rich, but not obvious (aside from the black vinyl). They are of a higher society, which can be good or bad, but with the plot elements in this film, it's good. See, in mythology, werewolves were kept as servents for vampires, and Underworld helps elaborate a little more by vampires referring to them as ""daylight protectors"" while they sleep at night. These creatures are at war, but werewolves are still kept more so as bottom feeders, living under the streets in sewers in large packs. The werewolves, or ""lycans"", wear ratty and tattered clothing, lots of heavy jackets with hoods that can be easily discarded so they can transform without ruining anything. The lycans looks dirtier, grittier than the clean cut and porcilin skinned vampires. The differences are clear, for that part anyway.The acting is quite good. I didn't expect much from Speedman considering that he was a WB actor, but he did quite good amongst the more colorful cast. The man who plays Lucian is charismatic, considering his long hair, beard, and dark beedy eyes. Craven was a winer vampire, complaining too much because he is ""more beurocrat than a warrior"" to be a leader, and the actor pulls this off convincingly. The true elder of the Vampires, Victor is vicous, and deceptive. Most of his screentime, he had a lot of make up, and screw Ken Kirzinger, this guy can ""eye act."" The only flaw out of the actor's I'd have to say would be the large ""michael clark duncan"" replica. It's not that his performance is bad, it's his voice that sounded like it was straining too hard to be deep and imposing. I tried not to giggle when he carried conversations with Lucian. But when he got physical, and began yelling, he redeems himself.The pacing builds like any pace for a film should, which is move smoothly and gradually to a powerful climax. The climax is where all the action is. There are peaks and valleys in the pacing that feels comfortable. After one tense scene, appropiately there is a calm scene that comes after to let the audience simmer down.I do love the homage to the werewolf howl in An American Werewolf in London. It's still to this day the creepiest howl created, and they used it here in spades.Now my gripes:Where are the humans? Other than the opening 10 minutes, Scott Speedman's character, Michael, and his friend, there are not people running around town. There seems to be no traffic. I know it's everything takes place at night, but I have not seen any metropolis that sleeps at night. When there are werewolf raids going on in apartment complexes, how come the nieghbors don't complain, or even get curious? I know that a plotpoint in the film is that Vampires have begun cloning blood, so they don't have to prey on humans, but come on! Werewolves prey on them too!Vampires, other than Kate's character, seem to be very lazy creatures. Most of the film, most of the vampires are seen sitting in fancy eurotrash clothing drink what we can only assume is cloned blood. The soldier vampires seem to be afraid to step into combat with the werewolves, other than Selene, who does a fair share of booty stomping.Werewolves are seen too rarely. For once, I'm not bothered by the CGI shapeshifting. I was expecting bad rendering like in An American Werewolf in Paris, but instead we get was Hulk's transformations should have looked like. But, when there are werewolves on screen, you barely see them, there are too many quick cuts. But here's the worst part about the werewolves: their design. Their faces look great, but can they move their necks?Their necks and heads are so bulky and Hyena shaped that it makes the werwolves look like a highschool mascott. The lighting hides the limited mobilty of it's face, but it doesn't hide the fact that these aren't werewolves, but in fact were-hairless-hyenas. Seriously, these are suppose to be wereWOLVES, as in those hairy dog like creatures! I'm sick of these hairless werewolf designs. My roomate said a few months back that they don't have to have hair because they don't have to hide flaws in their FX. I looked at him like he was an idiot. In the past, they didn't design the werwolves with hair so they can hide flaws in their special FX, they put hair on them because they are WEREWOLVES! Argh. This was a setback for Dog Soldiers and Ginger Snaps as well.
I'd also like to know why there were not any female werewolves in the film. There was not one in any long shots of the werwolves in their dens. In every pack there is an alpha female and several (forgive the term) bitches. Just curious where they were in this whole thing.****tiny but unimportant spoiler*********Biggest flaw: Sunlight bullets? That was retarded. Period. The silver nitrate was cool, but that ultraviolet light bullets was just pretty stupid on the writer's behalf. But besides the sunlight bullets, there was too much gun fights over all.*****end tiny unimportant spoiler********If I was a werwolf, I'd much rather tear my enemies apart tooth and claw, than whipping out an oozy filled with sunlight bullets.Sheesh. There are times the werewolves drop their cloths and go at it, but the vampires still gunfight against them.
That's it for my gripes, which from what I said, isn't too much of a biggy, but enough to tarnish it from being a really great genre film. Don't expect too much horror, because there isn't any. This is strickly an action thriller that uses horror creatures. When I review, I try not to give much plot away, so if you find that I dont explain the plot in a straitforward manner, remember I intended it that way. I hate it when reviewers spoil things for you, even if they don't give away the surprise ending, but they'll say there is one which makes you try to think of what it is before it's there. I tried not to do that.

I watch it whenever it comes on TV because it is a movie you can enjoy over and over. Whether for Kate or the werewolf vs vampire battles, this is simply good stuff. The characters are believable, they behave in ways that we would in their situation, and the acting is good as well. If you do not enjoy this movie, it is because it is a genre that you do not enjoy. Period. Summary of the story is that you have a guy who is destined to become a werewolf (lychan is what they are called in the movie) and for some reason Kate's character takes a liking to him. She doesn't know if it's love or like, but she is fond of him and wants to protect him and find out the secrets that the werewolves are hiding. Sit back and enjoy.",Underworld

445,JulioBro,Juicy red...and tasty,10,19 September 2003,"This movie is, as we say in Puerto Rico, ""brutal""! (pronounced brootaal) It's simply one of the best movies made regarding transylvanian characters. Like in the Matrix, a combination of themes and stuff previously experienced in other movies is successfully combined, but with the unique European style.Most action movies from Europe tend to be very fast, not much development for characters and some slow motion; this is different. Like in Brotherhood of the Wolves, the inner feelings of the characters are more displayed and developed; their past an integral part of the story. The action is very stylish with exotic guns, exotic cars, high fashion in black, good special fx, and very detailed slo-mo takes; very, very nice.What makes Underworld truly different from the others, is what made The Matrix different, a detailed structured story with good foundation and motivation. This is not let's kill everyone because they're bad, there is a very specific and logical reason for what's happening, and the story makes you interested on it. The movie is not that much Matrix, it's more Shakespeare meets Blade. The drama is deep, controversy and intrigue is everywhere, and the twists are surprising, as they should be. This could only come from Europe, I just wish they would use more expensive film or higher resolution cameras, most of the movie is kind of grainy and we're already accustomed to the sharpness and solidness that 21st century movies should go for; but that's a minor glitch.As far as vampires and werewolves go, the movie is super. A deeper kind of creature story with attractive styling, but enough blood as to not let you forget...these are monsters of the night, they feed on humans.",Underworld
446,webhead54,It's about time!,9,22 September 2003,"I have watched a lot of vampire movies, and the sad thing is that most of them are pretty bad. There hasn't been a decent vampire movie since Blade (1998), and I am not of fan of mixing genre themes (i.e. vampires, werewolves, etc.), so I was skeptical about Underworld.However, I was very surprised and elated when Underworld far exceeded my expectations and turned out to be one of the best vampire movies to date. It integrates the werewolf theme in a sensible way with the war between the vampires and ""lycans"" as the main plot of the movie. The depiction of the vampires is very well done, and director Len Wiseman actually gets the vampire bite scene right. So many directors manage to mess up ""the bite"" making it look cheesy and fake--and this alone can ruin a vampire movie. Kudos to Wiseman for recognizing the importance of doing it right.I've noticed a few complaints about Underworld being a Matrix imitation, but I think anyone who says this doesn't understand film direction. Wiseman has done an excellent job of borrowing the best elements from the classics, such as, the gothic atmosphere of The Matrix and the bullet time effect that has since become the standard for fight sequences. Wiseman also pays homage to classics such as An American Werewolf in London (1981) and the vampire film tradition in general. And the movie is true to the literary folklore of the vampire and werewolf mythology.Finally, Kate Beckinsale as the vampire warrior Selene is TOTALLY HOT!!! She alone makes the movie worth seeing.Whether you are a fan of vampires, werewolves or both, I highly recommend this movie.",Underworld
447,yodergoaty,They took initiative and made the bad sequel FIRST!,5,22 September 2003,"I was already hesitant to see this movie, but the user rating here was just too high to pass it up. Unfortunately I didn't have time to read the reviews, as we had decided to go see it quite suddenly. The choice was betwixt this and Secondhand Lions. I wish we had seen the latter.
I know, I know... vampires can see in the dark, and sunlight is, um, ""unpleasant"" for them. And I know that werewolves can see in the dark as well. But, we are merely humans, and we CAN'T see in the dark! If there were any immortals in the audience I am sure they had no trouble, but I did. If I had been able to tell who was who in the initial sequences I might have been a bit more interested, but they lost me right there. Mood can be conveyed with good dialog and acting, not just with dim (dare I say DARK?) lighting and a blaring score which tried to force my attention upon a scene. I don't like being forced along by music... I like for it to accompany the action in a way that feels smooth. The music in this film seemed overly dramatic with its tolling bells and crashing crescendos. The little bit of rock music they used actually worked far better, in the two scenes in which they employed it. It seemed more fitting to the film than music which was so very serious.And you know what? There is only so much back-and-forth superfast gunplay I can stomach... it gets very redundant and I definitely have gotten my fill elsewhere. At least the werewolves took the initiative at times and kicked some proverbial arse the old-fashioned way. I was also pleased when a sword was FINALLY brought into play. It was about time, and could have been employed more.Also, if I had cared the least bit about any of the characters, I might have enjoyed it more. But I didn't, no matter how many times they showed Selene looking thoughtful and pensive and pained... even during her contrived-sounding speech which detailed the night she became a vampire. No offense to the actress (she has done some fine work), but she just does not seem ""Death Dealer"" material. Her seriousness bordered on being laughable, especially when she had to deliver some of those stiff lines. The only characters I was even interested in were Michael and the lycanthrope Lucien (Lucian?)... and only because I could identify with Michael because he was human (and confused as I was at being thrust headlong into the chaos of this war), and I knew there would be more to Lucien than met the eye. He was actually a fairly believable character. I was rooting for the werewolves, actually, the poor sewer-dwelling fellows. Talk about the short end o' the stick! But I was hoping they'd win only mildly... I found myself not caring in the end and just waiting, hoping, wishing, that this movie would end.
My husband fell asleep at the climax and when I woke him he replied he didn't care and would rather get the sleep than see the ending. Not a good sign, especially since he really enjoys role-playing games (which this seemed to be based upon). As do I. And we usually like the dark genera (we have Blade #1, The Crow #1, and The Matrix #1 on DVD), and I read horror and also specifically vampire novels. This movie felt as if they had just jumped ahead and made the bad sequel (like the sequels to the afore-mentioned films, which were all unpleasant).This movie was nothing special, and not worth our admission price and time. My husband mentioned that he had worked for one hour to earn the admission price, and then worked two hours to sit through it. He invested three hours then, plus driving time. This was something I might have watched on television if I was bored, but it was a poor choice to see in the theater. It felt as if I had just read a long but poorly penned book... a little cheated and wistful that I could have been doing something else, like taking a nap. Not that it was awful... it wasn't quite that bad. And many will surely love it, and good for them. The sad thing is that it could have been far better, given some good writing, better lighting (ANY lighting!), and a better delivery by the majority of actors. Too bad.",Underworld
448,aredo3604gif,Great ideas but too cheaply developed.. it looks B-style...,6,21 January 2004,"Before watching the movie on DVD I just bought I was thinking it was the live action of the anime BLOOD. Well, the story is great overall BUT the way the movie is developed is kinda lame, really. There are tons of missing points, they didn't portray characters deeply enough. The first Blade movie had some glitches due to budget constraints as well BUT it gave a generally better feeling to viewers, UNDERWORLD is missing the point here and there, it seems that the director and the production get lost in something bigger than themselves, something that they can't manage properly. CGI effects are not top-notch, they look cheap many times.. and I wonder why it always happens to movies co-produced between many countries, if it was a US only production I bet it would have been much better overall.A sequel would be cool but the director has to be changed, the whole production has to be switched over to someone that can do horror movies better. Sony did a great job with Resident Evil and they should put that production in charge of any possible Underworld sequel.Underworld would be a top-notch movie if properly developed and putting right people on the project might give sequels very high-ratings. This one it's just and average movie with a very good script that hasn't been correctly portrayed on screen, unfortunately.",Underworld

This movie about a age old war between vampires and werewolves is a amazing delight for fans of the undead. This movie combines the action of the matrix with the vampiridic world of movies such as Blade to make a must see movie for all. This movie could have used more martial arts fighting scenes but over all the story of a ""death dealer"" named selene that has to stop an act that could bring the vampire werewolf war to a bloody fervor is a nonstop action roller coaster with many twists and a few loops that will leave the viewer with a large amount of satisfaction and a innovative look at the world of those who walk the night.",Underworld
451,saruman2,More is not always better,5,28 September 2003,"Today, I went to see this movie, lured by its mix of romance and horror. Alas,despite its exciting sequences, including the opening shot, "" Underworld. "" is a movie which is unable to maintain its balance; there is never a explanation of why Selene wears leather or why Erika, Selene's rival, is not as aggressive as one might expect in a love triangle since their chieftain, Kraven, desires Selene more than her. Baskindale is pretty good as the vampire warrior Selene; like Catherine Anne-Moss(Matrix), she makes her performance the focus of the film. In fact, one of the most surprising things about this film is the "" mortality "" of the Vampires; they do not change into bats, hypnotize people or wear capes, the traits of vampire lore. Selene's black leather outfit, despite its seductive look, does enable her to blend in with the humans, track down Lycans, and find the human doctor who is linked to the eternal war between the two races of monsters. Overall, this movie is a good draw, but only if you are familar with the Hammer Dracula films. Otherwise, you just might want to come for Kate Baskindale, a very sexy and impressive actress.( Can't wait to see her in Van Halsing.)",Underworld

I had high hopes for this film, but as usual those hopes went up in smoke. For one, the action scenes were a joke, Ive seen better fight scenes in straight to video releases. The whole plot could have been great but instead they put together a cookie cutter story with some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. Was I the only one who found Kraven to be more of an idiot then anything resembling menacing? And to all those who think Kate Beckinsuck is so great maybe you can send her some fan mail and tell her to go away. Overall a very big BOMB!! Oh Yeah, Trinity would waste Selena!!!!!",Underworld

454,Timescrew,Underworld was sadly overrated.,6,10 January 2004,"Underworld. overrated. The movie inspired me as a gamer, filling my head with fantastic scenarios of werewolves vs. vampires. However, this `Romeo & Juliet' simile lacked a well-constructed storyline. The plot was interesting, but it just did not seem to flow with the events in a satisfactorily way.We begin with a brief introduction narrated by the protagonist, Selene (Beckinsale) a vampire `Death Dealer' charged with the task of hunting werewolves into extinction. The narration explains that this millennia long war between the two species has been raging on unbeknownst to the world of mortals, fueled by loathing and anger. On one particular hunt, she discovers that the werewolves are stalking one human, Mike Corvin (Speedman) in particular, but not to feed on him. Intrigued, she searched deeper and became involved in inner house politics and a personal turmoil between saving Corvin and dishonoring her clan. Later, Corvin is turned into a werewolf, forcing her to reevaluate her priorities between species, house, and heart. Nevertheless, she cannot turn her back on Corvin, because he holds the key to possibly ending the war and bringing about a new age for vampire and werewolf alike.For some reason, we are expected to view Selene as a `good guy' even though she is still a blood-sucking vampire, although she looks extremely hot, and I am a big fan of eye candy. Beckinsale shares a lofty position with Jolie's Lara Croft and Barrymore's Dylan Sanders in my list of `favorite-brunettes-in-tight-leather.' However, I could not sympathize with her character. I actually rooted for the werewolves throughout the whole movie. We see some good performances by some of them like Michael Sheen, my personal favorite in this movie, and a deliciously dark and intriguing performance by Bill Nighy as Viktor, the clan's reigning vampire awoken from hibernation by Selene. I must say, though, that Shane Brolly was not the right person for this role. Maybe it is the character, or maybe it was just him, either way, the movie was hurt by his performance, or lack thereof.The movie has several good points, ranging from stunning visual effects and props to having a dark quality to it like so many horror/adventure movies that are gracing our decade. As for bad points, I can reference the lack of storyline development again, but the biggest disappointment comes from the lack of character believability and development. They were either blank and mundane, or inexplicably passionate. Perhaps the prequel that is rumored to have been green lighted by Screen Gems will clear the air on this. I was also unimpressed with the lack of werewolf/vampire combat interaction. Obviously, we see that vampires do not stand a chance against werewolves in toe-to-toe melee, but just when the wolves descend on the bloodsuckers it cuts to another scene. I am sorry, but I am a huge fan of gore, and I would have loved to see a vampire be torn apart in rage.What I would really like to see though, is a Blade crossover. Imagine the greatest vampire hunter since Van Helsing teaming up with a vampire with a conscience (read: soul), a werewolf, and the provocative monster that this movie has (omitted for non-spoiler). It could be a real topper for the genre. Blade III: The Underworld.",Underworld
455,M-oO-dles,How to wreck the potential of a story like this..,5,5 April 2004,"When I first saw the trailer of Underworld I thought: that will be one to look forward to. Now, I've finally seen it and I must conclude this is a disaster of a movie. But then, the story is quit promising. I mean, you take a bunch of vampires and werewolves who have been fighting a war with each other for hundreds of years, and then the fun can begin, at least that's what I thought. On the contrary, the story turns out to be very boring and totally stereotyped. It was like I've seen the movie before. Every plot was so predictable and so cliché. Every time you hope they surprise you with an unexpected event that changes everything. But no, after half an hour you can turn the movie off, and think for yourself how it will end. Because at first you already know how it will end, and second it will be much more exciting because you're imagination will produce the story much better then the guys of the special-effects studio did. Such a shame, because the actors don't do such a bad job. In fact, they deliver a quit impressive performance. You can't really live in to a bad story, it requires talent to do so. The cast of Underworld showed me that a bad movie doesn't always mean bad acting. But what's really a shame is that the story of Underworld, what contains so much potential, is totally wrecked by the movie makers. I simply don't understand how the movie turned out to be so long. As a fantasy/horror/thriller/science-fiction/action lover it is hard to understand that Underworld even made it into the cinema's across the world. This film contains nothing new, no spectacular action, no impressive fights (and I would say you may expect that in a movie what goes about a war between werewolves and vampires), a lame an unimpressive story, and the special-effects are totally disappointing for a movie made anno 2003/2004.
Underworld is entertaining to watch, it is not that bad you desperately want to turn it off as soon as possible, but it could have been so much more. It just is to standard and too much off: Like we did not have seen that before! Even the good performance of the actors can't change that i rate this movie a 5, and that is particularly because of the acting.",Underworld
456,karl-booth,"Great visual treat, showing traditional film techniques at their best",8,19 February 2004,"Underworld is a film that unfairly draws comparisons with other films; the matrix, blade etc... In my view it harks back to the good old days of story telling, using CGI techniques only when completely necessary. It is very stylistic from the start, brooding, dark ... but not too dark, I can't be doing with films that make it so dark you can't see what's going on. The heroine (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire warrior, caught in a battle between the decadent world of the vampires and the rough and ready world of the werewolves. The stereotypes of the vampires and Lycans (werewolves) are a little galling and I'm sure neither would have any trouble identifying each other. The Lycans all look like Sabretooth in X-men and the Vamps, Lestat in Interview with a vampire.The plot is good and I feel directorially, for a debut, it was outstanding. Should I hear of any other films by Len Wiseman I would definitely watch them. Without giving too much away, the plot follows Selene, the heroine, and a human that holds the key to the futures of both Vampires and Lycans. It neither acknowledges nor discredits any other films that might be drawn into the genre, treading its own path in an entertaining enough way. It draws the viewer to make assumptions that will later be challenged as the well weighted plot unveils.Lucian (The leader of the Lycnas) plays the obligatory English baddie (Well Welsh actually) and does it very well. He oozes a charisma I wasn't expecting to find, and to be honest didn't find in any of the other cast members. Kate Beckinsale (Although absolutely stunning) doesn't make you believe she is a vampire warrior.The special effects are good. Traditional methods, such as wire working and makeup are done to great effect.

458,britamer_rk3,I wasn't expecting this...,8,8 May 2005,"I had never really watched Kate Beckinsale preform in movies, because I had stuck to the basic Angelina Jolie and Ben Affleck movies. So breaking out of my shell of movies was much more enlightening then anything else and I came out happy that I had seen the movie. My friend suggested it to me and I was hesitant because all the other vampire movies with werewolves had disappointed me. I was wrong on this one. I have to say, it will never be Oscar material but if you want a wild ride and non-stop action, this is your movie. Kate Beckinsale delivers a stunning performance as Selene, a beautiful but deadly vampire who inevitably falls in love with the handsome mortal-turning werewolf. She brings a individualistic style to the movie that portrays our leading lady can kick ass like any other guy. And her stunts are all her own. That was very good to see that she gained some recognition for doing her own stunts. Most actors wouldn't want to. With awesome visuals that blow a lot of vampire movies out of the water, acting with a wide variety of actors (I.E. Scott Speedman, Bill Nighy) it was good they all had something to go for. Each character was delivered and brought their own emotional conduct to the movie's set. I thought that was very cool.Over all I give it a *** out of ****",Underworld

Despite the plot that sounds incredibly stupid when you say it out loud to someone-""Oh yeah, it's a movie about vampire and werewolves locked in empire species survival and war""-it is presented with an incredible flair and elegance that is rare in neo-vampire lore.Beckinsdale is perfect as Selene, and if she had not been so good with the part, the movie would have gone from being another blood-filled vampire action flick to just down right painful to watch. Thank goodness for her acting skills.The hybrid werewolf-vampire, Speedman, was also a high for me in the film.

It's all very well covered.I do, however, have a plot question. Why does Craven (too descriptive a name?) make a deal with Lucian (turns out to be a romantic and idealistic werewolf) even if he becomes the all- powerful leader of the vampires when Lucian will be creating a hybrid werewolf/vampire creature (Michael Corwin) that will be more powerful than the vampires? And because vampires will try to kill him on sight, Michael Corwin will have to destroy them all?In the real world, Craven might have been better off killing Lucien when he was supposed to, assassinating the council (ok, he did do that) and then instead of awakening Viktor and Marcus with blood, maybe pouring milk (or whatever else they have an allergic reaction to) down their tubes. Voila, all hail Craven, king of the vampires! Maybe that would be too easy.That being said, I still enjoyed this movie a lot and would actively seek out the sequel.

Most annoyingly, outside of the terrible overacting of Shane Brolly as Craven (he espouses anger in EVERY look and in EVERY word he utters) and the stoic, zombie-like acting of Kate Beckinsale is the director's use of DOORS! Every damn scene of this movie either starts or ends (and sometimes both)with someone slamming open/closing a door, or gate. My guess is that doors must swing to and fro over 100 times in this movie.  This must have been the editor's first movie and asked the director to use the doors as cues for his cuts. Once I pointed this out to my friend, he couldn't stop laughing every time a door swung.The plot is pretty thin and close to being stupid. Plot spoiler follows: Why would the leader of the vampires and the werewolves want to create a mixed, super breed of half vampire, half wolf? The new super wolfpire would surely doom the vampires and werewolves to extinction. Secondly, we are continuously told that the vampires defeated the werewolves and pushed THEM to the edge of extinction.  Yet, except for the finale, every fight between vampires and werewolves is dominated by the werewolves.
So if you just want to have a good laugh and watch a stylish vampire flick, ""Underworld"" is for you.  But if your looking for a crafty, fast beat, well directed movie (e.i. ""Blade II""), it ain't this one.  You'll be bored to death and you'll learn to HATE DOORS!",Underworld

472,trnovice,Much to enjoy and I look forward to a sequel,10,29 September 2003,"Up front I should say that I really enjoyed this film. It had many flaws, some cinematographic, some heresies (if that can be the right word in the circumstances) visited on the traditional `lore' of vampires and werewolves and some very dodgy physics to boot (bullets filled with liquid light - hmm???), but I think it's worth remembering what movies are meant to be about, i.e. entertainment. This was very entertaining. Sometimes I when I go to the cinema I want thought-provoking, sometimes moving, sometimes intellectual stimulation, but sometimes also just fun. It's rare to get a single movie which combines all of these and I guess scoring well in three out of four categories tends to lead to a classic. Underworld was undeniably light on the first three, but made up for this by being heavy on the fourth. Yes, it was a bit silly sometimes, no it won't make my all-time movie top 20, but it was worth seeing and I'd watch it again.Criticism here (and elsewhere) seems to be focussed on the following: -1. The acting was wooden2. The plot was incomprehensible3. It was just a rip off of The Matrix / Blade / Insert random vampire movie here4. There was no regular vampire stuff - turning into bats, lack of reflection, crucifixes, wooden stakes etc.5. It was not very scary for a horror movie6. There was no sexual chemistry between the leadsHere's my take on these: -1. The acting was woodenMaybe it's just me, but when was the last time that that an action movie had oscar-winning acting as its main prerequisite? Write down a list of the great action films and a second list of the great actors - how many of the second appeared in the first (yes I know there will be some cross-over, but hopefully you get my point)? Personally, while the acting was not sensational, I didn't feel that it detracted too much from the overall experience. As for trashing the actors, I think that maybe the script was more to blame. It's difficult to make a silk purse out of a sows ear (I exaggerate somewhat here), but I thought that Ms Beckinsale did her best. I found her character credible and even moderately complex at times. Perhaps this sounds like a get out, but maybe vampires express emotion in different ways to humans. I found the slow development of these emotion in Selene interesting. Speedman was rather wooden, but then his character was meant to be rather carried along in the torrent around him and maybe a degree of stupefaction on his behalf was consistent with this (OK I'm probably being too kind). Brolly, Sheen and Nighy acted solidly enough for my tastes, allowing for the perhaps unavoidable hamming associated with the genre.2. The plot was incomprehensibleI have seen three professional critics say this - I can only assume that they must have been distracted by something during the film. I thought that everything hung together pretty well - loose ends were generally cleared up in the next scene, or the scene after. Not sure what was so difficult to follow.3. It was just a rip off of The Matrix / Blade / Insert random vampire movie hereWell it was about vampires and the protagonists did wear rather a lot of black leather and / or PVC, much of which was skin-tight. Aside from this, I don't think it was any more derivative than any of the films it was meant to be plagiarising. Because a film has some elements of some other work doesn't mean that it has no creative merit of its own. Humans have been around rather a long time and it would be pretty difficult to pick any wholly innovative film (or book, or painting) - I suspect in fact that such a thing has never existed. Seeing a woman in skin-tight black shiny garb and assuming that they must be Carrie-Anne Moss seems rather superficial to say the least. I thought that Underworld was a lot more interesting and innovative that The Matrix Reloaded if it comes to that.4. There was no regular vampire stuff - turning into bats, lack of reflection, crucifixes, wooden stakes etc.So it was a new take on the myth - keeping and accentuating bits and dropping others. Seems like a fresh approach to me. Not sure that vampires are some immutable part of our culture that are off-limits to all reinterpretation. To me, these modern vampires and werewolves were actually rather interesting - more superhuman than suprahuman, more like us than say Christopher Lee in a cloak and tuxedo. Perhaps the director didn't have the budget to suppress reflections, or didn't realise that vampires aren't meant to appear in mirrors. More likely he didn't think that this device would add very much or further the plot - I tend to agree with him. I think the mirror stuff comes from an age where mirrors themselves were see as either rather high-tech or even magical - maybe the lack of reflections in them characterises the humans of the time rather than those around today.5. It was not very scary for a horror movieNo it wasn't, but then I don't think it was meant to be a horror movie. Think of it as Aliens rather than Alien. The earlier film was a work of suspense and a great film (IMO). The sequel was more of a shoot-em-up with less of the interesting ideas of the first film and less of the suspense - it was a good film rather than a great one. In short Alien was (at least in part) a horror film, Aliens was an action film and so is Underworld.
6. There was no sexual chemistry between the leadsMaybe not - but I'm not sure that this was the main point. Rather I think the issue was more to do with Selene's dawning realisation that the world (and it's inhabitants) were not as she had always assumed them to be. Michael was only part of this - maybe even just a metaphor for it. Anyway I thought that there was enough sexual chemistry between Selene and the camera to make up for what might have been missing between Beckinsale and Speedman.Finally - judged as an action film, I thought Underworld it did an good job. It looked great (as did Ms Beckinsale), it hung together and the director didn't lift his foot from the pedal for very long at any point. The SFXs were good without being ends in themselves or distracting from the narrative. I enjoyed the mix of old and new with the vampires and werewolves and found Selene's torn loyalties and heightened emotional state central rather than a distraction. I thought that Selene herself was a credible, interesting, rather different and reasonably well-acted (script-allowing) creation, whom I hope to see more of in the rather telegraphed sequel.",Underworld

On the beginning we can tell who's ""good"" and who's ""bad"". But as the story develops we change our minds few times. Nothing is what it seems anymore. So, basically - two (or maybe even more in the second part of the ""Underworld""?) species learning to live next to each other on the same planet. Two different ""nations"" I would say. Does it ring a bell? Anyway - very good story, great soundtrack (both -instrumental and regular) and just dark, Gothic atmosphere.

475,groove75,A fresh new creative twist on the genre,10,20 September 2003,"I was pleasantly surprised by Underworld. It definitely has some parallel's to Matrix along with similarities with the classic vampire and werewolf movies, yet it incorporates a fresh new formula on the genre. I thoroughly enjoyed the depth and history to the story, and it goes to show that this is not a cookie cutter film. The style and cinematography is reminiscent of Matrix, yet the brooding ambience and dreary gothic locales reminded me of something out of The Crow or Bladerunner, yet it still retains enough original creativity to make it something new and fresh instead of a facsimile of other films. People looking for another ""Blade"" movie will be disappointed as this film has much more depth and complexity. I loved the movie, and have seen it twice over the weekend so far.

I had been reading about it from these sites earlier, so I really didn't expect much from the movie. You lot haven't been singing it's praises. Vampires kick some serious ass.

In light of all the attention devotes to the Twilight series, it's worth your time, if you're into the legends and the lore, to check out this particular movie. I'm not actually a self-proclaimed vampire movie fan, but this particular take on the old themes is very well constructed and tugs at the conscience in just the right way. All else is terrific.

I paid $19.50 for me and my girl to see this film and it was not at all disappointing.In fact, it rocked.  And hard!If you've seen a preview, then you already know the film looks good.  It is very stylish and heavy on the atmospherics.  There was a surprising and action packed story with characters one grows to like.  The creators do a very good job of conveying the realm these creatures dwell in and the war between the covens of vampyres and the dens of werewolves.You'll read a lot of reviews screaming ""derivative! derivative!"" and then mentioning names like the Matrix and Blade.  Don't believe the hype.  The Matrix by no means whatsoever originated leather clad badasses.  By the same token, Blade did not originate sword wielding immortals nor the nonmagical, nonmystic take on vampyres.  UNDERWORLD does a great job of respecting known vampyre/wolven lore and adds to it and paving the road to an intriguing future.  There's no doubt a second installment is forthcoming.  There must be, as it would be too great a waste of such a terrific setup.Bottom line is that UNDERWORLD does deliver on the action and never falls prey to cheese.  It follows its own rules and doesn't fall into the horrific trap of ""letting the hero/ine just because s/he is the hero/ine.""

The action was wonderful but mostly everything that we had all already seen in previous films the last couple of years. But to its advantage this movie was better than most of the genre. At least it knew what it wanted to be and do and done it. The characters were well thought out and the actor's portraying them done really well.But the problem I found was that the film was to long. Do we really need this much drama in all the in between times? By in between times, I mean the sometimes dragged out drama in between all the action scenes.

There are some great visulal moments like early on with a view of rain dripping off of Kate Beckinsale's supernaturally long fingers.  The problem is that it is not as visually powerful as BLADE or THE CROW although it is in the same genre.  If that is your cup of tea (or blood) see it.

Now, I was not a horror fan, in fact, I have always been quite intimidated by the blood, gore, and that kind of stuff in horror movies.. Well, this one is definitely a horror, but I wasn't the least bit scared through-out the entire, bloody thing.

It blew me away how well Kate Beckinsale, Michael Sheen, and all of them, in fact acted.. The only actor I lament being used, is Speedman. It's either him who's annoying, or his character. I think they could have cast Michael better, 'cause I see absolutely no way that anyone like Selene could ever fall in love with him.. And the romance is quite non-existant, I find.. All it is really, is Selene sort of kissing him, mainly to cuff him to that chair.And I absolutely love the setting, the long coats, and the double-pistol shoot-out with Selene... Totally awesome.

It was however quite funny in parts, for instance the dramatic music playing under such quotes as: ""Craven!"" ""What?"" ""Get me some coffee!"" ""Ok"" and when they descend to the library (for no reason) and start reading (for no reason), all accompanied by dramatic undertones. Basically the story failed to grip me and the acting was, in parts, horrendous.

It has a plot, unlike a lot of other recent movies, and the special effects are not overboard. Just enough to get the job done.

492,egirard-2,"Considerably better than expected, if you are familiar with the genre...",8,20 September 2003,"This is another perfect example of a film where generally the critics just don't get it. This was definitely made for a certain audience, probably familiar with a certain type of modern-Gothic vampire lore, and agreeably with elements taken from recent films and a certain unnamed role-playing system (shhh, don't want a lawsuit).Statement of Fact: Every film borrows elements from some other film. No one can deny that. Just because the elements borrowed are trends in other recent films, popular, profitable trends mind you, it's not wrong to borrow a few of them. It's because they are new, and fresh in our minds that people call them ""rip-offs"". To the people who say that the film is Blade-like and/or Matrix-like, yeah, sure, you'd have to be delusional not to see that. Of course, you should also be raising up arms about every war film that involved an in-plane cockpit scene, or every police drama where an officer was a corrupt puppet of some crime lord. Nothing new about borrowed visual and plot ideas, it's just O.K. in these circumstances because ""that's normal"", or maybe because the original film/stage play that first used that concept has been lost in time. For those of us who do like to see those derivative elements reappear in film again and again, we don't have any problem with it.Also, the movie does possess a sub-plot which is quite intricate, and not revealed to the viewer in one big easy to understand lump. For those of us who like to lose ourselves in the details of a movie, and not just in it's visual drama or catchy one-liners, and can bend ourselves into the world that is being presented to us, this movie is all about that. Many complaints about this film deal with the non-typical plot mechanism where you aren't really presented with stereotypical ""good-guys"" or ""bad-guys"" to become comfortable with and root for. Honestly, I think that was my favorite part of the story itself, and how it was slowly revealed itself to the viewer.Of course, many people are not interested in delving into a fantasy world as this, or familiar with the rules of the genre. Those people I can see are going to lose interest in watching the film, and be more aware of the films shortfalls, which there are a few (guns firing more bullets than it's clip would suggest. A somewhat overdone ending battle. And it's never daylight, yet the film eludes to more than one day going by. Thought we wouldn't notice I guess). I can understand their viewpoint, and I'm sorry you wasted your money.

Kate and Scott did a fabulous job. whole story and movie was so gripping that i dint take my eyes of the t.v. screen. and at last the end was so fantastic that i was very exited about the sequel part that is underworld evolution.so to end this comment i want to say that it is an excellent movie and everybody should see it. i salute the whole cast and crew of the film for such an exiting movie. thank you guys for the movie. you all did an excellent job.",Underworld
499,ghostwolf-todd,"The ""World of Darkenss"" Made Real",9,23 April 2008,"I understand why White Wolf sued. When I first saw Underworld, it blew me away. It was exactly how WoD should have been role-played, in my opinion: The protagonists questioning their motives, and not being able to put aside their still-human feelings about their actions. The styles were perfect, as well: The Vampires living in the artificially preserved past, concerned with style; the Lycans were animalistic thrill-seekers and berserkers. One has to wonder what Mage: The Ascension might look like.The additions I thought very nice were the internal politics and rivalries, and the power transfer between elders made very good sense; the conspiracy between Lucius and Kraven was brilliant. If the science was a little ""fuzzy,"" it didn't take much away from the experience.I can't wait to get my own copy of Evolution. I have to see what Markus does, considering his unwanted position.",Underworld
500,tweaky_bunny,"solid comic-genre movie, great casting and direction",10,10 January 2004,"I thought this movie was really great.  If it wasn't under the shadow of the continuing Matrix trilogy I think it would have done a lot better in the box office.  This was definitely more of a comic/graphic novel movie along the lines of the Crow than a horror/fantasy movie.  I can see how die-hard goths and horror folks would have problems with it, but I think the detail, acting, sets, etc. all make it a really solid movie.  Kate B. is a great heroine, strong and still feminine. More science-based than myth-based, I like the deal that vamps and lycans have viral blood diseases and aren't of magic/mystic origin.My only complaint is that the action is really gun-heavy.  I would have liked to see more of the natural talents of the vampires used (if any). Lycans seem really strong and go through a dramatic physical transformation, but aside from a few hints of enhanced strength, vampires seem only to have fangs and blue eyes when angry.",Underworld

503,RedDragonSyndicate,Modern epic of an Old Tale,9,19 September 2003,"Three words/phrases to sum up Underworld?  Modern, action-packed, and BEAUTIFUL actress! While Underworld started out not so different from other modern action films, I was immediately subdued into this world of Selene (Kate Beckinsdale).  At first, her sheer beauty in black captured my breath, but her character also plays a huge part in the film.  Whether it be a close up of her or an elaborate fighting scene, she shows an amazing performance in this movie, capturing the strong willed vampire that she is. The first half or so of the movie was simply various action scenes and scenes which set up the elaborate background of the vampire/werewolf war. Along the way, many twists and vague depictions are clearly confronted and efficiently carried out.  The movie overall did a great job of leading us to the end, the end where all the pieces fall into the ""final"" showdown. Underworld's interesting storyline definitely made up for any disappointments apparent in the modern aspect of the movie.  But then again, the modernity itself represents a major role in the movie and is often useful in appreciating the story. I'd say the final half hour or so alone is definitely worth the money, but all in all Underworld was no disappointment.  Plus Kate Beckinsdale is beautiful in black!",Underworld

There was one mistake in the movie and I don't know if anybody else caught it or not, the fact that in the movie the Vampires had a reflection, but we all know that Vampires don't have one, but other than that it was one hell of a movie, go and enjoy.",Underworld

506,AlissonNJ,Gritty & foreboding,7,23 September 2003,"I wanted to 'love' this movie - instead I 'liked' it a lot (I would have given 3.5 stars if possible).  Underworld tells a story of a war between vampires and werewolves that goes on for centuries.   Each side it trying to wipe out the other.  With assets such as the beautiful and deadly vampire warrior Selene and a powerful lineage of elders, the vampires have dominated. until now as the werewolves have a new plan found in Michael, the newly bitten werewolf and his unique bloodline.First the positives - Underworld has a decent story line with some compelling twists to keep it moving along.  It has an awesome look and feel that manages to maintain the gritty, foreboding feeling displayed in the trailer. The CG was for the most part not overdone.   The music is good and well matched.  Plus. they left it wide open to a sequel.The negatives - There was no strong actors to deliver the strength and power that this film needed.  While the story was well crafted, it lacked the details to make it very interesting.  The werewolf transformations (CG) took place in the dark in an obvious attempt to hide any flaws.While I was a little disappointed, I certainly recommend this movie and I have great hopes for the sequel!",Underworld
507,RaidaS,Original Vampire & Werewolf film,10,18 May 2004,"I loved Underworld. But I love most decent Vampire or Werewolf films, so that's a bit biased, eh? Basing the two species on a genetic, scientific idea makes them work exceedingly well, and removes all those problems that mysticism brings to a film, like reflections or holy items. This Vamp-Werewolf model make explanations easy, rather than requiring long prologues or in-depth discussions. The whole 'virus' idea is logical, and easy to follow. It's slick, modern, fast-paced action combined with classic, Gothic Vampire & Werewolf ideas, like the Vamp's high-tech weapons being kept in a massive, stately manor. I'm a real fan of the whole colour scheme, with few colours used in any one shot, and blues used for almost everything, keeping it looking cool, and sleek. I am also a Kate Beckinsale fan, and I love Action films that don't use women like an extra person to shout 'watch out!' or hit someone over the head. K.Beckinsale's character is great for this, it's someone who could easily be a guy. (Although, I'm thinking the outfit'd need a bit of enlarging if it were)",Underworld

510,blizardi,Save your 9 Bucks!!!,3,22 September 2003,"Save your 9 bucks or whatever the price of movies are now. It was the most unbearable piece of trash I have ever seen. The acting was terrible outside of Kate Beckinsale (who was gorgeous) and Kahn (played by Robbie Gee from Snatch). Kraven seemed as if he was the kid who was always picked last for kick ball, always whining. Sophia (the Vampire who is the jealous blond) seemed like she was the hot chick that only wanted to date the quarterback, but never got to. It was a pitiful display of characters. With the exception of Selene (Beckinsale) and Kahn (Gee) I couldn't put up with a single actor. However, I was impressed to notice that Bill Nighy from the movie Still Crazy has found some work as Viktor.The special effects were terrible; it was as if they used the same sequence of her feet hitting the ground at two different times in the movie. Which was quite obvious that she was on wires the way that she hit the ground. I'm almost positive that my school's film group could've done a better job given the time (and money). The computer generation was also terrible and easy to locate. They used slow motion where there shouldn't have been any, sped up the film when there wasn't a need for it, and cut any semblance of flashbacks they tried to show.They also couldn't decide whether the vampires adhered to the rules (that we all know and love) or not. We constantly saw reflections in mirrors, glass, etc. Inconsistencies in the strengths of vampires and the lycans (sucks to that, I'm calling them werewolves) was evident through out the film. One minute they had werewolves breaking through cement walls, the next they were being held by common chains. Bullets that couldn't break a chain one minute easily did the next. and when doors were locked, why would they have to shoot them open? Can't both of these species break wood fairly easily?Most of what I've been mention has been visual and/or minor inconsistencies that I would normally over look were it a good movie. Unfortunately, you need B to have A, hence I noticed everything stated above. The plot line was crap!! I had been reading reviews and comics about how it was the `the Romeo and Juliet for the monster-loving crowd'. If that was Romeo and Juliet, then I seriously missed something when we read that book in high school. I never knew that Juliet was a reject of the house... And had fangs.... And drank blood... either way, the love-line plot was extremely weak. The two characters were hardly ever in the same scene let alone the same room together. All in all, the love line was crap. The movie seemed to drag on an on. People were falling asleep. I couldn't believe how painful some of the scenes were. It was as if Len Wiseman (Director) was trying to lose his job making this movie. I do not fall asleep during movies, but with this one, I was right on the brink of slumber.The thing that surprised me the most were the people in the theater that liked the movie. As soon as the movie ended, I stood up and said to the friends I was with `I am so sorry I brought you guys to this. That was terrible!!'  People were looking at me like I was wierd or something. They thought it was a good movie. People laughed at parts of the movie where I couldn't see anything remotely funny. Normally I get the joke, but don't laugh cuz it's stupid, just like the audience. This time when people laughed I just didn't know what was going on.All in all, the movie was way too long. Too many long pauses, too many shots of people's faces and eyes that were completely unnecessary. too many long entrances for people we already know. It would have been a decent action movie were it about an hour shorter. it woulda been a better movie if it hadn't been so deadpan all the time. A good joke here or there would have been nice.So essentially, what I'm trying to say is don't go see Underworld, unless you aren't paying for it and have nothing better to do than torture yourselves for 2 solid hours of crap. Which is what my friends and I did. :)",Underworld
511,mrbigtimepimp,The most disappointing film I've seen this year,3,20 September 2003,"I was really looking forward to this film as I'm a horror fan who likes a more intellectual slant on the oft-ridiculed genre and I saw that Underworld held real potential to be a genre defining film.However I literally could not have been more disappointed as I left after the film. I was initially stunned to discover that this film lasted about 2 hours because to me it really felt more like 2.45 to 3 hours long. Basically I thought this film was seriously overlong, a problem which blighted most scenes.There were several story points and character developments that could have been totally explored in one scene that were stretched out to three or four. The story suffered from a lack of narrative, bad pacing and an attempt to stretch a fairly simple and thin plot out and overcomplicate it.I thought Kate Beckinsale was a strong leading lady and acquited herself very well and of course she looked absolutely fantastic, oozing the threat of violence simmering under the surface with real aristocratic class and measured poise and beauty. However the same could not be said of the other players.I thought most of the cast believed that if you hunch your shoulders, screw up your forehead and narrow your eyes then you become a menacing presence when I thought they just looked like they had read a particularly large phone bill. The 'Kraven' character was awful, the actor playing him like a one trick pony, see above for his acting technique and was it me or did he say his first line with an American accent before switching to Irish?It had too many models trying to break into acting sitting about in the vampire mansion, arching their backs and posing relentlessly as they tried to be noticed by the camera whilst the other actors could've faxed in their performances and no one would've noticed the difference.I thought Len Wiseman's direction was merely competant but as he had co-written the story I feel he maybe couldn't detach himself enough to seperate the wheat from the chaff storywise although he did use a small for Hollywood budget to good effect but this can't make up for the fundamental errors in this project and by the end of the film I didn't care about who would win the conflict as the goals of the different groups had been so poorly defined that it felt like five or six different factions fighting for no reason and no true resolution was defined instead leaving the merest shred for any potential sequels that I hope will never be made. An enormous waste of hype, time and money, absolutely underwhelming and awful.
SPOILER BELOW!
Lastly, when I actually saw how terrible the combined vampire/lycan looked, you can understand why they wanted to keep them apart!",Underworld
512,greenejam,"A bit lacking, but stylish and fun",9,27 September 2003,"Well, I was super-hyed for this movie, so I was glad it wasn't TOO much of a letdown... *cough cough* like ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico""... worst movie ever *cough cough*.Kate Beckinsale is the hot'n'sexy Deathdealer (although she looked better in Serendipity... unless you're into Goth chicks), Selene. Very stylish, very stylish.Not sure whether it was intended or not, but I honestly had no idea who was on which side in that first shootout until later on (minus Beckinsale being a Vampyre, of course). This kinda disappointed me as I like to know what the Hell is going on *cough cough* ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" fails again *cough cough*.So anyway, I liked Beckinsale. She does a good acting job. Scott Speedman was... eh... subpar, as you can pretty much always expect from a TV actor trying to make the leap into film these days. Their romance was TOTALLY underplayed (hey, much like Kevin Smith, I'm a sucker for chick flicks).In one comment, I saw a point brought up about Michael still not being able to beatdown Viktor after becoming the ""über-powerful"" hybrid Lycan-Vampyre, but this was because he did not obtain the blood of the Ancient Ones like Lucian had planned (thus why he had the current ruling Elder Vampyre, Amelia, drained of her blood on the train). Selene's blood was of MUCH weaker potency as she was not a purebred Vampyre.I found the part of the plot relating to the Vampyre Elders rather fascinating, so I which they would've developed it more. Viktor TOTALLY reminded me of Kain from ""The Legacy of Kain"" games. If you haven't played these games and have a game system that can play all of them (i.e. PS2), I highly recommend them. They're awesome.So, uhh, to summarize, I liked the movie a pretty good deal. It basically just needed at least one part (romance, history, etc.) of it to be developed upon more to give the movie more of a definitive stance on something. Without such, it just seemed a little weak in overall direction.Anyway... a fun flick. 8/10 for style and concept, albeit underdeveloped.",Underworld

They both had so much potential but ended up falling extremely short of being anything better than ""Well at least we got a good soundtrack from it.""First of all the acting was extremely bad, most of the theater burst out in laughter at how crappy it was.  Secondly the story wasn't written all that great.  If you try to have a real story line and try to develop characters thats great, but doing this while trying to fit in all the action that you think you possibly can just ruins everything.  I wanted to know more about the story, I honestly didnt think this movie would be more in the action genre than anything else.  Even the action wasnt even that great, infact it was extremely repetitive and made me think about how Matrix Reloaded sucked becuase it was nothing but overdone action.  And the guy getting sliced through the head was possibly one of the dumbest scenes I have seen in a movie ever.For this movie here is what you do, go get the soundtrack, and listen to it while you wait for the movie to come out as a rental.",Underworld
515,dreamangel99,Was a new twist on the paranormal...,9,20 September 2003,"First the down side to the movie....the overused Matrix special effects, but that always happens when new effects are introduced. All action movies lately seem to be taking a spin from it.The movie itself was excellently made. The story line was tight and the characters believable in a paranormal world. Too many people have compared this to the Blade series. This is unlike the Blade series in many ways. Can Blade take Selene? Well can Sylvester Stallone 'take' Bruce Willis? Who knows and who cares. These are characters in movies who have their own place, strengths, weaknesses, etc. in their own worlds. This movie was not about the violence and action itself but about the struggle for survival between two rival paranormal species. The Blade series was about an evolved vampire eradicating the world of vampires and the like.The existence and battle of the vampires and the lycanthropes is quite similar to the Laurel Hamilton ""Anita Blake"" series of books or even the survival aspect of the Christine Feehan ""Dark"" series about the Carpathians. I saw this movie about the survival of two species who became caught in a blood feud which neither side seems to have the full history on.I thought the plot twists at the end were very well done. This was not only an action movie but a story. It held up both the action and the fantasy aspect of its classification very well.I would like to have seen more character development on the lycanthrope side. I think the vampire side was heavily presented but the werewolves only seemed to focus on Lucian and Michael, who for all intents and purposes was not really a full lycan.All in all I thought this movie was very well done and lived up to its previews. I'd like to see more movies along this line by these same creators. Not necessarily saying a sequel would be in order but the story can be even more fleshed out as time progresses.",Underworld
516,senatorjones,Great Movie,10,21 September 2003,I was anxiously awaiting this film to come to the movie theater. I thought the director did a wonderful job presenting the movie without a lot of gore normally seen in these types of movies.

519,TonyD63,A movie you can really sink your teeth into!,6,27 September 2003,"Skin-tight PVC suits and long leather coats are back in fashion in this stylish, gory and action-packed vampire vs werewolf horror flick starring Kate Beckinsale, Bill Nighy and Scott Speedman.Perched upon the roof of a gothic-looking building in an unnamed city, Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire ""death dealer"" who hunts lycans (that's werewolves to you and me) in an age-old feud between the two species which has been raging for hundreds of years. The film moves quickly into top gear, and within minutes of being provided with this information from a rather helpful voiceover, the action immediately takes off in an extended sub-way shootout involving Beckinsale, werewolves and a hapless human called Michael in the form of Speedman.In between much muttering concerning covenants, covens and ""awakenings"", we slowly learn that Speedman is the descendant of some common ancestor between vampires and werewolves, and that his blood is the key to uniting the bloodline and ending the bitter feud between the two species. What follows is an endless series of gun battles and an orgy of mindless violence in some very dark places, as the two warring factions battle to gain control of Speedman and his precious blood. But as the body count begins to rise don't expect to see many wooden stakes and silver bullets in this modern day horror flick. We've moved on since the days of Hammer Horror stars Cushing and Lee, and bullets filled with liquid ultraviolet light and silver nitrate are conveniently provided by director Len Wiseman to dispatch the hordes of vampire and werewolf cannon fodder required for the many bloody action sequences. Well, it's more efficient or didn't you know that?What you probably did know, but which Wiseman forgot or just plain ignored, is that vampires cast no reflection, and yet there are several scenes where they clearly do so. Maybe it was a gaffe. Or maybe Wiseman just didn't care. Quite frankly you won't care either, as the near relentless action makes the 121 minute running time simply fly by, and is more than sufficient to compensate for this minor deviation from vampire lore, and the other obvious imperfections in the film.Plotwise, there's also a tepid, and entirely predictable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale, which seems strangely out of place amongst the unrelenting carnage and testosterone-charged atmosphere of the largely male supporting cast. However, given the uncharismatic performances of the two stars, mercifully this is not pursued. The non-stop action effectively puts paid to any real suspense, but there are sufficient twists and turns in the plot to maintain interest right up to the end, and the final good vs evil showdown between Speedman and the vampire leader, Viktor (Bill Nighy).Thankfully for a horror flick the special effects are well up to par, and the bone-crunching werewolf transformation sequences compare favourably to those seen in An American Werewolf in London. For added good measure we also get to see inside a body during the werewolf transformation - an interesting, yet revolting novelty, all the more so for the rather disgusting, stomach-churning noises which accompany this process.Beckinsale (perhaps best known for her work in Pearl Harbor) wears her skin-tight suit well enough, but on joining the ranks of the undead seems to have forgotten how to act, and gives a performance so wooden that you could make a dining table and chairs out of it and still have plenty of timber to spare. If she wants to make the Hollywood A list this is not the way to do it. Speedman is hugely disappointing and not at all convincing in a rather meaty role which gave him a great opportunity to really shine. He clearly lacks the screen presence to take the male lead, and on this performance seems destined to remain as a Hollywood also-ran for some time to come.On the plus side Shane Brolly hams it up nicely as the traitorous, vampire big-whig Kraven, while Beckinsale's former off-screen boyfriend Michael Sheen enthusiastically gives his all as Lucian, the wild-eyed, messianic leader of the werewolves. Nighy, looking like a shrivelled prune, rasps and wheezes his way through his lines but, given the weight of makeup he was obviously wearing, makes a decent job of playing the arch baddie in the film, and he clearly takes the acting honours from a largely undistinguished cast which has a strong Hollywood B list look and feel.Lacking the genuine horror in the vampire movie Near Dark, and with acting as wooden as it gets without sprouting roots, Underworld is nevertheless an entertaining horror flick and well worth a bag of popcorn and a bottle of your favourite fizzy to wash it down with. The teeth are nice, white and very sharp. The female vampires look pretty enough - just like Hollywood likes them, the action is unrelenting and gory, and the werewolf transformation sequences are far better than you might expect from a film with only a $20 million price tag. If this movie sounds like your kind of thing then there is even more good news - a satisfying climatic battle is followed by a closing sequence and narration from Beckinsale which strongly suggests a sequel is already on the drawing board. Silver nitrate suppliers everywhere must be rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of it.",Underworld

The colors reminded me more of ""Payback"" than any other movie. Too bad Underworld didn't have a storyline of any kind. Another boring Hollywood script over hyped. For those of you who have not seen this movie yet only go if you are a huge vampire and werewolf genre fan. Also, you really don't need to think during this movie either. So, for all of you who like this type of stuff, more power to you. Underworld did everything it could at the end to try and set up a sequel and unfortunately there will probably be one.

I quite liked it since its entertaining to see a movie once in a while with alot of action and not any long dialogues... I had no expectations that were any positive about this film, and thats the best thing, otherwise i would probably have hated it. But anyways, good entertainment is truly the one thing that matters!AND, the very best scene from the whole movie was when the 'Vampire-Elder' Viktor is back in business, and about to kick some serious ass at the werewolf-market! He enters with magnificence, taking with one hand grip of the wolf and puts it out of its misery...breathtaking! And watching Selena - admiring her at her best (in tight leather) really doesn't make the film any worse, and very good acting from her too! What i missed from Underworld was perhaps because the narrow vision focusing only Selena-Michael-Viktor, and everyone else seemed obsolete...very sad indeed! There will most likely be a second Underworld and there really seems too little to continue but really, see for yourselves!Rating: Some of the scenes were really good, and there appeared extremely good acting too, but the whole movie really was not that good!4/10 i'd say...",Underworld

Sure it's not your typical Vampires are bad guys, get your garlic, holy water, and sharpen your stakes type deal, this film is fresh, and unique. It is a refreshing new and unique look to the Vampire world. I recommend this film to anyone who is either a Vampyre or a Lycan (Werewolf) fan. The two sides duke it out battle after battle, and it has an original, and somewhat realistic origin of how Vampires and Werewolves came to be.The two best things about this movie, besides the action, is the Storyline, and the special effects, which are done traditionally, no fake looking CGI here.

People who you figure early on are dicks end up having a noble streak and the ones you think are good have skeletons in the closet and a serious chip on their shoulders. This made the movie consistently surprising (at least compared to the usual cut-and-dried action movies out there).The movie's been out for almost 10 years now but I only just saw it for the first time (I'm now dating a woman who is into the series and I want to watch the 4th movie with her soon so I'm catching up!)Definitely worth a watch if you like action movies with flawed, three-dimensional characters and no particular morality lesson.",Underworld

The plot was confusing for the most part, it prompted me more than once to say, ""OK, that's nice but why the hell does this matter""I am also disappointed by the serious lack of writing/directing/acting talent in this movie. The dialouge is not capturing or memorable, nothing stands out from this silly plotline flecking with gratuitous firefights. If making a good horror film is as simple as using a dark filter on your camera to mute the colors and dressing bad actors in black, this would be a hit.The lead actress did what she could with what was written for her, but there are failed attempts to establish depth in the character, these are writer's faults. However acting was not a talent requisite for ""Kraven"" or any of the ""Lycans."" The pathetic accents and horrid vocal patterns nearly made my ears bleed. I guess good directing is ""you, talk real loud and overdramatic"".All in all I disliked this movie, I wish there were more good Vampire films, but alas no one can fill the bill it seems",Underworld

535,Brad_Harmer,The Matrix Re-Vamped,7,11 May 2004,"Movie Review: UnderworldDirected By: Len WisemanWritten By: Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman and Danny McBrideStarring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill NighyAs soon as you have seen the first five minutes of Underworld, you realise that this is a film that owes The Matrix and Blade a huge debt.  While this should have been immediately obvious from the trailers and movie posters featuring Beckinsale in skin-tight PVC, twin pistols and a Trinity style haircut, it is also in the mise-en-scéne and execution of the cinematography.  All out gun battles are frequent, and all that is missing is the bullet-time.  This raises the question: why have vampires and werewolves fighting, and then have them firing guns at each other?
The fact that this is a fictional world (allegedly of its own devising, but I will come to that), is a plus in many ways, but it hits a trap that many fantasy/horror/sci-fi films fall into in.  The director and writers are obviously well at home with the world that they have created, but they rarely (if ever) take the time out to explain this world and its apparently complicated political situation to the audience.  This is a major flaw, and it is not until almost halfway through the movie that the audience has any idea what is actually going on.Apparently, the writer saw this movie as `Vampires and Werewolves do Romeo and Juliet'.  Let me state right now that this film bears little resemblance to the Shakespeare play, and that it is only the `Star-Crossed' lovers that remain.  A tarnished representation of one of the greatest love stories of our time, perhaps.  However, the romantic sideline seems crammed in somehow, as though the filmmakers realised that there needed to be some substance to pace out the next confusing gun-battle.  A major flaw of which is that the vampires and werewolves look virtually identical, so that it often hard to see who is shooting who.What is interesting is that the role-playing games company White Wolf Inc. attempted to sue the film for copyright infringement.  There certainly is a striking resemblance to Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The Apocalypse.  Don't worry, any knowledge you may have of the games' setting won't help you any, through the mysterious plotline.  That said, if they had just got the licence and made a Vampire: The Masquerade movie, the film would likely have been immeasurably superior.  That could have become/been a high class cult-movie.  Underworld, however, looks destined for the £5.99 rack.Overall, Underworld is a flawed, if enjoyable, action-romp.  Probably best enjoyed when in a no-brainer mood.  Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and the promise of her in a PVC suit is probably the major incentive for teenage boys to watch the film.  There are several nice action set-pieces throughout the film, but the overall effect is confusing and disjointed.
STORY: 6/10 DIRECTION: 4/10 PERFORMANCE: 4/10 OVERALL: 5/10RECOMMENDED TO: Teenage Goths, people who play White Wolf RPGs and drunken twenty-somethings bored in Blockbuster.DON'T WATCH WITH: Mum, Werewolves or hardcore White Wolf gamers.",Underworld
536,TRowley23,"Underworld, a movie with potential, but no direction",6,27 May 2004,"As I watched ""Underworld"" I found myself thinking that this movie had one of the greatest plots I could imagine. What could be better than a secret war between vampires and werewolves? The plot is perfect, but the movie did not do the best it could for the plot. It's completely unbelievable that humans would have no knowledge of a battle that has been going on for hundreds of years. Even though this is an action adventure movie, the element of believability still needs to be there in order to make viewers feel connected to the characters and the movie. In my opinion this is the type of movie that a sequel is absolutely necessary, and I hope the people in charge take advantage of this great plot to make a more believable story. If they are able to, ""Underworld"" may become one of the greatest movies in the past years.",Underworld

I really hope there is a sequel. I will be disappointed if there is not. This is an action packed story about Vampires versus Werewolves. But there is also an appropriate love story that still kept my wife interested as well. It was full of Matrix like excitement as well of Makeup special effects that I have not seen before. The concept originally Good versus Evil but the Vampires were deceived into thinking they were finishing a war started by the Lycans.But the Lycans did not start the war. They only want it finished. If you have not seen it it is well worth the rental and I recommend a purchase. You will not be disappointed.Jeff,Underworld

Kate is so hot, I love her in this movie! I can't wait till the other Underworld movies come out, I will go and see them. I really enjoy watching movies about vampires and this one just had a lot of action and love. When Michael becomes a vampire and werewolf he is totally hot and I would love to meet both him and Kate. Of course I don't think what Viktor did was right, he liked to Selene. The wolves didn't kill her family he did. And why would he kill his daughter just because she found someone that she really loved? Should it really matter if they are different, it should only matter on how they treat each other.",Underworld
539,ImperatorHazel,"It sucks. There's no other way to describe it, with or without pun.",1,18 January 2005,"The first thing people learn how to do in life is to suck. When a baby is born the mother then breast feeds it and it learns how to suck. The people who made this movie never mentally progressed beyond this stage because they still suck. This movie is not so much a movie as it is a test of endurance. You have to sit idly by while this movie destroys everything good and holy in this world.""Underworld"" is a horror/sci-fi/action/adventure/occult/Gothic/bad movie where an unexplained Romeo and Juliet type love takes place, although without the part where the audience cares. Apparently, there has been a blood feud between Vampires and Lycanthropes (spelled 'lycans', pronounced 'lichens') going on right under our noses. Selene, a piece of eye candy who hates lycans, is a death dealer who just can't keep her hands off two things; guns and Michael. Why exactly she can't keep her hands off the latter is not explained, but the former is because, of course, she also can't stop shooting Lycans. Kraven shows us he can't stop loving Selene but also that he can stop acting at will, if he even was to begin with. Viktor shows us that, wow, vampires drink human blood, and Lucien shows us that vampires can get pregnant, despite reproducing solely through biting.Before I witnessed this unholy sacrilege, I took the time to read the novelization. I, thinking this movie would be a wonderful portrayal of aristocratic vampire and carnal lycanthropes, wanted to know everything about the movie before it actually came out. Before I was thoroughly disappointed by the movie, I found the novelization to be very entertaining. The fact that the novelization was better than the actual movie moves us into my next two points; the poor acting and low-grade cinematography.""Willing suspension of disbelief"" is a term used by actors and directors meaning the audience will believe and go along with what is presented on stage. Movies follow the same rules, but ""Underwold"" decided to be new and different and suck totally. From start to finish, the actors fail to emote and deliver their lines in a believable and appropriate manner. I cringe simply thinking about how horribly this movie sucked. As for cinematography, it rivaled ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" on the meter of how badly-placed and incoherent the scene transitions were. Not only is the audience left bewildered and confused, by they quickly become disgusted as they are fed more mediocre and unemotive dialogue. If these movie makers simply wanted to see how badly they could suck in a two-excruciating-hour movie, they achieved their goal in the most obnoxious way possible.Visually, this movie is bearable. It would make any goth in makeup smile. The settings set the mood well, but the CG sucked. Of course, one could argue that this was due to lack of a budget (the acting proves as such. And did you see those dismembered limbs?) but give this thought a spin; George Romero, director of the Dead trilogy (""Night of The Living Dead"", ""Dawn of The Dead"", and ""Day of The Dead"") had little to no budget for his movies. The zombies had no torn-flesh, decomposing makeup (which ""Resident Evil"" proudly sports), but you could still tell they were zombies. Sucky budget should be compensated by a good dose of creativity. But no, Underworld decided to suck once again and make the CG not only choppy and far-between, but the werewolves (Or lycans, while they're trying to be different) looked like rampaging horse/panther demons from any movie containing the words ""Thing"", ""From"" and ""Beyond"" in the title.Sure, a horse/panther demon might be scary for a five-year-old boy with a complex, but that isn't the target audience, now is it? Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-lycanthrope. The vampires had their fair share of sucky creativity as well. Besides the frilly, synthetic-blood sucking, nancy-ass vampires who probably whined that they needed makeup to distract the audience from their terrible acting (also known as the main characters), most of the vampires looked like humans with those $5 fangs you find at a secondhand costume store glued to their incisors. Any vampire or lycanthrope purist would know that this movie is pure blasphemy. It defiles all of the traditional aspects of vampirism and lycanthropy that have been well-established throughout the years of horror movies. Vampires are evil beings. The thought of vampires realizing that mortals aren't just there for food sickens me to no end. And, somehow, lycanthropes are not as profoundly connected with the moon as everyone thought! Imagine that! Perhaps I'm nitpicking, but it is my belief that changes should be made for the better, not to further increase how much something sucks.The most excruciating part in this movie is when, at the end, they decide to further advance the sucky plot by setting up the possible thought of yet another Underworld movie. A part of me wants to see this simply to know how far these people will go to ruin their reputation entirely.In short, this movie sucked. There really is no other word that so best describes it. Bring your friends, bring your family. This movie sucked.",Underworld
540,hagridsfang,Not Very Good,4,17 November 2004,"Although this doesn't have a similar title, Underworld is another fight between two mythical characters - the lycan (werewolf) and the vampire. First of all, I don't know why the werewolves were referred to as the lycans throughout the whole movie. It is pronounced the same as a lichen, the plant-fungus species that lives on some trees. The story wasn't that great. Two mythical races locked in a duel for thousands of years, but this time, a little horror twist is added to it. The acting was not very good at all, by anybody. The werewolves looked pathetic. Another thing I could not stand was the slow-motion flying around junk they kept pulling. Please let the movie play by itself, don't take viewers out of the world you created by slowing everything down. Another grievance I had with his movie was that the characters aren't built up enough. I didn't care about any of them. So, not that good a movie in general. The violence they put in to appeal to action fans was really unnecessary. Sure, keep the shooting and such if you want. However, don't keep the witnessing of random pedestrians getting eaten and shot and torn apart. I'd rather not see that thank you. So, overall, not that good. If you like almost pointless and unnecessary violence and stupid flying through the air slow-motion junk, then watch this. Otherwise, pass it up.",Underworld

Underworld is actually a pretty solid movie with the exception of the Kraven character, which is poorly acted. The script is limited for some characters and takes a hit on that, but it's usually intentional. This movie also had an incredibly low budget and suffers from some lack of action and special effects. Those idiots that say it's action scenes are ""Matrix-like"" are about as far from the truth as it gets. There is NO bullet time and only two slightly slow-mo parts.

Kate Beckinsale was a fantastic choice for the lead role her performance alone makes the film worth watching, an amazing British actress with a huge amount of sex appeal. The special effects, stunts and fight scenes for this film were of a good standard. The only bad thing i have to say about underworld is that the lead male character could have been better however Katee Beckinsale and Bill Nighy more than makes up for his shortcomings.

The movie only has one thirty minute sequence in which there is little action every other fifteen to twenty minutes is an outstanding fight scene, the movie takes several corners and twists that just makes you keep wondering how this all happened. There is a biological twist to it that I rather enjoyed as opposed to the ""god"" look at it where vampires exist just cause they do. It tells the story of Selene the death dealer that we learn is still human in some sorts and tries to hang on to what she believes in as well as what she is told to believe in.

Part of the allure for many who enjoy Vampire/Werewolf films and books is not only the story, but how deep does the rabbit hole go? I appreciate Weisman's development of the back story as well as the current goings on in the film. It delivers just tastes of the proud but tragic histories of the cast and cleverly builds to the moment we all learn the truth and realize that whichever side we chose we will probably switch! Much like the Legacy of Kain video game series this Vampire tale is deep, rich and thought provoking. And although it does lack a solid cast, I walked away feeling like I got my money's worth and I can't wait to see Underworld Evolution. It will most likely be even better than this installment! Watch this movie!",Underworld
549,c.j.ward,I have been mugged at the movies!,1,24 September 2003,"I am stunned and horrified to read the comments on this movie.I can scarcely find words to describe how badly this movie stinks. I can only assume that many of the US reviewers were fooled by a bunch of English accents and dreary shots of a dismal Eastern-European city into thinking that this was somehow a classy piece of work.Beckinsale was a leather clad plank - I felt no sympathy or empathy for her character simply because her character did not exist - she was just speaking a few words.In fact this applies to damn near everyone else in this mess. There were virtually no character building moments at all - we just have no idea who these 2-dimensional S&M fetish-freaks are at all.There is no plot to speak of - all we need to know is laid out wholesale in the opening monotone monologue. If the director had not been so keen to slap his now-fiancee up on screen at every opportunity, he might have realised that there was a story to tell - that of the unwitting human caught in the middle of events he doesn't understand. Had we seen the story through his eyes we would have been shocked at the initial battle and surprised as the extent of the 'underworld' is revealed to us. Quite simply the director is telling the wrong story.Instead the movie treats the audience like bunch of slack-jawed morons and spoon feeds us the whole story up front just so we don't have to worry our pretty little heads with such nasty complicated stuff as plot.Okay. I love vampire movies. All of them Nosferatu, right through to Blade, and I'm pretty sure that in all of these pretty much the whole point is that vampires are like, *evil* and, you know, *drink blood*.Wearing a bit of leather bondage tat and moping around a big old house at night does not make you a vampire. Where was the blood-sucking? We barely even saw a set of fangs - these were simply the most boring vampires I've ever seen.The werewolves were a bit better, but the CGI was very poor and the man-to-sort of mutant pig-gorilla thing transformation is totally eclipsed by twenty year old classics like American Werewolf and The Howling.The less said about the noise which passes for a soundtrack the better. In fact I've said too much already. So I'll stop.I hated this film so much I can't even be bothered to rant about it any more.Go see this film if you want leave feeling like someone hit you over the head and stole your money - or just find a dark street and wait to be mugged for a similar, but possibly more entertaining experience.",Underworld
550,Yusaku Godai,"Look out, vampires have entered the Matrix!!",1,20 September 2003,"Underworld, more like Blunderworld.  This movie was awful. Trinity, I mean Lara Croft, I mean female Blade...er....whatever, reads her lines as if from a teleprompter, not that it makes much of a difference, the dialog is so hackneyed that you'll groan with every sentence.  The story sounded interesting when I first heard about it, but leave it up to Hollywood to just turn the whole thing into a Matrix rip-off.  The special effects mainly consisted of the main characters falling from great heights only to land on their feet.  This was done five or six times throughout the movie.  In my twenty-two years of movie watching this has been the first time I have ever come close to walking out on a movie in the theater.",Underworld

The fight scenes were terrific. The theme was a bit hard to follow, but all in all, the theme was awesome. Kraven's actions lead me to hate him as a character and Lucian's overall personality draws me more towards him. That is the reason that I'd prefer the lycans over the vampires. I like the whole idea of ultra-violet ammunition and the silver nitrate bullets developed for the movie. I'm sure that it was hard work coming up with those types of weaponry just for use in the movie. This movie was great, as is the sequel, and I must say that the only reason I rate it a 9 is because of the dark contrast and the repetitive music.",Underworld

This I don't believe, but as I said, a really nice action film. And of course, behållningen (what keeps it on top) is the wonderfully sexy Kate Beckinsale. The story is somewhat krystad (Swedish again). This means that sometimes, no matter how hard the actors try, the lines and story just isn't cool, or they are too pretentious. But that doesn't really matter when ms. Beckinsale fires of her automatic handguns =) This may not be an excellent movie, but since it features Kate Beckionsale, I have to give it a ten.",Underworld
554,crosseyeddragon,Boring,1,26 September 2006,"I've just watched this film and found it dull, boring and dreary and thats with vamires and werewolfs fighting each other! Seriously, if you were turned into a vampire or a werewolf would you really like to spend the rest of eternity with either side? Other then running around with guns in pvc bodysuits what else is there? Both sides are miserable and dull to watch. And wheres the werewolf pvc clad babe? Actually were are the werewolf babes pvc clad or otherwise? Both sides seem to lack the things that make them vampire or werewolf, like vampires reflecting in mirrors and passing out from loss of blood from stab wounds. Werewolfs however are able to run around like spiders on walls and ceilings and manage in werewolf form not to look like wolfs in the slightest. And being a werewolf wouldn't you try taking on the vamps in the daytime? In my opinion i'd say this film was just another three oclock in the morning last minute idea ""hey lets put vampires against werewolfs, we'll make lots of cash from this"" decision. As for the plot... oh wait was there one? Something to do with a medic bitten by a werewolf who catches the eye of a vampire who tries to help? que? i'm not going to watch it a second time to fully understand whats going on. In my opinion just a matrix wannabe. By the way Bill Nighy should of made a better vampire.",Underworld

558,faithslyr2,Underworld,5,25 September 2006,"I did not see this movie on its first release, but have just viewed it now. I found it an odd mix of semi-high tech and old legends. It was an interesting take on the vampire/werewolf tales, though. Beckinsdale was gorgeous and the use of light and shadow made it visually pleasing. It is a near absence of color. The rest of the cast could use some more acting lessons. Although mostly unknown to me, the mostly British cast seemed to give wooden performances at best. In my opinion, the gore factor is low, but youngsters still will need parental guidance to watch the film. As horror films go, this one is more on the eerie side. The two legends mesh well, though, on the whole.",Underworld
559,ganjalamma,No talent shoot-em-up.,1,10 November 2006,"Obviously no one in the editing department cares that handguns do not have unlimited ammunition. During the first scene, the female lead fires about 50 rounds out of a handgun before unloading. I love it how characters simply drop clips on the ground everywhere, and their guns when they are out of ammo. It's like automatic machine pistols are ten bucks at Mall-Wart or something, and not several thousand dollars as they are in *our* world. This movie was just an excuse to play shoot-em-up.People watching this movie might become confused who the ""bad guys"" really are. I actually wanted the protagonists to lose, because I simply had no sympathy for them. Vampires seemed bent to the point of lunacy in their quest for killing werewolves. Why? I like the werewolves. What did they ever do? The movie also introduces the hilarious concept of a new breed of vampire-werewolf mix. It reminds me of children's toys that blended concepts in order to boost sales; look, it's a gun-robot-dinosaur-spaceship! The script must have been written by someone in marketing, because it just relies too much on concept and flash, without much content. Everything in the film is either a gun battle, or an excuse to show off vampire fashion, (long leather overcoats.) This movie has nothing on the Blade series, which developed a much better ""culture"" for the vampires. The vampire culture in Underworld seemed like Zoolander, where models strut around with an, ""I know I look hot,"" attitude.This movie seems like a copy of Alien vs. Predator or some kind of mixed genre flick from the 50's. Swamp Men versus Mummies or Zombies versus Spider People might have done just fine instead.By the way, why is it that vampires seem to have tons of money and live in lavish castles all the time? Where do they get their cash? The poor werewolves seem to be incapable of balancing a check book. They have to live in a sewer tunnel.If you're thinking about renting this one, don't bother. The following movies have much more monster talent going on in them: Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Blade, any Lord of the Rings film, An American Werewolf in London, and even Jurassic Park.",Underworld
560,saighor,too serious?,7,20 September 2003,"I was really appealed by the movie trailer showing cool actions scenes, so I went to see Underworld at the opening day. Well to tell the truth I was a bit disappointed, may-be the movie is too dark and take itself too seriously. In opposite of Blade II which had some kind of funny one-liners.The story have some nice twists, twists that make you wonder who are the good and bad guys, that's great, unfortunately they are conducted by a quite bad dialog.Pros: very good story twists, nice sceneries & costumes, cool but not impressive action scenes.Cons: bad dialog, dark monochromatic oppressive ambiance, too damn serious, cheap romance.I will give a generous 7/10",Underworld

Let's just say that in the packed theatre I was in, the audience was enraptured for the entire length of the film.The vampires were represented well, particularly Selene (Beckinsale) in her death dealer outfit.  Whatever the designer was going for, she came up with a costume that looked good, but at the same time looked absolutely functional for Selene's particular line of work (Killing Lycans.)
Character development could have been a little stronger, but was still good, considering how many secondary characters were used besides Speedman and Beckinsale.I give this movie 10/10.",Underworld

The word I would have to use is surprised.Underworld is fun, intriguing and catches you with all of the side characters involved. Kate Beckinsale may get top billing but it is the rest of the cast who carries the film from beginning to end. The movie boasts a great number of well thought out characters, giving it more depth than you average Vampire Hunter/Killer movies.There is enough action, back story and suspense to keep you guessing. Is it the best movie you will ever see? No, but you won't be mad after watching.",Underworld

The dialogue is predictable and trite and the action sequences are boring.The film should be enjoyable as a no-brainer action flick but it fails miserably. The costumes and setting are atmospheric, but again and again the action sequences let it down. I don't know why, but the action all feels flat and uninspired. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, and it doesn't live up to its own slick and modern appearance. It's not only vaguely unsatisfying but also boring, which is a terrible crime for an action movie, they're supposed to be all-excitement adrenaline fests.As a film, Underworld is a corpse wrapped in a shiny leather suit.",Underworld
566,csumen,great concept- see the trailer instead,10,20 September 2003,"Not bad for a female Blade movie. plot is not as light as it appears and has some interesting premises (eg. the fighting cousins concept, slaves vs masters). Lotsa guns, action sequences well done but few in number (hence the trailer is the best part about it) and the movie has an overachieving low budget feel (a la Equilibrium) rather than the cinematic opulance of Matrix for example. Beckinsale combines fragility with a lethal attitute, not a bad action heroine start. The love interest guy was very dull, didn't portray an MD type convincingly, and Kraven was a whining muskrat of a vampire, so much so that I was laughing at all his line deliveries by the end. The vampires were very effete creatures and it was a wonder how they could ever lord it over their lower class brethren, especially with the day disadvantage (the only classical vampire weakness brought up in the movie). Overall, the movie is pretty cool and as flashy as the fake silvery 'silver nitrate' the vampires used...don't know if it's cool enough to be pre-wired for a sequel though.",Underworld
567,TheLastDuchess,Decent,10,4 April 2004,"Although the movie may not have inspired people around the world to jump for joy at this dark and oftimes sensual supernatural film, the movie itself wasn't as bad as most people seem to think. If you're considering watching the movie because you're a Blade/Lost Boys/Craft fan, then go ahead and skip this one; as much as I love those movies, the action scenes and humor in Underworld aren't enough to make this movie worthwhile for you. However, if you're interested in visually pleasing filmography and a storyline that actually requires you to think a bit to follow along, this movie is a good one. Not everyone is going to like this movie. As a supernatural enthusiast, I loved it but that doesn't mean it is for everyone. I look forward to the sequel, coming soon!",Underworld
568,dragonfishusa,Wesley Snipes watch your back...,7,8 May 2004,"A fun popcorn movie, by keeping your expectations in perspective, you can look forward to the sequel and purported prequel. The story line has great potential but the director seems content to revisit action sequences seen in the matrix, highlander, and blade, etc.  Kate Beckinsale's Selene gives Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity a run for her money in the black latex department and essentially saves the movie despite its somewhat abrupt ending. Great foley effects keep you in the middle of the action and the the blue grey tones maintain the 'underworld' environment that the characters thrive on.  A good rental and a nice way to spend a rainy weekend.",Underworld
569,thesaurus,Not a good movie.,2,28 September 2003,"This movie is, unfortunately, one of the worst I have ever seen. The plot is terrible, confusing (at times), and the fight scenes all have a massive sense of deja-vu to them. There are so many instances where characters completely changed their personalities that I almost walked out of the theatre. It's too gothic, too dark, and for a movie so highly promoted it lacks a LOT in quality. The acting was stiff, laughable, and rehearsed (and NEVER believable), and overall the movie was, well, stupid, at best.",Underworld
570,byteRanger,Lives up to hype,9,28 September 2003,"Believable.  Go into this film with an open mind and you'll enjoy every minute of it.  Is it the greatest movie of all time?  No.  Is it one of the best vampire movies ever put to the screen?  I say ""Yes!"".
What makes this film refreshing is the perspective of the story.  You may not realize while watching, but there is very little ""human"" involvement in the story.  Because of this, the characters involved become more ""human"" and their story becomes more believable.Particularly believable is the embedded explanation of how vampires and werewolfs came to exist.  Backing the modern era conflict with those historical facts is important to the plot; it is the foundation on which the story is built.Another huge aspect of the film that leads to believability is that the characters are free to express emotions.  Vampires that cry, werewolfs that grieve -- anger, vengence, love, integrity, all contribute to making the ""monsters"" more ""human"".C'mon, to say Kate Beckinsale is ""hot"" in this film is an insult.  Kate is absolutely sizzling!  The role of Selene is so contradictory to anything that Kate has done thus far.  The fact that this was not a stereotypical role for her, made Selene a flawless character.Twists in the storyline will keep you intellectually challenged. What you believe at the start, you will challenge yourself to believe midway through -- your attachment to the character Lucian will prove this to be true.
Don't get hung up on spoilers.  So vampires aren't supposed to be able to cast a reflection. Says who? Humans?  Well humans didn't know there was an unground battle raging between to non-existent species for centuries.  The casting of a reflection (Selene in the mirror) is important to the story. For you hardcore vampire enthusiasts, let the story challenge your beliefs and accept that perhaps things are not as you have come to believe.
Let it go and enjoy the film for what it is -- a high impact, action filled, Romeo and Juliet-ish, Matrix-like, portrayal of humanity from a non-human perspective.",Underworld
571,rllessing,Excellent movie,8,11 January 2004,"I love this movie. Any time a movie can take a traditional genre or sub-genre and put a new spin on it without falling into the same old cliches of movies past definitely gets the nod from me.It seems that so many vampire and werewolf movies for the last several decades is just cut from the same old cloth of the orginal movies and books that started the whole horror sub-genre of undead creatures (the exception being An American Werewolf in London).The storyline is fantastic, although it might be a bit confusing in the beginning (as a friend of mine said as we were watching it). Just stick with it and it'll all make sense. Think of it as not only a horror movie, but a mystery as well.In my opinion, this movie is a must-see.",Underworld
572,The_Dodge,Better than i expected,10,20 September 2003,"There is a great war between Vampires and Lycans (Werewolf). Selene (A cool Beckinsale, is one of the werewolves who is fighting to avenge her family's death. However she uncovers a plan where the werewolves are looking for a human (Scott Speedman), and its up to her to protect herself and Speedman as both the Werewolves and Vampires search for them. To be honest i expected this film to suck. I mean the tone is similar to Blade, the fight scenes are out of the Matrix, and its got just about everything from every Vampire, Werewolf and Goth film out there. However, Underworld is a pleasant surprise as it tries to at least give put some thought on familiar trodden territory. The storyline is pretty well throughout, even though with the amount of subplots and backstory it does get confusing at times. Beckinsale is excellent as Selene as she seems very capable when it comes to the action scenes, and she wont let fellow Vampires stop her from doing the right thing. She is always focused on acheiving her goal without anyone stopping her. Scott Speedman is perfectly cast as the confused human (Michael) who gets bitten by a Lycan and is protected by Selene from the Lycans who are out to search for him. The action scenes are excellent. From the Vampires using an arsenal of gun s to the camera changing to Werewolves viewpoint (Which is inspired by Sam Raimi), there are some of the best scenes in terms of action you will probably see all year. The only thing i don't like is the sometimes confusing plot and the exposition, but that could be because i expected the film to have a thin storyline when i walked into the cinema. However a few scenes don't work very well which have very little aside from a few characters talking about certain plot points for a few minutes. However this is only a minor quibble and it shouldn't distract from the entertaining film too much. Even though this film hasn't got the budget or hype that other blockbusters films do, it deserves to do as successful as them. Who knows this may even evolve into a cult classic.8/10",Underworld

The werewolf transformations were totally believable and they didn't stick with Hollywood stereotypes when it came to the vampire and werewolf way of life.

Len Wisemen knew what it was he wanted and he delivered. what made this movie so superb was that everything made to make this movie(music, lighting, wardrobe)seemed like it was made FOR this movie. and of course, the cast(along with the makeup crew) added the finishing touches. i won't go into the plot of the movie, but i will tell you that the previews were a bit misleading, in a good way. there is no way any of the previews could possibly show a viewer what this movie has to offer. it's not gothic, it's not romantic, and it's not gory, but it is still a great movie. i will not compare it to any other movie because there is nothing to which i can compare it. just go to this movie to see a good movie, not Oscar winning performances or gratuitous violence. for action, originality, and an overall well made movie, go see Underworld.",Underworld

Yes, Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous and sexy and has the ice-cold assassin schtick down to a T, but that's all there really is to her character - it's so one-dimensional that I couldn't connect with her at all.  The other big problem is that there is zero chemistry between the two leads, infact it all feels a little tacked on.  Add to that your usual charismaless forgettable euro-villains and I just stopped caring about the whole thing really.  OK, so the film's gothic look and style is great, but that's just not enough when you take all the other factors into consideration.  I give this film 3/10",Underworld
588,PJ007,"Blade Vs. Matrix, great movie but small mistakes...",9,18 October 2003,"Underworld is one of those movies that combines legends (like freddy Vs. Jason). There are the wearwolves and vampires who have been fighting eachother for over a 1000 years. The wearwolves are almost fully murdered out but they're still standing... when the blood of one human (michael) seems to be essential in the battle, selene wants to know what is going on while she starts digging in the history of the vampires and why this war started. This is a great movie, vampires in long leather jackets with a certain type of ""elegance"", wearwolves that turn in to beasts that would turn the hulk into a whimp, and most of all: action/shooting scenes that you love to see without the overdose of gore. I think the name horror/thriller is a little bit exagerated because there's no real ""scare"" factor, just a lot of (good) action. The only things that bothered me in this movie were the little mistakes. The vampire-myth says that vampires have no shadow or reflection whilst in the movie, selene is looking in the mirror... The entire movie there are guns, guns and more guns, with specific bullets to kill the other species ect... but at one fight between a vampire and a wearwolf, the vampire suddenly takes 2 whips. A spectacular scene but why didn't he just shoot the wearwolf? To conclude, a great movie with a great mythic story and great action scenes, but if Len Wiseman (director) wants to follow a myth, he has to follow it entirely..",Underworld

I am also a avid gamer of White Wolf's Vampire the Masquerade RPG and I was hoping that this movie would be similar to the game. My hopes were dashed however. This movie is anything but interesting. I was bored the first half of the movie and unimpressed the second. The characters meant nothing to me except Lucian and that's only because of what he had to go through.The ending was anticlimactic and simple.

From the beginning you can appreciate how well thought out the story is. I didn't think Kate Beckinsale could pull off the strong warrior type role, but she surprised me how she could have the sweetest face and still be a strong warrior (Trinity definitely is not alone in the warrior female domain).The movie is combined with several elements that I love in movies (interesting story, well executed action scenes, excellent characters and actors who play them, etc.)I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did (watch out for a sequel).",Underworld

""Underworld"" does not explain much from the start; I wouldn't have known half of what was going on if I hadn't read about it first. Explanitory things means everything. Second thing, this movie didn't really make you want to root for either side, Lycans OR vampires. The lycans are just egomanic psychos and the vampires are all arrogant traitors. Too bad they didn't all kill each other. On the other hand, the graphics were nice, interesting and vivid (although they didn't have to make so many 5-story window jumping scenes....). Selene(Beckinsale) made a very sexy, slinky vamp. What can I say? I love females who fight. They make the battle more interesting. I think this movie would have been a LOT better if they had explained things along the way. And the ending needed some help as well. Overall, it was ""OK"". Not something I would pay to see again though.B-",Underworld

The plot is interesting but the script is unintentionally funny sometimes (like when characters EXPLICITLY explain the whole story again in case someone left for popcorn). The romance was out of place and awkward, so its good it wasn't overstressed.Selene's corset and spandax is very reminiscent of the Matrix theme but has a cool vampire edge to it. The UV bullets were pretty creative. Overall good entertainment...wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.",Underworld

After spending a long day seeing films I attended the midnight screening of Underworld.When the film ended the vibe I got from the theater was of utter disappointment.  The film was mainly a dialog based film with as little action that was all seen in the trailers of the film.  I sat their watching bad acting with plotlines and characters I didn't care for.  Now I'm a big fan of all types of films, and I really enjoy ""B"" rated films as well. This film doesn't fall into that category because it tried to take itself so seriously that you don't even care about whats going on.  The director went on stage to do a Question and Answer and I just wanted to say something negative, but thought it would be too rude.  Spending the rest of the week watching films, everybody talked about how they hated Underworld.  The main reason I'm writing this review is I just saw the director talking on SPACE CHANNEL saying how much everybody enjoyed the film at the TIFF and how they just signed a contract to make a sequel.Please don't waste your money to see this film.  I don't want to see this director getting a project that is important and ruining something that can be good.",Underworld

596,flyingirishman-1,Not your typical Vampire movie.,8,20 September 2003,"Before I went to see Underworld I had heard it received poor reviews from the moronic critics, as most movies of this type do. But in my opinion Underworld was a great flick.  It's difficult to make a Vampire movie that is appealing to everyone because not everyone's depiction of a Vampire is the same.  In Blade, Vampires were dark, deadly, killing machines void of emotion.  In Interview With the Vampire there was little violence other than the occasional feeding but the characters were complex and interesting. Underworld finds a pleasing median between the two. Selene, the dark and cold-hearted death dealer, is fighting a war against Lycans. And while she shows off her moves in the fight scenes and shows a hard exterior she still displays that she has feelings with a passionate kiss with Michael Corwin. She is both a lover and a fighter and very rarely do you find a Vampire portrayed in such a manner and I personally found it quite appealing. This is quite obviously NOT your typical Vampire movie and I give it two thumbs up.",Underworld
597,DesiringMachines,Bah,4,20 September 2003,"I think the director took a few too many cues from The Matrix despite lacking the ability to hold such a big story together, and obviously lacking some of the effects budget - the Lycans were cool looking but the fight scenes weren't that great - since when would vampires fight like Marines?

Sure thing.You've got to know what you're getting when you go to the movies, and it was pretty obvious from the get-go that this movie was made with certain limitations.  I didn't expect greatness and i didn't get it.  I got an ever-so-slightly edgy, alternate perspective on the modern mythology of vampires and werewolves.  That's it.  That's all that I expected.There has been a lot of talk about the lack of character development and other things of this nature in this movie.  Er, so?  You're watching a vampire/werewolf face-off.  What, did you expect, ""Shakespeare in Love""-style dialogue?  Yeah, they could have done quite a few things better, and I'm really disappointed that they squandered a neat set of concepts with some freshman faux-paus.  But, such is the life of this type of production and budget.I stick to the 6/10, taking into consideration the genre.

Lots of action and I loved that the writers created this whole world with so many places to go.The action,and special effects were great. The story was intriguing and well done. Lots of room for growth and further development. Hope they do a sequel and explore this universe more.The characters are engaging. I felt for Selene,Michael and Lucian. Kate Beckinsale was sexy and gave a great performance. Scott Speedman did an excellent job. He displayed alot of emotions without saying a world and his character's growth was great and will be interesting to see if they do a sequel. Michael Sheen was good. His character's backstory was telling and well done.Beckinsale and Speedman have amazing chemistry. Their characters have a potentially great love story that is very subtle in this chapter of the Underworld.I recommend this movie to others.",Underworld
600,john-1250,Could have been a lot better.,4,23 September 2003,"SPOILERSOh dear. The movie had its moments, but it was a reasonably good idea marred by poor execution. I think that the makers/distributors were more concerned about making the film watchable for the majority of blokes by putting the lead actress in a leather corset and PVC/Rubber than putting any significant plot or acting in. Even the martial arts (which usually makes me at least open my eyes) was poorly done.I would say a scripting and directing disaster. I struggled for emotional involvement (normally not a problem for me). I really didnt care if Kate/Love Interest/Anyone else snuffed it. My heart didnt leap into my mouth when she was placed in a difficult situation, it yawned. Character development was cursory, at best. Normally it was pretty much entirely non-existent.It's an OK action film, the locations are pretty good, but its really no better than taking two races which are generally known to prey on humans and getting them to fight each other instead. It's Freddie vs Jason, or Aliens vs Predator.Actually, I've just thought. It could have got worse. They could have had Kate and Love Interest having sex. I suspect that they will reserve that delicacy [irony here] for Underworld 2, which was blatantly plugged at the end (as opposed to actually having an ending, which whilst not an original idea has been successfully trialed in many good films).Unfortunately, what will make this film sell, and hence result in an even worse sequel, is her and her clothing.For those who regard the film as a masterpiece because of a lead actress in PVC/leather/rubber, I suggest you go rent/buy a film more carefully targeted to your tastes, however you may need to be over 18 to obtain it.",Underworld
601,TanzRemix,Excellent,10,24 September 2003,"It seems like everyone is missing the point.This movie was not designed to be a dramatic masterpiece.  It was designed to keep the crowd entertained through a well put together visual experience, and in that regard it succeeds.I thought the acting in the movie was fine... Kahn was great, perfect for his part. Kraven was an annoying little whiner, which he was cast as, but I can see how having him as the vampires' leader is a little unbelievable. Victor is pretty awesome, perfectly cast. Selene... is just... perfect. I mean, it's not the sex appeal (despite what I've been hearing, c'mon guys, grow up a little.), it's like everything about Beckensale works for this character.  I was talking to one of my friends about it the other day, and he picked up the same thing.  For him, it was that opening sequence (also in the previews) where she jumps from the railing and starts walking... he thought it was like, the perfect walk, and I agree.  Now I can't for the sequel.The only real flaw I saw in the movie was the final battle (**Possible Spoiler**)...First off, he (Michael) looks essentially retarded.  Wouldn't you expect the spawn of a vampire and a werewolf who is supposed to be stronger than both to be a total badass?  No, he's like a scaled down hulk.  Then, he gets destroyed by Victor... what?  I would expect a long hard fight with Mike coming out on top, not Selene bailing him out.  Speaking of Selene bailing him out, how dumb looking was that decapitation thing?  Total weak sauce. Nonetheless, these are minor details that come at the end of an awesome movie.",Underworld

Werewolves (how serious can that possibly BE taken?) movie.  It was fun, kept moving, with sharp effects and a coherent story line.

Did anyone notice how Kraven's face twitched every time he spoke? Did anyone believe that there was chemistry between Seline and Michael?  Or how about the multiple subplots?  Multiple family members dying (parents, daughter, nieces) leading to revenge, secrets, and lies; then there are the power hungry vampires; forbidden love (in every direction)-it just seems like they stretched this movie too far. They should have just stuck with one thing instead of trying to squeeze it all in.  Don't get me wrong, the first half hour was mildly enjoyable, but then it just went down hill. It is a shame it had such potential.  But basically, in the end, to me, it was a bad movie that I wouldn't spend $3 dollars to rent.",Underworld

605,cyberc0y0te,A fun movie,8,30 September 2003,"I'm absolutely amazed at the negative criticism this film is getting. The points that are spat upon by the bad reviews are best addressed by another review I saw above, but a short summary is included herein anyway. I think the biggest problems folks have with this movie is their predetermined expectations versus what it really is.This is an action movie, through and through. Instead of gun slinging madmen and unerring good guys you've got Vampires and Werewolves. They make the gray areas some films try to create with questionable cops and criminals with some good intentions even more gray by using two 'evils' as the characters. Maybe that's what drove these critics 'batty', the fact that who is in the right is entirely up to the viewer, the film makers haven't really chosen a side, they merely show the story from a choice few perspectives.Also, just pretend you don't 'know' anything about werewolves or vampires when you go into the film. These are not classic renditions of the two creatures as presented in other books or films, they are new angles on both, and you'll have to watch the whole movie to get the over all truth behind their legends. I've seen people complain that vampires don't get to turn into bats and that they cast reflections...so? This is not Dracula or Blade, this is Underworld. It is it's own story. With some simple dialogue the entire history, both myth and 'real', is set for the audience. If you never heard of either creature the movie explains what they are to you within the parameters of the film.The action sequences are a treat, the unbelievable stunts pulled off by the characters easily acceptable as they are far from human. In MI II or Charlie's Angels it's just silly or an insult to your intelligence as the characters are supposed to be 'real'. These are not humans and the wild line work mixes well within the physical limitations that are set for them.The acting and dialogue is not any worse than any other action yarn, actually sitting much higher in my eyes than performances in embarassingly poorly acted blockbusters like 'Spider-Man'. I found the plot twists well done, and the slight love story which is a reflection of one of the story's plot bases well done.Another thing that impressed me about the movie was the lack of cartoonish CGI effects. SpiderMan, Hulk, Blade, even sometimes the Star Wars flicks had some computer generated character animations that were so poor one wondered why they were included. Maybe because they were on a limited budget the Underworld producers did more of the work 'the old fashioned way', and it came off well.If you expect twelve Oscar nominations from every movie you see, then don't bother. If you want a fun ride with well done photography, a thumping soundtrack (David Bowie's in there!), near non-stop action, and bestial werewolves that fear next to no other denizens of the night, then check it out. Oh, the story was pretty good too.",Underworld
606,adrenalinex,some great twists and underlying meaning,8,30 September 2003,"I really liked this movie.

There actually is a multi-layered plot that unfolds as the movie progresses. I look forward to the sequels that are currently on the drawing board for this film due to the room left in the story by the writers. The violence and action are not over-done or full of gore.  The look of the movie is simple and clean while at the same time remaining dark. The film focuses more on the scientific rather than the fantastical elements of vampires.

609,mmrufflo,action makes up for the poorly done script...,7,3 October 2003,"I don't know why reviews were squashing this movie. Mabye because it was about vampires again! Perhaps because it was a perfect mixture of the Matrix and Blade II. Whatever it was, I don't care. I thought the movie was fun and quite enjoyable to watch. It had some good actors, a good plot, and a TON of ACTION.To me, a movie doesn't have to be all story. They basically got the story in about a total of twenty minutes so what to do about the other one hour and forty-one minutes left? ACTION! Why not amaze the audience with some horror, gore and fun? The warewolves changing were very new and different from the old changes. The effects were great and the actors worked well with it. Kate Beckinsale did a fine, not great job playing Selene. She wore the leather well and spoke the lines perfectly. The other actors did fine too but MY GOD; what was with Shane Brolly's (Kraven's) role! I think he just, well....sucked. He did a terrible job and I believe he could have been replaced. It would have made the movie better. One bad actor can screw up a whole movie. Besides that, the acting was great.In the reviews, they talked up how rediculous the romance was between Selene and Michael. Only one problem with that, there wasn't any! They shared one meaningless kiss and then they went back to the beautiful ACTION.So bottom line, if you don't like vampires, darkness, The Matrix, or ACTION-don't see this.",Underworld
610,Pandoras_Box1979,Underworld ROCKS!!!!,10,5 October 2003,"Being a huge Kate Beckinsale & Scott Speedman fan...I seriously enjoyed Underworld because it has alot of action and excitement in it. But there is more to it than action and excitement...personally I thought it was a love story.I mean to say the whole reason behind the vampire vs werewolf war is all because Sonia (Victor's daugther) and Lucian fell in love with each other...since werewolves were the servants and lower class to the vampires...it is forbidden for servants to get intimate with the masters & mistresses. And to make matters worst Sonia was carrying Lucian's child which made Victor really ticked off and he wouldn't allow her to have a half breed (half werewolf)...I guess in a sense victor was prejudice gainst the werewolves cause he had his daughter burnt alive by the sunlight as poor Lucian watched...chained down to the floor like some dog...man my heart went out to him...So, I do not blame him for wanting revenge on Victor for killing his lover and unborn childSo, that is why I think behind all the action and excitement lies a beautiful but very sad love story but also there is another story goin on there...story of betrayal of trust...Victor lead Selene to believe that a pack of werewolves brutally murdered her family when in truth it was him who was behind it...I mean damn...that is really evil right there...I guess it is obvious that the only character that I truly hate out of the movie was Victor cuz man...he is evil!!!!But seriously...this movie is a damn good movie!!!! I mean if you have not seen it...you have got to go and see it as it is a MUST SEE!!! I know it look alot like the Matrix and all that but trust me...is nothing like the Matrix or any other vampire/werewolf movie out there for this is one of the best vampire/werewolf movies I have ever seen in my life!!!And Kate Beckinsale as a warrior vampress...omg!!!! She totally rocks as a vampress!!!! Seriously!!! I hope she does more vampire roles in the future and I also hope you guys make a sequel to Underworld cause this movie truly does ROCKS!!!I cannot wait till it come on DVD cause I will be one of the first to pre order or buy my copy of it on DVD!!!!!

613,Silverraindrop23,The good and the bad of underworld,8,8 November 2003,"Yes this movie had some faults but overall I Thought it was good I liked how for once we had a woman main vampire that kicked butt also i liked how different this movie was from other vampire movies (you know like seeing them feasting on humans)I also like the whole idea of a thing(hybrid) stronger than a lycan and a vampire put together.Another really cool thing was the winding road it took from viktor being this saint to becoming the bad guy.And I loved how you got to know lucian and what he was about from his memories. But a big problem in this movie was the ""romance"" between Selene and Michael they said it was supposed to be like a Romeo and Juliet trapped in this chaotic setting  but really i saw that they showed very little attraction toward each other (fine example of this was the ending where you see Selene and Michael she looks back at him and just walks off you know they could have maybe hugged to show that they were going to survive this war or even a nod would have worked  but no Selene looks back at Michael with a look that shows little or no emotion and just walks away and Michael just stands there with no expression on his face and follows Selene)  so they kissed I am sorry but you can just put a kiss in a movie and say there is a romance in it but still i thought they would have played out the romance a little more than they did and i thought they could have explains things a lot better in the movie like who's blood could be used to make someone a hybrid PS trust me i am not trying to tick anyone off here I enjoyed the movie I am just showing it's faults",Underworld

An 8 might be a little high, but I was in the mood for this type of movie when I watched it and it didn't disappoint. A very good plot with lots of twists and unique ideas. One thing I didn't like, however, was the major lack of vampires being vampires. You assumed the vampires were powerful, but they really didn't show you. Theycould also have played up the erotic and sensual aspects more. I would've been happy with more fangs and less guns. The overuse of blazing guns made mostof the movie seem a bit too Matrix-wannabe. Whereas with most movies likethese, the plot is usually what lacks, with this one it was the strength.

616,aldenbach,"Light on gore, good character development, consistent story",8,6 January 2004,"Putting aside all of the rhetoric about realism, Matrix rip-offs, and vampire/werewolf lore consistency, this movie stands as a rare gem because it is both intriguing and consistent unto itself.The film is light on gore (only two moderate scenes) with heavy action sequences using submachine pistols and rifles.  Don't expect to see vampires and werewolves ripping apart humans (thank goodness...)!  Both species are more concerned in killing each other, and humans are just collateral damage.This film (thankfully) generates its own refreshing ambience and lore concerning the origins and lives of vampyres and werewolves (a.k.a lycanthropes).  For example, vampires live under a code preventing the consumption of human blood, with livestock blood being the acceptable entree.  Thus, the reason why we (that's you and I) don't see or read about people dying from bite marks on their necks.The acting was quite acceptable, with the exception of one of the main characters (Michael Corvin) who either had a bad script, or just can't act. I actually don't like gore/horror movies at all and had no plans to see this one until I read a review which described the film as more of an action/intrigue flick rather than a lunch tosser.  What a pleasant surprise it was to be able to view this movie 4 times and still be learning interesting details about the storyline.If you liked the ambience of the Matrix, and are tired of the same old boring vampire/werewolf storyline, then this movie should be high on your list.

Calling this movie anything less than great, that's also what you'd get if you were telling a lie. However, the opposite of this, the truth, that's what I'm talking about.If you like movies, you like Underworld.  If you like talking trash about every movie you see, you hate Underworld.  It's simple.  This movie is a brilliant work on many different levels.  First off, the writing.  What most people notice.  Dialogue, all that stuff.  It's not forced, it isn't pretentious, it isn't a let down at all.  The only downside as far as that field is the fact that several important plot points are delivered by a guy with a nearly unintelligible accent.Now, the plot.  The plot is nice.  There's actually a very well delivered twist that I didn't catch onto until immediately before it happened, and I'm the guy that ruined Fight Club for himself be figuring out that Jack was Tyler.  Still a great movie.I digress.  Onto the directing.  The style was eerily reminiscent of Fincher, his work previously mentioned.  Several shots seemed lifted straight from a Fincher work, while others paid great homage to the Wachowski brothers, but that was no surprise.  The surprise was the influence garnered from old Hong Kong action flicks.  Great gunplay.Other crap, they used animatronics instead of CGI, which is always a plus. Blah blah blah, watch the damned movie and like it.",Underworld
619,brennerl,Like watching The Matrix with vamps and werewolves,7,22 January 2004,"While certainly not the best or the worst of its type, Underworld borrows a great deal from a number of other recent sci-fi and horror flicks -- costumes and action sequences from The Matrix, scenery and set design from Batman, and the not-so-original story pieced together from any number of romantically-influenced action/drama films (think Baz Luhrman's version of Romeo and Juliet after you substitute vampires and werewolves for most of the otherwise human cast).On the other hand, production qualities are very good, and the reasonably talented and mostly believable cast is not entirely unknown.  Besides, watching the very attractive Kate Beckinsale parade around in a series of leather and latex outfits is not a terrible way to spend an evening.Traditionalists may be offended that the writers have taken certain liberties with the usual vampire and werewolf ""rules"" (at least direct sunlight still fries the vamps), but I believe most supernatural monster fans (including myself) can just let these things slide, and enjoy the movie for what it is.",Underworld
620,puknula,Are these really vampires,1,22 January 2004,"what kind of a vampire has thunder and lightning going off outside his windows ALL the time, cant see in the dark so he uses torches, can be locked up in a room with key, cant move faster than a human, and uses mobile phones to communicate their evil plans, whilst speaking really softly so that the others dont hear??? i mean, come on, if you're going to invent new species who just live in cool houses and PRESUMABLY drink blood for a living, why not just call them ""goths with guns""??",Underworld
621,dollardollar,8/10 - Good action/story mix,7,2 February 2004,"I think this movie is worth watching it, especially if you are an action fan. After the trailer I wasn't too sure about its quality because this black/blue style seemed quite boring to me. But in fact it perfectly supported the atmosphere. The best feature of this movie is the balance between action and story. There are good action scenes (although the fights were a bit short) and the story has some interesting turns. Matrix Reloaded concentrated too much on dialogues and philosophical crap. On the other hand, ""Swat"" was a pure action movie and the sole purpose of the story line was to connect the action scenes. In my opinion, ""Underworld"" found an almost perfect balance between those extremes. I missed a bit some special abilities of the vampires, but this is only a minor complaint",Underworld

Yes, it has fighting and shiny PVC, vampires and action a plenty - it also has an interesting storyline and some emotive acting. Films such as Equilibrium also seem to suffer with too many comparisons being raised and in doing so viewers miss the point of the movie itself. Watch this movie with an open mind and I am very sure that the tension, action, excitement and the rather attractive Kate Beckinsale leaping around in her skin tight PVC will change your mind and allow you to enjoy one of the more underrated movies of 2003.",Underworld
625,asterope42,"If a wampire and a vampcan had a baby, would it be stronger than both?",3,7 July 2005,"NO! And if that makes any sense, this movie is for you.Even genre fans might have trouble stomaching the lame plot devices, run-around story, cardboard acting, and multiple resurrections of seemingly dead characters. Not that resurrecting them would make us care about them any more.Now if these were the only horrors viewers had to undergo, it might be a pleasant B movie. But with the addition of the implausible love story (Imetyoutheothernight,andwetalked,letskiss), koolaid-jacked elder, and allusions to even more characters we neither know nor care about, it becomes unbearable. And where the **** was Marcus, Elder number 3? The only reason I lasted the whole movie was because I was hoping Marcus was hot. Based on the corpse with the glowing eyes... no, he was not.The generous three rating is based on the cool outfits, unintentional comedy, and ancient bling. It might have gotten a higher rating if Amelia, a character I was actually interested in seeing more of, hadn't bit the big one via a ridiculous setup.In the words of one movie viewer, ""let's get a clay pigeon launcher and a rifle and take this DVD out back...""",Underworld
626,My_Dragon,What about the vampire rules,3,12 January 2005,"The movie was a nice idea but did not work in the end. the end fight the writers wimped out and had to have Kate Beckinsale had to join in the fight. which can of made the hybrid pointless. Some Pros about the film nice art direction, the special effects were nice not amazing (all effects are overrated) the make-up was good as well as the costumes that is all I have to say about that. Here are couple of the personal qualms with the film.1. Vampires do not have a reflection and yet Kate Beckinsales Character does. Odd I think so too.2. If you kill the head vampire everyone changes back to human. That did not happen when the head vampire died. Yes he was the head vampire! 3.Vampires can control Werewolves so the idea for the movie is nice but not possible. A fact I am willing to over look. Do not go throwing the fact that I am willing to over look one fact without overlooking the others, I am aware of this",Underworld
627,fliss111,my comments are a good thing!!,10,4 April 2004,"An excellent movie i thought, as i am into vampire gothic ,action movies. I liked the fact that it was a sexy, strong female playing one of the leading roles. Scott Speedman and Micheal Sheen are two very attractive actors that also keeps you interested in the film. Bill person who played viktor was a good choice, it is cool to see him play like a gothic character as you see him in a different light compared to his ""take the mick"" amusing character in love actually. The story line is a good one as well with clever twists and brilliantly thought out as i didn't know which side to like more when you find out what ""viktor"" did to his daughter and what started the war. It is an amazing film, probably one of the best vampire films i have seen. I've watched this film about 10 times and i am not bored yet!",Underworld
628,sirenawolf,"I am intrigued, though a bit disappointed.",8,18 April 2004,"I do enjoy the movie. i just wish the wolves had a third state, being actual wolves. plus, I'm sorry but they are hideous creatures, there is no sexual aura to the werewolves as is what is expected. the vampyres, such as when Selene faints due to blood loss, seem all too human. i also wish the lives and feeding of the vampyres were more in depth. it did not even skim their lives. we never once saw a feeding, and is that not what makes a vampyr a vampyr? yes,i hope that the sequel will not fall short of expectations and that it will go into the lives of each. i must admit, the choice of actors was superb! Kate and Scott are both attractive and take to the screen well. Plus, he's down right sexy as a hybrid.",Underworld

Not only did Underworld have a deep and twisting plot line, Selene (Kate Beckinsdale) kicked some serious a**. I have recomended this movie to all my friends, and most loved it. I know that alot of people hated it and thought it sucked, and I respect that. My own family has considered Underworld a mind-less, gory, just fighting movie (not that I'm saying it's not gory, it is!). Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I just wanted ya'll to know mine. *Beaming with happiness*, Marie",Underworld
630,captainzc1414ad,Awesome movie,10,27 July 2006,"I'm a little late on this one but I have to do it. When Underworld came out in theaters back in '03, I never went to see it. I thought it was a gay vampire thing. Well one night I was watching starz movie channel and suddenly I was immersed in a world of vampires and lycans. It was way sweet. I'm like who is this hot chick whoopin azz and hey cool its Michael sheen, hey that guy is a werewolf..I mean lycan (hope this doesn't qualify as spoiling). I still didn't think much of it, I was too young to appreciate it. Now being about 3 years older I know now what I was missing. I am totally hooked into the Underworld Culture. To me it was dead until a recent revival at the beginning of the week, my deepest regret is not seeing the movies at the theater :(. Its probably because I didn't wanna go by myself and none of my friends were really into that kinda thing, and neither was I at one time. I mean I am seriously disappointed because I have been asking and none of my friends have seen this movie and only 2 of them have seen the sequel. But hopefully this will change, I am wandering aren't I? I seriously cannot stop watching this movie and the interesting and powerful sequel. I have been watching them every night for the past week. Overall this film is awesome and I highly recommend it. There is really no comparison for me, I have honestly found my very favorite movie of all time. The Underworld Franchise has made me reconsider my life and now I have finally decided what I will study in college and what I want to do as a career. Similar movies are the matrix and van helsing but they don't even come close.",Underworld
631,jenng7,The best,10,10 May 2004,"I have seen almost all the Vampire movies that have ever been made, and Underworld blows all the others away. Absolutely the best Vampire movie ever made. Kate Beckinsale's performance as Selene is outstanding. She makes you feel what you are seeing is real. The chemistry between she and Scott Speedman was awesome. It had several of the best action sequences that I have seen in any film in a long time. And this did not come off as cheesy at any point in my opinion, which is a HUGE accomplishment. Most Vampire films you end up going oh PLEASE! And you feel like your back watching one of those really awful B horror flix. NOT so here, this one was a winner from start to finish. I can't wait for the sequel!",Underworld
632,mark-hall,I Can't Believe I watched the whole thing...,3,14 June 2004,"Not, mind you, that this movie is incredibly long; it's a minute over 2 hours if you include the credits.No, the reason that this movie was so long was because it was extraordinarily poorly done. There were parts that were worthwhile, but they mostly fell into the eye candy category (such as Kate Beckinsdale in a PVC catsuit). The Lycans, which are going to be the special effects centerpiece of almost any movie involving werewolves, looked okay... until someone decided that they needed to run along walls and ceiling, at which points they looked strained and robotic.The vampires, unfortunately, seem in no way vampiric. Yes, we have one of them leap to the ceiling and bare her fangs. Yes, they jump off buildings with aplomb and flair. But, as near as we can tell, they are acrobats with bad dental hygiene. Only the Big Bad really ever acts like a vampire, but most of his blood comes from tubes in the back of his head. They're apparently allergic to sunlight, but their mansion has big, airy, windows in nearly every room. Does garlic affect them? What about religious icons?As for the rest, however, it really wasn't worth the time. For example, you have Selene (Kate Beckinsdale) begin the movie with a monologue about how this secret war has been going on for ""the better part of a thousand years.""And then the first step in this secret war is for people to shoot up a busy subway with fully automatic weapons. You have elder vampires ""leapfrogging through time"", but no explanation as to why, or what the covenant they keep mentioning is about. The main ""technobabble"" part of the plot is never clear... how is Michael going to unite these bloodlines? Why was Amelia's blood necessary if Selene also had to bite him? None of it is explained in a way that makes things clear and, while everything might have made sense to the characters, they're not the ones you're making this kind of movie for.Time is also handled poorly in this movie, as you get no real sense of it passing between scenes. Did Michael complete the change early, or was there a day in between those two? We don't know. Time just happens, and the audience doesn't see it or know about it.Lastly, the final fight, the penultimate scene, wherein the Big Bad does. not. notice. that. his. head. has. been. cut. in. half. Selene jumps, she slices, she lands. The Big Bad whirls around, shoots two short-swords from up his sleeves... and only notices that his head has been cut in half when he sees blood.The premise had potential. The execution should have been just that... an execution.",Underworld
633,cronebone2000,Horror flick? Nope way more action,9,16 June 2004,When I saw the movie for the first time. I was told it was a horror flick and that there were some freaky parts. I watched the entire movie and not once did horror come to mind. This is an action flick that just happens to deal with vampires and werewolves. There is not one part of this movie that made me think it was anything but a action movie. If it was a horror there should of been some parts where I was scared and I am easily frightened. This movie isn't even that suspenseful. I really needed to get that out. I keep seeing people say this is a horror flick and it is really annoying me. Other than that i really enjoyed this film. I loved the storyline. Please just no one say this is horror.,Underworld
634,whatdoesitwant,The more I watch the more it gains in merrit,9,2 July 2004,"Contains a very small spoiler.Underworld is obvious and leaning on several recognizable sources, yes. But the story is sound, the pace is good and although I had difficulty with the melodrama of both the Victor and kraven characters the rest of the cast were very fitting. The special effects are convincing, the theatre is only so much overdone as to fit in with the goth setting and yes it is a flick you can watch a second time. Especially Kate and Scott are very sleek. This is much more a drama or a love story than it is a horror flick. If you have to compare it to something, compare it to X-Men. I am a big Buffy fan, so if you imagine going out to your regular dance hall, this flick is more like going to your first goth party compared to that: little conversation, lots of show, much darker, some obvious shock effects, no humor (in the acting), bits of gore and loads of sex appeal. But it has a some parallels as well: a very high soap level, a female lead character and a ""comfy"" setting, even the bits of flesh lying around after a grenade explosion are stylish. The most blatant rip off is the moment where Michael pins Victor to a wall (wolverine in x-men comics), but I don't care, Underworld is truly delicious in its obviousness. I do not tire from watching it. To be honest, I do not understand its low rating. I believe that you are meant to see through the obviousness of the movie and just get into it, something which would be impossible to do with, for example, Van Helsing. But Underworld takes itself seriously at the right levels and is damned sexy.",Underworld
635,blazenthor1,Better than given credit for.,8,12 January 2006,"I read through these review and find it interesting how some people ""got it"" and some must have seen the 1997 Underworld movie with Dennis Leary and done a review for this Underworld by accident. This movie creates a new world in which vampires and lycans don't get along and actually wage war on each other. There are some good performances from most of the leads, with the exception of Scott Speedman (who was given a very short script) and the actor playing Kraven, who terribly overacted his part. Considering the small budget this film had to work with, it's actually pretty well-made technically and attempts to do quite a bit. A solid soundtrack, nice visuals and some good action scenes (not enough for some people, evidently) help create a solid film-going experience. Pacing is sometimes poor (Wiseman's first movie) and some shots are questionable, but this is hardly less than a 6/10 film. When I see lower marks, it makes me think there are either some drama queens watching the movie or people that just didn't pay attention to what was going on on screen.",Underworld
636,mykal_lakim,Underworld is a great movie with phenomenal casting,7,19 September 2013,"Underworld is a great movie with phenomenal casting. The actors did a great job of portraying the characters without that ""empty"" feeling you sometimes get when bad actors are cast in supernatural roles. The characters are rich and integrated into the story without a feeling of overcrowding. Unlike most vampire films which I feel loses that ""gothic"" feel, Underworld brings it all to the table to keep you on the edge of your seat. I loved the way vampires and werewolves were explained, which I felt was an original take, which I felt translated to film in an excellent way. The characters didn't have an ""all of the sudden"" hatred, the reason between any angst is explained and very logical. A great movie from start to finish, I cannot wait to see what else comes from this franchise.",Underworld
637,gwenluv,Overly stylized Under developed,2,2 March 2005,"The entire concept of vampires and werewolves (lycans, yeah whatever) in a long suffering feud was a great idea. Even the idea of one of the races trying to make a hybrid of the two was intriguing. But instead of developing the characters, making them likable, or even interesting, everything is coated in shadows, everyone looks like a perfect goth caricature, and no one shows genuine emotion. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous, even appropriately sullen, but she isn't given much to work with dialog-wise while Scott Speedman is boring and unconvincing and it's sad to see the initially great-sounding plot ultimately take a backseat to tired over stylization and done-to-death action sequences.",Underworld

639,edp521,I get the point already!,4,8 October 2004,"I went to see this movie hoping to see something to rival that masterpiece of below average filmaking, ""Queen of the Damned"". I realize now, that my standards may have been too high. The costumes (and by costumes I mean outfits) were lovely, and this was understandably the selling point of the movie; I won't argue with black leather and castles (let's face it, the scenery, like the cars and weapons, were actually just really cool outfits). Unfortunately, even visually the cast was not up to the task. Kate Beckinsale was reasonably easy on the eyes, but Scott Speedman really wasn't cutting it as a lead role in a movie which should have been largely about eye-candy (cf. Stuart Townsend), and the supporting cast could not really be relied on for support in this area.The visuals, however, could have been overcome, if we didn't have to pause between slow-moving scenes to recap--in painful detail--the plot (presumably for those members of the audience who had ducked out to see if anything better could be found in another theater). I found the big yellow signs captioned ""warning: plot twist ahead"", which appeared at intervals during the stilted dialog, to be distracting to the overall flow of the movie.In a movie of this quality, it is always possible to regain some entertainment value in the category of ""Worse than we could have ever hoped."" I was able, for example, while watching ""Queen of the Damned"", to overlook its worst features by laughing at the recycled effects from other movies (My favorite being the left-over rose petals from ""American Beauty""). In this movie, however, the awkward pauses, and even more awkward plot expositions were simply not funny, and though I tried to laugh, only a slightly embarrassed chuckle would come out.Overall, I am sorry that I was not a quite a bit more drunk when I watched this film. I think passing out occasionally would have really helped the plot along, and also would have made it much more exciting for me.",Underworld

Am I the only one out there who is bored with characters skulking round blue lit, rain soaked streets in figure hugging black PVC, dark sunglasses and trench coats?

Wonderfully woven tale of love, very Romeo and Juliet with great action sequences and I really enjoyed the genetic component of the vampires and lycans existence. I also thought the actors cast in the film could not have been more perfect for the roles. They bring you into the characters and suspend disbelief. Another high point of this feature is the lack of cgi. Terrific throw back to monster making really brought the werewolves out and gave their movements balance and substance.

A special man is drafted into a battle that has been going on for centuries without humans knowledge. Sound familiar? Well if it doesn't, it's also got vampires and werewolves to round the cliché list off.

Scott Speedman was a new face for me but I think that he was a perfect fit for this part. He has an animal-like look and quality to him that really sales him in this role. I felt that he and Kate have a real on screen connection and chemistry that can't be denied. They were totally believable as a couple falling in-love against the odds. Having the this classic conflict existing between vampires and werewolves gave this movie just the right twist as well. Honestly, I think that with the realities of the world today, Underworld was just what the doctor ordered in terms of escapism. What a nice break from the ""real world"".

649,Warwolf243,This movie was a complete BUST,1,19 April 2005,"Underworld was a travesty.A complete and utter travesty.This movie was touted as featuring a battle between werewolves and vampires. Yet the movie rarely saw any real combat besides overly clichéd gun battles. The plot, for much of the movie is non-existent. Werewolves were once slaves to vampires until one werewolf (just a side note werewolves are called Lycans in this film, by the way) took a vampire for a bride. Her father, Viktor, kills his own daughter and makes Lucian, the Lycan in question, watch. This starts the war. Mainly cause Viktor feared the creation of a Lycan-Vampire mixed breed.All this comes out in about the last ten to fifteen minutes or so of the movie by the way.Meanwhile, we have Selene, a 'Death Dealer' (a vampire who hunts werewolves), who hunts them out of revenge, falling in love with Michael Corvin (I'm having flashbacks to the hideous Crow 3 here folks, even if the guy's last name IS from Crow 2) who's the descendant of some guy named Corvinus or something like that. Supposedly he has the potential to become both vamp and Lycan. Which he does.And yet in the end it's SELENE who kills off Viktor, who had killed her family 600 years prior to the events of the film. This is another clichéd plot twist. I mean come on. ""Werewolves killed my family, so I kill them to satiate my lust for vengeance against werewolves who may have already been killed anyway."" Yeah, who the hell DIDN'T see that coming by the time this movie was ended? Seriously, show of hands.Any takers? No? Good for you. It's too completely obvious.Here's the kicker. Lucian (Lucien?) has been trying to turn himself into a cross-breed Lycan-Vamp, which would make him more powerful than either race. Well, as you might expect, Michael gets bitten by a Lycan. Goes through most of the movie having 'hallucinations' which are actually Lucian's memories of what started the war between the two races. Gets shot and nearly dies because of some idiot SOB (who is Viktor's second in command of course.), gets bitten by Selene, and becomes the hybrid Viktor is so afraid of seeing come into existence. Cue the only DECENT fight scene in this movie. Viktor and Michael go at it pretty well. It looks like it's going to become the sole redeeming quality in this movie. Then Viktor gets Michael in a headlock. (Hey, when did this turn into a wrestling match?) Guess what. Selene gets involved and slices Viktor's head in half diagonally.Making the concept that Michael is supposed to be more powerful than both Lycans and Vampires (and let me point out here that Lycans in this film are also supposed to be immortal once changed, and that all either race has to do is a simple bite.), abso-fricking-lutely POINTLESS! Whoever wrote this movie must have been on crack. I mean it. The story was contrived, the 'fight scenes' shallow except for Michael vs. Viktor, and they actually managed to RUIN that fight by having Selene get in the killing blow. This type of flagrant sexism in horror movies in which the villain/monster/alien from beyond/whatever almost always dies at the hands of a woman has always dragged down my enjoyment of most horror flicks in general, and utterly annoys me throughout Underworld as Selene is like a female Blade in reverse with NONE of the potential that Blade has to be in potential danger even if he's just faking it. I never get the impression that Selene is in any way harmable because she's far too much like Blade mixed with the Punisher mixed with Daredevil. She also is the driving force of this film, which means that Michael, whom she's supposed to be in love with, and who, from the apparent standpoint of the movie, is supposed to be the character around which all of this utter stinkbomb revolves, is little more than a footnote, and appears in barely a quarter of the movie. He is more or less just a helpless idiot throughout most of the film. Then, they remove any power and presence his transformation is supposed to give him by not only having Viktor in a position to kill him, which should have ended with Viktor's hold being broken by Michael's supposedly superior strength speed and power, but by having him be rescued by Selene, who has basically been the only character who really DOES -anything- in this entire movie.I put off buying Underworld for almost two years because I was wary of it. Mostly because of the way I disliked the werewolf costumes in the trailers. I will admit, I have come to like the werewolf suits, but not enough to consider them a saving grace of the film.This film managed to ruin the one thing which could have redeemed it in my eyes. And sadly, it hints at a possible sequel at the end with another of the Vampires who is supposedly as old as Marcus and possibly a halfbreed himself taking over as the main villain. Which means this pile of utter waste is likely going to have a baby brother.Avoid it at all costs folks. This movie was a bomb. BIG TIME.As a fan of both werewolves and vampires, I feel embarrassed on behalf of both creatures for this disgusting film.",Underworld
650,Pamelap0512,It is the best movie. I can't wait to see the next one.,10,23 April 2005,"This movie is definitely one of my favorites.It didn't look good at first but then my friend showed me the movie and I LOVED it so much that the next day I went out and bought. My whole family loves it. The director did an excellent job on the making of this film. I would of never guessed that Kate Beckinsale could do the things she did in the movie because she seemed more like the chick-flick kind of girl in Serendipity, and Scott Speedman was extremely talented in this movie. I would recommend it to my friends and I already have. Underworld will just keep you coming back for more and more. The next movie is probably going to be as thrilling as the first. I will definitely be first in line at the box office to see the next Underworld. I can't wait for the next one.",Underworld
651,aran_turgon,A lot Better Than Expected,8,29 May 2005,"When Underworld was release in the theaters I didn't bother seeing it, because of the bad reviews. I recently rented it because the video store didn't have anything better to offer, that I had not already seen, and I must say that I was very much surprised. It was far better than expected. I especially liked the acting of Bill Nighy as the vampire lord Viktor, and Micheal Sheen as the werewolf leader Lucian. I think that the plot is quite strong, and it does not ruin the vampire or werewolf legend. What i didn't like as much was the werewolf costumes. I didn't find the convincing. But apart from that, it was very entertaining, and I am looking forward to see the sequel i the theaters.",Underworld
652,happyhobbit91,It was different- but good,8,2 September 2005,"This movie surprised me. I first heard about it through a friend, but I never really went to see it in theaters. I finally saw it in July of 05 with a friend, and it was after I had read the novelization with Greg Cox.(which happens to be way more Goryier and it has way more plot)I thought the plot spanned to more than just Matrix/Romeo & Juliet W/ Vampires & werewolves. It had a bunch of subplots and sometimes they confused me. I thought that the best performances came from Kate Beckinsale as the Warrior Selene, Bill Nighy as the Head Honcho Vampire Viktor, and Michael Sheen as Lucian, the presumed Dead werewolf. Scott Speedman did an alright job as the human Michael, who get's caught up in the mess, but sometimes, he just looked like a wounded puppy. What really annoyed me the most was the way Shane Brolly(Kraven) who kept switching his accent from American to Irish. But other than that, the movie was pretty good. The cinematography was really cool, and the werewolves were pretty good for non CG. I would have liked more back story though, like what happened to Michael's Girlfriend, even though I had already seen it in the book. Oh well. That's what the extended version is for, right?",Underworld
653,tavdy79,Wow,10,30 April 2005,"There are some movies which have eye-widening or before-their-time special effects. There are some movies with beautifully crafted music, costumes & sets. There are some movies with actors worth watching purely for their acting ability. There are some movies with genuinely interesting story lines.There are few movies or TV series which have all four in such perfect balance they could be watched over and over and you would not easily tire of them. The Matrix is one such movie. Lord Of The Rings is three. The Passion Of The Christ is one. Babylon 5 and the UK edition of Queer As Folk provide the TV offering. Underworld is also quite justifiably in this list.The special effects are brilliant, but they're not the purpose of the movie - they exist to carry the plot, rather than the other way round, and they are nowhere pushed further than they need be. The CG animation of the Lycans changing, and the Lycan body-suits, are brilliant.The sets and costumes are a well-balanced and sometimes imaginative blend of classic Vampire Goth and Matrix-style Cybergoth (which is probably why the film got so many Matrix comparisons - other than the set and costume design, which is inevitable with the genre, the underground station shootout is the only similarity - and unlike the Matrix, the sequence HAS to take place in an underground station for various reasons). Kraven's suit and the Death Dealer uniforms were especially good.I found only one actor whose performance I was disappointed with - and he was only on screen for ten seconds, and the contribution was so minimal his part could theoretically have been eliminated entirely. Beckinsale's performance was exemplary, especially given the number of lines she had, but for acting I'd say the best were Shane Brolly's Kraven and Bill Nighy's Viktor - two of the most scheming, manipulative and yet distinctly different characters you could imagine.The story line was the real gem though. Double-dealing on top of skulduggery laid over some pretty advanced genetics, all mixed with a heavy dose of romance, a dash of genocide, and stirred well by some of the best twists I've seen in a while, then set in an epic scale of events. Yet it still managed to be driven by the characters' personalities as much as the situation!Anyone who doesn't mind needles, body parts, blood and some pretty nasty ways of killing people will enjoy the film. And if you're worried about nudity, don't - the furthest extent is a few Lycans in wolf-mode, a dehydrated elderly Vampire, the delectable Scott Speedman (unfortunately obscured under a load of latex and body-paint), and a couple of bloodied male torsos.",Underworld

655,alex4jesus,One of the best Vampire- Werewolf movie ever made,10,21 May 2005,"I'd like this movie because it was so very concise, precise. The detail given was awesome. The movie slightly complicated but each time I viewed the movie more detail was brought to my attention this is what made it spectacular. The action sequences, the plot was on target. What can i say but simply spectacular!!!People may not like the movie because of many reasons, one it contains were wolves and vampires, not many people like a dark setting. Also, if it has been viewed in a hasty manner it'll never be appreciated. Kate was good since much depth hasn't been given to her yet the character Selene comes into life as cold deadly death dealer. The plots and counter plots were great when we start to realize that it was Lucius(Micheal Sheen) who happens to be the typical good guy. It brings out the selfishness and insecurity of beings whether they be Vampire or Were wolves. Physically they appeared to be stronger and mightier than us but emotionally they r as fragile as we are. Thats what made it spectacular....",Underworld
656,reaper2892,Bad In Every Respect,1,11 October 2008,"The movie delivers nothing at all plain and simple. The characters are truly poorly written, the acting is horrid, the action is barely there, the music sounds like some horrible KMFDM rip off. Lets start off with the characters, wow vampires being euro trash......groundbreaking, werewolves being brutish.......who would of thought? i mean seriously here people the characters in this film were ALL one dimensional, the dialog was wretched and contrived. Now moving on to the acting, this is gonna be rough, there is 1 good actor in the film: Bill Nighy, everyone else is absolutely dreadful, Beckinsale chews scenery like nobody i have ever seen before, though thats nothing new for her, the chemistry between her and speedman is ice cold, not to mention there is no reason for either of them to like each other, they don't warm up to each other or have a change of heart, the dialog is so stilted that it generally feels like these two people have no desire for the project, its obviously just a paycheck for both of them. The Action......well there wasn't much at all so whats to say really, just very boring run of the mill action scenes WHEN they do occur,which isn't often. The music keeps in theme with the vampires being eurotrash, its all synthetic, pulsing garbage to try and inspire angst into the pathetic little goth losers who seem to be in love with this movie, its KMFDM without the point.Plain and simple folks, this movie is horrid, the sequel is worse, avoid it at ALL costs",Underworld

There's a beautiful leading lady, it has Matrix costumes, it has an interesting back story, some cool action sequences and even some romance... And this is a vampire movie with even a few twists up its sleeve, and how often does that happen? This movie requires, however, letting go the typical ideas carved in stone by the likes of Bram Stoker's Dracula or Blade, which was itself a kind of reaction against the anti-Christian figure of the vampire (crucifixes do not work etc.). Underworld builds its own vampire/werewolf (or 'lycan' as it is called in the movie) universe and does so in a rather believable manner. I saw that a sequel is underway, so hell yeah, I'm going to watch it as soon as I can...",Underworld
658,WaveTown_Balla,"Great plot, weak directing",7,9 June 2006,"All i can comment on is that the directing of this film was horrible. Yes, they did a good job making it look dark as well as re-imagining the werewolves. But it is just so unrealistic and copies so many other movies. It is basically Blade, turned into a women and instead of humans Vs. Vampires, its Lycans Vs. Vampires. The problems i see in this are the little things, like Kate emptying 100+ bullets into the floor and than falling through, when each of those guns probably has 15-20 bullets max. But, it's a movie, so thats OK, people don't reload anyone. Another thing that got annoying was how untouchable Kates character was compared to all others. 5 people jump in before her, all get shot, she jumps in not touched, than the next 5 after her all get shot. But other than that type of stuff the acting wasn't all that bad and the action was pretty good. This was a lot better than the sequel i feel",Underworld

Bill Nighy was incredible as the Vampire Elder Viktor. The plot was amazing and extremely well thought out. You couldn't ask for better or more realistic special effects!

The story to a film might be lame, the sets and production may be lame but put Kate Beckinsale on the centre spot and her charisma and enthusiasm carries any film! You don't have to be a nerd or a lover of Ms Beckinsale to watch this film, you don't have to be a fantastical admirer of the myth about vampires or werewolves to want to watch this film - you want tongue in cheek poke at everything that comes before it? You want a totally different take on the differences and grievances that have been told countless times from cartoon to cinematic experience about the distrust between vampires and wolves? Then watch this film - it has everything from the one-liners to the deliberate over the top action scenes that just states cult from start to finish. This film tackles the myth issue that a certain other film trilogy (ahem - blatant plug for Blade) dared to tackle - yeah it is that obvious that while production for Underworld 2 is in progress, you either know that the current director or somebody under them is already planning the third and final instalment! All I can say is that if it includes Kate Beckinsale and stays close to the first film then you will find me first in the queue to see it! You want a brash, in your face and go grab for the history books film then see this! Who cares if there is the odd blunder in it, who cares if it lacks a story and is so far fetched that is nonsense in it - it contains vampires and werewolves and is every kids fantasy - oh and it has Kate Beckinsale looking mighty fine as well!

It has a great storyline, you can imagine yourself being there as the movie progresses.
My favourite characters are Lucian, Raze and Rigel.

While I do tend to enjoy a good vampire movie more than the average person, this impressed me with its story (well crafted and interesting), its action (on par with other action movies in 2003) and its cast -- especially Selene (Beckinsale) and Viktor (Nighy)Overall, the movie takes a new look at classic werewolf/ vampire tales and weaves the legends of both creatures together. It's a film I would recommend to anyone interested in watching a fast-paced action movie that has a lot more intelligence than say a ""XXX"" or other canned action flick. That said, you do need to have at least a passing interest in the supernatural in order to really enjoy the movie fully.And for those of you who have seen the film, the best news is that a sequel, already well set-up by the movie's ending, is already in the works",Underworld

The original matrix was innovative and thought provoking this movie is a wannabe .The characters were one dimensional and unlikeable. The development of the characters seemed silly and contrived.This is another example of Hollywood abandoning logic, reason, storytelling, plot, and good characters, in exchange for big guns explosions, and special effects, special effects, special, effects.If you are a fan of; The Fast and the Furious, The Blade movies, and Tomb Raider.

670,lordoftheguitar,A film of great magnitude,8,13 October 2005,"Recently, this week, I have watched Underworld twice.I admit the first time I watched it, I was a tad confused, especially with the first half, but as soon as you see the end it all makes perfect sense. Upon watching a second time I realised how good the film actually is (I did realise this before don't get me wrong). The film has what some people would call rusty acting, but if you listen , it is not actually rusty, just people with different accents from all over the world, showing the extreme power of the Vampire and Lycan covens, and how they have obviously travelled all over this globe. The best thing about the film though (SPOILER) is that you follow the paths of the Vampires all the way through the film, as the people who are out to do good, destroying this evil race that hunts them down also. And then two thirds of the way through there is a major twist and the whole film turns around so that you actually realise that the Vampires are the ones who started this war, and the bloodshed, and it was the Lycans who were under attack, after being kept as slaves. I think that in itself is a great power to do in a film. It is the same as watching the Matrix trilogy, then realising half way through, or in the last film, the the computers are the good guys and Neo and his friends are the evil ones... A great twist, backed up by fantastic effects and a passionate storyline. This film gets my vote.",Underworld

I'm i bit freak when it comes with a vampire movies (love old classic ones with Cristopher Lee as Dracula)-but as far as it goes-the movie has to have a good acting and good music to make it work. Well Underworld has it all. It has a great story (wich is very rear in the vampire movies). And Kate looks hot in it. Underworld is not a typical vampire movie we all now about: its different from other movies beacose it takes place in modern times, where are guns present in the battle. What surprise me is the style of the movie and the actors.They are drinking blood from glasses in ""civil"" way and they have modern cars like ""porche"" and all that. The movie is so fun too watch beacose there use real masks when it comes to werewolfs and not any computer effect-especially fighting sequence looks so real.

Whatever bright ideas were in the minds of the makes, it does create anything new or special on screen. Hey, let's put together some elements of matrix and blade, make just about everyone wear tight black leather, and mix together vampires, werewolves, obligatory romance, digital effects and call that a film. This one is simple the lamest film I've seen this year. Kate Beckinsale is like female Keanu Reeves - without colour, smell or taste. Seriously - what is it with being a vampire, un-nature's own Gothic killing machine and a little helpless girl at the same time. Maybe those two elements can be put together, but now it's just one indifferent mess, like 99% of the film. The romance between the main characters is unreal... maybe it's supposed to be so, with the undead and all.
