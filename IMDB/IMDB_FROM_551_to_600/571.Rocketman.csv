0,TheLittleSongbird,Dazzling rocket,8,2 December 2019,"Although classical music and opera is more my cup of tea/forte, that has never stopped me from having always admired Elton John and loving most of his songs. ""Your Song"", ""Something About the Way You Look Tonight"", ""I'm Still Standing"" and pretty much all the songs in 'The Lion King' are especially great, one of the few exceptions being ""Crocodile Rock"". He is/was also a quite interesting man, both stage persona and personal life, and the period that is primarily focused on is a very compelling one and worthy of being told on film.'Rocketman' was not a perfect film, but on the most part it was thoroughly enjoyable and at its best dazzlingly executed when seeing it in the cinema earlier this year. As far as films released in 2019 goes, 'Rocketman' is to me in the better half. Even if accuracy and the chronology can be called into question, it still makes John and his personal life, detailing his childhood, early career and how it came to be and the troubled period of his career, quite fascinating. As well as being worthy of a lot of admiration in its own right.Not everything works. For my liking, the last twenty minutes or so are executed too tidily.While John and Bernie Taupin are well rounded and fully realised characters, the other characters, despite being well acted by particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, felt like underdeveloped caricatures (i.e. the parents' cold behaviour towards Reggie not being explained).However, 'Rocketman' has so many things working in its favour and more so than the bad. First and foremost, Taron Egerton. A totally committed and quite brilliant performance full of confidence, swagger, flair, subtlety and nuance, not to mention a great singing voice, treating John with respect without impersonating him. The scene where he opens up to his mother and his reaction to her cold response was heart-breaking in particular. Jamie Bell is the other performance worthy of note and the relationship between John and Taupin is handled beautifully, with the right amount of intensity but also taste. One can tell how well they clicked and feel their mutual affection and it really drives the film and at times the heart of it.It looks great too, beautifully photographed and John's flamboyant costumes are a sight to behold, one of the bigger examples being that unlike-anything-you've-seen-before one in the therapy. The songs are as magnificent as one expects and staged with a lot of brio and confidence without being overblown. The very moving ""Your Song"", performance and the understated staging, being a big standout in this regard, another powerful part being with what is done with the opening of ""Yellow Brick Road"", done so truthfully and mirroring what is going on at that present moment without spelling it out too much and showing how much Taupin cares for John. Heck, the film even manages to make ""Crocodile Rock"" tolerable in one of the film's more exuberant moments.The script manages to be both entertaining and sincere, underneath all the flashiness there is depth too. There may be conventional moments in the story (a lot of biopics though are like that), but the scenes showing off John's unique showmanship are difficult to look away from and the story detailing John's troubled personal life at the time is powerful. A great job is done showing who John is, what he is and how his mind worked when dealing with troubles and when he was writing and performing. Dexter Fletcher's direction is adept.Summing up, a very, very good and often great film that just misses out on being brilliant. 8/10",Rocketman
1,bkoganbing,Legend of rock and roll,7,2 September 2019,"I do think an appropriate end for this musical fantasy biography of Elton John would have been him singing Goodbye English Rose at the funeral of Princess
Diana. It's where the world really got acquainted, a considerable more audience
than who usually go to concerts ad buy his records/CDs. I think Elton John as a
performer was truly the voice of his country expressing their grief.Saying that I did enjoy the film with Taron Edgerton playing the legendary
rock performer. It was quite the transformation from this gay shy nerdy English
kid who was studying to be a classical pianist who decides rock and roll is a
better method of expression.We see him going through the usual problems celebrities have, the bigger the
celeb, the bigger the entourage and it's tough to separate those who knew you
when and those who are hanging on and around.The film interestingly enough I think Rocketman bears comparison to is the
musical biography Cole which starred Kevin Kline as Cole Porter. Different type and era of music portrayed. But the film is structured the same way in
the way the numbers are done.Fans of Elton John will not be disappointed.",Rocketman
2,Leofwine_draca,Energetic musical biopic,6,6 April 2020,"ROCKETMAN is the latest British musical biopic, following hot on the heels of BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. This time around it's the life story of Elton John, following his life from a musically-gifted lad to his time in a band and finally his own breakout success. Although it's a story tinged with sadness and packed with drama, this film takes a light approach, focusing mainly on a series of lavishly-staged musical pieces which go on huge flights of fancy. It's cheesy but exuberant; while Taron Egerton looks nothing like the real-life John he can certainly sing well and there's plenty of energy to spare.",Rocketman
3,SnoopyStyle,Mamma Mia!,7,13 July 2019,"Elton John (Taron Egerton) is flamboyantly dressed as he walks into a group rehab session. He recounts his search for love, his life, his music, and his fame. His search for love starts with his cold parents. He finds a brother in song writing partner Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). In LA, he is taken with the dashing John Reid who eventually takes over his business as his manager. Reid turns out to be a ruthless taskmaster and a callous ex-lover. Elton's life spirals downwards until his drug use hits rock bottom.It's a surreal musical bio of pop icon Elton John. The central theme of finding love is a powerful one for him. In a way, this movie falls into a trap. Elton has so many great hits that it's too tempting to do a Mamma Mia!. They use the songs to project every turn of his life. It concentrates more as a musical. It could have been more powerful emotionally as a darker bio-film. It should be a movie of Elton and Bernie. Every time the movie has a chance of achieving emotional tension, it decides to do a song. While it worked well for the first half, it becomes somewhat tied down by its surrealist musical style. The best use of the songs seem to be Elton writing them or the crass producer rejecting Elton's biggest hits. That part is a bit funny. Egerton has the feel of a sad clown. I wonder if Jamie Bell would work better as Elton. The movie does achieve an emotional punch in the end and that's a great moment. I do like this movie but I also question whether a more compelling telling is possible.",Rocketman
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Not as explosive as I hoped it could be, but no misfire either",6,8 September 2019,"""Rocketman"" is an American/British co-production from 2019 and this one was directed by BAFTA-nominated filmmaker Dexter Fletcher, normally a prolific actor, while the script is by Oscar-nominated writer Lee Hall. The latter got his Academy Award nomination for the movie Billy Elliot and maybe it is no coincidence that in this one here we also have Jamie Bell play a central character. Pretty amazing to see how he has grown up. Anyway, the title already gives away that this film is about Elton John and from what I have seen and read he was apparently not too unhappy with how these pretty much exactly two hours turned out in the end. Now I am still hesitant to call this a biopic because really it only focuses on his rise to stardom and also his first years when he was a huge star and also how he struggled with addiction during that time. In the closing credits we see a more recent photo that shows us how he has not relapsed for decades (except when it comes to his shopping addiction). So there is for example no stuff like his Lion King works included in this movie, which I found a bit of a pity, but it is alright. Same for his Lady Di tribute, perhaps the biggest moment in his career as really the whole world was watching there. I guess this time was really not just suitable drama-wise to make a movie about or include it as a key part of the film.They still did fine with the path they took. They certainly succeeded in depicting Elton John as the spectacular figure he was, still is today in his early 70s now. The attention to detail in the script is nice as well telling us for example how he came up with his pseudonym and many other things too. Or how he reads these beauty/fashion magazines early on shows us also what direction he was heading in terms of style and maybe even sexual orientation. As for sexual orientation I don't think iI liked d the phone booth scene as much as I wanted to when he has his coming-out to his mother, even if it was not poorly-written. Okay the addiction group early on did feel slightly strange how they use his narration there to elaborate on what happened earlier in his life, but it wasn't failure territory either.But the key is of course the music. Many good songs included here and I even found one or two new ones from him that I liked and did not know before watching the film such as I Want Love. I am not a big fan of the man's music honestly, but I don't mind him either. There's some songs that are just impossible not to groove along with once you hear them. The best example is ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" and I also really liked the sequence they used it for, even if it was not a truly special moment at least not right there, but it worked well and actually it was even really special slightly afterwards when he spoke exactly about what was on his mind to his mother and her longtime boyfriend when they ask him for money again. Yes, there is major focus on his family. This scene was pretty memorable and it also made really clear how to see his mother, who did not necessarily feel like a real antagonist before that, even if I am sure many already saw her like that immediately. But it is good. I liked how they used a lot of shades in here. Felt executed with precision. She does not mind him being gay, but she executes pressure on him and makes him feel bad saying he will never find a loving relationship like this.The opposite is true about the loving relationship between him and his grandmother. Or the complicated relationship between him and his father. When he sees the man years later again with his new family, it is maybe the best, but also most heartbreaking scene of the movie as it almost feels sadistic how he asks his son for an autograph because really he means nothing to him. Heavy stuff really. But these were the moments when I wondered if I should maybe give it a higher rating because there it was a great movie, not just a good one. Sadly there were only one or two other like these, so all in all not enough for this running time. I mean there were no weaknesses and the film felt shorter than it actually was which is always a good sign. His professional struggles when it came to collaborating with his straight friend as well as the romantic relationship or I should say ""romantic"" that really holds him back and pulls him to the ground because he clearly loves the man more than the other way around as we see because there is not just physical violence but also a great deal of emotional abuse. Basically Elton John is nothing but a cash cow to him.There was also not really a solution and that is okay too. E.J. found his path, but that does not mean all the evil ghosts from his past have vanished and that is how life really is. So well done again. Negative criticisms? Well they could have included more of the song Rocketman I'd say. Sure the moment when he jumps into that pool with the intention to commit suicide and how we hear it goes well together with what he sees at the bottom of the pool, but this and I think (if at all) another brief inclusion of the melody early on did not feel enough if they use the name in the title even. Overall, this is a good movie. Egerton I was not too familiar with before, but he did a pretty good job here and carries the film nicely, of course with great help of the costume department. Funny that singing an Elton John song in the animated movie Sing probably helped him getting this role. Can he get in at the Oscars? Maybe not, Egerton probably won't, but he has a shot at the Globes I guess. We'll see.I was particularly curious about this movie as it had some people working on it that also were part of the Bohemian Rhapsody crew last year and I totally adored that movie honestly, but how could I not as a Queen fan. Critics I think many like this one more, but I would totally disagree. Malek's performance, the music etc. turn that one into a must-see, also for those who do not care (yet) about Queen. After that movie they will. On the other hand I don't really think this one will turn you into an Elton John fan honestly, but like I said it is still pretty decent overall and there are no glaring weaknesses, so unless you really dislike the man this is about (hello Madonna (fans)), you can give it ago and probably you will not be disappointed. Still, you should not expect greatness or so. I give it a solid thumbs-up.",Rocketman
5,Prismark10,The circle of life,6,9 August 2019,"Following hot on the heels of Bohemian Rhapsody. Comparisons are inevitable especially as Dexter Fletcher, the director of Rocketman was brought in to finish Bo Rap. Both films also feature the character of John Reid as business manager for both Queen and Elton John.The film is framed with a rock bottom Elton John (Taron Egerton) wearing a heavy costume going into rehab for his various addictions and talking about all the issues in his life.Reg Dwight was a child prodigy on the piano. His life changed when he met Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) and Elton put music to Bernie's lyrics.In the 1970s came big success and battle with his demons. From 1975 Elton admits to being a twonk to his friends and family as he got addicted to booze and drugs. A year later his homosexuality became public.The framing device works well. Elton felt a lack of love from his parents especially from his distant father. When Elton found success, he found his business manager and lover John Reid more interested in Elton's career than providing him with love and affection.The songs weave around the film and sung by the cast. It seems the writer Lee Hall took the songs and built the structure of the film around the lyrics, you could easily guess what the final song was going to be.Like Bo Rhap it is not chronologically accurate. Elton John married Renate in 1984 when the film reaches its natural end in 1983.I did feel Rocketman was lightweight even when it goes into Elton's darkest aspects of his life, it just seemed too tinged with sweetness. A surprise because Elton John has never shied away from talking about his dark days so it could never had been a contractual thing.Egerton does well as Elton but it is a performance that never blew me away. Bryce Dallas Howard surprised me with her English accent as Elton's mother.Like a lot of other recent films based on true events. The film wants to blow its own trumpet by showing how much detailed they have gone to recreate the sets and costumes. Then you realise what was the point? Part of the story has been fictionalized for narrative purposes. I liked it much more with some nice humorous bits such as when John Reid strokes Elton's receding hair and some of it falls off on his hands.I saw Elton John in concert some years ago. His core band have been with him for decades, half are from Britain and the other half are from the USA. I would liked to have seen how they reacted to Elton John when he was loaded on drugs, did they try to wean him off or just joined him. The film does not tell you.",Rocketman
6,claudio_carvalho,Emotionless,6,3 September 2019,"Elton John is one of the greatest contemporary artists of the world, no doubt. However, this highlight of his life is a terrible overrated film, without any emotion and an exploitation of Elton John as a needy alcoholic and drug addicted gay. He is needy because of his one-dimension parents that are never developed and the viewer never knows why they treat the boy that way. His gay side is also poorly developed and more exploited. In the end, the film is lost between a shallow drama and a boring musical. The performance of Taron Egerton in the role of Elton John is the best this movie can offer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Rocketman""",Rocketman
7,nogodnomasters,I'm still standing,7,20 June 2019,"This is a musical biopic of Elton John (Taron Egerton) musical child genius. The film is told as a flashback as an overly dressed Elton John shows up at an AA meeting and tells us his story. It included musical numbers worked into his biography as well as an overuse of flash mobs.Taron Egerton plays a leaner and less nerdy Elton John. He also does his own singing which was dreadful during the high notes and passable else wise. And OMG... it is ""tiny dancer"" and not ""Tony Danza.""And BTW, you really don't need to ""come out."" Most folks know you were gay before you did...Pete.Guide: F-word. MM sex (no surprise there). No nudity",Rocketman
8,kosmasp,Elton Way,7,20 July 2019,"First things first: this is close to a musical, with people starting to sing and dance (though Elton John is doing most of the singing of course). Now that is important because some people will cherish that fact and others will be annoyed to say the least.This is a different kind of musical biography ... you can't even begin to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody. While there were some who didn't like the fact that the other movie went out of its way to interpret things and be free with the truth, this movie is pretty straightforward, that it does not play in the normal world, but yes a heightened feeling to it from the beginning. That doesn't mean, that certain things did not happen, it is just exaggerated. The main performance is great, though the Queen movie seems to have more powerful songs - of course Rocketman and other songs are great too and you may feel different about that sentiment anyway. Not an easy watch, especially considering the sexuality of Elton and some of the depictions - this also focuses on a certain time period. All that just fyi",Rocketman
9,classicsoncall,"""Just put on a great f..... show, and just don't kill yourself with drugs.""",9,8 November 2019,"For whatever reason, I didn't catch this in theaters during it's opening run the way I did for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". I think I liked this one slightly better, even though I'm not that much a fan of movie musicals. The way this story was presented was cleverly and artistically well put together, though if put into perspective, many of Elton John's mega-hits seemed to have been written well before he made his American debut at The Troubador at the age of twenty five. I never followed Elton's personal life that closely, but that all seemed to be poetic license for the sake of a narrative flow. Taron Egerton did a bang up job here, not only looking like Elton John on the way to super-star status, but sounded quite a bit like him as well. Given that Elton John himself gave Egerton and the film his blessing is all anyone needs to know about the underlying substance to the story. It's a shame that Reginald Dwight's parents never really cared for him, but then you have to consider how much that sadness translated into the singer's overall success. What the film put to rest for me was Elton's relationship with song writer Bernie Taupin, as I never really knew if Taupin was anything more than a collaborator rather than a musician himself. Additionally, as I watch all my films now with captioning enabled, I was surprised to learn how much of John's popular lyrics I never really knew. So overall, this was an entertaining experience, and one I'd welcome viewing again. The surprising thing is, it's actually shorter than one of Elton John's concerts. The man can do three hours without a break, always giving fans more than their money's worth.",Rocketman
10,lee_eisenberg,there's a lot to know about those to whom we look up,7,8 June 2020,"I first learned of Elton John when he won an Oscar for his song from ""The Lion King"" (a movie that I've still never seen). I later heard about him when he wrote a song for Princess Diana's funeral, and from there learned about the rest of his career.So, it was inevitable that there would be a biopic. I didn't expect a musical biopic, but it probably made sense to make it a musical. After the movie won an Oscar for Best Original Song, I figured that I might as well see it. The movie shows John in all his facets: genius, drug addict, and all-around flasher (it was the '70s, so how could he not be such?). I should admit that I've never paid much attention to John's work; nothing against him, just not my style.The movie starts with John's childhood (and an emotionally distant father) and goes through the years, showing John producing some notable songs while leading a typically '70s life and eventually coming out as gay. It's no masterpiece - especially since they had to take some creative liberties for storytelling's sake - but there's a lot of impressive stuff in store here. Whatever you think of Elton John, there's no denying his impact on popular culture over the past half-century.All in all, I recommend the movie.",Rocketman
11,jboothmillard,Rocketman,6,3 June 2019,"A year after his 70th birthday, in 2018, Sir Elton John announced he was retiring, with a three-year farewell tour; since the announcement, he has made TV appearances, including some documentaries, and the John Lewis & Partners Christmas advert. Well, now finally we get the biographical musical movie telling the story of his rise to fame, only half a year after the successful Bohemian Rhapsody, about Freddie Mercury, and Queen, produced by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, Kingsman: The Secret Service), and David Furnish, Elton's husband, directed by Dexter Fletcher (Sunshine on Leith, Eddie the Eagle). Basically as a child, Reginald 'Reggie' Dwight (Matthew Illesley, and Kit Connor) is raised by his cold mother Sheila (Bryce Dallas Howard) and more caring grandmother Ivy (Gemma Jones), while his father Stanley (Steven Mackintosh) is away doing his service in the Royal Air Force. Reggie shows interest in playing the piano, and soon begins studying at the Royal Academy of Music. Stanley, who has never showed any love towards Reggie, abandons his family after Sheila has an affair with another man. Reggie has an interest in rock music, especially Elvis Presley, and starts performing in local pubs before becoming a backing artist for a band, Bluesology. As an adult, Reggie (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Taron Egerton) changes his name to Elton John and tries to find success with a publishing company, with producer Dick James (Stephen Graham), managed by Ray Williams (Charlie Rowe). Elton is given a bunch of lyric sheets from new lyricists, and he has a meeting with songwriter Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell). The two quickly form a friendship, and they agree to work together to create songs, Taupin writing, and Elton adding the music, Taupin also accepts Elton's homosexuality. In 1970, James is impressed with the song ""Your Song"" and organises a performance for them at Troubadour in Los Angeles, the audience love Elton's performance. At a party afterwards, Elton feels abandoned when Taupin leaves to be with a woman, he is then approached by music manager John Reid (Richard Madden), who is attracted to him. The two sleep together and reunite later, Reid influences Elton into many things, including excessive indulgence. Elton's career takes off, he becomes a highly successful musician, and embraces a flamboyant stage persona. Reid is appointed Elton's new manager but manipulates him and insists that he comes out as gay to his parents so they can help hide their sexual relationship from the press. Sheila bluntly says she already knew about his sexuality and doesn't care, and that he faces a life of being alone forever. Elton decides not to tell Stanley, as he has made a new life with his new family and seems to have left behind his old one. Elton struggles with the situation between his mother and father, and the abuse of Reid, he becomes addicted to alcohol, cocaine, and sex. At a house party, he consumes a dangerous amount of drugs and alcohol, he attempts suicide by drowning in his swimming pool. Elton is rushed to hospital and not long after is forced back on stage to continue performing. Elton falls out with both his mother and Taupin, feeling angry he overdoses on prescription drugs and alcohol, which causes a heart attack, sending him to hospital again. Reid hears the news but shuns it and forces him back on stage, Elton realises his life is spiralling out of control, he leaves before a performance and seeks help. Elton enters rehabilitation and accepts that he can live a life without reverting to his parents or Reid, he repairs his friendship with Taupin and returns to performing. Today, Elton John has been sober for nearly thirty years, Taupin continues to be his friend and collaborator, and Elton found love with husband, David Furnish, with whom he has two children. Also starring Tate Donovan as Doug Weston, Tom Bennett as Fred, Sharon D. Clarke as Counsellor, Rachel Muldoon as Kiki Dee, Star Wars' Jimmy Vee as Arthur and Leigh Francis as Pete. Featuring the songs ""The B**** Is Back"", ""I Want Love"", ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting"", ""Crocodile Rock"", ""Tiny Dancer"", ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"", ""Honky Cat"", ""Pinball Wizard"", ""Rocket Man"" (the title song), ""Bennie and the Jets"", ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"", ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" and ""I'm Still Standing"", and many more. Egerton gives a terrific performance, being brash, flamboyant and vulnerable, and he does pretty well singing as well, Bell is also good as John's long-time friend and professional partner Taupin, Howard is almost unrecognisable with her black wig and English accent, and the other cast members do well also. This is a clever way to tell the story of one of the world's most famous singers, as an extravagant fantasy of sorts, the song and dance sequences play out in the narrative to drive it forward, John himself said he didn't want the gritty stuff dumbed down, so it does get dark at times, but for the colourful costumes, inventive editing, and of course the great music, it is a worthwhile musical biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""I'm Gonna Love Me Again"" by Sir Elton John and Bernie Taupin (also won the Golden Globe), it was nominated the BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film of the Year, and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Sir Elton John was number 55 on The 100 Worst Britons, he was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 on The Ultimate Pop Star. Good!",Rocketman
12,dbdumonteil,These are your songs.,8,14 June 2020,"Very good biopic , with a stunning performance by Taron Egerton :the most successful artist of the first half of the seventies really comes alive ;many songs are included and it is a well-chose menu : they fit into the action quite well ,particularly ""tiny dancer"" and the title song ,perhaps the highlight of the whole movie .
Jamie Bell gives strong support as Bernie Taupin and he has the most moving line of the script ""yes I love you ,Elton,but not that way!""He's the sensible guy who hardly knows his good friend in his extravaganzas, his flashy costumes ,and he's the one who saved his life ,not only tonight as Elton sang in 1975 ,but later,when he made his descent into Hell.

13,blanche-2,wonderful musical biography of a great composer and performer,9,9 November 2020,"""Rocketman"" tells the story of Elton John - it's not an actual biography, though. It's told in the fantasy setting of a music, using many of his fabulous songs.The timing of events is often inaccurate, songs are used at times before they were written. the story has inaccuracies, but who cares - it's not meant to be accurate, it's meant to be fun. And it is.Elton tells his story while in rehab, about his cold father, his relationship with his mom and nana, his beginnings playing piano and composing, meeting Bernie Taupin, stardom, lovers, and addictions. One thing not emphasized - Elton supposedly had a warm relationship with his mom's second husband, Fred, whom he called ""Derf"" - but you really don't get that impression in the film.Taron Edgerton sings like a dream and makes a terrific Elton. What can I say about the music? I loved every note.Elton John is a brilliant musician. a flamboyant performer, a humanitarian, and an interesting personality. Even if you don't get his entire story from ""Rocketman,"" you certainly realize that.",Rocketman
14,tavm,Rocketman was a fine musical version of Elton John's life and career,10,18 June 2019,"After finishing the Freddie Mercury and Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, director Dexter Fletcher then made this musical biopic of Elton John played here by Taron Egerton. And this is very much a musical as not only does Taron sing the famous songs written by Elton and Bernie Taupin but so do the other real-life figures in his life as if characters in a Broadway or movie musical. It's mostly a joyous celebration until John's drug and alcohol fueled excess takes its toll. But he recovered in a big way leading to...well, just watch Rocketman. It's that good!",Rocketman
15,preppy-3,Great musical,10,10 June 2019,"Musical that chronicles the life and times of Elton John (Taron Egerton). It also gets into his relationships with his best friend (Jamie Bell) and manager (Richard Madden). It's sort of an average biographical film but then people start singing and dancing out of nowhere. It's strange at first but I got into it completely. It's never boring and all the singing and dancing is great. Naturally they do only Elton John songs. Also they don't ignore the fact that John is gay. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" barely deals with Freddie Mercury being gay but this one (thankfully) shoves it in your face. There's a fairly explicit gay sex scene which is a first for a major Hollywood film.The acting is great. Egerton is just great and his singing sounds just like John. Bell is equally good as his best friend. Madden looks terrible and is just OK as his manager. All in all it's a strange film and not for everybody--two people walked out when I saw it--but I loved it and was fascinated. A 10 all the way.",Rocketman
16,CinemaSerf,Reg (almost) Strikes Back.,7,24 November 2019,"I enjoyed this, but somehow felt a little underwhelmed! There is something tame about Taron Egerton's performance. Sir Elton has never been shy in admitting to the excesses of his pursuit of happiness in the 70's - perhaps there was a reluctance to have this rated 18 (R) so much of that was left to our imagination? Jamie Bell, Richard Madden and Charlie Rowe make creditable contributions but it still lacks punch! Maybe, so soon after ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" it just doesn't quite have the rawness and/or edginess? The soundtrack - provided by Egerton, himself, is the stuff of legend, though and all-in-all it is still a most enjoyable watch.",Rocketman
17,zardoz-13,His Song!!!,8,23 June 2019,"Taron Egerton delivers an electrifying performance as Elton John in ""Eddie the Eagle"" director Dexter Fletcher's ""Rocketman,"" a 'warts and all' musical biography about the British singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer who has sold reportedly as many as 250 to 300 million records since his debut on the charts in 1970 with ""Your Song."" Mind you, Elton's debut studio album hit the racks in 1969, but it wasn't released in the U.S. until 1975. Occasionally inspired, often conventionally straightforward, but hopelessly costumed, this cinematic greatest hits revue epitomizes the proverb 'money cannot buy happiness.' This hoary cliché finds refreshing relevance with the eponymous musician's own confession early on in writer Lee Hall's screenplay. Elton boasts that he has done everything, but he has never experienced true love. Now, if you're wondering what he felt about this off-delayed, somewhat contrived jukebox musical fantasy, it should come as no surprise that the five-time Grammy winning piano prodigy adores it. Indeed, Elton produced this two-hour plus extravaganza, with his husband, Canadian filmmaker David Furnish.Elton's biopic qualifies as an important first in movie history for its depiction of gay male sex. Essentially, however, most of these flagrant affections amount to little more than kissing and groping. Sadly, despite the musician's participation behind the camera, ""Rocketman"" has yet to achieve the lunar trajectory of Queen's comparatively prudish PG-13 release ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018), with its phenomenal $900 million plus box office haul. Reportedly, audiences criticized ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" for sterilizing Freddy Mercury's love life. After watching this rise and fall and then phoenix-like rebirth of the British superstar's life, it seems miraculous that Elton has emerged from the pandemonium of his life and appears now to be at peace at age 72. Elton's second autobiography due out in print October 15th will undoubtedly prove more illuminating.Watching ""Rocketman"" is like watching Elton's greatest hits. The first time we see the superstar, he storms into a twelve-step AA meeting, presumably fresh from a concert, decked out as he is like the supernatural monster ""Hellboy"" from the Dark Horse Comics. Detaching the horns from his headpiece, Elton collapses into a chair and regales them with his woes. ""Rocketman"" chronicles Elton's rollercoaster life, including his bouts with his eating disorders, shopping sprees, and alcohol-fueled orgies energized with prescription meds as well as illegal substances. At one point, as he is topping the charts, Elton realizes he must hush up his secret life as a homosexual. When he outs himself on a pay phone to his serenely aloof mother, Shelia (Bryce Dallas Howard of ""Jurassic World""), she smirks: ""Oh, for God's sake, I knew that. I've known for years."" Like Queen's front man Freddie Mercury, Elton survives a harrowing same sex encounter with a villainous manager, John Reid (Richard Madden of Disney's live-action ""Cinderella""), who warns Elton--whether the latter lives or dies-that he will still reap his 20 percent of the profits. Perhaps a message lurks within for prospective rockers about confusing love with sex. Incidentally, a different actor played the same promoter in ""Bohemian Rhapsody.""Naturally, ""Rocketman"" eavesdrops on Elton's early years in flashback when he was shy Reginald Kenneth Dwight and discovered an affinity for the piano at age four. By age eleven, he had landed a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. Clearly, Elton suffered at the whims of his parents who withheld their love and affection. No, they didn't abuse him physically, but the emotional toll was just as devastating to the youngster. The first genuine friendship that he forged turned out to be with his long-time musical collaborator but heterosexual male, Bernie Taupin ( Jamie Bell of ""Defiance""), who penned some of Elton's best lyrics. Apart from a brief hiatus between 1977 to 1979, Elton and Taupin spent more than 30 years together writing songs. Elton boasts that they had only one argument during all those years!Unlike most celebrities who shun the spotlight when it threatens to become too revealing, Elton John told director Dexter Fletcher that he wanted to see as much 'honesty' as possible about his trials and tribulations. At no time did the rock star admonish Fletcher and Hall about unsavory episodes in his life. Predictably, the sexual improprieties have been held to a minimum, but Elton's faithful heterosexual fans have probably resigned themselves to this revelation in a career that has been splashed across the tabloids for almost fifty years. The inevitable turning point in any rock star's life occurs when suicide rears its ugly head in their thoughts. One of ""Rocketman's"" insightful scenes takes place during such an instance. During a pool-party orgy with scores of oblivious spectators carrying on without a clue, a bleakly depressed Elton plunges headlong into the surreal blue depths and sinks like a rock. At the bottom of his pool, he finds young Reginald Kenneth Dwight playing his tiny piano. Mind-blowing accurately describes this unforgettable scene.""Rocketman"" doesn't cover the entirety of Elton's life. Ostensibly, the last of his greatest hits ""I'm Still Standing"" marks not only the conclusion of the film but also the end of a life over 'troubled waters' as he comes to grips with his homosexuality, terminates his heterosexual marriage after two years, and emerges from rehab with a new lease on life. Of course, purists will argue that Fletcher and company have tampered with the chronology of Elton's life. Of course, they have! Nevertheless, they have tried to make his life as sensational as it is tall-all, while eliminating other events which did not contribute to the film. Taron Egerton's vocal performance as well as his bizarre wardrobe changes closely imitate Elton. Altogether, ""Rocketman"" qualifies as a blast!",Rocketman
18,grantss,Bland,5,6 March 2020,"The life of music legend Elton John.Underwhelming. I did not set my expectations very high and even then was disappointed. When this was released I figured it was an attempt to cash in on the success of Bohemian Rhapsody and make a biopic about a 1970s rock star. This despite growing up in the 70s and liking the music of Elton John. I thought Bohemian Rhapsody was excellent but just from the trailers Rocketman didn't seem to have anywhere near the same energy, profundity and solid storytelling.And the trailer was pretty much spot-on. Rocketman is a linear telling of Elton John's life...and that's it. Director Dexter Fletcher turns it into a semi-musical but that just makes it worse. Like most musicals, song-and-dance numbers being jammed into the middle of a scene makes for jarring, clumsy storytelling and this is no different. It might have been okay if they had used the original music but instead we have actor Taron Edgerton singing the songs, and he just doesn't sound right.There's never any spark that makes the movie interesting, Some scenes are downright clumsy: the scene that runs through the movie of John at an AA meeting seems pretty implausible and contrived and merely there as a means for John to tell his life story.On the positive side, performances are very good. Despite his singing, Edgerton is great as Elton John and Jamie Bell puts in a solid performance as Bernie Taupin.",Rocketman
19,neil-476,A lot better than I expected,8,26 May 2019,"Reg Dwight combats some childhood issues and destructive addictions on his way to stardom and beyond.Taron Egerton makes a good pass at Elton Hercules John in this fanciful (and, perhaps, rather selective) trawl through Elt's history.I'll come clean - I'm not an Elton John fan, although I'm au fait with his best-known material and much of his public history. But I don't like his vocal mannerisms, and I don't much care for the public personae he has displayed over the years. But, hey, this is a movie and, even when it's supposed to be fact, it's fiction.And it's good. It tells its story well, the performances are all good (dear heavens, that was Bryce Dallas Howard? I thought I recognised her, but blimey!), and the musical sequences are well-chosen and well-realised.Was I emotional. Well, no. At least, not until the reaffirmation of a singularly important relationship towards the end of the movie. Yes, that got me.All we need now is The George Michael Story and we'll have a boxset!",Rocketman
20,ferguson-6,trippy musical biopic,8,30 May 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's billed as a musical fantasy. If you are familiar with Elton John's discography and history, you'll want to keep that in mind as the film unfolds. The reward is a colorful spectacle worthy of one of pop music's most successful songwriters and greatest showmen. Director Dexter Fletcher (EDDIE THE EAGLE, 2015) and writer Lee Hall (BILLY ELLIOT, 2000) make frequent use of Elton's music within the fabric of the storytelling. It's no traditional biopic, nor should it be, given the wild ride of the man whose story is being told.Taron Egerton tears into playing Elton John like it's the role of a lifetime. And he succeeds in a way that makes it seem that could be true. Most of us first recognized Taron's talent as ""Eggsy"" in KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE (2014), though I'm not sure we expected such a dynamic step up so soon. This is not some actor merely mimicking the movements of a celebrity. This is an actor taking possession of a role. Without the costumes, Taron doesn't look much like Elton John. He certainly doesn't sound like Elton John ... though his voice does justice to the classic songs. Despite those things, he is captivating on screen, both in the dramatic moments and the musical mania.Elton's childhood and the strained relationship he had with his parents (played here by Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Macintosh) are given much attention, as is the support and love of his grandmother (Gemma Jones). With two self-centered parents wishing he didn't exist, the child piano prodigy might never have attended the Royal Academy of Music if not for grandmother Ivy. Of course, the professional relationship that meant the most to Elton's career was his songwriting collaboration with lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), and much of the film is devoted to this prolific partnership - in fact, one of the most spine-tingling moments occurs as Bernie hands Elton the words to ""Your Song"" and Elton proceeds to set it to music right in front of us and Bernie. Whether that's historically accurate or not, it provides a thrilling moment on screen for the creative duo.Elton John in rehab is used as a framing device for the film. This allows him to walk us through his life ... after admitting to having issues with drugs, alcohol, sex, shopping and anger. In other words, one of the most successful musicians of all time was a mess. And we get to sit front row as he details his early sexual confusion, his desire to be loved, his early professional frustration, and finally a career that exploded - covering him with money, adoration, stress, and more frustration. We see the warts and all.Supporting roles are filled by Richard Madden as John Reid, Elton's lover and manager; Tate Donovan as Doug Weston, owner of Sunset Blvd's Troubadour; Rachel Muldoon as Kiki Dee, Elton's collaborator on their big hit ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart""; and Stephen Graham as Dick James, the famous music publisher who first signed Elton.As someone whose favorite Elton albums are ""Tumbleweed Connection"", ""Madman Across the Water"", and ""Honky Chateau"", it's easy for me to appreciate the time period covered here (roughly 1970-1983), and also to recognize the 'artistic license' taken with the timelines and events. His 1970 gig at Troubadour features a rowdy version of ""Crocodile Rock"", which wasn't even written yet ... although the scene makes for great cinema. Many of the songs that advance the story are used out of sequence, but it's quite effective to see and hear them in context. His marriage to Renate Blauel and the rehab stint featured both occurred after 1983, which we can assume is the story's stopping point given the use of the ""I'm Still Standing"" video as a finale. Even the use of John Lennon over Long John Baldry doesn't really matter since this is all about the spectacle, and for spectacle, you've likely never seen costumes (including eyeglasses and headdresses) used to such startling effect ... and so frequently. The baseball ""uniform"" Elton wore during his 1975 Dodger Stadium gig has always made me a bit uncomfortable, but it's recreated beautifully for the film.Given that comparisons to the recent BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY are inevitable, it should be noted that director Dexter Fletcher rescued the final production of that film before finishing this one. Freddie Mercury and Elton John are two of the most fascinating figures in music history, and while both films are enjoyable, it's ROCKETMAN that is willing to take the riskier path by highlighting the flaws of a creative genius. So criticize if you must, but you'll probably still be singing in your seat.",Rocketman
21,phd_travel,Too much on the sad and bad,5,17 October 2019,The focus of this story had too much emphasis on the drugs and his breakdown. Since Elton himself was behind this don't understand why he didn't go on to show his sober days - The Lion King and friendship with Princess Diana and his happy marriage. The early part with his budding musical talent was actually quite good. Quite a lot of anger towards his parents here. Another grating thing is the sometimes Bollywood style musical numbers.Taron is a good actor - quite intense. Few actors actually look like Elton but if they made him fatter it would have helped.The Freddy Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody was a better movie.,Rocketman
22,trashgang,simply great,8,21 May 2020,"I grew up in a time that Elton John was making songs that were made to hate, Nikita en Candle in The Wind, that era. So growing older I opened my mind starting to listen were it all started and Crocodile Rock and Your Song passes by. Yep, he really is a legend. And so you start to appreciate the man.When this flick came out I thought there was nothing to say about Elton but was I wrong. In the flick, were he is starting to make the classic I did get a smile on my face to hear them again and by doing so you are dragged into the lyrics. And are they personal o they do.So at the end of the flick and espescially the end credits were all shots and costumes are explained throughout the flick I reallyy digged it all, and while I am writing this Elton John is playing in my headphones. Complicated man, sure, issues with his feelings, sure but never forget that Bernie and Reginald are Elton John. Great flick, great songs...

23,christopher-underwood,did those scenes of the AA meetings really have to go on throughout the whole movie,7,31 May 2019,"Not quite sure what I expected here. Despite pre-release assurances to the contrary was this going to be a saccharin heavy glory tale? Or maybe it really would be a warts and all transgressive tale of absolute excess? Inevitably, I guess, the result is something in the middle. The early minutes are appalling with dancing in the street and Elton as a small child but things improve and the meeting and early days with Bernie Taupin extremely good. It is the second quarter of the film as Elton struggles to establish himself as a performer and a person that are the best but sadly things then take a turn downwards, but just not darkly enough. There is far too much of Elton feeling sorry for himself and blaming everybody else while the soundtrack races on like some over excited tribute band. I have always like the man's voice but not much else and here, we do not even get to hear his voice. I'm sure some will love this but it would have to be someone steeped in his music from the beginning. Not much here for the neutral and did those scenes of the AA meetings really have to go on throughout the whole movie and so many scenes end with 'Its just a dream'!",Rocketman

With this big screen picture called ""Rocketman"" it tells the rise and break out of the stardom of one Elton John it's like the film also teases in a fantasy like way with parody that involves certain songs from John. Flashbacks and looking back at his life are the norm thru the film, as his life is heavily focused on. Looking all the way back at his childhood days you the viewer see that it was tough that Elton grew up without his real dad after the split from tough overbearing mommy Sheila(Bryce Dallas Howard) it was clear that Elton needed a father figure.At an early age this little shy boy took interest in piano and ""Elvis"" and would later sing and entertain for escape, and one by one this would mold him into a pop rock superstar! Still along the way this man like everyone else had high and low points from addiction with hard drugs and alcohol, plus he had to battle his inner demons and come to terms with his sexuality. I must also say that actor Taron Egerton was great as Elton he really hit all the high notes from the singing, acting, and he captured all of the man's emotions and brilliant madness of the fairy tale ride of life! Excellent wonderful work for certain go see this if you are an Elton John fan, as it shows how a pop legend came about thru struggles and pain, as this ""Rocketman"" is still standing!",Rocketman
25,DKosty123,Captain Fantastic Early Life Fantasy And Shallow Meanings,7,16 June 2020,"This film is thought of as a fantasy. That is close to what it is. It is thought of as a biography. No it is not. It is thought of as a musical. It's not really totally that. What it really is presented as is an artwork of Elton John on a frame as an artist, yet a tormented genius.It is not presented in perfect order. It starts with Elton John in rehab. That is the reason a straight factual biography of Elton John can never be done. Despite all the media attention much of his life has received, because of his alcohol and drug abuse even Elton John does not have the real picture of where he was or where he has been. That is the way it happens when you tune out parts of your life.A fair part of Elton John & Bernie Taupin's considerable song book is here. Not all of it, and a few tunes get just slightly mentioned. Sadly, the whole story of his music might better be told by telling the story through Bernie. A lot of the words and lyrics were his, and he would know the meaning of them. Elton John is just the singer and music maker of those words.Elton John is a flamboyant performer, and that is the story that is told here. It goes into the dark sides of his rise to success even more than the triumphs. It says that daddy and mommy were cold fish. It gives Grandma the credit starting his music success. It touches on Elton John's relationships in most ways though it very subtly touches on his exposure to Liberace who had to be an influence on his career. How much of this is the real story is left to guessing since some of it contradicts facts about this life that are out there.That's the way it should be too. Some of the real material can't be touched. For example the only mention of Candle In The Wind is a few bars of it played on the piano. A Biography would have to include the version written for Princess Diana's death and the inspiration behind that, as well as the inspiration behind the original written before she died.Well I think this one is an interesting fantasy the way it is done, I'd like to see Taupin done as a biography. While the performing is great, I believe the inspiration and writing behind the lyrics of Taupin's songs would be a more interesting story.The acting, music, direction, and the framing of a huge cast exploration of John's life is well done. But to me, the heart of the story is Bernie's lyrics and that is hardly even touched here.",Rocketman

27,sddavis63,A Gritty And Realistic Portrayal Of Elton's Early Life But A Bit Too Heavy On The Fantasy Bits,7,16 June 2019,"Given that Elton John was himself involved in the production of this film as one of the Executive Producers, I have to say that it's a courageous and at times painfully honest portrayal of Elton's early life. It pulls no punches, depicting the troubled home life he had as a young boy (and especially his troubled relationship with his father) along with his descent into booze, drugs and sex as his career took off, along with the abuse he endured in some of his early relationships. There's certainly nothing sugar coated. On the other hand, the movie portrays Elton as a prodigy, apparently destined for musical greatness from early in life. It seems a reasonable depiction of Elton's early life, set as a sort of rock opera at times, as everything is placed among various songs Elton is famous for. I thought the choreography was good, and Taron Egerton did a fantastic job of portraying Elton - surely no easy task when the man you're portraying is also the Executive Producer of the movie you're playing him in. So kudos to Egerton and to most of the rest of the cast who did a fine job and portrayed their characters believably.I thought, however, that the movie did go a little overboard in paying homage to Elton's music. At times this becomes little more than a musical with some dance routines thrown in for good measure. At times it's a bit of of fantasy, and perhaps because of that and because the movie tried so desperately to fit the story of Elton's life with Elton's music (it's a little bit like ""Mamma Mia"" in that respect except that the story is true) it at times seemed a bit disjointed. The most obvious recent comparison one might make for ""Rocketman"" would be ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" which told the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen, and also pulled few punches in offering us a glimpse into Mercury's life. On balance, I'd have to say that I preferred ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" which is a little surprising to me since I actually prefer Elton John's music to Queen's. But that movie flowed better and was markedly better paced than ""Rocketman.""But saying that I preferred ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is not the same as saying that I disliked ""Rocketman."" It's a very good movie - often enjoyable (if you're a fan of Elton John's music) and often quite heavy as the more troublesome aspects of Elton's life are portrayed. And it really is worth watching for Taron Egerton, who actually performed most of Elton's songs and did very well with them. And the movie does end on a high note, highlighting (through captions and pictures) Elton's life since he overcame his various demons and addictions. (7/10)",Rocketman

Hell, even the homophobic parent scenes wanted us to be in shock, but then never told us how to overcome it. Taron Egerton was amazing as were the visuals and songs, but overall it felt oh so hollow.

29,Robert_duder,A synopsis musical fantasy biography,8,2 June 2019,"I can see how some won't take to Rocketman well even if they are fans of Sir Elton John. It doesn't really follow the typical biographical film path. It's part fantasy, part bio-pic and really just small snippets of Elton John's life. It has his music dabbed throughout it and captures what I presume he feels are the major points in his life. It does a good job of capturing many of his relationships and inspirations too and gets the point across of some of his major trials and tribulations. Taren Egerton is brilliant. He gives an Oscar nominated worthy performance as Elton John. He completely embodies the role and disappears into it and some of the shots and profiles of him look eerily like a young Elton. And then on top of that to do his own singing it just fantastic. Jamie Bell is good as his life long writing partner Bernie. They have a definite chemistry on screen and the role is underplayed in a lot of ways but still emphasizes the importance of their brotherhood. His sexuality is handled blatantly but well including his relationships on that front as well. A brilliant lead performance, performances of iconic music, a flashy musical, it's a lot of fun and it's unique and definitely unlike anything else out there right now so well worth checking out but understand this is going for something a little more fantastical than just a biopic like Bohemian Rhapsody was. 8/10",Rocketman
30,Lejink,High Flying Bird,5,13 July 2019,"Elton John the recording artist played a big part in my teenage soundtrack years, encompassing his acknowledged classic period from 1971-1976 so the music from this fantasy bio-pic certainly hits the spot with me. I've also seen him in concert more than once and can testify that he's a dynamite live performer. This film acknowledges both of these things but also seeks to portray Elton the human being, the repressed young gay man, born of difficult parents who discovers he has an innate talent for playing the piano and writing melodies for songs. Once he hooks up with his ""brown dirt cowboy"" lyricist Bernie Taupin and after the two of them struggle for a few years as hack songwriters at the beck and call of old-fashioned impresario Dick James, Elton's alter ego, the flamboyant Captain Fantastic showman duly lands and makes him the biggest act in America covering those golden years.That success however came at a price as the lonely superstar, still struggling to come to terms with his sexuality and mind-blowing success, duly heads for the overload and binges out on drink, drugs and success. The film ends with the at last reformed John belting out his survival song ""I'm Still Standing"" and exorcising most of his demons although if you've ever seen the subsequent infamous ""fly-on-the-wall"" TV special ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" he's obviously still a spendthrift and subject to mood swings.No saint is our Elton then but it is possible to feel understanding and even sympathy for the poor little mega-rich boy portrayed here. Director Dexter Fletcher is undoubtedly on John's side as evidenced by the timespan selected here, but still the film and its portrayal of superstar excess seemed a bit shallow and obvious to me.I liked the over-the-top introduction to the movie as Elton in full regalia crashes an A.A. meeting, at which his confessions and recollections director Fletcher conveniently uses to tell his rise and fall. Never mind that the time-line is frequently skewered and liberties are taken with the detail, the film is principally out to showcase John's extensive musical library and certainly does this although with sometimes mixed results.Taron Egerton doesn't really look or sound a lot like Elton but he wholeheartedly throws himself into the part and just about carries it off. Richard Madden gets a fairly meaty part as John Reid, Elton's cold, controlling manager and for a time, lover, Jamie Bell is okay as Bernie Taupin, but none of his great band get named in the movie and neither is any credit given to the producer of all his early records, Gus Dudgeon or his orchestrator Paul Buckmaster, which I thought somewhat remiss.Fletcher directs the musical numbers with some flair, occasionally adapting the song lyrics to fit the screenplay, but is less certain in depicting the dramatic episodes in the singer's life, which too often flirt with cliche.The film is certainly flash, brash and loud and Elton would probably admit that these adjectives accurately described him at the height of his success but trying to encompass so much into a mere two hour film, just too many short-cuts are taken with a different song to fit in every ten minutes or so, the characterisations, particularly Elton's, rarely run deep.Still, the film was a good reminder of his glory days and just how high-quality his music was at that time but unfortunately I got the sense that the Elton John here lived up more to his tabloid image than his real self.",Rocketman
31,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Dazzling, well acted biography of a modern great",9,3 July 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGrowing up in Pinner, with his emotionally negligent father and domineering mother, young Reginald Dwight showcased a prodigious talent for the piano, which saw him penning his own songs, before adopting the stage name of Elton John (Taron Egerton). From here, he developed a personal and professional partnership with songwriter Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) and enjoyed phenomenal success but was also plunged into a wild, hedonistic world of celebrity, parties, drink and drugs, as well as a struggle with his own sexuality, that almost threatened to send him over the edge.It's a bit of a risk making a dramatization of the life of a 'living legend', where the slightest deviation from the truth could result in a lawsuit. And so director Dexter Fletcher has taken a brave risk with this musical biopic of one Mr Elton John, which, given he's aware of it and probably seen it, means it must have met with his approval. Which can only mean his life has been every bit as wild and outrageous as Fletcher has portrayed it to be. He's certainly a character who provides interesting subject matter for a biopic, and Rocketman is a slightly disconcerting but still effective and well made production that delivers the goods.Although you might expect it to be a musical (given its subjects profession) it's not made immediately clear, and when the first musical numbers come through, they catch you off guard and unsettle the tone somewhat. They're not expected, given unlike recent musicals such as Jersey Boys and Bohemian Rhapsody, it's not been adapted from a stage musical, plus there's been the 2013 Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra, which featured no musical numbers. Still, on their own, they're electrifying, and when they become more consistent towards the end, they slot into the backdrop of the story, as the film delves into Elton's personal issues and wild excesses.If you can appreciate it in the format it's in, it's wonderful work, with a strong lead performance from Egerton, really capturing the spirit of the flamboyant but troubled John. It manages to include most (but obviously not all!) of his back catalogue, and for the true devotees, will serve the same function as the Broadway stage musical it obviously wants to be. ****",Rocketman
32,MOscarbradley,A warts-and-all biopic.,8,29 May 2019,"Unlike ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which director Dexter Fletcher is said to have a hand in after Bryan Singer 'left' the project, ""Rocketman"" is less of a straightforward rock star biopic and more of a jukebox musical that uses the songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin to tell the story of one, Reg Dwight, who remodeled himself, as in any good adult fairytale, from a shy schoolboy into a glam-rock icon called Elton John. It's also, presumably, more truthful since it was made with Elton's blessing and gives us a warts-and-all portrait that lets us see the monster he was, or at least believed he was, before turning into the sweet-natured, sober and charitable saint he is now and whatever you think of his music I suppose credit must be given for such an unflattering picture of a living artist.That leaves the question, is it any good? Well, actually yes. There are missteps to be sure; not all the production numbers come off and there's a little bit too much misery before he seeks rehab. It's told in flashback, ending when he reinvents himself as the Elton we know now and before meeting his husband, David Furnish but it's a well-told tale, (Lee Hall wrote the fine screenplay), and it does have an outstanding performance from Taron Egerton as the Rocketman of the title. If Rami Malek can pick up an Oscar for putting in a pair of false teeth and camping it up as Freddie Mercury then Egerton, who does his own singing, should at least get nominated for what is a much better performance. There's good work, too, from Jamie Bell as Taupin and nice cameos from Stephen Graham and Gemma Jones, (the granny).The villain of the piece is nasty Richard Madden as John Reid who gets Elton coked up and into bed and then treats him like dirt and unfortunately Madden can't give his character any shadings, if indeed he had any, Their sex scenes might put off a few Aunt Ednas and rednecks but then it's unlikely they would be going to see an Elton John biopic in the first place.

33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A decent entry in an underserved genre.,6,26 May 2019,"'Rocketman (2019)' initially seems like a refreshing step in the right direction for the most consistently restrictive genre there is: the music biopic. Its fairly unique presentation as an actual musical leads to some entertaining sequences and the fact that it's frank about its protagonist's troubles is certainly welcome - especially coming off the back of its recent unavoidable comparison, 'Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)'. However, this is soon all revealed to, essentially, be nothing more than a veneer. The foundations of the feature are as rigid as ever, forcing the whole thing to follow the predictable beats of its predictable genre practically to the letter. It's actually quite remarkable how similar the lives of most music biopics' subjects are. Still, this isn't an excuse. The formulaic plot that this follows isn't just sub-par because we've seen it before, either. It spends too much time on John's childhood without really saying anything significant - at least, anything that couldn't be conveyed in a single scene or, even, line later on - and it seriously rushes the third act, placing a lot of seemingly important stuff in an annoying 'text ending'. It's frustrating because the style is quite appealing, it just far outweighs the substance and it didn't have to. The musical moments are entertaining and it doesn't feel like John was interfering with the narrative in any way - in fact, it seems as though it would be quite painful for him to watch. However, the musical segments don't do anything significant for the plot, either just harmlessly slotting into scenes or replacing montages where they'd usually be found anyway, and the honesty - which isn't typically absent from good biopics - doesn't do anything, really, other than make the movie feel a little downbeat. This is, again, thanks to the rushed ending; the majority of the film is dedicated to John's substance abuse and self-love troubles but these are all resolved incredibly quickly, if somewhat satisfyingly. I think the main reason that the flick gets away with as much as it does is the performances. Everyone on screen is great, especially Egerton (which is, incidentally, another cliché of the genre). It's also fantastic that he did his own singing. Generally, the experience is quite entertaining, too. It does wear a little thin, though, especially when you realise how closely it conforms to the tropes of its genre. It's just frustrating, really, because there are flashes of a much better film in here; the first few moments set up something quite counter-intuitive and potentially great. It's not great, though. Of course, it's not bad, either. It's a decent entry in an underserved genre. 6/10",Rocketman

It gives a pretty good idea of what a life of non-stop seventies sex, drugs and rock'n'roll - not necessarily in that order - must have been like to experience; and fortunately spares us Diana's funeral.",Rocketman
35,dromasca,the Rennaissance of the musical genre continues,9,12 June 2019,"Elton John accompanies my passion for pop and rock music for nearly 50 years. I confess that I was not an unconditional fan of Elton over all these years, the celebrities with bizarre behavior have not been and are not my cup of tea, but this musical directed by Dexter Fletcher managed not only to captivate me and make me vibrate (again ) to the music, but also to bring to light some of the roots of his way of being. Now, when Elton John's career seems to get close to an end (at least the touring part), there are chances for me to return to the ranks of his fans, thanks to this film.Dexter Fletcher should initially have directed 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and he was the one who finished the film after Bryan Singer left the production. In 'Rocketman' producer Elton John entrusted him from the very beginning with responsibility of making a film about his own biography, childhood, coming to age, building his artistic personality and personal crises. He was right, I guess. Fletcher demonstrates again his huge talent in making the audience live again the atmosphere of the British pop world of the years of glory and to get to know the heroes of this revolution with their musical genius, but also their personal problems, the confrontation with life as stars, with drugs, alcohol, sexuality. His contribution to the revival of the musical genre can not be disputed, but I think it's more than that, because Fletcher combines in his films the limits and freedoms of the 'musical' genre, which became part of the mainstream in Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s and the vibration of British rock. It is, if you want, a cinematic equivalent of the fusion that took place half a century ago between the pop in England and the rock and soul coming from overseas, from America.The fact that Elton John is an executive producer of the film may, on one hand, be an assurance to viewers that the biographical information presented in the film is accurate and verified, but may also raise the suspicion that the film conceals some less comfortable details. It seems to me that the latter doubts can largely be eliminated. The script written by Lee Hall does not make many concessions to the characters of the singer's parents, nor to the ones of the more or less true friends who accompanied his career, and especially not to Elton John himself. The singer is shown in the periods he searches to define himself as a musical personality but also as a human being, including in the uncomfortable relationships with those around him, with his loneliness and the crises that brought him to the verge of suicide just when he was reaching the peak of his career. Homosexuality issues are addressed much more directly than in the 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. The choice of Taron Egerton for the lead role of the artist's maturity period seemed to me to be excellent. The little-known actor shows his talent becoming Elton John on screen (including singing the musical part). The film is much less a musical biography in the strict sense of the cinematic genre and much more a true musical, with songs and dance numbers inserted in the story, not as entertainment but as a way of expression in the most dramatic points. But the film is entertaining, and sensitive, and a pleasure to watch and listen to. It's a good substantial musical that has the chances of winning new fans for Elton John, now and in the future.",Rocketman
36,ThomasDrufke,The Movie this Summer Needs,8,19 June 2019,"At this point, I can't really imagine this movie starring Tom Hardy, who was originally attached years ago. In many ways, it feels like Taron Egerton was born to play Elton John. In fact, some may say, myself included, that this is a better performance than Rami Malek gave as Freddie Mercury last year (also partially directed by Dexter Fletcher). Egerton sings and dances on his own and commits to this completely fantastical rendition of the acclaimed singer/songwriter. Although, in many ways it follows the same beats as a cliched music biopic, when it breaks out into song and Egerton spends time breaking down the character emotionally, 'Rocketman' entertains like no other. This is the type of summer movie we needed this year.8.3/10",Rocketman
37,Cineanalyst,Elton John Gets High on Psychotherapy: The Musical,6,2 November 2019,"Another musical biopic of a pop star from Dexter Fletcher, who was also behind completing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018), ""Rocketman"" is an improvement upon its predecessor in some ways, but an uneven movie in still others. Taron Egerton makes Elton John his own, and unlike Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury in the prior picture, reportedly does his own singing. This one is also different in that it's an integrated musical instead of a backstage one; that is, characters break into song and dance during their daily lives and, thus, the musical numbers are more ingrained in the narrative. ""Rocketman"" is like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939); whereas, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is nearer ""A Star Is Born"" (1954, or the two later ones, too). (I also recently viewed ""Judy"" (2019), another backstage musical biopic, and with Elton singing about ""the yellow-brick road,"" well, you get the idea....)At best, this integrated format supports a seemingly drug-induced momentum, from one stage in the star's life to the next, which is entertaining spectacle, including the dreamlike imagery. It's also apropos given the focus here on Elton's drug and other addictions. I'm less fond of the psychotherapy framing device, though, whereby he faces his mommy and daddy issues and related desires to be loved. Not exactly profound insights there in a production that's largely an Elton John vanity project in itself. Meanwhile, his music here largely does appear to come to him easily, which his mother criticizes of his life in general in one scene. Ditto his flamboyant concert performances. At least, in ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" there was a bit covered of the experimentation and genre-mixing that went into the success of Queen. On the other hand, ""Rocketman"" benefits from being rated R and so doesn't fear some depiction of drug abuse and gay sex, which is more than can be said of the PG-13 ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" where Mercury's romantic life was mainly and outrageously represented by his relationship with a woman. Like many others, I enjoy the rock and roll of Elton John and Queen, and these movies are pleasant vehicles for that, but they're also flawed and flimsy pictures otherwise.",Rocketman

41,tabuno,Creative and Contemporary Musical Perfection,10,3 June 2019,"Taron Egerton stars and sings in this biopic musical that offers up a compelling, creative, and artistic depiction of Elton John's life through both an absorbing storyline and a dazzling array of musical dance numbers. Reminiscent of the Oscar winning best picture Chicago (2002) in its brilliant display of innovative choreographed numbers, the multi-media display of a nominee for a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy Across the Universe (2007) and the heart throbbing excitement of the contemporaneous award-winning musical La La Land (2016). Rocketman does well in its powerful display of Elton's many songs with its lyrics in sync with an easy to follow editing of the chronological story of Elton's life from his terrible parents through to his sexuality and drug use and his struggle to become famous and then coping with his fame. The performances, the script, and the amazing creative endeavor all come together in a perfect fusion of sight and sound on the big screen.",Rocketman
42,ironhorse_iv,This jukebox musical didn't quite hit the right keys. Still it was watchable.,7,5 September 2020,"This bio-pic directed by Dexter Fletcher about musician Elton John's breakthrough years as he struggles with his sexuality and substance abuse was mostly fine. The problem comes from the fact that the movie used the same somewhat tiresome familiar old plots thread that most Rockstar films have. Some examples are the rag to riches rise, debauchery hedonism of that lifestyle, the break up and redemption. This movie mirrors countless flicks with similar premise like 2004 'Beyond the Sea', 2005 'Walk the Line' and most of all 2018 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which Fletcher help co direct. Barely anything in this film seem to stand out or seem unique. I thought the music video for Elton John's ""This Train Don't Stop There Anymore"" song had a better approach. It showed his career by detailing the real-life musician coming to terms with getting older and unable to sing the iconic falsetto notes any longer, with audio narrative intermixed with fantasy visuals of his past self, well performed by Justin Timberlake getting tired of the fame and partying. It was really good at cleverly hinting of Elton's past problems not over exploitation it like this movie. Regardless Taron Egerton did show an uncanny resemblance to John with use of flamboyant body language, voice and alright piano playing even if bit hammy. With great costumes and make up, he was convincing. I also did like some of the visual styles of the musical numbers. Even if the order of them wasn't really historical accurate, such in the case as the ""I'm Still Standing"" song sequence. That scene is supposed to represent Elton's full recovery from substance abuse. Yet in reality, in 1983 when John was still drinking heavily. In truth, he didn't seek out recovery until 1990. The film also left out the real reason that Elton decided to sober up which was a chance meeting with Ryan White; the poster child of the AIDS crisis who died one month before his high school graduation. The film kinda omitted that. Along with the fact that the singer also created Elton John AIDS Foundation. It's pretty sad that the screenwriter Lee Hall did that, because those events could had added a lot more to the movie. Nevertheless, Elton didn't really leave Madison Square Garden quickly in costume for a rehab group as the movie outrageously wants us to believe. Still the use ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" from the opening scene being played out as a triumphant entrance showing John at the height of his career and fame only to reveal that he's at his lowest point was brilliant. Then there is ""Saturday Night's Alright' scene that plays over a dance number that symbolizes the excitement of a child and adolescent versions of Reggie Dwight (Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor) transition into adulthood. It was a lot of fun; despite the song not being written by Elton about him, but Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), a man he has yet to meet in the film. As for the other, they're just as spectacular. 'Crocodile Rock' shows the out of body experience with everybody floating in the air even if it's not synced with the timeline. While ""I Want Love"" illustrates the sadness of Reggie with his family, even if the kin's public perception portrayal is a little bit over dramatic. For instance, Elton John's grandma wasn't the only one who supported his dream. In truth, both of parents help him out. Stanley Dwight (Steven Mackintosh) got Reggie his first piano and didn't really limited what the child wore. Later in his life, Stanley did see John perform many times irrespective from what the singer might believe. He wasn't as distance and cold as the film makes him out to be. Then there is his troublesome relationship with his mother Sheila whom is oddly played by American actress Bryce Howard Dallas whom not British nor mature enough for such roles. While they certainly had their disputes, she is portrayed more harshly in the movie as well. Much of their heat come from the fact that Sheila stayed friends with Elton's enemies like former driver Bob Halley which the movie doesn't talk about and John Reid whom played by Richard Madden in the movie. Like Stanley, she wasn't as critical of his life as a gay man in real life. Then that brings us to his harsh relationship with Reid. It's true that they were lovers, but there is hardly any record of predator like physical abuse between them in reality. In fact, Reid remained Elton's manager until 1998 when it was discovered that he had been spending Elton's money on oversees tour expenses. That's the true reason why they stop working with each other. Nevertheless, the fictional course of direction feels a little bit one sided as the film makes it look like getting into a homosexual relationship might be bad. It gave the wrong tone. Fletcher should have balance it with showing Elton meeting his eventual husband David Furnish rather than after credit telling us that. In truth the filmmakers should had cut the pointless Elton's impulsive straight marriage to German native Renate Blauel played by Celinde Schoenmaker, despite in reality the marriage actually lasted four years. Better yet they shouldn't had adapted out singer Long John Baldry who had a very meaningful role in Elton's life. Not only did he inspired Elton's stage name, but he is the one that save his life after a suicide attempt and aided in him coming to terms with his homosexuality. While all of his moments are given to Bernie. Him being there would have work better in tone. I also wouldn't mind a cameo Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury or mention of Princess Diana if that helps the movie be more developed. In the end the movie seemed unfinished. Overall: While this musical didn't quite go breaking my heart; it also didn't make me want to crocodile rock that much. It was only alright at best.",Rocketman
43,The-Sarkologist,Just Woah!,9,1 June 2019,"Okay, I don't like biopics, but for some reason a part of me wanted to see this film, not because I am a huge Elton John fan or anything, but rather because it looked interesting. Mind you, when I went to sit in the theatre a part of me started wondering what I had got myself into, particularly since in my mind Elton John was, to me at least, one of the good guys of rock and roll. Well, that turned out not to be the case at all.One of the reasons I suspected that this film eventuated was due to the success of Bohemian Rhapsody. Look, this is no Bohemian Rhapsody, though there are a number of similarties between Elton John and Freddy Mercury. Well, not that much because while Elton John certainly has dominated the music scene for such a long time, none of his songs could go down in the chronicles of rock history the way Bohemian Rhapsody has. The other thing is that while he is a prodigy when it comes to playing a piano, he simply has no ability to come up with lyrics, which is why his friend Bernie Taupin wrote pretty much most of the lyrics for John's songs.The movie is told as a form of a flash back, after Elton decided that enough was enough, walks out of one of his concerts, and signs himself into rehab. Not surprisingly, he walks in and begins telling his story, but what is interesting is that as the story progresses, he goes from his flamboyant self to becoming, well, plan dressing. In fact, it seems that after this episode Elton seemed to have toned down a lot, though I guess in a way he had come of age.Yeah, this is about his struggle with drugs, and well, everything. This, well, isn't all that surprising, though I never realised that Elton had such a huge drug problem, yet it seems as if it is something that pretty much all rockers go through. Some survive, others don't. Elton turned out to be one of the lucky ones, though he doesn't seem to go down in the annals alongside the likes of Keith Richards and Ozzy Osbourne.The other thing that grabbed me was that this film was much more of a musical than was Bohemian Rhapsody. In many ways it felt a lot more psychodelic, despite me not really considering Elton's music to be all that psychodelic. Yet having all the songs playing, and playing at moments that were reflective of his life at the time, was also pretty good. Mind you, considering that he never wrote any of his lyrics I'm not entirely sure whether these songs really have any meaning anyway.The other thing that stands out is the idea of loneliness. It seems that throughout the movie we are constantly confronted with how lonely Elton seems to be. Sure, he has a huge party at his mansion, and then spends the entire time in his room with a bottle. There are also suggestions that his sexual orientation was a cause of that, but that is pretty much struck down at the end, and the comment was mostly something that was probably floating around during the seventies. I guess the thing is that being rich and famous can actually be quite a lonely endeavour, and goes to show that money really can't buy happiness.One final thought is that of John Reid. He was Elton's lover, and also managed Queen for a period during the 70s. Honestly, it really isn't all that flattering, despite the fact that he is still alive and living in Australia. From Bohemian Rhapsody he wasn't painted as a particularly nice guy, nor was he portrayed that way in this film either. It sort of makes me wonder why he hasn't kicked up a stink. Then again, maybe it was just my interpretation.",Rocketman

45,paulclaassen,Wonderful fantasy musical!!,7,8 May 2020,"'Rocketman' could easily have been just another biopic. Instead, it is a beautiful fantasy musical. I thought it kinda weird at first watching a documentary film about an artist who is very much alive still. But eventually realized the film only documents his life until the 70's.Even if you're not an Elton John fan, this is a film that will appeal to everyone. The musical scenes are wonderful, colorful and vibrant. I also rather enjoyed the different versions of some of his popular songs.Having done a bit of research on Elton John - and with Elton as executive producer - 'Rocketman' is a pretty accurate depiction of the music icon's life. The attention to detail is incredible. Elton was a flamboyant, outspoken and openly gay man in a time when homosexuality was still a controversial topic. Interesting also, was the fact that Elton actually married (a woman) 'to try something new'. Needless to say it didn't pan out so well. For those who still didn't realize Elton was gay (yeah right!), the film might reveal more than you wanted to know about the superstar. Taron Egerton's performance as Elton is wonderful!I also enjoyed the fact Bernie Taupin features prominently in the film, being the brainchild behind most of Elton's chart topping songs. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Rocketman' and it's feel-good ending. Loved it!",Rocketman

The direction which was made by Dexter Fletcher was amazing and he managed to combine very well the music of Elton John with some of his dramatic experiences and also with some difficult moments of his life. The interpretation of Taron Egerton who played as Elton John was simply amazing and it was obvious through the whole duration of the film that he studied a lot about Elton John. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Steven Mackintosh's who played as Stanley, Bryce Dallas Howard's who played as Sheila and Jamie Bell's who played as Bernie Taupin and they were all magnificent. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because even if you are not a fan of Elton John I am sure that you will love it.",Rocketman
47,cruise01,Amazing performance from Taron Egerton and a great biopic story.,8,1 June 2019,"Rocketman (4 out of 5 stars).Rocketman is one ordinary biographical musical film that delivers with an amazing performance from Taron Egerton and a fantasy musical direction that showcases the highlights of Elton John and the rise and downfall in his life. I am a fan of Elton John and his music. The movie does show from his high points in his career to his struggle with his relationship with his mother and father. And his addiction to alcohol and drugs. The film also focuses on his relationship with John Reid (Richard Madden) who is also his manager and abusing his power as a manager.The plot is a good biopic showing Elton (Taron Egerton) always wanting to be a musician since as a kid. After his father wants nothing to do with him and his mother not really caring about him. He meets a song writer Bernie (Jamie Bell) which they become best friends. And after a few songs attracting a few managers. And one of them being John Reid (Richard Madden). Which they both fall for each other.Taron Egerton delivered as Elton John. From his dramatic performance to his musical sequences. He sure can sing. And the outstanding flashy wardrobe. Jamie Bell is also good as well. Playing his lifelong friend. Richard Madden was good playing John Reid, a shady manager. Bryce Dallas Howard was also good playing Elton's mother.This is no straight up biopic film. The script and direction did turn this biopic into a musical film. From the opening scene with Elton walking towards an addiction group to discuss moments from his life. Turning some events into a musical about how he was feeling. It worked. There are some great fun musical sequences and the songs were great. The cast ensemble all had a moment in a musical. Sure, the audience will be cheering for it.The film also focused on his rough relationship with his father. Which can be emotional that brought him into his addiction. And his emotional abusive boyfriend John Reid.I did feel like the film ran a little too long. With a few musical sequences too many which ruined the pacing of the movie. That slowed the progress of the story.Overall, Rocketman is a good biographical musical film. Taron Egerton should be nominated for awards for his outstanding performance as the legendary Elton John. The film has some fun musical sequences and some powerful dramatic moments. Which turns a biopic story into a fantasy musical story.",Rocketman
48,zkonedog,All About The Music And That Works Here!,8,24 June 2019,"When I think of biopics, especially about musicians, I think of films like ""Walk The Line"" or ""Love & Mercy"" that told pretty much straight biography stories and then interspersed the artist's music at certain points. That is not the approach taken in ""Rocketman"". No, this one is all about the music, and because it's the legendary Elton John, it works basically as well as anything.For a basic overview, this film tells the story of Sir Elton, both as a young Reginald Dwight (Matthew Illesley) and the uber-star he would later grow into (Taron Egerton). Many of his now-infamous tunes are covered in song-and-dance numbers, all painting a narrative of his struggle to make it in the music business, come to terms with his sexuality, and deal with drug & alcohol problems.If you want a basic idea of how ""Rocketman"" unfolds, think of a movie like ""La La Land"", where it's basically a straight drama that routinely transitions into elaborate song. In this case, though, it could almost be better described as a musical about John that is interspersed with a little bit of bio. If I had list this under a genre, it would be ""Musical"" and not ""Drama"" or ""Biography'. Normally, I have a feeling that this approach might not work for many audiences, but in the case of Elton John his songs are so iconic and cut through the generations that I feel the film-makers make the appropriate choice in putting the music front and center.The bio material is still present, but in all honesty it plays out in pretty much cookie-cutter fashion, including the standard points of parental arguments, manager feuds, substance abuse, and reclamation attempts in the end. Whether this is because that's literally how Elton's life went or because the film-makers needed that sort of drama I am not sure, but fortunately those scenes are not the heart of the movie.No, what you'll mainly take away from this experience is some amazingly-produced numbers of many of John's greatest hits (he had so many they couldn't all even be included!). I can almost guarantee that before you are practically even out of the theater, you'll be browsing your music subscription of choice for Elton John playlists.All in all, I enjoyed ""Rocketman"" even more than I thought I would. I was worried that the unconventional approach would turn me off, but it ended up being the perfect choice instead. It may not be an incredibly deep-dive into the life of John, but it still hits all the necessary notes (pardon the pun) and provides some incredible musical numbers you won't soon forget.",Rocketman
49,leonblackwood,Expected a deeper insight into Elton John's life! 4/10,4,30 January 2020,"Review:
When I heard that they were making an Elton John biopic, I thought that they were going to give the audience a deep insight into his flamboyant life, but we ended up with a weak musical, which didn't really tell us anything new. As soon as the ""Guys & Dolls"" type musical numbers began, I cringed in disbelief, and the way that the director only touched on the interesting things about his life, was disappointing. As Elton John is still alive, and he was the executive producer of the film, I thought that we were going to get a really deep movie that will make us want to go out and find out more about the musical genius like I did when I first watched the Doors, but I was left feeling empty and uneducated. Also, if I want to hear a classic Elton John song, I wouldn't want to hear a Taron Egerton version, so I found all of the musical numbers a bit pointless. That's not to say that he didn't put in an excellent performance, which he will be remembered for, but I was more interested in the drama than the music. Anyway, the movie kicks off with Elton John (Taron Egerton) dressed in a flamboyant devil's outfit, as he enters an addiction rehabilitation session, recounting his life in a flashback. Young Reginald Dwight grows up in 1950's Britain, raised by his unaffectionate mother, Sheila (Bryce Dallas Howard), and more loving grandmother Ivy (Gemma Jones). Reginald is interested in music and hopes to perform for his father, Stanley (Steven Mackintosh), who takes no interest in his son nor his talent. Reginald begins piano lessons, making his way into the Royal Academy of Music. Stanley abandons his family after Sheila has an affair. Reginald develops an interest in rock music and begins performing in local pubs. As an adult, Reginald joins the band Bluesology, which is hired to play backup for touring American soul bands, The Isley Brothers and Patti LaBelle and the Blue Belles. Isley Brothers lead singer Ronald Isley recommends that Reginald writes songs and puts his old life behind him if he wants to become a famous artist. This inspires Reginald to change his name to Elton John. Elton is the name of the saxophonist of Bluesology and John being adapted from the Beatle's John Lennon. Elton begins writing music and tries finding success with Dick James label, DJM Records under the management of Ray Williams. Williams introduces Elton to lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), and they form a friendship and move into a flat together to work on their songs. When Elton admits he is homosexual, he ends his romantic relationship with their landlady, and he and Bernie are evicted. Elton and Bernie move in with Elton's grandmother, his mother and her significant other where they continue writing and create ""Your Song"". James sets up a performance for them at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Elton is nervous before his Troubadour debut, but the audience eagerly embraces his performance. Elton is overjoyed by his success but feels abandoned when Bernie leaves him at a party to spend time with a woman. He is approached by John Reid (Richard Madden), a music manager. They sleep together and reunite later. Reid's influence over Elton launches a downward spiral into a life of debauchery even as his career rises to high heights. Elton develops a flamboyant, over-the-top stage persona and becomes one of the most successful artists of the 1970s. Reid's manipulation increases into outright abuse after becoming Elton's manager. Reid insists that Elton come out to his parents as gay, so Elton reconnects with his father, who has a new family but still displays no interest in Elton. Unhappy and hurt, Elton calls his mother and tells her he is gay. She informs him that she already knew, but tells Elton he will be forever unloved. Struggling with parental issues as well as Reid's increasing physical and emotional abuse, Elton becomes addicted to alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, shopping and sex. His mood swings and short temper alienate his friends, and he catches Reid cheating on him with another man and breaks off their relationship. During a party, Elton binges on drugs and alcohol and attempts suicide by jumping into his pool. He is rushed to the hospital, then thrust on stage at Dodger Stadium to perform. Elton descends further into a life of drugs, alcohol and loneliness. He has a short-lived marriage with a close female friend, Renate, but his homosexuality dooms his relationship. He falls out with his mother and Bernie. Elton's dependence on prescription pills and alcohol result in a heart attack. Realising his life is out of control, Elton seeks help. He enters rehabilitation and realises he no longer needs support from his parents or Reid. Elton rekindles his friendship with Bernie, who brings him new lyrics. Elton is worried that he cannot perform or compose without alcohol or drugs but writes ""I'm Still Standing"" and returns to a successful career. After the success of Bohemian Rhapsody, which was a proper biopic without the pathetic singing and dancing numbers, I thought the director would have taken a leaf out of Bryan Singer's book, but he chose to concentrate on matters that are well known. In terms of entertainment, it wasn't a bad watch because it showed what he was going through whilst releasing some of his most popular work, but I can't help thinking that it was way too safe. Oliver Stone pushed the boundaries with the Doors, even though Jim Morrison isn't alive, so he used his imagination to come up with his interpretation of how Jim was feeling while he was intoxicated on drugs and alcohol. This director didn't even try to show Elton's point of view when he was totally out of it, so I felt a bit cheated. Anyway, it's worth a watch for Taron's performance but I think another director needs to tell Elton's true-life story, from a deeper point of view. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Dexter Fletcher, who brought you Wild Bill in 2011, Sunshine on Leith and Eddie the Eagle, which also starred Taron Egerton. He's due to direct the next Sherlock Holmes movie, taking over from Guy Ritchie, which I personally don't think is a good idea. I haven't been that impressed with his movies so far, so he wouldn't have been my first choice to make a biopic about such an iconic genius. He's not totally to blame for this film because Elton John didn't want a ""full-out"" biopic about his life. He wanted people to see a lighter version of his life story, so I can't wait to see a deeper version. As long as Dexter Fletcher doesn't return as the director.Budget: $40million

50,TheMovieDiorama,Rocketman is no Tiny Dancer but isn't exactly Still Standing.,6,24 May 2019,"Rocketman is no Tiny Dancer but isn't exactly Still Standing. And I think it's going to be a long, long time before these crowdpleasers fill my soul with pure enjoyment. Very similar to last year's 'Bohemian Rhapsody', I find myself in the internal battle for conforming to an opinion that readers will appreciate but understand, or give it that elusive perfect rating because it's ""enjoyable"" to the point that flaws are ignored. I mean, this is coming from an individual who isn't particularly enamoured by Elton John or musicals for that matter. Sorry to say, and it certainly is the hardest word to say, that this musical biopic packs sequins and extravagant costumes only to follow the most uninspired clichéd narrative structure that has been recycled time and time again. Elton attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and revisits the life that he has lived, leading him to the dangers that fame and fortunes bring.As I mentioned, I'm not a massive fan of Elton John. Mainly because I didn't particularly grow up with his music, or was remotely interested in his personal life, however I will say the man has undeniable talent. This film depicts that wonderfully. From when he was a musical prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music to writing legendary songs with his musical partner Bernie Taupin. Hall's screenplay, with both John and his husband Furnish overseeing the end product, captures his life and condenses it down adequately where the pivotal moments are illustrated with emotion and pride. John seemingly did not want to shy away from his downfall with drugs, depression and sex addiction, which makes Rocketman that instantly more personable. Over half of the film's runtime tackles his succumbing to depression, and is more often that not heartbreaking to watch. Don't go breaking my heart, Elton!Fortunately Fletcher keeps the tone light by integrating fantastical musical numbers that depict Taupin's lyrics and reflects them through John's life. ""I'm Still Standing"" and ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" being the most notable examples. Ridiculous show stopping costumes, packed with all of John's razzle dazzle, allow for these musical numbers to glow and illuminate the stage. These outlandish attires were effortlessly worn by Egerton, who simply gives his best performance to date. The perfect balance of emotion and character interpretation, without leading to a caricature performance. It's obvious that Egerton looks up to John as a role model, and he did a stunning job. Heck, even his singing voice is pretty decent! Bell and Madden gave solid supporting performances, although weren't given enough to make a lasting impression. Howard on the other hand, I felt, was miscast as John's mother. Her American accent creeped in on occasion, and she seemed out of place considering the predominantly British cast.However, unfortunately I come to aspect of this review that I'm sure will garner some discussions. It's no surprise that the narrative structure for Rocketman offers the same clichés found in every other mainstream musical biopic. Start of a career, rise to fame, corruption of fame and money, near-death scenario and then the inevitable moment where the singer/songwriter turns their life around. Predictable to the very tip of the writer's pen. And with that, there was an overbearing sense of familiarity that prevented me personally from fully enjoying this. Despite John's melancholic depressive state, that may catch many off guard, it did feel occasionally boring. Surprisingly, with John and Furnish onboard as producers, the film wasn't as self-indulgent as I expected.But John's views on his parents, accessible to us on most tabloid papers, unfortunately taint these characters. They are written with such animosity, to the point that they become almost inhuman, preventing us from understanding their perspective on the complex childhood that John had to endure. They were one-dimensional antagonists. I'm sure they weren't pleasant to John, but some dimensionality towards them would've made for understandable sympathy. The final criticism I have is with the ending. It just ends. It's no spoiler that John eventually turns his life around. Yet as soon as he does, we are presented with typical onscreen text depicting the rest of his life. Underwhelming, I must confess.It may sound like I'm being overly critical, but that's only because these glaring issues are noticeable to me. You may enjoy the film better than I did, and I would not judge you for it. Elton John is undoubtedly a legend, and this subjective statement alone will attract several audiences into what is an enjoyable musical. Rocketman unfortunately failed to lift off for me, and seemed like an exercise in therapy for Sir Elton John.",Rocketman
51,Ed-Shullivan,"Elton John is amazing, and he is a complicated man....this film reflects his tormented side",10,31 December 2019,"Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John is superb and only heightened by the producers allowing Taron to sing his own versions of many of Elton John's classic hits. It would be impossible to capture all aspects of Elton John's life in the 2 hours provided in this musical/biographical film, so instead the producer/writer/director concentrated on Elton's early childhood which helped shape his destiny when he first met his partner in song writing the great Bernie Taupin played by Jamie Bell.There were far too many other excellent performances from the supporting cast members to mention them all but I have to mention two in particular who were top notch. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elton's irresponsible (wife cheating) mother, and Richard Madden who plays John Reid one of Elton's early but serious lovers remained Elton's manager for decades after their sexual relationship ended. Both of these actors added a lot to the films depth in the one area that focused on Elton's tormented soul and led him to binge drinking and pill popping which is the area this film reflected.I hope we don't have to wait for Elton John to pass away (God forbid) before some producer realizes that Elton John and Bernie Taupin whose lifestyles and personalities are so diametrically opposite that they deserve their life stories to be developed into a (minimum) ten (10) hour TV Mini-Series to cover a heck of a lot of both of these musical genius's personal lives as well as their successes with their musical portfolios.Rocketman is well worth seeing and rates a perfect 10 out of 10 in my version of Elton John's quasi autobiography book.",Rocketman

53,matthewssilverhammer,Better Than Bohemian Rhapsody,7,6 June 2019,"Rocketman has something very specific in common with (believe it or not) Deadpool. Both hang their hats on the idea that they are uniquely subversive stand-outs in their particular genres: Rocketman being a psychedelic, non-linear musical biopic, and Deadpool being a fourth-wall breaking, tongue-in-cheek superhero flick. While the skin and dressing of these films is certainly noteworthy, the soul of them is never far from their genre trappings. If you've seen Walk Hard, it's hard to miss the genre clichés Rocketman is playing in. Nonetheless, the highly-stylized musical numbers, along with the sheer amount of unexpected weirdness, make Rocketman fly above its banal shortcomings.
The comparisons to Bohemian Rhapsody are inevitable: the true story of a closeted British rock star from the 70s dealing with his success through sex and drugs, peppered with classic pop songs. Both are ""greatest hits"" biopics, less concerned with over-arching storytelling than with hitting the high notes and corny clichés.
However, what Rocketman gets right are its oddities. Like Elton himself, the movie is a cinematic display of flamboyant excess, with a dark sadness flowing just beneath the surface. Egerton continues his star ascension here, and he's strong with the little story he is given (most successfully centered on his relationship with writing partner Bernie Taupin). Instead of a linear ""here's-how-this-song-came-about"" storyline, it's a jukebox musical, with entire scenes bursting into unexpected song-and-dance numbers.
Could easily see this being on Broadway someday, and maybe that's where it really belongs, or as viewed as a string of high-production music videos. Nonetheless, in its current theatrical form, it's a toe-tapping good time that does justice to some truly incredible music, and leaves you wanting more Elton.",Rocketman

His father didn't care about him,his mother didn't care about him either but she wasn't as bad as Reginald's father. We also get to see Elton falling downhill with drink,drugs and even suicide attempts along with his sexuality.What I really liked about this film was the visuals along with Taron's singing and acting chops. For a man who had to play a UK skier in Eddie The Eagle to this,I really hope he wins or gets an Oscar 2020 nod for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. This film is told in flashbacks btw as we see Elton in rehab.
Also stars Richard Madden as John Reid who had an affair with Elton John,an unreconisable Bryce Dallas Howard as Elton's mother,Jamie Bell as Bernie who Elton works with organising songs as well as fancing him and even Hercules himself Tate Donovan stars as a club manager in the states.Keep an eye out for Keith Lemon from Celebirty Juice.

56,paul-allaer,"""Victim of Love"" looking for redemption",6,1 June 2019,"""Rocketman"" (2019 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about Elton John, ""based on a true fantasy"" as we were promised in the movie's trailer. As the movie opens, Elton is in an outrageous costume and he staggers into what we then understand is his very first AA meeting. Elton begins telling his life story to the group, and as he starts singing "", the movie morphs back to Elton's early childhood. We get to know Reggie Dwight as a 5 yr. old, living with his miserable parents (his dad is cold and aloof, to say the least), but Reggie takes an immediate interest in his dad's record collection... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: Elton John's biopic has been in development hell for many years (at one point Justin Timberlake was attached to play Elton), but the movie is finally here, directed by Dexter Fletcher, who also came to the rescue for last year's Freddie Mercury bio-pic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". The interesting thing is that these 2 movie's couldn't be more different. Whereas ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" follows the traditional bio-pic path, ""Rocketman"" does not, and cannot be relied upon to be an accurate reflection of Elton John's musical career (example: it shows Elton performing ""Crocodile Rock"" at one of the famed 1970 LA Troubadour shows, a song from several years later that he didn't perform in 1970). Later on, ""Rocketman"" (the song) is played out as a long fantasy scene in a pool. And so on. The movie feels more like a Broadway play, and in fact I will state right now that it's only a matter of time before this becomes a mega-Broadway show. The other big difference with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is that the songs we hear are sung by Taron Egerton (best known for his role in the ""Kingsman"" movies and also in ""Eddie the Eagle""), and often in dramatically different arrangements than the originals. Let's be clear: Egerton is absolutely fantastic as Elton, and he also has a great voice, but there is something slightly unsettling about hearing these songs in such a different way. But in the end, the movie clearly is about love (or the lack thereof), and Elton's never-ending journey for redemption (which he eventually finds). The movie does not shy away from Elton's love for men (and the movie is rated R accordingly). ""Victim of Love"" is surely what he was, and the song is featured prominently in the film. But the ultimate redemption is equally deserved (as we see in the end-titles update).""Rocketman"" was released wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a fairly large theater was sold out to the very last seat. I quite enjoyed the movie, although I don't think it's up to the same level as ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" but Taron Egerton deserves props for his performance. If you have any interest in Elton John or in rock history, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Rocketman
57,subxerogravity,Good... just good.,7,12 June 2019,"In comparison with Bohemain Rhapsody, this is no Bohemain Rhapsody. Not that Bohemain Rhapsody was ok that good but I enjoyed it far more.
I'm thinking I'm not as big of an Elton John fan as I thought plus it feels like someone adapted a broadway musical as the cast song his songs in that format rather than the cast of Rhapsody acting like a Queen cover band
I'm sure real fans will enjoy the story, but it did little for me.",Rocketman
58,jtindahouse,Surprisingly dark,7,13 June 2019,"There was never any way that 'Rocketman' was going to avoid being compared to 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Which is a little unfortunate because 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a masterpiece. 'Rocketman' is an excellent film, however it couldn't live up to what that film managed to achieve. They're similar films, although rather different in a number of ways too. 'Rocketman' has a lot of spontaneous singing with back-up dancers appearing out of nowhere, making it feel more like a musical. I didn't mind that to be honest. It was what it was and didn't pretend to be anything differently.This is also a much darker film than the other one was. Both deal with a couple of very depressed artists in their prime, but this film really rams it home. There are a tremendous amount of unlikeable characters in this film. Apart from Elton himself, there is really only one likeable one that I can think of. It's almost a relief when he is on screen because otherwise the film is just too bleak.I was thoroughly impressed by Taron Egerton's performance. He maybe didn't ""become"" Elton to the extent that Rami Malek became Freddie Mercury, however his singing was excellent and his acting in the emotional scenes was of a very high standard. Elton John fans will have a particularly good time with this film, but even if you're not his biggest fan I think there is enough here to keep you satisfied and interested.",Rocketman
59,Turfseer,Tale of iconic pop superstar devolves into A Star is Born (but with much better music!),6,26 July 2019,"After taking over the helm of Bohemian Rhapsody when disgraced director Bryan Singer was forced out, director Dexter Fletcher is back, this time covering an even more iconic pop star, Elton John. His Rocketman has been described as a ""jukebox musical"" but with all of John's songs out of chronological order. So for example, John's 2001 hit, I want love, ends up at the beginning of the picture, during John's childhood, sung by the young Elton and his parents.
John apparently wanted it this way as the songs are supposed to reflect his inner feelings at the time and since some of them are staged as over the top spectacles (during the Rocketman number, actor Taron Edgerton playing John is shot into the sky as a rocket!), one tends to ignore the haphazard chronology.
As for Edgerton, he's probably best with the choreography, staging some entertaining, up tempo dance numbers throughout (coupled with a multitude of nifty costume choices). Less successful are his vocals which are decent enough but let's face it, how can anyone equal the Elton John originals?
The film starts with a framing device as John walks into what appears to be an AA meeting and begins telling his story from the beginning. For a good part of the film, his life in flashbacks is not only entertaining (due to the great music) but quite informative as well. Especially interesting is John's musical talent as a child-he could hear a tune on the radio and play it back on the piano immediately!
Less successful is screenwriter Lee Hall's depiction of John's parents who come off as unaffectionate and distant (the father) or highly critical (the mother). This is based on John's recollections to this day; apparently the pop star was particularly distressed by memories of his father Stanley (Steven Mackintosh) showing affection to his stepbrothers later on.
But other family members (particularly John's stepmother) disputed John's portrait of a remote and unfeeling parent. She reported that she still has the receipt for John's original piano which the father purchased (not the mother, which is what John recalls). Furthermore, the stepmother maintains John's father was actually proud after he became famous and attended his concerts.
The same goes for the vindictive portrait of the mother who actually blurts out that she wished she never had children in the film. But the real life story appears more complex as John's mother Sheila (Bryce Dallas Howard) often defended her son and expressed pride in his success. It might have been better if director Fletcher overruled John and his screenwriter and presented a more sympathetic, balanced picture of the parents.
John's rise to the top keeps us absorbed as we learn many things about how he became successful. Of particular interest is his stint as a child prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music; his time as a teenager with Bluesology, a rock band that ends up playing backup for a touring American soul band; how he met his lyricist, Bernie Taupin (an endearing Jamie Bell) and his doomed dalliance with manager John Reid (Richard Madden), with whom he has his first gay relationship.
Rocketman eventually morphs into the similar cinematic tale of alcohol addiction, A Star is Born (except having much better music). John's debauchery is on full display toward the last third of movie and it suffers due to the obsession with the icon's sad sack days. His resurrection into a sober and confident married father, now accepting his sexuality, is only mentioned briefly during the closing credits. Yes of course it happened but somehow there could have been a little less emphasis on this sad chapter and rather emphasizing much more of the positive in the multi-talented singer/composer's life.
For all its limitations, Rocketman still manages to entertain and inform, so it's worth a shot, even if you must wait until it appears on cable TV.",Rocketman
60,jamesrupert2014,Entertaining but fanciful soft-focus 'biopic' of legendary showman,7,11 October 2019,"A young artist struggles with family, passions, and demons to become one of the top acts in the world as his personal life disintegrates - a true(ish) story but nothing new. Taron Egerton is quite good as glittery soft-rock king Elton John but I found the framing device (an older John reminiscing while in therapy) gimmicky. There are a lot of memorable songs presented in a number of ways (sometimes sung all or in part by secondary characters) but not a lot of real/recreated footage of John's massive stage shows (the famous Dodger Stadium concert is recreated in part, one of the best scenes in the film). Like ""Bohemian Rhapsody' (2018) (the Freddie Mercury biopic with which 'Rocketman' is inevitably compared), the film deviates from the facts at times for dramatic effect (allegedly the harsh portrayal of John's father was inaccurate and unfair). Given the fantasy look of the film, viewers will likely not expect documentary verisimilitude but overall the film comes off as a bit of a vanity puff-piece, not surprising considering John himself was executive producer and had been pushing for the film for decades. While I didn't really like the film's structure, the filmmakers should be given credit for trying to do something different with a well-worn storyline.",Rocketman
61,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,7 June 2020,"I am honestly sort of split down the middle here. I mean, I THOUGHT it was going to be about Elton John... and it was......kind of...... but it was also a lot more fantasy and fiction than it was a biopic, and had I known that I might not have bothered watching it. I might have braced myself for something that isn't really realistic and more dream-sequence than straight film.So it's not at all what I was hoping for and that did kill it for me. I just wanted to watch a movie about Elton John. Hopefully see a fan movie about Elton John. Especially since I think that Bohemian Rhapsody did Freddy and his story a bit of a disservice.And instead... I got something a little more... Trippy than expected.So I guess, if you like how stylistic it is, you'll enjoy the movie... I mean, it IS about Elton John, so you have a great soundtrack guaranteed.To me, it just seems a little more music video than movie. And, this was Elton John, dude is interesting enough (especially given that he has been musically relevant for about 50 consecutive years), that they could have made it more... real I guess?I don't know.I guess in the end I am giving this one star, just because I was expecting more of a movie.",Rocketman

This is a musical fantasy biography of Elton John's life. I guess there will be more bio pics of musicians since the success of Bohemian Rhapsody but I liked Bohemian better. I like Elton John's music and Taron-who plays Elton-does his own singing here, unlike what they did in Bohemian. But the story is a little on the strange side. It starts with Taron/Elton going to a meeting for people with problems-You know the kind that start with, 'Hi, My name is Elton. I'm an alcoholic/drug addict/sex addict/shopaholic/etc.' The rest of the movie is flashbacks leading up to this moment. All of this is fine and dandy except that they use fantasy sequences that go into musical numbers and dancing frenzies so that you get to when you don't know what is real and what isn't. The music is good and I think Taron does a good job. Jamie plays Taron's writing partner Bernie Taupin-Bernie would write the songs and Elton would supply the music-and they had a good deal going on. Bryce plays Taron's mother and Richard plays a music producer. If you are a big fan of Elton John, you might like it more than I did-I'm a moderate fan-but don't take the kiddies. There are several sex scenes-no actual nudity but there is some partial and insinuated stuff-and some language. During the end credits, they will show a scene from the movie with Taron and then an actual scene of Elton, side by side so that you can compare how they captured the moment.
It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I might buy the soundtrack, though. Unless you are a big fan of Elton, I would just rent it.",Rocketman

The effect of glamor against the humble beginning and many lows is dazzling and vivid though we never quite leave the tinsel far behind.There is a lot to cover here but the structuring of the narrative is as good as it could be: they begin at the right place, they end at the right place and never dwell too long on anything. It can feel somewhat fragmented as we get more than a few climactic breakdowns but scene for scene its always rich and well paced.Moments of surrealism really help but the conversation scenes are also expertly crafted.The set pieces and musical numbers are phenomenal.I dare say this is everything the fans could have hoped for and more.At times it's really quite devastating.",Rocketman

68,jimbo-53-186511,Tortured genius,9,17 April 2020,"I reckon biopics for actors performing in the central role must be both exhilarating and terrifying - get it right and you'll be applauded by fans of the person you're portraying the world over; get it wrong though and you'll feel something of a failure and will feel disappointed that you haven't done justice to the person you're portraying. I can imagine Taron Egerton must have been nervous taking on the role of such an iconic singer, but in retrospect Egerton really had nothing to worry about...I think the best way for an actor to convince in this type of role is by way of 'absorbing' i.e they pretty much become the person that they are portraying. Forest Whittaker did this in The Last King of Scotland as did Will Smith (to a slightly lesser extent) in Ali. Egerton also absorbs and with a career as turbulent as Elton John's earlier career it gives Egerton plenty of scope to showcase his immense talents. What's really impressive about Egerton's performance is that he not only convinces in the acting stakes (when taking us through Elton's high and low career points), but his singing is also really good - OK he's no Elton John, but his voice is really good and his flamboyance and showmanship are very reminiscent of the man himself.Of course the picture isn't just about Egerton (although truth be told he is the main reason this film is as good as it is) the supporting cast are also good; the likes of Richard Madden as Elton's despicable manager and Jamie Bell as Elton's long-term writing partner Bernie Taupin are both excellent; Madden particularly so as at times he comes close to giving Egerton a run for his money albeit in a more low-key snivelling manner. These 2 men are sort of the catalysts of the picture who effectively bring out the best and worst in Elton John himself.Structurally, the film is also good as it gives brief snippets of Elton John's life and career at various stages in his life; from childhood through to around his late 20's/early 30's at a guess. I think what really makes Rocketman work so well is that it focuses its attention on Elton's career and the fact it focuses on his childhood to his rise to stardom makes it an interesting journey (there are no dumb or pointless sub-plots making this possibly one of the most focused films that I've seen). The film is also energetic, fast-paced and the musical numbers are colourful and lively (as indeed are some of the set-pieces that accompany them). Rocketman really was a joy to watch with never a dull moment clouding any aspect of the picture.Simply put it's one of the best biopics/musicals I've seen in quite some time and Egerton's performance is outstanding and, on the back of this performance, I suspect a long career in film is pretty much a certainty for Egerton.",Rocketman

Rocketman is an excellent musical as well as a gripping personal story of Elton John. The Taupin/John relationship is wonderfully crystalized, and the brilliance of Elton John's musical genius is professionally delivered by great direction and acting within the film. Although the lead actor seemed to be a bit off for casting, he and the rest of the cast were letter-perfect when it came to delivering the goods. The music, of course, is the real star of the film. Only the Beatles can match the scope and magnificence of Elton John's prodigious output over the course of many years in the music industry.

Now, admittedly while I like Elton's music, I knew next to nothing about his life spi was very interested to see this. Even more so, I was interested to see if Kingsman was just a fluke or if Taron Egerton has legit talent.This portrayal of Elton's life was just as wild as the man and seemed perfectly fitting the legend's flair for the dramatic. The costumes were wild, the music was on point. The parents seemed a little extra awful, which was maybe true but they seemed almost too awful to be real.The music is the real standout here. Taron Egerton actually singing the songs was a risky gamble but it absolutely pays off. He completely embodies the musical icon and his renditions of the songs really help complete his transformation into Elton's tortured persona.It's the easy, obvious comparison but putting this up against Bohemian Rhapsody... I like Queen more and I loved Rami Malek's performance, but Egerton really goes the extra mile here and right now I'd give Rocketman the slight edge.Comparison aside, this is fantastic fun, fan or not and absolutely worth watching.",Rocketman

The first half is very reminiscent of a stage musical, whereas the second half contains most of the drama. I personally would have liked the film to go further on in his life and maybe introduce David Furnish, but I understand the film would have lasted forever in that case.
Also, I would always like to see more nudity in any Taron Egerton film.
An amazing story about a very interesting man, featuring his great music.",Rocketman
75,dierregi,Whiny billioner rockstar lives happily hereafter,4,21 January 2021,"It's quite depressing to see that even the lives of luckier people - in this case rockstars - follow a predictable trajectory. Witness for the billionth time the rag-to-riches story of Reggie/Elton, from his neglecting family in the English suburbs to developing his spectacular talent and reaching stardom by 25.With fame and money comes despair and just like every other rockstar before and after, Elton goes ballistic with a debauched orgy of liquor, drugs and promiscuous sex. Nothing your ""average"" rockstar isn't familiar with.One may wonder why these fortunate people cannot just live happily and less selfishly, without ""descending into the tunnel of addictions"". No such luck for Elton. Unloved by his cold father, betrayed by his greedy lover/manager, poor Elton joins AA and hijacks all his meetings.To jazz up this predictable tale, the script goes for a musical-with-a-meaning option, opening with a costumed Elton going to his meeting, fast cut with some dance numbers and back to childhood in a semi-chronological take. Elton's songs are used to highlight each situation he's going through. A few are good, most are corny. The dance numbers are next to abominable.Elton fans might enjoy, but I am not one of them.PS and rest assured, your hero recovered, has been sober for 28 years, married and lives happily with hubby and two kids. All's well in Elton's world.",Rocketman
76,truemythmedia,"And I Think It's Gonna Be a Long, Long Time Before I Forget This One",8,9 July 2019,"Where ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a musical rock biopic for people who like rock concerts, ""Rocketman"" is a musical rock biopic for people who like musicals. Both have their flaws, but both, in the end, are remarkably entertaining. If I'm being honest, I think I preferred ""Rocketman"" to ""Bohemian"" if only because ""Rocketman"" was more inventive with its directing and storytelling and more honest about its central character's inner conflicts, but I also think that Rami Malek gave a better performance as Freddie Mercury than Taron Edgerton did as Elton John.
What makes ""Rocketman"" special is the way it's told. This film feels like a fantastical dream where one moment were in a dreary apartment and the next we go through a door and we're walking with Elton to perform on stage. There are choreographed dance sequences that include whole choruses of people, elaborate sets and costume changes that happen before our very eyes, and dozens of unique set pieces that make only brief appearances. This movie looks like a TON of work went into it, from replicating the designs of Elton's flamboyant wardrobe, to emulating the chaos he feels inside his mind, this movie does a ton to bring the flair of Elton to screen. Elton is eccentric if he's nothing else, of course I'd want his movie to be as eccentric as he is.

Taron Egerton gives an incredible performance as Elton John and sings his songs amazingly. The supporting performances from Jamie Bell, Bryce Dallas Howard and Richard Madden are all great.

81,jadepietro,Flying Slightly Above Most Musical Bios,8,6 June 2019,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fine performance by Taron Egerton and some fancy direction elevates Rocketman from its tethered script.JIM'S REVIEW: I remember when rock was young...and a young singer named Reginald Dwight a.k.a. Elton John exploded on the music scene with hit after hit after hit. Rocketman, an exuberant film biography of this musical legend, plays those hits too, as the film strings together the soundtrack of his life with varying degrees of success. Due mostly to a sensational performance by Taron Egerton in the title role, the musical interludes are performed and viewed very imaginatively, even if the storytelling is strictly mundane.Lee Hall's screenplay follows the contrived formula usually found in most bio-pics by showing the highs and lows of Elton John's personal story and expansive career: a child prodigy, unloving parents, a doting grandma, a caring music partner, a destructive relationship with his first lover/ manager, the typical drugs, sex, and rock and roll, etc. The story goes from Point A to Point B in a very predictable manner. The supporting characters are stock figures with little development and the writing never brings any depth to their motives or backgrounds. It expects the songs to tell the story in a most obvious way.Still, what sets this tired old cliché set-up apart from most bio-pics are the clever musical numbers that give the film a surreal and engaging quality. The songs are performed in no chronologic order. Instead they are the lead-ins and exposition to the many mercurial stages of the singer's life. This is strictly a juke box musical ala Mamma Mia, only much much better, with hints of The Who's Tommy thrown in at full throttle. The actors sing and dance their emotions through Mr. John's infectious music and Bernie Taupin's expressive lyrics, adding so much class to the film.And the whole concept mostly works.Yes, it's all too obvious and at times, overdone and excessive...but so is the man on stage. Director Dexter Fletcher knows how to stage his musical dream sequences and concert performances with the needed style and flourish. He also unflinchingly shows John's sexuality and does not sanitize these encounters as he did with the crowd-pleasing Freddy Mercury biography, Bohemian Rhapsody, which he previously co-directed. Special mention must also be paid to Julian Day's costumes which replicate John's iconic outfits with nostalgia and creative edginess.But it is Mr. Egerton, who does his own singing (a daring choice), and he captures the megastar's vocal intonations quite well. The actor delivers the emotional gravitas, especially in depicting Mr. John's abusive behavior. One hopes his performance will not be overlooked during award season. Jamie Bell plays John's writing partner, Bernie Taupin, and makes his character believable and real. As the villainous business manager / evil lover, Richard Madden tries to underplay this character with some degree of credibility, but the writing undoes his effort. Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh as Reginald's feuding mum and dad are wasted in their stereotypical roles.With an excellent lead performance by Mr. Egerton, Rocketman is always entertaining. Yet, while the film attains lift off, it just doesn't soar as high as it could.",Rocketman

Not The Same Music Impact for meSUMMARY:To recreate a living legend you have to hire the right person and Taron Egerton killed it with the recreation of Sir Elton John. The mannerisms, the look, and the showmanship are all captured brilliantly in his performance, playing the tormented soul that is the Rocketman. While the rest of the cast supports and plays their parts well, it is the focus on Egerton that draws everything into the movie. Hollywood brings the full arsenal of creation into the film, doing wonderful work on the make up as Elton ages, with not only facial changes but hair line. The recreation of his costumes mirror the performers quite well in terms of detail in all the spectacle that they were. Going along so well is an impressive set design and shooting locations that drop us back in time and places that he made famous. It's these special effects that help bring you into the full moment of the movie as well as increasing the spectacle of the numbers. Rocketman's musical numbers go on the trend of utilizing the song and dance routine typical of a musical and cueing them to potentially hint at the points/events of their creation. If you love those moments from High School Musical and show tunes of the theaters, then the numbers should get you real good, with similar techniques inspiring and highlighting some of his eccentric works. It's a different style compared to Bohemian, but the traditional route should get lovers of the genre smiling and potentially singing in glee. And to top it all off, this movie really hits one in the heart, as you learn about Elton's demons and the lessons he had to learn along the way. The ending in particular gave me goosebumps, and really puts a perspective on someone I never even remotely knew compared to all his numbers.
Yet, the thing about Rocketman is the approach they chose did not quite have the spunk and energy of Bohemian Rhapsody's melody. The pace is slow at times, drawing on the drama to fill the gaps rather than the comedy/energy of the numbers. For those who love the deep dive into the darker aspects of life, you've got it in this film, though I could have done more for the censorship myself, especially if it could have led to more concert and musical numbers. In addition, the analysis of overdramatic vs. real is always a question, especially given how the drama moments take a firm grasp on this movie. I myself like more of the musical spectacle and seeing that creative process, rather than getting downtrodden at the demons that plague us all. And while I appreciate these moments quite well, and attempt to learn from this, I missed the full-blown musical edge that I've gotten in some other films, especially because those numbers were not interrupted like in this film. As such, the numbers did not affect me as much as those in Bohemian Rhapsody, despite the mental moments they addressed.
Overall, Rocketman is a beautiful movie, focusing on the artistic side of things vs the full-blown concert relieving. Utilizing the pain and struggles of the artist, the movie is grounded in the plot of discovery, recovery, and all out creation from the motivations life throws at us. The special effects and showmanship will have musical numbers and John fans amazed, watching the recreation of the wonders unfold in modern day dynamics. As much as these moments moved me though, the movie is by far for those with a passion for the drama vs the music itself. Therefore, this movie is definitely a theater visit, but don't go in expecting a repeat of Bohemian in terms of straight up musical grandiosity, they may not quite enjoy this as much, especially when the numbers are interrupted. Still a fine musical biography to say the least and worth it for those who like Jersey Boys, Get Up Off That Thing, and musical numbers from theater.My scores are:Biography/Drama/Music: 8.0

83,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Rocketman,6,7 June 2019,"If Michael Gracey directed a musical a la the 1960's, 70's, 80's or early 90's, the result would be 2019's Rocketman (my latest review).Taron Egerton gives a committed (and raw ) performance as Rocketman's main lead and legendary musical icon, Sir Elton John. The only problem is he does the actual singing of Elton's jams and well, he's pitch-y and not much of a singer.In Rocketman, Elton John's life is chronicled from his distant childhood with his parents to his rise to stardom to his life-changing rehab stint in 1990. The film is rooted in fantasy, reality, trances, and scenes involving various characters breaking into song. I liked the actuality of the story but the fantasy elements and almost everything else zap Rocketman of having any sustained, dramatic momentum.Containing decent acting, a lot of splashy visuals, and a sort of combative narrative, Rocketman gets some of its timelines wrong just like in last year's Bohemian Rhapsody (""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" wasn't recorded before ""Bennie and the Jets"", ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"", and/or ""Honky Cat""). Plus, the movie doesn't rely on being credibly artsy and succumbs to having a saturated, candy coated TV feel.Still, Egerton dons glittery garb and gives it his all (despite looking more like a young Ewan McGregor than Elton John). And there's excellent supporting work by an almost unrecognizable Bryce Dallas Howard (she plays Elton's aloof mom, Sheila Eileen).Bottom line: I've been a fan of Elton John's music (and Bernie Taupin's lyrics) for pretty much my entire life. Their early stuff from the albums Tumbleweed Connection to Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is my vivid, euphonious childhood.Nimbly paced musically without giving the viewer ample time to breathe, Rocketman is a so-so tribute to Elton's long-lived life that could have done without the miscued, Greatest Showman treatment. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Rocketman
84,justin-fencsak,Great movie!!!,10,13 July 2019,"Fans of Elton John and biopics like Bohemian Rhapsody will enjoy this fantasy tale loosely based on true events about Elton John from his childhood until the 1980s, when he became huge on MTV. Very well done and moderately paced. See it on the big screen before it heads home!!!",Rocketman
85,Kingslaay,Decent,8,16 June 2019,"Another ambitious movie about one of the most talented and colorful people of our time. This is a sad and complex look at the life of Elton, how he struggled to love and be himself. The music is on point and never have I enjoyed so much music every 10 or so minutes, after all whose music is it. The acting is top notch, Taron Egerton shows he's got acting chops and he's supported very well by Jamie Bell. Also love the inclusion of so many great hits from Elton that we all love.We see Elton's tumultuous life come full circle when he emerges out of his meeting and embraces who he is. Some good additions could have been a Freddie cameo with Rami Malek reprising his role. This would have been a beautiful crossover. Or even George Michael and some Lion King. While was a well told and sad tale it could also have celebrated the music of such an icon. This may not be as good as Bohemian Rhapsody but it comes close.

86,vengeance20,Better than Bohemian Rhapsody,8,26 May 2019,"Seen this tonight & must say it was actually pretty good!The film tells the story of Elton John from when he was a child throughout to his adult life. It tells of the struggles & highs & lows he went through!The film was pretty decent! It enticed me in & kept me interested throughout!The only downside was the musical set up, I mean it wasn't really bad, but it let the film down a little!The films overall depiction was most realistic & more faithful than that of 2018's Bohemian Rhapsody which twisted & bent certain events. Bits were added on, parts were either over exaggerated or fictional & the film was sugar coated & made out to be sunshine & rainbows!Overall the film is good! The acting is spot on & the preferences were strong as ever! 8/10",Rocketman
87,denis888,Rocketman as another failed biopic.,3,10 August 2019,"Not so long ago, I wrote about the completely disastrous Bohemian Rhapsody, which showed us essentially a caricature of Freddie Mercury and the whole Queen group, and here on the screens is a new attempt to shoot a biography, this time - the story of the ups and downs of Sir Elton John. However, honestly speakings, I note that the filmmakers immediately warned everyone that ""Rocketman"" is not a biopic, but a musical fantasy based on the life of Reginald Dwight (after all, that's what Elton's name really is).
What did we see as a result? Two hours (now people just forgot how to make short films) gallop on the biography of Elton from the time of his early childhood until 1983. What is most unpleasant, the mere musical came out, and I can't stand the musicals. And when all people around suddenly start to sing and dance - people in a cafe, a crowd on the street, visitors in a gay bar, it becomes very funny and even uncomfortable to sit through. But the filmmakers could not sustain all two hours in the musical format. The film either breaks down into surrealistic fantasies (a scene in the pool), then gallops through 15 years of Elton's career (a scene with a rotating piano), then sharply slows down and becomes almost dead in the languid dialogues of John and Bernie Taupin. Speaking of Bernie. He himself is shown very accurately, but the nature of his collaboration with Elton is completely distorted. And when actor Jamie Bell, playing Taupin, begins to sing, my ears start to bleed right away.
But what about Taron Egerton, who plays Elton himself? Well, yes, he is very similar at times, especially in the scene with his mother in a restaurant, he sings ... well ... not bad, but he doesn't reach the level of John. And he overplays very much in drug scenes, in passion scenes with John Reid and in concert episodes. By the way, speaking of a gay topic - it is surprisingly minor in the film, there is, really not that much as one can expect. But the period of marriage to Renate Blauel is simply crumpled and slurred.
Another big disappointment is the complete absence of the plotline of musicians in Elton's band.Very smart rockers played there, and their participation in the arrangements was crucial. And in the film they are just, as it were, some long-haired comrades in the dressing room , or standing on the stage with guitars and drums - and that's all. Then they simply evaporate and then again appear from nowhere.
Well, the movie is not without actual errors, gentlemen. The presence of the guitarist at the early concerts was very funny (by then John had only himself, a drummer and a bass player in his band). It was very funny to hear the song of 1976 in 1970, and tunes of 1982 and 83 almost in 1969. And of course the most ridiculous thing was to think up that Reginald took his last name from John Lennon, and not from singer Long John Baldry. Well, yes, why go into the details of who this Baldry is, when the Beatles are here, and everyone knows them. Well, then why isn't there a concert sequebce featuring John Lennon? After all, he performed very cool there on the same stage with Elton.
What we get at the end line is a very chaotic and slim fantasy on Elton's excesses, the entire plotline with studio work is almost completely removed, concerts are shown on the surface level, albums are mentioned very briefly, and as a result, young viewers will have a lot of mess in mtheir heads after watching this movie.
My rating is 3 out of 10, only for the music and Egerton's efforts to sing. Well,a dn also for the classy depiction of the Bernie Tapin's part. Watch this movie once and forget.",Rocketman
88,fntstcplnt,Rocketman (2019),7,17 October 2019,"Directed by Dexter Fletcher. Starring Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell, Bryce Dallas Howard, Richard Madden, Stephen Graham, Charlie Rowe, Steven Mackintosh, Kit Connor, Tate Donovan, Celinde Schoenmaker, Matthew Illesley, Ophelia Lovibond. (R)The life and times of rock star Elton John (Egerton), told largely through flashback from a rehab group session. Not so much a biopic as a musical fantasy, allowing the film to cleverly avoid accusations of being a ""true story"" with numerous historical inaccuracies (which it certainly has), or being a formulaic jukebox musical that trots out loads of popular hits (which it certainly does); music and image have a life of its own here, shattering the constrains of reality, informing the emotion and experience of its flamboyant protagonist, and giving the familiar songs new context and fresh voice (Egerton did his own singing). The scene near the end with Elton confronting the ghosts of his past is crashingly obvious, and certain episodes are brushed over too hastily (his relationship with eventual wife of four years, Renate Blauel, comes out of nowhere and ends just as quickly). Egerton is sensational as the music legend, inhabiting the role enough to almost (but not quite) disappear inside it; Fletcher (who previously took over directing duties from Bryan Singer on a different gay British rock n' roll icon picture, the greatly inferior ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") stages several visually exciting musical numbers both onstage and off.70/100",Rocketman
89,arungeorge13,Egerton is simply magnificent in his portrayal of Elton John! [+68%],7,10 August 2019,"Six-line Review: The stand-out feature of this musical biopic is Egerton's stunning performance. He is ably supported by Jamie Bell, Richard Madden, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Dexter Fletcher's skills in visualizing the various tracks from EJ's discography warrants plaudits. Lee Hall's screenplay tries to point out how fame and wealth often come with their own share of emotional struggles, case in point being Elton John's life at his musical peak. While the film did come across as slightly self-indulgent at certain points, it redeems itself with a scene where EJ speaks his heart out to the folks who played key roles in his life. Again, none of it would have worked if not for Egerton's dedication.Verdict: Worth a watch!",Rocketman
90,Abdulxoxo,Doesn't know what it wants to be,5,21 July 2021,"Rocketman, tonally it's all over the place. When it comes to making films about musicians there are generally two choices that can be made. It can either be a drama, telling the story of the musician in a realistic way or it can be a jukebox musical, where the musician's music is used to shape a fictional narrative. In this case, the film try to tell Elton John's troubled life story within a jukebox musical; and it doesn't work. One of the elements that contributed to the issue with the film's tone was the directorial choices to have so many scenes which were surreal and frankly trippy. At one point an entire room was levitating. In another scene Elton was singing while underwater, with a child in a space helmet playing the keyboard. There are many other scenes equally as weird, and each time something like this happened it completely took me out of the movie. The problem is that this movie for the most part is not fun. It's actually really dark and depressing. If they wanted to tell such a dark story they should have made this a proper drama, not a musical. In terms of the performances, to be honest I didn't find them believable. Egerton had some good moments, but it never felt like he was Elton; he was always just Taron wearing silly outfits. The supporting cast were not very good either, apart from Jamie Bell, who played Elton's song writing partner Bernie. Richard Madden as Elton's manager came across as a one dimensional villain, with no interesting character traits. In the technical department, I thought the costume department did a tremendous job in finding/making outfits which resembled many of the iconic looks Elton sported over the years. The hair & makeup team on the work they put into the movie was fantastic. Visually, the characters looked great.",Rocketman
91,martimusross,Well Worth A Watch,6,22 May 2019,"RocketmanI really liked this movie, on the whole the dramatic impetus was supplied by Elton's chronology mirrored in the songs that were written at roughly the same time. It was quirky, inventive and showed an aspect of Elton, the national treasure.What was good,1, the music was fabulous and Taron Edgerton did a fine job, he really tried to reproduce both Elton's style and range.2, the ensemble playing was strong throughout and they seemed to gel well. I really liked the boss of the record company.3, the staged set pieces were brilliantly realised.What was not so good:1, it was never really explained why Elton's father rejected him, it inferred he was scarred by the war and left incapable of demonstrative behaviour or any depth of affection. And yet later in the movie he is a changed man, was he just a homophobe?2, there were several weak spots, I will detail two, when the song Saturday Night.. came on it seemed just shoe-horned into the movie, as happened in Mama Mia, it was just too contrived. The second was the gathering of family in the therapy group, if this was an epiphany moment it fell way short.3, the need to have flashbacks from a rehab group was just an unnecessary device and just did not work because he did not interact with the group in any real way.This was a great movie, certainly one for the fans, it won't win an Oscar but it was a jolly good night out.",Rocketman

The acting and singing are spot on, the cast is great and it just works. Enjoy, I know I did.",Rocketman
96,Jeremy_Urquhart,A good musical biopic that triumphantly steers clear of some clichés,7,25 February 2020,"So I'm a little late on Rocketman, but having recently watched Bohemian Rhapsody (and been slightly underwhelmed by it in many areas,) I'd heard Rocketman was a better alternative, and my interest in watching it went right up. It's overall not a perfect film, and indeed it's hard not to compare it a whole lot with the aforementioned Freddie Mercury/Queen biopic, but it is quite a good one. It's the kind of film where I loved aspects, found faults in some other areas, but came away from it feeling mostly pretty positive. The music biopic is one genre that can feel very clichéd and by the numbers, and while there are conventional parts to Rocketman's story, a good deal of the style and impressive musical numbers help give it a slight (and very welcome) fresh feel.Firstly, it's worth reiterating what everyone else has realised long ago and comment that Taron Egerton is great in the role of Elton John, and showed range as an actor that I for one wasn't aware he had. His performance was charismatic and always very engaging, and I was glad that it was his skill as an actor rather than just the costumes, hair, and makeup that made him so convincing as Elton John (although those all helped, of course). It's also worth mentioning that Richard Madden was also really good. I only know him as the heroic and sometimes a little bit boring Robb Stark from Game Of Thrones, and so to see him play a really despicable character here was surprising and refreshing. I think Madden's surprisingly good at playing a villain and I honestly hope he takes more roles as absolute sleaze balls in the future.The film really does shine during its imaginative and lively musical sequences, to the point where I kind of wish there had been more of them. I realise it would have been harder to tell a straightforward story if the film had been told entirely through the music of Elton John without lengthy and more traditional dialogue scenes in-between, but I think it's the kind of bold experiment that could have helped turn a good film like Rocketman into an absolutely great one. Those non-musical sequences aren't bad, but they are less consistent, with the pace often feeling too rushed, although it does help keep it from being boring. For an example, Elton John gets married at one point, to someone he just met, and then no more than two minutes later, they're already about to separate. It felt odd and rushed, and there were other scenes that gave me this sort of feeling. Pacing wise, perhaps a shorter window of time being covered could have helped, focusing in on just a few key moments in the subject's life like Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs from 2015 did, or maybe even made the film just 10-15 minutes longer, to allow the really fast scenes to breathe a little more.Also on the topic of the non-musical sequences: for me, they looked a little too bright, digital, and shiny. It makes more sense for the musical numbers to be similarly flashy and colourful, but for the scenes without musical numbers, it didn't work as well. While it's technically solid, I wish the film looked a little more 70s, as it really didn't evoke the time period very well (maybe it did with things like fashion and hairstyles, but not so much with the production design or technical aspects). They didn't have to shoot it like a typical 1970s film exactly, but if you look at how Tarantino shot his recent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it's done in a way that really evokes the time period without feeling exactly like a movie shot in the late 1960s. The colour, pacing, and more authentic locations all helped Tarantino's latest to truly feel like it was set when it was, and the shooting on actual film rather than digital cameras helped too (I wish Rocketman had employed a similar strategy). There is one moment where Egerton is digitally inserted into an old Elton John music video, and even though that video was colourful and flamboyant, it had a certain grit and graininess to it where you could really tell it was filmed around the time the film was set. I wish the film as a whole had taken a bit more inspiration from this original music video.The glossiness of the film's look in its non-musical sequences did occasionally clash with the darker, grittier story it sometimes tried to tell. However: I must say that overall I did really like how Rocketman was edgier and more direct with its depiction of a wild rock star lifestyle, which Bohemian Rhapsody frustratingly dialed down to an extreme degree. Rocketman wasn't over the top or overly graphic which was also good; it got the balance just right in showing things in a more intense, mature way, without being gratuitously shocking.I don't think you have to be an Elton John fan to like this movie, as I wouldn't describe myself as a huge fan (although I do absolutely love the 11-minute song 'Funeral For A Friend/ Love Lies Bleeding,' and was disappointed that no part of it found its way into this movie). I can imagine if you do love his music though that will help, and perhaps allow you to have a more favourable reaction than I did. The film paints what feels like a mostly honest yet still celebratory and sometimes joyful depiction of this iconic man's life and his music. It's quite good and does contain moments of greatness (mainly a few of those aforementioned musical sequences), so I could ultimately feel comfortable in giving it a solid recommendation to most filmgoers.",Rocketman
97,kevin c,Musical over biopic,7,17 November 2019,"Dexter Fletcher's has made a fun musical, but not an insightful biopic.

99,proud_luddite,A fine tribute to a great entertainer,7,23 July 2019,"Based on the life of Elton John: from childhood to a discovery of musical talent to superstardom to addiction to recovery, the episodes of Elton's life are dramatized with his famous songs used as a backdrop in the traditional musical form.""Rocketman"" has many similarities to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" released late last year: 1) both are about British men who were born in the late 1940s each with great talent; 2) both had attractions toward other men; 3) each was unfortunately involved with the despicable leech John Reid who also ""managed"" (aka manipulated) their careers in destructive ways; 4) both also reached great fame in the excessively wild 1970s; and 5) each had the inevitable fallout. A great difference is that while Freddie Mercury passed away in the 1990s, Elton John has survived the notorious traps of fame as he continues to perform after many decades in show business.Perhaps it is because ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was seen first, it had the greater impact. But ""Rocketman"" is still a powerful and enjoyable film. It is a fine tribute to one of history's most endearing and enduring entertainers. It is also a salute to Elton's inner-strength, humility and wisdom in knowing when to hit the breaks on a destructive life and the ability to see what really matters. And the chance to start again and win with a new life while still keeping the best of the old one. And kudos to Taron Egerton for his rich and touching performance. He even did his own singing in those spectacular musical numbers.With two recent movies exposing the evils of John Reid, maybe it is his turn for a biopic. ""Predator-Parasite"" would make a great title.",Rocketman
100,MadamWarden,Hater of musicals getting teary,8,3 June 2019,"I really do not like musicals. Poncing about to theatrically styled music is definitely not for me. Thus I was bowled over by this.

The right balance of fantasy and gritty reality.Truly memorable performances.And I wasn't embarrassed by my tears. 😅",Rocketman
101,drjgardner,Words and music,5,1 June 2019,"What seems to be forgotten in much of the talk about this film is that the words didn't come from Elton John but rather they came from his collaborator. Sometimes the songs are about Elton John as viewed by Bernie Taupin, and sometimes they are only about Taupin. Elton John put the words to music and he delivered them in a unique style, but the real ""personal"" side to the music is Bernie Taupin, not Elton John.That being said, this film makes it very clear that the words and thoughts are from Taupin so it's a wonder that very little is revealed about Taupin.Putting aside the neglect for the song writer, the film itself has some wonderful performances and some wonderful moments. But the attempt to turn it into a musical, albeit understandable, failed for me. Some of the musical numbers are just plain silly. I think the film would have been better as a bio with lots of music and the occasional musical freelance scene. Less would be more for my tastes.",Rocketman

104,PartialMovieViewer,Good Music and Seemed Too Long,3,19 November 2019,"I am a fan of Elton John's music, but after seeing this, I really don't care about his understated ups and overblown downs. The tendency to blame others for hurt feelings was cheep, while the outright grab at the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' spotlight, is tastelessly self-indulgent. The storyline really needed to be laid out better. I like high points and low points in movies, but this flick had way too many. One can't help but get exhausted jumping from peaks and valleys without warning - and this happened throughout the entire movie. It got to the point, at least for me, when the story reached one of the many tops of the ride, it shortly came crashing down to depressing angst and misery. I can't watch 'Rocketman' again, it's not that interesting. It's too bad too, this should have been an extremely interesting tale about a musical treasure - Elton John. It wasn't, it was humdrum. Just a suggestion; for an awesome personal story to be told about greatness, I highly suggest Martin Scorsese,",Rocketman
105,aciessi,Hold Me Closer,8,31 May 2019,"I think it's going to be a long, long time before we see another biopic as whimsical, freeing, high-flying and visually spellbinding as Rocketman. Everything this movie is, ultimately, is what Bohemian Rhapsody should have been. A flamboyant whirlwind, so fitting of the wonderful, colorful world of Elton John. You couldn't have made it any other way. True, it's a bit unusual to be making a musical biopic about a man that hasn't died, but Elton has lived so many lifetimes and lives, it's hard to imagine him leaving us anytime soon.Rocketman is a tapestry of Elton's life from childhood to his troubled, but decadent adulthood. What is revealed is how miserable a life he truly had. Dealing with a father who was never truly there for him, and a love life filled with so many grifters, it seemed as though he was never going to fill the emptiness of his heart. Artistic brilliance truly comes from grief, as Elton pours his feelings out into every last song. Listening closely to the lyrics, and along with Dexter Fletcher's impeccable cinematic structure, we realize how many of these catchy, unforgettable tunes represented Elton's loneliness and longing. We also explore Elton's many unfortunate addictions. Drugs, sex and alcohol kept him at bay, until they nearly killed him. I got a kick out of how the film was crafted along the confines of an intervention, populated not only by Elton's many lovers, loved ones and acquaintances, but the many versions of himself.Not to mention, Rocketman is a jukebox musical on steroids. All the hits are here, and the entire cast has a swinging time performing them all. Shouldn't all musical biopics be like this? For my money, this is a nice change of pace from how formulaic and tiresome some biopics have become these days.",Rocketman
106,rockman182,Rocketman (2019),7,2 June 2019,"Based on a true fantasy. I heard some great stuff about this film and it peaked my interest. I know that Dexter Fletcher filled in to direct the final weeks of Bohemian Rhapsody but for me this felt like his first true musical biopic I didn't like Bohemian Rhapsody all that much outside of the music and Rami Malek. I'm glad to say that Rockeman is substantially better. Its well acted, well curated, and is even in nature. Its something that's welcome as far as the quality of musician biopic's go.The film starts off with Elton John in therapy where he tells the story of how he got addicted to alcohol and drugs, primarily cocaine. We see the story of Elton's youth, originally known as Reginald and how he grew up in a loveless household. He goes far with his natural gift but the pain of his past and his current affairs drive him off the deep end. Still, the talented musicianship remains and the film shows the journey of the highs and lows of Sir Elton John's life.The film is a musical in nature, as characters burst into song spontaneously, throughout the film. Taron Egerton brings a surprisingly great performance as Elton and brings the bombastic nature and all the intricacies of John to screen. He is really good in this. The music, all sang by Egerton himself also shows how much work was put into this. Fletcher's film captures the magic of the music and the showman while also showing the dark stages of his life and the impact that substance abuse have on his well being.The film follows the biopic formula, yet it does so fairly uniquely with its presentation in musical format and its connecting imagery. Its a colorful film and does a lot in its run time. Its a good time to be had whether you are familiar with Elton's work or not. It'll probably be a long long time till we see another biopic about a musician that is actually competent. Rocketman most certainly exceeded my expectations. Its the best film of the new releases this week at the cinemas.7.5/10",Rocketman
107,jon.h.ochiai,"""Rocketman"" - I'm Not the Man You Think I Am",9,8 June 2019,"In wistful eloquence, Director Dexter Fletcher captures Taron Egerton's Elton John composing his signature ""Your Song"" donned in bathrobe, playing the piano in his Mother's living room. Elton's dear friend lyricist Bernie Taupin, played by Jamie Bell, listens in enchanted wonder. Glancing at Bernie, Elton sings: ""My gift is my song and this one's for you..."" Elton is gay. Bernie is straight. ""Your Song"" is my very favorite Elton John song, since I was a teen. It never occurred to me: Was that Elton's love song for Bernie?Throughout much of his life, Elton experienced the ""slings and arrows"" of Rock Star fortune: illicit drugs, overdoses, and wanton gratuitous sex. In Director Dexter's musical bio fantasy ""Rocketman"", music icon Elton's tragedy may have sourced from the frightened lonely boy, who just wanted to be loved.Dexter Fletcher took over as director for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", the rock group Queen bio pic about the late legendary Freddie Mercury, when Director Bryan Singer was fired by the studio. Both Freddie and Elton are gay men, who suffered in inauthentic self-expression. In familiar ""Rocketman"" affinity, Dexter creates touching compassion amidst the absurdity of prejudice. Dexter wisely infuses the offbeat sense of humor.Taron is courageous vulnerability and resilience as tortured Elton, born Reginald Dwight. Taron awes in his vocal renditions of Elton John classics like ""Rocketman"" and ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"". As song lyricist partner Bernie, Jamie Bell embodies gentle wisdom and affection. He's Elton's only enduring friend. Bernie confesses to Elton, ""I love you man. I really do. Just not like that.""Paradoxically, that 'incomplete' love evolves as fate. At the narrative arc, Elton tells his emotionally bankrupt Mother Sheila, played by haunting Bryce Dallan Howard, that he's homosexual. She says, ""You will never be loved properly."" That too, becomes Elton's sentence.In the mural of fantastical sexual and musical narrative excess, Screenwriter Lee Hall poignantly constructs Elton's transformation as he begins to heal and love himself. Albeit clumsily, like the musical number emerging in Elton's dinner with his Mom and her boyfriend Fred, played by whimsical Tom Bennett. Yet, we still hold out hope that Elton discovers his measure of joy and peace.In flashbacks, Elton grew up in a dysfunctional English family. His Dad Stanley, dispassionate and disinterested Steven Mackintosh, is rarely home because of his work. When he is home, he listens to jazz, but not to his son. Elton's Mom tolerates her loveless marriage. In the aftermath stands young Reggie, played by bright innocent Matthew Illesley. Also Dad had never hugged his own son.Reggie is the gifted piano prodigy. He gets a musical scholarship to the Royal London Academy. His family spirals in demise. His parents divorce. Eventually, Reggie forms a band and tours with a Black Rhythm and Blues band, which reveals his soulful music roots. Furthering his music career, Reggie changes his name to Elton John. In apparent divine intervention Elton, the brilliant composer, who can't write a lyric, hooks up with lyricist Bernie Taupin. Elton and Bernie would emerge as one of the greatest songwriting duos of the 20th century.Alas, the downside of fame and fortune. Duplicitous John Reid, played with mercenary charm by Richard Madden, seduces innocent Elton. John insinuates his way into his life as Elton's business manager. Elton and Bernie continue to create prolific songs, as Elton succumbs into the abyss of addiction and depression with his eyes wide open.In an interview years ago, Elton said when he first started working with Bernie, he thought the words were superfluous. What mattered was the melody. That's what determined a great song. Years later, he got that words defined the song. Words resonated with the soul. Music and lyrics were like Yin and Yang for a song.Perhaps, the narrative failing of ""Rocketman"" is its resolution. We know that Elton John in real life emerged from the darkness. He's in love, has a family. Recently, he announced his retirement from touring. Amen, good for Elton. The ending needed its own ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"".That being said, I got ""Rocketman"" in the bigger picture. Much like Elton may have written ""Your Song"" for Bernie. Perhaps, Bernie wrote the song ""Rocketman"" for Elton. He wrote: ""I'm not the man you think I am at home... Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone."" Elton was all alone. He just wanted to be gotten, to be loved. In that way, we can see a little of ""Rocketman"" in all of us, too.",Rocketman
108,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A disjointed biography that checks off all the tired tropes.,6,14 March 2020,"After the critical success of Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), it felt like the market was ripe for another movie about a homosexual piano-playing musician. Enter Rocketman (2019), a biopic about Elton John (Taron Egerton) that didn't quite know what to do with itself. Was it supposed to be the greatest hits of Elton John songs, like Mamma Mia! (2008) was for ABBA? If it was intended as a straight biography of Elton's life, it falls into all the tropes that seem to be requirements for the genre. There didn't seem to be anything original here other than sex, drugs, and rock and roll.One aspect of Elton John's rise to stardom that I found interesting was his ability to pick up and play any song after hearing it once. This skill is quite a rare trait, and I almost wished this film played up that aspect a little more. I also was intrigued to learn that, while Elton was great at playing the piano, he needed someone to come up with the lyrics for him. Again, it is a great talent to be able to put words to music, which felt like a missed opportunity that was set aside in favor of focusing on Elton's homosexuality and drug abuse.I understand that these issues doesn't help tell the ""tortured artist"" narrative. Still, when the songs themselves don't integrate well into the story, I felt that Rocketman was too disjointed to make any sense. If you took the songs as well-choreographed music videos, then they'd be great to watch individually. However, they usually stray from the main point of the story when they start, and they don't seamlessly work themselves back into the plot without some sort of clunky transition. Still, like how Yesterday (2019) was a bland realization of a great idea, at least it and Rocketman contain some excellent musical scores.A disjointed biography that checks off all the tired tropes, I give Rocketman 3.0 stars out of 5.",Rocketman
109,RforFilm,"Rocketman is a real ""Rocket Man"", as it soars for a fun musical and shows that will ""Still Stand"" for a while",8,17 June 2019,"When going to a concert, are we seeing the ""singer"" or the ""show""? This may seem like an odd question, but it makes sense when considering what exactly were watching. We're not there to listen to some songs, but there to experience them as done by it's creator. Chances are their not just going to sing them, but also incorporate dancers, videos, lighting, costume, and perhaps more. A lot of singers/bands will do this to make their fans feel like their witnessing an experience. I've been to plenty myself that have included Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and Metallica. One of the biggest proprietors of this happens to be pianist Elton John.While I'm not a regular listener of his music, I will say that Elton John is a talented singer/rocker who's created some songs I like, including ""Crocodile Rock"", ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", and ""I'm Still Standing"". I've always seen him as the modern day Liberace, who happens one of the few famous piano players and also loves to incorporate a lot the theatrical costumes into his shows. I recall learning about him when I first saw The Lion King in 1994, but knew very little about the singer himself. It all comes front and center in Rocketman.At a rehab facility, a fully costumed Elton John (played by Taron Egerton) admits to being addicted to a lot of things and proceeds to tell his life story. Cut back to his childhood, he was raised as ""Reginald Dwight"" by his mother Shelia (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) and grandmother Ivy, as his father is largely absent and uninterested in his son. It's apparent right away that ""Reginald"" is a prodigy with a perfect musical year and becomes good enough to receive a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. He trains further and further while gaining an interest in rock artists like Elvis.He joins a variety of bands until he tries to make it on his own. Inspired by on of the bands he plays for, he changes his name to Elton John and forms a partnership with songwriter Bernie Taupin (played by Jamie Bell). The two get along, but Elton realizes that he himself is gay. Regardless, his first show in Los Angeles makes him an immediate star. Elton eventually starts a romantic relationship with his new manager John Reid (played by Richard Madden), but starts his addiction to drugs, sex and alcohol.I'll say that Rocketman is the movie that I had hoped Bohemian Rhapsody was going to be. It's informative, emotional, and most importantly, very entertaining. The biggest difference is that unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which was a traditional biography, Rocketman is more of a fantasy-like musical, which incorporates his songs into his life story. The result feels like as if it's Elton John' story as told by him. I have no idea if this is close (this feels like it has to be) to what happened, but the filmmaker understood that it was more important to make a unique movie then anything.A lot of that is on Taron Egerton who does a fantastic job playing Elton John. Along with understanding the pressure the real singer went through, he also translates the flamboyance into something that resonates two meanings: escape and expression. Another screenplay probably would have made him one note. Rocketman allows Taron to express the various sides to come out just to show how complicated Elton was. I'll bet a million dollars that he'll get an academy award nomination for his performance. Perhaps we'll have two years of actors playing musicians winning awards.Is the movie grand? I though it was certainly very good. When the movie drifts into the drugs and alcohol territory, it does stray a little longer then needed. While I know Elton John did go through a lot of abuse, it's something I've seen a lot of rock star movies already do a lot. I might have been kinder had it focused on his sex addiction, which is rarely seen in movies. At best, Rocketman needed at least fifteen minutes trimmed so that the pacing feels a bit quicker. Regular movie goers probably wont see this as an issue and should have fun regardless.I'll give this eight flamboyant glasses out of ten. Rocketman is a real ""Rocket Man"" as it soars and shows it's audience an experience they could never experience at any of his shows. It's a fun musical and it'll ""Still Stand"" for a long time.",Rocketman
110,eminkl,It's a nice musical,7,10 October 2019,Falls victim to many of the usual biopic cliches and the ending is a little too romantic but it's a nice musical anchored by the success of Egerton for a long time.,Rocketman
111,bankofmarquis,Strong lead performance,8,11 June 2019,"I have to admit, I thought the Freddy Mercury bio-pic BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY was just ""meh"" and that Rami Malek was ""just o'k"" as the Queen frontman (personally, I would have given the Oscar to Christian Bale for his portrayal of Dick Cheney in VICE) so I was not rushing to the multi-plex to check out the Elton John musical film ROCKETMAN. And the fact that the release of this film was ""buried"" in the summer and not right before ""Oscar Season"" gave me room to pause.And...I would be wrong...for ROCKETMAN is a fun, fantastical fantasy musical depicting the rise and fall (by drug and alcohol abuse) of one of rock's most flamboyant showman of the 1970's.Following the ""Jukebox Musical"" blueprint of something like JERSEY BOYS, Rocketman follows a young Reggie Dwight as he discovers his musical talent and grows into the Global Superstar known as Elton John.I was happy that the filmmakers went this route (vs the bio-pic route that BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY went) for they were able to use the vast catalog of Elton John/Bernie Taupin tunes to their fullest advantage, when it made sense to drive the narrative forward - or to give the storytelling a shot of adrenaline.This film had Elton John's blessings and he was not kind to a few people in his life - most notably his mother (an almost unrecognizable Bryce Dallas Howard in a strong turn), his father (Steve Mackintosh, who I had never seen before) and his Manager, John Reid (Game of Throne's Richard Madden). All 3 are pretty one-dimensional villains that help contribute to Elton's drug and alcohol abuse.On the other side of the coin is his writing partner, Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell, the original BILLY ELLIOT in a performance that I think is the best of his career) and his Grandmother, Ivy (good ol' Gemma Jones BRIDGET JONES DIARY and Madam Pomfrey in the Harry Potter films). Both of these characters are generally positive influences on Elton's life, trying to understand and support our hero on his journey.As for our hero, Taran Egerton (the KINGSMAN films) embodies Elton with panache and zeal while showing an underlying shyness and insecurity that helps lead to his abuse issues. Egerton is EXCELLENT in this role - both in acting and singing. He doesn't so much imitate Elton John but embodies the essence of Sir Elton and his performance is quite effective. If Rami Malek deserved his Oscar for playing Freddy Mercury in BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY then Taran Egerton better be in the Oscar conversation this year.The film was Directed by Dexter Fletcher (who was brought on to finish BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY once Bryan Singer was fired from that film for his on-set behavior), so he puts to good use his experience on the Queen movie, keeping the action moving fast, the characterizations simple (but satisfying) enough while showcasing just enough music to fill a ""Best of"" Album.While BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY was a ""meh"" movie with a buffo ending (the recreation of the LIVE AID concert was amazing), ROCKETMAN suffers from just the opposite problem. Starting off strong and growing weaker until it ends in ""meh"" fashion. The fact that this film musical fantasy decided to end with a faithful recreation of the I'M STILL STANDING music video is at the heart of the issue. I understand the implied underlying meaning of this song selection, but it just doesn't pack the punch that a live concert appearance would have.Come for the music, stay for Egerton's performance and you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Rocketman
112,Anurag-Shetty,Heartbreaking yet uplifting.,9,3 June 2019,"Rocketman is a biopic about Elton John(Taron Egerton). It focuses mainly on Elton John's early years, in the music industry.Rocketman is an amazing film. Director Dexter Fletcher has given us an accurate & no holds barred account of Elton John's life. None of the various aspects of Elton John's life are sugar-coated, in any way. The dramatic set pieces & the set pieces featuring Elton's songs, have been beautifully balanced throughout. The visuals are unique & mind-blowing. I liked the other recent music biopic Bohemian Rhapsody(2018), a little bit better than this. One flaw is that none of Elton John's iconic songs, are in the movie in their entirety. The performances are top-notch. Taron Egerton is spectacular as Elton John. Egerton gives the best performance of his career & deserves several award nominations, for his absolutely spot-on portrayal. Jamie Bell is brilliant as Bernie Taupin. Richard Madden is outstanding as John Reid. Bryce Dallas Howard is fantastic as Sheila. Gemma Jones, Steven Mackintosh, Tom Bennett & Charlie Rowe are great as Ivy, Stanley, Fred & Ray Williams, respectively. Matthew Illesley & Kit Connor are superb as Young Reggie & Older Reggie, respectively. The entire cast, especially Egerton, has sung magnificently. Rocketman is a must watch for Elton John fans. Go & be blown away!",Rocketman
113,agmoldham,Slightly disappointed,6,18 June 2019,"I had high hopes for Rocketman to be my film of the year so far. Unfortunately it failed to live up to those expectations.The film focuses on Elton John's formative years via way of flashbacks in a rehab meeting. Never been a big fan of his music, but there's certainly some classic tunes in his back catalogue. Taron Egerton plays Elton with Jamie Bell playing his sidekick Bernie Taupin. There's no doubt that both leads and Egerton in particular put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into their roles. Although it didn't quite live up to expectations it's still a pretty entertaining watch. Have seen a few press clips saying that some of the content isn't 100% accurate. There is no doubt that this is the way that Elton John feels about his early years, so it's therefore reflecting those feelings.I wasn't aware that this was a musical production, so if you are not a fan of actors bursting into song you are probably best advised to give this one a miss.",Rocketman
114,jrarichards,Moving and meaningful biopic that takes its supremely innovative mix of fantasy and grim reality into the realms of high art,10,26 June 2020,"Those watching Dexter Fletcher's ""Rocketman"" without much background info are going to wonder quite early on if this presentation of the (younger) life of ""Elton Hercules John"" (otherwise Reginald Dwight of Pinner, Greater London) is unauthorised, or comes with its hero's approval. A quick look at the credits (in my case only post-film) reveals that it does (he's an Executive Producer), and that Elton's husband David Furnish is a Producer.The reason for the doubt is that the tale we see of Elton as the rising star and then superstar is an often-grim business in which the portrayal is of no excess left untried. It begins mid-life with a group therapy/AA session at which a GREAT Taron Egerton as Elton sums up his numerous vices in a brief, impassioned bout of self-loathing; and this is then developed for many a long minute in the movie, which intertwines quite remarkably and with great artistry with theatre-musical-like choreography, colour, pseudo-joy and many of ""those"" songs.Elton John was a superstar - but those of us with long memories back to the 70s remember him as the ""older-looking guy"" (who wasn't, given that he was doing good stuff by age 20) - who always seemed pretty serious under all that flamboyance. This is writ large here, as the ""smile still goes on"" when he appears on stage, only to be switched off the moment he leaves it.Anyway, if we had that instinct about Elton John even back in the day, it was a sound instinct, since the film brings us layer upon layer of superficial and meaningless success, all concealing and obscuring an ordinary, introverted man from an ordinary background (at times stiflingly so), yet with an extraordinary musical talent worthy of the Royal Academy of Music - of which Elton is a Licenciate.Maybe blaming parents is a copout, but the scenes of Elton the child interacting with those around him are superb and poignant. As Elton has I believe said, there was nothing outright cruel going on, and his talent WAS recognised and fostered, but our hero needed more than that, and seems not to have got it at all. One of the film's numerous flights of utter fancy (that contrast regularly with some VERY down-to-Earth stuff more typical of biopics) has Elton the kid seek - at long last, and as a substitute for a parental version - a hug of approval from Elton the star. This is just one of the many moments when the makers take their film to a sublime and heady height of artistic emotion and true film-making skill. They bring regular tears to the eye and engender a profound mix of sympathy and censure in the viewer.A perhaps-oversimplified (but immensely powerful) aspect of the story is the one that contrasts Bernie Taupin - Elton's Lincolnshire-born (implacably and resolutely non-sexual) partner on the lyrics (as played TREMENDOUSLY by Jamie Bell) with that of John Reid (well-played by the famous Richard Madden), who is theoretically Elton's liberater as his gay lover - but seems more into lust than love, and with that lust soon turning more towards money to be made. This is especially ironic, as Bell's Taupin tells Egerton's John repeatedly that he loves him (but not in that way) - and both the portrayal and the real-life story suggest that this is the case. In truth, Reid was no slouch, as he also managed Queen and Michael Flatley; and it may be that the portrayal is too harsh. But then, ultimately this is Elton's film; and he knows!The fact that this IS Elton-authorised denotes that the absolutely honest-looking, negative presentation of his life MUST be leading somewhere, and that is so as the climactic message is of a mid-life man finally out of crisis and into ... for example ... raising $450M (!!) for AIDS charities. Princess Diana gets no mention (though - again with SUPERB poignancy - we do see a mini-bit of ""Candle in the Wind"" emerge on the piano decades before it was actually given effect to).Those of us out here in audience-land are indeed shouting at the screen that - even if the man absolutely cannot help himself - he has the means to help others who might do more and better with (even a tiny fraction) of the fortune than he does. But that is of course EXACTLY what Elton Hercules John did do.He made a genuine hero (even an occasional wise sage) of himself, and somehow in the process did calm down and live the more meaningful, also truly quieter, life he clearly always craved and was cut out for. All credit for that, and all credit too for a masterly film of many component aspects being made out it...",Rocketman
115,allanmichael30,A Roller Coaster of Emotions,8,29 December 2019,It's one of the best biopics I have ever seen and a joy to watch.

Pehaps they could make a sequel.,Rocketman
116,bob-the-movie-man,Watford Rhapsody.,10,8 June 2019,"I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody very much - I really did. But I did get some stick for not giving it the full 10*'s: I gave it9*'s (which is still pretty good for me!). I think my main reservation was the sanitisation of Mercury's life. With ""Rocketman"" - a full-on musical based on the life of Reggie Dwight (aka Elton John) - the word sanitised doesn't enter into it!It's an extraordinary life story. As a child, Reg had a talent - very nicely demonstrated in the film - for hearing a piece of music once and being able to reproduce it. As a teenager Reg (now played by Taron Egerton) meets Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), and a writing partnership of the quality of Lennon and McCartney is formed.Dick James (Stephen Graham, so brilliant in Season 5 of ""Line of Duty"") is Elton's original manager, dismissive about many of the songs but canny enough to see the potential and send the pair to LA for a shot at fame. There Elton meets the gay empressario John Reid (""Bodyguard's"" Richard Madden) and a business and personal relationship drives Elton into megastardom. But that all comes at a cost, as drink, drugs and sex become addictive.The star turn is Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton. It's extraordinary. It's so brilliant because its not really an impersonation: by the end of the film, he just *is* Elton. When we hear some of his classic songs, most notably his 'recording' of ""Your Song"", it's the Taron Egerton version that you hear... not some slavish attempt to recreate the single. And Egerton can sing!But while Egerton deservedly gets a lot of the praise, he is supported by some really solid supporting performances: most notably Jamie Bell and Richard Madden. Bell's Taupin is a quiet supporting figure, never over-stepping his brief: he's arguably a bigger star than Egerton. Madden on the other hand - probably breaking womens' hearts the length of the country - has steamy sex scenes with Egerton but is otherwise fantastic portraying the controlling monster Reid.Whis is surely a contender for a Costume Oscar. TThe costume department have a whale of a time with this film. But, after all, they have a huge back-catalog of historically outrageous material to work with! It's all brilliantly done by costume designer Julian Day, and adds greatly to the style and dynamics of the film.Showing great directorial flair is Dexter Fletcher, famous for coming in and 'saving' ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" after a less than easy initial shoot with Bryan Singer. Here he's got full control from the get-go, and it shows. The opening of the film is a memorable entrance to a therapy session, and the use of that environment to frame the story is simply brilliant.It's also not really a biopic with music but a musical framing a biopic. This might come as a shock to ""La La Land"" haters! But it's intriguing that - apart from some of the historical releases that frame the story - all of Elton's hits are scattered through the film without regard to release date. It's comical to see the reaction of Dick James to 90's hits back in the 70's!Talking of which, another highspot is the memorable video for ""I'm Still Standing"" with Egerton cleverly CGI'd in.The film is a UK 15-certificate, so if you are prudish, prepare to be offended by the homosexual sex and drugs usage. Elton recently commented that ""I haven't led a PG-13 rated life,"" and he pushed that the film should not be diluted to appeal to a broader rating. That's a good decision.An occasional feature of my blog are sightings of my son-in-law's brother, Paul Jones, who does a lot of film extra work. He's in ""Rocketman"" but it's not an obvious appearance! During recording of Elton playing ""Bennie and the Jets"", a call went out to the extras as to whether anyone could play the piano. Paul's hand went up first, so those are Paul Jones' hands - gaudy rings and all - playing the keys!This will undoubtedly make my Top 10 of the year. I loved it. It's got all the heart of BoRhap, but has 10 times the soul. If you've not seen it yet, I heartily recommend it. How long will it be before I see another music biopic this good? I think it's gonna be a long long time...",Rocketman

118,mikayakatnt,Could have been much better,6,13 July 2020,"Imagine the near-impossible task of creating an epic biopic that fully captures the over-the-top eccentricity and energy that is Elton John. And Taron Egerton did a dang good job.Disclaimer: I'm a big fan of Elton John. Yet, I'll do my best to keep my admiration of his music separate from this movie.Rocketman tells a half-fantastical, half-true story of the life of Elton John. It's more of a surrealist fantastical musical than a to-the-point accurate portrayal of his life. But, maybe it's better that way.The music numbers hit all the right spots. Performed out-of-order from the times Elton John is alive, Rocketman aims more for style than accuracy.Sound design and costume design are true to Elton John's nature and the entire team deserves praise for their hard work.And did I mention Taron Egerton's amazing vocal performance?Yet, my admiration for this movie stops there. The portrayal of this movie is told from a flashback perspective while Elton John is in rehab. We start the film from the present (rehab) and hop back and forth between the past & present. Though a fan of everything else about this movie, I found this method of storytelling is lazy, overdone, and uninteresting.Time is not fluid in this film as years and months are blended in this film and everything seems handed down to John. It's confusing and a disservice.Shame, as this movie was missing that one special ""pow"" that takes it to the next level.3/5. Seems that the film was more interested in capturing the magic from Bohemian Rhapsody than capturing the magic of Elton John's life. If more thought was done on the script and plot, this movie could have flown as high as a Rocketman.",Rocketman
119,kjproulx,A Biopic that feels fresh and original,9,3 June 2019,"When it comes to biopics, the majority of them follow a specific formula that will bring the audience from point A to point B in a way that feels very familiar. Most of the time that formula feels tired and makes for a very boring theatrical experience, so I was very excited to see that Rocketman would be taking a slightly different approach. Although it does follow many of the tropes that these biopics surrounding addicted artists follow, it does feel very fresh and presents a fun way to look at a downer story like Rocketman. Here's why it's absolutely worth your time.Telling you right off the bat that Elton John eventually developed addictions to many different substances, including emotional struggles, the film flashes back to begin with him at a very young age when he first touched the piano. Slowly going through his life until he reaches his breaking point (which is, of course, the climax), Rocketman is a very engaging film, due to the fact that it really is a musical fantasy at times, providing thought-provoking sequences that really dive deep into the meanings of a few of his hit songs. From the way certain things are presented visually to the spin that Taron Edgerton himself put on these classic songs, there was so much to love here.Speaking of Taron Edgerton, I've always been impressed by his acting chops. Whether playing a likeable crazy man in Eddie the Eagle or being a kick-ass action star in the Kingsman films, his career has been on an upward trajectory. Not in terms of box office returns, but absolutely within his performances. I've seen him improve over the years, but never did I expect to be as amazed by him as I was when watching Rocketman. Not only does he personify Elton John in a perfect way, but also brings a massive depth of drama to the role, solidifying him as one of the best actors out there today. If this movie doesn't get him any nominations by the end of this year, I fear it will be a long time before he delivers a performance this good.Director Dexter Fletcher was someone I was keeping my eye on after his work on Eddie the Eagle, which also starred Taron Edgerton in the title role. His direction on that film was very inspired and the overall movie was quite enjoyable, so I was hoping for at least another feel-good movie that he would sink his teeth into. Well, this is more than I could have ever asked for. His direction here and how the story is presented in general had me smiling from start to finish. Rocketman stands out from the crowd as being different in all the best ways.In the end, Rocketman is a fun, emotional, and at times deep ride from start to finish. From the insanely good musical numbers to Edgerton's incredible performance, from the emphatic soundtrack to the grand visuals, everything about this movie felt inspired. This will probably go down as one of the best, if not the best biopic of 2019. Rocketman deserves a large audience and I think those who seek this one out will find a lot to like unless for some reason musicals turn you off. If you're someone who doesn't find any enjoyment whatsoever when watching a musical, then this one may not be for you. For me, I loved watching this one.",Rocketman
120,AhmedSpielberg99,"It could have flew high as a kite, but it just slightly rose above the ground!",6,4 September 2019,"Elton John is one of my all-time favourite singers, so there's no need to say how much I was excited for this film. I also like Taron Egerton so much. I think he's one of the most talented young actors working today. My expectations were as high as a kite. The only thing I was concerned about is that this film is directed by Dexter Fletcher, the same man who was behind the abysmal Queen biopic. But what made Bohemian Rhapsody this bad is its troubled production anyway, right? Not really!The first half is almost as perfunctory as Bohemian Rhapsody, and the second half is almost as messy as Bohemian Rhapsody. And it still has many outdated techniques that were used to force more events into sequences and make them more brief. Actually, it sounds as if Fletcher used here the same exact formula he used to make Bohemian Rhapsody. But these flaws can be partially justified this time by the fact this film doesn't intend to tell a story that captures the highs and lows of the artist, but rather to express them through the semi-fantastical approach it takes to tell its story. But there are also two major problems here that hindered the film to fully compensate for its shallow characters, clichés and messy structure.I'm glad that Fletcher took some risks here. He tried to visually express Elton John's inner turmoil. He tried to tell his story of ups and down surrealistically using Elton's point of view. The thing is I couldn't even see there are ups and down; they are all downs. I believe that was intentional because the filmmakers knew that the plot is dramatically poor.I think the fantastical elements don't add much to neither the story, nor the protagonist. Mostly, they ended up being nothing more than gimmicks. I believe no one can deny it was pretentious decision, and that Fletcher's ambition obviously exceeds his grasp by taking this decision besides using some other narration techniques.However, I was quite entertained. Honestly, I think I never had a moment of boredom throughout the film's two-hour runtime! Mostly due to Egerton's powerhouse performance that definitely should earn him an Oscar nod. Jamie Bell who played Elton's writing partner, Bernie Taupin, is also great. I can say the same about all the actors and actresses in this film except for Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintoshwho played Elton's mother and father respectively. I know that it's their skin-deep, archetypal characters who are to blame, but I simply couldn't stand their appearances on the screen.The second reason I enjoyed this film is that pretentious its narrative style as it is, I felt that it added some frequent and refreshing glimpses to an otherwise formulaic story that tries to conceal itself under the glitz and glamour of the irresponsible Elton John.Finally, the third reason I kinda liked this film is that despite its glaring lack of dramatic heft, I found some rather emotional moments here and there that touched me quite a bit.Rocketman really had potential to be a great, rather than an OK, film, if it was made by more efficient filmmakers. That said, I believe it's still better than Bohemian Rhapsody. I mean, at least it didn't make me stop listening to Elton John's songs!(6/10)",Rocketman
121,tm-sheehan,Nearly snuffed out like A Candle In The Wind- This Phoenix Rose Again,9,25 May 2019,"Rocketman- My Review 9/10This movie is a celebration of a talented life saved from the brink of death due to addiction.It's a joyful romp tinged with drama and sadness and much more like a musical which and I predict it will eventually become a Stage musical.The musical numbers and fantasy are choreographed beautifully and it's no coincidence that Sir Elton John as Executive Producer and creator of the musical Billy Elliott has assembled a superb cast including the original star of the 2000 film of Billy Elliott Jamie Bell who is outstanding as Elton's music partner Bernie Taupin.Taren Edgerton, is superb as Elton John and unlike Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody sings all Elton's great hits himself.Director Dexter Fletcher knows how to make a biography interesting and entertaining without seeming like a documentary.Dexter Fletcher was bought into finish the troubled Bohemian Rhapsody in 2018 after Bryan Singer was fired.
Rocketman is a very different style to Bohemian Rhapsody which had a more documentary feel at times .The movie 🎥 definitely reminded me of two musicals The Boy from Oz and Billy Elliott,especially the childhood scenes and Matthew Illesley as young Elton is very impressive as is Gemma Jones as Ivy ,Elton's grandmother ,who I'm sure the Grandmother in Billy Elliott is based on ,she has ""baggage.""
The entire cast are impressive,especially Richard Madden who plays Elton's manager / opportunist lover in the dark days of Elton's decline from Addiction.Lee Hall the scriptwriter, who's previous film scripts include Billy Elliott, Victoria and Abdul and War Horse has managed to portray the great emotion and sadness of Elton's life then contrasts this with the exhilarating climb to stardom in Elton's early career which later turns to betrayal,despair and loneliness when his life is nearly snuffed out by addiction ""Like a Candle in the Wind.We know the ending because Elton John is still very much alive and preparing for his retirement world tour .
He has a happy marriage to partner David Furnish and two children Zachary and Elijah.Nothing like a happy ending ,especially when his mother says in the movie after Elton tells her he is gay that she doesn't care but he'll spend his life never being loved and lonely..",Rocketman
122,brankovranjkovic,Rocketman - Musical Genius to Rock 'n' Roll Mega-star.,10,26 May 2019,"Musical drama, based on the incredible true story of Elton John.Directed by Dexter Fletcher, who also directed Bohemian Rhapsody.Follows the life of Reginald Dwight (Elton's real name), from his early life via numerous flashbacks, to music prodigy. His difficult relationship with his parents (particularly is father). How he meets Bernie Taupin and their collaborative journey through to Elton's rise to become one of the most famous mega rock-stars on the planet. His relationship with John Reid, his first manager, his first serious homosexual lover but in the end how this turns into purely a business relationship.There are many emotional scenes many involving the difficult relationship with his parents, particularly his very distant father, who leaves to begin a new family. Elton is at the height of fame, he visits his father's new family but is rejected again - this is deeply emotional and for me is the 'Oscar' worthy moment.Elton John is still alive, and had lots of creative input, so nothing can be disputed. Elton was a global mega rock-star and genuine musical genius.If Rami Malik can win a best actor Oscar for miming, then Taron Egerton deserves at least the same when considering he actually sang all the songs.This film would also make a great stage play, and will make you dust off your old LP records.

125,maccas-56367,Elton the Musical,8,22 September 2019,"First of all, this is a musical in the truest sense of the word. Don't even begin to compare it to the likes of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". It is more comparable to the likes of ""Mamma Mia"" in style, but with the story centered around Elton's relationship with himself and his inner demons.I loved Taron Egerton in ""Eddie the Eagle"", yet ""Rocketman"" truly allows him to showcase his acting (and vocal) range. It's a seriously impressive performance. I can't wait to see what he does next!This is an energetic film, propelled along with the power of Elton's impressive catalogue of hit songs. I couldn't help but imagine the Broadway version of this. In some ways, it felt like it was solely written for Broadway, though the freedom of filmmaking allowed the fantasy scenes to be fully explored. Things get crazily surreal at times, but it works because it's Elton and it's a musical. If you go into an Elton John biopic thinking it will be ""straight"" in any sense of the word, you're going to quickly have expectations dashed.I'm glad ""Rocketman"" didn't shy away from the mental health issues and addictions of Elton. It makes for a much more authentic character study. The final ""therapy"" scene and ""hug"" left me rather emotional.Was this the best musical I've seen? No. Was it the best biopic? No. But it was enjoyable and makes me want to go crank some Elton John CDs, so I feel it succeeded.",Rocketman
126,MrDHWong,A wild depiction of the rock n' roll lifestyle through the eyes of one of the most iconic musicians of all time,8,29 May 2019,"Rocketman is a biopic about the life of legendary singer-songwriter Elton John. Starring Taron Egerton in the lead role, it is a wild depiction of the rock n' roll lifestyle through the eyes of one of the most iconic musicians of all time.Since he was a shy young boy, Reginald Dwight (Taron Egerton) has had a knack for playing piano by ear and decides to enrol at the Royal Academy of Music, a prestigious musical school that he hopes will nurture his talents. While there, Reginald believes he has what it takes to become a singer-songwriter, adopting the stage name ""Elton John"" and signing an album deal with a major record company. Eventually, Elton John becomes world famous due to his outlandish live performances and catchy songs, making him one of the best selling music artists in history. However, all of this fame and fortune comes at a price, as Elton struggles with drug addiction, depression, the loss of friends, and his own sexuality.With its clever combination of musical numbers and topical subject matter, Rocketman is a must-see for any Elton John fan young and old. Even though the film does glance over a small amount of the musician's struggles at times, the audience is shown just enough to understand the pain he is feeling as he tries to come to terms with it. Taron Egerton gives a fantastic performance as Elton John, practically on the same level as Rami Malek playing Freddie Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". He perfectly captures that signature flamboyance and visceral energy that made Elton so popular in the first place, while also showing his melancholy side when dealing with his problems off-stage. However, unlike ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", this film does not water down the lead subject's rockstar lifestyle as we are shown most of his debaucherous acts of sex and drugs, which gives us a better look into why he was trying to nullify his own personal insecurities in the first place. Even to Elton John novices, this is one biopic worth checking out.I rate it 8/10",Rocketman
127,Alexander_Blanchett,Good musical biopic,8,12 June 2019,"Musician biopics are in at the moment so no surprise there is one of extravagant Elton John. As somebody who once had the pleasure to meet him in person I was especially curious about a look at his often troubled life. I liked that they made a musical version than rather telling the life story. The casting of Taron Egerton was absolutely inspired and totally paid off. He totally pulled the role off and not concentrated on too much interpreting the music icon but rather interpreted his own version of him or rather on the character itself. Also a fantastic singing voice. I loved that all of Elton John's songs actually fitted his life situations perfectly.
Jamie Bell was also good, having some really strong moments. Not the biggest fan of Bryce Dallas Howard, she rather made a cartoonish parody of her role and I found she was rather miscast. John Madden was also rather a stereotype more than a real character. I really liked Gemma Jones though.
The soundtrack was obviously great, the choreography natural and well organized, The costumes are probably a shoe in for an Oscar nomination.",Rocketman
128,TheTruthofItIs,Better titled as Yellow Brick Road,7,23 September 2019,"The title Rocketman doesn't really work for this musical biopic by Dexter Fletcher, a longtime actor trying to direct and with not much success. As others have noted, the production is kind of all over the place, some parts decent other parts forgettable. Many key sequences are put to music which are hit and miss, take Rocketman for instance, you'd think it would have something to do with outer space or its loneliness but they pair it with a hospital scene, ugh. Taron Egerton excels in the role but the supporting cast fades pretty much. The film, with Elton John as one of the EPs, does reveal to us his life of being mostly unloved by parents and those that profess to love him, with Bernie Taupin really being the only one by his side the whole time. One key disappointment was that it gave such short shrift to his first marriage to a woman and whiffed on the associated ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"" hit song. Another disappointment is that it doesn't keep us informed of what year many of the scenes play out. This biopic could've and should've been so much better.",Rocketman

Plus he actually sings all of his songs, unlike Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody. He is more than deserving of an Oscar nomination. I especially enjoyed the focus on Elton himself, as opposed to just his music. You really get a sense of his struggles and difficulties.

132,ronakkotian,A refreshing take on a musical biopic,7,19 July 2021,"The musical biopics I've seen so far follow a traditional way of telling their story so it was refreshing to see one like Rocketman try something different.Rocketman follows Elton John as he looks back on his childhood to his moments of inspiration, success and excess in rehab.One of my biggest complaints with Bohemian Rhapsody is how disingenuous it felt. It took a very safe approach in telling its story without going deep into the characters. I'm happy to say this wasn't the case with Rocketman. The R rating was very suitable and took us into the mind of Elton John and explored dark parts of his life without sugar-coating it. I still wish the film used its R rating to its full potential but regardless of that, I think Dexter Fletcher did a great job depicting the highs and lows of this person. What felt really refreshing was the film's use of musical numbers to convey the thoughts and feelings of Elton John. It was a fantastical approach to tell the story that livened the experience for me. The visuals were striking and the entire film was shot and edited very well.The biggest takeaway was Taron Egerton's performance as Elton John. He genuinely delivered an excellent performance that may be the best of his entire career. He had an infectious presence that I felt all the way through and made me care about him especially during his low points. I loved the costumes he wore during many scenes and it's impressive how he sang all the songs by himself. The supporting cast were also great. Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin, Elton John's long-time friend and writer, was really good. Richard Madden was also great. Stephen Graham and Bryce Dallas Howard delivered strong performances as well.Rocketman is one of the better musical biopics I've seen. It does go through the same stuff we've seen in other related biopics but it's the way Dexter Fletcher approached this story and Taron Egerton's outstanding performance that made Rocketman stand out from the rest.",Rocketman

This film is timed perfectly to coincide with Elton John's 4-year retirement tour.It's important to know that many of the moments of the movie are not in correct chronological order, just in case you thought this was a factual retelling of sorts. Rocketman has been described by many as more of a fantasy than truth, more of a painting than a mirror.

136,davidgee,Elton: the Plain Unvarnished Truth. As if!!,8,7 June 2019,"Hot on the heels of Rami Malek's Oscar-winning turn as Freddie Mercury, we have Taron Egerton going into camp hyperdrive as Elton John in this musical extravaganza charting the rise to superstardom of young Reggie Dwight from Pinner in suburban northwest London. This is not exactly the ""plain unvarnished truth"", since once his career took off Elton didn't really do Plain or Unvarnished.Egerton does a great job capturing Elton's growly vocal style and his weird combination of shyness and monstrous egotism. It's a performance that rivals Michael Douglas's take on Liberace, who is briefly glimpsed on Elton's gran's telly and whom he clearly drew on for inspiration. As in CANDELABRA, the script doesn't hesitate to show the star's battle with homosexuality. Elton has a crush on Bernie Taupin (nicely played by Jamie Bell) who isn't gay but loves Elton and cherishes their Stan-and-Ollie/Eric-and-Ernie partnership. Elton has a stormy relationship with his second manager John Reid (Richard Maddon - fantasy-fulfilling to see him playing gay!). His happy-ever-after with David Furnish comes later than this timeframe.The other movie I was reminded of was MOULIN ROUGE in the way some of the songs are not just performed but acted into scenes that carry the story forward. Bell and Maddon both get to sing.Elton's addictions to booze, drugs and sexual excess (and shopping!) are not skated over, just as they weren't in the Liberace movie. ROCKETMAN is a story with a message about the dangers that fame brings with it. At another level it's simply a great musical biopic.",Rocketman
137,andrewroy-04316,"Rocketman follows the narrative arc we all know, but ineffectively tries to mix musical fantasy with exposition",4,29 September 2019,"Rocketman isn't a bad film, but it doesn't have anything particularly new or creative to say, and its biggest factor in uniqueness is Fletcher's attempt to blend the fantasy of regular musical numbers with the usual musical biopic narrative. Not only does it not fit well, in several cases it actually detracted from the emotional intensity and darkness of the scene. Edgerton is solid in the lead - certainly not the impeccable performance of Phoenix in Walk The Line, but he does a good job on the emotional scenes and his musical performance is decent. It does show flashes of creativity - a couple scene transitions that are really smooth, the cross cutting between the group therapy and scenes of his life, the contrast between his flamboyant Elton personality and shy Reggie personality, etc. The mixing of fantasy and reality is really the fatal flaw of the film, though. I've never been a fan of musicals in general because the musical numbers generally put the plot on pause and don't add much narratively. Here, in addition to that concern, they also contradict the spiral he goes through with addiction. In particular, the scene where he is carried to the hospital and then is lifted up to sing Rocketman was ridiculous and gave a light and uplifting feel to what should've been the most dark and devastating point in the movie. Breaking into a musical number meant for the audience with no separation from the narrative drama also makes the narrative drama all feel less real, which is a significant issue.
It has plenty of the usual biopic flaws too, but they're not as problematic as the fantasy elements. It didn't deal at all with why he struggled with addiction and really hardly showed it at all aside from one or two jarring scenes that are surprising because we haven't seen the extremity of drugs, sex, and other vices. It's extremely predictable, and while it felt like Bohemian Rhapsody in many ways, it was most reminiscent in its one-dimensional supporting characters who had no development and whose ultimate relevance to the main character was obvious from the start (especially the manager who seems like he's his friend and then clearly doesn't care about him, that felt literally identical). His talent and actual music making is taken for granted from the start and we never see him putting in the time that his success required, as biopic frequently ignore. The ending is abrupt as it felt like his character's internal resolution was just beginning, and saying that he's been sober for 28 years in real life highlighted how we really have no idea throughout the movie what his relationship with addiction is and how it changes. The script isn't utterly inept as it was in Bohemian Rhapsody, but in many other ways it feels like a carbon copy, and the one bold choice it made - the fantasy elements - were a complete failure to me.",Rocketman

This film is conceived like a musical based on the songs and the life of Elton John, from the 50s to the early 80s, the selected songs being representative of the manifold events of his life, the ups (his life as an accomplished artist mainly) and the downs (his whole private life according to the movie), since his childhood during which he quickly turns out to be a natural born musician until his first sentimental disappointments and the first cures of detoxification (alcohol, drug, ... and tutti quanti). The movie ends with the punchy « I'm still standing », song written in 1983 after a bad patch and foreshadowing a frantic recovery of his life, the lyrics being written by his friend Bernie Taupin.One of my favorite scenes among many others is the meeting at the Royal Academy of Music, with the third movement of the Sonata Piano No. 11 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played twice. I do not know if it's true but, if so, this child is ingeniously bluffing!The costumes are superb and the actors are fabulous. The realization is ingenious especially with the appropriate and relevant insertion of the songs in the film, like in a musical. As a synthesis: 7/8 of 10.",Rocketman

143,PyroSikTh,Blows Bohemian Rhapsody Out of the Water,8,29 May 2019,"The second Dexter Fletcher-directed biopic about huge British rock stars from the 70s and 80s. Bohemian Rhapsody is an award winning movie plagued by some big problems thanks to backstage drama, but still managed to maintain an interesting and entertaining story of one of the most tragic figures in modern music. Comparisons to that film are going to be hard to avoid, but in short Rocketman is by far the better of the two, and it's unfortunate that it'll likely get overlooked by its predecessor.Rocketman is less a run-of-the-mill biopic, and toes the line very closely to fantastical musical. Now anyone who knows me knows that I hate musicals with a passion. Disney gets a pass because they're animated and the cheesy nature of musicals fit right in with upbeat cartoons, but live-action musicals are just an exercise in cringe for me. Why have these people suddenly burst out into song and dance? Why is the story being told through lyrics and melodies? There's no feelings or emotions there other than happiness so they all come off as one-note and uncomfortable. But Rocketman is different. In Rocketman it works, suiting Elton John's eccentric personality and lifestyle. He dresses up in the craziest costumes, so why not go all the way with the eccentricities?This approach also ties the works of Elton John into the movie. Where Bohemian Rhapsody was as much about the creation of Queen's music as it was about Mercury's lifestyle, in Rocketman the music is what tells the story of Elton John and his lifestyle. His drug-fuelled binges are portrayed with the soulless highs of musical numbers with scene transitions you'd find on Broadway. There's one point in particular that has become one of my favourite scene transitions in cinema. Elton decides to drown himself in his pool at a party. At the bottom he sees his childhood self who starts to sing Rocketman. When people dive in to get him, they hover in the water above like dancers. He's pulled out of the pool, put on a stretcher, and taken to hospital, where's he gets a stomach pump and IV, is stripped of his clothes, and then redressed in a sparkling baseball uniform, doused in make-up, and pushed out onto a stage full of lights and instantly continues the song. It's not quite a one-take scene, but the transition from ambulance to stage is all done in one go without skipping a beat, showing how quickly he was pushed back into touring, and how little his self-destructive behaviour was addressed because of it. In some ways it frustrated me how this serious dramatic moment was glossed over and forgotten about, but that was the point. Elton was left in this state for too long, coasting from one show to the next, country to country, album to album, and he drowned out the days with drugs and alcohol, until he had no idea where he was or what he was doing. And this isn't the only moment seamless scene transitions are used to portray this lapse in memory.I'm not a particularly big fan of Elton John. I'm definitely more interested in him the character than his music, especially when compared to Bohemian Rhapsody and my over-familiarity with some of Queen's biggest hits. So I admit I didn't even know if half the songs were Elton John songs or not (I mean, why wouldn't they be?), but it was great hearing those I was familiar with. Rocketman, Your Song, I'm Still Standing, Saturday Nights Alright, and they were all integrated into the movie fantastically. Furthermore they were all performed by Taron Egerton himself who simultaneously doesn't try too hard to emulate Elton, and yet often sounds just like him. Dude's got a surprisingly killer voice! Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor also show real musical promise as younger versions of Elton as well.And while we're here I want to sing Egerton's praises even more, because goddamn this was the best performance of his life, and I would be disappointed (albeit unsurprised) if he didn't get award nominations at the end of the year. The movie's main focus on Elton's struggle with alcohol and drugs is sold almost purely on Egerton's performance. He manages to bring a humanity to Elton's trademark extravagance and iconic temper, and his emotional breakdowns are so real and relatable. The movie opens with him angrily strutting into rehab and starting his story with pursed lips and a deep resentment boiling under the surface. But it gives way to tears and a look of pure sadness and hopelessness on Egerton's face as he reflects on his loveless childhood, before holding back his vulnerability and bringing the rage back to the surface. In the first 5 minutes of the movie's runtime I was already sold, purely on Egerton's spectacular performance. He shows so much depth and emotional complexity without any signs of struggling whatsoever, and I found it hugely moving and powerful.But that's not to say the rest of the cast lag behind at all. Richard Madden is infuriatingly easy to hate as the manipulative a**hole of John Reid. He slips into that villainous role so easily that it's easy to forget he was ever Robb Stark. Bryce Dallas Howard as Elton's no-nonsense mother was also great in her vapidity and lack of affection for her own son, and her accent was so accurate that I almost didn't recognise it was her at all. Finally, an American who can do a decent British accent! Jamie Bell keeps a cool and calm demeanour throughout as Elton's best friend of fifty years, and co-writer of many of his songs; Bernie. Stephen Graham is great as the eventually won-over Dick James who started Elton on his career trajectory, edging so close to asshole without going all the way and actually being oddly likeable despite his limited screen time.And yet despite all these paragraphs I still haven't managed to talk about what I really want to, and that's how heartbreaking Rocketman's story actually is. This is another way in which it marks its own identity against Bohemian Rhapsody, as it shows Elton's descent into drugs and alcohol brilliantly, and ascribes it to a hopeless and loveless life. He got no love from his father, his mother was distant affectionately, and every love interest he had spurned and betrayed him. He had success, fame, and money, and yet it took decades for him to get what he needed all along; love. By the end of the movie he eventually finds it in the form of self-love, accepting who he is for who he is and not for who those around him want him to be. He gives his childhood self the hug he always needed in one of the film's most heartwarming and powerful moments. The comeback of the film's final moments are more powerful than the admittedly fantastic LiveAid scene because it feels more well-earned. We saw Elton go almost as low as a human can, so to see him stand back up, confront the ghosts of his past, and accept himself felt cathartic and inspirational.If I had a criticism it would be the glossing over his marriage to Renate, something that wasn't particularly well-developed, felt like it came out of nowhere, and was over and forgotten about five minutes later. It felt like a fairly important and crucial part of Elton's story, but like it was only included to tick the box off rather than to actually add anything to movie's story. Personally I thought it could've really added something, and was definitely an aspect I'd have liked to have seen. The only other criticism that springs to mind was the claim of Elton and Bernie not having had an argument in twenty years, which if accurate means either the drama between them in the movie was fabricated, or that it was a liberal use of what an argument is. But that last criticism is super nitpicky, and by no means has any impact on how good or bad the movie was.Rocketman is nothing short of a triumphant success. The writing is really good, effortlessly blending Elton's songs into his life as if they were written specifically for the purpose of the movie. The score and soundtrack become indistinguishable. Egerton's performance was simply spectacular in every way and he is quickly rising up to being one of my favourite actors. The story is heartbreaking and difficult, but important and inspirational all in the same beat. I give Rocketman a really good 8/10. Honestly I want to give it more, and a rewatch would probably earn that, but my personal conflicts with musicals still gets in the way a little bit. But take my word for it, Rocketman is worth every minute and every penny.",Rocketman
144,pilot1009,not a biopic more a montage,8,2 September 2019,"Not what was expecting but a very enjoyable and entertaining film, more a collage or kaleidoscope of E J's life (probably from his perspective) with music as a linkage. So unusual but somehow, for me, it sort of works.",Rocketman
145,dfle3,Daniel Radcliffe and Harry Potter are all growed up and transformed into Elton John. 75%,7,5 July 2019,"This is the truthy story of Elton John (the pop-rock musical phenomenon who composed the song ""Rocket man"", from which this film takes its title), from his time as a young boy who turned out to be a child prodigy on the piano, to the coda where we find out where Elton is at in his life right now. Like a Hollywood (or Bollywood, going on one scene in this film!) musical, the cast often breaks out into song - Elton's, naturally! - with various cast members singing, usually Taron Egerton, playing Elton, as well as other actors sharing the vocal duties with him. Mostly you hear fragments of songs, so be aware that you won't be hearing the original recordings as sung by Elton himself.Often in this film I would be wondering: ""Did that really happen?"". Seeing that Elton and his partner are listed as producers, I would hope that much of the dialogue which made me take notice did, in fact, take place. By ""made me take notice"", I mean comments made to or by Elton, which were especially cutting or what have you. They could be read as being particularly telling or illuminating about the people involved.Often in this film it's quite obvious that what is depicted did not happen, which is why I say that the story has a ""truthy"" quality to it. In fact, there are moments when magic realism is deployed...to good effect, at times. One such time involves Elton's first performance (from memory), in the US. Perhaps at the end of the film, an actual photograph of that performance is shown, which would naturally lead to the magical realism treatment of that moment. On a related matter, I remember years ago seeing a photo of a Buddhist man, I assume, levitating off the ground. The photo would have been presented as actually depicting that. However, many years later (and ago), I saw footage, I believe, of something of that sort. The video gives the lie to the saying ""the camera never lies""! Spookily, having looked up that phrase just now, I see that it is also the title of a song by Elton!Another example of the 'truthy' element to this film...I'd wonder if Elton really did write a song at a certain point in time. Then I'd hear a song which I KNEW was definitely not of that era! Sticklers for accuracy, you have been warned! It's magic realism, people!There is one scene where Elton is kissed by an African American music artist, before Elton had begun his solo career. I wondered if that really happened. Was it true, or truthy? Since I've been aware that Elton mostly composed the music to his songs (and not the lyrics), I also wondered if he really did write the lyrics to ""Your song"", which the film gives the impression that he did. Even though that song isn't a favourite of mine, I must say that it evoked the most powerful emotional response in me of any scene in this film. Not affecting me quite so much, but I did note a moment in Elton's final therapy session, where he is asked a question which he has often asked himself. That was also moving, but I can't say that it made a lot of sense to me in the context of this film, as I didn't get the sense that this was a relationship in which it was germane to express that sentiment. Perhaps that sense could have been better expressed in the film? Maybe. In fact, there's one scene where Elton comments about how he feels about himself. Again, the film didn't show to me that Elton was feeling that way.In any case, one of the themes of this film is how we perceive ourselves and what we imagine that people expect of us. Elton's private life, as shown in the film, could be viewed as a performance piece of what Elton imagined what was expected of him, as far as relationships and his persona went.Told in broad-brush strokes and seemingly covering every dot point of Elton's life (not that I'd know), it did occur to me at the time, or after seeing the film, that I wished that we got to know Elton better, as the film often functions as a snapshot of his life. For instance:* What happened to Elton's piano studies at the Royal Academy of Music?* Who were his early childhood friends?* What was his first relationship? If that was shown in the film, why not delve deeper into it?* The film seems to imply that Elton made an immediate musical impact. I don't think that he did. I would have liked to have seen some scenes concerning this.* Elton's relationship and marriage to a woman is briefly covered. The scene dealing with their married life was quite telling. Was it like that from day one, though?* Elton mentions how promiscuous he was during one therapy session. There's nothing in the film to back that up.* Elton's last marriage appears to be off limits, apart from some (literal) snapshots of his partner). It seems that Elton is being very protective of his privacy here...but maybe also throughout the film?I suppose that my major criticism of this film is that what Elton says, for example, isn't clearly seen in the film, as is the case for his feelings for his manager. It therefore surprises to hear him say that.Miscellaneous:* Elton accounted for 5% of all records sales at one point, it's stated.* I think that the real Elton gives one of the all-time great rock vocal performances in ""Saturday night's all right"". Wouldn't trade him for Plant or Mercury et. al!* Sometimes Egerton reminds me of Elton (as opposed to Radcliffe!).* The trailer for this film seems to have a scene that I didn't see in the film, where a receptionist, I think, says to Reginald: ""That's my grandad's name!"".",Rocketman
146,sweidman-28016,A Musical Fantasy,8,6 June 2019,"Rocketman Review:Rocketman is a musical fantasy about the fantastical human story of Elton John's breakthrough years. We've seen many music biopics over the years. They're basically all the same and follow the same format. But not Rocketman. This film was much more than a biopic. It was a real life fantasy. I'm so glad this wasn't another Bohemian Rhapsody where it was the typical setup and very predictable. I will admit the film does have some hints of that throughout but there's not much you can do about it. What Rocketman does is tells a story, but how Elton John envisions it in a musical format. I thought that was creative and we haven't seen anything like that. The story was just done very well. Lee Hall has been nominated by the Academy before for Billy Elliot, a film also about the arts that was later turned into a musical. I think this is a very good screenplay and potentially Oscar worthy for its creativity. Speaking of Oscar worthy, Taron Egerton. I knew he could act and was a decent singer, but wow. This was an amazing performance. If Rami Malek can win the Oscar for Best Actor Egerton better be nominated at least. The Academy tends to forget films that are released earlier in the year so I'm hoping this film created an impact for at least the Acting category (also same with Lupita in Us). He's such a great actor and singer but what I really like is that he wasn't trying to copy Elton John. He made him his own version with his own styles and I thought that was good of him. I'm tired of portrayals and actors trying too hard to be exactly the same so we have to compare them. Yes, I did (and many other people) compared him to Elton John but it was given that this was his own style of him. The other surprise standout for me was Bryce Dallas Howard as Sheila, his mother. Every scene she was in I just really enjoyed. This is my favorite role of hers since The Help. I don't think many people are recognizing this but I think she was amazing too. I thought everybody was pretty good in this. I know this was his first film but Matthew Illesley who played young Elton just kind of annoyed me. That was the only actor I just didn't really like, though he had a touching scene towards the end which I liked. It's sad to see some of the stuff that happens in this because that's how Elton felt/feels. That scene I was just talking about brought some tears to my eyes honestly. I'm sure everybody will know it. The musical scenes in the film were wonderful. I loved the choreography but most of all the imagery. There was lots of fantastical imagery that I think helped the scenes with the fantasy feel to it. The Rocketman scene was most notably the best with imagery. The score was pretty good with tunes of Elton John's songs, especially Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Overall I think this is a unique film that's better than most musical bio pics. With only few flaws like some longer, slow scenes, one annoying actor, and similar style to other bio pics, I think this is a good movie. Go see Rocketman if you're a fan of his music, musicals, and want to see something unique.My Grade: A-",Rocketman
147,bbewnylorac,Great depiction of an amazing life,8,2 June 2019,"I had reservations about this film - Elton John himself and his husband David Furnish are producers, so I wondered, would it gloss over the tough and less savoury bits? I guess I don't know enough about the real story to say, but it did come across as a genuine and heartfelt yarn. And it's also an amazingly entertaining film - an element that too many biopics forget about. The director, Dexter Fletcher, and the writers take a risk in staging many musical and fantasy scenes, but in the end, they are very effective in telling the story in perhaps a more interesting way than a more conventional, linear film. Taron Egerton is fantastic as Elton. Chiefly, he has the energy and the vulnerability to portray the roller coaster of emotions Elton goes through, while he convincingly pulls off the showman element.
Although Elton is a superlative soul singer, which would be almost impossible to emulate. One of the cores of the film, to me, is the 'love story' of Elton's friendship with lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) who is frankly the most stable, rational, constant presence in Elton's life. It's kind of lovely. The second element that stunned me was Elton's abusive parents, Sheila and Stanley. The characters, played with devastating iciness by the under-rated Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh, manage to damage, but not stop, their talented son's rise to fame through their lack of love and the mum Sheila's assertion, when she learns Elton is gay, that he'll probably never be loved by anyone. Her reaction to Elton's struggles with drugs is to ask that he pay her to move far away, so she doesn't have to cope with the terrible newspaper headlines. His Dad, meanwhile, starts a new family and heaps love and affection on his young sons, while not showing any signs he wants Elton in his life. They are two devastating portrayals, and the real life pair are no longer alive to defend themselves. But if true, it makes Elton's success even more well deserved and hard earned.",Rocketman
148,ethanbresnett,An honest and open look at Elton's breakthrough years,8,5 April 2020,"I have very mixed feelings about this film. I should perhaps preface my following views on the film by saying I'm not a huge fan on Elton John's music. I'm familiar with some of his biggest hits and enjoy them, but beyond that I've not much interest or knowledge of his records. I do think that having a bit more of an interest in him as a person and his music would heighten the enjoyment of Rocketman, but even without that it is still a film worth watching, telling a very human story at its core.Considering that he was playing such an icon (and one who is still alive) all eyes were on Taron and his performance, which was undeniably great. He captured so many emotions in his performance, playing the tortured side of Elton incredibly well, and also demonstrating his eccentric and extroverted side remarkably. You really got the sense that no matter what was going on superficially, there was always something insidious under the façade and Taron did a fantastic job in demonstrating this complexity and tragedy of John's breakout years.As mentioned before I really had very little idea of the life of Elton John, so the rawness and honesty of this film really struck me. This film puts all of Elton's tragedy and flaws front and centre, confronting the destructive side of fame and not shying away from anything.In a reflection of his life, his performances and his character, the film adopts a slightly psychedelic approach to some of its story telling, which I think blended really well the characters and tone.This film is definitely one to watch, but was perhaps more tragic than I was expecting. Ultimately it ends positively and there are bountiful moments of levity throughout, but what struck me most about Rocketman was the way it confronted the pitfalls of fame and the demons of addiction. A good film, but the level of enjoyment may hinge slightly on whether you are an Elton fan or not!",Rocketman
149,CineMuseFilms,a swirling kaleidoscope of emotion and music,9,11 June 2019,"The traditional musical is the oldest film genre and it still relies on magical fantasy for suspending audience disbelief. This allows characters to spontaneously break into song or dance, unlike musical bio-pics such as Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) that realistically integrate the music into their narrative flow. The epic-scaled Rocketman (2019) is a nostalgic reversion to the traditional musical form; knowing this beforehand helps to make sense of what is a swirling kaleidoscope of emotion and music.Where bio-pics tend to look at a life story, the musical Rocketman is a selective biography that traces a musical icon's ascent to the starry heavens during the 70s. The opening minutes are bold, brash, and fantastical: Elton John (Taron Egerton) is resplendent in high-arch feathered sequins, storming toward camera after bailing out of a packed concert hall. He walks across a city and straight into an alcoholic rehab group, plonks into a chair and, staring through trademark crazy glasses, proceeds to unravel his journey as a lonely youth prodigy who became a substance abusing mega-star.What follows is a series of loosely connected vignettes that use musical lyrics as narrative entry-points to explain his complex vulnerabilities. The young Reginald Dwight was raised by emotionally abusive parents who were incapable of loving him, a burden that intensified his desire to be whatever it took to please others. Encouraged by his grandmother, his musical talent grew as a self-defensive response to what he experienced as an uncaring world. The mature Elton John progressed to singing odes of pain, awe, and confused sexual identity, mostly delivered with flamboyance and electric energy. Much of it comes from an unhappy place and this makes the film more revelationery than celebratory.Taron Egerton channels the icon with mesmerising brilliance; it is a performance made more astonishing by singing with astonishing authenticity a dozen songs from Elton John's enormous repertoire. The cinematography is as exuberant as the performances; many scenes verge on musical artworks as the human dynamo appears disconnected from the earth's gravity. The sets and costumes are fabulous, and the pace of the story is captivating.What you take away from Rocketman depends on what you bring in terms of fan status and personal interest. Some will see it as a story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll; others a musical hero's journey to mega-celebrity. Others may reflect on why there are so many music-inspired films in current cinema. The rise of anti-progressive forces in today's frenetic and fractured world means new generations lack heroes; the revival of heroic musicians might go some way to filling this gap.",Rocketman
150,akcenat,A musical fantasia about Elton John's life that overdoses on drugs and sex.,7,19 August 2019,"Dexter Fletcher, director of the ""Rocketman"" is also responsible for rescuing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" when its original director (Bryan Singer) was fired. It might be unfair to compare these two movies because they are the stories of two distinct artists. But, each film tells stories about a British gay rock 'n roll superstar during roughly the same period, each film uses an artist's hit song as the title, each film displays the artist's flamboyant on-stage and off-stage personas and each film has plenty of hit songs. Despite the high energy and exorbitant costumes and eye-wears, the Elton John character in this film lacks the exhilarating visual appearance compared to Freddie Mercury. Even though Taron Egerton (Kingman and Eddie the Eagle) is good at playing Elton John, he doesn't reach to the same intensity as Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury. Although this film doesn't whitewash Elton John's homosexuality, it doesn't really explore the theme any deeper than Freddie's either.The enduring warm relationship with Bernie Taupin, his longtime lyricist, and the reliable and likable Jamie Bell is the solidest & warmest presence in the film. Ultimately, ""Rocketman"" is not so much a biopic as vibrant, full-fledged phantasmagoria of a movie musical. Also, with a piano man as world-renowned as Elton John, the songs should really speak for themselves in a biopic about his life but mostly they don't. The tunes sometimes take center stage, although the musical arrangements have been changed ... for the worse. Perhaps this is a sin to say, but ""Rocketman"" is one film soundtrack I never care to hear again.The fact that Elton John is one of the executive producers and his husband David Furnish is one of the producers makes us wonder whether the film can be reasonably objective about which stories should be told in the film about Elton John.Rating: For fans 8+, for us others 6+/7- and please lower your expectations.",Rocketman

BR was about Freddie and how he messed up his life half way through the film when he turned his back on his wife and his band and started stalking boys in truck stops and doing drugs with groupies. Rocketman is a similar story but with music that isn't as good. Elton was also married and happy until he decided he wasn't and went another direction. It hasn't killed him yet like it did Freddie and George Michael but he's only in his 60s. Elton had some solid hits with Honkey Cat, Daniel and others.

153,gsygsy,Not bad,6,22 May 2019,"A work of efficient legacy image-management by Sir Elton and his team. It's quite funny in places, visually impressive in others (the costumes are a real treat), harmlessly enjoyable on the whole. It's like watching an unusually raunchy school pageant, basically innocent but with a lot of knowing references to that naughty world of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll beyond -- or maybe on -- the sports fields.Taron Egerton is a good, perhaps very good, character actor in the making. He has a certain hidden quality that makes him intriguing. He doesn't have the charisma of a Brad Pitt or a Leonardo de Caprio, or the young Johhny Depp. Using his acting chops, he successfully recreates Elton the performer. He doesn't communicate the depths of despair that we're shown the great man going through, though. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the problem is the glib psychobabble of these scenes that are the weak points of Lee Hall's otherwise nicely-wrought script. Acting support varies from the excellent (Jamie Bell, Gemma Jones) to the inexplicable (Bryce Dallas Howard).The film is a juke-box musical, drawing on Sir Elton's extensive back catalogue to slot in to appropriate on-screen situations. Mostly these are easy fits (Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, for example), some more oblique. The most successful is the title number, which is realised in an entirely unexpected, totally effective way. Kudos to all concerned.I have no doubt this movie, like Bohemian Rhapsody before it, will make a several mountains of money. It's not a bad film. On the whole it's an entertaining film. Credit to director Dexter Fletcher and his team for that. For me, this attempt to be mega-popular is always going to mean punches are pulled, that the unhappiness is never going to be particularly intense, while the highs are only tolerably high. On the other hand, the movie embraces Elton's gayness, working it through from a secret to a point of pride. That's excellent.",Rocketman
154,david-meldrum,Works On Every Level - Despite My Lack Of Love For Elton's Music,8,24 September 2019,"I really don't know how to quantify this; I have no great love for Elton John's music (though I do gladly acknowledge that Your Song is one of the most romantic songs ever written); I really don't like Taron Egerton's blank canvass acting. But this film still creeps in and worms into my emotions. It's a brave decision to play this film as a full-blown musical, complete with Elton John's back catalogue recast as a set of show tunes with accompanying choreography. There are some brilliant moments - the decision to tell the story in retrospect through an AA meeting (this film is very good on addiction, and it's refreshing to see a portrayal of a man with an eating disorder); there's a stunning sequence during the first American gig which perfectly captures that special moment of connection between performer and audience where a gig transcends to something truly elevating; there's a great supporting performance from Richard Madden; and for all my cynicism, Taron Egerton really can sing. For most of the film, I suspected emotional involvement was directly proportional to the viewer's love for Elton John's music, hence my sense of being impressed but unmoved most of the time. But towards the end come two striking emotionally cathartic moments; a moment of reconciliation between Elton's adult and childhood selves, and a wise decision to close with I'm Still Standing, a song. If the test of a musical biopic is to draw in and move those who don't love the music of the central character, this film works on every level; even if I retain a far greater affection for the dame director's earlier musical, Sunshine On Leith.",Rocketman

The other major mistake of this movie was having Taron Egerton sing the Elton John songs, rather than Elton himself. Why?The proof is in the pudding...Bohemian Rhapsody did far better than Rocketman at the worldwide box office, despite better critical reviews of Rocketman and arguably, Elton John was a much bigger act than Queen worldwide.

This film is so beautifully made that you can't take your eyes off the screen. Taron Egerton (""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") is beyond incredible; he doesn't simply portray Elton John, he is him.

161,shanayneigh,A school play hiding behind good music,3,22 November 2019,"To call the characters two dimensional would be giving the writer and director too much credit. Every single character is one note. The brusque cigar chomping producer. The other devilish producer. The aloof parents. Poor Elton seems to have been completely surrounded by total a-holes his whole life. The only character and his relationship to Elton that is a bit more fleshed out is Bernie Taupin. Probably because he's still friends with Elton. Maybe this is what happens when someone (and their significant other) produce their own biopic.The only thing worse than the characters is the storytelling, which is about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the balls. It reeks of amateur hour. Everything is wildly predictable. I watched this movie with a group of friends, and we laughed throughout the whole movie at its inept storytelling.Some examples:When Elton is auditioning for music school and forgot to bring his sheet music I said: ""I bet he's going to play what the teacher just played, and do so perfectly.""When he stopped playing and she asked why I said: ""He's going to tell the teacher 'Because that's where you stopped'.""When Elton gets out of rehab I said: ""I bet they're going to play 'I'm still standing'.""The examples go on and on and on. And this is not because me and my friends are psychic or geniuses, it's just one hell of a poorly written movie.When Elton and Bernie move into an apartment they meet their female landlord sitting on the stoop. If I remember correctly they only say hello, and she's given about 15 seconds of screen time. The next scene Elton is racked with anxiety and feeling of guilt about being gay, and how he's going to tell his girlfriend. The one we have seen for roughly 15 seconds. Here's a friendly tip to the writer of this movie: If you want your audience to sympathize with, or even feel something for, the characters you write, how about we get to know them a little bit?But if you think they only do this once in this movie, you would be mistaken. Later on Elton meets a woman when he makes another album. I think they only meet in one scene (maybe two), and then they get happily married. Smash cut to them coming out from separate bedrooms, having their breakfast together in silence, clearly unhappy with the whole situation. Again, as a viewer I feel absolutely nothing, since I have only met this character for a few minutes in only a handful of scenes, yet this is supposed to be a big moment in Elton's life.The music is great, of course. But if you think you're going to learn anything about how that music was created, you'd be wrong. Everything comes to Elton as instant inspiration apparently. Nothing is tried out or experimented on, everything is just perfect from the start.This was not one for the history books.",Rocketman

167,movieman6-413-929510,Biographical musical about music legend Elton John.,7,30 May 2019,"Rocketman is a new film adaptation of a biography. The film is directed by Dexter Fletcher, the director of Eddie the Eagle.The film is about the biography of Reginald Kenneth Dwight, who is more known by his stage name: Elton John. Elton John is played in the film by Taron Egerton. The film is further produced by Elton John. The film focuses on the ups and downs in Elton John's life. How in his childhood he always had the feeling that he did not get enough love from his parents and then little from his father.When he shows that he has a musical talent, he is sent by his parents to a special school for music. At this school he meets Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), who is good at thinking up and writing lyrics. In this way the two become friends and know how to break through in the music world. Elton John quickly touches many people with his unique music style and lyrics. In this way he comes into contact with the positive sides of the music world such as money and fans, but also with the negative sides such as too much alcohol and other drug use. He did these wrong things to try to escape his inner loneliness. Elton must try to overcome the negative sides in order to find his own happiness for himself and his fans.Dexter Fletcher has turned this biography into a musical, because in the middle of the scenes they often suddenly switch to a song. This film is a bit different, for example, last year's Bohemian Rhapsody musical biography. Dexter Fletcher has also taken over the directing work of this film, after director Bryan Singer went the wrong way and was fired by the studio work. Dexter has corrected his mistakes and finished that film.
With Rocketman, he was given the opportunity to make a musical biography himself. By turning this biography into a musical rather than a biography, he has taken the opportunity to portray both similar films in a different way. With Bohemian Rhapsody, they also played it safely and did not delve too deeply into the negative aspects of Freddie Mercury's life. With Rocketman they have dared to take this step more and show some dark times from Elton John's career, but as a viewer you also get the necessary explanation to understand why these things happened in his life.
In many biography films about well-known music artists, the artist who is making the biography is often deceased, but Elton John is still alive. The film ends sometime around 1990 and so misses some happy moments of Elton's daily life these days. If they had spent a little less time on all dark sides in the script, there would have been enough time left over for example to meet his partner, how he starts his own family or how he supports charity actions.By playing this biography as a musical, as a viewer you actually get the chance to sing the songs or to tap the beat with your hands or feet. In Bohemian Rhapsody they used Freddie Mercury's audio clips on which Rami Malek who played the role of Freddie Mercury only had to play on. Taron Egerton and the rest of the cast really sing the songs of this film themselves. The songs may sound a little different than you know them. This has given the cast the chance to put the songs in their own way.
Taron Egerton and Elton John have already collaborated on this movie in the movie Kingsman: The Golden Circle. Elton John also advised Taron Egerton not to copy his personality completely, but to make it his own version. This way Taron Egerton knows how to portray the role in a good and personal way.",Rocketman
168,ritera1,Competent filmmaking. Nothing new.,7,29 November 2019,"It filled a market after Bohemian Rhapsody. Essentially was a showcase for the music mixed in with some elements of his story LOOSELY interpreted. But that's the nature of these ""Based on a True Story"" things. Sure, the changes serve the story in a demanding medium, but they are still false stories.Egerton was energetic and enthusiastic but was not really given much to work with. The rest of the cast were likely very good actors but were not able to fire up the screen. Madden was effective as the bad guy, though. And Bryce Dallas Howard is a good lookin' woman even when they put some pounds on her.The direction was by-the-numbers with the big venues falling flat from unimpressive CG. It seem to take a lighthearted tone, although lighthearted is not what you'd call substance abuse. Apparently Elton John didn't want it to be PG-13, but I felt like it was in that ballpark.The father elements were very ham-fisted and kind of melodramatic.If you miss it, you're not missing much.",Rocketman
169,themadmovieman,A dizzyingly entertaining music spectacle that celebrates its subject in style,8,22 May 2019,"With vibrant, passionate and dazzling energy from beginning to end, Rocketman sets a new gold standard for the music biopic, brilliantly blending a riveting true story with inventive and dizzyingly entertaining musical shenanigans throughout, not to mention a fantastic lead performance from Taron Egerton, and stunning directing from Dexter Fletcher that brings it all together into one delightful and endlessly enthralling whirlwind.It's really quite impressive how this film takes on the premise of a music biopic, because one of the genre's innate issues is that, while the personal stories of each individual musician through history are of course different in their own ways, the general arc of the rise of a superstar and the troubles that come with it are very similar in a majority of films.Now, narrative-wise, that's the case with Rocketman, with Elton John rising from humble beginnings to become an immense celebrity, all the while struggling with a number of inner demons, worsened by the world of excess that he's thrown into. Of course, it's an engaging true story, but it will ring bells of a number of other music biopics, above all Bohemian Rhapsody.However, the narrative arc is thankfully where the similarities between Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody end. Where Bohemian Rhapsody takes a dull, very literal approach to telling a music biopic, Rocketman recognises that there is more to show than just the chronology of a musician's life, and that's where the music itself comes in.You can never really count music biopics as proper movie musicals, because while they always feature the artist's songs, they rarely burst into life like a classic movie musical. The case is very different with Rocketman, which ingeniously uses the songs of Elton John to not only tell the story of his life, but bring a powerful, vibrant and endlessly delightful musical energy to the film as a whole.If you don't like Elton John's music, then I'll warn you, because there is a hell of a lot of music in this film, starting right from its bold opening sequence, forming the core of the film's energy, and often even taking centre stage from the narrative itself. Perhaps if you just want to learn about the life of Elton John, then this approach won't be ideal, but as far as making a cinematic and immensely entertaining movie goes, Rocketman hits the nail right on the head with this.Blending fantasy with reality, non-diegetic music with diegetic music, and everything in between, the way that this film uses the songs is like very few others. The musical breaks are never jarring interruptions in the narrative flow, and fundamentally help to develop and advance the story while they're happening too. Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman isn't interested in hamfistedly forcing in a hit or two when the chronology warrants it, but it instead celebrates the brilliant music and energy of its subject, with passion that dances off the screen and wraps you up into an exhilarating whirlwind.Taron Egerton too, mirrors the film's brilliant energy and passion, portraying Elton John not only in a convincing and likable manner, but fantastically blending the singer's lively stage persona and real-world troubles into one, something that's so hard to do in such sleek and engrossing fashion. And of course, Egerton is doing the singing himself here. It's not dubbing, he emulates John's voice and sings the songs himself, an incredible achievement that makes his performance all the more exhilarating and impressive to watch.And finally, a word on director Dexter Fletcher, who somehow manages to bring everything in this fantastic whirlwind of a musical biopic under one roof. Blending the music together with orthodox drama in incredibly slick fashion, the film runs at an electrifying pace throughout, running to the beat of its fantastic soundtrack, all the while engrossing you all the more in the story at hand.Fletcher starts the film off with exhilarating energy, but even when things do take a darker turn in the story, he somehow manages to keep that delightful, vibrant fun factor at play, with the atmosphere bouncing wildly between darker personal drama and euphoric musical energy. And yet, that total inconsistency and almost insane range of atmopshere only adds to the immense passion and energy of the film as a whole, keeping its feverishly entertaining vibes at top pitch all the way to the finish.Overall, I absolutely adored Rocketman. Not just your average music biopic, it tells a riveting story that's accentuated by dizzyingly entertaining musical energy, vibrant visuals, electrifying pacing, and a truly brilliant lead performance, all somehow brought together by director Dexter Fletcher.",Rocketman
170,WalkdenEntertainment,"You Know The Song, Now Know About The Legend!",8,6 March 2020,"Rocketman is the story of the famous singer and performer ""Elton John"". To my surprise this film is best classed as a musical.The film begins with Elton John as a young boy discovering love for playing the piano and us witnessing his distant relationship with both of his parents. Naturally the film also focuses on Elton John as an adult along with re-living many classic hits with dance sequences for fans to enjoy too.When I first heard online that actor Taron Ederton (best known for his role in Kingsman) would be playing Elton John, I was rather curious because Elton John is such a unique person. After watching the film I personally found his performance breath taking and extremely surprising. Taron Ederton is incredibly convincing as Elton John, singing and dealing with the multiple dark challenges the singer faced in real life.Watching this film on 4K Bluray, I was also impressed by the audio track which is easily the biggest strength of the film. Re-living the classic musical hits with impressive dance sequences, I found it impossible not to either sing along or tap my feet. Each song also gave an insight, sometimes in the form of a fantasy, into the mind of Elton John. Some of these fantasies may seem a little much or seem vague as to what it all actually represents. This brings me to the next point...One my issues with Rocketman is many stories which I was personally keen to know more about are skip over or ignored. Same could be said about moral messages the film tries to introduce but are never concluded. The film's primary focus is to share the music and reveal Elton John's dark past in many areas which includes his love life, drugs, his parents and the list goes on.Overall, Rocketman is an entertaining film and I was surprised to find the film was actually a musical which I wasn't expecting. Actor Taron Egerton also brings an outstanding performance and has simply left me speechless upon witnessing the end results. Needless to say this is one for Elton John fans who will enjoy some classic hits on the big screen and for those who wish to know about Elton's dark past and challenges. 8.4/10 - Walkden Entertainment",Rocketman

It all went south when Freddie left his wife and started on a path of death and destruction. ROCKETMAN is a film where Elton John plays the victim of his own insanity. A musical (that wasn't in the previews) about his addictions to sex, drugs, alcohol and food. He blames his parents and the government and bad relationships and .... but the music is the magic. He explains he is a bit of a autistic savant, able to sit down at the piano with lyrics from his writing partner and bang out a tune in under an hour. HIs music is where this movie shines.

It shows someone who was constantly brilliant but constantly unloved, lonely and sad throughout his whole early life. There are no happy times at all despite his great success, and we are reminded of both the sadness and success over and over again.It is also sad that, despite a great vocal performance by Taron Egerton, there are no versions of these brilliant songs that I think people will want to hear again from the soundtrack, just because of the way they are used.What saves the film, apart from the reminder of the phenomenal back catalogue Elton John has, is the acting performance of Egerton, Jamie Bell and The more minor role of Stephen Graham.

175,patriciogl10,Solid and fresh.,8,7 November 2019,"So many biopics that follow the same formulaic way of telling an artist's life story end up leaving a sense of grotesque coarseness after watching them. It's high time a biopic production took some risks in order to tell a story in a more creative fashion. Essentially, Rocketman, deals with the beginnings of Elton John's career, browsing through the most well-known songs of his catalogue in musical form. Not only do the songs play in the background as part of the soundtrack but are also performed in the narrative context by most of the cast and extras. So, most of the songs are in fact musical numbers with a touch of fantasy as it comes from Elton John's flamboyant way of processing everything around him.Taron Egerton brilliantly shines in his grandiose performance; not only taking center stage but also sharing the spotlight with the rest of the cast, complementing each other fantastically. Vocally, he was impressive in his delivery; not mimicking Elton but imposing his own style without altering what essentially makes Elton John sound like Elton John; Egerton's approach proved to be very fruitful, enhancing not only his overall performance but also the quality of the musical renditions and the film itself.Special mentions to Bryce Dallas Howard and Jamie Bell's portrayals, which are quite levelled up to Egerton's although in a smaller proportion.
An authentic portrait of an extravagant individual and his striking lifestyle, also his lucid relationship with his songwriting partner, which takes up a great part of the film's content. This is a great biopic, I urge you to watch it.",Rocketman

The loud and kaleidoscopic view of the film perfectly presents Elton John in all his extravagant and glorious glory. The movie chronicles the star's troubled beginnings as Reginald Dwight to his transformation to superstardom. The fame, drugs, homosexuality, personal relationships and of course, the music, those tunes that graced speakers and gave life an uplifting paradisial lilt whenever it played are all here. Taron Egerton portrays the man with an amiable and ebullient charm that's quite endearing and he glides through this party with natural ease. His depiction may lack the real Elton John's meanness and nastiness (where are those legendary tantrums?) but his verve and enthusiasm pull this through.

However, in comparison to an older musical biopic like Walk the line about Johnny Cash's life it certain adds flare but loses narrative. Bohemian Rhapsody was drawn out and poorly structured, in this case Rocketman was messy and jumbled, jumping from scene to scene.Ofcourse, ignoring the lack of narrative structure, the individual set pieces and scenes were wonderfully done, and the performance by Taron Edgerton was great. Stringed together is a montage of really great and over the top music videos but barely justified as a complete piece of cinema, narrative and all.",Rocketman
181,asifahsankhan,"In an exceptionally demanding role with sky-high expectations, Egerton was spectacular.",8,16 July 2019,"To be upfront, I am notedly critical of the biopic genre, particularly those that center around musicians and performers, primarily because a life's story does not provide a narrative structure with an actual plot. When the totality of a career is the crowning achievement of a life that is being depicted, the guidelines are often too vague to create an actual cohesive tale about said life. Biopics are the film counterparts to nonfiction biographies you can find at your local publicly funded library, and if you have not read one of those since doing a book report in Elementary School, you can be forgiven. While the material could be fascinating, the medium consists of a recitation of facts and events, as opposed to an actual story. In my opinion, biographies translate better into a documentary-style film, rather than a forced narrative out of a compilation of factually embellished, loosely connected significant moments.Having said that, it is to a film's credit when it tries to be creative with the material it is given, even as it is simultaneously handicapped by its ill-defined goals. ""Rocketman"" attempts to remedy this obstacle by using Elton's group therapy in rehab as a framing device, where he recounts his life up until that point. It is not the most original technique ever utilized, but it does signify an effort to create an organized story. But ultimately, people do not go to see films like ""Rocketman"" to identify if there is a narrative structure or not. Chances are that I am amongst the few who suck the fun out of an experience by demanding certain checkmarks that are irrelevant to most. The masses flock to the theaters to see Elton perform his many hit songs and possibly learn a little something along the way, and by that measure, ""Rocketman"" succeeds beyond a shadow of a doubt. This is a film with exceptional performances and musical displays.If you are a fan of Elton John, and I believe that is a safe assumption if you are a viewer of the film, you shan't be disappointed with the renditions of most of his greatest hits in the film. The cast is brilliant with their singing, treating the songs like the true art they are, often incorporating elements of fantasy into the choreography that accompanies the lyrics. And to the film's merit, the songs are actively used as plot devices to facilitate character development, a technique that can often be difficult to effectively execute. The entirety of the productions of ""Saturday Night's Alright (for Fighting)"", ""Your Song"", and ""Yellow Brick Road"" are personal favorites of mine, as they display the heights of heart and passion within Elton.Lead actor Taron Egerton deserves an immense amount of praise for his performance in this role. He fully encapsulates every aspect of Elton, including his display of exceptional vocal talents and energetic, rhythmic dance moves. On the more personal angles of Elton's life, Egerton totally espouses the pain and rage of the loneliness he endured, whether it be due to him coming to grips with his sexuality or the void left by the cold-heartedness of his mother and abandonment by his father, as well as the hedonistic lifestyle Elton embraced as a coping mechanism throughout much of his life.

Definitely check this one out, especially if you're an Elton John fan!",Rocketman
185,harrylosborne,Aaron Egerton doing his best to drag Rocketman out from mediocrity,5,11 June 2019,"It's a shame that Bohemian Rhapsody came out only a year ago - a highly-acclaimed biopic of an openly gay music icon struggling against personal demons and the people around himself. Rocketman's story is a carbon copy, carving out the same niche that Rami Malek had already filled, to the detriment of this production. Bad luck is not the only culprit for this movie falling flat, however: a lack of cohesion really damages the flow of the film, and musical numbers aren't enough to bring it back from the edge of averageness.Rocket man can't seem to quite decide whether it is a biopic of one man's life, or is truly a ""musical"" in the true sense of the word. Launching into song doesn't quite work in this format, as it tries to maintain historical accuracy whilst conversely using songs that didn't exist during the time period of a particular scene. Another issue arises with the diluting of the quality of some songs: for example, the titular musical number (and arguably the most well-known song featured) is, in part, sung by both a child and in an A cappella style. Some may find this endearing and more emotive, but I feel these genres of films should try to stick closely to the originals to enhance the nostalgia the target audience will feel.Credit where credit's due, Taron Egerton (Elton John) does a quality job delivering his role's highs and lows, always walking the line of sanity; Richard Madden (John Reid) is also strong as Elton's suave future manager. The rest of the cast are unfortunately stuck with misguided scriptwriting, making any other performances far more difficult. The one that I found most irksome was the dynamic between Elton and his family - Rocketman couldn't seem to decide how to portray his relationship with his mother (Dallas Bryce Howard), as their feelings seemed to swing from mutual resentment to being one another's only comforts. By the end of the film, nothing is really worth remembering but Egerton's performance and Elton's songs.",Rocketman
186,MrPupkin,A bright and colorful telling of a rock icon's life that shows off the ups and downs in splendorific fashion.,8,10 July 2020,"The movie is just amazing, with Elton's music weaving his story. Taron killed it as Elton John, not by just acting as Elton but singing his songs in his own voice. Many people says that the movie is inaccurate with releases of songs, but they don't understand that the movie is not a biopic and is a musical so the music and songs have to drive the story. Must watch for every Elton John's fan or even those who aren't, because you are going to be after watching the movie.",Rocketman

It came across as unrealistic and greatly lacked depth . it simply stays on the surface...There was Nothing about this character that caught my interest , it was a shallow study of a man who felt unloved, who lashed out at others who tried to help him and basically came across as a narcissistic and pompous ass..
What did I like? well the actor did a good job with the songs and what he had to work with, but really, it was more the writers and the director who blew it here...I Do like alot of eltons songs and the lead sang them quite well But there is simply NO comparison between this fiasco and Bohemian Rhapsody...one is c grade and the other Oscar caliber acting, cinematography and directing...I cant recommend this one unless you want to see a self centered ,coked up alcoholic parading around the screen for 2 hrs carrying on in the shallowest of ways....Not even remotely oscar worthy",Rocketman
188,CabbageCustard,Enjoyable biopic of Sir Elton John,7,4 September 2019,"This is an credible though not perfect biopic of Sir Elton John. Understandably, it doesn't cover his whole life. It ends before it even touches on his more recent career achievements, such as writing the music for the Lion King movie or Billy Elliot stage show. Even his long term relationship and marriage with David Furnish is only mentioned as part of the end credits. No, this movie focuses mainly on earlier days of the star's career, the struggles he had to overcome his demons and the influences that brought them into his life in the first place - starting from a young age. As you would imagine, there is a lot of Sir Elton's music included and if you're not a fan of that then this movie is probably not for you. There are a number of highly stylized scenes too, but for the most part they work well in getting the message across. This movie doesn't try to gloss over anything either, but it still doesn't pack the same emotional wallop as, say, the recent Queen movie - Bohemian Rhapsody. Perhaps that is because Elton John is still with us, while Freddie Mercury has passed on.I don't know how close this movie is to real life; a lot of the characters are painted with broad strokes and there is little nuance. Elton John himself is portrayed as some sort of child prodigy. Regardless of its veracity, however, I enjoyed this movie and am happy to suggest you give it a try. The acting is good, the story is interesting and the musical numbers are great.",Rocketman
189,anthonyjlangford,Biopic would have been better.,6,7 October 2019,"I grew up listening to Elton in the 70's as my auntie was a fan. Who could not love those fabulous songs?Personally it's not as successful as a musical rather than the biopic I was hoping for. It's a growing trend if not the norm. Don't let reality stand in the way of entertainment. Perhaps Elton himself may have insisted on this angle but the approach negates the story. Whatever that really is. Perhaps the truth isn't that interesting.Even a story as gritty as NWA's Straight Outta Compton overlooked facts for audience appeal. (Domestic violence).We'll probably see more of these half truthed packages. The Greatest Showman is the perfect example of froth over fact.I guess if we want the real story now we read Wikipedia but I'd still rather see it, and hear it, in a film. Those days seem to becoming further and further away from us. To our ultimate loss.",Rocketman
190,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Rocketman Soars...,8,2 June 2019,"First off, this isnt a very traditional bio-pic. It definitely is more a musical. But I really quite liked that. In comparison to last year's Bohemian Rhapsody which had good casting but felt like an average movie overall, this one just way more interesting and engaging. Taron's wonderful and its also great to see him actually singing (rather than lipsyncing). Although I personally really loved Jamie Bell in this who is such an underrated actor. He really made me feel for his character (or I guess real person). And directing wise, there's lots of really interesting shots. Also, I give it more props than Bohemian Rhapsody for the gay scenes. Although, I still wouldnt call it explicit or ""squeamish"" like one poster did.Of course its not perfect. There were a couple parts where the fantastical element went a bit far. There is literally a scene where Elton turns into a rocket. It was hilariously stupid looking. I also take some issues with some of the make-up jobs, and some use of green screen was super obvious. But overall, I was pleased with the movie.If you love Elton, then Im sure you'll be happy with the film. But even if you dont really know him or his music, I still think there is something in there for you. Not just because of the stylistic choices but I liked the message and themes about finding, loving and accepting yourself.",Rocketman
191,AdrenalinDragon,Reach for the Stars in this Musical Fantasy!,7,23 May 2019,"Rocketman is a fun biopic Musical/Fantasy movie that follows Elton John throughout his early years learning the ropes and gaining fame to become one of the biggest pop stars of all-time. It's not quite your average ""Biopic"" movie though. Rocketman features many of Elton's songs that are played relevant to the movie scenes and filled with stylish visuals and sounds that brings the legend to life. It feels like you are watching a theatre show live in places and gives the film an extra oomph to the whole picture. Played brilliantly by Taron Egerton, the movie delivers an emotional ride through the ups and downs of Elton's life and how you see him connect and develop with other people, as well as his own personal problems.Unlike last year's Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman thankfully does not sanitize Elton's issues and you see him get into drugs, alcohol, and homosexuality factors that give the character a real sense of depth and dimension to him. The movie is nicely shot and acted, as well as having very high production values in pretty much every category. All the singing feels natural and nothing feels too out of place. There is clearly alot of effort put into this film and if your a fan of Elton John's music, then you'll definitely get a bigger kick out of this than someone who wouldn't. However, I think on the story side of things this movie still works and doesn't need nostalgia or fan-service to coast on its success. Rocketman is worth the stars of admission!7/10",Rocketman
192,peeedeee-94281,Rocketman Fizzles Out,2,21 June 2019,"I'm not sure if I saw the same movie as everyone praising it. I thought it was okay, but definitely not an 8 or 9 out of 10.
There are many problems with this film. The main issue, which I didn't realize until someone pointed it out in their review, is that the magic of listen to Elton John singing his songs is missing in this one. If you compare it to a recent, similar film by the same director (half directed by him), Bohemian Rhapsody, we get to hear Freddie's voice. Malik lip syncs to it, but that's why we fell in love with the artist. Taron does a good job singing, and performing, but he's NOT Elton John, vocally.
Second issue is that it's tonally all over the place. It wants to be a musical, or it wants to be a drama, it can't be both. Usually musicals are more upbeat. But I think the placing of a music scene is critical, and it just felt very repetitive in this movie. In fact, I took a bathroom break during one of the middle music scenes because I didn't feel compelled to stick around. I felt the drama scenes were worth more to sit through. The uneven tone just kept kicking me out of the movie.
The makeup for Bryce Howard was horrible when she was playing the older version of the mother. It looked like all they did was make her face lighter, it was pretty lazy. And why was the step father/boyfriend not considered a supportive person in Elton's life. I get that the mother and father were not as warm, but the step father, in addition to his grandmother, seemed to be a pretty good father figure.
Ultimately, this film fails to make Elton a sympathetic character. At least with Freddie Mercury, we did feel emotion for him and his plight. With Elton, it just felt more like 'woe is me' x 20, i.e. over and over again. Then the movie ends, and you're like 'okay, what was the point of this movie?' There is no point, no message. We just watch Elton's life set to a Mamma Mia-esque framework, with mediocre results.

193,sirwillisiv,"A corny romp, but that's what's so amazing about it...",9,5 June 2019,"Unlike most biopics, Rocketman one dives into the psyche of Sir Elton John to present a radically upbeat and stylish musical that also takes time to breathe and explore his struggles with fame, identity and abuse.The musical sequences are a riot; beautiful sung and boasting fast-paced and captivating choreography. The effort really shows; its on par with La La Land. I found it a pleasant surprise because I went into the film expecting a dull, by-the-books documentation of a famous person's life, but was treated with a rather buoyant and offbeat approach to the genre. I'm sure it's been done before with other biopics about musicians I have yet to watch, but this is a first for me, and I loved it.Despite some moments of rushed pacing, a strong tone balance and charismatic performance by Taron Egerton makes this picture fly high and it's gonna be a long, long time before another biopic captures the raw spirit of its star artist.

196,Padreviews,All you need is love,7,22 May 2019,"There was a scene near the end that was near perfect and deserving of 10/10 but the rest of the film meandered too much to achieve that accolade .Warning don't go to see this expecting another Bohemian Rhapsody it's a completely different type of movie - it's closer to La La land or Mamma Mia on its jukebox approach to a musical film.Undoubtedly there will be a stage version of this it sets itself up for that . It's a retrospective film using many dream sequences that tackles the price of fame namely , sex drugs and rock and roll and hides no secrets of his sexuality- the male/male sex scenes might surprise some for their graphical content.The film could have been better but it's not a bad film - it's a good film - it's close to 8/10 but there were too many musical scenes where the songs were shared by various characters and not enough live performances . But they weren't all bad you can see them working in musical theatre it was just that they sometimes seemed incongruous in this film.The key relationship that lasted through the film was the brotherly love between his long term writing partner Bernie Tauren excellently played by Jamie Bell who for me was the star of the show .Apart from Bernie the only other person who loved and believed in him was his nan .The marriage to Renata seemed to be rushed and unexplained - it wouldn't have distracted from the film if it was edited out .Ultimately the film was the story of longing to be loved , loved by his parents , friends , lovers and the lack of achievement of that love and replacing it with drugs and alcohol .The story doesn't end with the present day but rather at a point in his life where he realises he needs to change his ways and we are left with an update on today in the credits .Pad.A 7/10",Rocketman

Rocketman (2019)Normally, I don't watch musicals. The dancing and singing always look out of place and do nothing but distract me from the plot. I couldn't imagine that Rocketman would be a musical so when they all started singing I automatically lost 90% of the interest. However, as it went along, I saw that this film is not simply a story about music and the actual ""musical"" elements are different from what I saw in other films.Rocketman is not on the level of Bohemian Rhapsody, simply because Elton and Freddie are different kinds of musicians. The objective here was to show his early life, his incredible talent and the choices that he has made along with valuable lessons that he learnt from them about the messed up world of music and people in general. Taron was outstanding and energetic as Elton aided by musical performances that were crisp, colorful and to the point instead of becoming 5 minute dance shows.A lot has been shown in the film and yet it feels like even more is missing with many interesting parts of Elton's career being omitted. Questionable story telling with the plot often jumping through time and forgetting the audience behind but that does not damage the film too much. The movie has a LOT of music and songs that make the 2 hours feel like 20 minutes of one big concert that makes this drama come alive.#moviesshmovies - Instagram",Rocketman
201,philthegreatone-786-63058,Rocketman,8,2 June 2019,"This Elton John bipoic which i just saw last night with a big crowd was a really great experience. It is part fantasy, part musical but never a straight forward biopic. Taren Egerton is fantastic as Elton he imbodies his flamboyant nature on stage. He also does well with the scenes before he becomes a star when Reg Dwight was a much more shy young man. The musical numbers are terrific and it is very well directed by Dexter Fletcher. It doesn't shy away from the down side of fame and shows the sex, drugs and rock n roll. Unlike last years Freddie Mecury biopic it doesn't pussy foot around the main character's sexuality. Elton was out and proud and anyone who loved his music didn't care, they just loved his music. The timeline goes back and forth between childhood, rise to fame, his downward spiral and eventually when he finally kicked drugs nearly 30 years ago. Edgerton's performance was really nuanced and layered showing great emotion and really enjoying the role. He deserves at least an Oscar nomination. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as his mother she was great, and has always been a great actress. I highly recommend this film one of the best of 2019... so far",Rocketman
202,Semisonic,Reflections of a rock star,8,15 April 2020,"A person in an angel-demon costume bursts into a room with people waiting for him, crashes on a chair and begins his confession. His name is Elton Hercules John, and his life is a mess.When we talk about biopics, it's very cheesy to use the word ""special"" to describe them. Obviously each of such films is special, because it shows us a story of a unique person, prominent in some way. However, Rocketman is indeed a special case, not just because of who it is about, but because how the story is told.Usually, the biography movies are focused on a person's achievements and milestones: did this, came there, won that. As if we went through his or her Wikipedia page sections, turning the dry facts into a sequence that's fictionalized enough to make the viewer engaged. The thing about this approach is that it's someone else, a screenwriter or a producer, who does the ""guessing"" part, trying to get into the protagonist's head and deduce his thoughts and feelings based on his actions. And whether that guessing was done right is usually an open question, either because the person has already passed away (like in the case of the recent Bohemian Rhapsody), or because he's not in direct contact with the crew.Rocketman, however, has Elton John himself as an executive producer. And from the very start of the film it becomes clear that this is gonna be a story told through _his_ eyes and imbued with his emotions. The whole AA-like rehab meeting backdrop creates a sense that Rocketman is a psychotherapeutic exercise for Reginald Dwight himself, his attempt to solve, or at least acknowledge, the existing lifelong conflicts and issues, and reconnect with his inner child, the latter even demonstrated explicitly, in a very direct but nonetheless touching way.Another absolutely fantastic feature of this film is how the musical elements are interwoven with the main narrative. Usually the singing and the dancing happens as some sort of a cut scene, which is somehow dictated by the current state of the plot but is generally something you might skip without missing anything crucial. Here, however, music _is_ the plot, the way to accentuate and convey the main moments of Elton's life, the songs' lyrics often given to the characters, basically showing us how this or that song was born and what it was inspired by. The visual sequences of such moments are fantastically surreal and organic at the same time, the Rocketman sequence being maybe the most complex, bizarre but at the same brutally raw act of cinematographic self-expression I've ever seen on screen. These four minutes simply take your breath away, and alone are worth spending two hours to watch this film.Is there a punch line? A moral lesson for us to learn? A late apology for not living up to someone's expectations? Honestly, I can't think of anything. The only curious fact I've learned from Rocketman is that apparently the guy who produced Elton John has also produced Queen at some point, and his characters from Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman are played by two different Game of Thrones stars and are shown in a very different way. Curious but utterly irrelevant. What's relevant is that music is and always will be for the living, for those who crave to express and to be heard. So live while you do, and love while you can.",Rocketman

205,PotassiumMan,"Campy, heavy-handed mess from the get-go",4,2 June 2019,"This highly-touted film about Elton John that blends the biopic and musical genres together has one big selling point: Taron Egerton's go-for-broke performance as the deeply troubled musical genius. Regrettably, the film as a whole is self-indulgent and cliche-ridden to the hilt and goes down as a misfire.Problematic right out of the gate, the film has to overcome a befuddling start which takes place from the tawdry vantage point of a psychiatric support group and frames the film's narrative from that trivializing angle from there on out. Perhaps a film of better nuance could have pulled this off but here we have camp, mawkishness and exploitation all rolled into one. The end result is a film whose tone is dumbfounding, annoying and at times embarrassing to endure. The musical numbers in this film are mostly perplexing and very rarely effective in conveying this life story.I am not one to criticize a biopic because I realize it's a genre that is beholden to the life it is portraying. While I don't question the film's accuracy in portraying how awful Elton John's personal demons were, a film with more discipline almost definitely could have done better. A campy film, one that keeps poking you in the eye with how bad it is, will not tell anyone's story all that well, let alone a legend like Elton John.Bearing in mind that Egerton's performance has to be seen to be believed, I nevertheless decline to recommend this.",Rocketman

This outstanding biopic blew me away by managing to both inform the viewer about the ups and downs of John's life in a wholly engaging and all-encompassing manner, yet also entertaining the viewer through absolutely dazzling musical scenes that manage to make the most of both the lyrics and subtext of John's lyrics.Unlike some other entries in the musical biopic genre, ""Rocketman"" manages to not only fully develop Elton John as a character, but also those around him. Bernie Taupin as well as Elton's parents make fascinating supporting characters with far more depth and complexity than supporting characters in similar films. The acting in the film is superb across the board, and Taron Edgerton truly knocks it out of the park as Elton. He displays an astonishing range and stays in total control of both the film's narrative and his music. Unlike many other similar performances, such as Rami Malek in ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" he does all the singing here as well, and he manages to nail that too! The film's music numbers are all unique and complement each other. They're well-choreographed and manage to be both escapist and substantial to the progression of the film's narrative and such associated plot structure. The film refreshingly doesn't sanitize neither Elton John's struggles with vices nor his identity as a gay man, unlike the watered-down content in the (PG-13) ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" This edge helps the viewer more fully understand the struggles that Elton went through in his life, and allows us to further empathize towards his character on screen. The film's production design is incredibly strong, combining both flashy costumes with understated British elegance and class--sometimes even in the same scene, in the case of the music numbers. I won't give away how the film does this, but I was also surprised by just how emotionally impactful it gets, as well as how the narrative truly feels like it builds up to a true crescendo. I think it's gonna be a long, long time before Elton John is honored again in a manner as unique as this film. 10/10",Rocketman

Firstly do you need to know of Reginald Dwight's story? , the answer is no. Do you need to like his music ? The answer is no. Do you need to like musicals? The answer is no. The main premise of the film we see Elton at his lowest point in rehab and counselling and it flashes back in a chronological order at his highs and mainly lows. There some wonderful moments here, when he first plays the piano, plays the LA Troubadour, the interaction with Bernie Taurpin his songwriting partner (who never gets the credit he deserves) where the film falls flat and we've seen so many times his the hedonistic lifestyle, similar to the Freddie Mercury biopic, and his awkwardness when his family mix in his new circle. Is the film any good, it's great from start to finish, all though I did get bored at his self centred poor old me attitude. It's a smash 8/10 and it's far better than Bohemian Rhapsody because Elton is portrayed in let's be honest not a nice light.The photos of where they are now is lovely to see and I felt more for Elton when seeing those snaps with his family know he's worked through all the crap in his life. Highly recommended and I do like his music, but then how can you not he has sung and written so many brilliant songs, and some stinkers.

I can´t say I paid to listen to Taron sing Elton´s songs.
2- This also reminded me a lot of Michael Jackson´s Moonwalker. Another senseless musical with a script made for children. It did have awesome musical moments though, but the rest was crap. At least they should have left Elton´s voice in the songs to at least enjoy those musical moments.The scenes are random also, so it´s also confusing. And Elton John levitating while playing piano??

Whilst watching the movie, I completely flatlined for a second and thought that I'm seeing the real Elton John on my screen.This movie is incredibly fast paced and did not have any tonal inconsistencies. The story moved surprisingly quickly and never bored me in any way. It felt like a 90 minute movie instead of a 2 hour movie.The cinematography in this movie is astounding. The costumes and the array of color perfectly encapsulates the essence and the general vibe of the movie. During an interview, Elton John concurred that he lived an R-rated life. Much to his dismay, the movie got a PG-13 rating.I never in a million years would have guessed that the actor Taron Egerton did his own singing. When I heard his voice, it felt incredibly familiar to Elton John's voice. It was pure joy hearing Elton John's songs again. My favorite song is Crocodile Rock. This song gave me such a tremendous ear worm.To conclude, this biopic ticked all the right boxes for me. Whilst not reaching the heights of the Freddie Mercury biopic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Rocketman"" is still a delight to watch. The movie will make you laugh, cry and jump up and sing and dance. It is an absolute must-watch.",Rocketman
215,droog-56936,Captain Fantastic,6,2 September 2019,This movie takes the fantasy elements of Bohemian Rhapsody and cranks up the myth making to ten. Visually stunning it's a delight for the casual fan but irritating for the hardcore. Fast and loose with facts and song timelines it's still entertaining enough,Rocketman
216,samyoung-82648,Superb!,10,4 June 2019,"I'm not a fan of Taron Egerton. He was absolutely amazing in this role, seriously good. During Bohemian Rhapsody, the illusion was often broken because Remy Malek just can't act (he just didn't capture the real Freddie). With Taron, all I could see was Elton John.This movie, while taking liberties, feels genuine. It really felt like the real deal.If you like Elton John and can handle some homosexual scenes, this is a stellar movie.Side note: I found out a close friend of the family was gay back in the early 70s. None of us were bothered by it at all. It's true that general social attitudes have changed, but, homosexuality was not such a big deal (think of Bowie/Jagger/Mercury - many of the general public knew they were bi/gay - i'd even go as far to say the 70s was more diverse than today by far).",Rocketman
217,shiguangmimi,I probably would not have liked it as much.,6,18 March 2020,"I really wanted to love this movie because I absolutely adore Elton John, but I just found it to be another story about the struggles of a rising artist. On the opposite hand, I still managed to like it. I think that it was creative and carried a great story no matter how cliche that might be. The thing that makes me like this movie is that it surrounds a friendship, which I do not think I've seen in any other struggling artist movie. Without that part of the plot and the musical approach to it, I probably would not have liked it as much.",Rocketman
218,schroederagustavo,Feel the energy!,9,20 June 2019,"I wasn't looking forward to this movie, because I thought this was just gonna be another musical biopic of one of the biggest stars of all time, his ascent into glory, how he gets lost in the booze, the drugs, the sex and then his final redemtption. This movie is that, but there's just so much more to it, particularly in the way that it's executed. Dexter Fletcher, the director of the film, really did a wonderful job at incorporating musical acts into the structure of the film, and it's done in a really creative and energetic way. It's not just, here's the life of Elton John, this happened, then that, it's way more creative than that and I loved it. Great performances all around, but man, Taron Egerton knocks it out of the park, fantastic performance that I was definitely not expecting at all. I liked him a lot in Kingsman, but I think this is the film that really makes his acting abilities shine and I'm excited to see what else he does in the future. As for flaws, I think I would really have to be nitpicking the film, but at the end of the day it is another biopic with the beats that you would expect. But it's in the energy and execution that the film really shines bright. I think they did a wonderful job at making us understand why things turned out the way they did with Elton and how much of a genius he is, but also how tragic his story is. I loved this movie and couldn't recommend it enough, it's excellent.",Rocketman
219,theredsky,Rocketman Review,8,12 June 2019,"This is a great movie. Rocketman is everything Bohemian Rhapsody should have been. Here are the very few negatives to this film. Some of the family drama does feel kinda forced. It doesn't take a lot away from the experience but it does feel odd. Some elements of the film are not entirely accurate. One such thing would be that the ""John"" in Elton John's name did not come from John Lennon. Rocketman had very few inaccuracies unlike Bohemian Rhapsody where they changed parts of Freddie Mercury's life to fit a story. The film does start to hit the same beats as every other musical biopic out there. Here are the positives. The acting is phenomenal. Taron Egerton does an outstanding job as Elton John. He embodies so much emotion into his performance and he is an outstanding singer. I am confident in thinking that Egerton's performance could be a possible Oscar nomination. Jamie Bell and Bryce Dallas Howard both do an outstanding job as the people who Elton cares about. Richard Madden does a great job as a manager and also the ""villain"" of the story. Even the child actors who portrayed a young Elton John do a great job. The musical numbers in this film are amazing. Each musical number has its own visual flare. They keep your interest and get the other characters and surrounding extras involved. Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman's musical scenes are intriguing. Costume Design and Set Design are also really good in this film. The costumes look almost exactly like the actual costumes Elton John wore. The sets just look amazing. The tone for the film remains consistent and the film is paced really well also. The narrative for this film is great. The film focuses on Elton's John musical skills, alcoholism, and drug abuse. Bohemian Rhapsody barely focuses on the effects of Mercury's drug abuse while Rocketman shows the effects of what happens with these substances. The film's structure is great. The story is told from Elton John while he is therapy and ends with him overcoming his problems.. While I do thoroughly like Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman is 100% the superior film. Overall, Rocketman provides amazing performances, outstanding musical numbers, and great costume design. I give Rocketman a 9/10.",Rocketman
220,joshbarton15,Taron Egerton is electrifying in this larger than life biopic of a true legend.,10,22 May 2019,"Having worked in the entertainment industry for an amazing five decades, it comes as a surprise that Rocketman is the very first biopic of such a colourful man and performer as Elton John. A string of hits and powerful personality has led to him influencing many that have followed, his legacy sure to live on for years to come.Rocketman is a retelling of Elton John's (Taron Egerton) fantastical life, from his breakthrough years to his struggles with depression, substance abuse and the acceptance of his sexual orientation.As soon as Rocketman starts, you know what sort of ride you're in for, Dexter Fletcher having a clear vision on how he wanted to portray the life of such a big character, by going big with the production. This isn't a conventional biopic by any means, Lee Hall writing it as a number of flashbacks amongst a group session during Elton's time in rehab. It isn't always big glasses and loud outfits mind as Fletcher and Hall work together, with input from Elton himself no doubt, to tell an unflinching tale of love, most importantly for yourself.Rocketman doesn't dance around the troubles in Elton's extraordinary life, his family life at a younger age setting him down the long and winding road to stardom that inevitably leads to plenty of drugs and alcohol, all while trying to navigate the homosexuality that first finds love, followed quickly by pain. It's funny when it needs to be but also incredibly touching at times.All of this comes amongst what I can only describe as a fantastical celebration of Elton's string of hits, the fantasy elements working a treat and suiting the man down to a tee. It's a proper musical by nature, so expect to be toe-tapping when he hits the big time with Crocodile Rock or even wowing a local pub with Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting), the musical numbers intertwined with specific moments in his younger life brilliantly.The musical numbers and Elton's story are major players in the film's success however, Taron Egerton's electrifying performance as Elton John is the real driving force in making this a stunning biopic. The singing is note perfect and the charisma really does ooze from the screen as Egerton, quite literally, becomes Elton. Seriously, there were a few moments where I thought they had chucked in stock footage of Elton just to mess with us but it was indeed Egerton, that's how good he is here.The supporting cast, Jamie Bell in particular as Elton's longtime songwriting collaborator Bernie Taupin, deliver alongside Egerton to make Rocketman stand-out amongst many other biopics. Richard Madden as John Reid delivers a juxtaposed performance that will really get under your skin while Stephen Graham nearly steals the show as Dick James, Elton and Bernie's first manager.There truly is no stealing the show in Rocketman mind as this is well and truly Taron Egerton's film. If Kingsman earned him a reputation as a rising star, Rocketman will make him a true star.",Rocketman
221,yettygutschow,Very entertaining fantasy representation of EJ's life,7,22 September 2020,"Great music, good acting and meaningful scenes in a broadway style movie that is, most of all, entertaining on many levels. I've always been a fan of EJ's music and this movie is a great tribute to his career.",Rocketman
222,intrepidami,Rocketman : A love letter to Bernie Taupin,9,4 July 2019,"A very honest portrait. I never realized how personal the lyrics were. It tells his story through the songs. The performances are very strong.All through it though, there's Bernie. Who became his brother. Closer to him than anybody else. Its shows how amazingly strong their bond was. It pulls at your heartstrings when Bernie pleads with him to just go away with him, and get back to the best part of their lives, when they lived together, collaborating.It doesn't shy away from his quirks. His being a diva at times.His sessions in group are very personal. His journey to sobriety was very uplifting.One of the best biographic movies I've ever seen.",Rocketman

But at least he took action and changed from drug angry homosexual to a homosexual becoming a family man and doing something right. Story was great. Taron Egerton played Elton John perfectly.The presentation and love making scene made me feel very uncomfortable. Certain scenes were excessive, messy, and cartoonish. I like his songs but it's takes away the seriousness of the movie. I felt like watching Grease.Overall this movie is for the Elton John fans. For me it's a mixed bag.",Rocketman
224,Morejambo54,Hmmm...,5,25 December 2020,"It's alright. I really didn't like how much of a musical it was. There was a sad scene that instantly turned into a fun and happy song, this really took me out of the movie. Another thing that felt stupid was when someone would start singing mid sentence, maybe it's just because I don't like musicals...but it was rather annoying. The music is obviously good and the acting was great there was just so many things that pulled me out of the story and got me thinking only about the songs, which is the main part but I came for a movie not a collage of music videos. The ending was pretty bland also, another sad and depressing scene turned into a bright and happy song. Then it ended, just like that. The movie is enjoyable though I just personally prefer more realistic movies such as bohemian rhapsody which was executed superbly. I can understand how and why people enjoy it as much as they do. 5/10",Rocketman
225,domtaylor,An entertaining musical that's let down by following the music-biopic formula too closely.,7,7 September 2019,"'Rocketman' is a pretty entertaining Elton John biopic, but unfortunately it's just that: a musical biopic. While it does differ from the majority of them as it's a straight-up musical as opposed to just featuring on-stage performances, every beat of the narrative is very generic and therefore predictable. This means that for all its different qualities, its generic traits actually overcome them leading to a film that's unfortunately much more forgettable than it should be. Like I said though, it is definitely entertaining in the moment and the musical sequences are well-realised and enjoyable. Egerton is great in the leading role, too, and holds his own in the singing. Actually knowing that he is performing the songs himself really adds to the believability of the whole thing and doesn't just make it seem like an old album is playing over a mime act. In the end, this is probably one of the best examples of the music-biopic thanks to the fact that it's trying to be something different. Unfortunately, though, that's not enough to overcome the traditional trappings of the genre, leading to a picture that's enjoyable in the moment but ultimately rather forgettable. 7/10",Rocketman
226,rcolgan,"Sex, Drugs and Elton John",8,26 May 2019,"When watching Rocketman I couldn't help but compare the film to last years Bohemian Rhapsody, especially since director Dexter Fletcher ended up taking up the reigns to finish the chaotic production of Bohemian Rhapsody following Singers departure. Whereas Bohemian Rhapsody shied away from showing some of the more controversial moments in Mercury's life and seemed unable to live up to the larger than life presence of the band, Rocketman doesn't try to back away from Elton's R rated life and is infused with the kind of energy which an Elton John movie deserves.The story is the same kind of music bopic you've probably seen before in something like Ray, Walk the Line or Hard Walk: The Dewey Cox Story. Following a difficult childhood, an artist becomes one of the biggest stars in the world. However the stresses of fame mixed with their own personal problems leads them in to a life of addiction and push away all those they care about. This forces them to fight their own demons to overcome their struggles and find happiness in their life. I don't know whether I should criticise Hollywood for not greenlighting more original biopics or music prodigies for living such similar lives.Though what differentiates this story from a standard music biopic is Elton as a character. Whilst there's always a slight concern when the subject of a biopic plays a role as the producer of his own movie, since they may attempt to force a romanticised version of themselves to the screen, it's clear that Elton doesn't have a problem in showing the painful moments of his life or the darker side of his personality. Instead he embraces his pasts mistakes and own them as part of how he became who he is today.Another major part of bringing Elton's personality to life on screen is that Edgerton may have been the best choice they could have made for playing him. Beyond nailing his look, he seemed able to switch between the emotional wreck that he was in his personal life in to the hypnotic on stage charisma so naturally. In one of the films best moments we see him broken down and exhausted about to step on stage, before breaking in to a smile and a happy march the moment that spotlight hits him. With this and the comedic skills he shows off in the Kingsman series, he's definitely an actor who I'm curious to see where their career is going to go.But you couldn't have an Elton John movie without an Elton John Wardrobe and the movie does not disappoint. From the moment he steps on screen dressed as a sparkling devil, with wings so large you'll wonder how made it through doors, to the hundred other costumes we see Edgerton wearing throughout, the film this ends up being a greatest hits compilation of both Elton's music and his outfits.Unlike some other music biopics, this movie doesn't try to just copy Elton's musical performances. The filmmakers are smart enough to know that no matter how good Edgerton is, there's no way they could just use Elton's songs as it would never live up to just watching a concert film of Elton performing. Instead they claim their own versions of these songs, blending Edgerton's great voice with a style more similar to a stage musical to give them a separate identity to Elton's. Combine this with the impressively executed dance sequences, which similar to La La Land feel like modern day versions of a classic Hollywood musical, these sequences stand apart from Elton's as their own entertaining versions.The film mixes these great sequences with a constant kinetic energy which flows through every scene, moving song to song and blending scenes together seamlessly. Especially later on in the film, where Elton's drugged out state leads scenes to transition into one another at times like a dream and at other times like a nightmare. Though at times the film carries this momentum to a fault, with scenes moving so quickly that we hardly get a chance to breath before the films already moved on to the next song.We do also get a slightly rushed ending, with all the loose emotional plot threads in his life being tied together in a single scene and leaving us with a brief Animal House style of cliff notes for how the rest of Elton's life went instead of something more creative like a montage showing us the rest of Elton's life. But even with this, Rocketman is both one of the best music biopics and a thoughtful look on the self-destructive effects of addiction. I just hope that every future music biopic is given the same amount of care and thought as this film has been given.",Rocketman
227,KeremUlucay,CRAZY,7,27 June 2019,"Rocketman is a biopic which preferred to tell its story like a musical. That's awesome because there are some crazy and spectacular scenes. But in second half, it becomes boring. Tempo is great at all but before final sequence it falls. In final, movie shows itself and everything becomes better when we hear Sir Elton John's voice. Taron Egerton is amazing. He lives in the character. Also his singing is so much better than I expected. By the way, lots of people compare Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody and that sounds so normal to me. If I say something about that, although I liked them both, Bo Rhap is better with one or two steps.",Rocketman

The makers of this movie have chosen to present the story in a partly fantasy style.""Rocketman"" shows various highs and lows of Sir Elton's life ; his rise and popularity as a singer / musician and his struggles with issues and elements such as drugs, alcohol, and his sexuality. The acting, writing, and singing in this movie is top-class. Taron Edgerton is excellent as the on-screen version of Sir Elton John. His performance is almost flawless.

230,seanhmoss6,Not for me...but it seems like a really good movie,5,8 January 2020,"I had the same problem with Saving Private Ryan. Originally, I left the theater with about 20 minutes left. Took me about 3 years to finally see those 20 minutes. Sometimes, I just don't really care about the movie. That said, I don't have to like something in order to recognize how good it is. I've never been a fan of musicals. And personally, I didn't care for where the screenplay was headed pretty much from the jump. But it is Elton John and his music and story. And that Egerton kid is very talented and does justice with songs that I believe are made for anyone with a voice to sing. But he does them Elton and I have to say Taron justice. I only made it about 40 minutes in. That doesn't mean it's not a helluva a movie. Just not for me. Watch it!",Rocketman

I came into this film expecting another cheap reproduction of a successful musician's career to capitalize off nostalgic middle-aged moviegoers. I was pleasantly surprised with how the film artistically retold Elton's life though. It is fresh, lively, and nearly as crazy as he is. You'll get all the greatest hits from his discography here, save maybe Candle in the Wind. The choreography for some of the numbers is magnificent. I'm so very impressed at the delivery on some of the tracks. It brought the sold out theater I was in to sing along many times. I was compelled to clap after some of the performances myself. I am so glad this movie did justice to the legend that is Elton John and I hope it continues as part of his indelible legacy.",Rocketman

234,chong_an,Great Musical - But where's the love?,9,24 May 2019,"Elton John fans should see this movie. If you know very little about EJ and his music, it may make a lot less sense to you.Elton Hercules John checks himself into rehab. In a group therapy setting, he recalls his life as a musical fantasy. There is his childhood, unable to get affection from his father. There is his mother, who, while supportive / accepting, warns him that his lifestyle will leave him without true love. There is his fortuitous collaboration with Bernie Taupin, and his relationship with his manager John Reid. There is his increasing reliance on alcohol and drugs (both prescription and illegal), eventually leading to rehab.EJ's music is everywhere, highlighting the emotion of the moment. It could be an instrumental excerpt of a hit, a snatch of some lyrics, up to full song-and-dance numbers, including some more obscure songs. The songs are well performed by Taron Egerton as EJ, Matthew Illesley as young Reggie, and other cast members. The music may not necessarily be chronological, but serves the story, rather than stop and supplant it.My references for this review are last year's biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, and Alberta Ballet's Love Lies Bleeding (a ballet using EJ's music and inspired by his life story). Rocketman beats Bohemian Rhapsody by several counts, including the use of music, and in not shying away from the main character's homosexuality - EJ and John Reid are shown being passionate with each other. The ballet, meanwhile, is a wonderful interpretation of EJ's music, but dance does not allow for narrative.Here is where Rocketman lost its one point of rating. The ballet (based on when it was written) ended with EJ meeting David Furnish and finding love. Rocketman ends with EJ leaving rehab, and shooting the music video I'm Still Standing. His meeting and marrying Furnish, and having kids, are relegated to postscript text. This is the ""normal"" life that he had been denied, and thought he could never achieve, but this part of his life is very de-emphasized. Maybe at 2 hours, there was already enough movie (sequel, anyone?). Given that Furnish is listed as a Producer and EJ as an Executive Producer, they must be OK with the story arc. But I do wish for a personal (and not just musical) happy-ever-after ending.",Rocketman
235,cappiethadog,Ada and the Jets,6,17 June 2019,"""And the wind said: 'Remember how we used to play?"" Ada McGrath(Holly Hunter), a mute Englishwoman, signs to Flora(Anna Paquin), her daughter, on a far-flung beach in 19th century New Zealand. ""Then the wind took her hand and said, 'Come, come with me,'"" Ada continues, as they wait for her husband, an enterprising homesteader, inside her own crinoline that she refashioned as a makeshift tent. Flora is her collaborator; the mother and daughter form a partnership, in day-to-day life and in art. Ada scribbles prosaic things on a small notepad she keeps chained around her neck. Flora is her voice in the oral sense; she's the wordsmith. The daughter is a storyteller. She tells her stepfather's housekeeper that Ada, an Austrian opera singer, was married to a German composer. They were rehearsing in the drenched forest, oblivious to the downpouring, because ""so passionate was their singing,"" according to Flora, that they didn't hear the thunder. ""Mother never spoke another word,"" after father was struck down by lightning. Flora is lyrical. ""The Piano"", the 1993 Palm d'or-winning film by Jane Campion, has for a heroine, a piano woman whose music does all the talking. The daughter's stories are proto-lyrics, inspired by Ada's music, whereas in Dexter Fletcher's ""Rocket Man"", it's the musician, Elton John(Taron Egerton), whose compositions are sparked by Bernie Taupin(Jaime Bell), the 1992 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee who would have poeticized Ada's hand gesturing into this: ""And they whispered into your brain,"" a line from the 1974 song about Marilyn Monroe, the one with the chorus; ""And it seems to me, you lived your life like a candle in the wind.""""Candle in the Wind"" is from Elton John's seventh album ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", the third single that somehow failed to chart, despite following the wild success of the title track, a number one hit; the songwriting team's third in a row. It's this song, the elegiac ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" that Taupin sings as he walks out of a restaurant after an attempt at reconciliation proves to be futile. ""So goodbye yellow brick road/Where the dogs of society howl/You can't plant me in your penthouse/I'm going back to my plough,"" which are his words, not Elton's, even though ""Rocket Man"" treats them as if they were. For instance, ""The ***** is Back"" is staged at an AA meeting: ""I was justified when I was five,"" he recounts to the other recovering alcoholics, in what turns out to be the film's prologue, because Eggerton passes off his vocal duties to Sebastian Rich, while he watches his nine-year-old self(Matthew Illesley), back when he was Reginald Dwight, growing up in the lower-middle-class milieu of suburban Middlesex. Originally, the ""*****"" in question is probably John, but the film coopts Taupin's lyrics as code for his cold and distant father, Stanley(Steven McIntosh), a ""*****"" who is ""back"" from a business trip. Taupin must have undergone an identity crisis at one time or another. Quite tellingly, at the 1978 Science Fiction Awards, he introduces William Shatner's spoken word interpretation of ""Rocket Man"" as ""MY rocket man,"" which not coincidentally, took place during the period when he and John took a break from their songwriting partnership, following the poorly received ""Blue Moves""(1977). It's not hard to imagine that Bernie took a taxi straight from the USC campus straight to the meeting with his estranged partner right after Shatner was done. Neither man can admit that they need each other. At the awards ceremony, Taupin wanted the world to know that he played a key role in Elton John's ascension to superstardom. Very subtly, ""Rocket Man"" acknowledges the lyricist's hurt feelings of being underappreciated, since ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" makes reference to Victor Fleming's ""The Wizard of Oz"". Elton may be the ""Pinball Wizard"", but if you were to pull back the curtain, there would stand Bernie, writing his resignation letter: ""Maybe you'll get a replacement/There's plenty like me to be found/Mongrels who ain't got a penny/Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground."" Elton John, in a sense, left Oz, too, and recorded two Taupin-less albums: ""A Single Man""(1978) and the disco-inflected ""Victim of Love""(1979), both panned, especially the latter. The ""Pinball Wizard"", as it turns out, was an amalgamation. Elton found himself back in Kansas, so to speak. ""Oh, I've finally decided where my future lies/Beyond the yellow brick road."" Six years after the platinum-selling, thirty times over ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", Taupin's words smacked of prophecy.Music is a language. Ada's husband Alistair(Sam Neill), the unofficial king of Auckland, doesn't understand or doesn't care that the piano is his newlywed's voice. The colonized Maoris, who make up his convoy, haul everything but the piano, her primary form of self-expression, back to the village. The other white man, Baines(Harvey Keitel), adorned with tribal face tattoos, because he ingratiated himself within this tribe of indigenous New Zealanders, agrees to reunite Ada with her instrument. They reach the beach. The mother plays; the daughter dances. Flora is her muse. Together, they form a creative team to be reckoned with. Ada's composition suggests this couplet: ""Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand,"" as she performs for her small audience along the shoreline. Flora cartwheels; her dancing is lyrical, expressing the interconnectedness between mother and child: ""And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand."" But times being what they are, the mid-19th century, the two ""girls"" can't escape the tyranny of men. Baines, opportunistic and libidinous, is like a proto-groupie. The two men barter. Baines obtains the piano. He wants to sleep with a musician. Alistair, similar to Elton John's manager John Reid(Richard Madden), drives a wedge between the fertile tandem. Across centuries, therein lies two men who don't love properly; both musicians are treated like property. With John, it's the money that he makes for his manager/lover, and as for Ada, it's the love that she makes; lovemaking as an act of slavery, resulting in either a child and marital love(Alistair), or a lovechild and romantic love(Bailey). Platonic relationships, in both instances: parent/child and musician/poet are severed, resulting in a lost finger for Aida and the lost potentiality of hit songs for John/Taupin, in due part to the machinations of scoundrels.Ada sides with the Maoris; her piano is too heavy for the canoe. They're right. The canoe's progress to England will increase exponentially without the ballast of the cumbersome instrument. It's time for a proper Viking funeral. But what is the Victorian woman thinking? The pianist plants her foot in the center of the looped rope, so when the piano is given the heave-ho, the woman follows; woman overboard. Ada's kindred spirit of sorts, Elton John, likewise, attempts suicide by submerging himself in water, too, albeit, on a smaller scale, a swimming pool. Unexpectedly, John's drowning is the visual cue for ""Rocket Man"", in which the singer-songwriter sees his child-self seated at a tiny piano on the pool's bottom. Taupin describes a patriarchal world when he writes: ""Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids,"" if you prescribe to the notion that Mars is ""masculine"" and Venus is ""feminine"". Ada knows this first-hand, that it's ""in fact...cold as hell,"" despite the temperate climate of the tropical rainforest in Karekare. The piano, for Ada, is ruined, like her left hand; the missing finger, she thinks, will impede her ability to play. On one of the white piano keys, Ada had inscribed: ""Dear George, you have my heart,"" but her identity is tied to that piano, maimed like her, which would be fine if being some man's wife outweighed the sensation of accomplishment and self-worth she gets as a musical composer; an artist. Taupin's words: ""And there's no one to raise them if you did,"" uncannily doubles as the mother's mind voice, remembering Ada does, that Flora would be left alone to explicate Mars' compositional subtext, Venus, without the music of a mother's maternal love as a guide. She frees her foot from the loop, inspired by the idea that being a parent is enough reason to live. Elton John's suicide attempt can be explained from a different section of ""Rocket Man"": ""And I'm going to be high as a kite by then."" If John died in 1975, ""burning out his fuse up here alone,"" he would have missed out on meeting his two sons. Speaking in strictly platonic and also, songwriting partnership terms, Bernie Taupin may have birthed ""Rocket Man"", but he was not a hands-on mother; Taupin was just the lyricist. Elton John fulfilled two roles, the father and surrogate mother; that's what conscientious composers do. The two men were never in the same room for any of their collaborations. John worked alone. Bernie wrote the lyrics, and literally mailed it in.""Tiny Dancer"" is a queenly song. It's the working heart in ""Almost Famous"", Cameron Crowe's autobiographical films about his time as a cub reporter for ""Rolling Stone"" magazine. Everybody remembers the singalong on the tour bus that breaks the tension between Russell Hammond(Billy Crudup) and his Stillwater bandmates, who resent the lead guitarist's perception that he's ""a golden god"". Penny Lane(Kate Hudson), the self-described ""band-aid"", as everybody knows, is the ""blue jean baby"" with the ""pirate smile"". What people forget is that Crowe used a second Elton John song, ""Mona Lisa & Mad Hatters"", an album track from the 1972 album ""***** Chateau"". William Miller(Patrick Fugit) loves Penny. The song plays over his mad search for her in the dense streets of New York City, peering into taxi cabs, going out of his mind.""And I thank the lord for the people I have found,"" writes Taupin, sings John, and resides in William's soul, when the paramedics pump the quaaludes out of her system in a lonely hotel room bathtub.",Rocketman
236,emryse,"Slightly Worse Mama Mia, Slightly Better Bohemian Rhapsody",6,5 May 2021,"I watched Bohemian Rhapsody slightly before watching this and was massively disappointed by it, after watching that I expected this film to be even worse due to the ratings but was actually pleasantly surprised. Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody this film is much less stuck in realism and embraces Elton's flamboyant personality, resulting in a much more fun film, filled with small music videos and some great costumes.It's pretty similar to Mamma Mia in terms of how the songs fit in with the story so if you don't like that film this probably won't be for you but if you want a film that you can turn your brain off to and just enjoy this will be a pretty decent bit of viewing.",Rocketman
237,stevojaxon,Rock a doodle do,7,30 December 2019,"I suppose Rocketman had to be made. It reminds me of some of the other biopics that have been coming out in the last couple of years. The producers of these movies have probably been noticing that other movies featuring other artists have been popular. So I guess they've decided now is the right time. Strike while the iron is hot as has been said. I watched it to the end and I enjoyed it. The music is there. Flamboyance aplenty and English accents in abundance. There's drama, pop star excesses, synchronized dancing and fantasy scenes. What more could I want? Well, there's a whole lot of things that I wish for that aren't going to happen, as it's now been edited and released. What I secretly want is a movie that makes me give it a 9 or 10 rating. The significance of the artist is that he is a 9 or 10 artist who has had an important influence over the music scene. After all, he really is in a league of his own ... virtual rock and roll royalty. Wouldn't it be nice if the movie truly reflected this? ... my opinion only of course ...",Rocketman

242,Dello_,If only I were a fan...,8,8 March 2020,"""Rocketman"" is a very solid movie, with great direction, acting, music and choreographies. My main problem with the movie is that I had never consciously listened to a Elton John's song. I saw the movie because I wanted to watch a good musical that could entertain me for two hours. And this film does a very good job in doing so but I lost a lot of emotional weight because I wasn't hyped up by the songs themselves. This ""Rocketman"" is clearly better than ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" but since I am a Queen fan I liked more that one. So if you are an Elton John fan ""Rocketman"" is a must watch. And if you aren't but you want a solid movie with music and dancing this one is a great choice!",Rocketman
243,ccamp89,Strong 2.5 // Breathing Room,5,11 August 2019,"I'm no expert on Elton John, but in learning what I have about him through this film I've come to realize that two hours really just doesn't cut it. To do a story like his justice you need time, time to develop his character, sculpt the family dynamics, probe the internal and external conflicts, and, most importantly, time for the audience to digest such a meteoric rise and devastating fall. There's so much ground to cover and so many moments to address that the film feels like a highlight reel rather than the character portrait it seems to be striving for. Friendships, relationships, and conflicts are introduced and left behind at a speed that ultimately distanced me. It's not without its charms, though. There are some resonant tunes and flashy setpieces that manage to entertain, though other musical numbers fall decidedly flat with somewhat sluggish camerawork. It'd be interesting to see what a more visionary director like Damien Chazelle could've done with the material. As is, it's a mildly pleasant experience with a strong central performance that does a lot to carry the weight. The compact narrative just really lacked the breathing room it needed to resonate.Strong 2.5/5",Rocketman
244,garethvk,An Amazing Film And Oscar Worthy Performance By Egerton,10,31 May 2019,"Elton John has had a career that has spanned decades, millions of albums sold, packed venues, awards, and more than a few headlines. In the new film ""Rocketman"" audiences get a look behind the man thanks to the amazing and Oscar worthy portrayal by Taron Egerton.The film opens with a flamboyantly dressed John entering rehab in one of his stage costumes. As he opens up with his group, he shares the story of his childhood as a shy child who is desperate to have his father show him any signs of approval or affection.When it is discovered that he has talent with the piano; his grandmother encourages him and even takes him to apply for a position at the Royal Academy of Music.His mother (Bryce Dallas Howard) is moderately supportive but is more focused on her social life brought on by her failing marriage.As the film unfolds; we see Elton working in a backup band and in time answering an ad that puts him with an agent. Paired with the man who would eventually change his life; Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), Elton and Bernie combine to write a series of songs which in turn leads him to a series of gigs in Los Angeles. The film shifts into high gear at this point as we see how their music becomes a smash and leads to a series of parties, drugs, and money.Elton meets Manager John Reid (Richard Madden), who becomes his partner both socially and professionally as Elton embraces his Homosexuality which he has kept largely hidden.As the record sales and hits mount, so does the destructive behaviors which leads Elton down a destructive path that threatens everything he has worked for.The movie is a masterpiece of music and story and it cleverly uses musical montages and segments around the performances to outline various segments of his life and his rise to stardom.The performances are amazing and Egerton was simply amazing as he not only captured the complexity of his character but performed all the vocals of the hit songs himself and they were spot on.During our Press Screening I noticed many people singing along, tapping their feet, or bobbing their heads along with the music which helps to underscore just how timeless and popular his catalog of music has been as the songs have endured the test of time.The film also evokes some unexpected emotion as there were more than a few people wiping their eyes during the film which at its core is a store of a young, shy boy desperate to be accepted and loved.I truly hope the film is recognized come Awards season as it is a wonderful and memorable cinematic experience.5 stars out of 5",Rocketman
245,CriticalOfEverything,"As far as biopics go, especially musical ones, this is great!",8,10 June 2019,"I don't want to reveal much about this film but really, if you like Elton John it's almost a given you'll love this movie. This movie manages to capture the highs and lows of Elton's life amazingly and it's all topped off with great covers of Elton's greatest hits with the perfect actor to play him. Taron Egerton does a wonderful job. Please see it, that's all I'm gonna say.",Rocketman
246,valen060,Uniquely Done and Impressive Performance By Taron Egerton,9,7 June 2019,"In the wake of previous music biopic Bohemian Rhapsody with Rami Malek as Freddy Mercury months prior, RocketMan is a welcoming addition in that genre and worth looking into regarding music great Sir Elton John. 'Kingsman' star Taron Egerton portrays the legend with such a unique performance that he's basically not trying to imitate or impersonate him by look or how he sang, but an embodiment of what Elton went through in his lifetime with its ups and downs.His costars Bryce Dallas Howard, who portrays his cold-hearted mother was quite troubling to watch, including the struggles of finding his calling in life during the 70s and 80s. Whereas actor Jamie Bell as longtime friend and lyricist Bernie Taupin was pretty uncanny. Whether it was performing for small crowds, meeting people who would give him his big break (and ultimately one betraying him at one point), addiction, or a self-identity he would establish on his own altogether, he would find his way around.I say that this is a music biopic that seems to capture the essence of how Elton John came to be. Egerton's way of singing some of his hit songs was worth listening to and that he seemed to have captured it flawlessly. I sense awards season has a place for him and this flick.If Sir Elton was able to earn himself a Best Original Song Oscar for 'The Lion King' back in the mid-90s, I think there just might be room for Taron Egerton to earn a nod as well.Although this movie depicted how troubling his life was in the beginning - including a few fictional moments that is likely meant to keep the story going - there's always that glimmer of hope that can only be achieved your own way.",Rocketman

248,Benslie,Hooked from the beginning to the end,9,2 June 2019,"First of all, Taron Egerton and Kit Connor were amazing as Elton John. Kit Connor plays him when he's a kid and you barely see him but he just leaves such an impact that it's great. It also helps that he looks like a tiny version of Taron. Now, Taron Egerton is just amazing as Elton John and he helps make him seem like a normal human which is hard for somebody like Elton. As I was watching him I got so invested into his performance that at certain points I actually was starting to tear up all because of his performance. He also, at the request of Elton John, did all of his own singing and it's amazing. I really hope that he gets a nomination for his role. Jamie Bell, who plays Bernie Taupin, also did a great job. Instead of just using the songs as if he was recording them the movie used them to help transitions from one point to another and it was really clever. The music was used to help montage parts of his life and show what was going on in his life. This was definitely the best option because if they didn't do it then the movie probably would have dragged out longer. This movie is two hours and one minute long and honestly, I never felt it dragging on for too long. Each moment in his life felt the appropriate amount of time spent on it but there were certain points that I wished they would have spent a bit longer on. The one thing I would've added in though is little title cards that say what year it is because it got a little confusing at times what year it was and how much time has passed since the last scene. Like I mentioned earlier in this review the story got me emotional and that's because of how the film felt like a fly on a wall throughout his life and showing the ups and downs he went through and honestly you can't watch this movie and not just want to help him out. All of the costumes in this film are hands down spectacular. You can see how much care and work went into making these costumes look as accurate as possible to the real thing. In the end, this movie does an amazing job of showing the like of Elton John and definitely not holding anything back. I highly recommend watching this even if you aren't a fan. I give Rocketman a 9.5/10.",Rocketman
249,GavWaskett,What does Elton John say to mediocre jokes? It's a little bit funny...,5,13 September 2020,"This is a tricky one to review, I was not that interested to begin with, but Shell really wanted to watch it, so it was a Sunday afternoon film choice. I think the cast is excellent and it is directed by Spike from Press Gang/Babyface from Bugsy Malone, so I was very happy with that. Elton John has never floated my boat, he is undoubtably talented and has some great songs, but as a person and a story - it is just not something I ever thought about.Taron Egerton is amazing as Elton John, he is a such a talented actor and now singer, he really does seem to shine when he is acting in a biography(he made Eddie the Eagle a superb film as well), he really throws himself into the roles. Jamie Bell is also fantastic, he is one of the most underrated actors in my opinion and the friendship between Elton John and Bernie Taupin was brought to life by these two and shows what a special relationship these two have and no wonder they produced some of the classic tunes of the last 40 years. Bryce Dallas Howard is also amazing as his mother and completely unrecognisable, she is also one of my favourite actresses, so the casting is perfect for me.Mr John's story is also really interesting and shows how sad the man really was in those early days and how he has changed his life and turned his fortune around. It is the story of bravery, desperation, being an ass, but being vulnerable, the story of someone who had the world to offer, he just needed the people around him to do just that. And I am very happy for Mr John that he has a wonderful family and friends now.Though I'm not a huge fan, the film reminded me of what great songs Bernie Taupin wrote and Elton John put to music.However, the film takes some every weird turns when the music starts and they go into this fantasy land, I'm not sure if that is Dexter Fletcher's direction of Elton John's influence, but for me it took something away from the film and the story rather than add to it.It is worth a watch but for me, once is enough and though enjoyable it is not great. If you love Elton John, I am sure you'll really enjoy this. However, if like me you aren't a fan but were interested in a film with a great cast which could tell a good story, then... you know what I really don't know what to say, I enjoyed it but not a great deal. If you're bored give it a go. A 10/20 from me.",Rocketman

251,robertmaybeth,"Some fine story elements, but in an unusual mix that's alternately exhilarating and almost mundane",7,3 June 2019,"After seeing ""Rocketman"" I firmly believe this film has a sizable target audience - and I'm not in it. And perhaps that's exactly as the director intended.From the beginning, we are led on a few false starts, on what type of movie this is going to be. Is it a musical? At first yeah, later no. Is it a biopic? At first yeah, later, no. Is it a coming out story? You get the idea.Where the direction and the acting succeeds is portraying the conflicts inherent in one man's story of massive musical talent, world-class wealth, deep-rooted parental issues, and life lived in the public eye as a closeted homosexual. But the character's narrative, while very strong, is often not only uneven, but uses production values that at times are much too sparse. To me, the budget constraints were frustratingly obvious during much of the film and detracted from the story.The actors are all stellar and because of this, the strong performances are what gives this film the power it has. Particularly good were Bryce Dallas Howard, as Mum (Sheila Dwight), and Richard Madden (Robb Stark in ""Game of Thrones"") as Elton's treacherous lover Jon Reid. And Taron Egerton's powerful portrayal of Elton John utterly steals the show, in an Oscar-caliber performance.But as I tried to describe, this movie is not perfect, and the events and themes shown in ""Rocketman"" are not for everyone. The themes of the gay life-style and homosexual relationships are at times quite graphic, and might make some viewers very uncomfortable. And for that reason, the R rating for ""Rocketman"" is to be taken seriously, especially for viewers with young children.",Rocketman

Also the music connections to what he was going through at the time - well done. Learned so much about his life - two uncaring and incapable of caring parents, but thank heaven for his grandmother since she was the only one in the house who encouraged him.
Another movie about the hard time a gay person has when trying to be themselves. Yes it deserves the R rating and I am glad Elton Joh insisted that he had not led a PG-13 life.

1. I liked some of Elton John's work but found his production after ""Yellow Brick Road"" repetitive and lacking.
2. Don't really like musicals; I can go through My Fair Lady, South Pacific, Show Boat or Paint Your Wagon with some pleasure but it (usually) stops there.
3. Didin't know diddi about the production.Thanks in earnest to the people that insisted me to watch it: **IT IS ASUPERB PIECE OF CINEMATOGRAPHY!!**The casting: it is one of the best I've seen in ages! You glide through the film like you are immersed in real life, not in a _musical_, acting, by ALL, from the main characters to the last extra is so good that you forget you are watching actors, not the real people portrayed. Again the genre ""Musical"" keeps unnoticed from start to end but, then again, the music is sooo good that you don't want it to end.Hats off to the director: he spins such a fine hand with the cast and crew that you simply do not know he was there.Last but not least: Taron Egerton, whom I didn't have heard mentioned until this film gave a completely lifelike performance, with all the bright and dark of the complicated character. To boot, I had to wait until the final credits to learn _he sings all the pieces. Until that moment I thought they were studio clips.Do watch it; highly recommended.",Rocketman

I have always admired Elton John as a performer so when Rocketman was released, i made sure not to miss it. And i am glad i didn't. What a treat for a fan. The songs from the first half of his career are in the movie, woven seamlessly into the storyline so that this really is a musical biopic. The actors do a great job, especially Taron Egerton who sings just like the Man himself; the portrayal is really on point. Songs like Crocodile Rock and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road transported me back to the days of my youth. Thanks for the memories!",Rocketman
257,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Rocketman: launch or misfire?,9,7 January 2020,"On the surface, there will be many comparisons between Rocketman, opening May 31, starring Taron Egerton as Elton John, and last year's box office hit Bohemian Rhapsody, which starred Rami Malek in his Academy Award winning performance as Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury. These are obvious comparisons: biopic, 1970's-1980's time period, flamboyant musical superstar, struggles with sexuality, well-known and infectious tunes, tragedy and triumph. While that seems like a lot of similarities,Rocketman takes a very different path than the otherwise straightforward recapping of life events likeBohemian Rhapsody.It is right in the tagline on the posters of Rocketman: ""Based on a True Fantasy."" This film is a rousing, jukebox musical with Elton John's songs weaving in as the story unfolds, infusing the various set-pieces with emotion, depth and ultimately a lot of entertainment. If you are expecting a biopic, forget it. Start thinking musical. The characters sing to each other in Elton's songs. For example, there is a sequence where Elton, his mom, grandmother and estranged father are sitting in separate parts of the family home singing to the audience. Another sequence is when Elton stalks through a party singing ""Tiny Dancer"". These fantasy sequences use the laundry list of hits to uniquely tell this story that could have been another been-there-done-that movie.Taron Egerton, who is best known for the Kingsman movies, brings a brash energy to his portrayal of Elton John. Egerton has a great voice and he does an admirable job suggesting John's singing voice without trying to be a carbon-copy. The performance goes from young, vibrant, talented and arrogant to balding, isolated, and damaged, struggling with fame; and, Egerton hits every note just right without missing some of the humor in it all. He seems to be having a ton of fun show up in crazier and crazier costumes, some very iconic. While the film is a showcase for Egerton, the remainder of the cast is uniformly good, including Jamie Bell as John's writing partner, Bernie Taupin, Richard Madden, who best known from Game of Thrones, and Bryce Dallas Howard, as John's mom. And, they all sing!Now, the film does get a little episodic as it goes along though it never feels like it is dragging. The plot points are still there like any other straightforward biopic. Plus, you know Elton John survives in the end and continues to be successful and respected. If people breaking out in song in the middle of a scene puts you off, then maybe be cautious about going to the theater on this one, but I really think that it is worth at the very least a matinee price because the makers of Rocketman really were thoughtful about putting the greatness of Elton John front and center in using his music as punctuation to the man's life story. For Elton fans, musical fans, and for anyone desperate to see people try something new with stale formulas,Rocketman is worth the money.GO SEE IT!",Rocketman

If this was Taron's big chance to prove he had pipe what a let down. He sounded so amateurish. In fact the whole movie was amateurish.
Not at all what I expected from Elton's camp. If he did approve this, bad on him, if he didn't than he should fire whoever recommended it.
If you want a penny's worth of a bio pic, go for it, if you want something worthy of this man's contributions, then wait for a real writer to do it! This movie, in my opinion sucked big time!",Rocketman

260,helenbassett,Rocketman Film Review - Dexter Fletcher Directs Taron Egerton In Elton John Crystals As He Hits A Dodgers Home Run,10,5 June 2019,"Having helmed Bohemian Rhapsody to Oscar success Dexter Fletcher is once again in mission control for Rocketman, with Taron Egerton donning the platforms and glasses. In 2013 I saw Sunshine On Leith, Dexter's first film, and loved it. He clearly has a handle on musicals. Giving plenty of the old razzle dazzle. Exactly what Elton John has. Funnily on holiday recently I met a guy who had actually been at school with Elton; then the young Reginald Dwight from Pinner. Was he always someone that stood out?, could you tell he would be a star? I asked. In fact he thought that Reg was just a fat kid with glasses who had no foreseeable signs of greatness. Well looks can be deceiving because look at him now. I may one day even forgive Elton for that shameful Snickers advert. That may have broken my heart!Taron was excellent, as were all the kids as Reggie. I first saw Taron in Eddie The Eagle, then Kingsman, Sing and recently in Robin Hood. He has the voice and isn't afraid to don the feathers for a romp through Elton's back story. The script by Lee Hall and produced by David Furnish was always going to be sympathetic to Elton. But this is no Pg-13 story, as Elton said, his life was R rated, and there's no hiding in a chicken suit; he wants it to be told. And promptly checks his tangerine ass into an AA dream.Unsurprisingly the film has the feel of Billy Elliot, also written by Lee Hall, with a gorgeous rousing bop through the mean streets of middle-class Pinner. (My old stamping ground!). Elton's fantasy started with talent, a tune picked out on a piano by Matthew Illesley as the young Reg, and a Gran, played by Gemma Jones, who was interested in her grandson. Mum played by a love starved and almost unrecognisable Bryce Dallas Howard, and an emotionally clipped war damaged father played by Steven Mackintosh, almost sink Reggie's early promise. Singing their own solos of unhappiness. And with his start in life Elton deserves every joy he now has. Shy young Reggie just wants a hug.A tinkle on the ivories by Kit Connor as the teenage Reggie at the Royal Academy of Music, and a nice moment with Harriet Walter, playing her classical piece by ear, what a precocious talent he was even then, leads Reg to rock and roll and adulthood, where Saturday Night Is Alright For Fighting. And a life on the road with a band.Lovely Charlie Rowe as Ray Williams gives the reinvented Elton an envelope of lyrics in his bosses Denmark Street office, see if you can make something of these. Songwriter Bernie Taupin is Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell and they come up with songs. Dick puts them in front of his boss, the terrific Stephen Graham's Dick James, of Dick James Music. Their music is rubbish, but Dick, pushed by Ray, sees potential. With Your Song they're on a trip to LA, and gigs at the wildly flamboyant Tate Donovan's Troubadour club. The stakes couldn't be higher, with Elton locked in the toilet and pop genius's in the audience. But he takes off as the gig defies gravity. If it feels emotional it's because it is, the papers are full of Elton's success, and he storms the charts.Bernie is the songwriter in the shadows, I know nothing about him, I guess that's the way he wants it. Elton is the flamboyant showman with diamond shoes, loving and loved by his lifelong writing partner, even after they (never) row. And while Jamie's Bernie was a straight A kind of guy, I vehemently disliked John Reid, a dastardly Richard Madden. In this R rated film of Elton's life, this guy was a Class A dick. But a totally believable dick, the manager muscling everyone else out, and in his sharp suit getting his 20% of flesh, in more ways than one. The same guy from the Bohemian Rhapsody story. A real Killer Queen. And pushing Elton to the limit. But there is no spending limit, Elton is a millionaire. And forcing him to come out to his mother, who like all mothers, already knew, but condemns his lifestyle choice to a life of never being loved. And sending him in his Rolls round to the now happily re-married, once more with feeling for old times sake Dad?, okay still stiff upper-lip father.The music of the partnership plays like a greatest hits jukebox, that accurately, naturally!, matches the highs and lows of Elton's life. The melody of a tune we all know, tried out for the first time on a piano. How amazing that Elton could see the notes to fit Bernie's words. And how emotionally stilted were those around who couldn't see him.In my youth I remember 'I'm Still Standing' as my first intro to Elton John, with the video and jazz man outfit, Taron edited into the original, and the unhappy first wedding that added respectability to the flamboyant Elton. John Reid whispering in his ear again. Funnily it was 'Don't Go Breaking My Heart' with Kiki Dee that brought Elton and John together again, after their first meeting in LA.All of Elton's music is virtually on repeat on the radio so feels so fresh. And because I don't remember them the first time around, I don't care about the ipad shuffle of songs and dates as much as the purists. It's as if they were written only yesterday, and yet Elton has been a titan of the music industry for 50 or so years. His life has been one of strops and petulance, with Class A wild living and sex orgies, and trying anything once, as he swallow dives into the pool! And yet what a man that has made him. Maybe he was never really there. But Bennie and the Jets would beg to differ. He used to be so wild, but now we can call him Sir.With costumes by Julian Day, from the black and white childhood to the fun you can see he had recreating those wild designs, as Taron looked so precious in over a million Swarovski crystals. Gorgeous cinematography by George Richmond and music by Matthew Margeson. Riffing on Elton's back catalogue down the yellow brick road.An outrageous technicolour ode to excess with Dorothy ruby platforms, and I loved it.",Rocketman

The entire movie is obsessed with showing us what a victim he was...people treating him badly and how all these awful things made him resort to drugs, sex, and self hate. ""It wasn't his fault!"" Meanwhile, he's the center of the world's attention and making millions. There is not one ounce of joy in this movie. Being a fan of Elton John, I think the movie missed the mark badly by not using Elton's own voice during the songs...the movie needed the brightness and joy of his voice.",Rocketman

His influence on music with his soul-rock-pop-country-blues genre mashing is still understated in real life, I reckon.
Didn't ""resonate"" as much as Bohemian Rhapsody but I think that's cause the man is still alive!
My artsy fartsy comment is that you're going to find it very tricky to use one artistic medium (movie musical) to create a piece of art as an homage to someone who has already made a much, much larger impact on the world in another medium - popular music. It's like paying tribute to the 100m sprint by doing a good long jump - if you get what I mean.

In his book Elton even manages to gets laughs out of some of the tragic situations, demonstrating an amusing turn of phrase along with the ability to tell a self depreciating anecdote and set up a punchline, the movie is unable to match this.I'm sure the process of making the movie was more great carthartic therapy for Elton, not so enjoyable for me though.""Artistic licence"" they call it, I say bah humbug!Read the autobiography ""Me"" instead and get the full picture.",Rocketman

I loved it. The telling of the story is much like the film Bohemian Rhapsody where the story follows Reggie's life growing up, his obvious natural talent, his collaboration with songwriter Bernie Taupin and the demons he chased as an adult in a life of fame, money, drugs and lovers yet ... such terrible loneliness. I didn't know this side of his life and I feel all the more grateful he gifted us with so much, when he himself felt so alone.The film is not all sad. It's done is such a delightful way. Elton John's songs are distributed at pivotal points in his life and the film switches momentarily to a choreographed musical filled with great dance moves and costumes. I adored this style and it was so well done, the film is reminiscent of the older well done musicals. Honesty, I can't remember a decent musical since Victor/Victoria by Blake Edwards in 1982.I laughed, shed a tear but mostly was thoroughly entertained at watching this depiction of the eccentric and talented life of Elton John.",Rocketman

273,dan_slentz,Great acting.. Excellen soundtrack.. Interesting movie!,8,2 June 2019,"Don't go into this movie expecting a biography style flick... but expect something closer to a musical or even a rock opera like ""Tommy"".
First, Edgerton's acting and singing were top notch!! This movie used music to transition time and place, and had a lot of fantasy aspect to it. It IS the story of Elton John's life and climb to fame, but not painted as a pretty picture in any way. It doesn't gloss over his lifestyle and actually contains some pretty explicit scenes related to this lifestyle, but it's part of the realism of his life. It's interesting the dynamic of the movie and what is based on reality, yet with scenes filmed that were ""fantasy"".
The updated versions of Elton's excellent songs remade by Edgerton were in no way disappointing. In fact, as a former radio announcer (playing these songs hundreds of times on the air), Edgerton really REALLY did the songs justice! Just a phenomenal job covering Elton's songs, but with a really nice twist to these ""altered covers"".
There movie was really well done and they did an awesome job recreating the 70's in set and design. Visually, it's stunning work.. and in most other ways, you'll get lost in the movie (which shows the film makers and production crew really paid attention to detail and did a great job all together).
I think fans of Elton John will love this movie (and will certainly feel for him and what he went through).. I gave it a 7. Great job to Taron Egerton on the acting AND singing!!",Rocketman
274,jaywensley2004,See it to hear it,8,19 June 2019,"""Rocketman"" is a weirdly surreal telling of a true story. But what makes it exceptional, and worth seeing, is the new arrangements for familiar songs.The songs as performed by the star of the movie, Taron Egerton, are much more than covers. They are new versions of resonate hits, evocative of the source material, while bringing new elements that suit the vignettes to which they are set, even if they are completely out of chronology for the timeline of the story.Essentially, ""Rocketman"" is a mediocre movie in which the story elements are interstices between outstanding music videos. But those ""videos"" are worth the price of admission.",Rocketman
275,amirmustafaa,Taron Egerton is Incredible...The Movie is Just Okay,6,1 September 2019,"It was an interesting choice to actually make a musical biopic, but the choice doesn't really pay off. As a musical, it somewhat lacks energy and it doesn't use John's catalog to full effect. As a biopic, its unfocused and lacks depth. We get no indication of what time the scenes take place in, some parts feel rushed, and Elton John's personal struggles don't have the emotional effect it should've had. To put it simply this movie wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be a fantasy musical and a expansive biopic but it doesn't really work as either.With that being said, Taron Egerton is incredible in this movie.

The film is very good overall , but i thought the musical within a musical in some scenes was overused and a little pointless, richard madden as elton johns manager -john reid ,of game of thrones and the bodygaurd seemed miscast in this , i thought his performance was wooden and annoying, but taron edgerton gives a believable performance as elton john , and his singing as elton isnt bad either! would like to watch it again when it comes out on blu ray . 👍 eltons still standing!",Rocketman

Taron Egerton turns in a performance of amazing range that both achieves impersonation while delivering a fully-believable cinematic character.

Unfortunately, when he took them off, he looked more like Kevin Spacey.What disappointed me was the movie itself. I was expecting more of a documentary of his life and career, but it is purely a musical set to the music of Elton John, The chronology was off and I do not believe there was a complete song in the entire movie.

287,jmholmes-73727,"FIRST HALF NOT BAD, SECOND HALF RUNS OUT OF STEAM",7,9 June 2019,"The screenplay misses the mark in two important ways: the framing device of Elton's therapy session shows him wearing one of his freakishly garish costumes, the surreal touch meant to reflect his determination NOT to be ordinary - but all it really does is allow us to not take him seriously and see him as a bit deranged, compared to the other patients in the circle. An opening scene showing him removing the costume, make-up and glitter and walking into the therapy session as a reluctant but ordinaryfellow would have been an improvement. The other mis-step is the fact that the section showing him drowning in drug abuse and alcohol drains the energy and life from the movie itself, not merely from poor Elton. And there is not a big comeback moment for him following his re-habilitation, certainly nothing comparable to the final moments of Bohemian Rhapsody. No doubt Mr. John or his ""people"" had some input on the direction this project took and the choices that were made. It just seems his wonderful music deserves a much better movie.",Rocketman

I felt that the the storyline itself seemed a bit manic in places, but I think this helped portray the drug and alcohol problems that plagued him in those days.I liked how they linked the songs to the story, though they were not strictly in chronological order for Elton's life, they helped capture the events and feelings of what was happening on screen - although I think it seemed out of place when others joined in singing lines of some songs, as though they were written from their perspectives as well as from Elton's.
I liked throughout the film how they recreated Elton's outlandish costumes, showing clips at the end alongside real images to show how similar they truly were.I especially liked how they recreated the music video for I'm Still Standing with Taron Egerton at the end.For a film called Rocketman I had expected them to make a bigger deal of its namesake song, but as I left the cinema it was Yellow Brick Road playing in my head.This definitely is not a documentary of Elton Johns life, but I think it does capture what he was like back then, the trials he had to go through personally and professionally and while the film was not as good as I was expecting, it was enjoyable.",Rocketman

I doubt it would have been so successful without Elton's role as executive producer - without his agreement, few directors and producers would have been brave enough to include some of the material shown. And the film is so good as a result of that.As with most musical bio-pics, one's enjoyment of this film is heavily influenced by your liking or otherwise of the subject's music. And there is a lot of music in this, beautifully captured by Taron Egerton who did all his own singing.Unless you're a close follower of Elton John's life and music, there is likely to be a lot of things you didn't know, even if you might have guessed. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it brought back many great memories of 1970s and 1980s parties accompanied by Elton's distinctive songs, and a couple of wonderful concerts from that era and later.The locations, cast and pace of the film worked well, and it had a wonderful ring of authenticity.

293,kingbk-2,"Love Elton John, Thought the Film was OK",6,18 April 2020,"Reginald Dwight grew up in a loveless home on the outskirts of London. A shy, musical prodigy who could play classical pieces by ear, the only support he finds is from his Grandma, who encourages him to develop his gift. Ignored by his Dad and shunned by his Mom, Reggie takes delight in Elvis Presley records and decides he wants to not only pursue music, but rock music. From forming his high school band Bluesology to meeting young lyricst Bernie Taupin, Reggie's career takes off. Eventually he changes his name to Elton John (though the movie lies about how he came up with the name for some reason), adopts a flamboyant stage persona complete with gaudy costumes and loud accessories and becomes one of the biggest rock stars during the 1970s. As success grows, so too do bad habits, leading a fast downfall and the question if Elton John would ever regain his fame and popularity that he had in his heyday (which, unless you've lived under a rock for the past 30 some years, you know the answer to that question).I will give this film credit. Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which carefully protected some of the more dark elements of Freddie Mercury's life, John lays bare all his warts and short comings. He had a lot of demons and darkness during his career. However, the overall execution is spotty. It can be campy at times, which fits with John's stage persona during this time, but sometimes it goes way beyond, to the point where it's uncomfortable to watch. The actors are good and some of the scenes are very powerful, but then others fall flat. I also would have liked maybe cutting down on some of the stuff (maybe shortening the musical numbers. That ""Saturday Night"" number goes on way too long) and touching on his ""revival"" in the 90s, when he did the duet with George Michael, wrote the soundtrack for The Lion King and wrote the biggest selling single in Billboard history with the Candle in the Wind tribute to Princess Diana. Nothing from this timeframe is shown in this movie, and it would have been a good conclusion to the darkness and despair that is throughout his life in this film.Overall, better than some of the bio pics I've seen, but some weird artistic choices leaves it lacking in some areas as well. If you like Elton John or rock music from the 70s, watch it. If not, you might want to pass.",Rocketman

As opposed to Bohemian Rapsody, this movie is based on his work and hearing his songs in the context of his own life is a great twist.

Well, Rocketman is everything that the other wasn't: extraordinary performance by all the actors, spectacular script, great direction and scenery, drama and empathy for the characters, the drama with his parents is very emotional, they dive into his homosexual relationships and drug addiction. The director (Dexter Fletcher) is the same as Bohemian: it was Bryan Singer but Fletcher finished it. Another thing that went well is ""the musical"", Bohemian or A Star Is Born were not, they were about singers and that's why there were songs. I don't like the musical genre but this one is very good. The songs are very well integrated to what he tells us. In the end it feels long and stretched. ""The Lion King"" o ""Sacrifice"" are missing.",Rocketman

305,Pzachlen,Great acting all around,2,4 June 2019,"However, from the first second this film started it seemed untrue, false, calculated, and so damm plastic. One can not blame the actors, all shinned, especially, Bernie.
The directors vision I fought with every step of the way. Nothing seemed organic or Real. It was not the imagination ,but the lack of anything exploring a deeper meaning than that which is obviously vulgar and garish.I am happy to say I worked with him on the film Tommy. I did not see the man I remember meeting in the mid 70's in ROCKETMAN. Taron was not to blame, He pulled out all the stops and was fantastic in the role but mis-cast. He was much too handsome and thin to portray a fat unattractive guy.
I also got tired of him needing to be a victim and bad wigs. Knowing of his admiration for Princess Diana and how that must have left him numb,I could not believe it was not part of this.",Rocketman
306,adamsandel,A dazzling reinvention of the musical biopic,9,13 January 2020,"This musical fantasia gives a giddy jolt to the predictable musical biopic genre. Taron Egerton's performance as Elton John is simultaneously playful, vulnerable, dark, joyful, and damaged. You can't take your eyes off of him.Instead of the traditional ""and then this happened, and we had this big hit"" structure of most of these films, the musical numbers here burst out of the action the way beloved pop songs burst out of our own emotional memories.In a year of lumbering, overlong movies, this is a dizzying joyride with heart and soul and rock and roll.",Rocketman

Genuine goose bump moments, one hum dinger in a early first major performance.A hell of a strong cast, with really too many to mention, the casting of Taron Egerton as Elton was genius.This is a moving story, which flew past and really is as good as the reviews imo.

Don't get me wrong I love musicals but like i feel like if they went the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" way I would have given 10 out of 10 but for some reason I wasn't a big fan of the musical aspect of it.

It really explores the challenges with fame and is quite open about the personal challenges that Elton faced and this is very interesting and not all that known. I've never been much of an Elton fan but it really made me reappraise and respect him as an artist even if his stuff is not really to my taste. Egerton was quite good but perhaps not the perfect Elton. Definitely worth a watch. But probably only once.",Rocketman

He experienced a great deal of pain and neglect.Yes his life long friend Bernie, wrote the songs. Elton John had the music and his friend put the music to an actual experience Elton John was going through at the time. Alcohol and drugs pledged Elton John and it is a important part of the movie. The pain he suffered in life and how he tried to self medicate is a journey worth watching in this movie.",Rocketman
311,suicidea,"Entertaining and watchable, though far from reaching its potential",8,27 August 2019,"I'm not a fan of Elton John. Let's get that out of the way right away. I've always liked pretty much every one of his songs that I caught on radio or TV, but I never bought any of his albums, can't even name one. But I heard of and read about him everywhere when I was a kid growing up, on his heyday. So this movie looked like the perfect chance to know him and his music in detail.It's impossible not to compare this biopic with Bohemian Rhapsody, since they are very, very similar in style, structure and pacing, and director Dexter Fletcher (he'll forever be Soap for me) is involved in both films. Freddie and Elton John were even friends in real life.Rocketman is, when you look at it objectively, even more entertaining than Bohemian Rhapsody as a film, but it still falls into the same traps. Granted, a feature movie is naturally limited in its running time, so we can't expect to see every detail about these artists' lives. But it still feels kind of weird to watch them go from up-and-coming novelties to worldwide rock stars in the span of one and a half minutes (with nicely done montages) while on the other hand, so much time is spent on the addictions and the partying lifestyle. It's almost like it's not a movie about Elton John the musician, but about Elton John the addict.The gay ""love"" scenes leave you scratching your head as well. We all know that Elton John is gay, and we also know that two men kissing and loving each other is the norm that Hollywood is pushing lately. But really, do we have to see them going at it in such detail? You don't have to be homophobic (I'm not) to find these scenes cringy and uncomfortable. Oh well, I guess the next biopic about a gay rock star will have hardcore scenes in it. The great late David Bowie, perhaps? (If they can find anyone that looks like him, of course. Even David Bowie didn't always look like David Bowie.)But the pluses of the film outweigh the minuses. The music is immensely enjoyable, and the lead actor Taron Egerton, whom I admit I hadn't even heard of before, gives a performance that's stunning, to say the least.I also have to congratulate Soap for something else. The AA meeting scenes which intercept the story are not distracting, and even the final scene where Elton meets the ghosts of his past, so to speak, and hugs the little Elton, are done well. They'd probably look extremely cheesy and cause more laughter than emotion in another film, but here it works.",Rocketman

I loved it.. I was also impressed with Bryce Dallas Howard.. it sinked in within an hour of the movie that I was watching Ron Howards Daughter LOL, she looked great and nailed that British accent to the T.....

Great sound track, don't get too hung up on the chronology details and you'll be fine.If you grew up listening to Elton your whole life and hearing bits and pieces of fact and fiction here and there, but want to hear it from the man himself, then by god, buy and read his book, it's really a page turner.The film collages many aspects of chronology into certain important times in his life and the book gets better detailed that spread out the emotional impact into reasonable morsels more in line with a real life being lived and survived.

319,OlgaGorelik,"It's trying to be magical, but I could see the strings",6,16 January 2020,"There is a scene towards the end of the movie in which young Reggie Dwight (Matthew Illesley) asks for a hug and finally receives one - from the grown up Elton John (Taron Egerton). That scene is a perfect illustration of why this film should have been great and why it ultimately didn't work for me. At its core Rocketman is by the numbers musician's biopic - early natural talent, meteoric rise to fame and fortune, alchohol and drugs, an abusive partner/manager that nearly gets him killed. I felt like I saw that same movie last year. Luckily for the filmmakers, Elton's songs not only provided ready chunks of the script, they also made those moments when characters burst into song almost organic. I cringed when characters other than Elton would start to sing though. This would work in a stage musical where you expect everyone to sing. And it does sometimes works in movies. Here it felt weird. The dance numbers, though disappointingly generic looking, did manage to illustrate the mood of the moment. Most of the time. The problem is that in order to make a movie that injects fantasy into reality like that one needs to do something akin to magic. There are times when the movie achieves precisely that, like the attempted suicide scene in the pool. But too often what we get are these obvious symbolisms, which I personally dislike. People lifted off their feet by Elton's performance. Elton gradually removing parts of his elaborate costume - he is peeling off the layers of fake persona and revealing the real person underneath. And the scene I mentioned in the beginning - Elton hugging his young self - look, he learned to love himself. It's like they are trying to do magic, but I could see the strings.",Rocketman

Elton John typifies this extravaganza, although his tunes are melodic, they dont reach my ear.Elton John has a talent for a certain type of melody that doesnt reach my musical ear at all.Just recently on social media, Paul McCartney said that his inspiration and motivation for songwriting was Rodgers and Hammerstein.Through their 18 years collaboration and partnership, Richard Rodgers had no musical training, but could write music seated at a desk, and when with Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, Oscar's lyrics always came first, then Rodgers would write the melody, and truly beautiful melodies they were.Reginald Kenneth Dwight is Elton John's real name, so im wondering if he had kept his real name and kept to wearing conventional clothing, would his music have caught the imagination of his fans around the word ?When it comes to pop music, you can't beat the 60's, including Tamla Motown, the songs had heart.In my view Reginald Kenneth Dwight would never have got off the ground, I am not touched by his melodies, they have no heart in my view.",Rocketman

With Elton John serving as executive producer, his story is told in a sophisticated manner. The musical aspect falters in the aspect of certain actors singing. Despite minor flaws, the musical aspect works really well in the film as it progresses the story with visual presentation and song choice. This film transitions really well, with cinematography mirroring that of a broadway extravaganza. The CGI in this film is terrible, and downright embarrassing for a blockbuster. The actors portray their roles very well, and become unrecognizable as they sink into the people of Elton John's life. Taron Egerton is the standout in this film, as his portrayal of Elton John is spot on and incredibly respectful (unlike other biopics). The music and audio aspect is incredible (it's Elton John, duh). Overall, this is a cool film that successfully meshes fantasy and reality with the brilliant art of Elton John.",Rocketman

That's not the path the producers and director chose. Instead, they used his music to tell his story. I think it works brilliantly.
Taron Egerton does a fantastic portrayal of Elton. I'm glad he chose to sing the songs himself instead of using the originals. We see him grow from a shy, confused man to the country's biggest musical act, to his fall from grace, and then rising again.
I forgot how insanely influential Elton's music was, as well as how many fantastic and beautiful songs he and Bernie wrote.

Queens film was an honest chronilogical acount of the band and Freddy Mercury.This film does not. Its exagerated to the point ya dont know what is true or flat out made up. They also bounced constantly from either telling a story normally or just busting into a musical number for no reason at all. The filmmakers relied heavily on the audiences love of the music, not the quality of the story telling, and sure as heck not on the terrible over acting.I think their main goal was to ride off the coat tails of the Queen film. Cram as much of Eltons music in as humanily possible. Now having said that, if they wanted to do an artistic interpratation using his music, like they did with the beetles and Across the Universe, that would be more accurate. But calling this a biopic, and further insinuating that he wrote all of his hit songs in 3 minutes....yeah, 3 minutes. Its a flat out lie.i feel like they betrayed their audience, for a cheap buck.

Making it a musical and deftly incorporating the songs into the narrative, combined the with the visual style, reinvented the rock n roll biopic in my eyes.This should probably the template for these things for the next 20 years until we get sick of it as well, but for right now it's a welcome change of pace.",Rocketman
329,TwittingOnTrender,"Rotten Peaches, rotting in the sun.",3,13 June 2019,"Many user reviews here point out that the pre-publicity for Rocketman was misleading and that it's not a biopic, it's a musical, so I won't harp on about that. Nor will I labour the comparisons to BoRhap, because that's been done to death too - I'll just say that the Queen flick was vastly superior and possessed far more integrity.
No, what this movie is is Elton John's love letter to himself (with the aid of Furnish, who is a producer in the same way that Linda McCartney was a keyboard player). Reg has insisted it's ""warts and all"" - ""I haven't led a PG-13 life!"" but these warts come covered in a thick layer of foundation and blamed on everyone else in his life other than himself. Reg ""settles all family business"" in this nasty hatchet-job on his mother, father and anyone else who tried to give him a leg up (and a leg over).
As everyone agrees, Egerton is excellent. Some of the numbers are well-staged (though every time the dancers started their jitterbugging, I couldn't help thinking about the Young Generation, the dance troupe who used to appear with Rolf, Lulu, Cilla et al on Saturday nights. Michael Clark this is not - it's bland, family entertainment - dare I say it, not even PG-13).
A lot of people wonder why the movie claims Reg got the ""John"" part of his stage name from John Lennon, rather than (as actually happened) Long John Baldry. Obviously it's because the makers don't trust the audience. The kids who know Reg from The Lion King would not have a clue who Baldry is, whereas they may just have heard of Lennon. Similarly, the lyrics of Rocket Man are changed from ""I miss my wife"" to ""I miss my life"" - absolutely shameful.
Of course, it's going to be a monster - Reg's publicity machine has made sure of that. The magazine and newspaper owners desperate to have him on the cover, the reviewers craving an interview, the chat shows pleading with him to appear, all have their snouts in the trough and Reg keeps topping up the swill.",Rocketman
330,Jac23443,Do not watch this drivel...,1,26 May 2020,"One of the worst films I have ever seen, right up there with the rebooted trash heap Beauty and the Beast and Les Misérables. The archaic musical style this movie used ruined the entire film because it all felt so fake and stylized. There is no redeeming quality for this film at all for me.This is officially one of the worst films I have ever seen. Most actors are awful, the editing is awful, the cinematography is boring and lackluster, and the whole movie just had a Broadway, or stage play feel to it.In my opinion, it failed on every aspect but one, which was Taron Egerton. His voice was surprisingly great but that could not save this mess. This film would have done a fantastic job if it had focused on the dark tones a bit more without the musical take. The reason I say this is because after watching masterful films like A Star is Born, or Bohemian Rhapsody, the oldies classic musical number thing just didn't feel right given the subject matter. For goodness sake Elton John has dealt with the abandonment of his father, growing up with a resentful mother, being taken advantage of, his support system, so it just didn't feel right at all.I realize that those films have nothing to do with this one, but in a way they do because they took a story of life, about music and they merged the two very well. The films worked because characters had chemistry, and the performances were superb, the cinematography was fantastic, song choice and story focus were spot on or emotional or meant something. Those movies rose to levels this movie never even scratched the surface of... this movie was just an overinflated, clusterf&#k, this whole movie was just absolutely painful to watch.",Rocketman
331,HairyMart1,Elton the Truth,7,1 June 2019,"Not just a biopic of Elton John, but a musical biopic. This may sound blindly obvious but it does not follow the regular formula of lead character strumming guitar or taping at keys on piano, then music swells and film throws another classic tune at you. No here it's delivered in full blown musical mode - street full of people bursting into dance, non-musical characters bursting into song, even people floating as songs connect with them. Just relying on auidence good will on the basis of great songs, will not be enough, and here you have Taron Egerton showing he can not only act but has a pretty good singing voice as he performs those classic tunes. It also has the advantage with the main protagonist still being alive, and clearly wanting not to hold back on his own personal demons that shaped his character. So often in uncompromising ways we see the dark journey that he went through to achieve his fame, and the real cost it had on him and those he loved. The magical musical realism that the film uses to tell his story works well for the most part, but I did find that it relied on some knowledge of his life story that im places did seem to be rushed over and not quite as clear as it should have been.",Rocketman

But behind this there is a moving story of Eltons childhood and early life in the music industry that he clearly was not mentally strong enough to steer clear of.A good watch and very touching, although each will make their mind up of how much this was self inflicted or otherwise.",Rocketman

The film is a mixture of musical and drama, which tells all about of Elton's beginning from when he was a child to when he became a legend.

338,WillsFilms,Rocketman Burns Out Its Fuse,8,4 June 2019,"Rocketman is amazing. This film does an incredible job of showcasing the life of Sir Elton John in an interesting way. Throughout the movie, you feel genuinely sympathetic about Elton's struggles with drugs, alcohol and the people in his life not caring. Taron Egerton is incredible as Elton. He delivers a very layered performance, showing off a variety of different emotions, while also having a beautiful singing voice. Jaime Bell is also great as Bernie Taupin, Elton's close friend and songwriter, as well as the most likabile person in the movie, along with Elton. Bryce Dallas Howard delivers an incredible performance as Elton's mother; Sheila Eileen. Howard does a great job of making you absolutely despise the woman she's playing. While it's difficult for an actor to make you love a character, it's also just as difficult for an actor to make you absolutely loath a character as well. Another actor who does a great job of making you loath his character is Richard Maddern, who plays Elton's manager; John Reid, who I wanted to punch in the face once the movie was over. The movie functions sort of like a musical, by using the songs to help tell the film's story. At several points in the film, Elton and the people in his life will start singing one of his songs to convey the emotions they're currently feeling, like in a musical. I found this to be a very clever way to incorporate Elton's songs into the movie, as it's far more interesting than just having Elton peform the songs at a concert, which would be the obvious way to do it. The film's cinematography is also stunning. It perfectly captures the grand, heart pumping atmosphere of Elton's best performances.If there are any flaws I have with this movie, it would be that some parts of Elton's life are skimmed over pretty quickly. Primarily Elton's relationship with his wife; Renate Blauel, which comes and goes in about five minutes. I understand that it probably wasn't as important as other parts of Elton's life, but I could have used a bit more development. However, a few minor pacing issues are really my only problem with this movie.Overall, This film has phenomenal acting, wonderful cinematography and a very clever use of beautiful music. My only real problem are a couple of issues with the movie's pacing. I definitely believe that this film will nominated for Best Picture and Best Actor For Egerton at the 92nd Academy Awards. Rocketman deserves a very high 9/10, though I'm debating whether or not to change it to a 10/10. It really is that good. I highly recommend checking this film out.

I expected it to be a bit like Bohemian Rhapsody, but I knew that it would also be very different. Now, this is a great film. Taron Egerton is absolutely amazing, I'd previously seen him in other movies but he never delivered such a stunning performance. Dexter Fletcher is a truly amazing director and the screenplay was also written beautifully, keeping the viewer on the edge, something not often experienced in biographies. I absolutely loved it! I enjoyed every single second of it and I was quite stunned that it had ended so quickly. Will most certainly rewatch. I feel like it won't get the same hype Bohemian Rhapsody got, but it still is a truly amazing film! 8.5/10",Rocketman

I do like films with music in though Bohemian Rapisody for instance is brilliant and I also love Rock Star.
This is a musical in the worst sense as far as I'm concerned and although I like the music of Elton John this is a bit like Mamma Mia I like the ABBA music but much like this the film format is a turn off as far as I'm concerned.
If you like musicals and the music of Elton John then you will enjoy it but for me it's a no and I ended up switching it off.",Rocketman
343,firti,I should not have high expectation,2,23 May 2019,It is not a movie it is more like a documentary where Elton John want to get even with his parents and his manager with a cheesy west end/broadway style.

The writers and arrangers brilliantly showcase EJ's pain and recovery through what can only be described as an extravaganza.I grew up with Elton John, with the rumors and stories, with the excess of his life, with the music, always the music. This movie honestly humanized him and showed me how saving his relationship with BT really was. I also loved the hope and transformation of EJ's sobriety and treatment. That was nice to see. I didn't have any interest in seeing the film when it first came out, but tonight, I'm so glad I watched it.Thanks for the film, Man.

With a beautiful wardrobe, excellent makeup and editing of the film, excellent choreographies and songs by Elton John. A fantastic musical that excites and at times I felt identified. Taron Egerton, great candidate for his first Oscar nomination, is fabulous, his best performance and is brilliant as Elton John; The rest of the cast is excellent.

Songs being sung before they were actually written and sung by other people. I almost always hate when other people try to sing someone else music, especially a kid.This movie just seemed like one big pity party for Elton. Apparently, everyone hated him when he was growing up, even his parents, and this led to drugs and stuff. This does not make for a good movie.",Rocketman
348,greggwager,The Elton (Soap) Opera,9,2 June 2019,"As this newest rock-music biopic commenced, I was confused and more than a bit worried. Elton John checks himself into rehab wearing a Mephistopheles costume. Using the protocol of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, he presents himself and a laundry list of addictions, then breaks into ""The Bitch is Back"" while seeing himself across the room at age five: ""I was justified when I was five...""What audacious license. Bernie Taupin wrote that lyric, so why does Elton assume he's the fellow in the song?Little by little, you get it: it's not license, because the songs are enough Elton's for him to recreate them any way he wants. He's retelling his life. Let him even cry it out (it's rehab, after all), although those songs, sad ones included, always uplifted in some way.Serving as an executive producer for this film, the Elton of today weepily retells his life, cramming songs into contexts never intended. So, the man born 72 years ago Reginald Kenneth Dwight now known as Sir Elton Hercules John compiles familiar tunes into opera, with plenty of soap opera thrown in too.What's all the crying about? Elton John has one of the most successful music careers ever. Unlike other famous biopics about rock musicians (The Buddy Holly Story, La Bamba, or last year's Bohemian Rhapsody), there is no tragic ending. He dodged airplane crashes, AIDS, drug overdoses, and even gunfire, unlike at least two of his close friends John Lennon and Gianni Versace.What a bitter prophesy his instrumental song ""Funeral for a Friend"" turned out to be. The untimely death of another close friend he famously performed at the funeral for, Lady Di, suggested at the time his own life might be a ""Candle in the Wind"" with tragedy just around the corner.But Elton John survives long enough to at least sort out his notorious temper tantrums and to confront demons that drove him, as the Mephistopheles costume suggests. Rocketman is not self-pity, it's the rock star finally getting it. Retelling his life is his valuable lesson, and he's finally sorry about mistakes and hurting certain people. Many times, ranting rock star even has the carpet pulled out from under him by people who have always genuinely loved him.But like opera, the events and characters are make-believe and distorted, even if borrowed from history. Elton's original publisher, Dick James (given over-the-top vulgarity by Stephen Graham) was supposedly not nearly the cigar-chomping imbecile portrayed in the story, but does aptly symbolize the ongoing ugliness of the recording industry. Elton's original producer, Ray Williams (played perceptively by Charlie Rowe), gets off the best zinger in the film when he tells the more mammon-guided John Reid (given cinematic sizzle as the film's ultimate villain by Richard Maddon) that his expensive artwork is hanging upside down.But the real hero of the tale blossoms in Bryce Dallas Howard's performance as Reggie's flighty mum, who doesn't break one ounce of poise in telling off her brat son. The lingering enigma of Reggie's otherwise stone-faced but pleasant father (with Steven Mackintosh superbly balancing this paradox) begs a pressing question: mum claimed she knew early on that Reggie was gay, but did dad also know, and was that the source of his emotionally abandoning his son and family?The film never allows Taron Egerton as Elton to answer these and other questions, which might have brought down the house, but we do get resolution in the end with photos of the real Elton of today showing off his new domestic life. Just the same, Egerton understands how his petty tantrums should keep the story going and unconventionally masters his lead part this way. Meanwhile, Jamie Bell musters his steady part as the cool friend and professional partner, Bernie, extremely likeable, even when going against the whims of anti-hero Elton.Otherwise flamboyant actor turned director, Dexter Fletcher, underplays the material as more a down-to-earth film, as does Lee Hall's serviceable screenplay. One can search the credits for a choreographer and find the name Adam Murray (under ""Other Crew""), but something should be mentioned about the often nerve-wracking way the story breaks back and forth between fantasy and reality parodying conventional musical. Just the same, we get to like the quirky storytelling process, which resolves itself in the end as something tongue-in-cheek, but also as something with the same ironic glitter of the era.Then we wonder if all our efforts in accepting the way this story was told were worth it. After all the story could have been told differently, although we often catch ourselves liking it the way it is.The main thing is that Elton may have done a lot of rightly regrettable things in his life, but what prevails is that he didn't burn out his fuse up there alone. Bravo then to this opera and anything else this still living rock star has to offer.",Rocketman

Elton John's Rocketman is another star in the sky that we often forget how far they are from the true reality of life as we believe it to be.Every person has a story to tell and maybe next time you feel like judging a person remember that you may not have really taken the time to listen to their tale.Let us all rejoice in the making of a star.A great film and biopic.,Rocketman
352,TheOvereducated,Unexpectedly great!,10,28 September 2019,"Really great film! I had so many emotions during the whole runtime. Initially I was very reluctant, because I had seen Taron Egerton only in some random clips of another film of his and I didn't find him good or even likeable. Well, after this film I changed've my view towards him. His acting was really good. And the film, great!
I'm glad my parents convinced me to go see it :)",Rocketman
353,devojonesy1977,Could've been better..MUCH better.,6,15 August 2019,"I have to agree with an earlier review. I think the emotional effectiveness was lost with the sub par ""musical numbers"" in the film. The real emotions would have carried better had they simply done lip syncing to the ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. Don't get me wrong Taron Egerton CAN carry a tune, he has a really great voice and does an AMAZING job playing Elton. But everyime that the movie burst into music, the impetus was lost with these bland reworkings of Elton and Taupins great music. As for the story? Wasn't the worst I've ever seen, it just seemed rushed at certain points and it tended to be a bit maudlin overall. I wouldn't say it was a bad film, I would say watch it..and whenever you feel a musical number kick in? Pause the film and put on the original song. It may go down as a better viewing experience that way",Rocketman
354,conway3000,Wow Movie,10,7 July 2019,"I saw Rocketman last night and was so impressed with the movie as well as the Oscar caliber performance of Taron Egerton as Elton. I live in the US and remember vividly when Elton burst into the scene in the US. I have attended 3 Elton John concerts. One in the beginning of his career with the fancy costumes, one with Billy Joel, and last fall Elton's farewell tour. All were inspiring and wonderful. I came away from Rocketman an entertaining well done film both raving about Egerton's superb performance and realizing and respecting anew Elton John's spectacular talent as a performer and songwriter with Bernie Taupin's talent as a lyricist. I hope both the film and Egerton get recognized at Oscar time.",Rocketman
355,mossow92,"Good, but felt a little rushed.",7,6 July 2019,"Not really sure where I sit with this one. A gripping tale of one of music's biggest icons. While Egerton shines as the glorious John, all the surrounding characters seemed to be simple generic caricatures of staples from this kind of stories. And the story blazes by, many of the acts with little explanation of motives. It follows the basic by the numbers of the musical biopic, never really seeming to let the weight of one single action hit with the viewer before moving onto the next tragic act. While the characters and story seemed to ring a bit formulaic and hollow, Egerton's performance is able to carry the gravitas. And the music, oh the music. John's catalog is beautifully strewn throughout the film in all its glory, though Taron's vocals struggle in parts and he is outsung by his supporting cast at points. And in the end, the conclusion and resolution come, yet once again seemingly easily and out of nowhere as had the conflict earlier in the film. A great story of a great artist that just seemed to miss on a few points for me. Did I enjoy the movie? Yes. It just seemed like a cliff notes version of what could have been a deeper and more compelling story.",Rocketman

360,tomfeller,musical biography of superstar,8,7 August 2019,"Way back in 1998, my wife and I saw Elton John with about 18,000 other fans. We had the ""cheap"" $50 seats on the side of the stage. He stayed at his baby grand piano during the entire two hour concert, so his back was turned to us, but we were only about 30 meters away from. To see his face, we had to watch the giant TV monitors. He wore a pink suit, which was quite restrained for him as opposed the costumes shown in the new movie, but the pants split and he had to change clothes. He was sober by this time and drank at least three Diet Cokes during his performance.
This film is a musical biography showing his life as a child up to the time when he went into rehab and gave up all his addictions (drugs, alcohol, sex, etc.) except for shopping. The group therapy sessions in rehab provide a framing story. Taron Edgerton is excellent as the star, and he even did his own singing. John's real name was Reginald Dwight (played as a boy by Matthew Illesley and as an adolescent by Kit Conner), but neither of his two parents (Bryce Dallas Howard, Steve Mackintosh) shows him or each other any love or affection, although he may have inherited his love of music from his father. Fortunately, he had Ivy, a nurturing grandmother played by Gemma Jones. John was a piano prodigy who attended the Royal Academy of Music. His career took off when he was still a teenager after his record label paired him with Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) to write lyrics which John put to music. Their friendship forms the emotional core of the movie, although Bernie tells John early on that he is straight. After they become successful, John Reid (Richard Madden, who played Robb Stark in Game of Thrones coincidentally) becomes John's personal manager and lover. Unfortunately, this relationship and John's addictions led John and Taupin to becoming estranged for a time. The music is excellent, of course, although some of the numbers have different arrangements than what we are used to hearing and are presented in a different chronological order that they really occurred. Although John, now 72 years old and sober for the past 28, and his husband are executive producers, this is a ""warts and all"" story. I don't know how accurate the details are, although some reviewers have pointed out discrepancies with the historical record. The scenes in which characters burst into song and dance were obviously fantasies but entertaining ones.",Rocketman

I loved every minute of the reverie. All of the actors do top-quality work (god I love Jamie Bell -- catch him in Nicholas Nickleby sometime) so you feel the episodes onscreen as opposed to just observing them.If you've never heard of Elton John or if you hate musicals where people burst into song, stay home.

363,toadwriter,"Like Elton John, not the movie",3,29 March 2020,"Let me start by saying that a movie about Elton John should be larger than life, because he is larger than life. I hope in 50 years, when all them eager artists are watching movies about musicians that there will be a better film about Elton John. Rocketman makes his life out to be some tragedy - a tragedy we've seen played out a thousand times before.I think the writing is lousy.The credits mention that Elton's been sober 28 years, but nothing of the better years of his life is depicted in this film. If that's a spoiler, I'm sorry, but I really feel I'm doing you a favor when I tell you not to bother watching this film.Other than Elton himself, the characters are written poorly. There's no real explanation of why the relationship with his mother goes south, and while his relationship with his father was broken, the film doesn't depict what they did that was so wrong for Elton to take to a life of drugs and alcohol. When Elton was crying, I felt nothing. Nothing in this film shocked or saddened me.I'd say the biggest tragedy is that this film could have been a real learning experience, but people that don't know anything about Elton shouldn't watch this film. I find it hard to believe that Elton would want a movie that just shows how broken he was, because the best years of his life were after all the turmoil that this film focuses on. I find that to be the biggest tragedy here... that he'd want to be remembered as a broken child. I want people to know that Elton is iconic and this film does a terrible job representing him in that regard.In comparison, Bohemian Rhapsody made Queen out to be the best rock band ever and I lived their era. They weren't the best band ever. Zeppelin, Floyd, Doors, Beatles, and so many more were definitely regarded as better than Queen. But the movie will convince you that Queen is the best rock band ever. That movie is so OUTSTANDING. Rocketman made Elton lower than life and he should be remembered as Queen was in Bohemian Rhapsody. Maybe Elton and fans feel the story - depicted in Rocketman - needed to be told, but seriously, let's make a movie about Elton that portrays him as the icon he is.The worst critique I can give this film is that I won't watch it again. On the other hand, I have already seen Bohemian Rhapsody a dozen times and I'll watch it every time it's on tv. I own the DVD.",Rocketman

There was an annoying theme of switching between real and fantasy and it made him appear schizophrenic. This was a pretty big letdown.

Just because someone sings and wears costumes it doesn't make them a good actor. First of all, he has ZERO charisma, an expressionless face, and is only an average singer with a lackluster voice. He seems NOTHING like Elton John, not his voice, his looks, mannerisms, literally nothing. At first I thought maybe I just need to adjust to him playing Elton John but no the movie went off and I still never felt like I was watching Elton John. I could have maybe accepted that if there was some good acting but this guy is one of the most bland actors I've ever seen. But the scenes where he's supposed to be angry are truly cringe worthy. I see he is on a British television show so I can only assume he has fans that think he's good simply because he's their favorite TV show star or something. Okay, enough about the horribly miscast actor who is getting accolades for simply playing Elton John poorly. Don't. Get. It.The film....dear God, one of the worst and most annoying movies I have ever seen. The way it's edited is so ""trying too hard"" and it's so over edited that it's distracting. No shot seems to last more than one second during conversations it's just back and forth and back and forth constantly. I mean leave the camera on someone for a couple of seconds, jeez! The score is bland and TV movie style, the supporting actors are annoying and mostly have an amateur feel. You feel like you're watching a cheesy made for TV movie or a bad play. It's emotionless and totally unbelievable.This is truly one of the worst put together, worst acted films I have seen all year, maybe ever, and there isn't a single part that I can say I enjoyed. And I love Elton John's music. But you won't even get that here. This Taron Egerton does all the singing instead of lip syncing which is a huge mistake. He has a bland vocal style, like a commercial jingle singer or something, no charisma at all, no range, lackluster and boring. It would have been better if he had lip synced because at least something about the film would have been enjoyable. Just putting on glasses and costumes does not make someone Elton John. They needed a more charismatic actor or someone who looked like him or could sing like him...something! Even the little kid who plays young Elton is terrible. I can't get over how bad this film is.How did Taron Egerton win a Golden Globe? So many much better performances this year. Stop rewarding people for simply showing up and singing. Thank goodness The Academy has better sense than to nominate him for an Oscar. Horrible, horrible film.",Rocketman
368,Love_Life_Laughter,Rare look behind the celebrity mask (contains spoilers),10,11 May 2020,"Elton John has given us his audience the gift of sharing his emotional reality. It doesn't really matter if you are a multi-millionaire sitting in an exclusive restaurant when your mother states what a burden it has been being your mother. There are some sources of human pain that transcend fame and fortune. For every Elton John, there are many children who don't have that incredible musical talent to save them, at least financially. What Elton John does here is provide all of us a road map for recovery, through our own mind and our own pain, a validation of doing the work through psychotherapy to reach the other side and stop self-destruction based upon internalized early childhood rejection and pain. It would have been so easy to stay behind the mask. This movie makes me want to meet Elton in a pub for a beer. What an incredible service and labor of love. That it comes with his fabulous music and great dancing is the cherry on the icing. That this film, produced by his proud husband, is the ultimate love letter that any spouse could receive - the story of how Elton became his own hero - make this a particularly satisfying sundae.

Taron Egerton is - and continues to be - excellent, but this is an ensemble piece - without the superb performance from Jamie Bell, the unexpectedly skilled presentation of a truly unlikeable character by Richard Madden and the inspired choice of both Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor as the younger Reg Dwights this film could not have worked. It has a masterful weaving of fact with fantasy and - as you might expect from a film about Elton John - there are a number of hugely enjoyable musical set pieces. It is no surprise that a film about the music of someone who appears in most music collections is such fun to watch. Very enjoyable. For some odd reason several people compare this film with Bohemian Rhapsody, but that would be unhelpful. This is a musical about the rise to fame of Reggie Dwight as he became Elton John. It has musical pieces interspersed with the story and works very well. Bohemian Rhapsody is a better crafted film (I was absolutely blown away by Bohemian Rhapsody when I saw it at the cinema), and it deserved the Oscars it received but (sshhh - little secret) I actually find watching Rocketman more enjoyable, somehow!",Rocketman

Jaime Bell and Richard Madden were also great. This truly is a musical fantasy, it was stylish and different which I loved. The directing wasn't anything special, although there were some long takes that I appreciated. The structure was a little flimsy, it was a little too long, the pacing was a little boring and repetitive in some areas, but not overall. It also follows your typical biopic formula, but it's pretty unique on its own, so overall that overshadows it's familiar formula.

371,mbruce007,Hello Yellow-Brick Road......A Cinematic Gem!,8,10 September 2019,"Before seeing Dexter Fletcher's brilliant biopic, Rocketman, I thought that Elton John's life was glitz, glamour, and, of course, unfortunate hair.... As it turns out, I was only half right. To my great surprise, what I thought would be a Mamma Mia-esque romp through John's songbook turned out to be an unflinching exposé of the largely difficult life that John has led - a man who welcomed fame with open arms, but who has also paid the price for it many times. If there was any doubt before, Rocketman confirms that John's on-screen avatar, Taron Egerton, of Kingsman fame, is a star. He shows both the intense vulnerability of Elton John the man, and the bravura of Elton-John, the bedecked on-stage megastar.The film begins with Egerton as John, sitting among comparably average members of a support group, sometime in the 1980s, as he recounts his life thus far and confronts the problems which have almost derailed his career, many of which hark back to difficult relationships in childhood and early adulthood. Without spoiling too much, there is an emotional, cathartic moment towards the end of the film where John confronts a series of apparitions in turn, an experience through which he is able to find some sort of closure and which enables him to confirm that ""I'm Still Standing"".It is evident, therefore, that this film is not for the faint-hearted. It does not shy away from portraying drug-use, sex, and, instances of mental and physical abuse. But, as Elton John himself recently said after censors threatened to cut certain scenes, ""I have not led a PG-13 life"". This film could not be more timely in its exploration of one man's personal problems in an age in which we are belatedly breaking the taboos surrounding mental health. How humbling for John to show us that even megastars are fallible human beings. Considering this, I found the closing intertitles about John's life now, detailing his charity work and family life, overly sentimental. However, that is a small criticism in an otherwise fine piece of cinema.Egerton's co-stars are all brilliant, notably Jamie Bell who plays John's long-suffering musical collaborator, Bernie Taupin. Finally, checking out the film's soundtrack release is also a must - Egerton singing as Elton John is wonderfully uncanny.",Rocketman

I'd seen Taron Egerton is a few movies from the past and thought he was charming, but I wasn't sure how he'd be in this film....did he PERFORM! We'll get more into that later, but it had to be said! Many people are comparing this to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that came out last year for obvious reasons. Both are about famous musicians rise to stardom, while also claiming to give us entertainment and behind the scenes looks into their lives. Yes I'm aware that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was said to be about Queen and not just Freddie Mercury, but let's be real here. They marketed it as a Freddie movie, he's the only one on the theatrical poster and the focus points of the trailers.That being said ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was okay. It was enjoyable enough due to Rami Malek's performance, but it missed the point of what a biopic is supposed to be about. Raw emotion, ups as well as downs and not just a glamorized music video. Yes ""Rocketman"" has music throughout it, but it keeps the story going on in the most beautifully done way. It has its borderline ""cheesy moments"", but we see a lot of heart shattering stuff in this film. Parts had me wanting to reach into the screen, shake Taron Egerton's Elton John and say ""You're amazing just the way you are and you're better than this!"" We see drugs, alcohol, sex, family issues, suicidal thoughts, fake personas, and more. It's a crazy emotional ride and with Taron giving such a stellar performance it feels real. Way more real than ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ever felt and in this people literally levitate off the floor at one part! Yes there is a sense of surrealism in this including that scene, rocketing off of a stage, long sequences like the shopping scene and the sex addiction scene. But it worked.I want to give the costume designers in this some love because they knocked it out of the park. Elton John is of course known for his flashy, flamboyant fashion choices, this was definitely given to us on a silver platter. When we see scenes of Elton on stage in his various outfits while ""Pinball Wizard"" plays, its both haunting and something really special. There's a few moments in this film that shocked me with their intensity. The pool scene with ""Rocket Man"" was spectacular, I got literal goosebumps from how powerful it was. The creation of ""Your Song"" was also very moving, the scene in the phone booth, ugh there are so many moments that stuck in my head!This is a musical movie, so it moves the plot along with some of Elton's most famous songs. If you hate musicals, you may still like this movie! But be prepared to watch emotion unfold with song on occasions. The fact that Taron Egerton sang this entire soundtrack is so impressive to me, most actors would lip-sync to actual songs from the artist, but not Taron. Speaking of Taron, let's get into this. If you for some reason do not like this movie (no idea how!) you have to at least appreciate the genius that was Taron Egerton in this film. He reached into a deep part of himself and gave the performance of his career at 29 years old. His emotion in this was so painfully in his facial features I thought at times that he really was a young Elton John. I felt his heartbreak, addictive tendencies, anger, frustration, happiness. It was all there so flawlessly! This may be the best biopic related performance I've ever seen, not joking.Yes, we all know Taron was incredible in this and if he doesn't get an Oscar nomination at least we riot, but what about the rest of the cast? They were also clearly bringing their A game here. I wanted to strangle Richard Madden's character on multiple occasions, ugh! Jamie Bell brought a warmth to his character that radiated off the screen. What a great casting choice on all ends. Honestly, I haven't had a movie fly by so fast and me being saddened that it was over in a long time.Finally, because it's such a topic of discussion right now I want to talk about the LGBTQ aspects of this film. First of all, it's a story about Elton John...what the hell were you expecting? Yes there's men kissing in it on multiple occasions, yes there's a sex scene. It's done between two men whom at the time loved each other and it's honestly just a really intimate loving scene. If anyone has a problem with that, don't see this movie and stay away from my vicinity! If I can see this in a packed theatre with 90% of it being older people and they don't even bat an eye, you have no excuse.Please see this movie, it deserves all the love it can get! It does Elton John justice and showcases an incredible performance by Taron Egerton as well as the rest of the cast.

374,branflakes4547,Refreshing,8,19 June 2019,"This movie kind of surprised me. It was very unique by Hollywood's standards. I honestly did not know it was a musical numbers. There are many wonderful and memorable musical moments. I could have done without all the gay kissing, even though I fully appreciate the fact that Elton is gay and I am not homophobic",Rocketman
375,Tushpi,Misses the mark,6,5 October 2019,"First up I'm a big fan of Elton John. He is a truely creative hugely talented composer, singer and entertainer. I have utmost respect for him. I was looking forward to getting to know more about how he became who he now is. The film in my view lacked authenticity. The story flipped flopped from one character to another without revealing any glimpse of the true character or motivations of the key people in his life. Why did his father and mother act as they did. Never explained. Everyone is two dimensional. Simplistic.Wooden. No depth. It inferred that Elton was in great emotional pain for a large part of his life but it wasn't clear why. As a result he came across as petulant and indulgent.
The story arc is confusing with glaring inaccuracies which is annoying when the movie is supposedly describing the life of someone so public.
It has of course gorgeous costumes and lots of big musical numbers. It is in essence a musical. As a musical it had the most potential, but Elton has a unique voice. Taron Egerton does a great job being Elton, really captures his look, but how could he be expected to reproduce the greatness that is Elton's performance. The film may have worked if we could have been swept along by Elton singing. What's wrong with miming. How uplifting that would have been. Instead we are treated to a karaoke. The movie falls flat and I grew bored. Disappointing.",Rocketman
376,Sees All,Dazzling presentation of a cliche,7,1 June 2019,"In the past decade or two Broadway has been inundated with ""jukebox musicals,"" a genre that uses existing pop songs instead of a new score and shoehorns them into a story. After MAMA MIA was so successful using ABBA music, there has been an avalanche of musicals using the songs of, say, The Beach Boys, Earth, Wind, and Fire; The Go-Gos, The Motown catalog, Carole King, Peter Allen, Donna Summer, Cher, etc., ad infinitum. They usually don't work because pop songs are not theatrical. However, with ROCKETMAN, the jukebox musical comes into its own on film. We've gotten used to experiencing pop songs as background music while a montage of scenes is flashed on the screen (z.B., BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID) and the MTV music video has become a new art form. ROCKETMAN tells the story of Elton John's life (he is the executive producer, too) using songs he either wrote or performed to further that story. At key emotional moments, the actors burst into song and that songs turns into a very cinematic production number. A lot of this is brilliant and exhilarating. But alas, the story is all too familiar: unhappy child grows up to become a successful entertainer and cracks up, but thanks to the love of a significant other, they pull through it and live happily ever after. The only surprises are in the WAY the story is told. The gay love story is done pretty much the way heterosexual love stories are done, including the nude bedroom scene. No genitals are flashed, but it does present two naked men enjoying each other's body. I haven't been to that many movies in recent years, but that's the first time I've seen that in a mainstream movie. But the basic story is pretty hackneyed these days. Production values are top notch, with lots of stunning visuals, and the cast is excellent. I especially liked Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin. Basically I enjoyed it, but it's not the masterpiece I was hoping for.",Rocketman
377,oscardomingueziiiod,For the fans,10,8 June 2019,When I saw this musical documentary movie for Elton John. I can't think another word and how to describe it. When I saw it oh man blown away I was felling excited so much that my head exploded. One of the things about this I'll say his personal unique looks and styal wardrobe and funky glasses . To conclude long live rock and roll,Rocketman
378,chrislgorman,Good performance by Eggerton ...missed opportunity,5,14 June 2019,"I was generally looking forward to this film, but I walked out bored and disappointed.
The creative team of Elton John and Bernie Taupin created iconic music that was a snapshot of the times. The storytelling style of Elton sitting around a rehab table was sad, boring and overdone. Come on already, with the talking into the camera and smiling?
Could have been so much better.",Rocketman
379,bliss66,Fails to launch,3,27 May 2019,"People must have very low expectations if they thought this was good. Mine were set at ""Bohemian Rhapsody low,"" a standard it still failed to meet. There's nothing moving about this; they really F up the music by trying to create a book musical about Elton's early life with all of the actors singing it - probably the only pleasure of BoRhap was hearing Queen's originals on a good sound system. You'll get none of that here. It's all re-arranged, truncated, poorly sung. You have to tolerate the poor singing even though there's nothing realistic about the script, no dramatic scenes of note, just images and montages, the actors are just stand-ins for characters we never get to know much about (Gemma Jones, of course, being the best of them). For some reason, Bryce Dallas Howard is innit trying to talk like Adele - surely they could've gotten any number of British actresses to play/stand-in as Elton's mother?! It's a bit like watching a stage show on film. But the script hasn't a clue what's going on in the middle - and you won't either - with its muddled timeline (erm, Elton John was a huge star when he duetted with Kiki Dee - he hooks up with Richard Madden's John Reid after the Troubadour gig in August 1970 and we're meant to believe they don't see each other again until the recording of Don't Go Breaking My Heart in March 1976 but still somehow carry a white hot flame for each other? Whatever). The absence of anything from or even about Captain Fantastic is a disappointment. But this rubbish is what passes for a 5-star film these days. There's a lot of whinging about how hard it is/was to be Elton John but in the hands of Fletcher, Hall and Egerton, no actual pain or anything to empathise with. There are moments when it looks a bit like Ken Russell's Tommy - the worst bits. Hall's rendering and Egerton's performance are both just one note: ""poor me, I'm Elton John."" For the most part, Egerton looks like a children's party entertainer. Nothing like the original, for those who remember the times. It ends very anti-climatically with Egerton CGI-d into the original video for I'm Still Standing which was more of a curio at the time, rather than a career high; and a slideshow of Elton's public and personal accomplishments since then, done as the type of thing you'd expect at a surprise party rather than a major motion picture. If it makes $900M I'll be surprised. Again.",Rocketman
380,MrLucasWarHero,"Ultimately a Fun Watch, But It Didn't Blow Me Away",7,8 August 2019,"Propelled by a fun and creative way to tell the artist's story through his own music, although I felt that the film fell flat during certain emotional scenes and Taron Egerton's acting seemed to be a bit forced at certain moments.",Rocketman
381,MariaLBD,Pity party with great acting,5,19 April 2020,"The overall impression I got was that we're supposed to feel sorry for Elton John and understand that his early years entitle him to be a diva. Another takeaway is that Bernie Taupin deserves sainthood for putting up with him and still being a true friend despite all the B.S.I thought the acting was fantastic. Taron Egerton and Jamie Bell were superb. The movie itself (aside from it being biographical) was pretty good but I hated the fantasy musical numbers. Actually, I fast-forwarded through them because they were so painfully cheesy and added nothing to the story. It seemed as though they were perhaps required to squeeze in certain songs and didn't know how else to fit them in.I think I would've enjoyed the movie more if I never heard of Elton John, they skipped the therapy session parts and fantasy sequences, and just told the story linearly rather than as flashbacks.Got 2 hours to kill? Watch it. But keep your remote close with your finger on the FF button.",Rocketman
382,deborah-99172,Brilliant performance & a great movie musical experience,10,30 December 2019,"I am absolutely mystified by the bad reviews of this movie in this thread. Taron Egerton is brilliant as Elton John, the script is cleverly crafted, and the way song is used to tell a story is excellent.There's a bit of magical realism, with the people that live in one's head appearing before one's eyes. Time turns in on itself, dream is reality is dream, but the sureness of the director's vision makes all malleability of time completely believable as a movie experience and story-telling device.There is cruelty, which is fortunately overcome. The movie captures the look of the 1950s to 1980s really well. The costumes are, of course, fabulous!The supporting actors are all strong foils for Mr. Egerton. The music is great, and Taron sings his own songs and is wildly better as a singing/dancing/creative person than most every other movie about singers that is out there.I am astonished that Rami Malek won the Academy Award the year his movie came out. That was some heavy duty hustling on Malek's part. Taron's performance is by far the more complex, the more layered, nuanced, emotional.",Rocketman

386,krational,A soul sealed by a hideous appearance,7,1 June 2020,"In an age of justice or justice, obesity and ugliness have almost become the harshest sentence for a person. As human beings, we cannot actually ignore the flesh and reach the soul directly. Sometimes, the beautiful soul is trapped in a flesh that can't bear to look directly, which leads to an indescribable tragedy.
This movie describes this deep sorrow and loneliness. Fuchs was an ugly fat man who worked as a baggage porter in the ground handling department of the airport. He was of no age, never had a girlfriend, and still lived with his mother. The few hobbies are playing with sand table models and listening to heavy metal music in World War II . He has few friends, and one or two people who keep socializing are connected by these quirky hobbies. He was kind, timid, and dared not to meet with people's eyes. He always lowered his head when speaking with people. Therefore, he was teased and mocked by his co-workers and questioned whether he was a virgin. In a depressed life, he encountered an unpredictable love. A woman with depression came together with him. He thought that he and the other party could save each other, but in the end he found that things did not get their wish.
As an Icelandic film, all its details naturally permeate the unique chilliness and alienation temperament of Northern Europe. The cold mood and this lonely story mutually support each other. The opening scene very beautifully laid the director's ambitions. Under the overhead shot, on the empty airport runway, the baggage-carrying vehicle passed slowly around, silently, and the light sprinkled on the ground. Refining emotions from the common scenes of daily life is a unique skill, which is very refined in many Nordic movies. For this movie, all the scenes are reflections of the character's psychological map.
Foss bought himself a remote-controlled car, which was controlled by the wind on the open space downstairs, and he controlled it alone. For him, real life was something he could not shake and control, what he could control, and what he liked , Are childish things that are childish or adolescent. For example, the sand table of World War II, such as this toy car, such as the tacit understanding of the song between him and the midnight radio DJ, he was arranging the soldiers, remotely controlling the car, he heard a favorite from the radio Yes, a song that can vent your emotions, this is all the fun of his life, everything is related to ""things"", things will not hurt him, but people may be more terrible. He re-arranged the formations for the battle of World War II, but he had no way to deal with his real life.
Fuchs himself was an isolated symbol, and everyone regarded him as a monster. His kindness can only be understood by the neighbor 's children, he accompanied the lonely little girl, but was suspected by her father to be a pedophile, and the love he met was initially at a loss, and later regarded him as a life-saving straw. The flip was very interesting this time. At first, it was the woman who led him, a little bit to make him understand how a relationship is in love and how to get along. Soon, he discovered the problem of the other party. When the woman fell into depression When he extricated himself, Foss became a teacher. He cooked breakfast for her, went to work for her, and helped her out of the haze. The two ""patients"" accidentally became each other's doctors.
The relationship experienced twists and turns. They had been intimate and alienated. Later, the woman felt that the fat man was worthy of trust and asked him to move in with him, but in the end, he changed his mind. However, even so, she still saved the man, let him finally take the first step in independent life, let him understand how much warmth and change in the real world human relationship, as an adult must face For all this. The emotional ups and downs between them is actually the change of emotional cues of normal men and women, but it is placed on two different bodies, so that everything seems to have a diffuse grief. But this grief eventually dissipated, giving Foss insight into the real world.
The second half of the film shows a subtle change. After Fowth had a girlfriend, everything was changing. He went to the garbage station for the woman, and his colleagues there were far more kind than those who made fun of him Many, they invited him to go to the bar to drink and watch the ball, like treating an ordinary buddy. His girlfriend was like a fulcrum, prying him out of the life he had fallen into, and let him see that although the world is full of holes, it is also worth diving into it for one experience.
Eventually, he burst out smiling on the plane flying abroad. That was the smile that Foss couldn't see in the movie, and he changed the past dullness. He walked out of the original family, out of the closed heart, and the smile was almost an expression of the most healing department.",Rocketman
387,taranpannu01,Rocketman (2019),8,15 June 2019,"Rocketman is a strongly directed, performed and put together cinematic experience about the life of Elton John.Taron Egerton excels as the titular Rocketman with a poignant, soft but still all guns blazing performance. His singing is wonderful and he jumps head first into the role and gives a brilliantly tender soul to the film.Egerton is only as good as his support and my god his support is good. Jamie Bell as Bernie gives for some of the film's most poignant scenes.Bryce Dallas Howard is an inspired casting choice to play Elton's mother and she gives it her best (although it was very clear she didn't do her own singing!)Stephen Graham is just fantastic as usual. Charlie Rowe and Tate Donovan do very well with their limited parts.
Steven Mackintosh and Gemma Jones were great reliable support whilst Richard Madden was brilliant fiendish as John Reid (who was also played by Game of Thrones alumni Aiden Gillen in Bo Rhap and one wonders where he could've taken the role if it was as fleshed out as Madden's).Little Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor were fantastic as little Elton and they deserve as much praise as Taron.The film is so well put together, the way the film is constructed with this circular narrative puts Bo Rhaps' circular structure to shame and although one shouldn't compare, the comparison between these films is hard to avoid, because Rocketman is so bloody brilliant.The set pieces / transitions between scenes are just wonderful, director Dexter Fletcher deserves all the praise for how he has constructed this film. He directed the bloody hell out of this film and deserves all the accolades coming his way.Never been a massive Elton John fan, didn't grow up on his music and that is exactly why I wanted to see this film, everybody I know loved Bohemian Rhapsody for the ""nostalgia"" but nostalgia shouldn't overshadow poor storytelling and construction.Rocketman proves you don't need to rely on nostalgia to make a bloody great film.",Rocketman
388,firstruleofmethclub,Truth/fantasy mis-mesh,6,11 September 2019,"Rocketman tries to walk a line between the paint-by-numbers musician biopic bog standard, and epic musical fantasy. A lot of the time when a movie tries to be a blend of two things, it ends up being neither. Rocketman, conversely, ends up being both, just never at the same time. It's basically two movies, and that epic musical fantasy movie I was talking about that's in there, that's a great movie. Unfortunately, the other one, is not so much. I'm still gonna come away giving it a recommendation, because there is enough in there to mean that I enjoyed it, especially in the core casting, all of which is great, not least Egerton. But I was little disappointed, not because my expectations were too high going in or anything, but because every time Rocketman began to slip into a euphoric high, it was moments later wrenched back to, well... Reality, I guess. Albeit a reality we only see on a movie screen. And we see on every movie screen when it's a musician biopic. I mean, this is Elton John we're talking about, if there was ever a moment to reject the mundane and fully embrace the over-the-top flamboyant fantasy it was here. But Rocketman just kind of Awkward Christian Camp Side Hugs the over-the-top flamboyant fantasy.Final rating: 6/10 - I liked it. Would personally recommend you give it a go.",Rocketman

Scene where he is singing with Kiki Dee is 1976 and next we go back to 1975 . And no it was no flashback . And when they sing Goodbye yellow brick road the timeline is again wrong. Other mistakes : Rocketman was not played at the troubadour , he did not change his name to John because of Lennon , Bernie did not write Border song ,he married only in 1984 , and there are other errors.Bottom line , so many mistakes that it can not compete in any way with f.i.

393,ross-547-585754,Not what I expected,9,26 May 2019,"Don't think you're going to see another Bohemian Rhapsody. This is a raw portrayal of a 'warts and all' Elton John. The sound track covers much of his extensive repertoire, but instead of being faithful 'copies' of the originals they are sung to further the narrative, giving a deeper understanding to the lyrics.
Taron Egerton does an amazing job, but don't expect his singing to be a dutiful copy of Elton John. Like Les Miserables, the songs are 'acted out' and are often brilliantly choreographed.
The movie covers Elton from his boyhood as 'Reginald Dwight' to his heady days as an out of control rock star. The film leans heavily on his family, relationships and his hedonistic days prior to the breakdown of his career. The final scenes are wonderful and the final performance fitting.

394,neilwaynesmith,How come Sir Elton hasn't adopted Taron Egerton?,10,29 December 2019,"Egerton absolutely nails Sir Elton, looks, mannerisms, attitude. It is a stupendous performance. The film isn't your 'conventional' biopic à la 'Bohemian Rhapsody', being very much a traditional musical in the true sense of the word.
The music is cleverly used to link aspects of Sir Eltons life & also to skip years to the next key moment. Egerton gives an incredible performance with Sir Eltons songs as well as the background to their creation. Due credit is given to Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), the wordsmith behind & alongside Sir Elton.
It says a lot that the film doesn't appear to pull many punches; Sir Elton is fundamentally unlikeable throughout the majority of the 'adult' part of the film & the interspersed 'rehab' scenes serve to highlight and reinforce this, as Sir Elton, initially in flamboyant 'devil suit' gradually sheds his persona through changes in wardrobe reflecting his facing, accepting and overcoming his demons to emerge, renewed, on the other side.
The merging of Egerton into the 'I'm still standing' video is 99% successful from a technical aspect, but emotionally it perfectly rounds out the film. The credits and text fill in the blanks bringing us upto date and the photo comparisons between Egerton & Sir Elton in various costumes are worth viewing.

The British pop star, who is almost done with his musical career, is still alive and certainly had a lot of involvement in the film. Since I really liked Elton John and especially his music, but didn't know much about his life, I really wanted to see ""Rocketman""... and not just because I also really appreciate and like the leading actor Taron Egerton!Elton John joins a support group and tells his story when he wasn't called Elton but Reginald Dwight. He describes his highs and lows and his rise as a world star!""Rocketman"" surprised me positively in many ways, such as the musical flair that I hadn't expected. But all the song numbers have all become very great, some even stunningly beautiful and graceful! Exciting dance choreos and great singers, Egerton in particular convinces with his beautiful voice. But above all, I like the somewhat ""relaxed"" moments!Between the gaudy, colorful songs there is always room for honest and beautiful moments. On top of that the movie can be funny at times. Of course, this is also due to the charming actors. Taron Egerton is the star and his non-existent Oscar nomination is disappointing. I think it's great that he has grown from a young action star (""Kingsmen"") to a seasoned character actor who can´t just dance, but also sing! There´re also the small details with which he brings Elton to life that touched me. Jamie Bell is also good, Richard Madden is doing well and Bryce Dallas Howard surprised me probably the most with her role.
Nevertheless, I found the film a bit too long and some scenes were stretched out too much, especially in the second half. Other moments, however, were too rushed for me, as if one wanted to end the film somehow. I also felt the apparently inevitable ""Hollywood-Kitsch"" the whole runtime. Sadly Dexter Fletcher was unable to resist some clichés ...But ""Rocketman"" can still convince in my opinion and is extremely entertaining until the end. Not just because of the great music: Matthew Margeson composed the score and arranged some great numbers. Well-known Elton John classics feel fresh and new. ""Rocket Man"", ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""I'm Still Standing"" knocked me out of the park and ""Your Song"" moved me to tears as so often.Visually, the film convinces with some spectacular pictures and tracking shots, especially in the musical scenes. Some CGI effects were a bit too artificial for that, but whatever, I can forgive that for a film like this ...Conclusion: ""Rocketman"" is certainly not just a very entertaining work for Elton John fans. Of course, not everything in Elton's story will be accurate, but you can do that in a film like this, if the end result works on an emotional level and is able to entertain. And ""Rocketman"" entertains, even if it is a little uneven here and there.",Rocketman

Fortunately, come Academy Award time, these promotional gimmicks have no bearing. The movie trailer does not accurately show this film as the musical it really is, so many may be turned off by this alone. Mr. Egerton sings the songs himself, though Elton vocal range is nothing compared to Freddie Mercury, so Taron's ability to sing is commendable but not extraordinarily difficult compared to MANY actors and actress who have done the same you would never have known they sing at all, whether they use LaDiDa app, or vocal harmonizers, the final sound in a film is anything but live. This film in no way should be compared to last year's most favored film, but after a few months the distinction
shall be realized. Worth a watch? If you like the glamorization of Reginald Dwight, and pass over the real man who despises his ""fans"" and ironically , the media; which has fallen all over itself to get favorable initial reviews to keep an interest in this film as Summer Blockbusters, Godzilla, etc and the winter (& final) ""Star Wars"" blasts off to try & catch ""Avengers: Endgame"" this film needs all the promotion it can get. Will you walk away ""getting"" Reginald Dwight? of course not, but you will of the persona called Elton John. Sidenote: the portrayal of Elton's first manager was misrepresented completely, further illustrating this films sensationalism rather than a true to life musical, NOT a BioPic. Opening weekend results just in & Rocketman sputters at #3 with $25 million, half of the King of the Monsters & box office, Godzilla.",Rocketman
403,reagansteyn,"If I hear ""Bohemian Rhapsody was better"" one more time!....",9,25 January 2020,"I'm reading these reviews having a little chuckle to myself... people are mad that it was more of a musical than a bio; comparing it to Bohemian Rhapsody or just hating on it because it's about Elton. Why that's a problem, I have no idea. You're going to watch a film based on Eltons life and music... like, what are you expecting? A horror/thriller?... Here's an unbiased opinion for those of you who haven't seen it. Yes, it's more of a musical but it still tells Eltons story in what I think is actually a really creative idea. I won't spoil that for you though. Whether you love him or not, it really opens your eyes to just how fame and fortune isn't all it's cracked up to be. It has absolutely no comparison to Bohemian!! It's a totally different director anyway.",Rocketman
404,ReviewingHistory,"A Kaleidospic View into the Crises, Opportunities, Tensions and Redemptions in Elton John's life, and on his Music",7,5 July 2020,"Rocketman offers a peak into the early life, adolescence, and years musical ascension of legendary Sir Elton John. It features Elton John's nuclear family environment, his calling and talent for music, and his longing for love above all.The film offers a naked view of his struggles at home, with his search for his relational and professional identities, and for his sheer talent and stage presence. Featuring. also, his famous songs in the context of his life stages and experiences, the musicality of the film comes through, at times on-point, at times not so much.And yet, all in all, the film ""works"" in its own way: it lends you a kaleidoscopic view into the crises, opportunities, healings and reparations through which Sir John passed and survived. TAt the end, the viewer will thus be well-informed of the artist's life story, and of some of his hit songs too, while left impressed with the excellent acting by the lead actor.The only points of improvement, to my view on the film, would be on providing for a more immersive experience into how it felt like to be in one of his concerts, through photography, audience views, and the like, and on the landscape and photography of the settings featured (e.g., London, LA, Australia, among other places). But still, Rocketman views as a pleasant film, worth watching for the sake of discovery of this man's heart, pains, and achievements.",Rocketman
405,keithsealy,"Formulaic, better suited for a stage play than a movie",5,3 June 2019,"We have see all this before. Rockstar suffers difficulties in his/her youth. They have detractors (usually parents) and supporters who help them through. They find huge success. They become lost in the drugs and ego, pushing away those who love them and relying instead on enablers and those who only want to profit. They realize their mistake, have a 'come to Jesus' moment, and they learn to be happy with who they are.There is nothing new here.Further, the stage musical nature of this movie means you never quite feel part of the story or get too emotionally involved. The final climactic scene (which felt even more like a stage play moment) falls flat. To top it off, they end with remake of an 80s era MTV video that is just cringeworthy.The performances were solid. The movie is engaging. The music is good. But, in the end, I walked out just not feeling like I know Elton John any better than I had before.I know the comparisons to Bohemian Rhapsody are unavoidable, but that really WAS a better movie. The same basic story, but at the end of Bohemian Rhapsody you felt emotionally charged. I didn't leave this movie feeling the same way.",Rocketman

It did not have the energy, excitement, and irresistible appeal of Bohemian Rhapsody. It will be impossible for people to not make the comparison with Bohemian Rhapsody being so recently released. However, maybe Rocketman will appeal more to critics, since they just didn't seem to ""get it"" with Bohemian Rhapsody. I guess the overall success (worldwide) and the many awards (including a Golden Globe for best picture and an Oscar for Rami Malek) spoke to whether the critics or the public knew what they were talking about.",Rocketman

The film does concentrate on Elton's emotions as well as the fact and it is hard at times to pity a man who has had the world at his feet. But the film and acting goes in to some detail explaining why he felt like this. And just like a rocky film he overcomes his trials and tribulations and heroically pulls through.
A great film if your an EJ fan.",Rocketman
408,Koma-Mo,"Everything I wanted ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" to be.",8,26 August 2019,"I do not hate the film, but I do not like the reputation that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has received (Best Picture nomination, seriously!?) and thought that it was a hugely overrated film filled with flaws. What that film failed to do, this film did it in spades. The film does follow the typical beats of a biopic and it's a formula that is hard to get away from. However, what director Dexter Fletcher did here was to focus onto the life of Elton John as a musical and in a very nice fashion, used various songs of his to tell this story and I thought that was brilliant. I don't know much detail about Elton John, so it was nice to learn a little about this great singer and to know the life that he had lived. If you've seen or heard stories about famous musicians, they tend to tell the same story and had similar problems from addiction to music producers. This is no exception as this film does tell a similar tale, but at the same time, I was intrigued with this film and just enjoyed watching this story. Another great point is that the people involved in this movie did a great job recreating some parts of his life, but to make costumes that are really close to the original. The best thing that this film had done was to have me interested and wanting to listen to his music.I've always liked Taron Edgerton and I thought he was absolutely phenomenal here as he acted his butt off and actually sang proving how great of an actor he is. Without a doubt, he really deserves an Academy Award nomination for this role. From the first time you see him, he embodied himself as Elton John and for the whole film, he was able to bring so much emotion to his role, allowing us as a viewer to connect and sympathize with him. His singing is amazing and I really liked the fact that he actually sang those songs rather than using another person to sing it for him. Edgerton is not only the stand out role as every single person in this film was great! Jamie Bell was great and I never knew he had singing chops. Richard Madden was amazing and brought a sense of cynicism to his character. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh as the parents of Elton were such terrible parents, especially the father and their performances were so good that you simply despise them and sympathize more with Elton. I won't say much, but I absolutely hated his father in this movie.One of the major surprises of the film was that this was a full on musical. I expected to see the basic biopic story, but to tell this story as a musical and actually using his music as a base to tell the story was a pretty smart choice. Most of the musical numbers were extravagant with great visuals and unique shots, along with having a cast who can sing. Each number did allow us to see what Elton was going through, from his ups and downs to showing part of his life that was filled with joy to this downward spiral he had entered due to his addiction.I'm praising this film a lot, but I did have a few minor gripes. I did feel that there were parts of the movie, mostly in the third act that dragged a bit, which felt that the film had gone a tad bit too long. Also, some of the musical numbers, as well sung as they were, felt a bit too overbearing in the third act and I felt that the movie focused more on the singing rather than the actual dialogue. There are moments where after a song, the characters will briefly talk and then the film will jump to a new song. I would have been nice to have a little breather in between rather than having a slew of songs being sung back to back.Overall, this is definitely one of the best films of this year and Edgerton does deserve an Oscar nod for his performance here. If you love musicals or are interested in the life of Elton John, then I highly recommend this film.",Rocketman
409,kim_singh,"Not a biopic, a masterful production",9,9 April 2020,"Not a biopic, a masterful production. As with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", I was never much of a Freddie Mercury fan, but loved the movie. I have been much into Elton John, but I adored the film.

410,isaacj02,Egerton shines in electric take on the biopic genre,7,17 June 2019,"Last year's Oscar-winning Queen medley Bohemian Rhapsody certainly proved that the tried and tested musical biopic is still a favoured subgenre among audiences, blending the highs and lows of artist's lives with all their greatest hits. Rhapsody's quasi-director, Dexter Fletcher takes on another charismatic and troubled figure in Rocketman, an ode to the song-writing legend that is Elton John. Fletcher's film is a fervid breath of fresh air on the biopic scene, a moving and undeniably feel-good flick that takes a look at the height of Elton's turbulent career. Rocketman is not your straight biopic by any means; first and foremost, it's an unashamed musical that dismisses the chronology of Elton's music for a smartly crafted jukebox soundtrack of some of the singer's most memorable tunes. The form of Rocketman is a stroke of genius from Dexter Fletcher; gone are the limits of factuality and linear storytelling, in favour of time-jumping and metaphors... all complete with the Elton-esque pizazz of a modern musical. From the beginning, Rocketman sets itself out from the crowd and the ride that follows is a gripping tale of love, talent and the tempestuous nature of fame.
Perhaps the greatest asset lies in a brilliant central performance from Taron Egerton. Where Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury was a remarkable turn in impressionism, Egerton's portrayal of Elton is an altogether meatier performance full of unbridled charisma and nuance. It is said that the film's subject himself requested that Egerton refrain from an impersonation and instead play ""his own version"" of Elton John; this certainly comes through in Egerton's role, less of an impression but still a masterful turn from the actor, who simply engulfs the part. The supporting cast here is strong too; Jamie Bell's Bernie Taupin is a heartfelt performance and Bryce Dallas Howard is unrecognisably nasty as Elton's distant mother. Richard Madden's portrayal of the star's manager and lover John Reid is a little predictably 'boo-hiss', but this is masked by some other delightful appearances (Stephen Graham briefly steals the show by practically chewing the scenery in the first third).
Dexter Fletcher casts a smooth hand over the production, proving himself to be a sure maestro of the musical genre. Though perhaps some songs could have been more suitably placed, there are some gorgeous moments that really make use of both the energy and heart of Elton's music; a rendition of 'Your Song' sung solo by Egerton at the piano is slow and goose bump-worthy whereas the 'Saturday Night's Alright' sequence early on in the film is a joyous burst of colour and choreography. It is of course well known that much of John's career wasn't all blissful song and dance; Rocketman takes its time to reflect on the issues of substance abuse and sexuality, often in a thoughtful and compassionate way. The film certainly doesn't hide away from the flaws of its subject... and it is in Elton's many faults that the most impactful moments appear. While most of it is expertly paced, the final third suffers a little from a meandering focus, becoming a slightly repetitive chorus of psychedelic escapades and impassioned arguments that certainly takes the scenic route towards what ends up being a pleasing, if slightly cheesy conclusion.
In the end, however, there is so much that is excellent about Rocketman that makes up for its problems. It is not necessarily revolutionary (certainly not in its story) yet still manages to give its own flavour to the often placid biopic, using the music of its star not just as a plot aspect but as a structural device that really makes everything tick. Rocketman is an honest depiction of fame, both of its hardships and triumphs; it may not be all smooth sailing (with Elton's life and the film itself), but Fletcher puts forward a vigorously entertaining piece of work, bolstered by an outstanding Taron Egerton. If nothing else, you'll appreciate the mesmerising musicality of it all.",Rocketman

415,kbohna,I'm not sure why they made it a sing-along Musical.,3,4 July 2019,The hugest problem with this movie is that they simply screwed up. If you compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody this is a flop. Elton characters played beautifully but between all of the beautiful takes there are these ridiculous sing along songs and it simply rooms the film to the point where it is almost unwatchable. Acting is phenomenal everything is phenomenal but for some reason some idiot up top decided let's let the cast sing along through the movie instead of just showing him on stage singing the greatest songs of all time we have to listen to him play with other people in nightclubs and so forth singing songs with him which does not make any sense. I was so disappointed that the talent they brought to this film was ruined by the direction that they followed and we can only blame the director and the screenwriter for this mishap. What were they thinking they should be fired and no one should ever talk to them ever again they should probably die in an unmarked grave when they get old and gray.,Rocketman

This film was just F**cking EPIC!!!This film is how all biopics about rock stars should be done. It wast't the most historically accurate, didn't follow the most chronological storyline, but it showed the life of Elton John soooooo well. The film gave just enough historical accuracy to make a great biopic, but also presented Elton John just the way you want to see him. Rock Star films are similar to Superhero films in the way that we want to relate to them in a personal way, but we also just want to see them at their very best. Rocketman achieved this perfectly!I film never really shows Elton writing a song. You never get this taking pen to paper song writing process. Instead, you genuinely get to see how the life he lived affected his song writing and where the song really came from in his heart. I loved this style of story telling. It really gave the full story Sir Elton John from the worst of the worst to the best of the best, and I loved every minute of it.Taron Egerton gave the performance of a lifetime as Elton John. I don't think they could have cast a better actor for the role if they would have had a lifetime to do so. I will deeply surprised if he doesn't win an award for bringing this film to life.

428,bournejackal,A musical journey,7,17 February 2020,"RocketmanLast night I watched the movie Rocketman. Starring Taron Egerton as Elton John. The movie is another music biography, but this is a musical biography. Which is different in biography movies.Taron Egerton did a wonderful job portraying and singing Elton's songs. We all know that Elton didn't like Rami Malek for winning a Oscar. For a movie he didn't sing and he got Taron to sing his songs. He wanted it to be authentic and real. Well he did.The movie, Which I thought it was pretty decent, odd at first but got better during the movie.
The movie is something to behold. I did like the storyline of how he became Elton. Elton has some iconic songs and I wish they showed how those songs come about. That's all I want. I wanted to know how Tiny Dancer & Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was made . Now we know on how I'm still standing came about, but that's all I want.The cast of characters were good, not great. Now I did like Jamie Bell as Berne Taupin. He as great , wish there was more of him in the movie. I would have liked how he come up with those iconic songs.The music is to be by far the best of it. Truly love hearing, Your song, Tiny Dancer & Sorry seems to be the hardest word. Those are my favorites.
Now is wish they didn't end it like it did, I wanted to know more after his drug infested rehab and how he became who he is now and the other songs he sung.Overall this was a entertaining movie to watch.

The real Elton John was a short doughy man when he was young, and a short fat man as he aged. The actor that plays him has a real man's physique, totally different from Elton's.

After intermission, there were fewer than ten cars left, but I can write that off mostly to the bone-headed move on the theater owner's part to put these two movies together, which are nothing alike and have two completely different target markets.
Anyway, what was good: the acting, performance, and costumes. No complaints there. What was less than stellar: the musical numbers. They were all tightly abbreviated; when you just start to get into a groove or a song, it stops, which made it noticeably different from any other musical I've seen. What was bad: the entire premise. I went into this movie doubtful about what kind of drama could be written about Elton John that would make for a riveting story, and I was right. It seemed the whole thing was about how his parents sucked and he needed therapy for it. I'm not questioning anyone's personal struggle with such issues at all; that said, I had rotten parents too and it simply wouldn't make for a compelling story or movie, especially if that were the lion's share of any hardship I faced in life.

440,jp7570,"An amazing performance, but a predictable story",5,5 October 2019,"As many have noted, Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John was amazing, and the music was well done. But the movie follows a very predictable path that we've seen many times before (recently in Bohemian Rhapsody, and even to an extent in the many iterations of A Star is Born).You know the pattern - struggling musician rises from low-income background, becomes massive global superstar, battles with substance abuse and alcoholism, pushes away those that were close to him, then resolves everything by the third act. While in some cases the protagonist dies (Rhapsody), in this film everyone lives ""happily ever after"" - that's to be expected since Elton was the executive producer.My impression was that the movie tried to be too comprehensive. It could have focused more on his early days and the build up to his first taste of success, giving us more detail about his ""broken family"". Why did his first father leave? Why did his mother say she was protecting Reg/Elton from him? What were the mother's issues with her family? These things seemed to greatly impact Reg/Elton, but we don't have a clue as to why?Anyone that has been aware of Elton John probably knows his back story - fake marriage to hide his sexuality, addictions, etc. This movie didn't offer much more than we already knew.In the end, the acting and musical performances were very well done, but the story was so familiar as to make the movie almost instantly forgettable.",Rocketman

444,oldmovies1185,Here is what many people don't understand,9,19 May 2019,"This is not a movie about a rock star with their music simply part of the facts of the story. It is a musical in the truest sense, that uses his own music to show his tribulations through the eyes of a man during the troubled years of his life. The movie is not always chronological and in some cases is more figurative than historical. In this way it can convey Sir Elton John's life and struggles in a way that the viewer may understand on a more personal level. The acting, writing and singing are superb.
The star did not try to truly imitate Elton but instead preforned the pieces in his own style that he molded as closely as possible to the original. It sounds odd, but it works.
As always you can never sum up any life, book or story in a 2 or so hour movie, but this comes close. You leave feeling like you really got to know the real, yet flawed, human Elton John. Overall a wonderful movie.",Rocketman
445,Elcid_Asaei,Awful Sacrifice of a Film,1,4 June 2019,"You don't have to be an Elton John fan or vice-versa, to watch this film and come out of the theater with the feeling of ""who cares"", since Rocketman is that kind of 2 hour waste of ones life in a film that hardly anybody will remember a few weeks after watching. But why am I being so harsh, you might say? Well, for one, this is unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, a very emotionally drained film, with really poor acting performances from leads.Taron Egerton tries hard to play a confused and impressionable Elton, yet his performances fall flat, as we never really feel we are invested in his problems, and in fact come to find him rather annoying by the end of the film. Yet the award for poor performance must go to Bryce Dallas Howard, whose clumsy effort to speak cockney and her wooden acting leave one with the sense that she was reading off a page held in front of her, off camera! In fact every scene she appears in goes from bad to worse, and together with Taron, the critical relationship between mother and son falls flat emotionally.The other aspect that really makes a mockery of this film is the very premise, as it seems to be a pale copy of Bohemian Rhapsody, with every shift in the narrative being a poor carbon copy of that superior film. This is not a surprise as it was Dexter Fletcher who came aboard Bohemian Rhapsody when Bryan Singer left the film, so similarities abound, yet where Bohemian Rhapsody was actually emotionally invested, this is just a 'meh' film that ends with us less sympathetic to Elton John than when we began the journey.",Rocketman

452,dloft59,"Solid, imaginative, great lead actor, but . . .",8,25 August 2019,"I went to see ""Rocketman"" in early June 2019. It's a fine movie for its type, with the usual strengths (hardworking talent, no expense spared for artistic set design, undeniably great music) and weaknesses (somewhat pedestrian and predictable as well as episodic and fragmentary plot) of the genre.It does make greater imaginative use of both music and visuals than last year's slightly more straight-ahead biopic, ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" But I also found it oddly less moving.I never owned a single Elton LP. At the peak of his fame, in my mid teens, I was already a dedicated prog-head, spending endless hours listening to Yes, ELP, and Gentle Giant (a band led by three brothers who had previously been a UK pop outfit known as ""Simon Dupree and the Big Sound,"" with whom young Reg Dwight toured for a time), as well as my older Deep Purple and Creedence albums, and select items from my father's extensive classical and jazz library.But I know I had the ""Crocodile Rock"" and ""Daniel"" 45rpm singles. And Elton was an integral part of the general, public soundtrack of my adolescence. My girlfriend had the _Madman Across the Water_ LP, someone in my college dorm perpetually blasted ""Funeral for a Friend"" out the windows into the courtyard, and all the singles drilled themselves into my brain from the radio.It struck me that these classic rock biopics are pretty similar to all the comic superhero feature films of the past decade or more (most of which I've skipped). Both types begin with the same easy appeal to one's nostalgia, hooking you swiftly into your past -- the people you dated, the places you hung out, the friends you had, maybe even the clothes you wore, as well as your more direct memories and feelings about the tunes and plots.Which is what makes them instantly enchanting but ultimately -- for me -- disappointing and even empty. They can never fully bring back our past, and too often they fail to hook precisely into our deepest personal zeitgeist. There's an initial thrill of recognition as a character or melodic motif sneaks into the story, and then an almost inevitable letdown as it does its thing, which is never quite what your thing was with it when you were young and much more impressionable.Several times during ""Rocketman"" as well as ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" I just wanted to close my eyes and shut out the visuals because -- no matter how imaginative, how colorful, how hard-working the actors, dancers, and set design -- it didn't live up to my rich emotions and memories about the item being evoked . . . because it was mine, and because it's long gone.Whatever I was seeing mostly diminished the beauty and majesty of the songs, rather than embodied them or did them justice. Sometimes I want to cringe.I find myself much more deeply moved and impressed by movies about people I've never heard of, in stories I've never encountered (e.g., ""Blinded By the Light,"" ""Maiden,"" and ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"").",Rocketman
453,LoganJEcclesLoganSmash,two movies in one,6,2 September 2019,"Ok, I'm sure that headline is confusing but hear me out and I'll explain it. This film tries to fuse a ""Mama Mia' type movie with a biopic film in the vein of say ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" Does it succeed in this fusion? It's not for me to say. I watched the whole film. However, I do feel like it Id liked it better if it just stuck with the Mama Mia-isqe theme throughout. I understand the want of life details in this film, Elton Jhon is a very interesting man, this story needed to be told. But, the separate themes contrast at times, in my opinion, making it come off a little messy. Once again I did fully watch and enjoy it so I do recommend this movie. The main reason I recommend this movie, other than its just fun, is Taron Egertons' character work.Taron is so good in this film. To the little gestures to the big dramatic, he does such a good job of channeling Sir Elton. My favorite thing he does is the signature Elton smirk he nails it and it made me giggle every time.

459,tbuchalski,"Rocketman: My Good, Bad, and Ugly",8,10 July 2019,"The Good:
With a spate of jukebox musical tributes to 20th century masters coming to theaters in recent years Fletcher offers up Rocketman about the early life and career of Elton John. Rather than break up the drama with re-enacted performances, Rocketman infuses elements from classical Hollywood musicals. By telling the story through a series of flashbacks the film benefits from being seen through the creative and sometimes imaginative memory of John himself, so the presentation includes musical set pieces of song and dance and bits of fantasy. These deviations from strict realism remind us that John is perhaps an unreliable narrator and add vibrancy that's absent in contemporary musician biopics that are stale and generic by comparison.The Bad:
With a British actors cast in most of the British parts, Bryce Dallas Howard's casting to play Elton's mother, Sheila, is perplexing. Her star status is quite jarring from her first appearance on screen. While her performance is perfectly dastardly at times, her transformation is somehow incomplete. Because her role is less and less prominently featured as the film goes on, the overall effect of her presence is diminished and the film suffers less as a whole. To say the least of this film is this poorly cast, but well performed, role is a testament to the film's composition and the other performances.The Ugly:
Although it's not a biopic, Across the Universe (Julie Taymor, 2007) exemplifies the jukebox musical in its showcase of some of the Beatles most popular songs, and the inclusion of classical Hollywood's most successful musicals. The musical set pieces of Rocketman that lift it above other biopics, like Bohemian Rhapsody, are almost exclusively how the music of The Beatles was showcased in Taymor's film. Rocketman would have certainly benefited from taking a similar tack, but because Elton John and his real-life performances were so colorful and ostentatious, the set pieces used early in the film fade in favor of performances re-enacted.",Rocketman

9.5/10
""Biopics have never gone as far out of this world as much as Rocketman does, never shying away from a story that is important to music history.""After Bohemian Rhapsody, one could never imagine another biopic that could top that gold star. Look no further, because we may have a, dare I say it, better biopic on our hands. Rocketman is a very new take on what this type of movie is known for, based on Elton John's story (whether you're a fan or not), going down the road of being a musical. At first, I was skeptical because the unexpected hit me and I didn't know how to feel about a ""musical biopic"", however the film managed to excite and surpass my skepticism. Elton John was a very colorful person (known weird during his time) and Rocketman somehow captures that magic by never holding back from some outrageous dance sequences and some very on point costume design. The story strategically blends a good amount of drama which can be emotionally unsettling at times due to the realistic depictions of daily life issues, all the while still being able to put a smile on your face. The story does well with giving a straightforward narrative, and tackles some important topics  but never forced either. Lastly, Taron Egerton blew my mind! As the guy playing Eggsy from Kingsman, this role is the role he was born for just like Malek was born for Mercury. The delivery, the sass, the style, even his own vocals, everything is perfect about this performance, never trying to mimic Elton but rather portraying and interpretation of him. It's fun to watch, and exciting to know!
Verdict: Rocketman is a biopic for the books that brings new aspects to the genre, all the while giving you the unforgettable Egerton performance. You cannot miss this!",Rocketman

464,jeroboam-26661,Well crafted rock biography/musical,8,17 February 2020,This movie will always be compared to Bohemian Rhapsody and I think it compares pretty well. The addition of the Hollywood musical element works and it's always great to hear the great tunes you grew up with scattered throughout the movie to help tell the story.The one thing holding this movie back is the pacing and it feels like it's about a half hour too long. The leading performance is good but definitely not up to Rami Malek standards. Overall the acting could have been a bit more dynamic and less dry. I think they spent too much time on some things and not enough on others which makes the movie a little uneven. I do however like the style in which they chose to tell the story and themes that keep popping up tying the story together. 8/10,Rocketman

So it is mostly very enjoyable and pleasing to the eye to watch - your eye will have a lot to watch. It naturally has the majestic moments in the huge concert arenas as you might expect in this kind of film, too. It brings up important aspects of the difficulties John faced in his childhood home - as here too, often from the most difficult & challenging of homes & families can arise the best and most virtuous of talents. Seeking for acceptance not found in the basic structures of life - your childhood family and the people surrounding you the closest - can sometimes lead one into greatest heights of achievements.I think I would have liked this movie more as a ""real life movie"" featuring the songs in an ordinary way, instead of a musical. I'm not a huge fan of musicals anyway.What I didn't want and need to see, however, was the abundant gay sex and even gay orgies. I could have looked them up from that kind of sites should I want to - not in a movie meant for everyone to see. Mainly for this reason I only give 3 stars.",Rocketman

Using the complete discography to tell Elton's story is accomplished with great selections that we all know and love.Interestingly, nothing from Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, which was the biography LP in 1975 of Elton and Bernie's career, made it as a song selection. (the first LP to debut at Number 1 in music history)Fortunately, I was able to watch Rocket Man a second time which brought into focus how the fantasy process was being used to tell Elton's story.Overall, this is very enjoyable and reveals that it will take a mini-series to chronologically and accurately tell Elton's story. I mean he has had a Number One song in FOUR different decades.That is the internal conflict for long time Elton fans when a movie shows Grow Some Funk of Your Own as a song earlier in his life and career than Madman Across the Water. The first was from 1975 and the second was from 1971.(note: neither song is in the movie and only serve as examples)So really, what you have is a musical fantasy that is hiding a biography and it is really well done.",Rocketman

Once you understand that, the movie is quite good. The choice of songs is great and the singer are pretty good. Except for the 8 year old Elton John. That kid is amazing! I'm talking extraordinary here. I thought the child in Coco was amazing. Specially the singer in the Mexican version. But this child is FAR better. A rising star no doubt.

This was a wonderful movie. Unlike a lot of biopics, it didn't gloss over Elton's issues, his sexuality or his flaws. There were times when I wanted him to go ahead and lie because it would have made everything so much easier but it would have just made it easier to watch.
The music. OMG The Music! Egerton sings the songs his way and his way is wonderful. The only way I can describe it is that the music sounds like the music would have sounded if Elton John knew then what he knows now. Does that make sense? There is a richness and fullness to the musical numbers.
I was probably a third of the way into the movie before I realized Bryce Dallas Howard was his mum. I'm impressed once again how the daughter of arguably the nicest man in Hollywood can play such a horrific role. (See The Help). As the mother of a gay son, I truly wanted to smack her.
It's not a movie for the faint of heart, but then again, neither is real life. It had some dark parts, and truly sad moments but it is uplifting and beautiful and I applaud the courage Elton John has shown in letting this be a ""warts and all"" story. It could have been so much less.",Rocketman

478,GeneralUrsus,Rocketman Soars,10,2 June 2019,"This moving, heartfelt film documenting the life of Elton John is magnificent. It spans the years from his boyhood growing up in Pinner, England yearning for love from his cold father, his partnership with lyricist Bernie Taupin and his rise to super stardom.This is a warts and all tale featuring both the success and drug-fueled sadness of a man searching for love in his Circle of Life story. If you are a fan of Elton John, this film captures all of the notes and the tales you've read about. Director Fletcher has created a spectacle perfectly suited for an entertainer who has thrived on lavish lifestyle, costumes and crowd-pleasing performances.The songs chosen from the Elton/Taupin songbook perfectly mirror the particular scenes portrayed in the film, even if they don't match the specific era they were created in. This film is magical. A musical is the perfect fashion to present Elton John's life story, comprised of soulful solos to high-octane choreographed production numbers.Elton John's lift-off performance at the famed Troubadour in Los Angeles was the gig that catapulted his career. It's only fitting that both Elton and his mesmerized audience levitate into space as the gifted piano man bangs out an uproarious rendition of Crocodile Rock.Taron Egerton is a knockout and superb as Elton John, capturing all of the mannerisms, moves and speech patterns of this gifted, troubled musician. This is an Oscar-worthy performance that dances circles around Remy Malek. Egerton is a tour-de-force and triple threat as actor, singer and dancer. His vocal interpretations of John's music are rich and powerful. High praise too must be given to Jaime Bell for his poignant, touching portrayal of lyricist Bernie Taupin.The film beautifully depicts the relationship of the two artists from young men to super stars, a brotherhood and a bond, it is a love story all its own. The attention to detail from John's outlandish costumes and changing looks through the decades is spot on, the resemblance of Egerton to Elton by virtue of talented hair and costume designers is miraculous.This compelling, thoroughly enjoyable film will whisk you away and take you back to those golden days of youth and the Elton John songs you listened to growing up.

It's hard to explain what makes ""Rocketman"" a dud. Maybe you have to see it before you understand why and how it disappoints so much. It never lifts off.The actor playing E.J. does a good job, but I can't recall seeing him in anything else. There just has to be an interesting story worth telling and relating about this rock/pop star; however, this isn't it. If you skip it you won't be missing much. Apparently Elton liked it. Well, I didn't. Hopefully I have learned from these two recent misfires and in the future I'll ignore all the hype and wait until I can view 'x' for free, and then decide if it's a worthy addition to my library.",Rocketman
485,deblasiogwae,"TARON EGERTON is the real ""A Star is Born"".",10,5 June 2019,"There's a moment during the first half hr of Rocketman when Reggie is sitting at the piano in his robe. He looks at Taupin's lyrics and composes ""Your Song"".. His grandmother (who seems to be the only person who loved this lonely child) comes into the living room, sits down and then does something so beautiful it made me cry. She puts her hand to her chin and gazes in awe at what her grandson has produced. By this one gesture the director shows us what a genius Elton John was in his heyday. It's an overwhelming moment. I think even Taron himself may not realize just how great he is in this movie. It's a cliché to say in a biopic that ""he becomes"" the character he portrays. But Taron Egerton overcomes the cliché. He is breathtaking in this.",Rocketman

However, its how we respond and how much will-power we have that will determine how the story ends.
Elton made a choice was better off for it. We all face choices in our life and each path can lead to drastically different outcomes. No matter the hand your dealt or the position you find yourself in. How you play the game with ultimately decide your fate. When you reach rock bottom you can still fight your way back.

487,cupofsoulshow,Elton Rules,8,11 July 2019,"Rocketman is the story of Elton John's life set to music. It's starts from his childhood and ends with his comeback after rehab. We get everything we want and need in this film. An insight to his crazy rock and roll lifestyle, the over the top sequined costumes and the great music he created in the '70s. Amongst the fun, we get an insight look at his struggles. His fight for self-confidence and acceptance but mostly his need to be lovedAfter the last music biopic, we were holding our breaths about the release of Rocketman. I am happy to report it was worth the wait. This reviewer loves Elton John and was familiar with his life story, but this movie taught me some new things. Mainly how he and Bernie met. We also learned how challenging his parents were. It is said that that through great pain comes great art. If that is true, his parents set him up for a catalog of greatest hits.I wasn't surprised with Elton John's honesty just the sheer darkness he experienced at the height of his success. The hardest scenes to watch are the ones where his father reject him and the manipulation, he endured at the hands of John Reid played excellently by Richard Madden.I enjoyed that they made this more of a musical than a biopic. Don't misconstrue Rocketman is still about John's life, but the music drives this film. We are rooting for Elton. We want him to stop feeling inadequate. There's are parts of us that are silently whispering you're good enough.Taron Egerton did a fantastic job as Elton John. Elton has an incredibly soulful voice, and Taron did his songs justice. Jamie Bell is lovable as John's longtime writing partner Bernie Taupin. Their scenes together show a genuine love between two very different men bound by their dreams of rock n roll success.It's not easy to make a movie about someone that is such an icon, especially when he's still alive. Director Dexter Fletcher managed to make a film that utilizes John's extensive catalog while intelligently inserting the up's and downs of his life story. The audience is treated to a movie filled with music but learns that success doesn't fix childhood wounds. We walk away humming the songs and to quote Elton ""He's still Standing after all this time"".Scale: We give this movie an 8 for fun.",Rocketman
488,christianolivarez-78828,What a shy boy,8,1 June 2019,"Hello ladies and gentlemen. We're doing a quick review of Rocketman. Elton John is played by Taron Egerton and this musical follows his childhood into adulthood. That's right. It's a musical. So if you don't fancy musicals then I suggest waiting to rent it from your local movie store. Also, I feel the need to get it out of the way that Bohemian Rhapsody and this movie are very different but if i had to choose one, I'd go with Rocketman. That's all i will mention on that topic. I normally would give spoilers on a biopic but i guess this kind of gives a couple if you're unfamiliar so just a heads up. Okay, so you know who Elton John (who will be referred to in this review simply as EJ) is and such so no need for the overview, right babe?So the movie has a good starting point. EJ is in full costume and goes into an AA meeting where he gives all his flaws and how he's feeling stressed and such. Pretty quick right? The course of the movie does take a retrospective view on his life since he's in the meeting but it works. The build up from childhood through adulthood happens very very fast. He's a child prodigy pretty much and finds himself in a band before you know it. As a child he didn't have acceptance from his father and touch on the gay aspect right from the beginning which i thought was interesting. The comment is from his father when he was at least younger than 10 years old. So anyway, he's in this band and plays in the background. Before you even know what's going on he's already EJ. If you haven't picked up on it yet, this review is kind of like a check list, right? Yeah, so is the film.Don't get me wrong though. The acting is pretty great and you buy Taron Egerton as EJ right away. He's got a great voice and looks damn near similar so what else could you ask for? Not much. Remember this is a musical and even the performances are spot on great with the choreography and how they were weaved into the film. However, the film doesn't give you enough to really connect with the characters for the long run. It's like going to Costco and getting a bunch of samples. You know, it's good but you're kind of like ""meh"" I'm not gonna buy it. That's kind of how i felt with this movie.So getting into the performances. Unfortunately, it does have the same choppy feel as the other scenes but they are pretty amazing to say the least. The first show they play at the Troubadour is electrifying and exciting but it just doesn't last long. There's a big fantasy aspect to the film during the performances where it gives a euphoria feel where people are floating and all that stuff but it overtakes the actual performance if that makes sense. Ironically for a musical, the performances were very short in comparison to the other scenes. That's where I'm torn on this movie. It looks amazing and has the capacity to be an amazing movie, it just felt rushed. One huge example of this is when he gets married and divorced in, I kid you not, like 3 minutes. Who was the wife? Who knows and who cares because if you went to the bathroom you would have missed the whole thing. Kind of disappointing right?His character development is shown pretty creatively however. For a lot of the film hes very self-pity negative Neil and gets a little old naturally because we all get down and it's annoying, but he moves forward and says all the right things in really touching way. I understand that timeline is something that people are gonna moan and groan about it and i get it but let's face it, there's no way a Hollywood Movie is gonna get it perfect. Anyway, one of the best scenes i thought was when he comes out to his mother and she says something very hurtful and that was the most i connected with the character. I'm not gonna tell you of course since you should see this in theatres, but Tarons emotions and the depth from this scene really makes you feel for the guy. It simply is a great performance. Overall I was torn on this movie, but looking at it objectively, it was a pretty great movie and would see it again, likely. Not for sure for sure, but likely. I'm giving this movie a 7.6/10.",Rocketman
489,Realtruth99,"Egotistical Elton, as always",6,8 June 2019,"I watched this for the music, although I did suspect it would be heavily biased towards poor Elton being one of life's victims, and I was right. He ridiculously over played how 'cruel and evil' his father was to him (facts don't bear this out at all) and hugely under played the real life arrogant and egotistical Elton we see on various chat shows. Also the movie suggests the songs were all about him and his life (ego) which is simply not true.

A loose retelling of his life and people in it, hugely entertaining with big choreographed dance sequences. Don't care that it didn't stick to timelines (cos it's a film) or exact interactions (cos it's a film) because it's well-acted, well sung, the sex and drugs have been depicted far more gratuitously in tv shows like GoT and BBad so nothing at all shocking. Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell, and other leads have great singing voices, while the child actors who play Elton at different ages look spookily similar. This is a jukebox musical and is miles better than Bohemian Rhapsody in comparison.

Those symbolic moments are what mainly draw me to Rocketman.I also wasn't entirely into the romantic aspect of the movie (not that I'm a homophobic!)

However, I do think this movie suffered somewhat in popularity from being a little too much ""in your face"" with the gay sex scene and too many PDAs. Yes... we all know Elton John is gay- so it didn't need such graphic displays to offend audience members that aren't yet ""all in"" on the matter. I think Bohemian Rhapsody did a better job regarding Mercury's sexual preference.That said, John's story was definitely one worth telling and the acting was REALLY good. If you liked his music (not sure how anyone couldn't!), then you will enjoy the movie. Some of the music parts were a bit overdone and more fantasy than reality, and I would have liked more backstory behind the songs like in BR. It was a solid story about overcoming adversity and how such fantastical talent and popularity isn't what necessarily what will make a person happy in real life. Good movie.",Rocketman
501,briner8397,Old subjects handled creatively and with integrity,8,4 June 2019,"Unhappy childhood? Get in line. Successful people indulging addictions? Been there done that. On those levels Elton's life is rather typical, but somehow this story hits the right tone and even flights of fancy don't detract from Rocketman's authenticity. The music is MY story as a 1973 high school graduate; I remember exactly where I was when I heard Your Song for the first time; ditto Rocketman and other hits. That might make the audience for this film smallish, except the magic, cautionary tale, and struggle to reconcile makes it damn near universal. How sad it was that the previews I watched while waiting for Rocketman included an upcoming Judy Garland biopic Under The Rainbow -- wherein Judy's sad life from childhood to barely middle age is told anew accompanied by her stellar talent and indelible performances. Judy couldn't figure it out while Elton apparently has. Who should we try to emulate? In Rocketman I was also impressed by the perennial dilemma of how to film the creative process, including connecting with creative lyrics and doodling on the piano; in almost all other movies about composers the light bulb moment is comical but for some reason I can't pinpoint here it seemed real or at least plausible. Elton John is a rare talent who found himself in the right place at the right time and made the most of it. He could have easily been just another rock star dead in his 20s but he caught himself in time (with a little help from some of his friends). Rocketman deserves to do very well at the box office.",Rocketman

Proverbs 28:13from the first minute I was astounded. having watched no trailers or promotional material, I had no Idea that the lead would be Taron Egerton. I could not even recognize him at first because of how he wore the role on himself like wearing a costume. Giving a thousand-mile-stare behind flashy spectacles and a 5-o'clock shadow, which a wide chin that makes him appear even more like the beloved singer, and singing in a voice that can go high like young Reginald and low like Elton.the visual styling, choreography and musical adaptations all play homage to Elton John's lifetime of musical performances. making it flashy, memorable, quilt-woven and operatic, incomparable with Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) which fails many levels.as for the story-line and narrative, the film becomes an achievement by completing was every biography should accomplish - a character driven story that does not rely on the audience recognizing the protagonist. in that way, Rocketman (2019) delivers a character that people will relate to, with a message they can love - in the simplicity of self-love and it's importance for the addicts and lost souls everywhere.",Rocketman

Her acting is over-the-top, her accent isn't natural, and she looks far too young for the part. This is just total miss for me. Elton's music is phenomenal, but the pacing is also all over the place and it all felt rushed. This seems like nothing more than an attempt to ride the coattails of Bohemian Rhapsody's success, which was also a film that I wasn't too fond of. At least that one didn't have such weird musical numbers. I didn't realize how much I didn't need to see Richard Madden attempting to sing Elton John in a Kimono while filing his nails.

I would rather watch a documentary on Elton John. I feel the acting was average and was hoping the film would get better as went along. Well 20 minutes in and now it's starting to become a budget cut of ""Grease"" but not even close. Not sure why I haven't turned it off yet. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this and was able to stream it, so save your money.The movie gets a bit better when they introduce Bernie Taupin and how Elton finally started out his career, this is more of how I would have like to see the movie portrayed. A beautiful moment happens when they finally write and record ""Your Song""...the movie is finally taking a turn for the better. But then at the Troubadour show it went back to the theatrics they don't help the movie out. So now back to the ""musical film"" it's almost like they couldn't make their minds up when creating this, it's too bad because it's such a wonderful story.I do have to say that Taron Egerton gives a decent performance as he usually does and is the highlight of this film but once again in brief moments due to writing and directing. If you are into musicals then this film is for you, if not then you may throw up a little in your mouth, just kidding but you will have a hard time with this one.The whole confession room scenes are somewhat small roles that really don't need to be there and my guess is a creative concept that failed. Some of those more emotional scenes could have been played better but the were to quick and far and few between. It's also hard to distinguish what is factual and what is Hollywood.Watching him get self destructive was very sad to see but as a musician and songwriter I could relate, but definitely a more realistic sense of what Elton was going through at that period of his life. I did like the way the music entwined Elton's life story with movie and certain scenes. The thing that brings it down is the the ""routines"" that go along with the songs in parts like his suicide was in poor taste.Towards the end it starts to become repetitive from scene to scene and the downfall of Elton which makes the movie a bit depressing but this was his life. At least the costume changes kept it interesting. When the movie finally gets to the ending it obviously resolves from how it opened up and sheds light on Elton's understanding of himself and life.I'm glad he has been sober for 28 years the music world would not be the same without him, I only wish the movie had a more serious approach, for me it was ok and the 2 hours was not completely wasted.",Rocketman

I started watching the movie with a negative feeling that I also wouldn't like the movie...but from the very beginning it was entertaining. The parts where he was a boy were really good. I did enjoy how they play his music during the various scenes. I must say it served its purpose. I was very entertained. Very informative. You see his struggles and success. I personally met him a couple of times as I lived in Atlanta and attended several of his big fundraising gay parties. Great job by the main actors Taron Egerton and Jamie Bell.

517,jortegasa,Music and pain,8,2 June 2019,"I love Elton John, his music has been a huge part of my life over my 40 years on this planet. So to see him get the biopic treatment is just crazy. I know the talk when it comes to these types of movies is on how close to life they are and how much stuff is left out. This was one of the issues that just drove me crazy with Bohemian Rhapsody. The time line was moved around so much that as a big Queen fan I noticed that years and events did not match up. Well I happy to say that this time around that didn't matter because while this is a biopic still, the take was on a more fantasy journey so the timeline didn't matter.So I am not going to waste time telling you who Elton John is. If you don't know then you have some big damn issues in your life. But the movie traces his life from when he first started playing the piano to around the time in the mid-80's when he started to get cleaned. We get all the high's and low's, the nasty family backstory and heartbreaking lovers along the way. It doesn't always paint John in a perfect light and so you feel some of his pain along the way. But the story would be nothing if the music was not great, which it was. Taron Everton does a great job at painting the piano singer but so does everyone in the cast. I loved how so much of the music was mixed in and how it didn't hold it's self to that whole time line thing. A great example of that would be when we hear the song I Want Love sung when he was a kid, when of course that is a song from the 1990's. This was a flat out great musical that never loses focus on who the star is, Elton John. Another aspect that I am glad was in focus was his personal relationships. Yes we all know that John is gay, but we are reminded that everyone is hurt and fooled no matter what your sexual orientation is.So should you see this? Yes, yes, yes. Right now. And love it because his story can be our story even if we never were rock stars or famous. We all have lived rich lives and have had pain along the way.",Rocketman

It's disjointed making it hard to follow how the various events affected his life and his music. And Egerton's acting doesn't make it easy to watch either. It changes from flat and uninspired to frantic and over-the-top. And I question if some of the events actually happened. Did Elton John actually walk out on a diving board, announce he was going to kill himself, and then try to drown himself in front of a bunch of guests?

I cringed for the first 21 minutes and finally pulled the plug. Worst money I ever spent on a movie.

As a kid I never liked his choice of eye wear! I completely got over this by the time I reached 18 years and started buying his back tracks. This film was brilliant and I loved every minute.It was heartwarming, made me laugh and smile and cry in places. The music was outstanding and more than anything, I really really warmed to Elton so much, it's time to buy his music again!There must have been some tough scenes for Elton himself to reflect on. Hugs to a great person, human being and super star ! This film is a must to watch",Rocketman
534,starburst-16601,"A Really Human Story, but worth 1 time viewing",6,25 June 2019,"Rocketman, in many ways is a rather generic musical biopic. Imagine the colorful musical numbers from Across the Universe with the persona humanization of Nowhere Boy, even to the recent Bohemian Rhapsody. In performance, Egerton is a superb embodiment of Elton's anxty sass. It is in grasping the traits the man himself has that the story is superbly human. By holding his most human struggle of knowing love as the vein of the Elton John biopic and with Teron carrying that struggle in his physicality, this film will move you to tears. It creates a total understanding of who Elton is from the very intimate inside to the flamboyant show he puts on. Rocketman is a wonderful watch for seeing a very human story, the depiction of his alcoholism wrecked me it's so real. The other half of the musical biopic however, is the spectacle of the music. It was just fine. Seeing as much of the story is told by stepping through the musical catalog of Elton (what you expect from genre) when it is fine song show after another fine spectacle, viewing gets winded, where you just want the story. Therefore I give it a 6 and say it is a great film, but only worth viewing once to grasp the emotional life of Elton, so glad to know after, but never again as the music and campy fun of it isn't all there to make it as lovable as say Mama Mia as an example of how musical catalogs be displayed. The frivolity of what you want was over steeped in Britishness.",Rocketman
535,drd-07217,Bohemian Rapsody it ain't!,3,2 June 2019,Mmm while this fantasy retelling of Dwight's life is vaguely entertaining to a point it does not have the flow and homely character of Queen's biopic. This is a film about a talented but self indulgent person who desperately wants you to forgive him for all the bad things you've heard about him. After a while it goes around in circles and peters out and instead of a rousing concert hit song to go out on you are left with a song that most people will not even know? The Gay love scenes were unnecessary and will turn many away I feel. Also the film does not know if it is a musical or a docu drama? Nice try but we've been spoilt with BH.,Rocketman

Not deep enough. The lead role actor was great. Had to do what he could with a banal script
Far better is bohemian rhapsody. That was brilliantly written. Sensitively told
I would have thought that someone with Elton's amazing creative talents would not have allowed this interpretation of his life story to be told.

It was well written, great story and it was clear the way they explained everything.
I like how in the end during credits they explain his current status.
This one had scenes in of concerts but a different vibe than Bohemian Rhapsody. In this one they made you see what he felt when he was performing instead of making you feel like you were there as a spectator enjoying the live concert. It was still brilliantly done.",Rocketman

540,brexitstageleft,Quality musical for non Elton fans too,8,14 July 2020,"I've never been a massive fan of musicals. I loved The Wizard of Oz as a kid, quite like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Little Shop of Horrors and Grease, but that was about it. But the recent trend of more modern feeling musicals, (such as The Greatest Showman) that don't just burst into random songs for no obvious reason, has revived my interest in the genre.I've also never been fond of Elton John's music. It's always been there in the background, like supermarket music. Inoffensive but nothing to get interested about. However, i found this to be a really good watch. I loved Egerton in Eddie the Eagle and he hits the same heights here.I now realise the reason i've never been interested in Elton John. He has become a caricature of himself. I know Elton has had numerous health issues, so i don't want to sound mean about his singing, but in truth i just don't think he's a very good singer. The stardust is the songs and they are much better written than i would ever have thought. The (censored) is Back and Tiny Dancer are particular highlights. I imagine Elton was a much better singer in his younger years and i now feel much more appreciative of his talents. I wish i could go back in time to be at one of those early days concerts. I'm sure they were magical.His songs sound so different with a fresh, youthful, more subtle voice singing them. I think the film pays a wonderful tribute to Elton's musical talents, without the over the top singing he has become known for.The human element comes across very well too, without dragging a fun, upbeat movie into depression. I had a similar childhood, parents that many Britons of a certain vintage can relate to. Also Matthew Illesley is a potential star in the making, he reminds me of a young Ernie Wise. A born showman.",Rocketman
541,sheltonemma,Taron outstanding,7,1 June 2019,"Fantastic energetic effervescent movie, just like Elton's live performances, the film manages to keep the energy flowing throughout with great set pieces and astounding performance by Taron who becomes Elton and doesn't put a foot wrong. Dexter's direction is inspired and has shades of Tommy to my mind. Absolutely reminds you of what a great team Elton and Bernie made and doesn't skirt over anything. Musical arrangements really worked well and Taron bursts with talent and energy.",Rocketman
542,mark-4203,A long sizzle reel for the stage musical?,5,28 April 2020,"I knew we were in trouble when I heard that Elton was making it himself as such vanity projects rarely turn out well. However, my wife saw it on a flgight back to LA from NY and said it was great. OK, I'll give it a try.Ak. It started out in rehab and ended in rehab. It's not so much a BioPic as a sort of tale of a star's rehab struggles, which is fine for a documentary.Where was the story of ""Yellow Brick Road"", which was a flash on the screen in a montage, where are the rest of the band? What's up with that weird Kiki Dee scene which just kind of ends? I remember at the time Elton was so kind to help resurrect Kiki's career which was floundering and it just sort of drops into the movie. Weird. Yellow Brick Road hit us all at school (I was going boarding school in the UK in the 70s so this was my generation) and it was amazing. We listened to it until the record was worn out.Taron Egerton was sort of ""OK"". Too tall, too well-built but too little musical skill to carry off the famous tunes. I mean everyone in the world knows the great Elton John songs so why not use 'em?? Or start singing in the actors's voice then cut away to the real tune?",Rocketman
543,mjkpbm,Like an old-school musical; enjoyed it anyway,8,30 August 2019,"Surprisingly, this is a film in which characters suddenly burst into song. Sometimes troops of dancers glide onscreen to support them. Not what I expected, but I did like this movie. It features strong performances by the leads. The Elton John songs that form ALL of the soundtrack were carefully chosen to tie in to the story. The best example: the ""Rocketman"" chorus (""I'm not the man they think I am at all"") fits perfectly with crises going on in Elton John's life, including his conflicted homosexuality. The sheer number of great songs, one after another, bang bang bang, makes it clear (as if anyone really needed reminding) how outstanding John and Taupin's songwriting was, in the early years at least. Hearing them again in this context, all in a single sitting and accompanied by great visuals, was totally different from hearing this familiar music on classic rock radio for the one-thousandth dreary time.I kept wondering how a film like this about real living people could actually be brought to the screen. After all, it depicts a lot of very personal stuff about John's relationship with his parents (who are depicted in an unfavorable light, to say the least), his spoiled behavior and so on. Why would John and Taupin agree to let such a film even exist. But then the closing credits reveal that Elton John is ""executive producer,"" which made me wonder if this was in some sense his personal vanity project. Even so, it's a fine film.NB: For Soft Machine fans, there's an unexpected surprise. I'd forgotten that Elton Dean and Elton John worked together in Bluesology. That's depicted briefly in the early part of the film.",Rocketman

545,timlee19,"It's difficult not to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody (and detrimentally so), but on it's own merits it's certainly worth a watch",7,8 April 2021,"First of all I must confess I've never been the biggest fan of Elton John. There are a few of his songs that I do love, such as 'Your Song,' 'Tiny Dancer,' 'Sacrifice' and 'I'm Still Standing,' and I admire his talent as a songwriter, especially in the early seventies. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which told the story of one of my alltime favourite performers and songwriters, I was less excited going in to see this biopic.I have to say though, they did a great job. Taron Egerton is convincing and compelling as Elton, and you certainly sympathise more with the notoriously 'difficult' Elton when you see the struggles he's been through in his life, from coming to terms with his sexuality, to drug addiction and dealing with manipulative managers.Of course a film like this will always hinge on the music, and the performances and cinematography for these scenes works really well. I preferred the less 'obvious' use of the music in Bohemian Rhapsody perhaps, and it drifts into over-sentimentalism at times for me.But overall, it is a well produced and paced film. It's difficult not to compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody (and detrimentally so), but on it's own merits it's certainly worth a watch.",Rocketman

Don't get me wrong I love a musical, I will even give Grease 2 a go but this is just horrible.

552,elliot-75668,Musical-fantasy biopic soars,8,31 May 2019,"If there's one thing the movie industry is good at it is noticing a slight trend and then trying to capitalise on it. Even though an Elton John biopic has been in the works for years, the success of A Star is Born and Bohemian Rhapsody made for promising signs of it being a hit. Bohemian Rhapsody, despite its success, certainly has its very vocal detractors who despised the director and hated how the film depicted Freddie's sexuality by either straightwashing him or depicting it in a way people found grossly offensive. It seems unlikely similar criticism would be aimed at Rocketman because it is one of the very few mainstream Hollywood productions to feature gay sex. Rocketman's higher rating allow it to be more explicit allowing it to provide at least some of the action that alluded the Queen biopic.As fun as Bohemian Rhapsody was it's not easy to argue its merits as a great movie. It played itself as more of a collection of Queen's greatest hits and was so bereft of ideas that it featured almost the entirety of the band's performance at Live Aid. Rocketman doesn't feature a 20-minute sequence you can find on Youtube and instead attempts to subvert some of the tropes of a musical biopic by smartly tying in the most famous Elton John songs into the themes and narrative of the film. It plays as a biopic, and a musical-fantasy as the timing of the musical numbers match the events of the story. Take for example, Elton's I'm Still Standing which follows his return from the brink of destruction from drink and drugs. Director Dexter Fletcher's (who also worked on Bohemian Rhapsody) creativity and lighthearted take on the material helps the eye-popping, fantastical elements have an extravagant visual appeal (the colours are worthy of the man himself) and bring something refreshing to a tired genre.Taron Egerton is marvellous as Elton John, playing him at his elaborate highs and terrible lows perfectly, and whilst he doesn't bear a striking resemblance to the singer, it's still an impressive performance in which he does his own singing. Having performed I'm Still Standing in Sing, Egerton already had the relevant experience to take on a role he really makes his own. Elton's friendship with Bernie (Jamie Bell) is moving, and his toxic relationship with John Reid (Richard Madden) elicits sympathy for man taken advantage of. The film follows a typical biopic tale, but the central point of the narrative is an AA meeting which utilises flashback as a story telling device (starting at his childhood) thereby giving us a feeling that Elton is reflecting on his past life, especially his regrets and feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing.Elton John was closely involved in the production of Rocketman so it was never going be an entirely warts and all depiction yet it does depict his slide into a life of drugs and the struggles of his personal life. It's certainly not a rose tined picture of his life, however, the drug addiction and sex fuelled orgies feels a little underdeveloped (it does depict it impressively in song, but it never felt as though there was a reliance on drugs) as the film focuses on his incredible stage presence and insecurities. It does feel like a conventional biopic (the middle sags a little) even if the way Elton's songs are shown in the movie subvert some the clichés and make it feel more than just a montage of Elton John's greatest hits.",Rocketman

Although not my favourite format in the half biopic, half story musical - Rocketman seemed to balance it fairly well to keep me entertained with a lack of the 'eye roll' effect.Where it falls short and starts to roll into less successful film territory for me were the AA scenes, in which Elton tells the audience exactly what was going on, it felt a bit typical for me. I want to be shown, not explained.Some scenes felt like a mindlessly self indulgent attempt to tug at audiences heart strings.

1. I didn't like that the movie was basically a musical instead of a biopic.
2. With a few exceptions, I disliked the arrangements of the songs. Why change perfection? The songs should have been presented as Elton recorded them.

He completely excelled in playing Elton and his acting and voice were phenomenal. The emotion he was able to portray throughout gave substance and depth to the movie and there were times I got quite chocked up in learning of just how tough Elton's childhood and adulthood was.I am not that familiar with all of Elton's earlier material but have loved his music especially what he writes for Disney for years and his lyrics never cease to amaze me. This musical gave me a new found respect for Elton not just as a musician but as a person who has come from humble beginnings and had to be true to himself despite being made to feel unloved and unworthy of the attention and credit he deserves.I was expecting something a little different in this and I guess I would have liked to have seen more on his relationships with family and others but you will certainly see enough to shed a tear and to be able to feel on a journey with Elton. Taron did an outstanding job and I wasn't sure if I enjoyed the musical more than Bohemian Rhapsody or not, I think I liked Rocketman more as it had more of an emotional affect on me. I wasn't trying to compare the two really but either way Taron deserves an Oscar. I think both movies are great in their own right for different reasons. One thing is for sure Is that after seeing this film I felt both moved and blessed to have had the privilege of having a better understanding of Elton and a glimpse into his world. Bravo guys.",Rocketman
576,Landon1620251,Easily the best musical in years.,9,13 May 2020,"There is very little wrong with this fanatical biopic. Any fears of a clean telling of Elton John's story should be put aside as he is not afraid of talking about the darker parts of his life.Before I gush on the film for several paragraphs, I thought I'd throw out my only major problem with the film. You can't really get a good grip on the passage of time. Once Reginald changes his name to Elton John (spoiler?) you don't really know how much time is passing. There are two story telling tools that kind of help. One is the montages, which are very well made and include performances that might help if you know when Elton's song were released. The other Taron's hair throughout the film. You can see that his hair thins out in the front. The problem with this is I think the hair just had two settings. Full moppy hair when he is in his twenties and thinning out like he is in his... late thirties? The rest of him doesn't look any older so that doesn't help me figure out when a scene takes place.With that out of the way though, and on the subject of Taron Egerton, he gives the best performance of his career.which is even before realizing that he actually sang all the songs in this movie; unlike a certain musical biopic that came out last year.Speaking of Bohemian Rhapsody (a film that at the time of writing I haven't finished, which is why there is no review or score for it) I am still shocked that that movie was nominated for Best Editing. Some scenes have quick edits like a Micheal Bay action sequence. The camerawork was at best uninspired...I guess what I'm trying to say is that Rocketman is a better movie in every way. This is my favorite biopic film. Not just because of the lead acting role, but also because just about every other piece of the puzzle. I look forward to seeing what the director, Dexter Fletcher, does next. This is a well shot film which shines brightest during the musical numbers. I was immediately hooked with the first scene, and how it uses the song ""The Bitch is Back.""Full credit goes to the films choreographer, Adam Murray. His only other credit is for Ready Player One. Which just makes me stop and stare at my screen. I never thought of Ready Player One for its choreography, let along think it was great. Don't know what to do with that.I could go on, like how the supporting cast is just perfect for each of their roles, or how the costume design is so good you forget that you're looking at the kid from Kingsmen and not young Elton John. This is a great film that I recommend to anyone who is a fan of Elton John, biopic films, or film musicals.",Rocketman

Mamma Mia and La La Land
With about as much reality but added misery.No need for artistic superiority in describing this as, ""What we all need to understand is, it's a beautifully depicted journey through Elton's troubled life"".It is what it is...

581,TheDude4272,Average at best,7,1 June 2019,"I thought 'Rocketman' was average at best. It seemed as though the filmmakers tried too hard to break the biopic mold by having people break out in song and dance every time they were in danger of committing the 'biopic cliche crime'. It was too distracting for me. The song/dance breaks felt like an excuse rather than a natural extension of the scene. To me, 'La La Land' is the perfect mold for how a musical should be done. The singing and dancing was used sparingly and only when the scene absolutely demanded it. Anyway, I personally felt that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a better film. It's too bad filmmakers are so beholden to the pompous critics. In bending over backwards to appease the critics, they only suck the joy out of film.",Rocketman

The main actors quite good, and believable in the role. However, the biggest problem that I have with the film is that the main actor's singing voice sounds absolutely nothing like Elton John. His voice does not go nearly as deep as Elton, and it's almost like listening to a millennial band trying to pkay what they think he sounds like. I've listen to Elton's music for over 40 years and it was quite disappointing and very distracting.

592,aaronburley-43699,Like a dream.,5,30 June 2019,"This TRUE-LIFE FANTASY by Dexter Fletcher tells the tale of a young Reggie Dwight and his journey into becoming the shining star that is Elton John.Taron Egerton plays the musician in his adult years and perfectly shows off his talent not only as as an actor but also manages to show he is a fantastic singer, showing off by performing a variety of music sung by Elton in the past. He is easily the best part of the film, demonstrating he is capable of pulling off comedy and drama while still keeping things grounded (as grounded as a man like Elton can be).The editing and cinematography fits with the way the film was intended, as a fantasy brought to life. With sweeping shots and many, many montages that show off Elton's life in intense music-driven scenes.The film is a musical, it is presented as such by having crowds of people suddenly burst into songs that don't really fit the time or the place, the film is told through the eyes and thoughs of Elton himself as he recalls events so it can often be compared to a dream (or a nightmare, which things can becoms very easily). So if you're looking for an accurate and realistic biopic on the life of Elton John then I'm afraid this isn't for you as it is far beyond that.I'll reccomend it to anyone who just wants a fun, musical style film on the dream-like life of Elton John.

It's not really the acting, which was bad. It's not really the fantasy cinematography nor the mediocre direction. If the singing were spot on, or even if they just lipsynched, all would be forgiven.

The songs is always on the wrong places.For me who love Elton John. This would be a much better movie if the character play songs in the right place, in the right time and without these silly musical number.That would be a great movie from beginning to the end.

Taron gets the singer perfectly, but Jamie Bell as Bernie provides an excellent understated foil in the background.
It probably doesn't show ALL the warts, but considering Elton was heavily involved in production, it's pretty frank, especially about his relationships with his parents.

One thing that both get right is the performances, so let's start with those.Honestly, Taron Edgerton is better than Rami Malek when it comes to leads. The main difference between the two is Taron actually sings all of the songs in the film, and he does a fantastic job. I'm guessing the reason for his casting is because of Sing where he sung I'm still standing, and honestly, I cannot thing of better casting. He had nothing wrong with his performance, just like the rest of the cast. None of the cast really did anything wrong. Their performances were great, and the singing was worth the price of admission alone.Obviously, a film has to have more than Oscar worthy acting to be fantastic, and luckily, the film delivers on everything else. The story is wonderfully told, and the script is written perfectly. The entire story is filled with so much heart and care, and told the story of Elton John in a way where you can tell the people making it actually cared about making a great movie about the story of Elton John. Also, the Cinematography! It looked great, and was very well done. However, the main thing of note when it comes to the Cinematography is the colors. The film was extremely colorful and it worked with the rest of the film perfectly.In the end, it's simply fantastic. The editing, pacing, storytelling, dialogue, script, music, and more were simply wonderful. It's a must see for any fan of Elton John, and I would recommend it for people just simply looking for a good movie. I gladly give it ten out of ten stars.

Until I saw this film. It is a rollercoaster from the opening scene, and doesn't let up. It reminded of what a fool I am. This film portrays his story in a really imaginative way, almost cartoonesque, and I loved it for that.
I preferred it to Bohemian Rhapsody. i know they are different stories, but come on, similar timelines, similar lifestyles, sex drugs and rock and roll, and released at broadly the same time.
This is a far superior piece of cinema to Bohemian Rhapsody. It reminded me of those Hollywood spectactulars from the 50s, which suits the tale.

609,FilmLion,Enjoyability of this film is directly tied to your fan level for Elton John,2,22 September 2019,"While clear from the first few minutes of this film that the creative forces behind it wanted to make sure they weren't making a "" standard biopic"", a little of that could have really enhanced this movie. By wanting to stay away from becoming a standard biopic, some of the smaller, yet important characters ( such as Elton John's parents) in this movie were never developed beyond being little more than cardboard cutouts. Perhaps developing these characters more would have shined more light onto where EJ's quirks and behaviors came from and would have given this movie more depth. This would also make the viewer care more about the main character. The way Elton John is portrayed here makes it difficult for the viewer to care about what he went through.However, Taron Egerton's performance should be nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar. His performance was really the glue that held this movie together, since it jumps around in time a lot. This movie seems to pay no attention to the chronological timeline in which EJ's songs were written or released.The cinematography, sets, costumes, etc were fantastic and well done throughout the entire film.Many of Elton John's hardcore, lifelong fans will love this movie, but many of his hardcore, lifelong fans will also not. Those who are not huge Elton John fans would most likely find this movie tortuous to sit through.Since this film is more a mashup of fantasy musical numbers than a biopic, I guess it isn't fair to compare it to others, although it was marketed as such. However, I realize that although I saw this movie only a week ago on DVD, i still remember more details and care more about the main characters in the biopics La Bamba (1987) or Sweet Dreams (1983) that I watched over 30 years ago than I do about Rocketman! It might be more fair to compare it to last year's Bohemian Rhapsody: when you do, there is still no comparison.In an effort to be "" not your standard biopic"" , the filmmakers have delivered a movie that is a collection of fantasy musical numbers and scenes that makes watching it more like work than an entertaining, enlightening, or interesting experience.In summary, Rocketman fails to launch.",Rocketman

That was probably cathartic, but still painful.My wife loved it, I was of the ""take it our leave it"" mindset.The costuming was FANTASTIC, better than the original outfits. I was surprised that an extended sequence used the song Pinball Wizard by the Who, instead of some other piece by EJ. Yes, I am fully aware of EJ's role in Tommy.

This film was so much more than I was anticipating. Interchanging between huge musical numbers and emotional story beats, I have a newfound appreciation for Elton John, his music, and Taron Egerton as a leading actor. I will admit that I teared up multiple times throughout the film and I might have cried if I was watching it on my own.This certainly isn't a film for everyone and I would not recommend it be viewed casually. This film is a lot but all of it is interesting and worthwhile for people who appreciate music or music history.

After Bohemian Rhapsody, if this movie doesnt win awards hand over fist its a crime because Rocketman is better in every way! The only reason this is not a 10 is there is a slight musical element. (That is a few scenes where the actors seem to be directed by the music) which kind of broke the flow for me personally.

The absence of Long John Baldry, who Elton really got the John from, was noticeable; as was the story of him befriending Ryan White. For anyone who doesn't know that segment of the EJ life, a young straight boy got AIDS in the early 1980s when nobody really knew what it was. Fear was everywhere. Ryan was shunned at school and everywhere he went as people feared his very presence would give them AIDS. As he began dying of the disease, his mother approached Elton John, Ryan's favorite singer. EJ came to his bedside, visited the dying boy, befriended the family, and even sang at Ryan's funeral. The event changed his life and pushed him into rehab. Not sure why that was left off, but I could see it adding to the story.Don't get me wrong, the story of Elton being a character in his own song ""Candle in the Wind"" was not lost in this movie. He was nearly pushed to death by his own fame as was Marilyn Monroe in the song. Elton lived his life like a candle in the wind as well, until he got sober and grounded. The movie perfectly portrays that and the acting was great. The story line was more realistic than Bohemian Rhapsody in that there were very few flaws shown about Freddie Mercury, yet Elton seems more human in Rocketman instead of just a musical prodigy turned rock icon.It is a musical however, and scenes suddenly burst into song. Because they are Elton songs, they are not sung as well by the actors but they somehow fit the movie just fine the way they are. Great movie.",Rocketman
626,erinjanedalrymple,Uncomfortable to watch.,2,3 May 2020,"I had high hopes for this movie. The music and casting were great, but they way it was filmed was awful. If it had been done like a biopic, then it would have been better. This 'musical journey' experience cheapened the story and reminded me a lot of High School Musical. The random dancing also just gave me secondhand embarrassment.",Rocketman
627,mclartyd,Be entertained and enlightened,9,14 June 2019,Great acting and the life of a great musician with all the facts laid bare. Excellent cast and a new slant on storytelling interspersed with the wonderful music so many of us have grown up with.,Rocketman
628,frucklish,"Hard to finish, easy to dismiss",3,8 May 2020,"Going into Rocketman, I expected a heartfelt, poignant, and ultimately uplifting portrait of the life of a gay icon whose musical prowess restructured pop music forever and gifted us with some of the most ubiquitous hits of the 20th century. Instead, I was presented with nearly two hours of Taron Egerton humming his way through the classics, trying desperately to evoke the whimsical stylings of Elton John but coming up short every single time.""Rocketman"" is poised to convince us that Elton John is more than just the man behind the eccentric costumes and otherworldly performances. Instead, Dexter Fletcher takes Elton's image and frames it to be palatable. He takes the bits and pieces of his life that would best fit into a typical biopic, crams them into two hours, and portrays his life in the most cliched, corny fashion possible.The story is by-the-books: the child prodigy in an unloving home, the ""partner-in-crime"" character, the meteoric rise to stardom, the nervous first performance, the abusive partner, the spiral into madness and drugs, the rising from the ashes. You could have told me this was a parody of a biopic and I wouldn't have questioned you for a second. There is practically nothing to differentiate this film from the hundreds of biopics about assorted famous people to be made in the past half-century, which is even more unfortunate when you consider just how unique an individual Elton John is.Speaking of which, Taron Egerton's characterization may be passionate, but it's also overacted to the point where I cringed whenever I saw him getting ""emotional"" again. I know Elton John was dramatic, but could we go five minutes without him yelling, crying, beaming, moping? Was there no room for nuance?I would talk about the other characters in the film a bit more, but since the film doesn't care about them, the audience shouldn't either. Their only utility is to provide Elton further purpose in his life and career, and in the context of the movie, these people can be one of two things: helpers or hindrances. The most dynamic characters switch from one to the other, but it rarely goes much deeper than that. This becomes abundantly clear towards the movie's closing scene, when Elton sees the ""spirits"" of his loved ones and colleagues, as if they were demons and angels sent to him and him only, and confronts or thanks them one-by-one. They each say one or two lines that defines their entire role in the movie, and then Elton quickly shoots each of them down with a ""Gotcha!"" moment. Should we be concerned that these are real people with real stories and real personalities watered down to fit neatly into painfully archetypal roles within Elton's life? Is it odd that he has one final, supposedly cathartic moment where he strips their characters down to their barest elements and reveals just how simple their portrayals in the movie are? I thought it was, but maybe I shouldn't have. After all, this is ELTON'S movie, not Bernie's or anyone else's, so why should they be fleshed out? ...right?The music also bears mentioning, of course, since it IS a musical. I kept hoping that this would be the film's saving grace, but I was sorely mistaken. Most jukebox musicals, especially ones that span an artist's whole career, have some self-awareness and recognize that it's impossible to string together an entire discography of loosely-related singles and expect a fully realized portrait of an artist's life to come together in the process. (Clearly, Dexter Fletcher didn't get the memo.) These types of musicals instead allow for the story to progress for some amount of time before hitting us with another musical number, and build the story around the songs rather than with them. By not inundating the audience with performances, they allow for everyone to get a feel for the narrative outside of the songs and to take a breath in between. ""Rocketman"" seems intent on suffocating moviegoers.This math is probably flawed (as most math is) but the film's soundtrack album is about 1 hour and 13 minutes long. Compare that number to the runtime of the movie (2 hours and 1 minute) and it means that more than 60% of the movie is just music. On top of that, Taron Egerton is certainly no Pavarotti, let alone Elton John. While he's shown himself to be a competent vocalist in the past, and he has a similar timbre to his voice as Elton, it's evident that vocally, there's no real comparison. The passion, the soulfulness, it's all stripped away to be more to the film's liking. Worse yet is the processing on the vocals, which borders on T-Pain levels, and renders the music absolutely lifeless.Regardless of who's singing, though, the bottom line is that it doesn't feel like I'm actually watching an accurate approximation of someone's life story when their story feels secondary to the music, especially when plot points show up and disappear simply for the sake of being able to include a certain song. The ""Tiny Dancer"" scene, where Elton seems jaded after seeing Bernie getting with a woman, makes barely any sense before it happens and just as much sense afterwards. A few scenes before (or after, not really sure) Elton makes a move on Bernie, and Bernie rejects his advances. Elton doesn't seem too distraught over it, and this is the only other time this idea of any unrequited love between the two of them comes up in the entire movie, so why include that as a part of the story in the first place? And if that's not what we're meant to glean from this scene, then why use a song like ""Tiny Dancer""?All in all, please don't make me watch this movie again, Dad.",Rocketman
629,AndyMahooney,Too Much Razzle Dazzle,7,4 June 2019,"Something in me yearns to connect with Elton John; he seems like a totally nice guy. And Egerton portrays his outbursts and saddening addictions very thoughtfully. But there's something to be desired of this spectacle. Interesting dynamics involving family issues and personal life get glossed over too frequently in exchange for the grand splendor of musical performance.As a precocious child, Elton eases his way into a prestigious music academy and then we get a musical number to launch us into his young adult years. At the pinnacle and turning point of his career, he is nervous to perform in front of a packed house. Members which include a few of the Beach Boys and we are told earlier that ""Neil Young was here last week."" We relate to his fears and sympathize with the possibility of screwing up big time. The pressure is tangible and it's a great moment when he casts it aside and starts belting out some tunes. He becomes a star.His life becomes superfluous and carefree. It seems too good to be true. Then it is. ""It is a shame, choosing the route where you will get no true love."" His mother's words after his confession as a homosexual. Their relationship seems arbitrary and strange, while the father completely insults and disowns him. When his mother says this, his manager and lover also detaches, and then Elton disconnects with his world and falls into dismay. This world full of music, always a part of him, now forced in his face and he gets quite lonely. Do the drugs and alcohol fuel a sulking to feed into his loner profile? Does it feel good to cast aside everyone, declaring himself one of a kind? Is he creating a problem to have some fun? Maybe this was all too easy for him. When the thirst for success dwindles, and there is no one to connect with, you will turn to drugs and alcohol.And then it gets strange. When a metaphor in film works, it is like a light bulb in the head and resounds human emotions. A feeling of connection to the author and viewer. But we are fed so many and such big stage shows, we have whiplash. Someone mentioned here that this is what the film is: a musical displaying and not telling of his life. A film is visual medium and will be treated with some eye candy. But as humans, and this being a biopic, more thought could have gone a long long way into building tension so those extravagant scenes held more meaning, more truthfulness. Blasting him into space with rockets attached to his feet literally made me wince and I felt I needed some air. Perhaps a simple conversation would have sufficed.",Rocketman
630,kelleneisner,Wow,10,5 June 2019,"Best movie of the year (so far). The movie makes the perfect choice to flip the genre of musical biopics on its head. The film does go the way you would expect it... but it is still very fresh. The direction choice of making the movie a full on musical was great. The movie was a blast because of it. This film is not safe, it takes risks... especially with the musical aspect to the film. But of course, the musical serves a purpose, as the movie perfectly captures what every musical biopic should do. Capture the musicians life, which means capturing the full highs, and the full lows with confidence. Without that your film would feel fake. But Rocketman never feels fake. It is incredibly risky and confident. I loved every moment of it.

Rhapsody was good but this squishes it.The soundtrack is phenomenal. Taron has such an incredible voice and all the songs are done beautifully. Go check it out right now. But listen to the Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with just Taron.The music timeline is messed up, and Elton and John Reid relationship is toxic but this movie is a masterpiece and one final thing!Give an Oscar to this movie, give an Oscar to Taron, Give an Oscar to the Soundtrack!

Like many other reviewers I wasn't aware that it was a musical, but it was apparent very quickly. It felt as though Taron Egerton put his heart and soul into this role and it definitely should be rewarded. Jamie Bell was also so real in his performance. Honestly, I think those who may not have had positive reviews may have had discomfort in the sex scenes. Again, there was no holding back from Taron. I thought he was pretty awesome in the first Kingsman film and he has shown such a maturity and depth of understanding of this role (and he's only 29!) that it really blew me away.

The urge to sing along at all. They made the huge mistake of NOT overdubbing Elton John's voice and went with the actors average voice. You still may want to sing along so they changed the composition of the music enough to drain the inspiration out of the song. Lastly the songs seem to end suddenly so like a bad comic who keeps stepping on the laughs you end up refraining from getting committed to the song. Nope. They ruined the experience.

Dallas Bryce Howard played his mother and of course she always plays a bad character because she was a b***h as the mother who could care less about Elton (broken heart when I see/hear what she says to Elton in the film) and yet she did a good job and nailed the British accent. John Reid, just, wow. Anyways, movie is fantastic and do not compare it to Bohemian Rhapsody because they're completely separate films, which I love both so much.

But, stay away if you're not a fan of themOne aspect I disliked was that too many scenes start in one ""area,"" then the singing/song starts, then they resolve the song into a different ""area"". Also, I can't recall a single song lasting more than a minute or so, at best. You more-less get snippets of a lot Elton's songs, with the occasional symbolism added to some of them. What's unfortunate, in my opinion, is that some of his hits aren't at all played like the real songs themselvesIn regards to the acting, it was decent. There are some emotional scenes which were filmed quite effective, but, nothing that'll leave you sobbing.

Some may have known more about Eltons past and his demons than others, as for me I was heartbroken by his early story and happy to know he found joy and self love later in life.

I was ready to enjoy a biopic style movie with Elton John's music depicted in a way as to be enjoyed for the music, not for the huge musical style dance number that went with it.
In one scene, a young Elton tells a man to take his drink off the piano as ""it'll get knocked off."" He then plays a few bars (har har) on the piano then takes part in the dance montage around him. Really, Reginald? Is that exactly how it happened?
It's cinematic choices like this that make this movie less than what it could have been. Why couldn't we enjoy a young Reg' Dwight playing the piano and the crowd in the pub reacting to it?

Second, the film took a look over the life of Elton John, not in depth but in surrealistic point of view, where fantasy and reality are not separated.What I learned about Elton is what I already knew. That he is homosexual, that his parents are over - exaggeratedly psychotic, that he has been neglected as a child seeking approval,that he had a drug problem and that he made alot of money from his music. We saw an overly explicit sex scene with him.
What i was interested about his life was, how he made his most iconic songs, when and why was he knighted , his song for Lady Diana, his marrige and now children. The scene when he was getting married to a famale collegue of his, was rushed, and was not explained properly. He was married to Renate Blauel for 4 years, and we had 2 scenes about that marrige.

666,jackcatman,Reimagined history,5,25 August 2019,"As a fan of Elton John and lover of musicals, this seemed right up my street. But the film falls flat from the start.
The songs are muddled in order and the facts drastically changed to suit the story - Elton's dad is made into the bad guy, the manager into a fool, and relationships are invented or ignored. Far from a candid look back on his past, Rocketman sees Elton reimagining his life.
The plot is thin, the dance routines over the top, and the songs sqeezed in an attempt to compliment the story.
Whilst Queen's recent biopic 'Bohemian Rapsody' packed a punch, this left me bored and unmoved. More like a long episode of Glee than a proper film.
The problem may be down to the lyrics, in that they're not Elton's, they're Bernie's. Elton plays the piano and sings, but the words aren't his. Therefore, using them to tell his story doesn't really work.
Recently I saw 'Blinded By The Light', the film based on Bruce Spingsteen songs; it is far superior because the songs matched the story, and the story itself was moving and character driven.

This is the movie.

668,pommy1,"Elton John 1, Moviegoers 0",6,12 January 2020,"I enjoyed so much of this and yet, as the titles came down, the overriding feeling I had was frustration.
Sure, Taron Egerton deserves an Oscar - I only found out afterwards that he'd done all the singing himself, which makes his performance even more remarkable. I didn't enjoy the dance scenes, though - but maybe that's me. I just feel this is such a good story, just tell it without the distractions.
What really got to me, though, was that every one of EJ's tantrums was conveyed with a powerful sense of sympathy, justified by a tough childhood and unsupportive parents.
The sneaking suspicion I had that EJ himself had had a hand in this was confirmed when I saw that the musician himself had been its executive producer. Subjects of biopics often decide to have nothing to do with it. EJ decided the opposite and cannily went on to preserve his reputation as a ""difficult darling"" and nothing more. The closing text, which glorified his contribution to charitable causes and sought to emphasise what a remarkable human being he is and how lucky we are to have him, only served to confirm that he had won the battle to portray himself in the best possible light.",Rocketman

670,eileenpa,A musical biopic with all the highs and lows,9,3 June 2019,"I had heard going in that this movie was closer to a musical in some respects than a biopic with music - which is accurate. It would translate beautifully onto Broadway. That said, my ratings:Acting: 10/10 - Taron Edgerton nails Elton John. I was a tween when Elton first hit the US, and was obsessed with his music from that point on, being a pianist. He absolutely dominated the 1970s, and Taron portrays the ups and down of his tortured soul while being the dominant musician of that period beautifully. Jamie Bell did an equally beautiful job with Bernie Taupin's character; he's everything I imagined he was, given how closely they worked together. I was glad to see at the end that their friendship survived this rollercoaster. The other characters did equally great jobs as well, though I would have liked to have seen how EJ's bandmates helped/hindered his ability to function throughout the 70s highs and lows. Richard Madden plays the manager/lover John Reid with an oily ice slick performance that was amazing.Music: 9/10 - I had no problem with the music being out of sync with reality, but rather driving the narrative. Since I knew all of the songs, it didn't really matter to me if they got them in letter perfect order. I was very impressed with Taron's singing ability. I'm knocking just one point off for the hard rock songs - Taron tries, but doesn't quite make some of the harder rock songs ('Saturday Night', 'Bennie and the Jets') have quite the right feel to them.Story: 7/10: I really liked the mechanism of starting and ending in rehab - to show the viewers what made EJ both drive himself and why he had vulnerabilities. However, I think they should have made the movie 15 minutes longer and shown some critical points missed in EJ's career (Paul Buckminster, Ryan White, his 'restarting' albums only with Bernie) as key points prior to rehab.Overall: 9/10: I'm giving it a 9 because it comes close to that on points. However, the storyline needed some critical points I think they cut or compressed for time. I think diehard fans like me were hoping for some scenes that never showed.",Rocketman
671,jessiejpb,"""Style"" made the ""substance"" less affecting for me..",6,31 May 2019,"*I give it 6.5/10**This is LONG. I have a lot of thoughts*To start off, I'm not much of a fan of musicals - other than a select few that I've loved since childhood. And I'm also not a fan of the fantasy genre. But I wanted to watch this and form my own opinion of it because I am a massive fan of Bohemian Rhapsody, and Rocketman has been compared to death to it, so I wanted to give it a fair chance and see what all the fuss was about. I'm going to review it in sections to make reading it a bit easier. It's very long, especially where I compare it to Bohemian. (Although I adore Bohemian, I do wish that some things were done differently, but it doesn't keep me awake at night like it clearly does for some people.)TARON: His acting was great! I found that it was even better in the second half when the storyline turned darker & more dramatic. I don't really know much about Elton John and haven't seen much archival footage of him, but from reviews, it sounds like Taron had Elton's mannerisms down and really inhabited his character. Also, I gotta say...Taron's voice is beautiful. It has an interesting quirkiness to it at times but he can also belt out when necessary.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Considering this movie is based around Elton's issues with addiction and self-hate, I felt like we didn't get to see an in depth build up of his inner turmoil. It kind of seemed rushed, like certain people treated him poorly and he was frustrated/hurt and then suddenly he was an addict. I wasn't emotionally invested in that aspect of the story, which is its core focal point. As for other characters, some were very underdeveloped and their impact on Elton didn't have much of an impact on me.SCRIPT: There were some cringy moments where I found the writing was blatantly weak/awkward.EDITING/FLOW: It made the story feel disjointed at times. Sometimes I felt like the transitions from regular scenes to musical scenes (and vice versa) were clever and flowed well, and sometimes they didn't and felt messy. This is also where some of the fantasy moments just didn't work for me.COMPARISONS TO BOHEMIAN & RAMI: 1) One thing I think is super unfair is how people are using praising Taron for doing his own singing as an opportunity to throw shade at Rami for not singing in Bohemian. First of all, Rami actually did sing. He took singing lessons and ""sang at the top of his lungs every day"" (a direct quote from him). For the people who didn't pay attention, you could see his neck and throat muscles flexing during the performance scenes. And then in the editing room they blended Freddie's voice into his with the result being mostly Freddie that came through. Second, no one can replicate Freddie Mercury's unique four-octave range, which is probably the best voice in all of rock history. Rami simply didn't have a good enough voice to pull off a convincing performance of a rock legend, whereas Taron already had the gift of a great voice BEFORE Rocketman. It's not as if he learned to sing for this movie. That was an advantage Taron had when getting this role, but it doesn't mean that Rami has now become less worthy of winning his Oscar. I've seen a lot of user & critic reviews saying ""if Rami could win an Oscar for lip-syncing then Taron is more deserving because he actually sang"". An actor's performance in a music movie is about more than just the voice. Both Rami and Taron's roles were about immersing themselves fully into the person they were portraying through mannerisms, body language, overall essence, etc. Think of it this way, if Taron sang but he didn't deliver a convincing performance in the acting department, the singing aspect wouldn't have mattered.. so the reverse can also be true and was the case for Rami...his actual voice wasn't audible to us on screen but his acting was great and he delivered a convincing performance in other ways.2) People have slammed Bohemian for having inaccuracies in timelines and facts... well Rocketman does too. Both movies took creative license in order to compress 20+ years into 2 hours. I don't get why people couldn't handle that when it came to Bohemian but can seem to overlook that for Rocketman. These movies aren't documentaries, they are products of Hollywood and the entertainment industry.3) Considering things I read in reviews about the ""level of gayness"", and its R-rating, I expected to see some pretty graphic stuff. But that just wasn't the case. I live in Canada and we have a less strict rating system here. It's been rated 14A, which is basically a step above PG-13 for Americans. There are a few scenes that had some passionate but short-lived making out, a sex scene that cut away before showing any actual sex, an oral sex scene that didn't show anything, a gay orgy musical scene, and flamboyant outfits. And Bohemian had a few make outs, a post-""one night stand"" scene, a gay club scene, a drag scene, and flamboyant outfits. The biggest difference to me is that Rocketman is intentionally very flashy, which is already a major component of the musical genre. And it's a gay musical... Of course there will be excess! And there was, but just not as much as I expected. Freddie's risqué lifestyle wasn't front and centre of Bohemian, but it was purposely made that way. Both these movies had different approaches & intentions. Bohemian focused more on Freddie as a musician, who struggled with personal issues on the side, while Rocketman focused on the inner demons that followed young Elton from childhood, right through to his journey as a musician.The fact that Elton is alive and was involved in the movie making process was an advantage for Rocketman, but Bohemian didn't have that luxury with Freddie. I think the writers of Bohemian felt a duty to Freddie to not get caught up with the exposing of his darker side (sex/drugs) but to instead preserve his legacy. He was harassed by the press for his entire career over his flamboyancy and sexuality, and he died at a time when being gay still wasn't accepted, so I think that respect factor was taken into consideration when the movie was made in terms of the level of personal life ""disclosure"" they felt was appropriate. Also, making the movie suitable for such a wide audience was a wise decision. It not only helped them rake in almost 1 billion $ but also helped get Queen's music out to every generation simultaneously. The R-rating on Rocketman is going to limit who will see it and how much money is made.4) Something I liked a lot more about Bohemian was the concert scenes. They felt more epic to me, like you were actually there in the audience or on stage with them. The concert scenes in Rocketman were really good but the fantasy sections came in too early for me. The scene where he sings Rocketman in the massive stadium was exhilarating and the kind of thing I wanted more of, and then he suddenly blasts up into the sky like a rocket and it really killed that entire scene for me. It just made me want to laugh.MUSICAL ASPECT: As I said I'm not really a fan of musicals nor fantasy, and being a fan of Bohemian and it's traditional biopic storytelling, I really wish Rocketman wasn't a musical. I would've liked to have seen Elton's story presented in a typical biopic way.CRITIC REVIEWS: Something tells me that the critics had an attitude of ""anything will be better than Bohemian Rhapsody"", so they jumped right in to praise Rocketman, and decided to ignore any flaws it has.MARKETING: I'm not quite sure why they didn't advertise this as a full musical, but my guess is they wanted to be vague in the trailers (kind of like Bohemian's trailers) in order to create enough buzz so that they could then ride on the coattails of Bohemian's financial success and the audience hunger it created for future music biopics. Not everyone likes musicals, so I think they wanted to keep the genre somewhat ""under wraps"".OSCAR POTENTIAL: I think Taron is totally deserving of an Oscar nomination, and the movie should also get nominations for costume design, cinematography, and the sound categories. Whether that happens or not and whether there are wins or not is unpredictable at this point because we're only halfway through the year and there will be a bunch more movies coming out in the next 6 months that could kick it out as a contender. Also, because it's a summer movie and not an ""awards season"" movie, the hype surrounding it may fizzle out by December/January.One scene I really loved was when Taron sang Tiny Dancer. His high notes were breathtaking! And the performance where he's dressed up in the huge puffy dress and white makeup was hilarious. There were definitely some fun, humourous scenes throughout the movie that I enjoyed.Sadly though, I felt like Rocketman didn't inspire any interest in Elton John in me. The mixture of dark and light moments, and the bipolar feel to the movie didn't help me feel uplifted or like I'd just watched a true celebration of a great artist. But I felt that way after I watched Bohemian and immediately dove headfirst into a Queen/Freddie Mercury addiction.If you're an Elton John fan, a fan of musicals, or part of the LGBTQ community, chances are you will love this movie.Although it's not my style, I can appreciate the creativity that went into telling this story, but I do think it belonged more on Broadway.I'm expecting tons of thumbs down on my review, but that's fine. I read hundreds of reviews that tore Bohemian to shreds, and while I didn't agree with them, we are all entitled to our own opinions. People need to learn to understand and accept this fact. Not everyone has to like or gravitate toward the same kinds of movies. Lastly, NEITHER movie is conclusively ""better"" than the other. Yes, they are both music biopics, but they are in vastly different genres (drama vs. musical fantasy) & use different styles of storytelling. It all comes down to personal preference and what speaks to/resonates with each individual person.",Rocketman
672,aleenator,Disappointing,3,1 June 2019,I'm a huge fan of Elton John but this movie is not a sincere biopic but rather more like a musical set to the music of Elton John in the spirit of Mama Mia or rock of Ages. Because of this it's hard to tell what's real and what's made up. You get the feeling that the story has been embellished to make the Elton character seem sympathetic rather than just pathetic.I was disappointed. Waste of time and money. I was hoping for something better.,Rocketman
673,brealz78,Was expecting more,5,7 September 2019,Aside of Taron's performance there was little to be blown away by. I was expecting more biography and less Moulan Rouge style theatrics.A solid 5/10 but can't go higher than that.,Rocketman
674,marc-577-718725,Spectacle serving the actual story in the most beautiful way,9,16 June 2019,"So it is a musical, and not a ""straight biopic"". Given that this is a story about Elton John, it probably works better that way.The film has plenty of interpersonal drama without a music score. But the musical fantasy scenes, all rearrangements of Elton John songs performed by the cast, are the heart and soul of the story. They reminded me of Moulin Rouge and also of Jesus Christ Superstar, with clever edits to flip between different timelines. The trip down memory lane along to ""The Bitch Is Back"" used colour filters to distinguish between the 1950s and the time Elton John spent in rehab. The young Reggie Dwight's fantasy of conducting an orchestra in the dark with a torchlight that he uses for secretly studying music in his bedroom is another inspired choice. Not only do these scenes fit the artist's exuberance, but they also offer possible insights in the creative processes behind the songs.Apart from this, the focus of the film is clearly on the themes of friendship, lack of self-love and redemption. The timeline including flashbacks suggests it is a well-rounded story rather than a step-by-step biopic for people to pick factual holes in. The contrast between Elton John's relationships with John Reid (sex without love) and Bernie Taupin (love but not in a sexual way) may seem a bit binary in that context, but the characters of Reid and Taupin do come across as very realistic.Elton John's parents in the film seemed very one-sided, and especially the mother just sat there looking expectantly in another direction, like she was in a film of her own. For me, though, this was more than compensated by scenes with Elton and Bernie Taupin, as well as so many others.",Rocketman

I found the portrayal of John Reid puzzling as, in Rocketman, he is a very unpleasant character which, in BoRhap, he is not. As another reviewer rightly points out, this is a film blaming all and sundry for anything bad that happened in EJ's life - a 'poor me' element which tainted the film.

683,marklin-21812,Grand Pretentious Bio Cliche of the Year,5,1 July 2019,"Hmmmm, very scattered, unfathomable and pretentious fragmented film in epic identity crisis. Under the shadow of Bohemian Rhapsody there seems to be a onslaught of bio pics and musicals coming through theaters. This film is problematic from the get go as it tries to figure out whether it's a bio pic about Elton John, the human rock star, or a grandiose spectacle to proclaim admiration and worship of Elton John the unfathomable rock god.
There are some good takeaways, some flashy sparkly cinematic tricks and musical dance choreography but the story gets lost. The whole film gets lost like one long song pieced together by songs we recognize and love but ultimately it's song without a hook. Without spoiling the film, a big show at the Troubadour is not American bandstand or BBC. I mean, really? This should be one film or another. I don't feel like I know anymore about Elton John than I did walking into the film except that he didn't write any of the songs, unlike Mercury. However, if your a junky for cover band shows or karaoke then I should just shut now, but if you're like me hearing someone sing Elton's songs like an amateur was all the fuel I needed to leave the film early. I'll go home and read his Wikipedia while I listen to his albums. My imagination is better than this half musical/ half bio pic fail. I predict 6-6.5 stars by the time it hits streaming.",Rocketman

Didnt like the musical aspect though im sure Elton did, I mean how else would we expect to see elton john's life. But often it gets too much and often feels like they are just trying to skip over the important bits of his childhood. In some parts, the theatrical and musical aspects work very well while in some parts it feels like a diversion.
If u watch this movie, watch it for Taron Egerton. He has come a loooooong long way from kingsman. Otherwise try your best to ignore the overtop spectacle that attempts to match the spectacle of elton john but goes way over top like micheal bay special effects. The emotional aspects are soppy, weak n feel rushed only helped by Taron Egerton's performance. Its like they just wanna get over it like we're in rehab and being lied to by the movie.

688,thomasjkieran,Worth the watch,6,19 May 2019,"Let me first start off with saying I'm not an Elton John fan. Let's start with the two biggest flaws of the film. First of all, they did a great job doing any character development of Elton John so it was hard to connect with the actors as he was going through the tough times. And secondly, the storyline was weak and didn't flow very well it seemed to be more of a tribute film / glorified documentary.What I think was brilliant about the film. The cinematography was gorgeous in a dark kind of way. The transitions from scene to scene were pretty amazing like when Elton turns into a rocket and then blows up into a firework only to end up landing on his own plane and his hair smoking. The dancing in the film was well choreographed.Overall the movie was entertaining however, it's a movie I only need to see once.",Rocketman

The movie never touches on his philanthropy, or the fact that he quit touring to raise children. It also fails to acknowledge that his life long contributions to music and to England has resulted in his Knighthood. Sir Elton John deserves better than this movie. It appears the Casting Director found it too difficult to pick an English actor that could sing the songs, so instead, we have ""Reader's Digest"" condensed versions or people other than the leading man singing the songs.

704,Siena16,A riveting combination of candor and glamor!,8,15 June 2019,"It is always unfair to compare one movie to another; however in the stream of recently popularized biopics about music icons, it is impossible not to yield into the urge. Both Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman were built base on legends imprinted on me from early childhood, thus it only took me a second to decide to watch this movie in theater alone. And this time i am in utter bafflement at the candid depiction of such a renown figure in modern times.
Unlike the overly- romanticised version of Freddie Mercury, Rocketman feels more like a drama than anything else. Albeit some minor plot holes, cliche, and of course the unavoidable exaggerations that always inserted themselves in these types of film, it still demonstrates the struggle, sufferings, and inner- conflicts of a lost, heart- broken, forsaken and lonely person who also battles with identity- crisis. I found myself not shedding a tear even once during the entire time watching this, yet my heart grew heavier and more despondent every time Taron Egerton used his magnificent talents to open the closed door, allowing me to have a peek to what's behind the sparkling costumes and cheering stage. It is a very very personal and relatable movie to me. I wholeheartedly enjoy it, not because it was about someone who i grew up with (the sole reason why I enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody, the music and the talent of Freddie Mercury), but the lingering feelings it leaves long after I left the theater.",Rocketman

I was so very wrong. Every cast member was spot on. The cinematography grand, locations top notch, the sets for auditions & recording studios & club scenes & band chatter & more are all ace! The L.A. Street scenes very well done. There's so much nuance, spark & yep, realism, in this, it's stunning. I had grace to work in 'the industry' '90s. > '00s. Doug Weston was pleasant & kind to this novice first time we met. I looked forward to seeing him even if it was a quick hello/goodbye. A fount of knowledge ~ not only of music but much much more ~ had an opinion of most everything &, whether agreed or disagreed, logical reason to support it. Jovial, daft sweetie who often treated me as a friend. I witnessed his bad side, & man, he was really good at that too. I can't compliment the writers or Tate Donovan enough as I think they got Doug right. I imagine Elton Johns input a great part of that. Viewing the film again just now reminds me how sad it is Doug's gone. I'm glad more folks have a wee idea how much of a resource he was, how Doug Weston & his Troubadour really were the start of finally having a larger audience, the US beginning for so many artists & how it was THE place that artists went to to hear other artists. Still is, though Rocketman definitely is during the hottest time. Absolutely a film for anyone who loves Elton, rock music history as many artists ~ even now ~ can relate to much here even if as a dream to come with some things to avoid, a musical where all cast & the numerous other singers & dancers are bright.

Not those scenes involving his parents, as they never register as anything more than cardboard cutouts of real human beings, but the few scenes involving his grandmother. She was apparently the only adult in his family who showed him genuine love in his childhood, and the director manages to convey this well in the short amount of time allotted to this minor (but not so minor) character.It is all downhill from then on.There are three colossal problems with this movie. The first is the lack of any adherence to the basic chronological facts of Elton John's musical career. You do not need to be a hardcore fan of his to know, or at least suspect, that John did not play ""Crocodile Rock"" at his opening gig in L.A., because that is a song that did not even exist in 1970, and wouldn't see release until the mid 70's. Similarly absurd is the scene in Dick James' office, well before John was even known in the music world, during which he rattles off the first few seconds of many recognizable songs that would later be major hits. Most notable among them is ""I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues""-a song that would not be released until 1983, nearly 15 years later. I realize this is supposed to be something of a musical ""fantasy"" and that I am supposed to ""suspend my disbelief."" Maybe I would have if the other elements of this movie covered into a satisfying whole. But they don't. Not even close.The second major problem is the narrative concept of John telling the whole story of his life in rehab, during a group therapy session. Thus, the movie is one flashback after another.
First, it is beyond stupid and actually insulting to think that we're supposed to believe something like this would actually happen. This is not how group therapy works-anywhere, for anyone, no matter how famous you are. For the whole movie, none of the ten or so other patients gets to say a damn thing. They just sit there and listen to the world famous, filthy rich Elton John moan about his supposedly awful life. Oh wait, the leader of the group therapy session gets to ask a few questions. Sorry. To make this situation even less realistic, John is alternately dressed in a ridiculous devil-with-wings costume, or simply in a bathrobe, naked underneath, wearing big glasses with pink glitter on the rims. Give me a break. Even if you have never spent time in rehab, you can see that none of this would fly in such a setting. People take turns talking. No one gets to hog the floor. It's as if the screenwriter and director knew nothing, absolutely nothing at all about addiction treatment. It's been a while since I have witnessed such a massive display of ignorance and stupidity on display in a major Hollywood production-and one that's gotten largely decent reviews, for God's sake.Finally, and worst of all, is a flaw common to the majority of biopics-the period of time covered is too great, there is too much territory to cover, and so the result is that the majority of the film feels like a summary of the subject's life. When will these people learn that less is more? Why do you need to cram so much into so little time? Even though the movie is two hours long, the cramming ""effect"" still leads to patently absurd sequences such as John's ill fated marriage to a German recording engineer in the mid 80's. He meets her for the first time (apparently), they get married, and then they get divorced-all of this in the space of no more than 3 or 4 minutes. Renate Blauel, his wife for 4 years, is granted only 3 or 4 lines, all of them brief.The last flaw above all is what kills so many biopics. This is why this genre is so aggressively, predictably mediocre, 9 times out of 10. ""Rocketman"" is worse than mediocre, however. It is a genuinely awful film, and worse, an awful film that has received a bizarre amount of enthusiastic praise from fans and critics, who are paid to know better, alike.If this movie is superior to its 2019 counterpart ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", as so many have claimed,  On the other hand, I do not think I can trust in that claim if its source is someone who believes Rocketman is an example of good filmmaking. Regardless, I've had my fill of rock star biopics.My advice to other directors who take it upon themselves to tell the life story of so and so rockstar: don't tell their life story. Don't make a biopic. Focus on a year or two in their lives, or even a month, week, or single day. Give yourself time to flesh out the characters, to bring them to LIFE. Fast forwarding through a decade or more inevitably lends your story a ""greatest hits"" sort of feeling.",Rocketman
710,gordongriffiths69,Stratospheric,10,23 May 2019,Truly fantastic biography of one of the true legends and icons of rock and roll. Taron Everton Oscar winning performance. You have to see this film. The best film of the year,Rocketman

714,steve-09684,Uneven at best . . .,5,31 May 2019,"Uneven is the kindest verdict I can give to Rocketman. There are a three or four brilliant scenes where the film absolutely sparkles. And there are 30 or 40 other scenes where it slogs along clumsily and overwrought. And shockingly, the film runs completely out of storyline at least 40 minutes before it finally ends. The filmmakers desperately try to fill this extra time with endless scenes of poor Elton feeling so sad and misunderstood that only drugs and self-pity can help. And he takes ample doses of both . . . over and over . . . to the point where you will begin to roll your eyes and lose interest.But do not despair, the movie eventually comes to an end. And when it does, you are immediately greeted by an onscreen newsflash notifying you that Elton is now sober! And what a relief you'll feel - like a double-dose of good news! Not only is Elton okay but this mess of a movie is finally over!The music is good but you knew that going in. (It's Elton John for god's sake.) There are a couple of fantastic magical-realism scenes. (Concert at The Troubadour; suicide vision at the bottom of the pool). And there are some interesting coming-of-age, discovering-musical-genius scenes. But the vast majority of the film is insufferable whimpering: ""mommy doesn't love me; daddy's so mean; no-one understands me; and you don't like me 'cuz I'm gay."" All of that may be true - but none of it is as offensive as having to pay 12 bucks and sit through 2 hours of this steaming pile of self-pity.",Rocketman
715,MorakFR,Could have been better,5,7 June 2019,"I'm quite disappointed with this movie after watching Bohemian Rhapsody.The musical comedy was wrongly done. Lack of vibrations on several musics. Multiple boring moments.I'm half cold half warm by this movie.Actors were okay. Taron was not absolutely brilliant, but he was great indeed (it's normal I guess, as there are many ""theatral/overplayed"" scenes).Overall, the movie could have been much better.",Rocketman
716,e-pepper,Melodramatic,3,17 May 2020,"It plays like a stage performance where actors are sometimes more melodramatic because of the setting.

719,patuttis,"In my opinion, the perfect movie.",10,9 June 2019,"This movie deserves every award nomination it could possibly get. The film is so amazing and is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Taron gives a breathtaking performance as Elton John with his real, stunning vocals and didn't fail to make me feel so many emotions. The casting is amazing, especially with the younger versions of Elton. Child actors usually aren't at the level of adult actors, but the kids really knocked it out of the park. And of course, so did everyone else. I see people saying they didn't like the musicals aspect of the movie, but I thought it just enhanced the fantasy. And people need to stop comparing it to Bohemian Rhapsody in their reviews. You're supposed to be reviewing the movie itself, not comparing it to others.",Rocketman
720,info-77430,Predictable high school musical,4,11 July 2019,"Basically it's a predictable musical without any originality. Not with all the alcohol or drugs his life was interesting enough to make a movie about.

I wasn't expecting so much, especially after the sycophantic disaster that was Bohemian Rhapsody, but what a pleasant surprise Rocketman was. I enjoyed every minute of it. Beautifully conceived with originality galore, passionately written with Truth all over the place, and exquisitely acted by all. Bravo. First really good movie I've seen in 2019. I will be seeing it again with anyone I can drag along.",Rocketman

723,edusting,Inspiration film making.,8,8 July 2019,"I loved this film and would happily watch it again. The screenplay is original and bares Elton's downfall in such a poignant way. We get a glimpse into the intimacy of his domestic situation. We witness the harm that having distant parents can do to a child's self esteem. The fact that he is alive today is a miracle and thank goodness for rehab. The scene when he talks to his younger self had me in tears. The disregard in which his management hold him is depicted as, after a suicide attempt, they simply fix him up and get him back on stage as quickly as possible. It made me sad for artists such as Amy Winehouse - have we learned nothing?",Rocketman
724,sshostings,Only got half way through the movie,1,10 August 2019,This movie is 90% singing. There is very little talking. I thought they would do this movie a little more like straight out of Compton or bohemian rhapsody.,Rocketman

729,splus-40375,Rocketman is better than Bohemian Rhapsody?,8,8 June 2019,"Well, Rocketman is a film that surpasses Bohemian Rhapsody in some ways, but it's a very incomplete film, perhaps for the reason that Elton John is still alive and the producers can not get a full story. The film did one thing that Bohemian Rhapsody did not: Focus more on Elton John's personal life. If the film Bohemian Rhapsody had not made that mistake, I think it would be a lot better and more interesting than it already is. Another issue in this film is that it is a musical, not a serious biography like Bohemian Rhapsody. Overall I give a score of 8 due to the incomplete movie problem but otherwise a great movie.",Rocketman

This is NOT like Bohemian Rhapsody AT ALL. That movie, about Queen, had a lot of Queen music. This is like paying money to see an Elton tribute band when you think you're seeing Elton. ZERO music is performed from Elton's archives and dubbed. It is all Taron Egerton. He's talented. His acting was amazing. But I wanted to HEAR ELTON HERCULES JOHN because that is who the movie is about! So, just prepare to see a tribute to Elton and maybe you'll be less disappointed than I was.",Rocketman

Editing was amazing. Taron egerton was a great choice because of the similarity but also because he was great at the acting. That you actually feel really bad for him. And the ending was such a great way to... well end. I loved it,Rocketman
735,kwlistowel,AMAZING,10,22 July 2020,Taron outdid himself in the role of Elton Hercules John. The movie was flawless it was perfection. It did a great job explaining Eltons life minus a few inaccuracies on some facts of his life that they let out but overall its an outstanding movie.,Rocketman
736,flokampfer-00288,What a poor guy,9,6 April 2021,"A great movie, but definitely not a feelgood movie. The poor man had to go through a lot, and his parents are just disgusting and misanthropic. I have rarely felt so much hatred for fictional characters as I do for these wayward people. That said, I have the greatest respect for the fact that Elton has become a superstar in spite of these parents. I was never aware that Elton based his lyrics on reality. That makes the songs appear in a completely different light.",Rocketman
737,bigjdog-77967,10 out of 10 movie,10,31 March 2021,This movie is an emotional rollercoaster. It follows Elton johns darkest moments and some of his happiest. It also has one of the best soundtrack and cast in my opinion.,Rocketman

A biopic is the wrong genre to force a musical down people's throats. This movie was so bad that I had to send the dog to bed early. 20 minutes flat is as far as we got...I've lost respect for Elton John as a human being for not publicly condemning this cinematic puddle of horse semen. Semper Fi.",Rocketman
739,sistinam,Brilliant in every way!,10,26 May 2019,"This film touched me. I am not a fan of musicals but this was not a musical as you might imagine a musical to be. It think it was brilliant in every way, the acting, the story, the entertainment factor and of course the music. I think this movie is also a testament to the fact that a child needs much more than to just be fed and educated by parents, a child needs to feel loved and cherished. It shows you how all the success and money in the world still cannot make you happy if you feel unloved.",Rocketman

750,mommysgurl_777,Bohemian Rhapsody meets Across the Universe,3,3 June 2019,"Before I start, let me get out the positives:
Acting- Taron Egerton gives a fantastic performance as Elton John. You can really see that he took this opportunity to play a legendary performer and gave it his all. You can see his passion throughout his entire performance. The other actors in the film are all fine, doing a really good job, none stood out as bad or not up to par.
Costumes- simply stunning. Captured Elton's eccentricity to a T, and the design overall was extremely pleasing.
Singing & Dancing- Taron is an extremely talented singer, and it really showcases in this. The choreography is also amazing, the dancing was great, no complaints there.Now on to the negative.Let me start this part off by saying I am an avid fan of musicals and musical theater. I absolutely adore them. But I have to say, for the first time maybe ever, the singing and musical numbers just didn't make sense to me, mostly because the lyrics had little to nothing to do with what was happening onscreen. Likely, was due to them not being written to be performed as a musical, and they were instead sort of stuck in whatever place in the story they might have worked best.
Another movie that did the same thing, but it worked for them was 2007's Across The Universe, which was written in a very similar fantastical style as Rocketman. The reason, though that those songs seemed to fit more into the story was that they were, many of them, sung by many different characters. Rocketman made the attempt to do that, but it was only for one or two songs, leaving the rest to just feel like the lyrics were just out of place. Had they gone further with that aspect, the film would have had much more of an impact as a musical, instead of being a half musical half biopic amalgamation.The writing itself was good for the most part, but the characters were not particularly fleshed out, mostly Elton's parents. His mother throughout most of the film was extremely supportive of his career, until suddenly out of nowhere there was a confrontation between the two of her saying that he's the biggest disappointment. Likely this is due to his many addictions, but the film gave us no indication that she even knew about his addictions, much less how they may have affected her.
The character of John Reid also seemed fairly underdeveloped, and seemed to only be there to serve as a one dimensional villain. Granted, I know very little about Elton John's history, but as an audience member watching the film, I would have like to have seen more justification as to this man convinced Elton that he loved him. It just seemed to be ""We've had sex twice, so now we're in love."" And then five seconds later he's abusive.
As for the last seen in the film it seemed so incredibly forced.The pacing in the film left much to be desired. Like Bohemian Rhapsody it has 20+ years to cover in only 2 hours, so I get that certain things must be adjusted for a storytelling purpose. But certain moments were barely used and then just thrown away without allowing it to sink in how they affected Elton. The biggest example of this in the film is his four year marriage to Renate Blauel, which is covered in about four minutes. Yes. Four minutes. And then is hardly mentioned again, without allowing us to really feel what Elton was feeling at the time.Overall the movie was fine, but there were a LOT of missed opportunities that could have made it great.",Rocketman

This film is a shining, shimmering journey of a man who becomes a legend and who slowly reclaims his humanity. Elton John is a god, and Reginald Dwight, the person he was born to be, a mere human of relative insignificance. Taron Edgerton is Elton John in this movie, completely, and through him we experience Elton in his man, myth, and legend forms - and how he attempts to reconcile all versions of himself in order to save himself.

I don't know if I've ever seen this level of acting from him before and the fact that he sings every song so bloody well truly elevates his performance.I was completely captivated by the musical performances in this film! The Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting) sequence made me want to get out of my seat and start dancing/flailing in the aisle and the Rocketman sequence was beautifully done. Both scenes were definitely the highlights of the film for me 💙I could go on and on about the brillance that was the production design, cinematography, editing and direction of this film but that would spoil so many amazing moments.I was so happy that they showed Elton John's journey without a pair of rose colored glasses on. You get to see him as a person and not just a persona and the film is better for it.I walked away from this experience with a new found respect for both Elton John and Taron Egerton and I can't wait to see it again!There's a scene towards the end of this movie where a single line is delivered from the past and the present and it will break/fill your heart.

Too many movies are not made to honor anything, as they are only written and filmed according to what the studio believes the majority of people want to see, without challenging anything that possibly could be offensive to prejudiced people, in an effort to make the most money to profit from. Many of these types of movies even go so far as to write and film entire segments of force-fed PC crap, but not because they were inspired to do so, but because their ""focus groups"" see that it's the current trend and want to jump on the bandwagon.Art is subjective and different people appreciate different art. It is not meant for small-minded, prejudiced people who can only appreciate ""art"" that is done the way they want and is a reflection of their own views and biases, without any challenge or exploration to he had.People that won't (or can't) tolerate minorities, including gay people and themes, shouldn't go watch a movie that is centered around the life of a GAY man...We have enough hate and struggle in this world. We would live in paradise if people even tried putting just half the amount of energy that is put into spreading hate and criticism into spreading something positive.",Rocketman

765,calchick-12806,What a disappointment:(,1,17 June 2019,"I am a huge Elton John fan starting from way back when I was a kid in the '70's, and although I knew not to expect a straight biopic from what I had already heard about the film, I certainly didn't expect this! From the first song straight through the rest of the film, all I was thinking is that what we were watching was the Broadway musical Elton has probably always wanted to do, and probably should have done instead of a film. Ironically, now there's talk of turning this into a musical, so why not have gone that route instead?I cannot even single out what was the worst thing about ""Rocketman"", but certainly the most irritating was the time frame of events/songs. My concern is that people of a younger generation who don't know much about Elton and see this film will think that certain things that occurred are fact, like that one of the songs he performed at the historic Troubadour show that helped catapult him to superstardom was ""Crocodile Rock"", when in reality, it hadn't even been written yet. Another concern was an example from a fan review I read on another website where a woman(who didn't seem like she was real familiar with Elton's life)said that after seeing ""Rocketman""(which she loved), she ""felt sorry"" for him. I really don't think that Elton John would want pity from his fans, but because there is so much emphasis on the unhappy events in his life, one who is not familiar with the man and his body of work would think he hardly had ANY good times in his life during that crazy superstar time, and he DID have a significant amount of fun, he has admitted in interviews over the last couple of decades.If this film was going to be a musical, it should have had at least a fair balance of good and bad times, and not so much a woe-is-me film. But even with a fair balance, the whole thing would have still probably been a hot mess with the way it was made. A straight biopic would have been SO much better. Somebody needs to make a REALLY good and detailed documentary(and it doesn't even have to be a film in theatres; it can be a multi-part series on a network like HBO or Showtime)on Elton John. If you really want to see something that more successfully captures the fascinating complexity that is Elton, I recommend watching ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" from 1997, the documentary that was directed by David Furnish(then-boyfriend, now husband). That will be far more interesting than ""Rocketman"" was, so save your money and skip ""Rocketman"", and I say this as somebody who's loved Elton John and his music for decades. Because I am a longtime fan, I really, really wanted to like, no, LOVE the film, but unfortunately, I just couldn't.",Rocketman
766,jkweber-35898,"Great singing, mediocre directing",7,16 September 2019,Edgerton does an amazing performance on the singing but I wasn't prepared for it to be musical theater. That belittled the story of Elton's courage and strength. A different style would have improved the movie. It was actually so slow in parts I couldn't believe it was only 2 hours. The music saved the movie.,Rocketman
767,nhurst-25146,Much better than last years Bohemian Rhapsody.,10,19 July 2019,"Hate making the comparison between the magnificent Rocketman and the fairly enjoyable Bohemian Rhapsody, but I'd like to compare it to something. I'm a huge, huge fan of Elton John and I loved Taron Egerton in both of the Kingsman movies but wow this movie really proves that he can act. He should win best actor oscar net year or at least get nominated for it.So here are the positives. I love the style of this movie. Obviously, Dexter Fletcher has done a great job of directing but I mean the musical numbers are great. Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting was a particular favourite in the film and I love the energy it displays. Now, I've mentioned how brilliant Egerton's acting is, but let me talk about his singing. HE'S GREAT IN THIS. I mean, the guy can sing and I bought the OST.Now on to the inevitable comparisons to Bohemian Rhapsody. That movie displayed a lot of incorrect facts about the band behind the scenes such as Freddie being diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and him breaking up the band by doing a solo album. Now this movie has a few historical inaccurasies but they're very minute such as Elton performing Crocodile Rock at the Troubadoure in 1970, but that's a very small detail. Bohemian Rhapsody was rated PG-13 which undoubtedly made it the huge hit it was but Freddie and the band did a lot of drugs and Freddie had huge gay orgys in the 80's. This movie shows everything.Anyway, the wrap it, I think this is a perfect movie and probably the best movie I've seen so far this year",Rocketman

(Because I guess we saw different movies?!) I'm now kind of concerned for their mental wellbeing... I also have to say, because people are doing this, DON'T compare this movie to Bohemian Rhapsody. Just because they're major rockstars from the same decade(s), in no way means the movies or storylines should be, or are, similar. That is comparing apples to oranges.Now:
This movie was phenomenal! Seriously. Inventive, creative, exciting, whacky, moving, funny, touching, saddening and uplifting. So well done. Taron was uncanny as Elton. Every other character's acting was great too. The movie tells a true story, HIS story, and it comes full circle in the end. (Those that are saying it isn't an accurate portrayal - I guess since you were there right alongside Elton and Bernie, you know better than the man himself! - c'mon. Seemed pretty damn accurate and reflective to me.)
If Taron isn't nominated for best actor, I'll be boycotting the Oscars until the end of time.

778,shaungburns,"Sex, drugs and musical biopics.",9,1 June 2019,"The movie is framed as a drug addled introspective though Elton's life told from a group therapy rehab session which becomes the climax of the film. The setting allows for an almost musical theatre of the absurd. The whole cast breaking out into a medley of his greatest hits throughout the film, in camp montages creating a tone that perfectly fit the subject.",Rocketman
779,trisha-j,Kind of a hot mess...,1,11 June 2019,"Rocketman displays such a strange mixture of self-pity and self-aggrandizement that it made the tone way too confusing to pin down. The character/story development is weak and a lot of the musical scenes seem to be thrown in there just to get some of Elton's hits out as a way to kill screen time.It shows Elton heavy into his addictions but doesn't really show how they started. Yeah ok, it shows the childhood roots of his pain that led to them, but for a ""warts and all"" biopic that is based around addiction, it doesn't give the audience enough of a look into how those addictions surfaced in his adult life. It also doesn't address the aftermath of his suicide attempt and doesn't show him recovering from his addictions. This was a VERY lazy look at addiction, its repercussions, and the healing process. That is why the biopic part doesn't work, so in the end it's just a showy musical that appeals to the senses.All it is is flash, glitz, and glam, with a bunch of sadness and negativity strewn into it, rather than having true quality substance. Bohemian Rhapsody knew the exact story it wanted to tell. It didn't make you think you were watching one thing and then another thing came in to distract you. It also didn't need to rely on gratuitous sex or drugs in order to get the point across that Freddie Mercury liked to have sex and do drugs. Sometimes less really is more...Some of the more explicit scenes are just so unnecessary. It's like they threw a bunch of random gay scenes on the screen just because they could. And they're gonna except praise for it and Academy Awards because it's ""progressive"". Now their team (including Elton & Taron) is angry that Russia is cutting out the gay scenes. And there have been talks that it might not even be released in China. They knew what they were doing when they followed through with Elton's R-rated vision for this movie. They have no right to complain.This movie does one thing really well...it gets you so distracted by good music and grand visuals that you are tricked into thinking you just saw an in depth story of Elton John's life. But those things do not make for a complete story.A lot of people seem to like that Rocketman is very different than Bohemian Rhapsody, but don't fool yourself into thinking it wasn't full of the typical biopic cliches and factual inaccuracies that you are all so vocal about with Bohemian Rhapsody. This movie doesn't even feel like it's a biopic about someone famous until you're reminded of it when the text comes on screen at the end, but it almost becomes laughable at that point because you just sat through 2 hours of watching unrealistic fantasy moments and the entire cast breaking out into random song and dance. Honestly, Rocketman's main goal seemed to be marketing Elton's songs for his farewell tour.Bohemian Rhapsody & Queen Freddie for the win!!",Rocketman

Half the time I tried to keep myself from laughing out loud at the cheesy musical numbers, crappy dialogue, and disjointed editing, and the other half I was rolling my eyes for the never-ending pity party.

782,jamie_ninja,A decent effort from a decent director,8,3 August 2019,"This film is a good example of a strong, yet not entirely accurate, portrayal of a musician battling addiction and alcoholism amidst his rise to stardom. ""Rocketman"" has some incredible acting featured in it, especially from Taron Egerton and Jamie Bell, whose on-screen chemistry is quite simply the beauty of the film and creates the sense that Elton John and Bernie Taupin truly did have a special bond in real life. Other decent performances come in the way of Richard Madden as John Reid, an abusive and manipulative music producer who is Elton's ""lover"" in the film and Bryce Dallas Howard, who portrays Elton's mother. Criticisms of this film include its inaccurate depiction of certain real-life events, the unnecessary singing of songs during key dramatic moments and the lack of an overall resolute ending to the plot (the film ends with Elton writing ""I'm Still Standing"" along with Bernie as he is checked out of rehab and the film ends with a brief summary of Elton having been over 28 years sober by the year 2019). Overall, I generally enjoyed watching this film and it's definitely worth a viewing but in my opinion, it's not as worthy of attention as director Dexter Fletcher's previous work, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", in which Rami Malek won the Academy Award For Best Actor for his phenomenal portrayal of Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury.",Rocketman
783,mpshrout,To be honest!,9,12 June 2020,"A lot of the negative reviews complain about the 'musical' aspects, but that is exactly what I loved about it. This move wasn't meant to be 100% factual but instead tell you a story full of emotions and chaos. It uses the music from his career to relate to moments in history and creates a really fun experience.If you don't like musicals where people randomly break into song you aren't going to like this movie. If you are looking for a straightforward truthful tale of Elton John this isn't exactly what you are looking for. It's the experience of Elton John.

My friend raved about this film so last night I sat down to watch it..... W.T.FThe film tries TOO hard to be unique, to the point where it's corny and cringey. The acting from some of the cast was so poor (most weren't cast for the right role although they are usually very good in other films) and the script felt like a GCSE Drama piece or Christmas play.However, the serious scenes without all the silly parts added were very good and very touching. Elton's story IS in itself, very emotional and about growth. The relationship between him and other characters is portrayed very well, especially the pain felt at the rejection of his parents. I found myself hating and loving some characters which showed you can really invest in the story that they're telling when some scenes are done right!
I would've given this much higher praise if it had concentrated on being a drama rather than a silly piece of musical theatre (and I normally love musicals). Would've been so much more suited to a West End show.",Rocketman

Must be a dream come true.Then the movie itself. I love how it didnt picture things better than they were. It was purely honest about his addictions on drugs, sex and alcohol and his sexuality what wasnt hidden or faded away from the scenes.The music in Rocketman wasnt carrying the movie. It made the movie a musical masterpiece. All the songs were in a sync with whatever was going on Elton's journey from Reggie Dwight to music genious who has touched millions of people.The most touching moment of Rocketman was the ending. ""When are you gonna hug me?"", truely made its point clear.

I was so happy to be so wrong! I found it to be a very relatable film about facing our demons. Despite its 2 hour length, not a moment was superfluous.

Sometimes, things didn't seem to be chronologically accurate.
I thought that the acting was good and the singing was terrific. I learned some things. And the lack of love and support and kindness from Elton's parents broke my heart.

What it is ***spoiler alert*** is a biopic about someone name Elton John. What a great film, though. Very well done and artistic.Rocketman was entertaining, and the music brought to life what Elton and the other characters were feeling. Whereas Bohemian Rhapsody was a biopic, Rocketman was more like a musical. There is a lot of heart and soul behind the music.The cast and directing was first rate. Taron Egerton was phenomenal.By the end of the film, I felt like Elton was a personal friend of mine. The music and story really captured how lonely and confused Elton felt. Thought provokingly, it makes sense how his lack of support structure (except his best friend), trying to come to grips with his sexuality, and the pressures of fame were real life challenges to him.I look forward to seeing this again. There were a lot of artistic subtleties in how the story was told and how it unfolded.I did not find the homosexual ""sex scenes"" uncomfortable. Heck, Game of Thrones had sex scenes that made my wife and I more uncomfortable than Rocketman. I wouldn't let negative media reviews scare you off. Nothing to be afraid of. But what is portrayed is relevant to the story and really lets you in Elton's mind and struggles.All around this is a classic, memorable movie. I hope this gets a lot of awards!",Rocketman
796,KrustyFrank27,A lot of flash for a little substance,5,31 May 2019,"Taron Egerton's performance is superb in Rocketman. If only the film surrounding it matched up to it.I felt a real identity crisis from this movie: did it want to be a run-of-the-mill biopic of a popular musician or a jukebox musical with a framework story depicting his life? In trying to tow the line between the two and committing to neither, it threw its tone completely off course and failed to live up to either.I also would have accepted the spoke/sung song moments if I also got full performances of some songs, but there were verses or full sections cut from almost every song that was done as an Elton John performance.It's unfair to routinely compare this movie to Bohemian Rhapsody, but given that director Dexter Fletcher seems to be returning to his own playbook for this film, the comparisons seem apt. There are several moments which seem copied almost word for word and line for line from BR (anything with the manager and business dealings, for one), and the trajectory of the musicians' careers and lives within the queer community seem almost cut and pasted from one to the other.Ultimately, this is not a bad film. It just seemed to be simultaneously trying too much unconventional material and playing the same old game to become satisfied with the film.(This is all to say nothing of the moment when Elton is performing in full Dodger regalia and blasts off like a literal rocket man.)",Rocketman

I'll probably be wearing out my Elton John Spotify playlist for the next few weeks. If you are a fan of his music, you're going to have a hard time not singing along. Taron did a good job of covering his songs as well as the other cast members. I only gave it 8 stars because there are a couple of tiny times when it was a bit choppy. The continuity may have been messed up with editing due to time constraints.

Furnish; Exec Producer: E. John) that it's embarrassing.It was all 'poor me, my mother didn't love me and my father never gave me a hug'. Yet he still comes across as a self-pitying, self-centred, selfish prick. Even more so than I already thought.Some of the scenes are hard to watch, not because they are heart-rending, but because they are toe-curlingly awful.Taron Egerton did a good job with the singing to be fair, must have knocked out his scenes in a couple of weeks.It will do well, of course, just like BR did.

799,liginanton,"It's not just a biographical film, it's a beautiful poem on screen!",9,6 June 2019,"So this movie certainly calls for comparisons with another film that came out last year. When I had seen the first trailer for 'Rocketman', my initial reaction was ""Wow, now there's another 'Bohemian Rhapsody' - style movie coming out. I don't think I would watch it in a movie theatre"". I thought this not because I didn't like Bohemian Rhapsody; in fact I had goosebumps throughout that film! But honestly that was because I'm a huge 'Queen' fan and a major part of that film was literally a series of scenes showing the composing / recording of the greatest Queen songs followed by recreation of some of their iconic stage performances of those songs (a total fantasy for a fanboy! :p ). But I'm not a ""fanboy"" of Elton John. I do love 4 or 5 songs of his (""Can you feel the love tonight"" is one of my all-time favourites), but there was nothing strong that would excite me for this movie. But looking at the very positive critical response for this film, I decided to watch it, with a fair amount of skepticism, on the big screen. Boy, I was wrong to doubt this film from its trailer. This film's approach is very different from Bohemian Rhapsody. Rocketman is a very well-crafted film with brilliant direction, some gorgeous set-pieces and camera-work, and a flawless work by the lead actor. Taron Egerton completely merges into Elton John's character and delivers an outstanding performance, which I liked even better than Rami Malek's Oscar winning performance last year. The first 10 mins of the film itself captured my full attention and I knew then that I'm in for a very refreshing experience. This film feels like an epic poem portraying Reginald Dwight's story in a very personal and emotional manner. Unlike ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", where the purpose of the songs were limited to entertaining the audience (mostly fans), here, Elton John's songs (recreated, and sung by Taron himself) serve as a device for storytelling: the film-makers cleverly use the musical-style approach to depict happening of events, and passage of time. Sure, there are sequences where people burst into singing and dancing, but all of them feel to serve a narrative purpose, rather than mere entertainment or extension of the film's run-time. The film does feel to drag a bit in between because we are quite familiar with the framework of a biopic of a huge star. Moreover, we have revised this arc only last year. But here the usual tropes of a film about the rise, fall, and comeback of a star are interwoven with strong thematic elements of loneliness, longing to be loved, and embracing one's true self, all of which make Rocketman a much deeper film that I had imagined!",Rocketman

The swimming pool scene is particularly good - and the first song at the troubadour gig.*spoiler* in those final scenes - forgiving himself and embracing the young child he once was - is poignant.

805,oliasdoug-407-409444,Should have expected this.,7,19 May 2019,"It's going to get very mixed reviews. I predict many will love it, and many will revile it. I was caught somewhere in the middle. Without giving any actual spoilers away, consider this:1. If you absolutely HATE musicals, save your money. This is the John/Taupin equivalent of a Rodgers & Hammerstein. It is not presented as a straightforward biopic in the same manner as BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.
2. Much as I love Elton John, this ""rock & roll fantasy"" of his life treads a little too far into campy territory for me, with 2, maybe 3 very (thankfully) brief moments in the film that can only be described as cringeworthy. (""Oh, come on, guys--seriously?"" moments.) There were times when I genuinely felt this was going to end up as the Ken Russell version of TOMMY for the new millennium.
3. Never, at any point in the film, is Paul Buckmaster mentioned or acknowledged. This infuriated me! For those who don't already know: in the early days of EJ's career, Paul was the orchestrator who provided EJ with the BEAUTIFUL, lush string accompaniments that added so much to EJ's early music (classic example: EJ's soundtrack to the 1971 French film, FRIENDS) and, IMHO, could have been a big player in his success as a burgeoning artist, firmly introducing/establishing The Elton John ""Sound."" He SHOULD have been a part of this film--even a small one, if deemed necessary--but for him to be utterly omitted from the story mystifies me. Maybe someone in the know can enlighten me on this.These 3 things, however, are about my only problems with the film. Credit must be given where it's due:1. Taron Egerton is actually pretty amazing. Some might see his acting as occasionally over the top, but frankly and for all we know, maybe EJ really did act that ""extremely"" at times, considering his anger issues. His singing, most of the time, is virtually spot-on, catching EJ's lilting singing style quite well.
2. The supporting cast:
Jamie Bell (Bernie Taupin), Bryce Dallas Howard , Richard Madden (EJ's agent & self-centered 1st lover), Stephen Graham (Dick James), Tate Donovan (L.A.'s Troubador Club manager Doug Weston), Gemma Jones (Ivy, EJ's grandmother, I think...? Or friend of the family?) & Steven Mackintosh (EJ's cold, uncaring father)...and all others in the film, essentially faultless. ESPECIALLY Jamie's portrayal of Bernie. Wow.
3. You can't really find fault with the staging and choreography of the musical numbers. Very professionally done.
4. You will learn many things about EJ's life in this film that you may not have known before...I know I did.
5. Have a few Kleenexes handy. Enough said.
6. Don't leave right away after the credits roll.So, is it worth seeing? My criticisms aside (and we all know what they say about opinions), it really comes down to this: if you're a fan--and especially a DEDICATED fan, like me, who's followed him from his humble beginnings in America in the summer of 1970--go see it. Decide for yourself if my gripes hold any water.",Rocketman
806,terrance-465-293900,A fantastic musical journey,10,9 June 2019,"A brilliantly conceived, directed, and acted piece of film. It's a non-stop musical journey through Elton John's first chapter, from his rise to stardom, through his fall into addiction, and his recovery. If you're a music lover and/or an Elton John fan this is a must see.",Rocketman
807,ldodgson,Disappointing,6,21 May 2019,"First of all this is a musical & reminded me very much of The Who's Tommy - it's not just a biop so if you like traditional musicals you will enjoy this.
Second, Taron Egerton was fantastic. Jamie Bell aside the rest of the cast were bland and forgettable
Problem is that I just couldn't warm to Elton. I know that as part of this vanity project, Elton wanted a warts and all portrayal, I think there was just a few too many warts. Whilst Bohemian Rhapsody was uplifting & celebrated the music of Freddie & the Queen boys this to me didn't celebrate Elton's music just showed what an almighty Pr*** he is. Disappointing",Rocketman
808,kymahony,Hard to Watch,3,17 June 2019,"Clunky acting (mostly) obvious themes, zero subtlety, and incredibly self indulgent. It was like he took the notes from his therapists office, and turned them into a movie so he could cry about his terrible life and how hard he's had it.",Rocketman

The music added seemlessly to the story. What they showed was how personal his music was and how he was making music about his life . It would be interesting to hear how much imput he had into the movie making. And how his old manager felt about the way he is presented... As being greedy and self centred. It is a lesson on addiction and overcoming addiction. Well done John. And for making sacrifices to be present to raise your kids",Rocketman

It felt disjointed all the way until the rather abrupt end, when they tell you things got better instead of showing you, which was incredibly annoying. I spend almost two hours suffering through the drama, only for the happy ending to happen off screen.However, I have to give credit, where credit is due. The acting is superb, and I'm not only talking about Taron who is deserves every superlative that has been used to describe him in this film.

It's about mental health, addiction, finding self-acceptance, and learning to love yourself.Taron Egerton is absolutely magnificent as Elton John! The way he portrays emotions, the look in his eyes, the tone of his voice, everything, is just stunning and really let's you feel the pain and the emotions he's going through.

I credit Elton John for getting me through my awkward tween years. I have always regarded him as my musical idol; his music worked its magic in my confused and wandering mind, and his unique style stole my teenage heart. Rocketman is everything I was hoping it would be and so much more. The performances are perfection, the costumes and sets are gloriously spot on, the choreography is spectacular, the music is pure joy, and Taron Egerton is Elton John, hands down. He'll have an Oscar, no question.",Rocketman
818,jasonmac-09717,A rocket without fuel,1,1 June 2020,"It took me three separate occasions to finally get through this movie. As someone in their twenties who has always enjoyed Elton John music on the radio, but didn't know much about the man, this film negatively impacted his music for me personally. After watching Bohemian Rhapsody I immediately started listing to Queen and started to discover more songs not popular on the radio. I cannot say the same for Elton John. I really have no increased interest in perusing more Elton John music.",Rocketman

820,sedeno-65005,Not what I expected,1,12 August 2019,"My wife and friends were expecting a bio-pic about Elton John, hopefully a little like Bohemian Rhapsody but not too much. What we saw was a surreal musical where he sings to his younger self at the bottom of a pool during a suicide attempt. In fact he sang to himself for so long that the paramedics were waiting for him by the time he was fished out. The movie certainly delivered the gay sex scenes that BoRap was criticized for omitting. A shame though as those would have probably been the best musical numbers in the movie if they had chose to do so. One scene could have been titled ""Reggie's First Black Lover"" and a horrible song could have followed which could have segued into Elton needing Bernie as a songwriter. Opportunity missed for sure. Nothing about this movie grabbed my attention and held it for very long. It's mostly a series of darkly shot musical numbers to hide to the CGI transitions and little else. Taron Edgerton was great as usual and it's too bad they made a crap musical instead of a movie. It ends with them inserting Taron into the actual video for I'm Still Standing. So bad. Just so bad",Rocketman
821,jennifer12090,I was expecting more,7,2 June 2019,Given how wonderful and fantastic Elton John is as a performer and singer I was really hoping for a more true biopic display of his story. I hate to say it because it'll be said time and time again but Bohemian Rhapsody hit on every point that I was hoping rocket man would. Although it was artistically creative it just really wasn't what I was looking for in the story of Elton John and I really would have liked to see more performances or replica of concerts he had performed in their entirety rather than one or two songs.,Rocketman

It was very informative but done in an extremely fun way. All of the actors were outstanding. I am very partial to costuming in movies, and I don't see how this movie is not going to win the Academy award for best costuming. This is definitely a movie I will be watching numerous times.

I knew it was going to be a musical from the commercials, I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I figured a musical with Elton John songs would have to be good, it wasn't, I left the theatre feeling sad, I wanted to feel bouyant like I did watching the scene at The Troubadour where the audience and Elton John floated off the ground with the feeling Elton John's music gave them. I really, really wanted to like this movie, I really, really tried to like it, I didnt. I sat in my seat for a while after it ended, my friend misunderstood my actions, he thought I wanted to see it again, I said I was trying to process my sad, disappointed feelings and one viewing was more than enough.
The acting was good, the actor playing Elton John was especially good, he was a pretty good singer, but I would have rather heard Elton John singing his own songs in his own movie.

I still have these marvelous songs in my head and I remember the poetic images that the filmmaker put on these hits.It maybe not the reality, some had proved that it's Elton's point of view on his father and other cruel characters around him, but the lyrics of Bernie were prophetic. They have been written in the first year of his carreer and they are accurate about what happen years after.I don't want to compare with Bohemian Rhapsody. They are 2 different films and 2 different styles. I like both for the same reason, the beautiful music. But I also like them for different reasons: BR is a biopic with an actor who was like the original Freddie and he deserves an Oscar for this interpretation, RM is a musical with an actor who play a character inspired by Elton John and he was great for that too.Taron Egerton is a very good actor and I know that he will be on the AAA list for a long time.Just wait to see the movie again on my home cinema big screen with volume high!!",Rocketman

829,eastmanyes,DID I WATCH THE WRONG TRAILER?,2,17 June 2019,"This movie misses on every level starting with the deceptive trailer. I love Elton John and his humanity. Never cared about his gayness. It is two hours of you being beat up by the gay struggle. Twenty minutes of the film to tell his parents he's gay? They didn't know? A lot of people walked out during the very long unnecessary sex scene. This is a no fun ever look at a guy that I think loves to have a good time. Is it a musical/dance/broadway play/live concert/ music video? Who knows? And guess how all these classic songs were written? Bernie walks up. ""I wrote a poem."" Elton puts it to music.

832,kent71265,High Expectations,2,24 March 2021,Being a big Elton John fan from his earlier years I was excited by the rock and roll fantasy look of movie. Turns out the previews are far better than the movie. It may be harsh but I hated this movie. Forgettable at best. I think Taron is an excellent actor and give him props for singing those songs but why wouldn't you use one of the greatest voices in rock and roll? He just didn't live up to Eltons voice. I would have rather lip synching Just my opinion.,Rocketman

It felt like they compiled a list of songs they wanted in this movie, and just jumped from one point of his life to the next, depending on where the songs were relevant.
The music and acting were amazing, but the characters felt very one-dimensional. They didn't spend enough time developing his relationships with anyone except his closest friend Bernie, or into his start down his destructive path. One minute he's talking calmly, the next he's shouting at people and after that he's downing pills with alcohol. They could've trimmed the some of the songs movie and spent some more time developing some of these key aspects.",Rocketman

I do believe I'm being kind and offering it a 10 stars out of 10. It's mainly due to the fact that I love musicals, but I also can see why this is not everyone's cup of tea. I think the movie embodied what Elton John himself wanted to portray, based off interviews I saw. People just have to understand that this film is supposed to help relay the theatricals of it that he felt during his lifetime.

846,therealrowlandscheessele,Lack of consistency and very confused structure.,7,8 June 2019,"Rocketman definitely has a lot going for it. It has an amazing cast, great production value, an authentic portrayal of Sir Elton John, great music and a strong first act. In addition, it doesn't fully fit into the standard music biopic formula, letting it stand on its own in that genre. However, I found the movie to be very tonally inconsistent and not fully committed to any kind of storytelling or structure. This would be fine if executed well but the film takes long brakes in between its different segments. The movie will jump from serious arthouse drama centered on the character of Elton John to a fantastical musical. Both are really good ideas and have great moments but they don't work all the time. Having random instances of each are very confusing and they don't work well in the way they're are presented.",Rocketman
847,numchuck-35937,Victimized Diva Pretending to be a Rockstar,2,4 June 2019,"Rocketman tries hard to portray Elton John as a deeply troubled artist plagued by inner demons and personal conflict. Instead, he comes off as a victimized diva that makes poor choices.The more empathetic and interesting character in this film is Bernie Taupin, John's writing partner, who always seems to be at the brunt end of John's many temper tantrums. Despite Taupin's constant statements throughout the film of how he loves John like a brother, nothing seems to be good enough for John. There is a scene where Taupin leaves John on his own at a party to spend time with a girl. This unleashes John into a jealous rage that seems to last for years. The nerve of Taupin.A musician strung out on drugs is not a new concept for biopics. However, most reveal a 'hero wound' that at least partially explains the subjects addictions. This backstory should not excuse their behavior, but at least it gives the audience some valuable insight into their tortured soul. John's increasing drug use seems to have come entirely from selfish choice. In one very static scene, John admits to his mother that he loves his decadent lifestyle. The scene isn't played out as a man crying out for help, or an admission of guilt; it's more of a matter-of-fact statement by John.The only real problem in John's life seems to be that his parents neglected him as a child. Neglect is a terrible thing, but is this really all we get? How is the audience supposed to empathize (or sympathize) with a 25-year-old multimillionaire who's biggest problem in life is that his daddy didn't hug him?Yes, in the end he goes to a rehab center and all is well. But it all feels very disingenuous. John never really apologizes to anyone for his behavior. Instead, we get a slew of characters walking into the frame in a forced manner to reaffirm how much they hate him and how victimized he is. Then there is a climactic scene where he hugs a younger version of himself. Tear.One aspect of the film that had potential for further development was John's confusion about his sexuality. This could have served as a better source of conflict. The seventies and eighties were a very different time, and this turmoil could have been portrayed in a new and interesting way. There was also a sub-plot about his failed marriage to a woman, which took up a whole ten minutes of screen time.Most biopics have to be approved by living relatives or their estate because the subject has passed away. What makes Rocketman a rare exception is that not only is the subject still alive, he is the producer of the film. This almost certainly creates a one-sided story that has had all the negative aspects omitted, leaving us with only what John has approved for the viewer. The cheesy still picture montage at the end showing us what a good person and humanitarian he is says it all.It is kind of ironic, since we just saw nearly two hours of a victimized diva who has wrapped himself in decadence, and liked it. Who can root for a 'hero' with these traits?",Rocketman

849,filmltd,Not as good as its proclaimed to be.,4,7 July 2019,"Much like Elton in the film, Rocketman had no sense of what it wanted to be and therefore leaves audiences in an emotionless state in which they can do nothing but side against the unloveable portrayal of Elton John in the film.

853,jos_hort,A tad superficial & self indulgent,6,28 May 2019,I love Elton John's songs and know a bit about his history having grown up with much of it but this film felt like a missed opportunity to tell his story with true pathos or make the most out of his friendship with Taupin.

I was suspicious as it said it was in the fantasy genre, but it was very much grounded in reality and told this story beautifully. I went with people who typically dislike anything with a hint of musical in it and they all loved it.I have found nothing I could use as justification for less than a 10/10. The facts check out.

Jamie Bell also gave a solid performance as John's lyricist Bernie Taupin. All of the other performances were decent as well. The dialog wasn't bad or cringeworthy, with the exception of executive Dick James. Nothing was done POORLY necessarily, but I will say if Egerton was not in this film, I probably would have rated Rocketman a 4/10 or even a 3/10.
Let me get into all of my issues with this film.Firstly I need to mention that Rocketman is a musical, where moments of his life or feelings are related to John's many songs. I only feel the need to mention this because I feel the marketing was very misleading, convincing people that Rocketman was going to be a more conventional biopic. Now, the musical moments are done badly, but for a feature film that is about a REAL person and story, it doesn't fit well. What the writers and director were trying to go for would have made a better broadway show, instead of a theatrical release. There are also WAY too many of these musical-style moments, particularly in the final third. And to clarify, by ""musical"" I'm referring to a film like Moulin Rouge.I also felt like Rocketman glossed over a HUGE amount of events In John's life such how he recorded his first few albums, how he wrote songs with Bernie, etc. They could of included a scene of Elton helping John Lennon overcome stage freight or any other interesting stories during Elton's golden era, but Rocketman flashes forward to the start of his career to when he starts to descend into drugs. The most important part of his career is pushed to the side. Another example of this involves John's wife. We don't know who she is, how she knows him, or even her name. The actress is literally given around 6 lines. So when her three minutes of screen time are up, and you find out her and John have divorced, you don't care because you learned nothing about her.Also, going back to the musical aspect, some inaccuracies end up being raised. Like how Elton wrote Saturday's Alright for Fighting at 12 (which he didn't). I also question the idea of everyone he knew, save Taupin and his grandma, were so harsh and mean.Overall, Rocketman isn't an awful film by any means, and with Egerton's performance and the Your Song scene, I can still recommend this to extreme John fans. Otherwise, wait to rent.",Rocketman
861,lsafilm,TARON SOARS ELTON SHAKES THE ROOF,10,19 May 2019,"Before I go further to mention how outstanding this film is, and why it destroys last years musical rock show Bohemian Rhapsody, id like to state one thing.There is NO POSSIBLE way for any writers or directors, even if Sir Elton John was to produce the film, to fit in every detail of Elton complex life. So do not approach the movie wanting to see a documentary so much, but approach it as a dark concert. I state this because as much back lash Bohemian Rhapsody got for this its the wrong way to look at a film.The movie does a fantastic job of creating a sort of fantasy perspective of Elton's life wile including lots of important timeline information, but it only hints to the more important ones.The films themes are pretty straight forward and I often find it misleading when people come and say that this film has no story. What is to know becomes known, and a lot of privacy walls are broken to show the true grit, and raw performance of the rock star.As to be expected it highlights homosexuality, and the conflicting family issues arising from that. (The Main Theme)
But also manages to fit in many other small themes, that I wont address to prevent any spoilers of the film.It also in a way is a very true story. Maybe not in the sense of every detail being accurate, but the performance of Taron is jaw dropping. Taron takes an approach of his own to the Singer, and makes his own version of Elton, which is delicious yet challenging, but manages to pull of perfect;y with his upbeat dancing and natural sounding trained voice. So during the entire film you can relate a ton to Taron and his version of Elton. Almost to an unbearable point when we learn of the tragedies and dark elements of being like every Rock star.Overall, ill have to cut it short. It's just a hell of a movie. Visuals, colors, transitions, soundtrack, choreography, and acting is superb. You feel the time drifting on by as you rock your way through 2 hours of one of the worlds most famous musicians, and look deep into the demons and faults of being a star.",Rocketman

Taron did such an amazing job conveying every emotion to the fullest, not to mention his singing was so smooth and wonderful, they couldn't have casted better for this role. Everyone apart of this movie did an amazing job, I cry easily so I don't know how much weight this holds but I was tearing up at least three times.

865,Inthewoodnotout,Very very disappointed,1,22 May 2019,"A musical journey of self pitying cheese. Written for theatre rather than the big screen, the script was wooden and dry. Musically all the hits were there, but interwoven as a musical the story line just didn't work. I wasn't the only one either, people actually got up and left half way and many of the audience were suffering at the ridiculousness of... hey I'm having a crisis..! Ooh, well let's sing a song about it... tra lah lah... Now don't get me wrong Elton John has more talent in my little finger than I will ever have, but his story should never have stooped to this level of boring musical surrealism. The lead actor was great, but his talent was barely stretched and was at times corny to say the list. The icing on the cake was at the end credits when the self idolisation went even further without a hint of any of the hardships that continued in his life after the timeline had ceased. Apologies if I was left thinking that other than one person in his life who he admires, he just played the victim and the blame game. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth wondering why a new song was not write for the film entitled 'Pity Me It Was all Your Fault and Nothing to do With me.' Perhaps he could sing that one with Kiki Dee....",Rocketman
866,natbirch-53441,Amazing film,10,24 May 2019,"This film does everything amazingly - it captures the humanity of Elton John as well as his superstardom, balances music and dialogue and has great artistic design. One of the best films I've seen all year",Rocketman
867,peterearle-96668,ROCKETMAN GOES INTO ORBIT,10,29 May 2019,"I have read a number of reviews which unfortunately seem to miss the point of this movie.Director Dexter Fletcher's aim was to make an entertaining musical setting out the stages in Elton's life from his relatively humble and somewhat unstable family life to establishing himself as the most successful solo pop act on the planet. Fletcher has not shirked from showing the impact that fortune and fame had on someone who was not emotionally equipped to handle success on such a scale and this brilliantly forms the backbone of the narrative.I have been an EJ fan since 1970 and had to ignore the inaccuracies and omission from the movie of certain people who were so instrumental in Elton's career. I appreciate this is inevitable and necessary to establish a succint, coherent story line and believe that this would not be noticed by the majority of cinema goers who are watching to be entertained.Being entertaining is where the movie really succeeds .... this was also true of BoRhap which in turn was panned by most critics, yet went on to be a stunning success at the box office and with the Academy. Sadly for Taron Egerton, it is unlikely the Academy will award the oscar next year to another pop biopic leading man... a pity as his performance is astounding.Making entertaining musicals which successfully tell a story is incredibly difficult; Rocket man succeeds brilliantly where many have failed. The use of EJ's songs and in particular the poignant lyrics provided by Bernie Taupin to highlight turning points in Elton's life is at times breathtaking. The staging of shows, particularly the first US concert at The Troubado and the Brooklyn Dodger's concert bring to life seminal moments in Elton's career which all fans will wish they could have attended.The use of the confessional scenes also works extremely well and it is brave of Elton to have allowed such a 'warts and all' exposure on this scale. I must also mention the supporting cast, who are exemplary and some of whom demonstrate great vocal talents to add to their acting skills. I will be astonished if the film does not pick up awards galore for the music, choreography, costumes and editing.Whilst an entertainment, this is a musical for grown ups and I acknowledge that certain scenes may make uncomfortable viewing for some which will lead to a restricted potential audience. However, this is a depiction of Elton's life and perhaps without these character flaws, his music and performances would have been less mercurial.Whether or not you are an Elton John fan, I urge you to see this movie as it is in a class of it's own making and has set the bar incredily high for makers of future musical entertainment.",Rocketman
868,lmullan-12678,It could have been so much better.,5,30 March 2020,"Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good points in this movie. The acting from all cast members was very impressive, same with the production and how the movie was directed itself. But what bothered me is that there were many points in this movie that were not covered, for example, all of Elton's biggest hits, there is barely any coverage or detail into the story of how they were actually recorded or how they came about. It was just a case of, ""here's some lyrics, write some music.""
I think Bohemian Rhapsody did a much better job on documenting these parts of Queen's journey, which for me made the movie a lot more gripping.All in all, if you are an Elton John fan I would definitely watch the movie, but if not i don't think you would be getting the representation that you should be getting on the man's career.",Rocketman

Stephen Graham as Dick James- Gemma Jones as Gran - Steven Mackintosh as his cold-hearted father and Richard Madden as John Reid aqll of them wonderful.

This is a sad excuse for a movie, as it is basically a musical. Was quite uneventful and unenjoyable. Upsetting that no singing was done by Elton himself, and weird that random characters would break out into songs originally sung by Elton. I had high expectations for this movie thinking it would be similar to Bohemian Rhapsody, it was not, all in all terrible movie. Would not recommend to a friend.",Rocketman

movie. I was bitterly disappointed. This movie was boring and a typical story of rags to riches with all the emotional baggage you could think of. Elton John is far more of a person than what the story told and to focus purely on all his destructive behavior, poor choices, sexual identity and sad family life is not anything new. Elton John has achieved far greater things in his life than what was depicted in this movie and none of this was shown. Sad really.",Rocketman

The movie starts off as a musical, a type of movie I can barely tolerate, and just when you think it's morphed into an actual story about the career of Elton, you're back in a musical. The time line of the songs written by Bernie are laughably out of order leaving any real Elton fan rolling their eyes. Apparently there was not one happy moment in Elton's entire life until he went into rehab. If you're an Elton fan it's a must see, but keep your expectations low.",Rocketman

876,msmckenna,How Wrong I Was.,10,8 June 2019,"I am of that certain age wherein Freddie Mercury and Elton John defined my early life. (Back when people still spun vinyl and listened to music on AM radio.)I didn't think ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" could be topped, but it now has been.While it would be easy to say that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Rocketman"" are just biopic films about two different 1970s-1980s British music greats, it's not that simple.The films are quite different. ""Rocketman"" is much more like ""a musical,"" with big casts performing in numbers. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was (IMO) more of an alternation as between drama - concert - drama - concert.IMO, ""Rocketman"" really takes you inside the mind, heart and soul of a man who is so enormously gifted, but hurting the hearts of those around him. Terribly sad that Sir Elton HAD TO BE the one person who understood his talent and worth. (And I think he does, now.) But he didn't really grasp how important he was at the peak of his career.I don't think this a ""spoiler""? I believe ""the core"" of the film is about his collaboration and deep friendship with lyricist Bernie Taupin. They were the brothers they never had, and did not always, in the moment, understand that.",Rocketman
877,wtfmoviebook,And I seldom give 10s,9,11 June 2019,"The only thing that could keep Taron Egerton off the Best Actor list is this movie coming right on the heels of Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddie Mercury. Hollywood has a need to always be edgy and they won't want the same kind of role to win back-to-back Best Actor Awards. Otherwise, Mr. Egerton is (at least at the moment) a lock.But guys, at least those of you over 50, if you want to get laid tonight, take her to see this movie.

878,isobelebarker,A Beautiful Fantasy,10,11 June 2019,"I want to start by saying that I really struggle to sit through longer films, I get restless and my attention wavers (a little sad I know, but it is what it is). When I left the cinema I couldn't believe the running time - including adverts etc I'd sat through 2h30 without even thinking about the time once. I was completely engrossed!
Taron Egerton, alongwith his co stars perform excellently in this fantasy based musical, taking you through the highs and lows of Elton Johns earlier life. It's a real rollercoaster experience, I loved it!
There were many moments which made me smile of bought a tear to my eye for different reasons, I'll name a couple of my favourites. Elton arrives in America and performs Crocodile Rock. There's so much passion in his performance and then comes this euphoric, floating fantasy scene, it's so beautiful and a great piece of cinematography which immerses you and makes you feel like you are there in that room. I also loved the way Elton and Bernie's friendship was shown, it was so lovely to watch. There's a really touching scene where Elton is playing his piano, creating music to accompany the lyrics to Your Song. Bernie is upstairs shaving, yet is drawn to the dining room to listen to Elton bring his song to life. Elton's singing the lyrics and keeps looking over to Bernie, seemingly singing it to Bernie platonically, as a love song. You see a real bond between the pair of them.
One scene that got me the most was after Elton had tried to commit suicide, they showed him being rushed to hospital which once he arrived there was a routine in which he was treated and prepared by everyone around him to perform on stage immediately as he forces a smile. It just showed how much he suffered and how money came first, it was really poignant. Again, a beautiful piece of work.
There's so much more to talk about, such as the relationships between him and his mum/dad/new manager come lover and how they were all equally as cold and callous. Or the scenes in which Elton has visions of his younger self, comforting a younger Elton at the end of the film with a hug - all he ever wanted. However we'd be here all day!
I truly adored this film and it's definitely one to watch on the big screen. It bought out so many emotions and that's what I think a film should do. So glad I've seen it and have recommended it to everyone who's mentioned it!",Rocketman

Just like Taron Egerton said: It's full of colour, glitter, sparkle, magic, beautiful music, sex, rock&roll and most importantly of all, heart.Everything was absolutely wonderful, from the music to choreography, from the costumes to the performances, from the direction to the cast and the crew.
🚀#rocketmanmovie is showing Sir Elton John's perspective on his own life without hold back traumatic experience and is showing many layered emotions most people can't understand. What a brilliant journey to celebrates the ups and the lows of Elton John's life.
🚀Taron Egerton is nailed it as Elton. He portrayed Sir Elton John in the most stunning way, he really captured his motions and his facial expressions, it's amazing. His voice doesn't sound exactly like Elton, however, he performs so freaking wonderful it's easy to ignore that fact, it even more awesome because he can successfully put put his own spin on it and and make it sound incredible. And Jamie Bell, he did so good as a friend like Bernie Taupin. I love that he was casted for this role. There was so many chemistry between them in the movie. What a special friendship they both portrayed.
All the other cast were spectacular too. Btw: Richard Madden has left me wanting to punch him in his beautiful face :).
🚀The soundtrack is unreal, it's so similar and different from the original at the same time, and it had somes beautiful new touches.🚀The costumes, it's all in the details. THEY'RE SO GORGEOUS OMG! Hand down!Every review I've hear about #rocketman is just so positive and I love hearing about it, because it's honestly what the entire cast and crew deserve. Thank you all for this gift, you all deserve all the love in the world. Sir Elton John, thank you for sharing your early life to us. We loved you then and we love you more now.

884,fredandgeorgerule,Holy. Mother. Of God.,10,19 June 2019,"Let me tell you a story. There was a girl once, about two or three weeks ago, who avoided studying for her physics exam by watching celebrities read thirst tweets and other such videos. In one video or another this comment popped up:""I can't believe we have to wait 5 months to see a sex scene with Taron Egerton and Richard Madden""There were 3 things she realised in that video:1. The comment was about the movie ""Rocketman"", a movie about the life of Sir Elton John.
2. That comment was about 5 months old.
3. Both those actors are very, very good-looking.She looked it up, and -what do you know- that movie had premiered the day before, and there was a showing that night at 10. The trailer looked interesting. After endless texts, and a small argument or two with her mother, she ended up going alone to the cinema (and apparently she was the only one who went to that movie that night). She didn't know anything about Elton John, not even his music (she knew Crocodile Rock but not that it was his).Long story short, I became an EJ fan because of a random comment. Life is funny like that sometimes, it seems.I loved this movie. As a huge theater nerd, it's always a bonus if something ends up unexpectedly being a musical. Cause this is what ""Rocketman"" is: a musical rather than a biopic. I couldn't spot the inaccuracies, and I don't care too much either. The movie packs a lot of emotional punches, and it brought me on the verge of tears more than once--no movie has done that in years. Everyone's acting is deserving of praise, and Taron Egerton did an exceptional job with the singing as well (I swear, he'd better get an Oscar).Overall a really good movie.

885,sadpeopledotcom,"A stunning and dazzling cinematic marvel, and nothing less.",10,19 June 2019,"Let me start off by saying that if you are a fan of Elton John, this movie is an absolute must-see. I walked into the theatres to see this movie not really knowing what to expect and simply adoring John's music, but I left completely blown away. I can say with complere confidence that this movie is like nothing I have ever experienced in a movie theatre before. John's music is used to portray his struggles and joys and his life from when he was a young child in a manner that can only be described as whimsical and dazzling. It is beautifully eye-catching and tells the story and struggles of Elton John fantastically. Additionally, this movie does an incredible job at portraying the raw and brutally dark emotions that Elton went through in his life and how huge his demons he had to overcome were. This movie does not hold anything back and is really all-in when it comes to emotion and darkness. It is ""R"" for a reason. Be warned. In a tragically beautiful sense it spins John's woes and defeats to the tunes of his songs we are all too familiar with, putting new spins and orchestration on them to allow us to see them in new lights and show how dazzlingly defeated John became during his early and breakthrough years with drug and drink. Finally, I can't go without mentioning Taron Egerton. Give this man an Oscar. He masterfully portrayed the singer, gaining both a spot-on match in both looks, mannerisms, and personality. Going so far as to do all of the singing himself, Egerton is a shoe-in for an Oscar. In conclusion, Rocketman sparks to life and dazzles on the screen. It's like nothing you'll ever see, and if you are a fan of John and his music, it's a must-see. Be prepared for extreme emotion, and beauty and musical triumph the likes of which you've never seen.",Rocketman

891,inkstain-11867,Rocketman - that fuse ain't burning down,9,9 July 2019,"Rocketman, coming hard on the heels of Bohemian Rhapsody, makes a comparison between the two inevitable. Thank the gods that this one they got right.
Taron Egerton is - simply brilliant. He embodies Elton, and doesn't try to mimic him, even when he sings. Which is a good thing because his singing voice is different to Elton's - not as strong for one thing - and had he tried to match that it would have sounded forced. He sings in a way that's true to his own voice and that works really well.
As much as I admired Rami Malek's dedicated take on Freddie, it always felt like a caricature. The humongous teeth, the fact that he he seems so much smaller , it just felt so cartoonish. The only saving grace the movie had was the music.
In Rocketman the story telling device used (thank the stars it's not another Dewey Cox 'I'm having a flashback before the show' affair) and that fact that it's unabashedly a musical works so well. Everything just gels. Both movies were at least partially directed by the same chap (in Bohemian Rhapsody Dexter Fletcher took over after Bryan Singer walked off) - and it goes to show what effect outside control has over the final outcome of a movie. Queen and Elton appear to have very different ideas about what they want said in their movie. Elton fought for the R rating and a near depiction of what his life really was back then (proper sex, drugs and rock and roll). And while Freddie's life must have been way out there, very little is depicted in the film, which is more a vehicle for the music of Queen than an actual biopic.
It's been a while since Elton was putting out new music all the time and you tend to forget what an absolute star he is. At 72 he is still a tour de force at the piano - you only have to watch him in that now famous duet at Cannes with Taron (Tiny Dancer). Taron can sing but Elton, hoo boy, that's proper star power.
Roketman is one of those movies that I could have just kept on watching, for as long as the music lasted.",Rocketman

Taron was singing right throughout and delivers very emotional and heartfelt scenes. If your not into musicals you may not get overjoyed by it, but if you can understand that this was a great way for him to incorporate his songs into certain times in his life, you will enjoy it. It's raw, not politically correct which I love and there's a love scene between himself and his manager, it's an important part in his life and his first love, I loved BoRhap but if these two movies were lined up side by side for best Oscar actor and picture this wins hands down for me.",Rocketman

I have been a fan of Taron and Elton's for years, so obviously i was very excited when i heard Taron would star as Elton in this movie. I had thought this I had went on opening night with my grandmother and i was immensely impressed. This movie makes you realize what it feels like to be human. It takes you through many emotions, making you really see how hard life can be. The movie makes you laugh, and it makes you cry. Watching Elton's life, and seeing how much he struggled with various things make you realize how the world can be. His struggle with drugs and other substances, and then him getting help in the end makes us all think that we can and will get through our hard times. Elton and Bernie's relationship is one i think we all envy. along with their relationship, they struggle sometimes, which does happen in real life. Though yes Rocketman is a musical movie, its not really a musical. if you don't like musicals i'm not sure why you would even go to a movie like this. The musical aspect made it feel surreal, which is how it felt to Elton. For instance. I view the Pinball Wizard scene as somewhat confusing, but that's also how it was for Elton. When he tries to kill himself twice, we get a sense that everyone is human, no matter how much of a god we make them out to be. Over all i would recommend that everyone goes to see this movie. It makes you realize what life is really like, and make you feel unreal oddly. This movie truly makes you feel almost dumb. Its like you cant even comprehend how amazing it is.

900,argyroschrysafis,"Good performances , but too obvious who was responsible for the production",4,29 August 2019,"Simple as that .. a movie showing how Elton John would like to present us his life , with intentionally self- made indications of hiswild life (?) , I wonder what Rolling Stones or Bowie have to say about that . His actual issues as the movie continuously and boringly indicates was mostly anger and depression because of his childhood which is acceptable and understandable but again why wanting to present a rock persona of abuse as u prove yourself as an excellent artist and crazy performer all those years. Why to try look as the bad wild rock star. Anyway this is a story that seems to be a musical E.J never managed to do , instead of really ""talking"" to the spectator and substantially living -with his audience -his actual life achievements and milestones .. Tagor's performance is the only thing that keeps you on the screen",Rocketman
901,FrankMovieReviews,"Musical during the crazy times, not a biopic",8,6 September 2019,Rocketman is an excellent biopic of Elton John's life during the 1970's & 80's - not a linear biopic - but instead it is a musical presented in a way to show the most significant events in Elton's life during the 70's and 80's.

912,justinotero,Great Movie with alot of crazy plot,9,13 December 2020,"In the movie Rocketman Taron Egerton plays Elton John, and in my opinion, he performs it very well. With songs like ""Your Song"", ""Something About the Way You Look Tonight"", and ""I'm Still Standing"", Elton John is still a quite interesting man, both stage persona and personal life, and the period that is primarily focused on is a very compelling one and worthy of being told on film. During the movie you will be taken from the start of his music career when he was a little boy, to the age of him being an adult having to face what he believed he threw away.I do wish they focused a little more on stuff that was going through his mind when things were going well, as they mainly focused on the bad or when he was cheated or walked away from deals. I do understand why they wrote the movie the way that they did but I feel that Elton would have had more to say and really enjoy his life when things were going smoothly.Some of the other films that did this style of explaining their story right was ""The Dirt"" about Motley Crue. As their story is a paced a bit differently as the transitions were done through going to place to place rather than through song, like in Rocketman I tended to enjoy ""The Dirt"" better.With Rocketman's way of explaining Elton, they showed a very good angle that most of us did not know about with the whole family destruction of him be open with his love life and then still barely being accepted at the end when he is in what I believe an AA meeting to discuss what he expected.A couple good points to add is the scene with the party house after the first concert or show which ever you would like to call it. The film direction and viewing of the camera was amazing him singing while you get to see that raw emotion while the background describes what is happening in the house is really all that you could ever ask for in a shot like that.Finally when finishing the movie you want to see more and without giving you a chance to they end it and you have to go and do your own research of what is going on now in his life which is still cool since Elton and Taron were friends even before he played him in this movie which is always very nice.",Rocketman

I really liked main character acting, but also ""the villain"" are well outlined.
Very good all around performance, I liked how songs pointed out single moments in Elton life.
I recommend this film to everyone, just keep in mind that is not a real rockstar biopic or Bohmian Rhapsody.",Rocketman
915,stark-79038,This movie will launch you into orbit!,10,2 May 2021,"Spoiler Alert. This is no candle in the wind. Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John in Rocketman will launch you into orbit with its seamless transitions from Broadway musical to full blown drama. The music guides you in and out of darkness. Rocketman is a film about redemption, asking for help, self-realization of shame, and learning that life is about being a good person. Through hard work and perseverance anyone can change. Rocketman is a revealing and gripping film about Elton John's life and the masterminds behind his songs. Similar to Bohemian Rhapsody, this film is big, brash, and reveals the pain suffered by a musical legend.Taron Egerton is brilliant as Elton John. He performs all of the music and embodies Elton's stage presence with intensity. The movie begins with a winged creature donning horns busting through a door and walking down a dimly lit hallway. At the end of the hall is another set of doors that are opened to reveal Elton John in a bright orange costume bedazzled with sequins and feathered wings. Elton has walked into a self-help group. The film is set during Elton's recovery and throughout the film there are elaborate flashbacks to his youth, adolescence, stardom, and adulthood. Not every flashback is traumatic. In fact, there are two gripping love stories that occur throughout the film.Meet Bernie Taupin played by Jamie Bell. Bernie is a songwriter that has been paired up with Elton. The two men hit it off from day one and throughout their music, form a deep love and respect for one another. Bernie hands Elton the lyrics to Your Song and watches Elton as he composes the music. This scene is a powerful representation of their platonic love for each other. This also is a stepping stone for Elton, learning that he is capable of loving and is deeply loved by Bernie. The next love story is the journey of Elton learning to love himself. This becomes apparent during a pool party scene. As he walks out to a party at his home, Elton is surrounded by every part of his life, drugs, alcohol, friends, family, industry executives, etc.; yet, he is miserable and life as he knows it has spiraled out of control. As he throws himself into the pool, a very slow and sad version of his song Rocketman, for which movie is titled, begins to play. At this time we see a young Reginald played by Kit Connor, dressed in a space suit, playing piano and singing at the bottom of the pool. Elton and young Reginald sing a brief duet while at the bottom of the pool signifying innocence and redemption. The scene is interrupted by loud crashes of splashing water as party goers dive into the pool to pull Elton out. As he is being taken to the surface, the sound of a reckoning begins. Powerful and hopeful music begins to play alerting the viewer that Elton has realized he can be loved and needs help.Elton's journey to rehab is not a walk down the yellow brick road but in a yellow cab (pun intended). Throughout the rehab scenes, Elton sheds pieces of his costume (the imposter) and quits hating himself. In the end Elton is able to give Reginald the hug and love that he has always wanted and deserved. Elton has determined his future life and proves to himself and the world that he is still standing...better than he's ever been!",Rocketman
916,zshapooks,I Just Want To Give This Man A Hug...,10,22 July 2021,"I loved it. I thought it was amazing. I sang along...I laughed...I cried. My heart went out to the boy he...was always 'a boy' who wanted nothing more than to be loved but gave us all a very big gift of his talent..his music. I loved the theatrical way it was expressed. I wasn't sure what to make of it at first then fell in love with it. I just know that my heart went out to him all the way through...to the very end. I'd wanted to reach through the screen...give him a big hug...tell him that he had value and worth and tell him that I loved him simply for his existence and how he touched my life throughout 51 years. I'd wanted to express my gratitude for bringing joy into my life as well as being there through the sorrow. The music of Elton John came into my life when I was only 7 years old and I have never stopped listening...feeling his lyrics, music. When I was in 5th grade I entered an art contest and chose the cover of the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album and I won. I wish I had it today it could not be returned. I hope the boy he was yesterday and the man he is today does read my review to know that he has touched other people's lives and has made a difference bringing joy to many. We cannot be responsible for the actions of others (parents) we can only be responsible for the actions of ourselves. Although both of your parents were horrible people it was because of that that you are who you are today...a beautiful, amazingly talented and gifted storyteller...loved by millions. You were always loved (fans) perhaps you just didn't have awareness.",Rocketman
917,jessepippen,"What you want, plus so much more!",10,21 May 2019,"It's everything you would want from an Elton John bio pic and so much more! The trailers hide the fact that this indeed is a full on musical. Not just Elton singing his hits, but the people around him and in his life from childhood to adult hood, all singing. They do this all while beautifully fitting his songs into his life story. I think you do not have to be an Elton John fan to like this movie as the musical numbers, comedy, and emotional beats are spot on perfection! This truly puts Bohemian Rhapsody to shame on so many levels, the most important of which; the lead actually sings in this one and sounds amazing. It sounds cliche, but I truly thought on multiple occasions Taron Egerton was Elton John himself, I was truly impressed with him. I can not recommend this movie enough.As I did see this at an early screening, my biggest complaint is I have to wait 2 weeks to see this again.

I've seen in years.Taron is absolutely amazing in this, please give him an Oscar immediately! The supporting cast are all outstanding too though and just make the story even better.There are 4 musical moments of brilliance in this film, in my opinion...Saturday nights alright, your song, crocodile rock and pinball wizard. All of which made me want to go to watch Elton live or just listen to the songs non stop.I also had no idea what struggles Elton John went through and it was quite emotional at times (again Taron made these scenes!).I wasn't expecting this to be so much of a musical spectacular and I could watch it over and over again!

923,tyler-san-615-571599,Raw and honest,9,22 July 2019,"I rarely review films but I really wanted to share my views on this.
The legend of Elton John presents him as a difficult diva with substance abuse issues, the film does not shy away from this but it shows the human side of his behaviour and the causes. From an over indulgent Granny to indifferent parents (although his step Dad came across well). Any child growing up in this environment would struggle, add the fact he was hiding his sexuality made it doubly difficult.
The film portrayed Elton honestly (I loved the foot stamping), it was sad to see how the drugs affected him, but heartwarming to see the loyalty of his good friend Bernie.As a teenager in the 1980's, I found the song 'I'm still standing' a bit annoying, because I didnt get it. Now I do.Please don't compare this film to Bohemian Rhapsody, because its not the same. Enjoy it for what it is,Tarron Eggerton is amazing and his voice is surprisingly good",Rocketman

The music is excellent and the timing of its usage is where the real emotion is. Taron is completely believable as Elton and portrays the flamboyant star like no one else could. He owned the role like malek owned Freddie and the story doesn't hold back on Eltons sad relationships with hie mother and father in childhood and in later life. Ultimately uplifting it does contain some tear in the eye moments.
Well i thought so anyway.",Rocketman
928,nancy-d-liu,Such a great movie!,10,6 June 2019,"Taron Edgerton is amazingly talented at both singing and acting; the true MVP of this movie. He captured the fun and serious tones of the film perfectly.You DO NOT need to be an Elton John fan to enjoy this movie. I wasn't much of a fan going into the film but I came to really appreciate his life's story. I was captivated right from the beginning through the performances of each actor and remained interested for the full movie. Despite the slightly longer runtime, the film's pace was great and never seemed to drag.I don't even usually enjoy musicals but the song choices and segways into the musical portions made sense in the film and were not too long/gratuitous.All in all, a wonderfully done film featuring a great cast that shows a side of a legend we've never really seen before.",Rocketman

930,cosmofever,Entertaining but chronologically inaccurate,8,23 January 2020,"Solid acting and singing, however chronologically I found the film quite confusing. It ends with Elton John performing ""I'm Still Standing"" upon his exit from rehab - however that song came out in '83 while the end credits say he's been sober for 28 years - so from 1990. The ending also suggests he has fired John Reid which happened neither in '83 nor in '90 but in 1998.While the costumes and actual live performances aimed at being 100% accurate, I would say the movie is loosely based on his life and is in no way a true biopic.",Rocketman

932,bellakaye-68,From Dazzling to Disappointing,3,1 June 2019,"I love good movies, in general, even if I am not a real fan of the subject matter. Although I wasn't a real fan of Queen's music, I disagreed with those critics that disliked Bohemian Rhapsody and thought the film and especially the lead performance set the bar high for rock bio-pics to come. The recent award season confirmed my opinion. Rocketman was a film that had a few brilliant dazzling theatrical moments that held out hope for the rest of the movie, but they pretty much fizzled and died. There was some wonderful choreography. Taron Egerton was wonderful as Elton John in the performance scenes, where he did his own singing, but somehow seemed less than believable as the singer in most of the other scenes. I went back and watched a number of news clips and just did not see any of John's individual mannerisms that mark each individual so clearly. This was something Remi Malek mastered spectacularly as Freddie Mercury. It was missing from Edgerton's performance, Elton John certainly has some distinct mannerisms.
The movie itself was problematic for me. It seemed like a form of self adulation since Elton John himself was an Executive Producer. Too much of of the movie was spent dwelling his problems and his therapy in rehab which quite frankly was boring because it's a story we hear repeatedly in the media. Millionaire celebrities with drug, alcohol or depression going into rehab, trying to kill themselves because they were unloved as children. It wasn't worked out or acted well enough to dwell on. The movie at best was uneven. It was however really good that John's brilliant lyricist Bernie Taupin finally had an opportunity to shine in the limelight. Although the Elton Johns music has always been very good, in all his top songs its always been Taupin 's poignant lyrics that raised that music from very good to great.",Rocketman

934,johnny-cuz,I so wanted to love this movie but sadly I didn't.,4,22 June 2019,"I've been an Elton John fan most of my life. My love for the music of Elton and Bernie literally shaped who I am. So I REALLY wanted to love this movie but I left the theater irritated and disappointed.My biggest gripes were:
1.) Some of the musical numbers were corny and out of character (e.g. young Elton dancing through the streets, acting tough and singing ""Saturday"". The young Elton John actors/singers were not very good either.
2.) The ""fantasy"" aspects and creative liberties taken to distort facts were annoying. For example, the scene at the Troubadour. It was corny having Elton and the audience flying but I get that the filmmakers wanted to communicate that the concert was a surreal, life changing evening for everyone there. What made me MAD is that he was playing Crocodile Rock! That was absurd. He and Bernie didn't even write that until '72. Plus, that song is NOT why people would have been blown away with him performance. It's a catchy little ditty that got great airplay but is not one of the songs that make Elton & Bernie great. The real set list for the Troubadour was songs like ""Your Song"", ""Border Song"", ""Take Me to the Pilot"", ""Burn Down the Mission"". That's the amazing stuff he played that night that rocked people's worlds. Not radio pop ""Crocodile Rock"". I don't see how any real Elton John can be happy with that gross distortion of facts. How about him playing part of ""Sad Songs"" for Dick James in 1969? What? That song, one of their worst commercial pop songs, was written in '83. Decades after that scene. Do the filmmaker's think we are stupid? That's not fantasy - that's just wrong!
3.) The majority of the movie was about Elton's struggles with drug/alcohol abuse, sexuality/relationships, and Mommy & Daddy issues. While it was interesting to learn about him as a person, other than some great scenes about his early days writing with Bernie, there was almost nothing about the music and how it was created. The fact that he and Elton and his band (Davey Johnstone, Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray, Ray Cooper and others) recorded dozens of great albums in cooperation with producer Gus Dudgeon and arranger Paul Buckmaster and that the band performed thousands of concerts was completely omitted from the film. In fact, the movie suggested that Elton didn't enjoy performing concerts. Like the only reason he was there was because his manager propped him up and forced him onstage. Really? Elton must have spent a huge amount of time writing, recording and performing during the first decade of his career. Was he really a wreck who was constantly wasted and feeling sorry for himself the whole time? Were there no happy moments writing music, in the recording studio, onstage? If not then I feel I have wasted my time being a fan all these years. I thought he actually liked the music but the movie suggested that once he became famous it was all about sex, drugs and depression.Were there things I liked? Sure. I really enjoyed the depiction of the early days in Elton and Bernie's relationship and particularly loved the scene with Elton writing the music to ""Your Song"". The Elton/Bernie relationship was well represented throughout the movie and the acting/singing of Taron Egerton was superb. Jamie Bell was fantastic. It made me like and admire Bernie even more than I already did. The recreation of scenes like Elton's childhood home, the Troubadour, Dodger Stadium, etc. were really well done with a ton of attention to detail. Which made it even more irritating that the filmmakers thought it was OK to distort other facts like claiming the Elton's last name was inspired by a picture of John Lennon. Sure, that would have been nice but they rewrote history. Elton has documented that it was because he liked Long John Baldry. Why change well documented facts? That's not being ""fantastical"" - that's just lying.",Rocketman

Elton's music is used with great effect in every scene and the whole movie combines heartbreaking emotion with scenes of pure joy.

This is an attempt to be both and without warning. Other great stories about those that made the largest cuts into our music then, now and forever dove into the story of the artist.This, again without warning, mimics the muppets movie while it tries very hard to tell Elton John's story by using his music to move the story forward. Giving the impression that we are not allowed to know how, why and when he created the music so many of us know.If you want a rated R version of Elton's life but one without an actual story, this is for you. You will catch glimpses of his journey, but without the substance that should be with it.Dancing in the streets with homes being pulled apart while strangers in the background breaking into song and dance as well is constant.

947,meganed01,"A stunning film, about a stunning man",7,12 June 2019,"Rocketman was an instant launch for success! It contained amazing visuals and really captured the heart and soul behind every song. Rather than being a film which only focused on Elton's music, it was a film about an individual, an individual who struggled with addiction, mental health and being accepted. Through out the film, Taron's portrayal of Elton was captivating and kept you drawn to the screen, with his ability to normalise this extravagant figure.
The music written by Bernie Taupin assisted the narrative, and gave depth to each scene. Rather than watching a biopic, it felt more like you were witnessing a piece of theatrical magic where with each song the audience were drawn closer to Elton and his story.
However, on the other hand I chose to rate it 7, because personally I believe some scenes could have been developed and furthered, to create a sense of fluency through out the narrative, rather than the constant flashbacks which were not placed in effective parts of the narrative.
Overall, personally, I would recommend everyone to watch Rocketman; it effectively tackles some serious issues which should be discussed more frequently. Furthermore, I would recommend that everyone should watch this film even if one might not be a fan of Elton John. This film will definitely make you sing along to every tune, and make you want to rock with some crocodiles!",Rocketman

949,gasshack-938-818742,Paid for the rental and watched 30 minutes and quit,1,31 January 2020,"Let me start by saying I really like Elton John's music. This movie however was a waste of my time. After seeing Queen (the Freddie Mercury movie), I was excited to see the story of Elton John. Being that it was a musical ruined everything. I just wanted the story of Elton and to see what made him into the man/entertainer he is today. I guess I was so blown away by the Queen movie, I wanted more of the same. This musical of Elton was a serious letdown.
Don't get me wrong, if It was called ""Elton John The Musical"", I would have never rented it. However I may have paid a couple hundred dollars to see it live on stage.",Rocketman

Though, That's not a good justification for the movie, It could have been better indeed.
In comparison with ""Walk The Line 2005"", I wasn't a fan of johnny cash either, but the movie was so good that I became a fan of Cash. It even encouraged me to listen to the singer's legacy.
Unfortunately, after watching Rocketman, I was not even eager to do the same.In conclusion:
Walk The Line is Good for fans and non-fans.
Rocketman Maybe only good for some of his fans.",Rocketman

I can't tell it was going for a movie about Elton John or going to a premier of a concert where Taron singing and performing and telling his life story from the screen (or from the stage cause it's a premier). His voice is precious, is emotional and is skillful. He got that powerful voice yet that soulful and soft that I am sure that he is the right person, the PERFECT person for those songs and for this film. Such a perfect actor, with a gifted voice.
His acting was outstanding and his eyes told things. I can felt his thoughts and feelings, his sadness, disapointment, his emptyness. Just, breathtaking.
And Jamie Bell did great, Richard Madden also, such a wonderful compilation of these three talented and professional actors.
Love their charisma and their chemistry together. Thank you very much for a great movie. Really enjoyed it.",Rocketman

966,aliciagkg,Taron Egerton is unbelievably amazing,8,25 June 2019,"I loved this movie. It was a unique and creative way to do a biopic and I really felt like all the images were straight out of Elton John's mind. I felt as if the whole film was based on how Elton John felt about himself and everything he went through. Fantasy was such an amazing genre choice for the film.
I've been a Taron Egerton fan for the past five years. I've followed his career since the first Kingsman and I've always loved him. When I saw ""Eddie the Eagle"" I was so impressed by how he managed to completely alter his appearance and capture Eddie's mannerisms so incredibly well. Taron blew my mind in ""Rocketman"" as well. There's no denying his insane talent and ability to capture Elton John's persona. His singing was fantastic as well. I'm so impressed by the lengths he went to to make his performance shine. I feel so proud to be a fan of his.
Overall, ""Rocketman"" is exactly what an Elton John biopic should be. I hope it isn't forgotten when awards season rolls around. It deserves all the attention and praise it's getting. Beautiful cinematography, great performances by everyone, and a very moving script. This film is a triumph.",Rocketman

968,evelynette,I want to see it 5 more times,9,3 June 2019,"I've just gotten home from seeing Rocketman for the second time, and I felt like I Had to write a review. It's my first one so bear with me....Wow. I haven't had this good of a time in a while. It's also been nearly 10 years since I felt a desire to go see a film twice (or thrice, or four times...)
This movie is MAGIC. It feels like you're watching a stage musical. It feels like it's actually happening right there, and you're in it. You can almost touch the glitter. You can feel your seat shaking to the music.Now, as everybody and their mums are saying, this is no standard biopic. Rocketman is very theatrical, it's very grand and very dramatic. It's very much a story with a big s. It would work just as well if Elton John was a fictional character. It isn't realistic. I'm well aware that this was the filmmakers' exact intention. And my gosh, does it work!I'm no expert on Sir Elton or his life, but I do know that this film is exactly how he wanted his story to be told. It is a fantasy. There's dance numbers and overdosing montages. There's a kid playing piano on the bottom of a swimming pool. It might not be what everyone likes, but here's the thing. All the song numbers and fantasy elements are perfect for conveying the emotions, the exhilaration, the lust, the hatred, the heartbreak of Elton's journey from a music-loving kid to a worldwide sensation. I've sure as hell never played the piano in front of a crowd, much less in a hip club in LA, but when Elton made the crowd (and himself) float during Crocodile Rock, I could imagine how he felt. I was floating with him.Of course, I couldn't possibly praise this movie without mentioning Taron Egerton. He is unrecognizable. I actually forgot this is the same guy from Kingsman. From the first shot he had me in his grasp. He made me feel every emotion with him, and no matter what his Elton said or did I was always on his side. And dear lord, his voice! I have to say I actually prefer a lot of Taron's renditions to the original EJ songs. He made them his own while still being faithful, and sounds extraordinary doing so. Very charismatic. I hope I'll hear him sing more.There wasn't a single bad performance in this film, but my favorites besides the lead were Kit Connor as pre-teen Elton, who was absolutely charming and I hope to see him in future projects, as well as Charlie Rowe as Ray, who brought in such wide-eyed enthusiasm and positive energy I was sad when his character wasn't seen again.There's so much more I could talk about (and that's a testament to just how much I loved this film), but I don't want to make this a 10 page essay. So I'll finish by saying if for some reason you're reading this but haven't yet seen Rocketman, I Urge you to do so. You will like it even if you don't care about EJ. I promise. I still want to go see it for a third time, but I think I'll wait for the blu-ray. The release date can't come soon enough. Me (and my neighbors) are gonna enjoy the soundtrack on repeat while I wait.",Rocketman

Contrary to the critic reviews such as Rolling Stone, a series of great Elton John songs and fun costumes do not make a movie. I wish they hired some good writers to explore (1) Elton's creative process with Bernie Taupin; (2) develop the characters for his parents; or (3) his four year marriage.

Blew me away.The lights came up after the movie was finished and credits were rolling, but I was so breathless I had to sit still in my chair for another five minutes just to catch my breath and get my wits back.And I'm not saying it was the all out best movie ever, but seeing it in theaters, yes it almost definitely is the best in-theater movie ever.",Rocketman

Taron Egerton nails it completely in the lead conveying his egocentricities, yet vulnerablities, and flamboyant style while Jamie Bell (who is undoubtedly coming of age in his recent roles) is excellent as the words behind the songs, and 'brother' Bernie Taupin.
And Bryce Dallas Howard recognisable as cold hearted mum Sheila.

This film made me feel so much that I want to tell everyone about it. Go see this film. This movie is so perfect and energetic and beautiful and epic and incredible and soaring and sad, yet it leaves you on such a high note that you'll be listening to the soundtrack for days afterwards just to feel a semblance of what this movie made you feel again. It's a movie about Elton John, yes, and an incredible portrayal of him and the soul of his music while at the same time adding something completely new and different to it, but it's also about choosing to get help when you need it in the darkest, lowest moments of shame and addiction and about what music can do and how it can make you feel. This movie isn't like other music biopics that almost entirely rely on the lead performance. This film has personality and energy that'll having you thrumming (on top of a career making performance by Taron Edgerton who fantastically does all of his own singing), but this film is first and foremost a film, and a great one at that. The way they incorporate Elton John's songs into the narrative and sometimes slightly alter them to make them fit the emotion of the situation is amazing, and they even do an incredible job of choosing Elton John's iconic outfits to fit the context of the scenes. I just honestly want to tell you every little great thing about this movie, but to save time I will instead spare you a mile long review to simply say: do yourself a massive favor and go and see this film.",Rocketman

I think it's a vastly superior film (emphasis on 'film' as opposed to straightforward biopic) to the thoroughly disappointing Bohemian Rhapsody.

Bernie loved him, but called him out on things, same with his mum. He had a solid upbringing as far as I could tell from the movie - father was a good provider and worked hard, mum was caring but tough.. .possibly a bit dismissive but in no way abusive, grandma was a great support, and his step father seemed like a good man and role model.Was actually more interested in the Bernie Taupin story to be honest.",Rocketman

I have always loved Sir Elton John from the first song that I've ever heard. I was a grade schooler singing my favorites like Benny and The Jets and Crocodile Rock.

1012,funeralhomes,Poor Poor Rocketman,1,2 July 2019,"Well, you know the soundtrack is good, but you expect it to be performed by Elton John, not some high school musical rendition.You also know the story is about the most flamboyant entertainer of the time, an epic tale of sex, drugs, and rock and roll; but you don't expect it to only be the background in a one dimensional tale of poor, poor Rocketman, the most depressed, lonely, unloved music icon ever. This film is produced by Elton John, and I don't know why he felt it was necessary to make his fans suffer the same depression as he apparently was in his youth, but I actually resent him for it. This movie is as upbeat as Schindler's List. I realistically will never hear Elton John again without being annoyed.",Rocketman
1013,sjd-59276,FANTASTIC!,10,14 June 2019,"I will preface by saying that I love musicals. With that being said, this is literally one of the best movies I have ever seen. The music is great and I LOVE Taron's spin on it. It is incredibly moving, with the music perfectly placed to compliment the story. I have seen it twice & it was even better the second time around. The soundtrack is all I will be listening to for at least the next few weeks.",Rocketman
1014,simone_maynard,Gay sex scenes not needed.,9,9 July 2019,This was a great movie but would be better if the gay sex scenes were not there. There was no need for all that. Keep it family friendly.,Rocketman
1015,drlager,Loved it!,9,2 September 2019,"My only complaint is where it ends. I wish it would have shown more of his life after he got sober. Other than that, I thought it was excellent .",Rocketman
