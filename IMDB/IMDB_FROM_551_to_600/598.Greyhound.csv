0,SnoopyStyle,He is the Captain Now,8,17 July 2020,"During the early American involvement in WWII, the ""Black Pit"" refers to the Mid-Atlantic gap where Allied convoys are left without air cover. They are at the mercy of the German submarine wolfpack. Commander Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) captains the American destroyer USS Keeling, codenamed Greyhound, on his first convoy leading three other warships and many slow moving transport ships.Tom Hanks is our Jimmy Stewart. He is our everyman and that's why he is so effective. He's not a superhero or a super-fighter. He is a regular man of real internal strength and integrity. This movie is trying to be simple, realistic, and matter of fact. It mostly achieves it by not explaining the military jargon and allowing the audience to figure it out. My biggest issue is the sound design. It's trying too hard especially the whale noise coming with the German submarines. Quite frankly, they are the wolf pack and a wolf growl would fit better. I wouldn't even do that. Silence is more threatening. Another minor issue is the girlfriend. The scene is unnecessary and clunky. It's similar to Cast Away. At this point, he might as well try Rita Wilson. At least, that would be fun for them. Overall, Tom Hanks sells this stripped down war movie. He's the captain now.",Greyhound
1,Prismark10,Greyhound,6,13 July 2020,"Greyhound starring and written by Tom Hanks was meant to had been released in 2019. It got delayed to 2020. The Covid pandemic meant that it was bought by Apple for its streaming service.It does indicate that Sony Pictures did not have complete faith in the film.The movie is a stripped down version of C. S. Forester's novel The Good Shepherd. Forester knew how to write naval stories. Some of the tactical cat and mouse displayed here really does have a Forester feel about it.Hanks is not new to the World War 2 genre. This shares its DNA with Band of Brothers but there is a clear lack of character development and story here.Captain Ernest Krause (Hanks) is the commander of the US destroyer guiding the Allied convoy crossing the north Atlantic.They are attacked by a fleet of German U-boats and Krause has to evade them, protect the ships and sink the U Boats.It turns out that Krause is actually new to the job, but his inexperience is not much of a factor here. Krause knows his naval jargon and he has tactical nous.It is a small scale film with loud bombastic music. There is a lot of CGI here.The ocean is rough and grey with waves crashing into the ship. It was enough to make me feel seasick. However I have been on enough boats to know that when you are in rough seas, you certainly know it. Here everyone is remaining static when they should be bobbing up and down and sideways.Frankly there is something static and flat about Greyhound. It lacks the claustrophobia and tension of Das Boot. It is too much of a boy's own naval adventure, which is why you get a few glimpses of the sole female in the film.",Greyhound
2,claudio_carvalho,Battleship on the Big Screen,7,19 August 2020,"In the World War II, the rookie American Captain Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) is assigned in his debut to escort thirty-seven (37) Allied ships through the Atlantic to Liverpool on board of the destroyer Greyhound and commanding two other destroyers and one corvette. When they reach a spot out of the range of the air cover, they are successively attacked by German U-Boats along the next days and nights. Will the Allied vessels survive the German attack?""Greyhound"" is a film of war that gives the sensation of playing the strategy type guessing game ""Battleship"". The location of the U-Boats concealed from the Allied enemies trying to destroy the escorts and the convoy is engaging and entertaining, with great performance of Tom Hanks.

He is Captain Ernie Krause on the destroyer Greyhound as part of a group crossing the Atlantic in the early days of WWII. There is a dead zone where they have no air cover as planes can no longer fly across the Atlantic Ocean.10 minutes into the film we are at GQ and it pretty much stays that way until the end. What we know about Krause is that he has a girlfriend that would not follow him and marry him. (I'll be here waiting, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.) And he prays a lot. Even the bedtime prayers kids do, but his faith was placed in the background. Not as much fun as McHale's Navy, although they did slip in an F-word for which the sailor apologized for saying.

4,paul_haakonsen,This was spectacular...,8,10 July 2020,"Holy moly...Well, another amazing World War II endeavor notch on Tom Hank's belt. ""Greyhound"" was definitely an amazing movie. When I sat down to watch it, I didn't really believe it would be up there alongside with the likes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"", but it was. Oh yes, it was.""Greyhound"" is a very intense naval war movie, and it was just great entertainment from beginning to end. I particularly liked the way that the movie was filmed, because it felt very dynamic and action-packed, sort of like I was right there alongside the fellows aboard the Greyhound and could almost smell the brine in the air.I must admit that I was surprised to find that Tom Hanks himself was the screenwriter for ""Greyhound"", and hats off to him for this achievement, because this was without a doubt a very enjoyable war movie.The movie also had a great cast ensemble to boast, with lots of great performances from the actors in the movie. That definitely helped to add authenticity to the movie.Visually then ""Greyhound"" was just spectacular. I really liked the presentation of the movie and the way it was shot. There was so much activity and realism in the scenes that it most certainly had a great war movie feel to it.My rating of ""Greyhound"" is an eight out of ten stars. This movie definitely took me by surprise, and if you enjoy World War II movies - with a naval theme, mind you - then ""Greyhound"" is the movie you should sit down and watch. Quite entertaining and well worth the time spent watching it.",Greyhound
5,searchanddestroy-1,The enemy below.,7,8 September 2020,"This is an amazing film, no one can deny this. Tense, breath taking, with many details, maybe too much, that proves much research from the producers. But that's realism, we can't avoid this. And I don't even speak of the characters depiction. The only and main flaw of this movie is that it shows ONLY the American side and not the German. That's why I would prefer Dick Powell's THE ENEMY BELOW, or even BEDFORD INCIDENT, though for this latest showing only the US side too. But these oldies was less focused on the special effects, I admit it. Anyway, this movie which I comment today is awesome, no problem. One last thing, it's such a shame that this movie made for large screens has been deleted from this release and instead driven towards Apple technology: smart phones and other small screens. Such a shame. But to really appreciate it, you have to be a Navy buff, about technicalities related to war ships. A die hard one. John Farrow, the specialist of seas and war ships would have loved this one.",Greyhound
6,CinemaSerf,"A modern day ""Cruel Sea"" well worth watching.",7,19 March 2021,"There is a superb book written by Rear-Adm. WS Chalmers that describes, in considerable detail, the career of Adm. Sir Max Horton - the man who ended up commanding what was known (in the UK) as the Western Approaches - the crucial lifeline between the UK and her supply chains from across the world. Tom Hanks (""Capt. Krause"") is the captain of one such lifeline leading, for his first time, a convoy across the Atlantic with just three warships to combat the increasingly effective Nazi U-boat ""wolf pack"" strategy that enabled the torpedoing of the freighters in a coherent and effective manner. Hanks carries much of this film en seul; his efforts as the officer juggling the responsibilities of keeping his fleet safe whilst combatting the atrocious conditions the ocean has to throw at them result in a strongly delivered character in whom we can all too readily believe. Some of the visual effects are top drawer, too - particularly towards the end when the battle lines are drawn and engagement with the enemy provides us with an enthralling sense of suspense and jeopardy. Some of the battle effects are little too ""Battleships"" at times, but they do contribute well to the overall and effective sense of peril that was faced by these young, inexperienced, seamen on mission after mission. Aaron Schneider (and Hanks with his writing hat on) have done a good job immortalising in film what CS Forester had already, poignantly, written.",Greyhound
7,grantss,Exciting but basic,6,19 July 2020,"February 1942. The destroyer USS Greyhound, captained by Commander Krause, is the leader of the escort of a large Atlantic convoy. For 50 hours they will have no air cover, making them vulnerable to U-Boat attack. A few hours in their worst fears are realised: the convoy has been targeted by a U-Boat wolfpack.Based on a CS Forester novel and written by and starring Tom Hanks, this film had heaps of potential. From early accounts it appeared that it could be a Saving Private Ryan of the sea, due to its realism. Throw in the human drama element of a captain commanding his first warship, and lacking the confidence of his men, and surely you have the makings of a great film.Unfortunately, no. While the action scenes are exciting and the internal workings of the destroyer (commands, actions etc) are quite realistic and the special effects are excellent, the plot is pretty basic and not entirely plausible. It's just a straight action drama with some contrivances thrown in in order to keep the average viewer happy.Regarding the human drama element, there is none. There's no character engagement: Commander Krause's lack of experience does not feature and is not even mentioned until briefly near the end. The trailers had more backstory than the film! We are shown glimpses of his past but these have no bearing on the plot and are a waste of time.What this all results in is a film that is far too short (at 91 minutes). Hanks and director Aaron Schneider could easily have fitted in 20-30 minutes of character development and backstory, maybe showed their training, built up some tension regarding how Krause would handle the pressure of combat. Instead we have something which is reasonably entertaining but empty.",Greyhound
8,bombersflyup,Should have stuck with my original decision not to watch this.,1,22 July 2020,"Greyhound is entirely dull and lifeless.Didn't realize I had to be a naval expert to watch a film, totally at sea if you will. There's certainly nothing else here, Hanks doesn't bring anything to the role. Did they really do a death ceremony while in current danger... come on.",Greyhound
9,deloudelouvain,A bit repetitive but good suspense.,7,21 July 2020,"As entertainment I thought Greyhound was slightly better than 1917 for example. There's more suspense in this movie than in the Oscar winning war movie from last year. That said Greyhound is sometimes a bit repetitive without being boring though. If you're like me not a big fan of wild waters and the open sea then Greyhound will be more effective, there will be more suspense as the naval battles are quite impressive. Tom Hanks did another good job with his character, he's a guarantee for success. I'm still waiting to see a bad movie with Tom Hanks. The CGI's were well done and added to the suspense. I wished they would have filmed the German side as well, in the submarine for example. I think that was a missed opportunity that would have made this movie even better. But I'm not going to complain, Greyhound was entertaining for me. If you like movies like Das Boot give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed.",Greyhound
10,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Sadly unremarkable wartime yarn,4,2 August 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1942, at the height of the war, Captain Krause (Tom Hanks) bids farewell to his fiance Evelyn (Elisabeth Shue, in a role that amounts to seconds) and heads off to take command of a US naval convoy, that is vital to delivering supplies to allied forces. However, in a vulnerable area of the Atlantic sea, the ship is prone to attack from German U boats, of which one calling itself The Wolfpack, seems to have made its mission to destroy. Krause and his second in command Charlie Cole (Stephen Graham) must act with all their wits if they are to survive.Not content with dominating the worlds of electronic software and music, in recent times Apple has branched out into the world of streaming services, with their very own Apple TV+, of which I had to take out a subscription in order to access this latest Tom Hanks offering (and why not, if they could see a market opening?) After Christopher Nolan's well received and highly successful Dunkirk, director Aaron Schneider appears to have attempted to copy the template of that film, by making another war film constrained within (or just over) the hour and a half mark, rather than the sprawling, lengthy wartime epics of yesteryear. But while Dunkirk generated a palpable sense of tension and increasing claustrophobia, Greyhound just doesn't really work.The result can be described as little more than a standard, cookie cutter war yarn, just crammed with all the cliches and common tropes of film's past, without creating any truly effective set up or worthwhile character development (much the same as Wolfgang Petersen's similar film U-571 twenty years ago.) Hanks is well suited to this type of role, but he just sleepwalks through this, ending up looking as bored as the audience. The 12 certificate prohibits any raw Private Ryan style blood-letting, and instead we are left with grubby CGI that makes it look like more of a hack job.Like almost all war dramas, it recounts an important and worthwhile event in war history, you just wish it could have been done in a more original and striking war. On the back of this, I may have to wonder if that £4.99 a month is such a sound investment. **",Greyhound
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Jargon city.,6,19 July 2020,"'Greyhound (2020)' is a Tom Hanks penned war movie centred on real-life captain Krause as he spearheads an escort keeping several cargo and troop ships safe as they cross over to the UK and enter a body of water in which they can't have air support. The film is only loosely based on true events, with much more action occurring here than it did on Krause's real journey. Even so, the flick feels distinctly distant, its suspense and set-pieces almost all boiling down to calm-under-pressure commands and tiny bleeps on radar equipment. If you're a naval nut, you'll probably get a kick out of what seems like a highly realistic portrayal of WWII-era seamanship. If you're not, you'll likely feel bombarded by the unrelenting, repetitive jargon that the script throws your way. The cold, matter-of-fact feeling of the piece may suit its subject matter, but it doesn't do it any real justice when it comes to audience connection. It's constantly well-conceived but never massively entertaining, sometimes suspenseful but never all that compelling, occasionally sad but never truly affecting. There are snippets of character development here and there but most of what you see boils down to machines outmanoeuvring one another. Of course, it isn't bad. It isn't boring or contrived, for instance. It's just a tad bland and it certainly isn't as engaging as it ought to be. Its best moments are enjoyable and its worst are uninspiring. It's a decent effort. 6/10",Greyhound
12,Cineanalyst,Sunken,5,1 May 2021,"Aside from an introduction involving his girl back home (Elisabeth Shue providing a big name for a minor part) and moments involving his religious devotion--I mean, why bother pretending he's a fully fleshed-out character--Tom Hanks's Navy commander's sea voyage on the eponymous destroyer is at least a taut WW2 action flick at an hour-and-a-half runtime. There's plenty of evasive maneuvers and fighting back against U-boats. Lots of authentic-sounding jargon as Hanks barks orders and relays messages. Lots of Oscar-nominated bangs and booms. Lots of grey in the color palette to go with the title. It's beyond me, though, why Hanks decided to write and star in seemingly the same role he's been playing over and over again for years now--at least since ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998)--in a sea drama that, to not get out of the review without making sure to include one bad water-based joke--is kiddie-pool-level challenging. Is he merely this generation's Gary Cooper, the strong-silent type.I suppose its action-packed, effects-driven spectacle would seem to demand the theatrical big screen, but had I went to see it in an alternate world that wasn't shut down by a pandemic, I would've found it a waste of money and time. On the small screen at home with an AppleTV+ free trial, not so much. Involving enough but not so demanding that I couldn't snack simultaneously without struggle. Easily digested and soon to be forgotten, and that goes for the snacks, too.",Greyhound
13,secondtake,"Superb in its simple intentions, but a very simple, linear telling",7,19 July 2020,"Greyhound (2020)This is the easiest review I've ever written. Why? Because this WWII movie is so obviously good, well made, and linear. It goes from stating the problem quickly (merchant ships crossing the Atlantic with German subs in the waters out to get them) to illustrating the problem. The illustration, if you don't mind the word, is the movie.
And Tom Hanks is the movie, too, as the commander of a ship which is in charge of protecting the dozens of merchants ships filled with goods and oil and such heading for England. The Germans are many, relentless, and evil (they tease their enemies of the radio). Hanks, an older man in his first mission of WWII, is thoughtful, religious (old-school Christian), and very smart. He generally succeeds. They get past the dark zone in the middle of the ocean to the other side and the safety of air support.
That's the movie. There might be a spoiler in there, but you deserve to know that the movie will not succeed by surprising you, or pressing you to think, or by any manner of approaching the war in a new way. It's a war movie that does in fact succeed, I have to remind everyone, by simply being so well made. And by having the veritable Hanks at the center of every scene, every scene.
It races through encounter after encounter, with small heroes in the crew and one large hero at the helm. There are lots of hard turns to the left or right (the rudder is sturdy) and some mishaps and despair, but the real thrust is action. Boats, submarines, depth charges, radar (which was just developed in 1939, so is brand new for this moment), sonar (well developed by now), and torpedos, of course. It's great, exciting, and it never lets up. You have a true understanding of what it might have been like.
Kind of. Everyone writing about this movie wishes it had tried harder. And never mind the cheap insertion of sappy love interest Elizabeth Shue for ten seconds. Silly. But the rest of the movie, not silly. Good, easy movie.",Greyhound
14,851222,Good sea battle and nothing more,6,27 July 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Greyhound"" (2020) staring Tom Hanks is probably one my least favorite movies staring this actor. Its because this talent is one of the best ever, and this is material that does not require many human emotions nor deep characters - this movie is all about battles in sea. And for that i did enjoy it, but only for that. Sea battles were done good and kinda unique. And that is pretty much all this movie features - literally.Overall, ""Greyhound"" is a fast, short and nicely made flick about sea battle during WW2.

16,ops-52535,superb,10,10 July 2020,"I think even the least interrested in warfare subject will lend an eye to this film. its the story about convoys and their watchdogs, while being in the black pit or empty pit of the ocean where the german wolfpacks sets up for attack, due to the lack of airprotection of the convoy. there are some small historical glitches but thats on a minor scale of technicality.its a nonstop sonar pinging, full of dire commands on fatigued crews, wher the trampers and oiltankers flares up everywher, and very erratically. its full of special effect and sound, and the use of vfx and cgi are overwhelming, but faboulous.this is a film that has to be viewed in the cinema to get full purpose of light and sound.its a raw film about war at sea, how small and defenceless a human can be on the big grey stormfilled ocean. the acting are very good, tom hanks are in the midst of his favourite type of carachter, the score are at times a bit to loudy, so details in the dialouges are hard to hear, but its a noisy film anyway.if its a warfilm you would consider viewing as a virgin of warfare at sea, this will be a good place to start. highly recommend from the grumpy old man for its speed, action and relentlessness.",Greyhound
17,paulclaassen,What the bloody hell...??,1,14 August 2020,"So, this is the future of movie making. Location: studio. Everything else added in post-production via CGI. Whoopee, exciting... *add sad face here*...Much of the film's dialogue was beyond my understanding, so I just followed the action. The dialogue felt like a demonstration of maritime lingo. I even opted to watch the film with subtitles, and still I didn't understand much of what the hell they were saying. As a result I lost interest very early in the film. How many times do they actually use the words ""rudder"" and ""aye"" in this movie?? Enough already... *add annoying face here*...Speaking of following the action. My head was spinning from a sense of deja vu. I mean, deja vu, deja vu, deja vu.... This story could have been told in a 20-minute short film, yet the film runs for 90 minutes, of which the entire film is about a ship chasing after a submarine, then the sub chases the ship, then the ship chases the sub again... yawn.The visuals were clearly computer generated, like a dated videogame. Hence, I wasn't captivated by anything that happened here. It didn't feel real. It felt like the actors were partaking in a simulation. I didn't really care about any of the characters. None of them were fleshed out and we didn't know anything about them, so I never rooted for any of them. The only character with a bit of background was Captain Krause (Hanks), but still there was hardly any character development and about 50% of his dialogue was ""rudder left"", ""rudder right"", ""hard rudder"" or whatever.

The direction which was made by Aaron Schneider was very good and he did a great job without over doing it neither in the duration of the movie nor with any unnecessary scenes or information. The interpretation of Tom Hanks who played as Captain Krause was simply amazing and I believe that for one more time Tom Hanks did his best. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Stephen Graham's who played as Charlie Cole and Karl Glusman's who played as Eppstein. Finally, I have to say that ""Greyhound"" is a very good movie that shows the history behind Greyhound and the great job they all did to keep safe and save as many people as they could.",Greyhound

21,zkonedog,Solid Submarine Warfare Film (But Doesn't Rise Above That),7,17 July 2020,"Tom Hanks in a World War II-themed film is about a sure of a bet that Hollywood can make. In a large sense, that is exactly the case with ""Greyhound"". It's never boring, provides a different viewpoint of one aspect of the war I hadn't really known about, and of course Hanks is tremendous. This one may not go down as an all-time classic, though, if only due to the fact that the real emotion of the picture doesn't hit home until the final minutes.For a very basic overview, ""Greyhound"" tells the story of an Allied convoy of ships trying to cross the Atlantic to England in 1942. There's about a 40-hour window of time, however, in which air support cannot be given, thus leaving the fleet vulnerable to German u-boat submarines. The Germans do indeed show up, of course, precipitating a cat-and-mouse nautical battle with the lead ship (Greyhound) captained by Krause (Hanks).Perhaps the hallmark of this movie is how relentlessly it presses forward almost from the get-go. After a brief scene in which Krause says goodbye to sweetheart (and potential future wife) Evelyn (Elisabeth Shue), the action kicks in and never abates. Just when you think that Krause and his crew may be able to take a breather (and thus the viewer with them), events inevitably ramp up again. In what becomes a running motif throughout the film, Krause is brought multiple trays of food from the mess hall that never get touched due to some event or another. Instead, he subsists on coffee and guile.This never-let-up approach definitely has its pros and cons. On one hand, it really creates a sense of accomplishment or relatable fatigue towards the end of the film. Since the audience--much like Krause--is never able to catch its breath, we can relate to the emotions of the endgame. On the other hand, the constant motion leaves no time for much meaningful character development moments outside of Hanks' Krause himself. As such, the events can sometimes seem a little hollow if looked at from strictly a character-perspective.A great example of this are a few chilling moments where the German u-boat transmissions (meant to intimidate the Allies) are played over the loudspeakers. Those moments really caught me off guard and gave some needed depth to the proceedings, but in the overall style of the film are very short and perhaps gone too soon.Thus, ""Greyhound"" was very much a movie for me in which I only felt myself emotionally moved towards the very end, when the entirety/enormity of the situation could be felt. But that ended up being a little ""too little, too late"" to make this jump much higher than a ""solid 7/10"".",Greyhound
22,eddie_baggins,A well filmed but hollow experience,4,23 July 2020,"A passion project for its leading man Tom Hanks, who wrote the screenplay for this Aaron Schneider directed WW2 thriller, Greyhound is a film where there's a constant wave of happenings and events but this based on a true story tale feels like nothing more than a procession of repetitive occurences, that while well filmed and staged, lack any heart or emotional connection.Wasting little time establishing any form of genuine back story to characters or events leading up to the film, Schneider and Hanks get stuck straight into the action (going for an almost Dunkirk like vibe that disallows us any respite from what's occurring) as they introduce us to Hanks's naval Captain Krause and his ship The Greyhound, as it try's to escort a convoy of American ships across the Atlantic in the heat of WW2 to deliver supplies to England, a job made tough by the fact they are being hunted and taunted by German U-Boat submarines hot on their tail.Within the first 15 minutes of the film bombs are falling and bullets flying as Hanks and his almost ghost like crew that includes actors like Stephen Graham who deserved more material to work with, find themselves playing cat and mouse battles against the pursuing enemy but while initially this is fine and in many ways tense enough to hold our attention, as the runtime wears on and the action (which includes a lot of blipping radars and radio comms) stays constant but the characters unrefined and unexplored, there's little within Greyhound to hold onto or to care about as the proceedings push forward.Originally scheduled to play out at cinema's around the world later this year but bought by Apple's streaming service for a handsome sum, it does appear as though Sony dodged a financial bullet here with Greyhound riding off a purchase fee that covers it's mid-tier budget, as there's nothing here to suggest that audiences would've been clambering to buy tickets to the big screen to catch this film that looks the part but lacks significant energy to make it feel as though we've been short-changed getting to see this on our home screens.As per usual Hanks is his usual solid self, Krause feeling like a mix of his performance in Captain Phillip's with a little bit of Bridge of Spies thrown in but just like the rest of the film Krause feels like a half-explored at best element, we get a flashback to conversations he has with his wife, snippets of his religious faith and glimpses of his determination shown through the soles of his bloodied feet but you can't help but feel there was so much more for this film to delve into outside of its action focus.Final Say -What is an initially thrilling set-up quickly gives way to a film going through the motions, as Greyhound pushes forward towards its goal without so much of an afterthought for making us care about what is happening and who it is happening to.2 pairs of slippers out of 5",Greyhound
23,Red-125,Solid WWII movie,9,5 November 2021,"Greyhound (2020) was directed by Aaron Schneider. Tom Hanks wrote the screenplay and starred in the movie.Tom Hanks is Captain Krause, who commands a destroyer named Greyhound, and is also responsible for three other fighting ships. They are protecting a convoy of merchant ships trying to get across the Atlantic to England.Apparently you can't have a Hollywood movie without at least one beautiful woman in it. That woman is Elisabeth Shue. She appears as the movie opens, and Hanks thinks of her as the movie progresses.Rob Morgan portrays Messman Cleveland. Much is made of Hanks' bonding with Morgan. Unfortunately, the movie never makes clear that Black sailors were almost always messmen, cooks, or stewards in the segregated Navy.The plot contains non-stop action, as a German U-Boat pack attacks the convoy. The movie handled these scenes very well--the bravery, the fear, and the constant anxiety of everyone on the ship are well portrayed.Two things didn't make sense to me. One--I learned--was pure fiction. That was a German U-Boat commander being able to communicate with the Greyhound's PA system to issue boastful, fear-inducing statements. According to what I read, that just couldn't happen.Also, would a destroyer on convoy duty stop to have a long, slow funeral service for three dead sailors? That was a powerful scene, but I assume it was pure movie fiction.Other than those two lapses, I believe the movie was well executed and very compelling. It worked well on the small screen. Greyhound has a relatively low IMDb rating of 7.0. I thought that it was better than that, and rated it 9.",Greyhound

Probably never because he's older and really becoming a hack.This movie was allegedly going to be theatrically released but it doesn't look like a theatre movie. It has the look and feel of a direct to video film. It's seems really cheaply made. The ocean special effects look Chinese, if you know what i mean.

Lot's of close ups. And those Chinese ocean scenes.I was pretty bored. And in the end I have to say the film is really really sub par.

Then he starts blasting the submarines. Then he starts staring out in the ocean AGAIN for new Nazi submarines. Repeat. Repeat...The bad: there is NO dramatic devellopment whatsoever.

31,jtindahouse,No time spent building characters and the film suffers for it,6,22 July 2020,"I don't think I recall seeing a war film as short as 'Greyhound' before. It comes in at an astonishingly quick 91 minutes and a solid 10 of those are the credits. Even a lot of horror films overshoot that time these days. The short runtime is an odd thing in this case, because I was very glad that it was that short (I was pretty bored by the end), but also I suspect it would've been a better film if it was fleshed out a little more. The film is so intent on keeping an emphatic pace up, that it almost entirely negates any characterisation. There is a very quick flashback scene at the beginning to give a little bit of context to the main character, however even that feels extremely chopped on and like it was added in post-production.The film reminded me a little of 'Dunkirk' in that sense. Unfortunately it didn't have the filmmaking abilities of Christopher Nolan behind the scenes to cover up for it. The film chooses to rely very heavily on action and that's fine, but it's very hard to be remembered that way. And also, while the action was non-stop, it was also very repetitive. It kind of felt like we were just given the same sequence of events three times over.I often think if a World War 2 story is only just getting around to being told now, then it probably wasn't all that worthy of being told at all. I didn't hate this film by any means, I would just simply much prefer a war story that focused on the characters. I would take '1917' every day of the week over this film. 'Greyhound' isn't a film I will be quick to recommend to people. But if all you want is a quick action film to watch with some popcorn then you could do worse.",Greyhound

Its captain is an honest, hardworking, god bothering, sterotype. He'll give no quarter and fight till the end, against overwhelming odds.Now for the reality. The US suffered massive losses in the early days of merchant shipping. The U-boats had a free hand. Indeed, even when the US military started deploying destroyers and the like, to escort shipping, they had no idea how to counter their experienced German adversaries. To make matters worse, their proud admiralty were reluctant to take advice from the British, who had considerable experience dealing with the threat.The notion too, that German U-boats would sit openly on the surface, in defiance of a destroyer or send goading messages, is complete and utter nonsense. Its unfair too, to assume the Germans ""liked"" what they did. Most historical accounts showed they had considerable sympathy for the plight of the men whose ships they sunk. A fate they often shared.On the upside this film is entertaining for those who are oblivious to historical reality. Its paced well, has loads of action and as per usual Tom Hanks fits hand in glove, into his role. Their is no denying the mans acting credentials.

37,questl-18592,Meh-hound,6,20 December 2020,"A war movie starring Tom Hanks? Sounds like an Oscar candidate to me!Greyhound follows a fictional crew of a ship during World War 2 as it shepherds a series of merchant ships through a mired and treacherous sea.Hanks is Hanks, he doesn't really have bad days but Greyhound really comes down to weighing the pros and cons and finding myself riding pretty much at perfect equilibrium.The Pros! This may well be the most realistic naval battle movie ever. They really went for that strong sense of reality in this, wanting it to be less about the common war ropes and more about the actual dangers and tensions that take place when you're surrounded by enemies you can't see and could kill you at any time. This stress and tension is amplified due to the confined nature of the story because, with few exceptions, this is all taking place on the one ship over maybe a few days rather than being stretched out and diffused over a wider scope.The Cons! The filter on this movie looks weird to me. The water never looks quite right, as imposing as it is.It's pretty heavy handed with the religious stuff which is a bit eyerolly. Possibly the most overt issue is with the adversary. We only hear him a few times but each time it's a super over the top evil nazi accent that illicit images of him twirling his mustache and petting a Persian cat as he stalks this ship. It feels SO out of place in a movie like this. Now, all of that seems pretty minor but it kept me from fully investing and fully diving into the story, which was really frustrating to me.Conclusion! Greyhound is a solid, realistic seeming war movie with some solid performances but it's missing a bit of polish, a bit of that movie magic that prevents it from being truly spectacular. It also feels like it's going to get lost in a series of recent war movies from hat period. 1917, Midway, Dunkirk, all war movies that do similar things but, especially in the case of Dunkirk and 1917, do it SO MUCH BETTER! If you haven't seen those two, go watch them long before this but if you're looking to check out what AppleTV is offering, this isn't a bad showing from them, given how young that service is.",Greyhound

The Black Pit was the mid-Atlantic area where convoys could not get air coverage, being too far both from the US and the UK.

43,arungeorge13,"A decent outing for Hanks, but we've already seen better! [+64%]",6,11 July 2020,"What Greyhound lacks in character depths, it compensates in engaging naval battle action. Hanks himself has written the screenplay, detailing the 48-hour course of the titular destroyer, packed into an 80-minute flick. This film is more like a tribute to the Navy, with commands and cries overshadowing regular conversations. Hanks plays Ernest Krause, the commanding officer of the destroyer - once again, putting himself in a perilous situation while in transit (à la Cast Away, Captain Phillips, Sully, and Apollo 13).The effects work is quite solid and kept me hooked for the most part. There are few instances where Hanks has attempted to build connections between the members on board - Ernie's transparency with second-in-command Charlie Cole (Stephen Graham) and chef George Cleveland (Rob Morgan) is discernible; those few memorable moments get drowned out amidst all the shelling and rough waters. We also get a short flashback featuring Ernie and his girlfriend Evelyn (Elisabeth Shue) which, in another film, would have been a lot longer and something meatier.Once again, Hanks seems in his comfort zone, playing the (first-time) captain who commandeers a ship to safety. However, we rarely get to connect with Ernie as a character. The tense nature of the film overpowers its characters - you see a number of torpedos barely missing their mark, U-boats drawing in close, and Ernie missing his meals a lot. The bloodshed, similar to Dunkirk, is nominal for a war film. Even the major antagonist (a German commander) is only heard over the radio - his presence is never shown on screen. Most of the film takes place in the ship's crowded deckhouse.The cinematography by Shelly Johnson gives you the shaky feels of being out at sea. Occasionally, you get panoramic shots of warships and submarines battling it out. Music by Blake Neely neatly mounts pressure and adds to the dangers circling Ernie's ship and at times, underneath it. Greyhound is by all means worth a watch, but I doubt you'll be tempted to hail it as anything beyond ""good"".",Greyhound

I thought they were going to build some sort of bond between the captain and his Black cook, but that never got off the ground. We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.It's a difficult challenge to portray on film the battle between a destroyer and a submarine. This movie never really pulls that off, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. The German U-boats never seem to be part of the narrative. They try to bring the U-boats in with their radio broadcasts which come across more as obscene phone calls than viable dialogue.Almost exactly half of the dialogue is sailors repeating orders. It got very tedious, very quickly. I thought they went too far in the whole ""navy talk"" department.I found the U-boat attack theme music to be mostly bothersome and heavy-handed, like death wail of a fat man, or a runner-up in Dumb and Dumber's most annoying sound in the world.The sea burial onboard was a moving tribute to our military dead.

47,ketgup83,Tom Hanks Marvellous Act Sails The Ship In This Visually Appealing War Drama,8,12 July 2020,"For many folks, war drama is either serious, boring or preachy. But what if you get the chance to watch a war drama which is adventurous, action-driven and powerful, wouldn't you give it a shot ? Welcome onboard to Greyhound as this ship will take you a real-time adventure which is stunning and electrifying.Based on the The Good Shepherd by C.S Forester, Greyhound tells the story of first timer U.S Navy Commander, Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks), who must steer his merchant navy ship through the series of attacks by German submarine during the Battle Of Atlantic (in which convoys coming from North America and going to United Kingdom and Soviet Union were protected by British and Canadian air forces) in the year early 1942.Directed by Aaron Schneider, Greyhound takes no time and immediately swing into action which is full of surprises, shocks and pain requiring courage, honesty, discipline and sacrifice to perform your duty. Aaron Schneider sets the right context from the very beginning of the film infusing the adrenaline rush in you as the series of attacks begins especially after 10 minutes of the film.At this point there is no turning back as Aaron Schneider keeps the film engaging with nail-biting and tense moments until the evidence of first submarine burst with oil shows up on the sea. The threat continues as the German submarines, like a pack of wolves, begin surrounding Greyhound, which is desperately waiting for the air force to cover up. While the first half was filled with what-will-happen-next moments, the second half continues the momentum and delivers a knock-out victory as the US convey succeeds to sail pass through German submarines. The only cliche was the climax which could have made this movie an epic.While writing, also by Tom Hanks is witty, the highlight of the movie is the eye-popping cinematography by Shelly Johnson. Each and every frame is beautifully captured with perfect light and shadow. The art direction by Tom Frohling and Lauren Rosenbloom is excellent as it will make sure you are drawn into a war scene. Brownie points for the background score by Blake Neely for uplighting each scene with aplomb (might remind you of Dunkirk) and tight boxed-in editing by Mark Czyzewski and Sidney Wollinsky.Coming to the performance, it is Tom Hanks's stellar show all the way. The powerhouse of talent deep-dives into the character of Captain Krause as it was tailor-made film for him and the actor plays role to T. The supporting actors do justice to their part. Overall, Greyhound is an epic war drama which is filled with nail-biting moments that will surely give an adrenaline rush. Brilliant 3.5/5",Greyhound
48,Prashast_Singh,"Action-packed, fast-paced and exciting: Greyhound works the way it intended to.",10,25 July 2020,"Just finished watching it and there were times where I couldn't help but feel sorry for the entire team of Greyhound as they intended this movie for theatrical exhibition. The opening sequence alone conveyed this. The film has little drama, but is high on action and tension. There are very few pauses between the battles, and there were times I was on the edge of my seat. Greyhound had me gripped from start to finish, and its short running time was another positive.Tom Hanks spearheads this war-themed action film that hardly deviates from delivering explosive entertainment. The visuals are outstanding, and the special effects look impressive. Whether it's explosions, torpedo firings or just ships sailing with full intensity, Greyhound completely holds your attention, and it can be enjoyed for that alone. Performances coming from all actors are fine, although it's true that the camera seems to focus more on Tom Hanks' face, thus making him the first one to have his performance lauded.Director Aaron Schneider has delivered a much needed summer action blockbuster that entertains, thrills and leaves a strong impact. I was also fairly surprised when I read Tom Hanks' writing credits; he has done an excellent job at both writing as well as acting. And one more thing, the background score. It was really exciting and suspenseful at the same time. So, while I did feel bad that it couldn't make it to cinemas, I'm glad the makers of Greyhound not just embraced the new medium because they had to, but also because their content was strong enough to work anywhere.

50,bankofmarquis,Hanks does it again,8,11 March 2021,"HANKS DOES IT AGAINTom Hanks interest in the men who fought in WWII is well known. From his starring role as Capt. Miller is what is (arguably) the definitive film about D-Day, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, to his Executive Producing role in, arguably, the best mini-series ever produced about WWII, BAND OF BROTHERS, Hanks has brought a face to the nameless heroes who fought in the middle of the last century.Add his latest film GREYHOUND, to the list of films that brings a face to a heretofore unknown (at least to me) group of heroes.Based on the book THE GOOD SHEPHERD by C.S. Forester and adapted for the screen by Hanks himself, GREYHOUND tells the story of a Commander of a U.S. Navy escort ship, helping cargo ships cross the Atlantic Ocean - an Ocean filled with enemy submarines.Hanks, of course, plays Commander Ernest Krause, Captain of the USS Keeling, code named ""Greyhound"", who is on his first mission. As one might imagine, Hanks imbues Krause with a common decency and you inherently trust Krause's instincts as he makes split second decision after split second decision. What surprised me about Hanks in this role is his ""steely resolve"" in dealing with the problems. You can see his brain working as he makes pragmatic decision after pragmatic decision - sometimes not the most ""human"" decisions - but the right decisions after all.This is both the strength and the problem with this film - Hanks' character is NEVER wrong, so after awhile, the tension on the Bridge with Capt. Krause being questioned on his decisions, is never really there.But, that is a ""nit"" in this film for Director Aaron Schneider has constructed a taunt and tight thriller that is non-stop action from start to finish. He wisely decided to keep the film at a tight 90 minutes and keep the action flying (versus putting in a couple of ""character building scenes"" that could have stretched the runtime). He does shoehorn in a flashback scene between Krause and his lady love (played by Elisabeth Shue), a scene that is not really needed, but besides this he focuses his attention on the Greyhound and it's mission and this is a smart move that the film benefits from.Director Schneider relies, heavily, on the Special F/X recreating the Atlantic sea battles and, for the most part, it succeeds. BUT...from time-to-time I felt like I was watching a video game - and not a film. The F/X (at times) was just not feature film quality that drew me away from the emotion and the action on the screen.With the Global Pandemic, this film's theatrical release was cancelled and it was put on Apple TV+(where you can find it today), so I can forgive the lower F/X results...but just a little.All-in-all a fun thrill ride, with a terrific central performance, in a film that shows an aspect of WWII I had not previously scene portrayed on film before.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Greyhound

53,pietclausen,Acceptable watch,6,13 July 2020,Over the years there have been quite a number of films in this category. This one is based on a book and portrays how life was endured on convoy duty and the actions carried out to keep the ships safe from being destroyed or sunk by enemy submarines.This film may appeal to viewers to experience how difficult life really was with limited weaponry and technology. In the many Atlantic crossings many ships were lost. It was always a gamble whether you would reach your destination in one piece or perish. Tough times in 1942 for this captain making his first crossing.,Greyhound

55,kjproulx,"A Simple, Entertaining Action Flick",8,14 July 2020,"This is the type of movie that's hard to resist. When I originally heard the team behind Greyhound, I was intrigued, but very cautious as well. Tom Hanks, being one of the most likable and talented actors in the history of Hollywood (at least in my opinion), hasn't had that much success in terms of writing screenplays. From That Thing You Do! to Larry Crowne, I've never been all that impressed. Well, Greyhound is absolutely his best effort yet, but I also believe the fast pace of the movie helped the script out immensely.The premise of this film revolves around the fact that Captain Krause (Tom Hanks) is very inexperienced, but will stop at nothing to captain this ship to the best of his ability. On the hunt by U-Boats during World War II, he must make all the right decisions to prevent as many casualties as he possibly can. This entire 90-minute movie never stops moving. There are a couple of scenes that give some backstory to Hank's character, but this film is like Mad Max: Fury Road in the ocean. Not quite as impressive, but still a highly engaging piece of war filmmaking.Where I feel this film's biggest issues lie, is as I said, in the screenplay by Tom Hanks. While nothing in the script itself is bad, it's fairly hollow in terms of story. It's adapted from a novel that I have not looked into, so I can only assume this story is further fleshed out there, but the film version was very light on substance. Now, with that said, the quick dialogue that has characters constantly mumbling ship terminology to keep you engaged throughout each and every battle sequence is almost the perfect distraction. This film is about displaying a piece of war and nothing else. For that reason, I give the light and breezy script a pass.I would almost compare this movie to that os Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. That was a very simple film in terms of storytelling, but the overall experience held you to the edge of your seat. From Hank's devoted performance as always to a bunch of solid supporting characters who come in and out of the film to offer him wisdom or help, any minor dull moment is covered up. When I say this is a very hard movie to dislike, that's because any issues it has can easily be overlooked, due to the exciting nature of it all.I could sit here and say that there is too much CGI and there are a couple of instances where the ocean itself stood out to me as feeling very fake, but many viewers will not notice things like that. There are a few minor distractions throughout the movie, but the solid direction by Aaron Schneider and the pulse-pounding score by Blake Neely keeps this film from ever feeling slow. It's not perfect by any means and there's not much to take away from in terms of anything thought-provoking, but I had a really good time watching it. If you're looking for a light, exciting watch, Greyhound is now streaming on Apple TV+ and I think it's worth your time.",Greyhound
56,kuarinofu,Just a step away from being a good war drama,7,12 July 2020,"Greyhound looks great, sounds great, it is well-acted and has some dramatic moments, but it just makes me feel worse about the film since it was so close to becoming a good war drama, but it never reached that point. The film feels like it has that one detail missing - character development. There are characters and they are distinguishable and memorable, but there's so little to each one of them it almost doesn't matter.This film handles war much better than that comic book abomination 'Midway', but in the end, it just feels empty since it ends just so fast and without reaching the high note. There's basically no 3rd act. I wish it was more dramatic and character-driven with all the good looks it has and I wish I could see it in a theater.I rate this film 7, but it's much closer to 8 than a 7. If only it had more substance to support those visuals...",Greyhound
57,tm-sheehan,Perhaps better at the Cinema but not for me,5,10 July 2020,"I'll be honest War Movies ,especially American War Movies are my least favourite movie genre but saying that I scored Sam Mendes World War 1 epic 1917 a 10/10.
As Greyhound is not having a Cinema Release I can only judge what I see on a HD Television Screen I think if a movie is great cinema it will be obvious on any screen .
Tom Hanks, who wrote and stars in the film Greyhound, said it's ""an absolute heartbreak"" that the film won't debut in theaters. It's set to debut on Apple TV+ on July 10th instead, but that won't yield the best experience, Hanks said. ""I don't mean to make angry my Apple overlords, but there is a difference in picture and sound quality,""
Of course Tom Hanks is excellent in the role and the film totally revolves around his character and the decisions he is called to make.
The book that the movie is based on ""The Good Shepherd ""by CS Forrester has been adapted by Tom Hanks who wrote the screenplay, perhaps a mistake.
The action takes place early in in World War II 1942 . Hanks is cast as Captain Krause an inexperienced U.S. Navy captain who must lead an Allied convoy in the North Atlantic that is being relentlessly stalked and attacked by Nazi U-boat wolfpacks.
I hope there was more character development in the book than in Tom Hanks screenplay but it's action and warfare the entire movie apart from a romantic flashback in the beginning.
I got the impression Captain Krause was a card carrying Christian who was having a spiritual conflict over the human carnage his and the enemies actions were responsible for but that's about it.
He prays a lot as Im sure many did in that horrible battle.
After watching Greyhound I wouldn't be bothered seeing it at the Cinema if it was released. I just didn't find it interesting, thought provoking or entertaining.
In fact I did find the sound quality lacking especially trying to hear the muffled dialogue over the film score by Blake Neely and cacophony of ammunition discharge.
If you like plenty of battle action with no character development which 1917 had in spades Greyhounds your film. It's fast moving a relatively short 90minutes long
but I've forgotten it already.",Greyhound
58,anselmdaniel,Action centric,7,8 November 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Greyhound is an American war movie that premiered in 2020 on Apple TV. The movie is directed by Aaron Schneider, and is based on the novel 'The Good Shepard' by C. S. Forester. The movie is about an Allied convoy that traverses the Atlantic and finds itself stalked by a German wolfpack of submarines.Greyhound takes place in the second World War and is from the perspective of a naval convoy commander. The convoy is attacked and stalked by German U-boats throughout the movie. The scenes that feature the Allied destroyers fighting the German submarines are incredibly impressive to watch. The computer generated imagery (C. G. I.) is incredibly authentic and resembles a real naval engagement. These scenes where the destroyers and submarines engage are riveting from the start to the finish. The audience can feel the naval guns deep and thunderous sounds hurling fire into the seas. Watching Greyhound for only the action scenes is worth the price of admission.The quieter scenes are used to develop the characters. Not many of the characters are given much development besides Commander Ernest Krause, played by Tom Hanks. This is one of the more disappointing parts of the movie as the audience does not get a deeper movie. Character depth could have added more wrinkles to the story but as it stands it is barebones. The captain has a few flashback scenes and that is about the extent of the depth.There was a questionable inclusion of the Allied destroyers picking up German transmissions. These transmissions were done by the Germans to harass and mentally attack the Allied naval officers. However, these transmissions did not make much sense. The German submarine commanders were giving away that they were still stalking the Allied convoy. The movie could have done better removing these scenes and had the enemy be more voiceless. The audience knows how villainous the Germans are and they do not need to know more besides what they see from their actions.I would recommend ""Greyhound"".Grade: C.",Greyhound
59,msbreviews,Greyhound could have been a small-scale Dunkirk. But...,5,13 July 2020,"I love war movies, especially when they're able to depict the action in such an immersive way that the viewers really feel like they're there. In my opinion, it's the genre that most requires a technically outstanding production quality. The visual effects need to be absolutely perfect. The cinematography must capture the intensity of the battlefield. The sound design has to be incredibly powerful. Finally, a war film requires the most epic, nail-biting, chill-inducing score so the audience can actually feel the unbelievable atmosphere that this genre usually possesses. Greyhound has one of the greatest actors of all-time as its protagonist, but does it check the points mentioned above?Yes and no. Technically, this movie barely has any issues. The VFX look utterly stunning, no doubt about it. Shelly Jackson, the cinematographer, has one of the most challenging tasks a filmmaker can have: filming in a water environment. He deals with this problem surprisingly well, by allowing the viewers to fully understand everything that's going on for the entire runtime. The score (Blake Neely) is emotionally powerful, but I believe it could have elevated a lot more action sequences than it actually does. The editing (Mark Czyzewski, Sidney Wolinsky) is excellent as well.So, what failed? Well, I will always defend that the two pillars of any film are its story and characters. Without one of these two, very few movies can survive. Without the two, no film can. I have to use Dunkirk as an example here. Christopher Nolan spent the whole marketing campaign saying that his movie was about the depiction of an actual war. About how it felt to actually be in one. Therefore, Dunkirk barely has any sort of character development... because not only it never intended to, but it doesn't need it to accomplish its goal.However, its storytelling follows a distinct method that allows for some exhilarating moments in the air, ground, and sea. Its action sequences are so powerful and incredibly realistic that I consider it the most immersive war experience I have ever experienced. Thus, the lack of compelling characters didn't really bother me because I was there to try to feel what it's like to be in a war. Greyhound also doesn't have one single character who's well-developed or well-explored. They all seem to have names, and that's it. Tom Hanks is obviously impressive in his acting role...But his skills as a screenwriter definitely need to improve. Like I insinuate above, there's no problem in having depthless characters, as long as the story and, in this case, the action, work. None do. I'm not lying when I write that 90%+ of the script is Hanks yelling ""turn right"", ""hard left"", ""slow down"", and hundreds of other types of direction guidelines in naval language. The action is lackluster. Basically, the whole film is a repetitive, tiresome cycle of a U-boat showing up on the radar, Hanks looking through several windows shouting the same naval stuff to his crew, and trying to eliminate the enemy's ships.I could feel the suspense and the tension that Hanks' ship emanated. I love the first encounter and pursuit of the first U-boat, it's exceptionally filmed and quite riveting. But from this moment on, it's just the same sequence stuck on repeat mode until no more ships exist. So, even though the set pieces look marvelous, these scenes quickly lose impact. Aaron Schneider should have found a way of elevating Hanks' screenplay, but unfortunately, he can only do so much. By the end, I'm left with a character whose name I can barely remember (honestly, I needed two full minutes to remember the protagonist's name after the movie ended).All in all, Greyhound could have easily ended up as a small-scale Dunkirk. Technically, it has everything it needs to be a brilliant war flick: beautiful visual effects, powerful sound design, impeccable cinematography, and an epic score. Disregarding one of the two pillars of filmmaking (story and characters) is only an issue if the other also doesn't work. The lack of any character development can be perfectly compensated in a war film, as long as the method of storytelling allows for a unique experience packed with realistic and immersive action. However, Aaron Schneider's movie doesn't possess a compelling story, and the action set pieces are stuck in a dull cycle of hunting U-boats in the exact same way throughout the whole film. The first sequence is packed with tension and suspense, but from that moment on, the entertainment levels drop drastically. Tom Hanks is fantastic as the protagonist, but his screenplay is far from truly being one. All dialogues revolve around characters (mostly Hanks's) calling naval instructions for most of the runtime and looking either through a window or binoculars. In the end, it's underwhelming and disappointing, but I still recommend it to the war genre's aficionados.Rating: C",Greyhound

61,SoumikBanerjee25,Needed Strong Characterization!,6,21 October 2020,"""Greyhound"" compels all the necessary efforts to be as authentic as possible, meanwhile adversely ignoring character depths which in return puts us off a safe distance from getting emotionally involved with the unfolding events.
A valiant showcasing of 'The Battle of Atlantic', with a stunning array of camera work & CGI; the film displays visual prominence.
High octane Soundscore complimenting the fascinating imagery competently.
All the hardships & labor done by the Soldiers at that time, carefully portrayed.
As per the presentation goes; It excells in that regard.The matter of contention lies somewhere else...The characters lack depth, Tom Hanks as the lead without any question is rock solid; but his character faced a similar fate.
Screenplay is repetitive in nature, although the tension successfully creeps in time to time; no risks were taken. The writers decided to select a safe passage.
The same sequential pattern of dodging, attacking, maneuvering etc.
Relentlessly continual.So to conclude, This is targeted towards a very specific & niche group of audience who are ardent fans of War movies.

62,0w0,"Good and action packed, but no plot and too short...",7,11 July 2020,"The movie is only 1hr20mins long... and that's simply not long enough to tell a good story... look at the best war films ever made like Saving Private Ryan (1998) at 2hrs50mins, or The Pianist (2002) at 2hrs30mins, or Downfall (2004) at 2hrs35mins, or Fury (2014) at 2hrs15mins... this movie is basically 100% action packed from start to finish and leaves no space for plot or character development at all, unlike the great war films that I've mentioned above.Tom Hanks delivers a very good performance and the CGI in the film is extremely good (not the best it could be, but still extremely good). I also would have loved to perhaps see the movie from the perspective of the other ships and maybe even the Germans, just in an attempt to make the film less one-sided.Overall, it's a good 7/10 war film and worth the watch if you've never watched the great films I've mentioned above already. It's not a film that I'd re-watch at all unfortunately, as it's just not 'good enough' and not 'deep enough' for you to have missed anything in your first watching.

63,MrDHWong,"A taut, suspenseful journey into the mindset of one man and his crew",8,16 July 2020,"Greyhound is a war thriller film written by and starring Tom Hanks. Based on the novel ""The Good Shepherd"" by C. S. Forester, it is a taut, suspenseful journey into the mindset of one man and his crew as they make a perilous attempt to undertake an important but deadly task.Near the beginning of World War II, the Allied powers organise a special route for convoy ships travelling across the Atlantic Ocean to deliver supplies to each other with protection by American, Canadian, and British naval vessels. To try and stop these deliveries from reaching their destination, the Germans send their fleet of U-boats to torpedo any Allied ships within the large gap of the Atlantic known as the ""Black Pit"" before they are able reach the security of air support near the shore. In charge of the latest convoy is the newly appointed Captain Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks), whose relative inexperience comes as a surprise to his crew as he commands the USS Keeling (codenamed ""Greyhound"") through treacherous waters swarming with enemy submarines.Films about decisive naval battles have always made for great cinema, with the likes of ""The Guns Of Navarone"", ""Das Boot"", and even the recent ""Dunkirk"" springing to mind whenever the term is mentioned. This is due to the claustrophobic nature of the setting, usually on a warship and/or a submarine, which allows for tense interactions among the cast of characters as well as the slightest lapse in judgement being the cause for major casualties. ""Greyhound"" follows suit in this regard by successfully implementing most of these tropes without ever feeling cliched or silly. Instead, we have an effective wartime thriller that makes solid use of its short running time of only 91 minutes. Apart from the first five or so minutes of exposition at the start of the film, we are frequently treated to some nail-biting suspense regarding whether or not the convoy will survive this dangerous expedition with its crew still surviving. Each scene of evasive action may be followed up with another involving a barrage of depth charges and torpedoes being launched, bringing a nice balance of close calls and explosive action that keeps the audience on its toes.Director Aaron Schneider moves things along at a nice, brisk pace by showing both the Captain and the crew of the Greyhound as they deal with an almost invisible threat to their safety. It is established that the radar and sonar equipment used in that era was still in its infancy and prone to bouts of unreliability. This of course meant that the Captain sometimes had to rely solely on his own wit and strategic knowledge to overcome any obstacles that the enemy U-boats were throwing their way. Unfortunately, this is where the film got somewhat carried away with the overuse of naval jargon. I understand that this may have been done to present a more realistic sense of what is happening but it became overwhelming at times to try and absorb every bit of slang-based information that was being quoted at us. Although not all of the dialogue was entirely important to following the story, it still would have been nice if some of it had been simplified for casual audiences unfamiliar with naval vocabulary. The film's cinematography showcases the cramped conditions of these ships, with the Captain and crew constantly needing to push past each other during a scene of conflict. Surprisingly, there's not a single moment where shaky-cam is used, which is something I have grown to hate seeing in films nowadays as I now associate it with being a cheap method of showing tension. Rather, things are as level-headed as the Greyhound's Captain himself.Tom Hanks, who also adapted the film's screenplay from the novel it was based on, is once again playing his usual likeable self in a position of importance. A role like this certainly doesn't break new ground for the acting veteran but instead proves that if it ain't broke, why bother fixing it? Hanks is no stranger to writing screenplays, having intermittently penned some films since 1996's ""That Thing You Do!"" and it is clear that he has written this film around himself as the lead character. I think this worked well for the most part, as we can appreciate Captain Krause's hard work ethic when it is being presented to us via a likeable actor such as Hanks. However, this also meant that the film was a one-man show, as it did not allow for any of the supporting cast to give memorable performances outside of simply following orders. It's a shame there couldn't have been more done about any of these characters as there was definitely potential there. I particularly wanted to learn more about the radar technician struggling to get his machine to work during the most crucial of times, but he barely has any screen time and ended up fading into the background as the action became more intense.While it may not be considered a classic in years to come, ""Greyhound"" already feels like essential viewing alongside other naval battle films of this caliber, thanks to how interesting and realistic the overall story comes across. Despite being based on a work of fiction, the event of The Battle of the Atlantic that it is inspired from was very real and a situation such as this one could have very easily happened. Will we see another war film like this from Tom Hanks in the near future? One can only hope.I rate it 8/10",Greyhound
64,Alexander_Blanchett,Solid marine war film,7,19 July 2020,"It was a decent battleship movie. I had some issues with the lack of character development and story development. It often felt like a very well photographed documentation. The primary part of the dialogues were commands and directions shouted by Tom Hanks' character.
I honestly respect this as a passion project of the 2 time Academy Award winning actor as he also wrote the screenplay for it.
The most outstanding aspects of the film were the visuals. Especially the cinematography was breathtaking and the editing fantastic. Those combat scenes were truly a pleasure for the eyes.
It also realistically depict the lives on a battleship. The performance of Tom Hanks was also fine, though nothing outstanding for an actor of his calibre. The other actors, for example Elisabeth Shue were rather wasted in small and almost non existing roles or characters.
The direction was better than the screenplay however I wished they would have given the story and characters more edge and depth.

65,TheTruthofItIs,Decent WWII destroyer vs subs battler,6,1 August 2020,"It's a good thing this went straight to PPV/VOD because it'd have failed big time at the BO. Why, with all these great reviews?! Because it's a WWII ship/sub battle based in the north Atlantic. The demographic for that is like 0.01% of the US population. Ok, it stars Tom Hanks, so let's boost that 10X to 0.1% of the US pop. Note, he's the only A-lister, all others are unknowns. Since it's a destroyer (""USS Greyhound"") vs sub(s) dramatization you do get insight into military strategy and tactics, at least circa 1945, but that insight doesn't really translate into today's hyper-tech military, so, it's kind of disposable knowledge. Another storytelling shortcoming is that it's told/shown exclusively from the bridge of the destroyer, you don't see anything from the perspective of other ships in the convoy nor of the German subs, so that's a cost-cutting cheat that really hurts a film that could've been great; instead, it's so-so, passable, a C+ if you're grading like that.",Greyhound

67,trinaboice,"Really good, but...",8,13 July 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
When I first heard the title of this new Tom Hanks movie, I thought it was going to be about the bus company: Greyhound or maybe even about the famous dog breed. I hadn't seen a trailer and I had never heard of this true story from WWII where an allied convoy gets stalked by German submarines Wolfpack for days. We're told in the movie that during the Battle of the Atlantic, over 3,500 ships carrying millions of tons of cargo were sunk; 72,200 souls were lost forever.But it had me at Tom Hanks. Who doesn't absolutely adore Tom Hanks? He wrote the screenplay for this movie, as well as stars in it. The screenplay was based on the novel The Good Shepherd by C. S. Forester. He also wrote the screenplay for Larry Crowne, which was just okay, but I really loved his screenplay for the movie That Thing You Do!. He even directed those two movies, but it's Aaron Schneider who directs this film.
Have you heard of the Tom Hanks moment of the pandemic? It's what some people are calling the moment that most Americans actually realized that the Coronavirus was dangerous.
TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Most kids will be bored, although it's nice that there is a WWII movie rated PG-13, rather than R so that teens could watch it if they wanted to learn a little bit about history.
People die but you don't see any bodies up close, other than the American flag draped over them.
Destruction of ships.THINGS I LIKED:
At the beginning of the movie, you hear real sound bites from World War II, which immediately sets the tone and establishes the urgency.
I love that Tom Hanks' character prayed, quoted scripture, and was a man of faith. I can't imagine going through WWII without faith. Tom Hanks is a master performer at displaying the Everyday Man meeting extraordinary challenges with heroism and humility. It's the sixth time Tom Hanks has played a Captain!
There's a lot of action. Almost non-stop, in fact. You feel the tension in almost every scene.
The bird's-eye views were fascinating with good cinematography by Shelly Johnson.
The funeral scene was sobering and effective.
That Nazi German U-boat voice was super creepy.
You get to see actual film footage and pictures from the war on the sea at the end of the movie.
Beautiful sweeping music by Blake Neely.
Some of the shots were filmed aboard Her Majesty's Canadian Ship Montreal and the U.S. S. Kidd in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
The movie is extremely efficient, clocking in at only an hour and a half to represent events that took place over 48 intense hours in real life.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
People might get bored listening to all of the technical, nautical jargon, not knowing exactly what's happening.
Unfortunately, we don't get to really know the characters well, so when their life is in peril, it's hard to care a lot about them, other than they are fellow-Americans. There was potential to dive deeper into the characters and their relationships, but the opportunities were missed.
It's a bit repetitive. Because there is tension in almost every scene, you almost become numb to it.
Lots of scenes where people are frantically looking through binoculars.
Some of the scenes take place at night, which will make it hard to see what's happening if/when you watch this on small devices.
We never learn what's going on with the Captain's bleeding feet. It simply illustrates that he continues working hard despite his personal challenges.
Sadly, it's forgettable.
There's no humor. This film is 100% serious drama.",Greyhound

Ship bourne radar and sonar really became widely available in 1943 not 42 when the Uboats were at their peak, I could go on but there are many many flaws.

But because we're not jumping all around to different locations with different people, it's much easier for Tom Hanks to develop the character of Captain Krause. We learn what makes him tick, what frightens him and how he draws on the strength of his crew to navigate the threats lurking below the icy waters.But it's not just the ""Hanks Show"" here - ''Greyhound' is filmed beautifully. CGI isn't gratuitous, nor is it wasted. The soundtrack elevates the action that unfolds like the waves that crash against the ships' hulls. And the general suspense that carries throughout the entire film is something that you don't always find in a World War II-set film.If 'Greyhound' is representative of what we can expect from other Apple TV+ original films, we have a lot to look forward to.",Greyhound
78,SnobReviews,An action-packed war film.,7,13 July 2020,"""Greyhound"" is a fast-paced and high-octane film that will satisfy those in need of a good action war epic.
.
In this war drama set during World War II, an inexperienced U.S. Navy captain must lead an Allied convoy being stalked by Nazis.
.
From the opening scene, ""Greyhound"" is a nail-bitter packed with intensity and a solid performance from Tom Hanks. Hanks also did a great job at writing the screenplay based on the 1955 novel. For some reason, the CGI battle scenes didn't bother me as much as I thought they would. For 90-minutes, the film is a non-stop battle extravaganza that is sure to entertain all viewers.",Greyhound
79,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,10,19 June 2021,"Good Morrow.A ten is probably a bit generous, but it's much better than the poor reviews by the anti-military faction of our woke culture, who don't appreciate sacrifice or honor or duty.As a guy who stood bridge watch many times, this was absolutely riveting and accurate. The history of U-Boats harassing the merchant fleet is woefully unrepresented in the canon of WW2 films. Tom Hanks does his typical good job and while I'm not a massive fan of his, I commend him for getting involved in this project (that he helped to create). He is very good at playing a fatigued leader who must see the mission through.It shouldn't go without saying, that anymore, it takes guts for big Hollywood talent to tackle a topic that highlights patriotism and devotion to the country. The trend now is woke stuff...this movie has none of that.Honestly, I wished the movie was longer.I'm deducting one star for the CGI, which should have been better...outside that, this movie is a solid 10 for me.High Recommend!Cheers.",Greyhound
80,DeBBss,Tom Hanks On Another Boat...,6,13 July 2020,"Greyhound is a simple movie that focuses on an aspect that is barely even mentioned in WW2 films. I love the simplicity so much, it's just a captain fighting and surviving against German U-boats. What's great is that Greyhound is only 1.5 hours long, and no scene feels too long or unnecessary.There's constant action that's thrilling and entertaining. The realism is great and the screenplay (written by Tom Hanks) proves that there was a lot of research put into it. The acting was solid all around; Tom Hanks giving a grounded performance.Greyhound is short and simple; it knows what it is and what it has to do. The action to the acting was fun and realistic. Greyhound is a movie that if you have the chance, you should watch it.",Greyhound

Director: Aaron Schneider
Starring: Tom Hanks, Elisabeth Shue, Stephan Graham, Matt helm, Rob Morgan etcOverall rating 54/100Greyhound takes place at the beginning of WW2, a US navy captain on his first time, must help his entire crew escape Nazi navy boats before it's to late to save everyone. Greyhound despite having some great components, sadly for me was a disappointment, let's talk about why this was.First of all, the main performance from Tom hanks, tense tone and use of sound was great. Despite some odd creative choices and bad dialogue for the character which we will get onto soon, the main performance from Tom Hanks was great. He is such an experienced actor that he is great in whatever role he is given, and greyhound was no different, he just had an instantly respected and powerful presence on screen, and you believed in his leadership skills, which was a blend of the character work and the performance. The film also had a very tense throughout which was great, due to the Nazi boats often being hidden, you never knew when an attack from them would happen, so this therefore kept me on edge throughout and made me actively sympathise with the characters for being in that kind of situation. What also helped with the tone and just in general was the use of sound, they cleverly added the quick sounds of dials being moved, or clocks ticking when the scenes were at there most tense to make it even more gripping to watch which was great.However, my first couple of negatives linked to my previous point, would be the odd creative choices for the main character, and the poor script. To have Tom hanks character a Christian and constantly praying for others lives and getting upset when killing the enemy was an odd creative choice for me that just didn't work, with it being the war, and his character being the captain of the ship, he should have been acting like the other crew members when their was victory, having him pray and be upset just made him look out of place. I do also have to say that the script to the film was extremely poor. I think Tom Hanks should just stick to acting and not to screenwriting as the script here was paper thin. It lacked any form of depth or creativity, the characters were simple and had one simple role with nothing else added to them, and the dialogue was very back and forth and felt almost robotic with the it's simplicity, it wasn't good at all.My next few positives would be the powerful beginning, cinematography and slight attempts at character background. I thought the use of voiceover going into details of the second world war at the beginning was a very powerful way to start the movie, it got you interested straight away, and was educational in terms of informing the audience the challenges the Americans faced during the war, also the cinematography was fantastic, the simple yet effective colour palette of the sea and ships were great, the cinematography just looked incredibly realistic for a fairly small budget which made the film a better experience and showed the visual skills of the creative team behind the movie. I also appreciated the attempt at character background for Tom Hanks character despite a small amount. The fact that his character was in love with a women who said that they couldn't be together, gave him the motivation to be a good captain, and throughout the film you felt her presence in his actions.My final few positives would be the action sequences, clever villains and satisfying ending. The action sequences between the boats were fantastic, they were consistently entertaining and had you on edge, and I never knew who was going to come out of it victorious so the film did a good job at making it predictable or obvious of who was going to win. The villains were also really clever, the fact that you never knew whether the Nazis or the Americans would win because of how clever the Nazis were, whether it was disappearing of the ships radar, wasting ships ammo or destroying food supplies it was not an easy battle for the protagonists. Due to the uncertainty of who would be victorious this made the ending that little but more satisfying. When the whole ship was finally victorious, you couldn't help but sympathise with the emotions of the men on board after everything they had been through with each other.However now time for my final few negatives, there wasn't any character development, there was offensive and old-fashioned race roles, and a lack of connection to the relationships and characters within the film. I thought that the roles within the film for people of colour were not good. There was one actor of colour and all he did was get food for all the white people on board, it just felt very out of place with modern society, and very old fashioned and backward thinking, especially with the movements that are going on at the minute this felt slightly insensitive. Next there was no character development whatsoever. All the characters were so simple and had one role throughout the movie, nothing changed about their character or personality making the film difficult to connect with. Because of this, I had no connection to any of the characters or relationships throughout. None of the friendships felt authentic or believable, and even the relationship between Tom Hanks and the women he loved felt unrealistic and awkward this was due to the lack of development and poor script.Overall despite a great main performance from Tom Hanks and excellent visual work, Greyhound is a massive let down, due to it's poor script and character work that made the film difficult to connect with or enjoy fully.",Greyhound

84,thebricks,"Not great, very boring",5,11 July 2020,"Kind of a boring story to tell. Not worthy of a movie. It's basically reverse Das Boot. Whereas the U-Boat crew in Das Boot were underdogs in serious peril, the Greyhound crew is basically on a comfy theme park ride. The captain and crew got delicious meals in the middle of battle. Any Uboats trying to attack were dealt with with by serious, organized firepower. I couldn't tell one ship apart from another, there was no reason to care. Of course, the Greyhound had serious plot armor and you knew no torpedo would scratch the ship. The movie eventually just ends and that's that.Can't recommend.",Greyhound

86,flingebunt,"Great Nautical Drama, but with a focus on the technical over the human",6,14 July 2020,"The first rule of doing anything, is if the captain is Tom Hanks, don't go. Yes Tom Hanks is once again a captain and things will go wrong. This time, it is the height of the WW2 Battle of the Atlantic and he is in charge of a convoy being hunted by a wolf pack of U=boats.It is a great tense drama that focuses on the process of the fighting with good direction and acting that shows glimpses of the humans involved in this. The action is mostly shown from the point of view of people on the destroyer. Though it annoying cuts to perspectives of the U-boats which takes you out of the immersion.What the movie doesn't do is let you into the lives of the people on the destroyer. It cuts from action sequence to action sequence, which of course means you don't see the tension and fear found in the waiting or the relationships between crew members.The result is a good, but not great movie that is worth watching (as it is streamed online).

Taking a cue from _Dunkirk_, the background score has been sculpted to heighten tension and is a constant companion to the crests and troughs of your heart beats. This has many scenes that can be used in MBA classes to teach virtues of being a calm leader in the fog of war.Tom Hanks, who has also written the screenplay, doesn't get too many chances to show off his acting chops.

90,doorsscorpywag,Unbelievable,1,10 July 2020,"The biggest problem with this film was Tom Hanks.
He is a good actor but over rated and his performance here was terrible.
Mind you the screenplay (he wrote)was pretty thin and he did not have that much to do anyway.He kept asking for things from his cabin and I expected him to eventually be sitting in a bath chair smoking a pipe reading Kipling. Which would have been good for the crew as he was an idiot.Mind you not as stupid as the Germans whose tactics seemed to be surface next to the Greyhound in broad daylight and shoot it out.
At the end a British Captain after receiving Hanks report said 'unbelievable' and it was.The British Movie The Cruel Sea (1953) had a believable portrayal of the Atlantic War and the effect it had on those who kept watch and fought and died there. It was superbly acted and totally believable. Greyhound was a joke of a film. Not as bad as the laughable U571 but a joke all the same.Perhaps with a none star name and less money spent on explosions and more on an actual script and it might have been half decent.",Greyhound
91,Screen_O_Genic,Iron Coffins,9,23 July 2020,"The Battle of the Atlantic was perhaps the crucial conflict of the Second World War. With Britain and the Soviet Union needing essential supplies to maintain the war effort the Western Allies supported and protected the ships delivering material with armed convoys to the beleaguered countries. Nazi Germany sought to stop this using their famed U-Boat submarines and when the two sides clashed arguably the greatest naval battle in history took place. Based on the novel ""The Good Shepherd"" by C.S. Forester ""Greyhound"" is an action-packed thriller that brings the chaos and carnage of war to the big screen. Tom Hanks plays Ernest Krause, the commander of naval escorts assigned to protect ships carrying supplies to Britain. Inexperienced with the task at hand, Krause's religiosity and martial skill is put to the severest test. The film admirably highlights the strain and pressure both commander and crew undergo in the turmoil and bloodbath of battle. With well-done CGI the movie showcases the Battle of the Atlantic in all its raging nautical glory: artillery blasts, depth charges, torpedo fires and ships trying to evade them, air support, direct hits and the accompanying explosions, the howls and screams of men in agony and confusion and many more. While the nonstop scurrying to and fro within a narrow confined space make the film a bit redundant the endless action and suspense will leave one wanting more and wondering what to expect next. One essential credit to the film especially in these times is the lack of an agenda using the movie to push a noxious issue. The film sticks to how a war film should be and is all the better for it. With another impressive performance by Tom Hanks and a strong supportive cast ""Greyhound"" elevates itself to one of the best war films made and is a sterling tribute to the brave men who fought for the freedom we take for granted today.",Greyhound

97,skpn123,A Masterful film led by Tom Hanks creating realism and heart on a low budget,10,15 July 2020,"This film was an educational experience for my teenagers about the long and complex battle of the Atlantic. They asked constant and important questions throughout the film and we were able to give them context on the depictions of Naval Warfare in WW2. Based on a 1955 novel, the film follows a Navy captain who must shepherd men and ships safely across the perilous Atlantic Ocean to join the war. It was set soon after Pearl Harbour. It's relatively short length of 1.5 hours is well-suited to the short attention span of the young generation. I have not seen my kid's interest so effectively sparked before and we do movie night once a week and a lot of war movies.U.S. Navy Cmdr. Ernest Krause's first wartime assignment is to lead an Allied convoy across the most dangerous part of the Atlantic, the stretch known as ""the Black Pit."" He commands the destroyer USS Keeling - call sign Greyhound - whose role was to protect 37 Allied ships even as a group or ""wolfpack"" of German U-boats closed in on them.We loved the authenticity of the dialogue and general faithfulness to the technical and communication side of naval warfare including terminology. This could have been the most boring film ever but instead it was vibrant, tense and involved subtle but very effective character development. The audience were reminded by the Captain of the value of each and every soul lost, either allied or enemy.The level of detail in communications needed for Greyhound to be effective was very impressive down to the sharing of the Sonar/Radar reports. It offers a memorable snapshot the taxing and repetitive (not to mention, cold, miserable and wet) the battle truly was. My grandfather worked as a chef in WW2 and it was nice to see the importance of kitchen staff to the wellbeing of the crew highlighted.",Greyhound
98,Michael Fargo,"Not necessarily my kind of film, but....",10,10 July 2020,"This film harkens back to the 1940's-1950's WWII films like ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo,"" ""They Were Expendable,"" ""The Fighting Seabees,"" etc. That were very heavy on action with little fuss made over an attached drama. The action was what was central, and ""Greyhound"" all by disposes of any need to fluff things up with families waiting at home. ""Das Boot"" is probably the best comparison to the model ""Greyhound"" chooses.Having grown up during the 40's and 50's, WWII films were something I couldn't relate to, but as I've matured and realized the incredible sacrifice these men and women made, I really value an effort to honor them. And Hanks has unquestionably played a large role in honoring those men and women who gave so much. His screenplay is driven by heart and the talent and detail and sacrifice included here is respectful and worthy.It's a short film, showing the peril of crossing the Atlantic and running the gauntlet of the German U-boat's that were so simple and elegant in their effective deterrent of the Allied threat. The film doesn't take much time in orienting the viewer to procedure and the eminent danger the large convoy faces. The use of narrative titles is helpful, but finally unnecessary. We're witnesses to what happens, and as the film progresses we quickly get our bearings as to what the danger is and how the men on board the Greyhound perform their role in protecting a large merchant convoy suppling allied troops in Europe.The toll this takes and the responsibility heaped upon the central character played by Hanks needs no real explanation. Any human life--due to his faith--is precious to him, and as the film moves forward he realizes his roll is to protect one side at all costs to the other. It's an important detail. My father, a Marine in the South Pacific theater, couldn't talk about the losses he inflicted on the enemy. While he bore resentment, he took no joy in taking any life. But this is a small detail in ""Greyhound."" It's focus is the action and skill it took to avoid being hit, and one excruciating moment when the Greyhound is put as a target of two triangulated torpedoes, shows the inevitability of warfare and the near impossibility of maneuvering the floating tonnage of a war ship on the rough open waters of the Atlantic. Whether or not they are successful, you'll have to see the film. It's spectacular.",Greyhound

100,Lewis_Heather787,I was left wanting more !,7,11 July 2020,"Tom Hanks in a submarine film set in World War 2, what more could you want ? Well as it turns out ""more"" because what we were given was only a glimpse into a film that could have been great. Don't get me wrong, I really really enjoyed this film, however my overriding feeling after seeing it was the missed opportunity that this film really was. It had all the ingredients to be a great film unfortunately it didn't utilise them or use them at all, therefore this film will only ever be good......saying that when has Tom Hanks not been in something at least good.Talking of Mr. Hanks, he is of course the main attraction of the film, after all its one of the main reasons I even bothered to watch this film. Needless to say that he delivers a great performance as usual, he is as good as you think he is going to be. At this stage he is just making it look ridiculously easy. The rest of the cast are great, mainly unknown faces to me which helps in the immersion of the film........apart from Stephen Graham who is a very recognisable face.As I've said everything is good in this film, however it could have been much much better. Firstly this film is way way to short in terms of runtime, which leads into my first criticism of the film......character development. There is pretty much no character development throughout the film and no relationship building. There could have been 30 minutes added on at the start building the ground work for the story, introducing everyone and fleshing out the characters. It could have made for a more rich and interesting viewing, in my opinion. The second way of making this film a little better was to maybe expand outside of just the ""Greyhound"" ship and maybe now and then see the crew of the other British ships. Would have made the audience care more about all the individuals and increased the tension. Although saying all this its wasn't a terrible idea not to show them at all, however I would get rid of the stereotypical portrayal of the German Sub taunting the ship. The last thing I would add would be more of an climax/ending, this film ends very quickly. The final battle could have gone on for a bit longer and we could have seen all three of the surviving ships make it to their destination. Maybe I'm knit picking now?Overall even though I have some complaints more to do with how to improve the film not saying how terrible it is. Its one of the most solid films you can watch this year. Did it suffer without the theatrical release in a cinema, maybe....maybe not. I don't think it would add that much more. 70% out of 100 its a good solid film that I would recommend, not the best submarine film there are much better ones out there. Still a very enjoyable watch!",Greyhound

And boy, does Hollywood's mainstay Tom Hanks deliver in Greyhound, within the confines of a home-viewing experience.A movie that genuinely deserved a run on the big screens, Greyhound paints its story on a mammoth canvas, giving us an in-depth POV experience of how a WW2 destroyer flagship was commanded.A chilling tale of a cat-and-mouse game between a group of US Navy destroyers and German U-Boats, this one is for every war-movie aficionado.Hanks is at his brilliant best as per usual and is ably complemented by stunning choreographed naval battle sequences with some spine-tingling sound design that will leave you awestruck.

This is actually what true heroism looks like, as also the many parents who are trying to bring up their children to be good, decent and honest citizens striving to build a better society, in spite of the countless lures and distractions seeking to pull them in other directions. Real heroes don't wear capes or have super powers - they look just like the rest of us, but manage to find something extra inside them in times of need.
The efforts of the Atlantic convoys meant that - at a very heavy cost in lives and materiel - supplies got through to the British and Russians resisting the nazi regime, enabling them to turn the tide and defeat fascism. That it was replaced by a different form of totalitarianism isn't to humanity's credit and means we still have to remain alert till this day.

110,Slarkshark,Intense Naval Warfare,8,11 November 2021,"Almost the entire film consists of one long drawn out battle in the open ocean, aside from a little back ground scene with Tom Hanks and his girlfriend. This helps shows how intense and stressful those long hours would have been for those sailors.The movie felt very real from the language to the tactics. Tom Hanks did well at humanizing the film as the experienced naval man, yet rookie to combat. He was cool under pressure which gave him the respect of his crew and confidence of the other Allied ships. Speaking of which, I truly enjoyed seeing the CGI rendering of the HMCS Sackville portrayed by HMCS Dodge, call sign ""Dicky"". The U-boats were haunting, especially with the eerie sound clips every time one appeared on screen. 'The Enemy Below' is most likely the most similar, but also a superior film in my opinion.'Greyhound' served as one of my Remembrance/Veterans Day movies for this year, and I am very grateful for those who risked everything to cross those dangerous seas to supply the front and fight in WWII.

111,achyutaghosh,tense WW2 thriller,8,12 July 2020,"War is battle of economic might of countries. With that in mind, and without a functional navy among other things, Germany was always going to lose World War 2. Supplies from America kept Britain alive in the war. But there was a phase when the German navy terrorized Allied supplies through it's U-boats. Operating in packs, and attacking convoys at night in areas that were beyond the reach of air protection, German U-boats sank more than 6000 ships during WW2. When the U-boat strategy worked for a couple of years, Germany punched above their weight.It is 1942, and Greyhound is the story of one such convoy to Liverpool- 37 ships, escorted by 5 destroyers. Ernest Krause, played by a typically composed Tom Hanks, is in command of the lead destroyer USS Keeling. But even without trying, Hanks exhibits more charisma than what is required. He has after-all played Captain Miller, Jim Lovell, Robert Langdon, James Donovan, and Sully.The German submarines, led by one with the insignia Gray Wolf, begin their attacks 3 days when the convoys are 3 days away from air cover. The rest of the story is about surviving those 72 hours. Clocking in under 90 minutes, it is a taut, action packed thriller that eschews character building for an immersive, fast paced cat and mouse game of ships vs submarines. And immersive it is- watching the ships make evasive maneuvers, torpedoes careening all round, guns blazing, depth-charges exploding, friendly-fire at it's absolute worst, and a beautiful shot of the Aurora Borealis above the clouds during a night-time battle.Greyhound is based upon C.S. Forester's 1955 novel- The Good Shepherd. Given the source material, the enemy is suitably faceless. Always unseen, always hunting, they are ferocious and smart. And while they are at it, they taunt well too.""Gray Wolf is so very hungry. Your women will learn of your dying, and weep into the long night, before they turn to the arms of their lovers""In Greyhound, Tom Hanks also earns his first solo screenplay credit in a 40 year career. It is interesting to see how actors write themselves parts, and being the lead in this one, Hanks does not spare himself the economical treatment. We hardly get to know him beyond perfunctory details like he is religious, he is green, and has a girl waiting for him back home. The other characters fare worse.

113,gcsman,"A taut, extremely well done WWII film, and Tom Hanks is masterful as always",8,7 September 2020,"Too bad we couldn't see this on the big screen. So many of the 'big' scenes of the battles on the open sea of the North Atlantic would have benefited from it. But it's a winner. It's a lean, mean, immersive story of utter simplicity about three crucial days in the life of the destroyer 'Greyhound', which is leading the naval escort of a convoy of supply ships heading to England. Tom Hanks is its captain, and in charge of fending off the lurking German U-boats bent on sinking as many of the precious convoy ships as possible.It's a lean, mean, taut thriller with not a wasted minute. The buildup of tension is immediate and sustained throughout the classic hour-and-a-half runtime. Technically, it's as good as any WWII drama I've seen, with an expert mix of big-scale panorama scenes and highly personal ones on Greyhound's small command bridge. The key to these few days is that the convoy, in the mid-Atlantic, is beyond the zones of air cover from either the American or British sides and is at its most vulnerable. Everything fits. The color palette of almost every scene is shades of grey, of course. It's all well grounded in realism - everyone is simply human and no miracles are about to happen. The Captain (Hanks) knows the hunters are coming after them, and either they will make it through (with losses) or they won't.The movie has some really interesting technical features to offer. In the big open-sea shots, captions appear soundlessly on screen to label the different ships and their locations. And when the naval ships drop depth charges to hit the U-boats, the explosions as seen from the surface make strangely spiky forests of plumes that I've never seen that way before.At a personal level the story is all about the Captain, who is constantly put on the spot to make life-and-death decisions, coordinate the counterattacks with the other escort ships, and (if possible) plan ahead. The rest of the cast (the sailors aboard Greyhound; no other crew of the other ships appear except by radio conversation) are young unknowns, and they're all fine. But this is Tom Hanks' movie and he's masterful. We get a few insights into his character through some flashbacks with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Shue), and through little touches of his demeanor on board. Occasionally the cook brings by a meal on a tray for him while he's in the midst of a desperate battle, and he looks at it as if it's something from another world. He carries a small Bible and quietly prays before sleeping. He watches one of his convoy ships being sunk and you can feel he is taking it as a personal injury: this is his flock, and he's their shepherd. (And true to form, he looks almost the same when a U-boat goes down: they are the enemy, but they are men too.) Most of all, what grows on us is his competence: he's very much not superhuman, but he knows his job despite its personal toll and he knows how to respond to what's being thrown at them.In telling its single story, 'Greyhound' effectively stands in for one of the major parts of the entire Second World War. Absolutely worth seeing.",Greyhound

117,MovieBuff11732,One Of The Better Uses Of CGI In A War Film!,8,30 October 2020,"When you think you've seen all of Tom Hanks war films, there is always one more.Greyhound is about a convoy of ships going across a dangerous part in the Atlantic Sea without any air support. The Captain, Krause (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the main ship Greyhound. This outing is the captains first. They then learn that they are being stalked by a German submarine group named the wolf pack.Greyhound was a film that got the boot from the studio. It was originally supposed to come out in theaters then got moved over to Apple TV because of the situation that we are in right now. This film was one to see in the theaters though. It was a loud action film that was almost made for the theaters. Tom Hanks even came out in said he was mad about this film going to Apple TV. I think it was a smart move by Apple TV to get this film on their streaming platform because of the names attached to it. This whole thing with this film was just disappointing. The movie was pretty good though. It was as good as my expectations. The story was as good as it could be for a film like this. This movie was only an hour and a half but it never dragged. Greyhound was filled to the brim with intensity from start to finish. That being said there was almost no character development so that caused you to not care for any of the crew members. The only character that did have a little development was Captain Krause who was played by Tom Hanks. He had a little scene at the start that showed he trusts in god and how he got this little ship that you saw once in the movie. He was the only character I really knew the name of. Throughout the movie that captain was shouting peoples names but you never really felt a bond for any of the other characters in the film. Which sometimes caused scenes that were supposed to feel sad to just feel like time being wasted. There was a cook that had some background to but nothing much. Character development was a big missed opportunity in this film. I think if they started the film on land and explained some of the characters background, you would have felt more tension throughout the film.The acting was something that had to be spot on for this film. They had to look like they have been through years of training and school to get to this point and they did. Tom Hanks especially nailed his role in the film. He really showed how hard it is to command a ship. All of the other crew members also played their parts spectacularly because of how prepared they looked throughout the film. That was something I was worried about and I came out of the film happy about the acting.The CGI was another I was worried about coming into the film. I thought it was going to somewhere around the line of Midway. That films CGI was terrible and was obvious in many scenes of the movie. Greyhound did a much better job than Midway. Many of the scenes where they had someone standing by a green screen looked incredibly realistic. This sometimes had me questioning weather it was real or not. The only thing I didn't like about the CGI was the computer shots. I have never liked those. A computer shot it when they didn't actually film this scene. They end up doing it with a computer. Those shots always look really glossy. They didn't look terribly bad in this film but they still didn't look good. Otherwise the CGI was flawless. Many of the explosions in the water look fantastic. They really did their research on how they should look.Greyhound was a film that had some of the best looking CGI in recent years and marvelous acting from everyone in the movie. Although they were lacking characters you really felt like you could relate to. I would recommend Greyhound to anybody who likes war films because you really don't get a lot of war films about naval battle.",Greyhound

120,hoernkeem,"Greyhound review (2020, Aaron Schneider) Great battle sequence but lacks heart & connective tissue",7,3 April 2021,"Greyhound (2020, Aaron Schneider)
This is a WWII era action drama based on a novel by C. S. Forester and a screenplay written by star Tom Hanks. Hanks stars as the commander of a naval Destroyer, the USS Keeling with call sign ""Greyhound"". They are the lead of a handful of ships designated to escort a convoy across the Atlantic during WWII. When a convoy attempts an Atlantic crossing they have air cover but there is an area that stretches across the middle of the ocean where planes of the time cannot reach dubbed the ""Black Pit"". During that period the only protection the convoy has from the dreaded German u-boats are the escort vessels. Hanks is Ernest Krause and despite being a well respected, experienced commander this is first wartime command. Almost the entire film is contained in the back and forth between the escort vessels, specifically Greyhound, and the u-boats. It is action packed and leaves little time for quiet, contemplative moments. There is a brief opening prior to Krause leaving for his command talking to a woman he loves played by Elizabeth Shue. It is probably meant to add some humanity to the character, but it winds up being more or less nonessential.This movie primarily excels in the visuals and the technical excellence of the script, acting and production. The battle scenes play out very realistically onboard the ship and it is fascinating to watch the wargames as the u-boats make a play and the surface ships counter, all just trying to maintain as many boats as they can above the water until the return of air cover which is constantly reinforced as the finish line of this life or death race. The visual effects and the direction during the battle sequences is really wonderful to watch. It is a shame the film never saw the big screen as some of these sequences would have been breathtaking in a theater. At 90 minutes the plot is kept very tight which keeps the action rolling which is good on one hand and a bit numbing on the other as the film is basically one long battle sequence with not much done to break it up. This leads to the main negative of the film which is a lack of humanity based on not taking the time or effort to humanize anyone besides Hanks' character with one exception. Krause has a mess attendant named Cleveland and he is one of the few we get to know slightly based on interaction with the commander, and thus it is supposed to resonate when he is killed in one of the u-boat attacks, and it does, but this movie plays so impersonally that it doesn't register as hard as it should. Other than that there are little to no personal moments in the film. The convoy comes through the other side and despite some losses those that survive owe much of their survival to Commander Krause.This film is well made and the acting with Hanks in the lead cannot be denied. It is an entertaining watch. It perhaps could have been better with a beefier running time and a bit more emotion brought to the forefront along with the constant battle. This story also gave the film a very abrupt start and finish as they enter the ""Black Pit"" with little preamble and the film ends as soon as they leave it with no latitude given to any other story element. So while good in many aspects the film did feel one dimensional and while that one dimension did excel a few other fully realized aspects could have made the film one of the best of the year.Eric's Grade: B-",Greyhound
121,michael-561-692892,Nice attempt,5,18 July 2020,"Not. Enough. Character. Development.When you don't make people ""feel"" for a character, the audience doesn't care whether they live or die.In this film, we get a brief snippet into Tom Hank's captain character and his love for a woman as he's sent off to command a ship escorting (badly) a convoy of supply ships. We witness him care more about 4 sailors in the water of a sunken oil tanker than his directive of protecting the other ships in the convoy which results in more destroyed vessels. We also witness his character care more about the dead cook then his directive resulting in more vessels attacked while he and his crew attempt a funeral at sea. None of this makes sense. As an officer you have command of a ship and it's crew and you're given directives. If you don't follow orders your second and third in command will note in logs and risk the command pulled.Hollyweird at it again. Only this time I can simply turn the volume down and it becomes background noise for a nap. AppleTV+ original film... Cook and crew should be spending more time and focus on new and innovative products. This era of Apple will be viewed as a burp.",Greyhound
122,horst69,"Wanted this to be great, no such luck",2,13 July 2020,"It's unfortunate just how little meat is on this bone; I was really looking forward to watching the movie, expecting an epic tale of WWII warfare.Instead this film is a succession of repetitive scenes, with a very limited number of real locations - mostly just the bridge of a ship - and heavily relying on modestly competent CGI to create a larger virtual scale .In the end it's a small B movie on a small stage , though ; much like the countless war movies of the 1950s/60s era, which were shot with limited budget and ambition .
Even the soundtrack resembles in most parts the randomly applied orchestral pathos of those times, and not in a good way .The cast has a few familiar faces in it, but no characters worth mentioning, apart from Hanks, of course .
It's very obvious the entire movie was created around and limited to Tom Hanks' appearance - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, unless you also want there to be a movie ...
When Hanks' character does interact with others, some of the scenes are almost comically desperate to create a connection between him and his surroundings . Which always fails .This movie is in stark contrast to WWII masterpieces like Das Boot ( the movie ) , Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, or Midway ( 1976 ) ; it offers no sense of scale, no intimacy , no realism, no tale worth following, no tension, drama or terror .It is not immersing the viewer beyond the limits of the chamber play that it is .Das Boot showed how it is done ; it's very similar in it's setting , it's even more limited in scale and space - but it creates an invinitely larger picture, densitity, complexity, amount of action and interaction and sophistication, painting a picture of the war in general, while being crammed in an even smaller space . No CGI either ...Smaller physically, but an entire universe created versus the Greyhound's superficial , budget conscious video clip approach .",Greyhound
123,pontus-randen,"Very well made and Tom Hanks is good, as always.",7,29 August 2020,"The CGI is splendid and Tom Hanks does another good job. It is quite an exciting movie that, I assume, shows a bit of reality and gives a feeling of how it was. Why the Captains feet are bleading is never explained, though. And what Elisabeth Shue's appearance added to it is beyond me: Maybe they were just forced to add a female name?",Greyhound
124,azanti0029,"A solid film, which suffers a little from lack of character development.",7,11 July 2020,"PREMISE - I can see from the off what Tom Hanks was going for here with this movie. To put the viewer in the seat of the Captain, on his first voyage, in charge of the defence of an Atlantic convoy heading to re-supply Britain in World War 2 in early 1942 and that is exactly what you get. Consequently we follow the first excursion of Captain Krause, knowing little more about him other than the time he spent in trainning, that he has a sweetheart waiting for him at home and that he's a religious man. Together with his XO, (played by the ever efficent STEPHEN GRAHAM) they soon finding themselves up against a German Wolfpack (Six U-Boat submarines) whose soul mission is to destroy as many of the transport ships Krause is escorting as possible. Will he make it to the other side and if so, how much of his convoy will be left with him?PRODUCTION - Any film of this era depicting large naval combat sequences will envitably use a high pro-portion of CGI, in the Greyhound however, I am pleased to say the VFX work is first rate and you quickly soon forget about it as your drawn into the films many extended battle engagement sequences. Such shots give the appropriate strategic depiction of the battle and the ship interiors and exteriors of the Greyhound Destroyer are extremely well visualised with some excellent Production Design from DAVID CRANK and Art Directors TOM FROLING and LAUREN ROSENBLOOM.CAST - TOM HANKS, as always, is first rate as Krause, conveying the weight of the man's many personal responsabilities incredibly effectively with a solid performance. Krause is a man who can't sleep nor eat until he knows his convoy is out of harms way, and Hanks puts in many little touches to demonstrate this. The equally talented STEPHEN GRAHAM is one of the few other crew members who manages to stand out simply because he is given more to do in terms of working out courses of attack against the next Submarine and gets some of his own screen time. British actor TOM BRITTNEY manages to make his mark on the bridge crew, but again, he is still just another man in uniform, we never find out anything about him, nor indeed anyone else on the bridge. Even ELIZABETH SHUE, really doesn't get to do much other than provide us with a tangiable representation of what Krause is fighting for to stay alive, but her character is quickly forgotten and could have easily just been a photograph on a wall in his ward room and this would have provided the same effect. The other actors in the film all do a fine job and obviously rehearsed naval tactics and styles of that era to replicate them extremely well but they really do tend to merge into one. We never even see the engine room, because of course, the Captain doesn't go down there. I spotted the voice of THOMAS KRETSCHUMANN as the German Captain taunting the convoy, again, not something that happened very often in reality. The casting is great, it's just a shame that we never really got to know any other characters.OVERALL - Because the entire film is told from the POV of Hank's character we really don't get much depth to anyone else beyond their rank and name, as each barks orders back and fourth. Taking this route is a risky one, on the positive side it keeps the film at a cracking pace and the entire. singular, narrative journey is a fairly intense experience, with the lions share of the film given to the combat sequences, as the Greyhound and her fellow escort ships stalk the German U-Boats continually in dark brooding seas. These scenes do make for nail biting stuff, but when casualties occur on board, other than the fact that we vaguely knew who one of them was from an earlier scene we never got to know any of these people, so we do not feel the same sense of emotional loss (Nor indeed any) as Krause when he has to bury men at sea. How problematical this is for you will depend largely where your primary interest lies, but I would have liked to see at least one or two below decks scenes where we got to know some of the other men and had something of an insight into their world and fears too. Consequently their losses would have been more keenly felt by the viewer. But the focus here is on telling a real depiction of surface to submarine combat in World War Two and the procedural mechanics of this are played out on screen beautifully (and to my understanding as other veterans have said on here, very accurately.)
These scenes do score very highly and provide more than adequate tension in the movie but the destruction of so many submarines on the surface by a single convoy, does however seem a little unlikely. (The incident depicted in the film where a submarine had surfaced between two destoyers and fired with surface weapons upon them both did in fact take place and was I presume based on that event)
Overall this is a well made solid film, of which Hanks himself wrote the screenplay, and he certainly did apply the first and most important rule of screenwriting, 'less is more' and kept the story as lean as possible. Hence the films very tight 90 minute running time. But if a journey in the Captains chair is what you want to experience, then in The Greyhound, you're certainly going to get it.",Greyhound

Just a little clarification. Personally, I really liked this war film in connection with one of the episodes of the famous Battle of the Atlantic which was: the longest battle in history, starting on September 3, 1939 and ending on May 8, 1945. Just for information. It is still a very beneficial movie with very beautiful naval combat scenes, it is already a long time since I had felt this for a recent war movie of the genre (must be specified), I spent a excellent moment of cinema (TV) and which is above all the basis of the positive things to appreciate all the beautiful things which the cinema offers us.

129,maanikroda,"I'll watch this over and over, completely geeked out and grateful for this movie",7,13 September 2020,"There were times where I couldn't help but feel bad for the entire team of Greyhound as they intended this movie for theatrical exhibition. The opening sequence alone conveyed this. The film has little drama, but is high on action and tension. There are very few pauses between the battles, and there were times I was on the edge of my seat. Greyhound had me gripped from start to finish, and its short running time was another positive.Tom Hanks spearheads this war-themed action film that hardly deviates from delivering explosive entertainment. The visuals are outstanding, and the special effects look impressive. Whether it's explosions, torpedo firings or just ships sailing with full intensity, Greyhound completely holds your attention, and it can be enjoyed for that alone. Performances coming from all actors are fine, although it's true that the camera seems to focus more on Tom Hanks' face, thus making him the first one to have his performance lauded.Director Aaron Schneider has delivered a much needed summer action blockbuster that entertains, thrills and leaves a strong impact. I was also fairly surprised when I read Tom Hanks' writing credits; he has done an excellent job at both writing as well as acting. And one more thing, the background score. It was really exciting and suspenseful at the same time. So, while I did feel bad that it couldn't make it to cinemas, I'm glad the makers of Greyhound not just embraced the new medium because they had to, but also because their content was strong enough to work anywhere.

133,just_in_case,"Acceptable hollywood apology for ""Midway""",7,6 August 2020,"The first thing I thought leaving this film was that my pallet was finally cleansed of that abomination of a film ""Midway"". Greyhound is everything Midway wasn't. It's well paced, streamlined, uses CGI appropriately and felt mostly ""real"".I don't think it's fair to lump together the greatest generation and baby boomers as the singular audience for this type of film. I think a well done war movie can be for anyone, as well proven by films like 1917 and Saving Private Ryan. That said this film can be described as stereotypical of the kind of film demographics who have experienced times of war or are war buffs would enjoy more than the average audience.Greyhound is barely an hour and thirty minutes in length. If I recall correctly it retells the 36 hour journey of a supply convoy escort between air support deadzones of the Atlantic during WWII. The Convoy is being hunted the entire journey by a squad of german u-boats. Nearly every second of the films run time is spent engaging in battle or the greyhound dealing with the aftermath.This is both to the films credit and somewhat a weakness. More often than not it's the interludes in war films that ruin them. Greyhounds creators have somewhat bizarrely chosen to just not have them at all. In lieu of the quiet moments, to the films credit, there's constant subtle nods to the heart break and exhaustion experienced by the captain and crew. The captain is awake for so long, he inadvertently thanks members who have died, his feet bleed from standing, an endless stream of coffee comes in and out of the picture.You'll notice it sounds like I'm praising the film, but it does suffer a bit from feeling less solid reality at times.This comes from two detriments, the first being that I'm sorry to say it really could have used just a pinch of drama. It didnt need to be 3 hours long or anything, but man I was thirsty of just 10 minutes of characters talking about anything other than the problematic radar or radioing the other ships. It felt like every character had ""something"" to say and I would have liked to hear it, even if just a bit. This instead was just shy of being one of those war re-enactments you see in documentaries.The second, and this is a minor nitpick, but the CGI ship battles were a bit rough and obvious. I understand, this was not done on a huge budget and to be clear the CGI looked fine, just noticeable. In a perfect world I'd have liked to see more practical effects.Easy recommendation for anyone who just wants to get absorbed in a WWII action film for a couple hours.",Greyhound

The movie abruptly and magically ends. The excuse for ending the plot may fool some but not me. This movie is unfinished.$50M to make an 80-min movie on a ship? They did not even spend money on advertising it due to covid-19. For this movie to be worth more stars it needed to be at least 25-mins longer or 40-mins longer if possible.Had the film been longer I would have happily given it a 9/10 at least.Tom Hanks did his thing; no complaints from me. The other men in the film did fine. The woman was underwhelming and had zero charisma; bad casting there.The German submarines felt like great white SHARKS and the U.S. ships felt like humans, and the plot felt like humans forced to swim with great white sharks in the ocean. Common sense dictates the sharks will win and in real life that is what happened. The submarines massacred the U.S. and allies forces on the water for almost 6 years.Battle of the Atlantic (aka swimming with sharks) spanned almost 6 years and as expected the U.S. and allies had losses many many times that of the Germans. And that is why humans do not willingly swim with great white sharks, but unfortunately that is what they had to do back then at an extremely high cost as expected.Conclusion: I liked this movie. I enjoyed this movie. And I was left wanting more after its sudden end. It raised awareness about the 6-year-long Battle of The Atlantic. Tom Hanks was great to watch. But after 1hr. and 20mins. this film was abruptly stopped and clearly left UNFINISHED. This film should have ran for at least another 25-40mins.

Greyhound was just plain great entertainment, and it exposes a period in history that younger people and other dimwits know nothing about. This time and effort was critical to the allied victory over evil in WWII so the sacrifices were critical to today's freedom (or what is left of it.) It is incredibly well done, realistically suspenseful, and it is highly recommended.

There is one scene with him meeting the woman he wants to marry, of whom he thinks later. Besides that, there's 1.5 hours of technical marine slang.

NO just knowing he had a loved one was enough.Did we need to know the backstory of the crew ? NO the film depicts that the crew did their jobs with focus and order.There are no stupid heroics just a crew who are trained and who know their jobs and get on with it.There are times when just a look on a nervous crewman's face can tell a thousand words and these men kept their mouths and feelings shut as it was all about surviving and getting through the crossing.A battle between a U-boat and a destroyer is a difficult thing to depict from just the one perspective but the film did an amazing job with this.The music had a tension without being overly dramatic, although I did find the U-boat sound/score a bit cheesy ( whale noises ) especially after the 3rd or 4th time.At a runtime of about 1hr 25mins not including credits it is a compact movie that never stops, just like the crew could never stop during the crossing.Also to the morons saying their were no blacks in the navy, this is not true. While blacks could not serve as military men at that time in the navy they were used as chefs and other menial jobs such as loading the boats etc.A very good watch that may not please everyone.8/10.",Greyhound

Violence is restricted to the shooting of cannons machine to machine.This will frustrate the viewer if you cared a lot about accuracy: the survivors of the uboats are surprisingly left unscathed, at least their demise is never shown on screen, while the wounded on the allied side are evoked, never shown.Ironically, for a movie who clearly prides itself on its accuracy, the plot line and characterisation are paper thin - this movie could be summed up in one line.

In this movie the submarines do the total opposite of what submarines normally do. If they were the rabbit to the destroyer being the greyhound, as soon as the race was started the rabbit would run up to the greyhound instead of running away.Submarines do not (unless severely damaged and forced to do so) fight on the surface. They do not roam about with their periscope permanently stuck in the air. The commander raises it, takes a quick bearing, then lowers it.Greyhound is more like a fast paced, unrealistic video game and a waste of money. The war in the Atlantic was terrifying.

After a short opening scene in which the captain has a boring conversation with his girlfriend, suddenyl we are onboard the destroyer Greyhound. Fasten your seatbelts! Immediately, (and I mean literally immediately) the ship is attacked by a German U-boat. A huge battle begins. Looks like every other sea battle ever put into a war movie. After a while, the Greyhound sinks the U boat. At this point, you'd expect the real movie to start, right? You know, interpersonal conflicts, maybe some flashbacks, some no-battle tensions to be resolved later, etc. Right?
Nope. More U boats attack. More battles ensue.... and finally the end comes, with the Greyhound and most of the convoy still floating. THAT'S IT. We learn nothing about any of the characters, we don't care at all about any of the characters, (including the Captain.) They literally never even show any character or scenes on any of the other ships, or at command headquarters, or in England, or..... Literally the entire movie is scene inside the Greyhound in its command deck, or the view FROM the greyhound out to see. THAT'S IT. I'm not kidding.

159,nagsaptarshi,Tom Hanks is back in form!,8,29 July 2020,"Greyhound is astonishingly fast paced and intense. It's so good to get Tom Hanks back to his pristine form after a brief hiatus. The Post merely belonged to him. The story of how a US Navy Captain lead an allied convoy which is being targeted by a pack of Nazi U-Boats from America to London in the middle of the WWII is the story of this thriller. The runtime is barely one hour and twenty minutes which makes the watch even more enjoyable. There are scenes where you will literally be shell shocked and soon there will be moments when you will start clapping. Tom Hanks does a brilliant job as Captain Krause. He is also the screenplay writer and does a brilliant job to present a tight and gripping screenplay. The actors do good jobs even though they did not have to do much. It was the job of Mr.Hanks to carry this movie on his able shoulders and he delivers a subtle yet powerful performance, one that will be remembered for long. The dialogues were a bit monotonous and you really do not expect corny ones in a war movie like this. The music at times sound much similar to that of the theme music of 'Dark'. The character development is one area where some improvements could be made. The story of the captain and his love interest was half baked and looks redundant. The attempt to create a bond between the captain and the butler was weak. However, the fast pace and brilliant visuals easily make amends for such cons and you are left with a wonderful meal on your platter. The scene where two torpedoes come to attach Greyhound was breathtaking. Overall this was a wonderful movie experience. Finally a good ship to hit the sea of OTT platform amidst a plethora of soulless offerings. Would give it 8 out of 10.",Greyhound

As many other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are completely empty, the dialog is composed of steering orders almost in entirety and if you remove introduction titles and closing credits, you're left with 80 minutes of finished film.You will also be left with a good amount of open questions to which the average viewer would have certainly appreciated even the most terse or cursory explanations.Last but not least, the ""enemy"" side is completely ignored, deformed and difamed. The German ubootmänner were valiant, brave and able men who laid their lives for their country, however wrong and atrocious their government may have been.

Right at the beginning we see what bad editing means. The dialogue between Hanks and Shue runs into nothing because the scene is badly edited. Emotions? Zero. Script? Dialogue? Already nothing here. And it goes on like this. For the next 80 minutes or so, we see a studio where CGI is used to trick everyone into recognising it, a leading actor who uses no facial expressions at all to play his role, we know nothing about him or his crew, though we do know, once again, that without the USA the world would perish. The Nazi submarine, the threatening announcements of the wolves, it's all baloney. The men on board look like they're from a modelling agency, all the time staring helplessly at their captain, who is giving some kind of orders to dodge torpedoes. Right, left, whatever. And Hanks, who can actually always be relied on, shows that he can also be a bad actor. Maybe that comes from constantly having to mumble Bible quotes. Apple TV doesn't have a convincing programme, this film proves it.",Greyhound

📜 Plot: A first-time captain leads a convoy of allied ships carrying thousands of soldiers and cargo across the treacherous waters of the ""Black Pit"" to the front lines of WW2. With no air cover protection for 5 days, the captain and his convoy must battle the surrounding enemy Nazi U-boats in order to give the allies a chance to win the war.

👨‍⚖️ Review : Greyhound is serious, well intensioned war drama filled with intricate details of tension , communication and way of war on oceans. The movie is another clear reminder of the losses of war that the world has faced during the World War 2.The Screenplay and VFX with an intriguing BGM sets the mood of an thrilling battle between the German U Boats and the US convoys in the beginning. Tom Hanks is unflinching as a first time captain of US Convoy named Greyhound. He leads the command and is outstanding to say the least. He lives the character.But the movie having so much action, feels souless and lacks the dynamics which makes you feel the tension. The Set pieces become repetitive and the mometum which it gained intially fades down rapidly.

However, with the coronavirus shutting down every cinema and theatre, Greyhound was instead put out on Apple's streaming service which I honestly believe was for the best. The basic synopsis is ""U.S. Navy Cmdr. Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) is assigned to lead an Allied convoy across the Atlantic during World War II. His convoy, however, is pursued by German U-boats"". Greyhound is directed by Aaron Schneider, no clue on him, with a screenplay by Tom Hanks who is also the main star. Tom Hanks has written screenplays before but those were comedies and ""Greyhound"" however is a more serious movie. So I was mildly interested to see what Tom Hanks would produce.Starting with the praises, after watching the movie, I really appreciated the fast pacing of the movie. A fair amount of people might think of this as a negative but I personally believe this worked in the movies favor. There are constantly dangerous encounters for the Greyhound and situations that keep as the audience invested. The action scenes are thrilling to watch even though its just boats shooting at U-boats.I also love the sound design in this movie. Every missile shot feels big, every gunshot is loud and the torpedos flying underwater has an unsettling sound that feels like a ticking time bomb. The effects are also pretty good though noticeably CGI but not to the point that it ruins the movie. The music score does its job in building tension even though it does overuse a lot of the same honking noise every time.A thing I wasn't expecting with the movie was the really realistic take on how these ships are operated during a war. Seeing how the soldiers operated on these warships was very intriguing for someone like me who isn't a serious history buff. The dialogue was very convincingly realistic and I am glad they didn't shy away from the fact that people of African-American Ethnicity were mostly just messed attendants.However, realism also creates some problems as well. Nearly every dialogue in this movie involves some jargon and for the most part the audience would be able to comprehend what they were talking about. Nevertheless, there are a fair amount of dialogue that just feels really confusing to non-army technical people which is a majority of the audience. While I did praise the movie for its realistic take, there is a certain thing in this movie that just kind of took me out of the movie. Throughout, the second half of the movie, the Germans for some reason find the radio frequency and just taunt the Greyhound for no reason except being an over the top villain. It just tears me away from the realism of the movie as it just feels incredibly stupid and not believable whatsoever.This movie also goes through a sort of ""Dunkirk"" way of storytelling which is focusing on the scenario these people are in rather than developing the characters. This worked for Dunkirk but it didn't really work as well here. The film begins setting up Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) by having him ask Evelyn Frechette (Elisabeth Shue) for marriage to give him some backstory but it doesn't really amount to anything by the end of the movie. Ernest Krause is a such a straight-up military man that it makes him a very boring protagonist to watch. It worked in Dunkirk as we can see the main character's personality and their struggle for survival. In Greyhound, however, a majority of the characters are very lacking in any personality which makes it less interesting to watch when they are talking.Additionally, there isn't really any dramatic moments that happen in the movie. It justs ""the U-boat has appeared!"" and ""the U-boat is gone!"" for a majority of the movie with some missile shooting. It does this for 90 minutes and then the movie ends. Once the movie ended, I didn't really retain any memorable moments from the movie and just had an ""okay"" reaction.Overall, the movie is all right. The movie succeeds in giving a tense submarine-thriller showing the ins and out of sea warfare that is interesting to watch and engaging enough to keep watching. The enjoyment will come from seeing how the Greyhound sailors deal with the life-threatening situation. It doesn't have compelling characters or story but it does what it aims to do right and that is good enough.",Greyhound

It was like a documentary, lots of battle time but no much human drama. No time given to develop any characters or even make us feel something about these people.
Ships were sinking in the middle of the Atlantic and we never had a look in the horror of trying to survive this. Even Hank's character felt flat. The few scenes with his love interest were rather awkward and didn't contribute much. At one point we were wondering if the captain was in the spectrum or something..Still, if you are a fan of WWII movies I suggest to watch it for the unique perspective of a battle at sea.",Greyhound
176,OzMovieWatcher,The previews showed the best bits,7,12 July 2020,"A very much anticipated movie, but was a bit of a let down. I think the previews showed the best bits.
Tactical accuracy of how the wolf packs actually operated was severely lacking in this movie. I also thought the crew appeared all unsure of them selves as if there were not a single veteran among them.
While I greatly admire Tom Hanks in his previous movies, I don't think this one comes even close to his best performances. His character's apparent remorse for taking lives of the enemy did not wash with what would be the dominant role of an actual battle commander.
The CGI was lacking as well and could be easily picked up it was animation.One oddity I saw was the instrument panels on the Greyhound showed obvious age. The shots of the ship externally showed a modern design WW2 cruiser , so how the instrument panels could show wear & tear with chips and rust areas clearly showed the filming took place on a ship that was much older, indicating a restored ship from decades ago was the film set..I enjoyed the movie, but it did not meet up with my expectations.",Greyhound

Some will say Greyhound should have added another 30 minutes to humanize the sailors to give the viewer more time to emotionally connect with the audience. I disagree and find the brevity of Greyhound to be one of its biggest strengths. The 90-minute run time allows the entire movie to be almost nonstop tension without any filler. Personally, I don't need to know that a sailor had a wife and kids or loving parents back at home to be sad when they are killed. In fact, the part of the movie I found least effective was when they showed Tom Hank's personal life. I found this to be a well-made, tense, and gripping military thriller and top-notch entertainment. Fans of war movies will certainly enjoy.",Greyhound

Tom Hanks gave a good performance and is a great actor no doubt about that but I have a super problem with movie plot here is nothing just unnecessary fight with no complex because of that this film is really dull just about ordinary heroism !!!

184,sackofwhine,A complete bore,3,3 April 2021,"Surprised how bored I was during what looked like a thrilling WW2 flick with state of the art visual effects. Unfortunately Greyhound is far too focused on the technicalities of realistic warfare where the dialogue consists to 90% of accurate technical-battleship-terminology, which will make hardcore youtube historians cream their panties, yet it makes for a very didactic viewing experience. The technical side is fine, the CG water simulations look really good, however the film as a whole just looks really fake, because it is after all practically an animated film. The Oscar nom for sound is well deserved, and as the film is practically a 90 minute battle scene, there is constantly something going on. The blocking of the action is efficient enough, it's just way too generic, unstimulating and forgettable on every other level and Hanks plays such a one-note character, another one of those heroic american boomers.",Greyhound

188,cristinalinderman,An exciting suspenseful war film.,9,12 July 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Aaron Schneider and crew brought an exciting suspenseful war film, a plus for Tom Hanks writing the screenplay. This adaptation is about a first time US Navy captain leading a convoy of allied ships while being surrounded by their enemy the Nazi U-Boats. I loved this film and honestly, when I watched the trailer I didn't expect much but I'm so ashamed to even think it wasn't going to be good because the trailer didn't do it justice. The movie has everything one can hope for in this kind of storyline. After a small flashback scene in the beginning it quickly dives in on the suspense and from that point on it never stops.What a brutal battle, and magnificently structured. Being this his first time, his orders as captain were so sharp even under the extreme pressure of making life and death decisions. I felt through his determination the importance to know what course to take to never lose contact with the enemy. One of the best scenes was when one of them got so nervous that he shouted torpedo and forgot his training to speak the bearing and range, it projects more the reality. The coordination of the enemy was creepy and every time they appear it was kept at that level thanks to the music.The composer Blake Neely brought this film into a full-on suspenseful atmosphere. How eagerly I was for more intense scenes and the music satisfied me with it, so hauntingly expressive. The cast was perfect and the one who deserves the extreme praise is Tom Hanks. He always has been an incredible actor and this performance reminded me of how he keeps bringing his acting skills to a deep level.",Greyhound

Why make a movie about such a thin plot? Now, its rather difficult to make these comments about such dramatic events; but we are supposed here to review and rate a movie, not the bravery of those who fought and died in the events told by the movie.
So my question stands; on top of its thin plot, the movie has virtually no dialogues except a series of orders
""Right standard rudder!"" ""Right standard rudder, aye aye!""
""Steady ahead on 091!"" ""Steady ahead on 091, aye aye!""
""Contact bearing port 015, range 900 yards!""
Repeat the above dozens of times and you have 95% of the dialogues of the movie.

The only thing that could have made this even better, is if it was based on a true story.Instead, this is a fictional story inspired by true events. A culmination of experiences from the multiple trans-Atlantic crossings of thousands of merchant navy seamen and their ally navy escorts during WWII.There is no slow build up to the action. It pretty puts you in the middle of it within 5-6 mins of the movie starting. And best of all, it keeps the tension going throughout.I really like this movie. It's one of those movie that I can watch repeatedly (but perhaps not as much if you're in the Axis side).There is no doubting who the story focuses at - Tom Hank's character. In this movie, the Germans are two-dimensional faceless foes. They serve purely as the enemy in this movie. No in-depth character building. The same goes for the merchant navy.Finally, some of the CGI could be better. From time to time (particularly the wide-angle shots), it looks more like graphics from a very high quality PC game, than a big budget movie.But this is just knit-picking.

You basically payed money to watch something that bears an uncanny resemblance to an ad for a WWII-themed browser game and is just about as involving.It's not so difficult to make a movie about naval warfare exciting. The setting is the main ingredient. Intense paranoia of the invisible foe surrounding our likeable heroes in the quiet moments interrupted by tense, chaotic action where they are put to the test. That's pretty much all you need. Now Greyhound on the other hand took the bold step of droning on endlessly, feeling easily twice its length and wasting all the potential of charisma fountain Tom Hanks who looks like he just wants to sleep.Maybe we finally did it. After 80 years of cinema on the subject maybe we've finally run out of WWII stories.This doesn't exist to entertain you, enlighten you or tell a story. First and foremost this movie exists to fill up space on the buffet called Apple TV+, yet another streaming website desperately struggling to find any resemblance of identity. I'm happy people are getting work during the covid pandemic but you never get the feeling anyone involved here was excited to be a part, just glad to be working.

The idea of transporting the audience to the location, worked great. I give praise for the authenticity for the repeating dialogues. The sneeze scene and guy reading sonar signals were fantastically done.The battle were fabulous and did get me pumped, but some were hard to follow. The big wide shorts at start had names of other ships, it would have been better to point the other ships at others times too as it was confusing during battles and wide shots, theatre experience would have been best.Loved the UBoat Score and the teamwork that goes into maintaining the crew.

218,michaeljpfitzgerald,Some odd choices for a precise film,2,13 July 2020,"Most of this film's failures are outside of the tense, somewhat grinding combat, which I think were excellently rendered and plotted. The film and Hanks do a good job of expressing the anxiety of naval combat - the sweeping, indirect nature of the conflict, how enormous most of the distances are, the burden on command to maintain awareness and make decisions. Special attention is paid to Hanks' stamina and fatigue, which a long with a handful of silent moments in response to terrible things, stand in for most of the captain's character.The rest of his character is a perfunctory, habitual sort of faith that I am familiar with seeing someone live, and find peculiar as a choice for a film. Hanks' faith, here, appears to mostly be going through the motions of prayer, because there's so very little else of him on display.Where the movie falls apart for me is in how disinterested the film makers are in the reason and context for this crossing and subsequent battles. In a moment where fascism is once again on the rise, and America is the ground it springs from, a great deal of care seems spared to avoid offending any Nazis that might be watching.Indeed, when Hanks' ship manages to sink one of the uboats that is hunting them - all completely devoid of Nazi iconography, in another choice that seems so strange I spent a little while trying to research if the Nazi navy specifically didn't depict the swastika...the absence was never mentioned - as men start to cheer their victory, Hanks looks crestfallen, and makes a point of mentioning the Nazi dead among those the conflict cost.The immediate sensation is that of a studio not wanting to offend one of its target audiences - that being, I suppose, American fascists and neo-nazis. So the context is drained away, which combined with the aimless vastness of the ocean, and lack of any visual reference points, establishes the film as sort of...seeking vacuum. Which, again, seems extremely inappropriate as White Supremacists grow bold on our soil.I'm not much for the jingoism of war, but a great number of people, largely civilians, many Americans, were murdered at sea by Nazi uboats - it seems peculiar to simply borrow the form, submarines, without then instilling in them the horror they represented.One of the most successful motifs in the film was the eerie, tortured whale noise that played when the uboats, particularly the Grey Wolf, came on screen - it gave them a profound menace. Which made it very strange when, with 25 minutes or so to go, the crew of the Greyhound confront and sink their nemesis...and no one really says or does anything. It just sort of happens, and then they go back to steering the ship.Realistic? Maybe. But sort of crap as a film, especially *knowing* the context of when this film is set. In ten years, if a younger person happens on this...there will be nothing to mark it as taking place in a global war against evil. It's just...some boats, and a very tired Hanks, seemingly intended to appeal to conservative christian audiences bc he says his prayers before having breakfast?The bulk of this movie, the fight, would have gotten 5 stars from me, which is quite good, but the choices made about...everything else, really lay it low. I think this is an interesting movie for naval history fans, bc it *appears* to do a good job with the difficult levers that must be worked to fight with a ship.

But,sadly, it didn't. Indeed, if you are old enought remember all those great WWII naval movies (mostly from Britain) that came out in the 1940's and 50's this would not raise your heart beat the way those did.

221,thokocnamangale,Makes you wish it was longer,8,25 May 2021,"It's honestly shocking thinking of the rate world war movies are being made, some completely true stories or loosely based on one, each coming out a great watch. Makes it feel like history still has a lot more to offer. A simple movie yet so enticing. I usually hate it when movies make scenes with near misses in life or death scenarios but Greyhound made it seem so realistic, they didn't over do it. All the scenes are paced out nicely, nothing feels rushed or slow and the acting was great. The Germans' intimidation(voice) was amazing, I don't know if it was actually like that during the war but that really stood out for me.The movies only just over an hour and a half but it feels much shorter because you want it to keep going on.",Greyhound
222,yooniverse,Intense but falls short,6,19 July 2020,"It's based on real life events, so I realize you can't really embellish it like an entirely fictional film. But you see some attempts at character-building, but in the end, no character really stands out or has any depth. Characters are just discarded--the wife (played by Elizabeth Shue for all of one scene and a flashback), the first officer, crew members, etc. It just becomes a series of naval combat action scenes. As many reviewers have commented, the movie feels like it's too short and missing something.There is a hint of something there--the frustration, dread, and the conflicting emotions of having to make difficult decisions of protecting a large convoy with limited resources. But Hanks plays a captain who supposedly is an inexperienced commander on his first command, having to face the full onslaught of an experienced German Wolf Pack--the problem is, he is so calm, collected, precise and intuitively makes all decisions correctly, it's not believable. Again, it's entirely feasible that the real life captain was exactly that and this was an extraordinary accomplishment, but as a movie, he just comes across as any commander with exceptional anti-submarine warfare experience, with none of the vulnerability, fear and doubt. The ""cat and mouse"" hunter vs. hunted tension that one would come to expect from a movie involving sub combat feels somewhat lacking.The action sequences are very good and seem realistic. But in the end, there's not a lot of substance, and you won't feel very emotionally invested in any of the characters, the way we've all felt watching movies like Saving Private Ryan, Das Boot, Fury, or any number of excellent WWII movies out there. It's certainly not a bad movie and enjoyable to watch, but understand that it's very limited in what it portrays.",Greyhound
223,smoothrunner,just a commander doing what he must and a team whose lives depend on his decisions,9,11 February 2021,"By far the best movie of 2020 and one of the best ""war movies"". The ""Greyhound"" is as free as possible from Hollywood clichés, from vulgar melodramatic ""characters development"", fake moralizing and grotesque action scenes. And this is paradoxical, since the entire film is a continuous action that ""grabs"" and does not let you to the end. This is because the ""Greyhound"" strives for maximum truthfulness, does not speculate with pretentious phrases, does not seek to ""squeeze a tear"" from an audience with melodramatic scenes and does not moralize. We see a sea convoy across the Atlantic through the eyes of a destroyer captain during an attack on the convoy by a ""wolf pack"" of German submarines. We witness the burden and loneliness of power experienced by the commander when making decisions - is it worth to save the crew of a sunken ship, or to leave them to certain death in cold waters and rush to protect other ships from the enemy? How to dodge torpedoes? Should the radio silence be broken? How to outmaneuver a submarine? Sleepless days, lack of air support, feet trampled in boots to blood, numerous small and important decisions that entail consequences, including lost of human lives, put pressure on the captain, burdening him with a load that he cannot and should not share with anyone. At the same time, the captain of the ""Greyhound"" does not hate the enemy, he is a Christian who overcomes his fear and burden of loneliness in power by entrusting himself to God, relying on Him. Captain of the ""Greyhound"" is a ""good shepherd"", a shepherd dog, protecting his ""herd"" of ships from a ""wolf pack"" of submarines. The film is attentive to details and very realistic, it is devoid of sentimentalism, but at the same time, it is extremely emotional, seeking to influence the audience not by dialogues, but by what is happening on the screen, small details without words. No propaganda or false moralizing, just a commander doing what he must and a team whose lives depend on his decisions. 9 out of 10.",Greyhound

The movie just has a run time of 90 minutes of which majority part was entertaining. The positives of this film are the background score and the unidentifiable CGI effects which is used efficiently throughout the movie. There is no acting performance worth mention other than Tom Hanks who fits into Captain Ernst Krause well. Red light scenes,night sequences and the action sequences here and there adds to the quality of the movie making it a watchable one.The only con I could find in the movie is the dullness at some parts rest was good.In the end, Greyhound is an ok one time watchable war film.Rating:67%",Greyhound

227,zanghi_james,Apple and Tom Hanks deliver a well-done but not over-the-top war film that covers an important part of the War,8,10 July 2020,"Generally, when I think of productions about the Second World War, I think about things like the big battles in the forests of France and Germany, storming beaches at Normandy, and Pearl Harbor. I am sad to say I never thought about how the Allies got supplies over to the European theater and how the German Navy tried to stop the convoys.Fortunately, this film gives a good glimpse into that battle the Allied Navies fought. Tom Hanks, who wrote the script, carries this film as a somewhat inexperienced captain of a military ship protecting the necessary supplies being sent to the European Theater. There's some pretty tense action scenes, which make up the bulk of the movie. The special effects and computer-imagery used in the film is impressive, while the music is a nice complement to the tension of the story. An interesting thing I noticed, also, is that the score seems to sound like it has whale sounds in it, which gives it a more ethereal feel.There are some faults to the film, though. Tom Hanks gave the only really three-dimensional character performance, since you find out a bit more about his character at the beginning. I would have preferred some extra scenes where we learn about various other members of the crew and make them more important. Also, the ending to the movie is a bit abrupt and doesn't provide too much resolution for the characters. I would have preferred to know what happened afterwards.Having said all that, I think this is a good film and I would happily watch it again. I had my doubts about Apple's original streaming service, especially it going live about two weeks before Disney Plus went live, but it has rapidly gotten better with impressive productions. I am excited for their upcoming productions, also, mainly their adaptation of Isaac Asimov's Foundation and the next Scorsese film which is rumored to have Leo and De Niro in it together. Apple TV Plus is a good streaming service and I hope they stay active for years to come. And if they keep putting out great material like Greyhound, I think they most certainly will.May the Force be with You!",Greyhound

If you are not a war movie buff, especially WWII, then knock another point or so off, placing it into the below average ratings range. The movie was too short; besides giving it more time for character development. if it had been two or more hours then maybe the audience would have felt a little more strung out and exhausted like the captain did at the end of his 48+ hr. command.

It has been a VERY long time since I have seen such a powerful portrayal of WWII Naval combat. I have nothing but the highest praise for Tom Hanks' latest film, Greyhound.This is a sparse film, unfettered by subplots or extraneous character development. Tom Hanks himself wrote the screenplay. It is 99.9% consumed by the frantic world of 4 combat ships and 37 defenseless merchant vessels entering The Pit, a 5 day wide expanse of the Atlantic Ocean where Allied planes cannot defend against roaming packs of Nazi U-Boats. This particular convoy originated in Halifax Canada. All alone in February 1942 in a sea full of Admiral Dönitz' submarine wolfpacks is not a place you want to be.Tom Hanks is perfect as the commander of the convoy and all of his fellow actors give great performances too. He deftly juggles the life or death decisions that pop up moment to moment and lets you feel the weight of them on the commander's shoulders. His son Chet even plays a minor role alongside him as Bushnell. Once the convoy enters the Nazis hunting grounds, the pace is relentless. The combat scenes are what this film is really about. You really get the sense of what it's like to have only 4 Greyhounds (slang for Destroyers) to fend off ruthless attacks for the entire convoy. Watching the finely tuned choreographed moves of the crews as they work together to stay afloat is a testament to Hanks' screenplay and Aaron Schneider's astute direction.Major parts of the movie were shot on board real WWII destroyers in Louisiana and Montréal. This lends the film a sense of realism that you just can't replicate in CG or on a back lot. Digital effects were used throughout as well, but were well done. Every detail of this movie was meticulously researched and naval tactics were spot on. Even the officers' winter caps are the correct black cover for the period.This is an important story that has been seldom told. During the war itself, information about the Battle of the Atlantic was hard to come by. Part of this was because German U-boats routinely penetrated inland waters in both Canada and the US. The governments involved were afraid of panicking civilian populations and giving away hints about when or where convoys might be bringing troops or materiel to Europe. WWII's longest battle, it lasted from 1939-45. Over 72,000 souls and 3600 ships were lost.Greyhound is currently only available on Apple TV+. All by itself, this movie is worth the monthly subscription fee. Unique on Apple's platform are short features about the film, just like the ones you see on Blu-ray. Watched them all and enjoyed them. I screened it in 4K with my home theatre sound system cranked up to the max. An awesome visual and aural experience. Quality nearly as good as the best indoor cinemas - but much less risky in a pandemic. My highest recommendation.",Greyhound

240,deltaforce7,Good movie that respects history,10,11 August 2020,"These days when uneducated barbaric crowds try to erase our history and our memories of it, this movie comes as a refreshing breath of clean air.It is a war movie that balances between NOT being a mindless ""shoot'emup"" flick full of either patriotic garbage or overflowing with feeble attempts to be liked by absolutely everyone, while it does not dilute itself with excess of stories of some deep emotional trauma (""war is hell"" is something that anybody in ones right mind understands) or by unfortunate means of usually boring side-stories of relationships issues, love affairs, traumatic childhood experiences and such.The war-time story this movie tells is both delicate and bold. It draws a picture of mindsets of sane people sanely dealing with common insanity of war. Characters of this movie do not get hysterical, do not sacrifice themselves both thoughtlessly and unnaturally. At the same time, as a viewer one does not get to feel like the makers of this movie attempt to parade their self-proclaimed ""deep understanding of human nature and psychology"". They do not unleash this often mind-numbing stuff at viewers. As a viewer, you are allowed to absorb what happens on screen and either emotionally share experiences of the characters, relate to them or dismiss them. You are given an ample opportunity to choose for yourself.Maybe this movie could benefit from providing just a tad bit more background of the story of WWII supply convoys. It is imperative to remember that majority of the convoy vessels were those of the Merchant Marine, basically civilian-operated. They also carried thousands upon thousand of soldiers who were helpless in this environment of hostile high sees. So, this WWII convoys war was not one of only navy forces fighting one another.Either way, in my opinion, this is one of so very few war movies that is definitely worth watching more than once.",Greyhound

He's a legend. He's the master at playing an ordinary man who does an extraordinary thing. He's just a good dude. The director does a great job making you feel like you're a part of the crew as you weave in and out the cockpit. This movie has some of the greatest naval combat I have ever seen in any movie, so please try to watch this on the biggest screen you can.However, an important part of any movie is its characters...and this has none. It is a completely plot-driven movie, so don't expect any meaningful dialogue between characters. (And don't expect to know any of their names.) The dialogue we are given is extremely rich in naval slang, which is hard to follow and extremely repetitive. It's 2 hours of turn left, turn right, fire everything, steady as she goes. Besides that, this is a fast-paced, tension-filled 90 minutes of Tom Hanks playing Battleship, and that sounds like a frickin' good time to me.Recommended for: Fans of Tom Hanks, fans of war movies, or fans of watching live-action Battleship.",Greyhound
244,notom-23012,Another re-write of history... ?,7,13 July 2020,"I initially considered this to be yet another attempt to rewrite history by the U.S.A. - it's NOT - it's just fantasy.
This particular incident never happened... but, at the same time, and within the first 10 minutes - they made it appear as though the two British Destroyers were both superfluous and incompetent.
That's a goddamned insult to the memory and legacy of the British Navy - who had far, far more experience than the American Captains, having waded through that particular piece of Hell time and time again.
I'm sick and tired of the U.S.A. attempting to claim every victory, every innovation, every piece of heroism as their own.
We know you did your part, we know it cost you - but consider this - we were at the sharp end right from the beginning... and until you joined the war, you were selling arms to both sides.
America actually made a PROFIT from the WW2 - nobody else did! So kindly don't be so high and mighty with your condemnation of the Countries that were engaged in the War for 2 years already.
..and now to the review ;) - Tom Hanks was, as per usual, excellent - but the entire film lacked any kind of depth for me... we only see the suffering aboard the military vessels and never aboard the Merchant vessels that brooked the majority of the wrath of the German U-Boats.
Every other character was incidental to the destruction and emotional turmoil that Hanks character was engaged in. In truth, I believe that a less studied performance might have enhanced the film - Hanks seems a little too distanced from the mayhem, a little too remote.
Stephen Graham played a superb part - his role, though restrictive allowed him to shine - and his ability to energize a poorly written scene was amazing.
Michael Benz' subdued demeanor and casual skill also stood out.As an aside - if my younger self were to consider a role in a movie, I'd first ask whether Tom Hanks was starring... and if so, decline it.",Greyhound

This movie is so brilliant I watched it 3 times in the one week.The movie is based on the C S Forester novel The Good Shepherd. The screenplay was written by Tom Hanks, who also stars. Hanks plays the newly appointed captain of a US navel ship during WWII, which is part of a multinational fleet protecting supply ships crossing the freezing Atlantic en route to Liverpool. For 3 days the fleet have no air support (known as the Mid-Atlantic Gap), so Hank's ship & the rest of the fleet must protect the supply ships from German submarines. And holy hell, what a nail biting, stomach churning, action filled, suspense driven 3 days they are (particularly the nights), as the fleet cooperate to outwit, outmanoeuvre and destroy the German subs. I think I forgot to breath for 80 of the perfect 90 minute run time. Hanks is absolutely brilliant. He is very good in these fatherly, supportive leader roles. The always fantastic Stephen Graham puts in a great performance.Greyhound (the call sign of Hank's ship), was supposed to be released theatrically, but due to COVID-19 it was released on Apple TV plus instead, which is a shame as this movie deserves a much wider audience.It has been criticised for lack of character development, but seriously who cares this is 80 minutes of full on breathtaking stuff so just enjoy it for what it is.",Greyhound

Too many movies these days are over-bloated and stuffed with filler to stretch the runtime. But in This type of movie, where most of the action takes place in real time, and in such A claustrophobic location, the most tension and suspense is taken advantage of, all from the brevity of its length...in Greyhound, Tom Hanks plays a naval captain leading a convoy of supply ships across the Atlantic, to restock and replenish the Allied forces. His men are forced to chart dangerous enemy waters, and for a couple of days, without any air cover...And this is where the bulk of the movie focuses...It's a tense, somewhat repetitive, but overall effective B movie that shows the details of how a Naval crew operates and the kind of stress these men were under. Tom Hanks is fitting for the lead. He channels old Hollywood leading men like Jimmy Stewart more than ever in this part...Now It is very obvious the movie was shot with set pieces against green screen. So all of the ocean shots and big battle sequences are done with CGI. This, and the film's length, and lack of more characterization, make it feel like almost straight to video fare.

256,vangamer,Close to Forester's vision,8,7 March 2021,"C.S. Forester, creator of Hornblower, is the world's most read naval fiction author and his book The Good Shepherd is the basis for Tom Hank's voyage in Greyhound.Like the book, the movie is lean and totally focuses on a single harrowing convoy crossing in 1942 with USN Captain Krause (Hanks) commanding four naval escorts (two British, one Canadian and his American destroyer) against a two-day onslaught by a Kriegsmarine wolfpack.Greyhound eschews the usual character patter and development of standard war films to document the hard work of a convoy commander leading his own green crew while coordinating all escorts. As others have noted, almost all dialogue uses standard naval orders - and demands for more coffee on the bridge.Regrettably, the script ignored part the book that fleshed out Krause's development. In the novel, Krause, a long-serving peace-time officer, quietly wrestles with self-doubt as he commands Allied captains already seasoned by two years of Atlantic warfare.And while Greyhound does an excellent job of visualizing the chaos of battling submarines in freezing weather on rolling seas - some of the tactics shown seem more cinematic than historic.U-Boats were faster on the surface and would attack merchant ships on the surface (especially at night) as the film shows. However, several sequences have
U-Boats battling destroyers and corvettes instead of submerging, which doesn't ring true.Despite those niggles, Greyhound is a solid no-nonsense delve into the strains of the Battle of the Atlantic. That being said, the best movie on that subject easily remains The Cruel Sea, which I heartily recommend.",Greyhound

You dont understand the navy lingo, the positions of the ships or anything else.Which maybe is good cause I suspect that the tactics make no sense from the germans especiallyOther sub movies, like Hunt for red october, make you understand what's going on much better and keep the tension.

266,juanandonly-80815,A short rollercoaster ride,7,5 December 2020,"""Greyhound"" is one of the best example if you're looking for a movie about ""Battle of the Atlantic"". The film's impression is fierce as the warship during the World War II and the manifestation of naval battle drama and tension was quite delivered. This film had an engrossing plot and the dialogue was very technical and pragmatic that also led to a bona fide acting of Tom Hanks and his company. The movie utterly lacks elaborate and gripping plot development and a longer movie length could've made a better viewing. You could get involved in the movie but somehow wanting a wider range of experience. The movie could give you an energetic vibe like you were playing a naval battle simulation game but by some means looking for a better picturesque representation.",Greyhound

My dad was Navy, and served in the Pacific. He and I watched Victory at Sea together when it aired in the 1950's, when I had only begun to understand it. And several of those with whom I worked over the years, were veterans who served in the Merchant Marine, and survived those dangerous crossings. This film illustrates what they endured in order to lend aid to a beleaguered ally. Tom Hanks, and his friend Gary Sinise have done more, I think, to celebrate the men and women who fought that terrible war than others for whom perhaps it is merely a part of history now. Tom Hanks wrote the script for this film, I see, leaving me to wonder if there is no end to this man's talents. It is a superbly crafted film, in the best tradition of thoughtful and entertaining war movies. And like the best of films it is ""based on actual events."" A Navy vet friend of mine only felt at home aboard ship, he once told me, and nowhere else. I recommend the film very highly, it should not be missed.

She doesn't care, he doesn't care, and no one else seems to care because nothing about that is ever followed up on, so as a result, i don't care.It was set in the Atlantic on one ship, but it was difficult to believe it was a ship, and more believable to consider it was in a sound stage. Actors didn't seem to care, filmmakers didn't seem to care, so i don't care.Ships of the era were renamed to imaginary names, and the CGI was too fast and obvious, it makes me wonder why they spent so much effort scanning real ships in 3D, they didn't care about making it real, so i don't care either.The movie had no point, no real story, just events that happen during a single imagined story of one crossing of the Atlantic (of probably 100's-1000's during the period), no one involved seem to care about telling a tale, so i don't care either.I rolled my eyes at so many of the moments they put in here that just weren't believable, and then realized this was another Hollywood shell of a movie.I came to read some comments and some recommended Das Boot, so I watched that, and it helped wipe the failure of this movie a bit.

It basically only consists of scenes of Tom Hanks on the bridge yelling orders, Hanks looking through windows, Hanks using his binoculars, Hanks sending guys to fetch things from his cabin or Hanks thinking about his girlfriend at home.Talking about characters, there is zero character development, basically no plot and therefore no tension. You do not care what happens to these people because you do not know anything about them, nor does the movie tell us anything interesting about them.What could have been an interesting psychological and tactical duel between the German sub commander ""Grey Wolf"" and the Tom Hanks character is wasted. The German sub commander does not appear on screen, we only hear his voice twice when he taunts Hanks, needlessly breaking radio silence.German submarines also like to surface regularly in this movie, doing drive-by shootings and attacking US destroyers head on, a suicidal tactic that no real U-Boot commander ever used in real life.",Greyhound

According to statistic 130,000 sailors died in Atlantic which Russians lost 13 million solders. It's absolutely not comparable.
The movie is about 1942. In 1942 Germans already lost the battle of Moscow and they will have their major attempt in Stalingrad in 1942 which they will lose. In 1943 after Russians won the battle of Kursk Germans were only retreating.

It was action-packed and really good special effects, but we know virtually nothing of Hanks' character, but that he is a bachelor and master of the Greyhound, and he prays frequently.

If you do then give this movie a miss, you will only be annoyed and disappointed.Sorry for the history lesson but U boats were thin skinned, and their principal advantage was stealth. Sure, U boats did sink destroyers in WW2, but usually when the destroyer did not know of the U boat presence. Once it did know all the advantage was with the destroyer due to its high speed, maneuverability and armament.For a U boat to surface and engage a destroyer with its small deck gun (used to finish off torpedoed cargo vessels etc), would be simply suicidal. I doubt the U boat would last a minute.So it may look good and exciting on the screen, but is a quite ridiculous scenario, ruining the movie for me at least.",Greyhound

Overall, the lack character development that would have you on the edge of your seat like in Hanks' previous World War II forays (most notably Saving Private Ryan and in Band of Brothers and The Pacific being for which he was executive producer) kept me from being emotionally invested. However, that doesn't mean that Greyhound isn't a film worth watching. Unlike Roland Emmerich's Midway, Aaron Schneider's direction of Apple TV+ first venture into full length film is both visually stunning with much better acting performances. Hanks stars as Ernest Krause and is at his best absolute best in scenes commanding the crew of the USS Keeling. Keeping up with Hanks, Stephen Graham (Snatch) as Charlie Cole delivers a strong performance as Krause's second in command as the Keeling traverses the North Atlantic escorting a convoy against German U-Boats (watch Das Boot movie or series for the other side's perspective). While Emmerich's film was based on true events (taking liberties in a few scenes), Tom Hanks' script based on C.S. Forester's The Good Shepherd feels more like a true story even though it us just ""inspired"" by true events, especially the ending paired with Blake Neely's score.

In between there is almost non-stop, well paced and relentless action.Character development is subtle to a fault, and it is a pity that the trailer spoiled the reveal that explained all the sideways glances by crew showing visible doubts about Captain Tom's ability. If you haven't seen the trailer yet, avoid it and dive straight in.The strength of the film, though, is that it has complete command of point of view. Other than a handful of perspective shots, the action is seen entirely from the PoV of the Greyhound, its bridge, CIC. We learn about other ships over the radio and via explosions in the distance.

It does cut out a lot of the slow drama and build up that a lot of these movies have, and it gets right into the heart of the action from the start. For some that may be a bad thing, but i found that it just captured my attention quicker as many movies often make too much out of the prelude to the action scenes.The scenery and CGI was nicely done and Tom Hanks was excellent. This wasn't a fancy movie with a big shocking ending, it was a nice steady action movie. It keeps you hooked and you feel like you are truly along for the ride.

And parts of it were outstanding-ish.... it started pretty strong, but.....as a complete film, it fell flat.It felt more like a mediocre docu-drama focusing on one very small event than it did an epic WWII Naval film. Now in all fairness, I'm sure the current state of affairs forced the production company to cut some corners. It really looked like it was a movie that was only about 60% done...like they had to stop production and somebody decided to just go with what they already had, piece it together as best they could and put it out for audiences. I'm unsure if this movie was originally meant to be released in theaters or not...but for whatever reason, this movie, that looked like it could be a big budget Hollywood blockbuster with an A+ leading actor, somehow ended up on the low tier streaming service Apple+ instead.The story was bland, hollow and predictable...character development wasn't ""subtle"", it was non-existent, and the action scenes were confusing, choppy and awkward.

The main character has no arc, he's just ""there""...a weak mishmash of Navy character stereotypes...without mixing words, he's shallow and boring. Honestly I found myself rooting for the Uboats about halfway though the film, they were at least somewhat interesting. But, like everything else in the movie, they weren't developed to anywhere near their potential. The ending is particularly anticlimactic...it felt like maybe I'd accidently skipped 30 minutes of the movie somehow.The effects were decent...your brain definitely does know it's CGI, but in all fairness, a movie like this probably couldn't be done with good conventional effects on any kind of budget.All in all, it's worth a watch if you have any interest in the subject matter, just don't expect it to live up to the movie portrayed in the trailer. Oh and don't forget to cancel your free 7 day trial when you're so they don't rob you $4.99 for watching this underwhelming attempt at an epic WWII Naval film.",Greyhound

321,GuilhermeTeixeiraSilva1002,Good but not that good,7,5 August 2020,"Its undeniable that the technical part of the movie is perfect, the CGI is amazing and the audience can feel the tension from the hostile environment. This movie is very good to keep the tension through out the movie and it's even better giving in one moment time so the audience, along with the characters, be able to calm down and right immediately there's something that capture our attention making the picture exhausting but in a good way because it gives the chance to connect and actually care about the fate of the characters.
From my point of view the vulnerability of this picture comes from the character development aspect. The movie doesn't dedicate a lot of time to develop the main character (performed by Tom Hanks) personality and the worst part is the antagonist. The movie doesn't present us the German side and we don't even have a view from the villains. The only thing that suggest us the existence of human beings inside the submarines is the radio communication and normally they didn't let a lot of time so we can actually feel the pressure of having someone with the power to kill and destroy the ship.
Beside this vulnerability you can be sure that you will enjoy the movie because the CGI and all the environment is very well done so the feeling of fear remains all the time.",Greyhound

325,patrickkemner,Poor egocentric movie,3,5 February 2021,"Hi!Normally I warn about minor spoilters, but my minor spoilers are basically the entire movie since there is very little happening in it.This movie is of poor quality. It should have been the equivalent of Das Boot but for the escort and the men who sacrificed their lives to protect merchant ships in ww2 but it turned out to be a movie about Tom Hanks. Everything is about Tom Hanks, so much that his own character suffers from it and the other actors have little to no role in the movie. They are just tertiary unimportant characters. We do not care whether they live or die unlike in Das Boot and others. Just to tell you, we have no idea who is who aboard the ship and what kind of person they are... we do not even know who the captain played by Tom Hank is. Extremely poor characters development. Furthermore, there is no story element to the movie. It lacks depth, meaning, and it feels like it is looking for a purpose but finds none. It does not even feel like a movie about people who sacrificed their time and life to protect those who could not.Also, why would people cheer escorts after losing seven ships and hundreds of people? That is so silly. The captain of the merchant ships could have said their thanks, but this Hollytrash ending is stupid.The only positive aspects of the movie are the visuals, albeit no logical and unrealistic, they are nice, and the music which is good.U-Boots surfacing to attack escorts in rough seas while not being destroyed and the submariner having the time to exit their sub, unlock their guns, man , load, aim and shoot them without the escorts being able to do anything is purely ridiculous. The navymen of the entire world must have laugh out loud seeing this farce of a movie. A ww2 U-boat would not be able to use his gun in such rough seas, the sailors would just get swept by the seas too.The movie is way too short too, there is no build up nor do we get to know the crew... as I said, the movie is about Tom Hanks, not about the people on the ship and their life as an escort's crew and its dangers.It is a Hollytrash movie made by ignorant people that have not done their homework by consulting professionnals about submarine warfare. The marine must laugh at this movie big time. If only the movie was about the crew and how they lived their life aboard their ship while under attack, there would at least been that, but nope.After this movie, I am not sure I want to see movies with Tom Hanks anymore...The three stars goes to the people who worked on the music, the visuals and the people who lost their life escorting ships in ww2, I give none to those who made this movie, it feels very amateurish beyond the visuals.A really poor egocentric movi and I am very happy that it did not appear in the movie theaters because it is not worthy to be there.",Greyhound
326,TheBabayaga,Pays homage to an overlooked battle of WWII,8,10 July 2020,"Tom Hanks very rarely disappoints. Compared to his previous WWII outings (Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers), Greyhound is a proudly modest naval thriller - very nicely shot, absent of cliches, with a fast pace, stoic acting and no overuse of cheap special effects.Greyhound has very little story and even less character development. Did this film require the talents and caliber of Tom Hanks? Probably not. Greyhound, at 90 minutes, is a short, simple, straight-talking war film that pays homage to the Battle of the Atlantic, an integral but largely overlooked part of the war. Meticulous in its detail and overloaded with naval jargon, Greyhound is both unassuming and realistic without ever once being boring.I had planned to watch this at the cinema but I'm glad I watched this on Apple TV.

This movie is well scripted, actually, it is so well scripted that I had to go back and listen to what they were talking about.Cinematic: Amazing! We all know that CGI is used, but it didn't feel like it. The light, the shadow, the focus, the waves, the sea, all are amazing.Acting: It is great to see Tom Hank in this role, he's a great actor and rightly chosen for the role. Anyway, all other actors were great. The whole movie didn't have too many actors, but they all played well. However, one thing bothered me was the black butlers. Out of all the people, Apple still had to get two black actors and both were butlers. I think that is not so fair to Black folks, but I understand that Apple has its own masters in the East to please.Anyway, the movie is great, it was only 1hrs 30 mins, and because of that, it didn't waste any scenes with fluffy fillers, idle talks or so.",Greyhound

When you hear the term ""Battle of the Atlantic"" it's hard to visualize it being the vastness of the ocean and all the ships. But this film demonstrates up close and with intensity how terrifying and deadly the battle was.

I don't speak for historicism at all. The graphics are good. Not Pearl Harbor (well, there was almost no graphics, only nature) but looks better than the same Midway.

335,charleski2000,"A great procedural movie, and a great tribute",9,10 July 2020,"This is a movie about the procedure of command. This is an innately more complex task than the more common episodic approach that buries the procedural reality under a mask of plot and character. But this film pulls it off, largely by not shying away from the task.Guess what? Naval warfare, especially the sort of highly asymmetric warfare shown here, doesn't really revolve around the captain demanding more speed while the engineer says she canna take it. If you're looking for a movie that's truly respectful of the labours and sacrifices made in the Battle of the Atlantic, then this is a fitting tribute.Don't expect a character movie, don't expect to spend time below decks exploring the usual stereotypes. This movie is seen through the eyes of the captain, and the captain alone. I can think of very few other films that dare to depict the loneliness of command quite so clearly. There's little time for thought, there's no time to process or even truly grasp the horrors that they encounter (something which forms one of the roots of PTSD). What there is is the fight.The fight is relentless and deeply technical. We've become used to fight scenes carrying a few bits of technical gibberish followed by some visceral and personalised action. There's no gibberish in this film, and the latter consists of the captain cutting his feet on broken glass. The movie, like the mind of the captain, is consumed with the intricate technical and personal demands required to hunt down a submarine at that time. That was clearly the aim here, and the movie has succeeded admirably at showing that particular aspect of this type of warfare. This is not a common way to stage a war movie, but it's worth doing well on a few occasions, and this movie achieves its goal.The reviews show that many come looking for something more conventional, and end up missing the point, which is a shame.",Greyhound
336,petesherratt,Intense action all the way,8,8 August 2020,"After the briefest introduction to the Tom Hanks character we are dropped into the action which does not relent to the end of the film. Dodging and hunting the unseen enemy of U-Boats was never an easy task but when you have responsibility for guarding a fleet of weapons-free merchant ships full of the life blood of food for besieged Britain and troop carriers full of virgin soldiers the jeopardy is ratcheted up to unbearably tense levels. Tom Hanks is superb playing the besieged captain and subtly portrays the vulnerabilities of his character in his role, new to the crew and captaincy, learning on the fly and making impossibly difficult trades with fortune. He is hardly off screen. Stephen Graham is also great as the wily, hard nosed number one. The burden of responsibility for the lives of the crewmen and soldiers is very well portrayed and it is this that is the engine of the intense tension. It's well worth watching but low on complexity, being exclusively a military procedural, but the time just flies by and by the end you may have some insights on the subject of responsibility.",Greyhound

It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tom Hanks is great in this role. He really captures and embodies the captain and leader of the convoy protecting a supply convoy. He really fits the role, because he is the aged captain, leading a ship of young sailors. It really shows how he strives to lead these kids through a harrowing battle. It really is heavy on history. I grew up on movies like ""The enemy below."" There is so little out there today in this world of COVID-19, so when I find a gem like this, I just have to watch it over and over again. It also stimulated me to do internet research about submarine warfare in the North Atlantic and about the author of the story, CS Forester.",Greyhound
343,johnboescoulthard,Strange film,5,12 July 2020,"Part of me loves the film's simplicity, but really it was certainly lost potential. It is bare minimum feature film length and ought to have been half an hour more of characterisation. Some banter btwn the sailors, some more backstory, and a better glimpse into the captain's future would have been lovely.
Some threads are raised and then lost. A sailor with a cold appears to muck up a few times but nothing comes of it; two sailors fight and nothing comes of it; the captain is a devout christian but that's just his 'thing' and there is no real test or vindication of his faith. It seems like there was a lot more originally that got cut out to bring it to minimum feature length. I'm interested to know why.The film is based on a CS Forester novel, and, like in all Forester's novels, there is a certain degree of revelling in the technical details. Some reviewers here complain about the sailors repeating orders too much and that it becomes a bit of a headache: I see it as giving it a v realistic feeling atmosphere. I would have done with much less of the bland score though. Having the sailors chatter and relay in Navalese over tense silence helps with creating the sort of clammy, sterile, claustrophic environment that would bring it closer to other excellent navy flicks like Das Boot. Cinematography was bad; the CGI was terrible but might have been passable if its use was brought way down in lieu of real settings.
It's truly a B movie but brought to general notice by the cachet of Tom Hanks. What strikes me as odd is that he wasn't merely dragged in to help elevate a cheap war flick: he wrote the thing! It is certainly a film with a curious provenance.I don't see myself recommending this to anyone who isn't a war film buff.",Greyhound
344,Curt-Rowlett,Very authentic special effects and classic Tom Hanks,8,10 July 2020,"Almost any film with Tom Hanks in the leading role will draw my interest. I mean, who else do you want in control of a desperate situation other than Hanks? (Saving Private Ryan, Sully, Captain Philips, Apollo 13). In this role, as the captain of an American war ship during the infamous Battle of the Atlantic during World War Two, Hanks slips easily back into his role of the steady hand at the wheel while catastrophe looms and unfolds.If you like war films, then this one is right up your alley. The filming looks and feels very authentic, as mighty battleships cut through the gray seas of the North Atlantic, while deadly U-Boats prowl, looking for the kill. People who appreciate authenticity will be pleased with the dialog in the film, as they strictly adhere to the use of military/naval jargon while combat situations are unfolding.The film is rather short, so character build up is almost non-existent. But it doesn't feel as if things aren't working in that department, as the action largely just deals with the kind of human emotions that are present in battle scenes.This film is a good addition to your war movie and Tom Hanks collection.

It lacks any depth what so ever. Thrown in is some commentary about the limited role African Americans played in the US navy that felt shallow and was dimly implemented. Tom Hanks does his Saving Private Ryan mark 2 performance, but it lacks anything new and certainly doesn't save this 'ship-wreck'.The CG looked so fake and is so over-used that I thought I was watching Polar Express a few times. With a budget this big they should have gone to sea and captured imagery that doesn't look like it came from a PS4 on steroids.The run time of the film is less than 90 minutes showing how little there is in terms of story. All there is is the battle, nothing more.You will probably get more emotion from watching a documentary.With the great cast and big budget the film makers could have made a memorable war epic about a critical aspect of WW2, but instead we have this uninteresting pile of rubble.

Clark's ""The City And The Stars"".With all but one brief opening scene being at sea, ""Greyhound"" is one of the few newer war films with no flashback female backstories.Watching Greyhound, I thought about ""Pride Of The Marines"" (1945); also a true story but pre-CGI, with the combat a lucid middle between the family narrative at the heart of the piece. All three sections are Oscar worthy. The first is like ""Marty"" (1955), the second as realistic and hard-hitting as the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"" (and done with three actors), and the third is as good as ""The Men"" (1950). By the way, ""Marty"" won four Oscars, ""Saving Private Ryan"" won five, and both ""Pride Of The Marines"" and ""The Men"" were nominated in multiple categories.",Greyhound

It could have easily been twice as long as still want you craving more.Sometimes scenes were a little hard to follow because of the time compression, instantly taking the boat from one position to somewhere far away as quickly as the camera changes angles.Overall I think they did a fantastic job, trying to touch on as many topics as possible in the time allotted.

That makes me realize it is was a joke. The movie was incomplete and was a reenactment. It is qualified to be a documentary if they make some minor Adjustments to it. Tom Hanks was like him.

The character he plays has to deal with his faith as well as his role of a Naval Commander.Stephen Graham is his 2nd in command, apart from the not so good American accent, he performs fantastic in this.Don't get up at the end, watch the closing credits, these men from the Allies were ones to be proud of.Only things is it tells you on the Allies loses, could do with the fact that 9 out of the 10 German U boats were sunk, Shame that's not written at the end to show what the Allies did, a triumph.",Greyhound
367,briner8397,"Exceeded expectations, learned something new, things have changed",8,17 July 2020,"After watching (""screening"") Greyhound:
1. I had modest expectations and it exceeded my expectations. My first reaction to the title and synopsis was ""Great, another heroic WWII movie"" but it's not that at all -- to Tom Hanks' credit. It focuses on one ocean crossing, unvarnished reality, and the context of real life.
2. I would say Greyhound is dialog heavy and almost all situational -- dealing with what's going on rather than backstory, future plans, or personal dramas. And the situational dialog is military command more than I've ever seen or noticed that in a movie BY FAR. How is intelligence collected, transmitted, and processed? By whom? Using what protocols? Is that information embellished, romanticized, or dealt with as focused or unfocused? Are any of the military protocols silly or unnecessary? Not as presented in this movie; they are all absolutely necessary, critical, and productive. A military mission doesn't invite, encourage, or ask for compliance; it's the blood of a team that sinks or swims together (literally while at sea).
3. It occurred to me while watching Greyhound that the WWII type of military conflict is now totally outdated. There is just as much conflict in the world, but literally it's now all digital and cyber. There is no efficacy in shooting bullets or launching bombs or missiles anymore; just disable an adversary's banking system or other critical infrastructure. Disrupt another country's elections and government, or another country's social order by disinformation and micro targeting disaffection and social comity. Today, Russia and China and North Korea and Iran can spend 1% of their military budget on cyber warfare and get 100 times more results. Traditional military operations have become the tactics of another century.",Greyhound

This one does not disappoint. Tom Hanks has a nose for good movie scripts and usually winds up with a really good director and producer crew and somehow manages to round up a great supporting cast.

One would think he wouldn't need more affirmation. Apparently not. As evidenced by three things:1. He wrote a movie with no other big star in it besides him. (I'm pretty sure Tom Hanks could scrounge up some big names to be co-stars.)2. Those of you who've seen it- can you name ONE scene in the movie without Tom Hanks in it? Think about it. ONE? Some individual shots, sure, but complete scenes?3. Can you remember any character besides his that isn't two-dimensional?I get that it's all about the character he plays. But you can do that without *having your face on the screen every damn second of the film*. Someone should write some code to go frame by frame doing facial recognition and check the ratio of frames with Tom's face in it vs any other faces (the special effect shots would automatically be weeded out since we're talking ratio of face frames only.)3 stars because the special effects were good.",Greyhound

It's a great subject that deserves a great movie as a tribute to those who survived and those who were lost in one of the European theater's most important battlegrounds. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice as captain. Elisabeth Shue was also a great casting, who deserved much more screen time than she was given. But there wasn't really any character development, and the script and direction made the characters feel stilted and frozen. The special effects were also subpar for today's standards. The movie felt rushed to me, and could have used an extra half-hours worth of time to give the characters more depth and development time, especially for both Hanks and Shue.",Greyhound
373,Monstrel,"Great naval movie, without usual Hollywood nonsense",10,13 July 2020,"This is one of the best naval movies that I've seen (along with Das Boot). Tom Hanks was upset with the quality of naval movies in Hollywood, so he wrote the screenplay himself, and he sure did a right thing (see virtual interview with him about the topic).
This movie shows the real life on the bridge of the destroyer ship, fighting the pack of German U-Boats while protecting the convoy on the way across Atlantic. The movie is packed with action and suspense, I watched it in one sitting, holding breath and didn't notice how the time passed. And the CGI of the ocean and the sea battle is amazing! The view of the cold stormy Atlantic and the ships breaking through it's massive gloomy waves wile firing tracing ammo at the U-Boats gave me shivers...
This is not your usual Hollywood movie with lots of blood, gore, obligatory love story and nude scenes, and it doesn't need all of those things. It keeps you nailed to your chair waiting what will happen in the next second, what Captain will do and how the enemy will react. And it's so true-to life, you don't need to understand much of the jargon on the bridge, but it's the real thing - what sailors used to say and do in those situations.
Tom Hanks did an awesome job for both his role and screenplay. The story is told from the Captain's point of view, following the book that the movie was based on. Other characters are not so prominent, but actors do a great job too, creating a proper story mood.
This movie is similar to Das Boot (my all-times favorite) though Das Boot is longer and more gloomy/dramatic. Now you can watch the story from both sides - the underwater (Das Boot) and the surface (Greyhound) and from both enemies points of view. Those two movies complement each other. If you like Das Boot, and enjoy ""no-nosnsense"" sea battle stories, I really recommend you watch ""Greyhound"", you will not be disappointed!",Greyhound
374,jon_mirow,"Good peak into the battle of the Atlantic, but a bit short, Hollywood and not edited well for TV",8,31 December 2020,"Whilst it can't escape the trappings of US WW2 movies completely - the Germans are crazy evil, the Brit are incompetent but die with a resolute stiff upper lip, and the American captain can save the day with his one-of-a-kind instincts even on his first time out - it is way toned down compared to what we came to expect from Hollywood 20 years ago. Of course, it's still Hollywood so the timing and some of the set pieces of the battles will still have you saying 'oh come on!' But I'm not convinced that's entirely a negative.That aside it does a great job portraying the horrors of the battle of the Atlantic to a newer audience than are likely to be aware of it. Tom Hanks does a great job yet again as captain of a vehicle in distress (what an oddly specific type casting), and overall I really liked it. As others have said... it wasn't a kids movie nor made for the VHS era so why is it 90 mins? I get the impression something may have been lost on the cutting room floor that could have made it a 9/10.Only other slight quibble is that it was clearly shot and edited with the big screen in mind & would have benefited from having been shot from the beginning with a home TV audience in mind, but it's a small knit pick",Greyhound

Those men were no superheroes, just ordinary men, thrown into a situation that no man can withstand.
They have no time for chitchat, or jokes, or moral discussions.
They were fighting for their lifes. The slightest misjudgment could make the difference between life and death.

They just don't work if you don't have one. An admirable performance also from the excellent Stephen Graham as Exec Officer Charlie Cole.God, even the CGI was brilliant. The ships looked real, the waves looked real and the battle sequences show exactly how far the tech can take you these days if used properly.Anything less than a 10 and you're hard to please.

Just a pure WWII Navy Action flick to be enjoyed from start to finish. This was my first time experience of witnessing a Naval Warfare on Cinema, I did see German Movie Das Boot (1981) but that was more about the life inside a German submarine, this one had all the action needed for a war movie. But Das Boot certainly complemented my experience of Naval Warfare as I had seen it beforw I saw this.As the movie length already suggested that it won't spend anytime on explaining about characters of the movie, so this movie starts right in the middle of the action. Hence I find it worthless in brooding over the point of 'lack of story' or 'No character development' as it mostly being said about the movie.The only thing that goes against this movie was the techincal Naval language that's been used some of which got over my head, but in the end it gave me satisfaction that I have seen something worth my time.The most unfortunate thing to have happened with this Tom Hanks flick is that it was tailor made for Cinematic Experience specially IMAX, what a tragedy that we have to see it on our TV sets thanks to Covid pandemic.

382,eaveschristopher,Tension Driven WWII Naval Combat Missing Human Element,7,22 July 2020,"Greyhound Micro Review -From 1942 until 1944 the battle for the North Atlantic raged between roving wolfpacks of German U-Boats and Allied Supply Convoys racing for England. Greyhound is told from the perspective of a United States Destroyer Bridge defending against U-boat attacks. The film is dedicated to, and phenomenally depicts, this visual execution of naval combat which creates a great deal of tension. Unfortunately, the film is held back by its limited character work restricting Greyhound from growing beyond the situation.There is surprisingly little character building and due to the identical military uniforms I cannot tell you about any supporting character other than the ship's cook Cleveland. Ninety percent of the film follows Hanks (Ernest Krause) rushing from port to starboard and back again amidst the battle. I believe Hanks did portray a character but most of that work was absent from the final film.I enjoyed the film for what it presented although was left wanting more from the premise. While the film is written by and starring Tom Hanks the direction of Aaron Schneider forgets the human element. To compare Greyhound to the other WWII Hanks film ""Saving Private Ryan"" Greyhound lacks the conversations in the church and Damon's pre-battle story moments. Greyhound is well produced and creates tension with the battle but fails to deliver a feeling of dread through characters to empathize with.",Greyhound

Some people criticise the special effects however my small screen everything seem to look as it should, again a pity I couldn't see it on the big screen. Story wise it is very procedural however I think in keeping with the story this is appropriate there is no fluff around the edges which is after all probably what killed the movie Pearl Harbor, Please this was on my iTV free subscription when I bought my new phone.

This movie shows the true spirit of a Naval Officer,his mental awareness and great Captaincy,in a very topsy turvy situation,across the Atlantic.
Getting chased by German U-Boats and the heart ripping sledging done over the radio communication,shows a very dark psychology which is hidden in the war scenes.
It clearly says something like ""Either you get out or we chase you out"", a message which most of the German commanded U-Boats would be telling the British.

Through the eyes of the Captain, you see and wonder how in the hell one brain can take in the danger coming from all sides and deal with it. What is apparent though is that he makes all these decisions based on the professionalism of the sailors surrounding him. They are the strands of constant monitoring and information passing that make this so compelling a watch. The constant bombardment of danger. The ever pressing need for sleep and food.

The battle scenes were tense, and the movie shows to great effect just how nerve wracking WWII naval combat was. It also was accurate for the most part, to naval protocol and procedure. However , Tom Hanks at age 64 is just too old for the part. Destroyer captains were likely mostly in their 30's in WWII. There was also just too much of ""Left Full Rudder"", or ""All ahead flank"", almost endlessly, for my liking. The part about the Germans using the radio to taunt the American sailors was ridiculous, so also the fact of having a submarine engage with destroyers on the surface.

Good action and intensity start to finish though. Pretty much all naval action except for a few minutes at the beginning and end. Very little in the way of character development. Does not really show anything from the perspective of the U Boat crew which was perhaps a missed opportunity. I'm not sure how realistic a depiction of Atlantic warfare it was, probably not very, but it didn't feel like complete over the top Hollywood silliness either.

I did have trouble understanding the dialogue when Hanks was being soft spoken with the background sounds wiping out what he said. I am a Navy vet, so the dialogue was, to me, right on.

It is the other way around. That is what destroyers are for... to destroy submarines.The German submarines have conning tower insignas that look like satanic metal band logos... completely out of place.Some German captain keeps taunting the destroyers and howling like a wolf over the radio.... when everybody involved would suddenly know where the submarine surfaced to do that. There was a reason why submarines didn't always use their radios, it revealed their position when they did. It would basically spell a death sentence for that submarine...... just like surfacing right next to a destroyer would. The movie is trying to make us believe that a surfaced submarine is a match to a destroyer. It would basically result in a sunk submarine very fast.You know what I don't get here?

But I've read tens in not hundreds of books written by war submarine and destroyers commanders or historicians and I feel this movie is nearest to perfection of any other movie I've ever seen. Shortness of this movie made it harder to understand in technical matters but also cut all unnecessary sociological (and so on) dramas (except of shaking hands and tight boots, but the last one is so pure Polish :D).

The great details of how the command structure worked.
No back stories or boring character building.

If the film is legendary, I will definitely be aligned with it, but there are some points that the film avoided. A true scenario, a free confrontation in World War II. An interesting idea, but I wish I had. There is a bright side to the characters and more expansion in the dramatic scenes because, honestly, the film is an hour and a half, and yet I felt very bored and did not hide you. I fell asleep in the middle of the film, it was necessary to mention and the emergence of some characters in a larger and clearer way, such as the enemy is not just hearing his voice but filming it up close. The visual effects are very good. The soundtrack is just normal. The music is breathtaking. It was beautiful and I did not see a big difference between the actors, that is, I did not notice that the film starred Tom Hanks, meaning all the actors are as if they are secondary actors with one stability in the same class, in the end the film is suitable for lovers of war films, especially those interested in politics And real-life war stories, 6/10 my review for this movie",Greyhound

The epic disasters of recent years thanks to CGI and quite frankly bad cliche writing has made most recent war movies that of the Ben Aflack vomitable ""Pearl Harbor"" quality but thankfully not this movie. The director and the writers have forgone the outrageous battle scenes and cocky arrogant Mavericks and made this a more true war movie which is more realistic and enjoyable to watch.Greyhound gets started pretty fast and stays that way to the end which is great. Tom Hanks just completely pulls this character off, but what else is new, and the supporting cast do an excellent job. Which just add to the quality of this film.The downside to this movie are two things: 1. This should be his last crossing for Hanks not his first. if you watch it you'll see why I say this and you will see how this first point is also important for my second point. 2. The movie should end with the suggestion that both the Elizabeth Shue character and the Tom Hanks charter suggest at the start of the movie. Otherwise, as the Big Bang Theory character Amy Farrah Fowler says about the worth of Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, ""The outcome is no different whether Elizabeth Shue's character is there or not."" This is not Elizabeth Shue's problem, she is a fine actor and needed to be utilized much more in the plot, this is the writers and directors fault as it seems they needed to add 10 minutes to a script which was already relatively short movie. The addition of this sub plot was most likely to meet the minimum length requirements of the contract they signed with Apple which is a weird thing to say in a movie review but seems the only logical assessment of why the heck she was in the movie in the first place (Hey Director am I right?).",Greyhound

After the first three minutes, you are there with the Greyhound crew in the icy North Atlantic.I was surprised by lukewarm reviews until it became blatantly apparent that some of today's audiences requires everything meticulously spelled out. Nuance, raw emotion and expression escapes them. Perhaps in part to short attention spans and an inability to empathize, it couldn't, as Hanks lamented, it premier on a big screen as he'd so wanted...
Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor, a stellar writer and from all reports a great human being. What he gave me tonight was a brief escape from the fear and isolation that has become a way of life for those of us who are highly susceptible.Bless your heart, and thank you for this wonderful gift, Tom.P.S.

What I did not understand? There were some holes. I didn't understand why the first night 5 boats went down. The second night was a free pass. There was a reason but what was it? There were lot of non verbal exchanges between the navymen that went over my head. Those glances were supposed to mean something but wasn't clear to me. War is politics driven and the men who fight are following orders. I had nothing against the German navy who were following orders and I would have liked to see this from there angle a little bit especially the packs lead. The last ten minutes of the movie seemed unnecessary. Tom hanks scenes with Elizabeth Shue were cringy. All of this is my opinion. Take it for what's its worth.

470,kbx1,Boring and cliched,5,30 July 2020,"Lack character development, depth and characters backstory to make some kind of bound between viewers and them but also between characters. It just feels like one naval battle, there is no room to see how the characters are changing, mature, how the war leaves its mark on them and so on. As a result you dont care about any of them. Lots of mediocre CGI. Lots of things that made me laugh and felt unrealistic, ubots like alot to emerge in close distance and even fight with 2 destroyers while beeing damaged and on the surface, german submarine commanders like to howl like wolves over radio etc. To sum it up it feels like CGI based short video. If you expect good marine/war tale and human drama you will be disappointed.",Greyhound
471,frucklish,Exhilarating and brief,6,3 August 2020,"While Greyhound isn't exactly breaking any new ground (bars) it definitely does its subject matter more justice than one would expect considering its 90-minute runtime. The battle scenes are exciting enough to keep you consistently invested, with extra care given to the film's accuracy. Each action sequence is fast-paced but with so much happening at once that it feels like you're really there, being bombarded with this information from all angles (in the least overwhelming way possible.)My issues with the film mostly lied with a lacking narrative and scarce character development. It seems as though the action was so prevalent that the story and individual characters often got left behind as a result, so that when things would happen to certain characters or we were reminded that their existence was purportedly essential to the plot, it was hard to really care since so much focus was given to the boats. Elisabeth Shue's character felt particularly inessential, which was perplexing considering she was one of the top-billed cast members. However, it's clear that the takeaway isn't meant to be about the story, so I'm willing to look past it.My biggest issue had to be with Tom Hanks playing such a forgettable role. I won't deny that he does it effectively but it's just a shame how much his character seemed to fade into the scenery and hubbub.So while this film probably won't go down in history as one of the more notable WWII films of the century, and I don't plan on rewatching it any time soon, I wouldn't knock it 'til you try it.",Greyhound

473,briandfinley,It's Lonely At The Top...,9,2 April 2021,"I saw another review that complained about ""little effort at any sort of character development"", which is accurate enough, but doesn't come close to capturing the essence of what this film is about. The source material, C. S. Forster's novel ""The Good Shephard"" is a third-person narrative that details what the Hanks character, Commander Krause, is experiencing in the moment over a period of three or four days. It is a tersely economical war story that focuses on the mechanics of how this part of the war is fought, and how command decisions have to be made deliberately and swiftly, with terrible consequences if errors in judgement are made. This is not ""The Winds of War"".The film tells much of it's story visually, with the bulk of the dialogue being Commander Krause's orders given to his crew or to ships captain's on the other escort. Krause has a few confabs with Lieutenant Commander Charlie Cole (very ably played by the terrific Steven Graham) regarding their strategic and tactical options, but aside from that, the dialogue is all business. The viewer is left to observe behavior rather than being spoon-fed verbal cues in order to understand the characters. Hanks is brilliant, conveying his feelings of apprehension, remorse, anger and guilt with his eyes and pursed facial expression. It's a fantastic performance.Like Hank's other WWII projects (Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, The Pacific) this is an homage to the ordinary people who undertook this extraordinary work under brutal conditions and the constant threat of horrible suffering and death. I think it's a fantastic movie.",Greyhound
474,Herman-43221,"Stupid historical inaccuracies, jingoism and dehumanising the enemy killed any suspense",2,19 March 2021,"What a shame. It looked so good, it started so well, but it ended as a tiresome embarrasment.Firstly, stupid little things showed a lack of care, or research, unforgivable on a war film. A damaged destroyer using bright torches to survey damage in the middle of the night (as a nice bright beacon to any enemy submarines), a singular inability of Tom Hanks to reply to a report or notification from crew in order to display that he has emotions and the like, and hesitancy from the crew to respond to orders, the apparently bright moonlit night through a dense bank of cloud, shells diving underwater to locate their target like some u-boat seeking missiles, the decision to neglect zig-zagging and planned course changes in a desparate plunge to the air cover against all common sense...all of these stupid things are so blatantly idiotic that i was shouting at the tv. Repeatedly. Every time there was a tense moment. Aaaaargh!And for a film on the epic battle between u-boats, the merchantment and the screening destroyers/ corvettes, it all seems to easy for the destroyers. U-Boats sinking left and right, we briefly see some ships explode but they appear to be a footnote to the whole damn movie. The crew of the Greyhound never seem to be in peril, the merchantmen are incidental to the whole thing and the Greyhound alone sinks 3 out of 4 u-boats they engage (one with the help of aircraft)...with a hit rate like that the war would have been over my Christmas. But of couse the USA is so awesome it can't be seen to fail.But the worst thing by far is the appalling dehumanising of the enemy. Submarines run on the surface CONSTANTLY with no crews on the bridge because who knows, if we could see them, we might acknowledge that the Germans were actually humans (Or maybe this should fall under historical inaccuracies...maybe the producer thought they were looking through the periscope). The weird (completely historically inaccurate) german taunting on the radio, because if we weren't sold on the ghost U-Boats, at least we know they like to delight in the suffering of all humanity like the unhuman monsters we are supposed to believe they are. I see no point to this. We know the U-Boats are bad, it's pretty bloody obvious. Why try to paint them as mosterous flesh destroying ghouls? It's embarassing, and a film i trully hope that Tom Hanks is embarassed to mention in public.The pacing is a missed opportunity. There is never time to build suspense, because another action sequence is upon us. There is a vague attempt to build up a back story for Hanks, but i neither know nor care about whoever that woman is. Why there is a love iterest of whatever that is at all is completely lost on me. It seems like that time could have better been used to make us care for the characters on ship. This film would have benefitted from an extra 30 minutes to slow the pace and make each sudden action so much more abrupt and engaging.And finally, the same problem as ever with CGI... an obesssion of seeing every rivet and detail in every scene, when realism should have taken precedence. You feel like the budget was tight on this film, and it shows.All in all, a wild swing and an embarassing miss. If i want to see a good film, I'll watch The Cruel Sea or Das Boot. Something far less 'hollywood'.",Greyhound

That's what this was.The is a Tom Hanks movie. It's all Hanks, all the time. It mind as will have been with faceless robots because no one else is even remotely given a backstory. There is no story at all. Just lots of ""hard right rudder"", ""hard left rudder"" , and random guys repeating coordinates. Tom Hanks rushes to the left side of the ship, grimaces and looks into binoculars. Then someone yells out new contact info, and Tom Hanks rushes to the other side of the ship, yells out ""hard right rudder"", looks into his binoculars and grimaces. Repeat for 80 min.

Why couldn't they show anything from the German side? At least show some scenes about the German Uboat crew. The only time you knew they were fighting the Germans was when they listened to a German making comments over the radio. The sound is overbearing. You can barely hear the characters talk. When the characters do talk, they mumble and you have to replay the scene to understand what they said. What was the point of having the ship cook (Cleveland) continue to serve food to the captain (Hanks)? Somehow the movie was trying to create some type of chemistry with the captain and cook and somberness when the cook dies. Also, why even have Elizabeth Shue in this movie. She was only in the movie for 10 minutes. They tried to create some type of love interest as part of the movie but it seemed out of place. Besides, she doesn't even seem to have much feelings for the captain (Hanks) when she shows up at a hotel lobby to exchange Christmas presents.

Then read reviews, obviously the lack of history knowledge or history being ignored led to bad reviews.Tom Hanks spent 10 years working on this script. I agree with Mr. Hanks it's a shame we couldn't enjoy this movie on a large screen. But glad I was able to view it today. Simple story, Destroyers escorting ships from the US to England during World War 2. Tom Hanks is the commander of the lead destroyer, Greyhound. We watch the action, after the convoy leaves air cover of the US until British side arrives to cover. Just when you think the action has settled down, it starts again. The German radio traffic, fuels the anger I and the crew felt towards the enemy.My only complaint, not sure why the scenes with Elisabeth Shue were included, or necessary to the story. Their relationship, possibly led to some of his reactions during the battles? Perhaps more between the two of them would have explained it better.Worth the watch.",Greyhound

Elisabeth Shue was the second billed actor and I cound hardly remember that she was in the movie. The dialogues were mainly left rudder, right rudder, all ahead full, torpedo 350 meters and so on, and it cut 4 hours of the night battle, which to me should be the most dangerous and intense part of the movie.

504,heels-54905,Impressive CGI is not Enough,2,18 July 2020,"Special effects and CGI were very good as expected from a mega budget Hanks film, if a bit cartoonish at times. The narrative though was pure Americana - from the captain's fanatical religiosity likely intended to appeal to fundamentalist evangelicals, to the melodramatic 'moments', deep lingering pregnant pauses, and Hank's irritatingly ponderous, morose demeanour.The main weakness with the film was Hanks. The film was made in 2020, and it showed his age. At 62, he came across as an old man suffering from corns and ingrown nails... Much too old for a destroyer commander on his first convoy escort mission. I've never rated Hanks as a great actor. His casting as the captain severely detracted from an otherwise well crafted war film.And then there was the inevitable American triumphalism and exceptionalism which is almost invariably overdone in just about every US war film I've ever seen with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan.Compare and contrast this at times spongy American melodrama with the electrifying Das Boot which encapsulated the utter horror of sea warfare.

507,sebpucher,Torpedoes but no Tension,6,11 July 2020,"The overall problem I have with Greyhound is it's lack of tension. Thrillers, especially war movies need to build the conditions of the plot to keep the audience engaged. The movie assumes the stakes of the plot from the second it starts. The lack of developing the circumstance of a ship being sunk suffers to motivate the viewer into really caring about the events that the characters will endure. This idea is also applicable to the characters: all are hardly developed leaving me underwhelmed in empathizing for them and wanting to root them on. Because the majority of the movie is filmed on a ship, there's little opportunity to get immersed in the setting. This element is especially frustrating for me due to how good this setting could of been. If the cinematography and directing was better, the Greyhound ship could of felt super claustrophobic, conveying a sense of no escape and little hopes of survival. I just never felt the full incentive to care about much of the movie's plot... this is not due to the lack of historical significance, but the lack of the film's ability to fully immerse me into the it's circumstances.

Someone on that gun while under water (not even in Hollywood).Then, the use of water bombs is a puuuure joke!Usually you set those to detonate in a certain depth. Not in this movie!

523,maritze,"A Very Dull, Grey Hound",5,13 July 2020,"It's a bottled movie, shot on basically one green screen soundstage and later dollied up with digital waves and ships. For a war movie there is a surprising lack of blood and gore, which makes this an oddly toothless film. There is also a weird religious subtext that remains unexplored and doesn't add anything to the story. It's just there... much like Elizabeth Shue. She appears and disappears without adding interest or making an impact. It's not her fault, there is just nothing for her to do.There are some tense moments of naval cat and mouse but the overused CGI never allows the film to ever really build on that suspense.Hanks is dependable as always, but all by himself he can't keep this one from sinking.",Greyhound

The battle scenes are hopelessly unrealistic and there's a complete lack of tension and suspense throughout.
If you've ever seen Das Boot or The Cruel Sea you'll know what I'm talking out. Being stalked in the Atlantic by a wolf pack must have been terrifying, but Greyhound just doesn't get close to conveying this.

532,quidam-brujah,All action and subtle character development,8,12 July 2020,"Funny... reading the other reviews is what encouraged me to write mine. Most of the low scoring reviews complain about poor character development or thin plot lines. We've had 80 years of movies giving us lots of historical detail, real or imaginary characters development and simple or convoluted plot lines from the World War II era. This movie didn't really need a lot of that to tell the story it was trying to tell. If you're paying attention, you can see the characters develop as the story is told. You can see the scared people gather their courage, the dedicated and loyal people that ""take one for the team,"" and the dedicated captain who will change out of his service shoes bloodied from days of constant wear into the slippers that his girl friend gave him as a gift.There are plenty of movies that have tried to give you complex stories with multiple plot lines and lots of character development only to fail and perhaps try to make it up in the form of some action scenes. This movie was never about that. The action is first and foremost what drives it, and you learn about the characters through the course of the events of the action. This movie was great for Apple TV+ but, it probably would not have been as great for a theatrical release.",Greyhound

537,film_fodder,Just about earns a 7,7,24 July 2020,"I say it just about earns a 7, but I could easily have given it a 6, which is still a solid score.The good:
Pacing: There is no dull moment in this film, no long intro, not too much fussing at the end. The film maintains a tense atmosphere all the way through, with just enough reprieves to enjoy them.Action: I thought the action was fantastic - guns are inaccurate at best (probably realistic) having to unload everything and watching a good ol' broadside from a ""modern"", albeit light, cruiser is a lot of fun.Acting: top rate, not much more to say on thatCinematography: very nice, seemly GCI such that I really did feel like I was watching something real and gritty.Story line: I like these ""intimate"" stories from WWII - its not a specific major battle, its just a single crossing. But it shows the desperation and danger - on both sides - really well.The bad/not-so-good:
By far the worst part of this for me is the ""creepy"" music whenever the sub...err... u-boats came on screen, especially when they surfaced. It de-humanised the Germans turning them into evil horrors and this coupled with the even more creepy voice taunts just made this worse, and this after Tom Hanks looks quite sad at seeing the first u-boat destroyed underwater... the two are at odds and it feels kind of out of place.Length: I really felt this could have been more of a 2 - 2.5 hour epic. Even though I liked the pacing, this had room for more. I wanted to see a bit more action around the boat - the magazine, kitchens, crew having some down time, sleeping quarters - perhaps not make it into a long drama - but I was left feeling like I missed a lot of detail because most of the film is focused on Tom Hanks / the bridge - which is no bad thing, but perhaps it needed a 10-15 minutes at the start of the voyage for some ""sunny sailing"" where you get to see a competent crew doing their thing (think Apollo 13).There appeared to be some importance placed on Hanks not eating... but nothing really came of it, felt like we where building up to some crises and the food-guy (cant recall his name) or XO would have to put their foot down, but no, nothing happens - Hanks is tired, but otherwise performs exceptionally well all the time, except forgetting peoples names. I think they could have played that part out to develop Hanks's character arc such that by the end he decides to sort him self out and his crew before entering the final battle and past mistakes are shown to be fixed.Summary: Very entertaining, bit short",Greyhound

551,rgrimmig,"Nice CGI, decent war plot, solid acting. I hated it. There is no need for it.",3,17 August 2020,"Greyhound is set during the Battle of the Atlantic, specifically in February 1942. The ""First Happy Time"", the initial phase of great success for the German U-Boats, is long over. The Brits have adopted the convoy system to better protect the freighters and troop ships supplying their besieged island. They have been honing their ASW skills, to which the subs are trying to adapt by using the ""Wolf Pack"" tactic. Commander Ernest Krause (Hanks) has received his first command, the fictional Fletcher-class destroyer USS Keeling, call sign Greyhound. After a few months of work-ups, the time has come to sail his new ship into harm's way for the first time, commanding the escorts of the fictional convoy HX-25 to Liverpool.
There is danger and suspense, well-paced action and tasteful special effects, mostly CGI of course. The film delivers on all the expected sweeping CGI footage of period ships and some aircraft on the high seas, specifically, a British Tribal-class DD, a Polish Gromm-class DD and even a Canadian Flower-class corvette, besides Krause's Fletcher and a selection of period freighters, tankers, Liberty ships and converted passenger steamers. Acting, direction and plot are mostly as solid as you would expect of a Hanks vehicle. I especially liked Stephen Graham portrayal of Krause's No. 1 Charlie Cole, a dead-eyed killer. Using Elizabeth Shue, the token actress in an otherwise all-male cast, for a single short, trope-heavy scene and a couple flashbacks feels like a needless waste of some world-class talent. The only real grievance as far as the acting is the over-the-top Englishness of the British voices which is typical of many American movies. Pip pip! Huzzah, old chum. But hey.
Large parts of the writing also feel very solid, although seeing as Hanks gets a screenwriting credit, he could have gone a bit easier on the praying and the Jesus for my taste.
So why do I hate this movie's guts?
Well, for one, the definitive movie about this sujet has long been made. It is an anti-war film called ""The Cruel Sea"". Look it up. Watch it. It may be black and white and not have CGI and many ships are all wrong, and yet it is head and shoulders above this trillion dollar effort here. Much like ""Play Dirty"" is above so many infantry movies.
But I digress. My second reason is the completely ahistorical portrayal of the mindset of the German U-Boot-Waffe as monstrous, gloating war criminals, in a manner fully consistent with the American state propaganda of the period, which successfully painted these men as despiccable pirates.
One of the German U-boat commanders keeps taunting Greyhound over the radio, in the clear.
Breaking radio silence, several times, on a convoy, was all but inconceivable for German sub commanders back then, if for no other reason than that it would have allowed the convoy escorts to triangulate their positions. Even outside of actual attacks, many of them defied Dönitz' personal demands for updates in order to avoid detection. One single memorable instance comes to mind: The Laconia incident. Korvettenkapitän Werner Hartenstein radioed his position in the clear when he found out there had been thousands of POWs on a ship he had just sunk. He took rafts of them in tow under red cross flags and was bombed by the Allies for his trouble. Look it up.
None of them, not even the most loyal Nazis, would have resorted to this kind of dumb, childish bullying.
I have a hard time coming up with an explanation of why they chose to ruin a perfectly adequate movie this way, seeing as it is bound to tick off historical-minded viewers no end. My best guess is they must have felt they needed to create some actual villains, not mere antagonists.
Because they went to great lengths to avoid depicting the concept of war itself as the villain. The subdued CGI explosions and burning, sinking ships are too tastefully done to get the point across. Carnage is avoided and the PG-13 rating successfully retained. This is no anti-war movie by any stretch; this is good ole' Hollywood war GLORIFICATION.
My own uncle served on U-997. Luckily, he survived the war, unlike almost all his fellow German submariners. The U-Boot-Waffe ""won itself to death"", with a full three quarters of its sailors lost. Most of them were very young. Like almost all soldiers, they felt their country was threatened and they had to do their part. Many found the killing of merchant mariners highly distasteful. They were not monsters. There is no place for monsters aboard submarines of any nation.

He has played iconic roles and is loved by all.I have three issues with Greyhound, and my 5 is a gift because it's a Hanks movie.1. The entire movie was about the captain. And guess who wrote the script?
Tom Hanks wrote the screenplay for Greyhound. I felt his character development of the Captain as wooden, shallow, and confusing. There was no witty or crisp dialogue. It was all about him, his suffering, and the decisions he had to make. Me. Me. Me. Me me me me. Me. Me and me. Sorry Tom, it's like you wrote the movie to glorify yourself in this role.2. It was too short.
The background intro was so meaningless I'm confused why it's even in the movie. He meets a 'girlfriend?' - some short dialogue, and then there are more flashback cutscenes from that meeting used that he actually had talking to her. And when it ended, at just over 80 minutes before intro and end credits, I was left confused as I felt there was a lot more to say about the movie for character development. He also had a good cast to draw upon for storytelling, and this movie had little.3. It was too much, too quick
Sometimes you need to go slow to go fast. I felt the movie went from 0 to Ending in the first 10 minutes - the interactions, action scenes, sequences, dialgue, didn't change much from, Captain has a target, chases target, some interactions with Captain with crew or other ships, target destroyed/escapes, Captain has some dilemma, Captain tries to eat, has sore feet, can't eat cause....Captain has a target, chases target etc etc etc and rinse and repeat.Should you watch this movie? Maybe. If you're REALLY bored. It's not a bad movie - and it felt more like a pilot for a proposed TV series than an actual Hollywood flick. Maybe that's the problem? Instead it wound up as a 91 minute ""We love Tom Hanks"" period drama and it seems narcissistic because he wrote the script as well and the entire movie was about... him. Mr. Hanks.",Greyhound

Well, I am not sure if the technical terms used in this film are accurate...But after browsing through other reviews, it seems that they are indeed very accurate!.The Screenplay by Tom Hanks is very good. Never felt any confusion when a lot of characters report different things to the Officer...That is something that most of the Military films always miss!..The only drawback(Which might seem too much to ask in a 1+1/2 hr film) is that other characters only get a subtle character depth, and their character arc is almost unclear.",Greyhound

585,shamekhjr,"Not The Best, But Worth The Watch",7,10 July 2020,"In an effort to expand its original content, especially in the movies department, Apple TV goes to obtain exclusive streaming rights for Greyhound, a motion picture adapted from C.S Forester's ""The Good Shepherd"", which is directed by Aaron Schneider with the Screenplay done by Tom Hanks. It stars Tom Hanks as Ernest Krause, a U.S Navy commander assigned, for his first mission, to escort a convoy through an area in the Atlantic known as The Black Pit, a known spot where Nazi U-Boats go for ""hunting.With Apple's emphasis on quality in the content they delivered on the platform, as I explained in my review of Defending Jacob (2020), I was expecting to see a masterpiece, especially when there's Tom Hanks in the lead. What we got was ... a little less, but still great.The battle recounted in Greyhound is known today as being one of the longest, most complex, and tactically heavy naval battles in history. Despite the excessive use of navy-specific vocabulary and watching Tom Hanks shouting commands which can be hard to follow especially in tense moments, I still felt the movie tried to simplify things for the viewers especially regarding tactics, which is something we greatly appreciate as viewers. I would like to point out though that it's best if you keep your focus while watching so you don't miss a beat, you wouldn't want to actually.The movie tried to reduce the aforementioned complications through the dialogue, like calling the names of the ships so you know what they are talking about, as well as using text to identify the ships. The cinematography also helped having a clear picture of what is going on and where.Speaking of cinematography, while the plot takes place almost exclusively on the US Navy Destroyer Keeling, they managed to cram some shots of the sea and the convoy that looked aesthetically pleasing but the coloring gives it this unsettling look, that danger is still looming around, all of which help you feel the atmosphere of the characters.Despite all that good stuff, Greyhound is one of those movies where you feel like they could have done a little bit more, which could have made it a lot better. While the movie tried to explore the human aspect of Tom Hanks' character, and there were clear attempts at this, but what was offered was not enough. I am not saying that Tom Hanks wasn't good enough in the movie, not at all. In fact, he still is one of the strong areas of the movie, watching him on screen do his best in trying to portray this historical character, with all the emotional and tactical hardships he endured for 2 days is something not to be taken for granted. However, it was still important for the movie to have a stronger emphasis on the human and emotional aspects. The reason why I think this is important is that adding this human dimension makes the film as a whole more compelling even if the story itself, by design, is not the most action packed, like in Greyhound for example.Another thing I didn't really appreciate about the film is the score. It was generic at best, seemed like the people who made this movie didn't give much attention to it, as they didn't even give it time to shine and really draw you in the plot's general atmosphere. I would say the score/music was this movie's biggest flop.But all in all, Greyhound is one of those war movies that you have to give a watch, even if it's not the best war movie out there, but Tom Hanks' performance and watching how naval battles play out in real life, even in a compressed 90-minute runtime, is still worthwhile. Tom Hanks still keeps an immaculate track record as one of those actors where no movie he's in is bad.The search for the 2020 MOTY is still continuing, but 2020 is shaping up to be a good year despite the pandemic, keeping in mind there's still Nolan's Tenet, Wes Anderson's The French Dispatch, Matthew Vaughn's The King's Man and 007's No Time to Die to still look out for.",Greyhound

Any cat and mouse was generally dine and dusted inside 5 minutes, usually with a dead U-boat.Inserting braindead U-boat commmanders broadsiding destroyers probably didnt help, and so help mr God the amount of wasted ammo fired by apparently untrained naval shipment was not convincing or needed.Tom, we all loved you in Saving Private Ryan, but sadly you could not save the Greyhound from its own basic flaws.",Greyhound

*Depth
*SoundSound
In some areas of the movie, the fear of submarines is captured well. However that feeling is instantly broken by the sci-fi dolphin sound being played at every submarine shot. Submarines are mighty, and normally they are just identified by silence and loud propellers. This sound made the movie look like Pacific Rim 2, more so than Saving Private Ryan, as an example. It simply breaks immersion completely. Without this sound, it would have been a better movie, hands down.Depth
For about 98% of the movie, the camera seems fixed on the captain. We do get small pieces of him being christian, but as far as personality goes, that is about it. We do know he has a lady that apparently didn't want to marry him just yet, and apparently his feet bleeds like none else for some reason. Don't get me wrong, the story is not bad. I would however guess that someone at post production is saving a lot of character parts for another release. All we really got to see was a Captain trying his best to survive. He does seem compitent, but he does fall for a decoy pretty bad. He has his pros, and cons. But there is very little left to the imagination. With the small personal things chucked into the movie, one cannot make an assesment of what kind of man this person is. The crew, we really only remember 3-4 faces due to so many just blending in. For some reason, we have a very incompetent communications repeater who not only freezes at the wrong time, but also seems to be quite unfocused at the task at hand. Any competent sailor would have him replaced instantly.
This feels like Season 8 of game of thrones. There are plotlines, but they were not ventured. Just like we never saw the face of any german submariner, we never got to see any resulting issues from the faulty sonar. This is by far one of the worst naval movies I've seen with this kind of production and this kind of cast. I do love me some naval movies though, hence the pretty allright score.Lenght
The movie seems to end just where the suspense hits the climax. It does not feel like it ended with an ""He overcame his obstacle"" but rather, he won the battle in a just started war. I would have loved to see him train, I would have loved to see the germans talk tactics and I would have loved to see a crossing that did not just scream fiction with the amounts of luck thrown into it. But instead, we get an hotdog without a bun.Great acting, great CGI - But the lack of a longer story with actual content and the overuse of ""Inception horns"" and dolphin sounds sadly puts this at a 6, instead of a 9 contender.",Greyhound

Had me on edge throughout coz of his excellent performance, and same for the rest of the crew. But also the imaging that is no less than impressive, the wide dark seascapes with its rough waters, war vessels and torpedos cutting through it in cold black weather. The constant tension those soldiers are on, trying to make sense of all this and the consequent nervous - but decisively - per second adjusted ordering around, is very feelable/sensible.This - simple&short but highly effective story - movie makes it easy to have yourself sucked into the technical and brutal going-ons of marine battle.There is no time for ""character development"" when you're targeted by nazi Uboat's torpedos while trying to bang those same Uboats out of the sea, believe me........... :-P... are people even enjoying good movies, or just nit-picking and acid-pissing when they get a chance? Deluge yourself into this film and have a good, however nerve wrecking, good ride. There's absolutely nothing ""boring"" about this, really!Prepare for some heavy true-story 1-on-1 battles between German Uboats and the USS Greyhound and other ships in a convoy over the Atlantic during WW2.Production values are high, so also my ranking. Go see it on wide screen, you won't be disappointed even if the first part seems tedious with all the non-stop ordering going on. It builds up to something quite spectacular.

Things to like are the tense pace of action, brilliant acting by Tom Hanks portraying a low key and business only captain who gets the job done without being rash or cocky. As an introvert its nice to see a hero who speaks only as much is expected of him and does not care about rousing speeches or unnecessary conflicts.But the movie lacks to give a view of the enemy or their side of the view. At times it is just an indication to what enemy is doing and we have to imagine the rest.

Hanks as our stoic, resolute, vulnerable, slipper-wearing hero attempts to outwit his German submariner foes. With a smidgen more intelligence this could have been an excellent film, rather than simply an enjoyable and entertaining one. The special effects are excellent and the tension during the almost-constant battle scenes is whipped up efficiently. Unfortunately it's hit in the midships by computer game-level 'good guys v bad guys' scriptIng - especially our screamingly camp German Wolfpack commander - with his comedy ""by zee end of today you vill all be dead"" radio transmissions. Fortunately / unfortunately this is just about all you see of our U-boat crew enemy, leaving the ocean coast clear for our hero captain and his fearless crew.
Special mention to a largely excellent supporting cast, super-realistic ocean-spume CGI and a genuinely affecting burial at sea scene, which is is poignantly interrupted when a corpse fails to be jettisoned smoothly.

No troop ship would ever sail in a convoy. Troop ships were usually passenger liners which could travel at 25-30 knots.

628,goldhook,Realistic Portrayal of the Battle of the North Atlantic,10,4 October 2020,"Tom Hank's portrayal of a first time commander of four escort destroyers, (aka Greyhounds) in1942 guarding a convey of merchant ships destined for England is outstanding. The Merchant Marine conveys are laden with essential supplies needed to keep England from starving, but the fuel, men and munitions to keep them fighting Nazi Germany. If the German submarine wolf packs, can succeed in decimating the conveys, Britain will be forced to surrender. Churchill said winning the battle of The North Atlantic determined the outcome of WWII.The deadliest area was ""The Black Pit"" beyond the range of Allied aircraft. In that area Nazi Admiral sent his U Boats to sink merchant shipping. The Allies developed ASDIC, a rudimentary form of radio not always reliable, but were able to utilize long range radar to detect submarines on the surface. The film graphically presents the limitations of depth charges against the Wolf Packs.One part, though eery in its use, was U Boat commanders talking via radio transmissions to to Tom Hanks, advising they were going to sink his destroyer. The radio transmission ends in a wolf like howl. This is COMPLETE FICTION. U Boats did not possess the radio technology to communicate amongst themselves, let alone to destroyers seeking to kill them. I gave them a pass on this, as it portrayed the violent struggle between the merchant fleet, U Boats, and the protective Shepard's, they Greyhounds.Scene after scene we witness the sinking of merchant ships, and the struggle to save survivors. In the North Atlantic sailors who abandoned their ships could survive no longer than 5 minutes in the frigid water. In one gripping scene Hanks must decide to rescue survivors or return to guarding the convey; now under attack.The stress of the battles are reflected in the actions of the crew. Some cannot repeat the commands, stutter, or sneeze out of fear. Hanks remains awake for 48 hours on coffee. He doesn't eat. His feet swollen and cold from the freezing sea water begin to bleed through his boots. True to the Navy's creed of never leaving the wheelhouse while under attack he maintains stoically and quiet.The final scenes are a tense drama between multiple torpedos fired from different directions at his destroyer from a very savvy U Boat commander.I felt, as an arm chair historian of the Battle of the North Atlantic, it gave a great portrayal of the horrors of that theater. Hanks, and his second in command, Stephen Graham demonstrated the coolness under fire while facing deadly torpedos and U Boat deck guns.The cinematography and graphics were remarkable. The opening scene of the merchant fleet observed by Allied aircraft was stunning.I watched this movie three times, and I felt Hank's portrayal of Captain Krause and Stephen Graham's portrayal of Lt. Commander Cole were in the finest spirit of the US Navy. IMHO both should be Academy Award nominees.",Greyhound
629,Matty57c5,One of the best war movies in recent memory.,8,8 August 2020,"Like most history buffs, I've seen them all. Grew up watching older movies like midway and in harms way with my dad, saw saving private ryan in theaters with my battle of the bulge veteran grandfather and my dads whole side of the family. Greyhound is kind of an anomaly in modern film, it feels like a movie that would have been made in the 60's or 70's. No real love story or other distractions to drag out the story, filmed almost completely on the destroyer with almost the whole run time being action, it's refreshing. This now ranks up on my list of all time favorites, and I think it will stand up for years and multiple rewatches as a timeless battle of the Atlantic story, the closest we'll ever get to experiencing what it must have been like for the early war convoys.",Greyhound

632,gscandurra,Partly Successful,7,4 October 2020,"I must admit I wasn't expecting much out of this movie based on the trailers I had seen. So I tried to keep an open mind and in the end I thought it wasn't too bad but could of been much better.I thought the one area it was successful was how it highlighted how terrifying and desperate it would of been crossing the Atlantic in a convoy at that time. The conditions and odds were not favourable. Certainly prior to say mid 1943 when the balance started to shift towards the Allies. The sense of scale as to how to protect so many vessels with minimum resources was clearly portrayed.The way the movie emphasised the routines on the bridge was a critical part of highlighting the process involved particularly during the sub chasing scenes. The givings of orders and commands and the repeating of those instructions all contributed to the levels of tension and stress. Yes some people would have found this aspect boring but it was more realistic and added to the drama.The CGI wasn't too bad and better than expected to be honest. They are improving this technology all the time and while it still has that grey blue aspect, it was acceptable.The downside of the movie was predominantly the battle scenes with the surfaced U-boats. You could be forgiven thinking they must have been Kamikazes! Also did anyone else notice in almost all the surfaced scenes no one was in the conning towers? How did they know where to go? That was just plain silly.The most annoying let down for me anyway was that the ship was in rough seas, pitching and wallowing, yet inside the ship it was all calm and level. That's a bad and obvious oversight.The outcome of 4 or 5 U-boats sunk was also farfetched, as I stated before, during this period.Overall it was okay. Not as good as The Cruel Sea or Das Boot but a lot better and more realistic than plenty of rubbish that's been dished up to to us in the recent past.",Greyhound
633,sbcbooks,I felt I was watching a computer game,6,10 April 2021,"The special effects in this movie are on par with a computer game - that is, you are always aware you are watching digital graphics and it's somewhat distracting.I can only put it's high rating down to people being desperate for entertainment during the covid lockdowns.",Greyhound

They could have taken the pre-war ""girlfriend"" scene out and added a little more ""destroyer crew life"" and it would have been even better, but I suppose people are critical enough of the lack of backgrounding. Yeah, there was a lot of CGI, but that's the deal with naval movies; without it they're just way too expensive to make. Solid 9 out of 10 from this ship fan!",Greyhound
635,gator-23,"Technically brilliant, but emotionally derelict in duty",6,20 July 2020,"I have a history degree, and an avid consumer of all things naval history, especially WWII naval history. I was looking forward to this movie, and it is undeniably a technical masterpiece.Unfortunately, that is also it's undoing. If you want to know what it LOOKED like serving on a convoy escort destroyer, this is the movie. But if you want to know what it FELT like, this movie is a total miss. The problem is that there is no back story that invests you in the characters. There were opportunities (that would have taken just a few moments) to humanize the characters with even the most basic of back story, from the Captain, to the crew (one in particular), even the German submariners. In the end, they were just one-dimensional flat generic character tropes that did not do justice to the real people that served this terrifying duty. The crew came across more as part of the ship, like equipment, than like real people.Technically, I have a big problem with Tom Hanks casting himself as the commander of a Fletcher class destroyer in 1942. Fletcher DD's were brand-new ships then, and desperately needed in the south Pacific. They were the newest and the best. The average destroyer commander in WWII was a Lieutenant Commander, and was about 33 in age. At 64, Hanks would have to have been a called-up reservist, not regular Navy. I could see him comanding an old 4-stack destroyer or corvette... But no way he would have been given a brand-new Fletcher. So yes, it's his movie, he gets to make the rules. But for a movie whose focus was ultra-realism, this was completely unrealistic to me.And for the reviewer who said it was inaccurate to see African-Americans serving on a destroyer in WWII - that is not correct. African-Americans were serving as mess stewards on US Navy ships for about 20 years at that point. So the depiction in the movie is correct.",Greyhound
636,abilgin,Breathtaking and accuracy verified by the Former Commander,9,25 March 2021,Th excitement and the realistic shots supplied with slight drama is the correct recipe.

So for me the film was spoilt totally, and the German U Boat commander taking on the role of a sub-aquatic Tokyo Rose i found disrespectful to Submarine commanders on both sides - Tom Hanks wrote the script it seems, and this is the epitome of him being so famous that others who read the script did not put him right on facts and history - if only he had watched Das Boot the film could have been so different",Greyhound

644,michgardiner,A chilling game of cat and mouse,8,23 July 2020,"Greyhound is another historic treasure starring Tom Hanks as US Navy Cmdr. Ernest Krause. His task in this latest WWII flick is to assist other allied naval vessels in seeing supply ships safely across the mine and submarine infested waters of the North Atlantic to Europe.Greyhound keeps the tension high by constantly reminding you of the unseen danger that not only surrounds them, but potentially lies ahead as they cross one of the most unforgiving bodies of water on earth at the height of the Second World War. What sets this film apart from most though, is that the lulls in action are as stressful than the bursts of combat they engage in. It's during the brief ceasefires that you realize what they're really up against and it's not just the German subs that literally taunt them from just beneath the surface.Krause's inexperience sees him fall for some of the decoys the Germans deploy, leaving his crew, the supply ships and the other allied escorts even more vulnerable. What starts out as a show of force retaliation becomes a shrewd showdown of wits using nothing more than instinct, skill and bluffing past their weaknesses. And in the midst of all this intensity, Greyhound
perfectly conveys the subtlety and power of what is unspoken in times of battle. It's the silent courage, the refusal to give up, and the modesty demonstrated while facing adversity. This personalization and humanity of the story is what will ensure this film becomes a classic.Overall, a great story about a rarely seen aspect of war that could have only scored higher by showing the perspectives from the other vessels who were a part of the same journey.",Greyhound
645,sensator,Enjoyable from start to finish,8,11 July 2020,"If you are interested in warfare and/or naval tactics then this is a movie for you. I was thoroughly delighted by the accurate lingo used, the mostly realistic employment of weaponry and the overall depiction of the U-boat threat to convoys during WW2.That being said, other than the accuracy of the depiction, there wasn't much more going on in the movie. There is sparse character development and the pacing of the movie gives you minimal time to breathe. Perhaps the pacing is supposed to feel suffocating as per the subject matter. However, I would have liked more time to get to know the crew, and perhaps see some scenes from the German side as well (Das Boot, anyone?)Either way, I hope to see more war movies like this one, I absolutely love historically accurate depictions based on some form of reality.",Greyhound

It revolves around Tom Hanks, so it's vital his character is someone you can connect with. I didn't know if the crew didn't like him, didn't respect him. They seemed emotionless. Did his crew want to serve him?Similarly the script seemed to lack layers and depth. It was essentially the same thing over and over. Why couldn't they have done each attack from a series of angles; those on the bridge, in the air, on the U-boat, below deck, etc.The captains of other ships could have added suspense, with an angle on what Tom Hanks was doing.Sorry Tom, it was not great.",Greyhound

But it seems that the Germans had to be both mean and stupid in this film.
They had to be depicted as evil so they have them taunt the convoy and it's escorts by radio. No sub captain would give his position away like that.On top of that the Germans had top be depicted as stupid too and completely surfaced their Uboots all the time within visual range of the escorts BY DAY when they had perfectly good periscopes. Even in the middle of the convoy, right next to a destroyer at a range of a couple hundred yards. Lunacy, this never happened. Of course when they actually used periscopes they rose up like 10 feet into the air at a range of a maybe a mile from a destroyer.No no no.
When a sub spots a destroyer, he goes silent and goes away, he does NOT attack and surely not head on. Subs did not want to sink destroyers, they saved their precious torpedoes for merchant ships only. When a sub is forced to surface between two destroyers they also don't shoot it out, that's plain suicide.Cowboy action, bubblegum for the brain, nothing more.",Greyhound

The dialogue is very realistic, so many people will not understand, but you will understand what the words or phrases mean because the camera always shows what direction they turn, What the caption commands, ECT. This movie is all on the water except for one 5 minuet scene of Tom hanks (the captain) proposing to a woman before he is sent onto this trip. The SGI is very realistic, and they actually filmed nearly every scene on a ship. There are many scenarios when they quote the book this is based on, also this is very realistic showing many things that went on on older military ships.WARNING ENDING TOLD SCROLL DOWNAt the end the captain (Tom hanks) reaches plane escorts and with about 5 sunken ships and most the subs sunk.",Greyhound

Sadly it didn't quite manage.The film seemed to get technical aspects correct; it felt authentic in its portrayal of life onboard a convoy chasing down the enemy below. That doesn't always make for exciting viewing (we basically have Tom Hanks spending the film barking commands at a crew he either doesn't know or quite trust), however kudos for effort. I did enjoy the battles between surface ships and U-boats but that alone wasn't enough to carry this film.I notice in the credits that the Captain (Tom Hanks) has a surname, but I cant particularly recall - or care - if it was mentioned in the film. There is no character development except hints at his faith and a loved one he has waiting back home. There is not much relationship between himself and his crew, save perhaps his XO, and I felt there was a distinct lack of emotion throughout.I absolutely did not like the U-boat commander mocking the convoy over radio and must confess to laughing out loud when it happened a second time. It didn't quite fit in with the tone and felt like it was artificially creating a villain for the viewer to hate.By no means a classic but a decent, short watch.

I honestly wouldn't have cared about a steaming romance and I am someone who likes good romances.I actually appreciate the navy talk, I love details like that.I can't comment on the German messages from the radio, that seemed a little out there, but I have no clue about that; nor can I comment on the tactical decisions on both sides and whether they are realistic.",Greyhound

It is a onesided storytelling. First and and formost i hate the computer animation, it is so 'Disney-like', second it is obvious that the seaman and military character is not present in the actors, third, never throughout the war did a u-boat surface at those short distances at all, let alone to commence a surfacebattle with a destroyer, and last, it is not raw enough, that's what made 'Das Boot' such a great movie...

It used to be about enhancing a film, not used as a substitute for proper on location filming.The writing is devoid of any story whatsoever. I thought at one point I had wrongly skipped forward 30 minutes because there is no build up or character development.The action is repetitive and difficult to follow.Overall it's akin to a straight to video movie of the 90s, and not befitting of Tom Hank's usual prowess.",Greyhound

700,rodpevoto,"Intense, compressed, brief...",9,11 July 2020,"Having served in the Cold War on both a destroyer and on a submarine, I found this story contrasting the tensions between both worlds. The action is shown from the bridge, CIC, and decks of the Greyhound, which BTW is the slang term for destroyers and those who serve on them. Hanks subtly conveys the ache of leaving a loved one behind and her presence with him during the battle. He and his crew feel the presence of the subs stalking the surface ships and the deaths of sailors both above and below the icy water. There is no perfect rendering of combat in film, but the repeated commands and protocols between naval personnel and vessels are accurate enough to convey a sense of proper urgency to the story. Compressing roughly 48 tense hours into a ~2 hour film doesn't give much time to absorb all that's happening, and that's the point. Training and subsequent reactions shape the story in the faces of the bridge crew as they watch the captain and follow his orders which he does not explain. This is about relationships between combatants, among the ships in the convoy, and between U.S. and British allies. This film, The Enemy Below, and Das Boot make a reasonable trilogy for a weekend marathon. Enjoy this story from either a technical or a relational view as you see fit.",Greyhound

704,scouterrob,The burden and loneliness of command,9,11 July 2020,"A lot of reviewers are bemoaning the lack of character development and claiming the movie is unremarkable and boring. Don't listen to them.This fast paced 88 minute movie is snapshot of a Navy Captain leading his first Atlantic Convoy mission and is a study in the loneliness and burden of command.There is essentially only one character, the Captain. We follow him through 5 critical days where his convoy encountered repeated attacks by German U-Boats, and we see how command weighs upon him, where one wrong decision could cost him the lives of his crew and those of the ships he is escorting.While I have not read The Good Shepherd, the book this movie is based upon, it is my understanding the movie is a faithful adaptation of the author's book, and both Hanks and the Director managed to avoid Hollywooding it and delivering a moralizing agenda.I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie, and my only regret was not being able to see it on the large theatre screen. I seriously hope that when this pandemic is over, Greyhound receives the large screen treatment it was meant to have.My grandmother's brothers served in the Royal Canadian Navy in the Atlantic in World War Two and I now have a greater understanding and appreciation of what their service entailed.This movie is a fitting tribute to all those who fought upon the Seas in the Second World War. It ranks right up there with The Cruel Sea, In Which We Serve, and Das Boot for tense naval war dramas (if you have not seen these movies, go watch them).

This and Das Boot should make good enough companions. The escorts and surface warfare crowd never got their deserved recognition in film - all the glory and movies went to the submarines. I'll allow some of the simplifications, technical mistakes and a bit of drama, I'm supprised they got so much of it right. Das Boot did to naval movies what 2001 did to SciFi, can't expect every naval movie production to go to those lengths.Warning - if you'r not familiar with naval vocabulary some of the dialog will be lost on you. On the other hand if you are a navy-buff you will be pleasantly supprised.So what kind of captain is their left for Tom Hanks to play? I vote for Captain Kirk!",Greyhound
717,steve-65290-97682,Not one to re-watch - like the 'oldies',5,24 July 2020,"I like Tom Hanks. He's definitely one of the more realistic weather beaten believable actors out there. Without him the movie would have sunk like one of the merchant ships the convoys were protecting across the Atlantic.I'm a great fan of classic war films and there are very very few that cut the mustard nowadays when compared to those that were churned out in the fifties/ sixties. In particular : Run Silent Run Deep; The Enemy Below; Sink the Bismarck ; Torpedo Run & countless old British wartime adventures can be watched and re-watched time and again due to their storylines, multiple great character acting performances, intelligent scripts all wrapped up in an overall package that stands the test of time.Greyhound was better than some more recent films in that it didn't bombard you with ridiculous special effects & gung-ho but it just didn't grip you. I like a movie that gets straight into the business without wasted dialogue that makes no sense to man nor beast and I was pleased that Greyhound followed this course but I had no affinity with the characters whatsoever and the fact that it was the Captain's first seafaring trip across the Atlantic as lead convoy protector didn't come across as well as it might have.It's always welcoming to watch something new based on this era and it wasn't bad but.... they just 'don't make them like they used to'.",Greyhound

You know a film is good when it makes you as the audience hate the enemy (germans in this case) as well even though it is not real and your not actually in ww2.

We know he has a love interest and wants to bring her to the East coast before he shoves off to England. We know he is a very religious man, which we see throughout the film. However, the focus of the film is literally a 48 hour timeframe as a US convoy moves over the pit in the Atlantic. This is the area of the Atlantic, where air cover can't go. This, the ships are on their own against German U-boats. The beauty of this film is that it is a detailed look at this specific part of the battle of the Atlantic. In the first 10 minutes the film is already tracking the first enemy sub. Tense, brilliant filmmaking follows. If you liked Band of Brothers and Pacific, the same people made this film.

I think the reason for this was that characters in the book weren't really that exciting to begin with. Unlike Band Of Brothers and The Pacific, this was based on fictional characters from the book. Those two series gave you the time to understand and to bond with those people because they were living out the events they had witnessed in real life. The Good Shepherd doesn't really give you any of that since once again it has fictional characters. It's amazing for what it is but doesn't really deserve the 10 rating due to the fact I expected better and more from the people who brought to life two of the greatest WWII series ever.",Greyhound

As a war film in general, it's still really good. At 90 minutes long, there's no time for a love story, drawn out character development or pandering to today's issues. Only enough time to hit on a few key messages regarding WWII and ship battles.One of them struck me personally. At one point the captain makes a questionable mistake which costs lives. A mistake that any good man would make. Though his actions otherwise cause him to be later applauded a hero, the captain believes he could have done better. A simple message but this film delivers it so subtly and accurately, Hanks nails it.My Grandfather is a WWII veteran, decorated with honors from the US and France. Yet, in the few times he has talked about his part in the war, he tends to focus most on his one mistake and has never talked about any victories for which he is decorated. This is common among war veterans and this movie touches on it perfectly without saying anything and helps me better understand my grandfather.Well worth the tiny price of streaming admission.",Greyhound

747,wlcastleman-77612,"In Greyhound, less is more",9,11 July 2020,"I really liked this movie and admire the care, dedication and restraint that Gary Goetzman, Aaron Schneider and Tom Hanks exercised in bringing it to the screen. Hanks did an overall well-crafted job in writing the screenplay for this adaptation of the 1955 novel ""The Good Shepherd"" by C.S. Forester. Forester wrote tales of naval warfare (e.g., Horatio Hornblower series), and this book is a tall tale of naval warfare since no escort group of 3 destroyers and a corvette ever sank 3 to 4 U-boats during a convoy crossing in the Battle of the Atlantic, especially in early 1942. Hanks' script and acting breathes hope and humanity into the main character, Commander Ernest Krause, who in the book is an officer who is psychologically scarred by both being passed over for promotion in the peacetime Navy (fitted and retained) and by the loss of love manifested in a recent divorce from his younger wife Evelyn. In the movie, Hanks' Krause is still lonely, but has the hope for love and marriage after the war to his girlfriend Evelyn (Elisabeth Shue). The book and movie center on Cmdr Krause's rock-solid commitment to his duty as a Naval officer and command of an escort group protecting a supply and troop ship convoy sailing from the US to Liverpool. He also is unabashedly committed to practicing his foundational Christian beliefs which is shown via his praying openly in front of his men before eating on the bridge and also more privately before going to sleep.
CG played a strongly enhancing role in telling the story of men in ships battling U-boat attacks in the Atlantic. Some recent WW2 battle movies (e.g., Midway) have been CG spectacles with only cursory points of contact to history and the physical world. CG in Greyhound gives the viewer a better perception than possible in books and documentaries of what the Battle of the Atlantic may have been like to those men and women in the convoy.
The one feature of the movie that I found objectionable was the portrayal of the German U-boat commander as immature and tauntingly arrogant in radio messages to Greyhound. German U-boats in 1942 were still crewed by the elite of the German Navy. U-boat officers may have been arrogant based on their early performance between 1939 and 1941. However, they never would have risked giving away their position by broadcasting radio messages in the open. OK....I realize that some artificial device may have been needed for younger audiences to make the Germans enemies seem worth destruction (other than the fact that they were trying to kill you and sink your ships). However, even Cmdr Krause in the book had professional respect and admiration for the German crew manning their 4-inch gun and continuing to fire even though their death in the exchange was assured.
Despite a few perceived flaws, it was a short, action-based movie (91 minutes), based on a short, action-based book, with relatively minimal dialogue and low-key acting. Less is more in telling this story.",Greyhound

The complete story line is brought to you at the start of the movie, by a voice over that takes just a few seconds. The movie is a concatenation of attacks and counter attacks at sea. There is no plot, close to no built up of tension, except for a few seconds left and right.
I see close to no attempt to depict the characters as ""humans with a story"", that viewers can identify with, and you don't get to ""know"" any of the characters during this movie. Conversations are skin deep.
The end is extremely predictable, covered with great symphonies and american flags, and comes across to me as a bit old-fashioned.
The movie is very patriotic, another ""all American hero"". Too bad I could not connect to him.
For those who have been in similar circumstances, off course this will work for you. Not for me though.

Instead, it keeps the focus on Krause and the fantastic performance by Tom Hanks.

I was so appalled at the current 7.1 IMDB rating (as of 8/9/20) that I actually registered for an account simply to warn others who might be fooled into watching this gut-shot deer of a film. I watched it on a 75"" Sony in 4K and felt like I was watching a never-ending cutscene from a bad video game....except there was no ""skip"" option. Speaking of such an option, I would suggest you invoke your option to skip watching this. Hey, I'm no hater, either....far from it. I subscribed to 3 months of Apple TV just to have the opportunity to see this film....and now what to do? There's really nothing else worth watching on there that I can find. Have I mentioned that this movie sucks? Just making sure, because it does. To think, I could've spent the time watching something more entertaining...like paint drying. I seriously don't think there was anything on screen that wasn't CG - save for the actors themselves...if anyone got near actual water it was only to drink it from a bottle. Oh, and speaking of other actors...why even have any? Heck, Tom Hanks essentially micromanaged every last function of the vessel himself! Bah! So unrealistic and disappointing. I'm telling you, watch this on an old CRT TV if you have one, and make sure it has smudges all over the screen or its going to look so fake to the point of being very distracting. This movie made me hate COVID-19 even more. If I give this movie ANY stars at all it'll only be out of respect for Tom Hanks (you've lost your mojo, Tom, I'm terribly sorry) and for the overall effort it took to make the film and for releasing it instead of waiting for the big screen...which may have caused a riot if it had been.

Unlike modern subs that only have to surface for food and supplies, u-boats were more like ships that could submerge when needed. But they were much slower and couldn't stay under for long at all.For sure though, not a lot of character development just an entirely immersive experience. There's some changes to make it a little more accessible (no German caps didn't taunt allied ships, and no seaman would call a screw a propeller-they're just used interchangeably here so viewers know what they're talking about).

It needed to explain who the characters were and their motivations and explain some of the strategy. It was difficult to be anything but a spectator.I imagine the screenplay was pretty simple as 90% of it was techno-babble which made it difficult for me to relate.Having recently watched compelling documentaries on World War II - Netflix: Greatest Events of World War II in Colour - I found it difficult to rate Greyhound higher.

I won't descend into the silly nitpicking of technical errors that occupies so many -- except to say that I spent weeks on end hunting and chasing submarines in WWII-era destroyers and was trained by sailors who survived that battle. Except for some good CG cinematography, this movie was a tremendous disappointment..! One major technical error I can't let pass is the use of a submarine's ""Dive"" alarm for the sound effect of a surface ship's ""General Quarters"" alarm.

782,Eve44,I wish it was significantly longer...,8,11 July 2020,"Honestly, I decided to write a review to counter some of the more trivial reviews found in this thread and to try and present an objective perspective of this film.Firstly, the dialogue in this movie is typical for a movie depicting World War II Naval life and is accurate to the time period. Do not watch this film if you expect anything other than period correct Naval terminology or the constant passing of orders between the captain and the crew, as you are not going to be satisfied with this movie. Ninety percent of the dialogue in this movie relates to the business of conducting asymmetrical naval combat in a high-speed situation and is way too short to have a grand introspective or extrospective expose on the psychology of warfare or one's place in the world. Sadly, the short length of this film prevents any adequate amount of time dedicated to forging interesting and dynamic characters or a complex plot with a villain that was somewhat pointless. If anything, the director should have lengthened the film to expound upon the narrative and bring our cautious, somewhat hesitant, captain to life or pick a handful of critical Sailors to develop a relationship with within 80-minute time constraint.Secondly, there are better movies or shows that depict the Battle of the Atlantic which brings me to my second point. If anything; this film should have been broken into a mini-series, like Das Boot or a full feature series like Band of Brothers or The Pacific. Had the directors decided to embark upon that route, we could have had a significantly stronger plot and been able to identify with the characters in a more empathetic way. As a former United States Navy Sailor, I felt right at home with the style, accuracy, and briskness with which the film endeavored to portray. However, I did not find myself overly attached to any of the featured characters. In fact, the film attempts to ""show"" us that we should feel shocked, saddened, or disheartened by the plight of these Sailors, however, without any in-depth character development, I found it difficult for me to feel any more than somewhat saddened, and by the time that I did experience this emotion, the movie moved onto another chaotic event. Reflecting upon the movie now, maybe that is the point of the plot? Maybe, the film tries to showcase that the chaos of battle does not grant us a moment of emotional expression aside from the adrenaline rush of combat or a life-threatening event. In any case, if you are looking for significant character development, and a grander view of the Battle of the Atlantic at large, this is certainly not the film for you.Lastly, I do not, in any capacity, feel like I wasted an hour and half of my life like some of the other viewers felt. For me, it was a nostalgic trip back into an old life that I long forgotten and I enjoyed every minute of this film despite its shortcomings. Has Tom Hanks done better? Certainly. Did I think he did a poor job with this film? Absolutely not. While my main complaint is that this film could have been significantly longer, I am left with a desire to want to explore more in regards to the treacherous Battle of the Atlantic and the men of all nations who participated.Overall - I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, and while I felt that this film could have been produced as its own mini-series in order to develop the plot and the characters better, I thoroughly enjoyed my time, and I am sure I will return to it again in the future.Enjoy!",Greyhound

785,roguesplintercell,"Beautiful film, but poorly executed.",5,1 November 2021,"I love all movies dealing with the North Atlantic during WWII. This movie is a gripping tale of a fictional ship the U. S. S. Keeling, codenamed Greyhound. It is based on the novel The Good Shepherd by C. S. Forrester, 1955. The story is based on true events of the battles of the North Atlantic during the early years of WWII.Please bare in mind as you read this review that I have not read the book, so therefore I am not aware of the details of the story as put forth by the author of the novel. This review is based entirely on the movie presentation, but I will take a bet that this movie completely misses the mark.Tom Hanks does a remarkable job portraying captain Krause, but I wish he had directed the movie as well as acted the part instead of adapting the screenplay. I think we would have had a much better film overall. But to its credit, I applaud them for including the ""Pillenwerfer"", the submarine decoy used in one of the battles. I have never seen that included in any military film and is a great addition to the battle scene.My biggest complaints are the incessant whining dolphin or whale sounds for the enemy U-Boats. It almost makes the film unwatchable in my opinion. Without that terrible noise, I would have given this movie a 7/10 rating, but as such, I give it 5/10. It's that bad.Second, there are numerous goofs in the film, from a story standpoint as well as factual errors. The first sub that was purported to have been sunk was depicted as sunk by an oil slick on the surface of the water. A common tactic of the German Sub Captains was to fake their sinking by dumping bilge and garbage after a series of depth charges to make it appear that the sub was sunk. Captain Krause's reaction to assume that the sub was sunk was premature and led to the sinking of the other convoy ships.For factual errors, the big one was the night scene at the con, all the lights are red as the should be when doing work at night to prevent to allow peering into the pitch black darkness as well as seeing the controls. But Captain Krause is approached by a crewman who is showing him something on a clipboard and shining a bright white flashlight on the paper. Doing so would have blinded everyone in the room temporarily rendering their night vision useless. The crewman should have used a flashlight with red light instead of white.Another factual error was how many times the U-Boats would surface during the middle of battles and the taunting of the ships, but pulling up along side them. While this might have happened once or twice by a daring sub captain, it was not commonplace and the point of subs was to remain hidden under the water, not to surface randomly for no reason. For a sub captain to surface in the middle of a battle would have required a good reason to do so, such as it was taking on water. Submarines have a snorkel that allows them to remain submerged, but also to take on fresh are and exhaust the noxious air.These factual errors really paint Krause as a lousy captain as he lost 7 ships under the attack of foolhardy Nazi's. Nazi sub captains were some of the best around and would not be so stupid as to surface in the middle of battles. The ocean is their cover and to give that up is just plain dumb. Captain Krause should have been able to pick them off much faster if this had really happened this way. But Captain Krause was a brilliant captain and was quick on the draw. So the error here is in the storyline and directing. They should have consulted more with military historians for accuracy.Overall, this is a great story, but I would not watch it again. It's a one time film, but there are better, more factual films on this topic to watch if accuracy is important. If that is not important, then this film hits its mark for capturing the audience and keeping you on the edge of your seat.",Greyhound

Sure, ""little character development"" is a valid observation, but the point is that the commander of these escorts couldn't allow himself to show his ""character"" (as if his actions under fire didn't show them enough.)

788,andrew-969-252779,The Battle of the Atlantic - from the surface perspective,10,11 July 2020,"No film can or should try to cover all aspects of a complex subject such as the Battle of the Atlantic.That being said, I've been waiting for a film that tells the story of the ""Battle of the Atlantic"" during WW2 from the surface perspective for a long time. Many films of the subject are from the perspective of the German Kriegsmarine U-bootwaffe and there are many very good films on the surface battle, but they are mostly from the '40s and '50s. Few recent films take on the conflict from the side of the Americas, British, Canadians (and later the Soviet) and other allies that endured this unforgiving conflict.The Allied combatants' were mostly reservists, ""wartime duration"" sailors and officers or recalled retired naval personnel, private citizens (Merchant Marines), auxiliaries, and the Coast Guard. Many had to learn on the job often with older outdated ships. These brave souls had to endure the longest battle/campaign of WW2, The Battle of the Atlantic. A battle that lasted 5 years, 8 months, and 5 days (some 68 months). It was a relentless struggle and it played a major part in the survival of England and the USSR and contributed to the final allied victory in Europe.Greyhound takes this on with a nonstop high tension that reflects fighting in the Atlantic in 1942. A time when Wolfpack tactic was taking a terrible toll on the allied convoys. Focusing on the USN Greyhound, a Fletcher-class destroyer (a new state of the art class, that would become the mainstay of the U.S. Navy's Destroyer force) and her Commander, Captain Krause (Tom Hanks), and the convoy (based on convoy HX 25) they are tasked to protect.The main action involves the period of time when the convoy leaves North America's land-based air cover (U-boats were very vulnerable to aircraft that could see them near the surface and attack them). To the point were land-based aircraft could reach them from Europe. For some 50 hours, the convoy was on its own in an area of the mid-Atlantic called ""The Black Pit"" - a fact not lost on Grand Admiral Dönitz and the Kriegsmarine U-bootwaffe - using the gap to concentrate wolfpacks looking for and attacking allied convoys.The film like the C.S. Forester novel ""The Good Shepherd"" on which it's based. focuses mainly on Captain Krause and his relentless struggle to second guess the wolfpack that inability converges on his convoy.Possible Spoiler
We see witness his stress and tension as the hour's pass and the Greyhound encounters one crisis to another. Captain Krause, seems to issue a constant stream of commands to attempt to stay one step ahead of the wolfpack, not always with success. This is what it's like to command when seconds can mean life or death. Often with the 1942 technology failing and leaving Captain Krause to rely on his instincts to glean the correct ""next move"". Tom Hanks and the cast are spot-on.This film has a personal connection for me as my paternal uncle was a Chief Petty Officer (radioman) and spent 9 months in the North Atlantic. A ""lifer"" since before the war, he was mainly on the Murmansk/Archangel run usually assigned to the post of Radioman (and only naval member) on one of the convoys merchant ships, relaying to the ships Captain course changes and commands from the convoy's Commodore. The experience impacted him profoundly, and I do not think he ever truly recovered for it. So I wish to dedicate this review to Chief Petty Officer Phil Hubbell USN, now resting in Arlington.

807,jwyslak,Great action-classic Hanx,10,17 July 2020,Great action movie that pays tribute to the brave souls that participated in the Battle of the Atlantic and are often overlooked. DDay and victory over Germany could not have happened without the deep sacrifices of the merchant marine and their escorts.

S. Forester novel 'The Good Shepherd'. The small sets focused on the commander and command crew of the destroyer really make you feel the action. This film joins 'Das Boot' and 'Master in Commander: The Far Side of the World', among others, of being excellently crafted naval stories.Having read the novel, my only disappointment with the film was that it didn't quite reach the depth of emotion I was expecting from the lead, which I pin on the rather short run time of ~90 minutes.",Greyhound

The film was really good in visuals, I liked the battles, they were very intense and you could feel like you are in that ship with them. But that's it.The movie lacks so much in depth. No characters build up, no history, no knowledge of who they really are, especially the main character by Tom Hanks! It's like they skipped every elements of good story and went straight to the action.
I couldn't feel anything in the entire movie, it was so raw, Tom Hanks only appeard while giving orders and briefly remembering his lover (who appeard in like 2 minutes of the entire movie). No great speeches, no emotions or relations felt between any characters, no near good conversations (the whole dialuge was giving and receiving orders).

For me, this is a great movie, I love seeing small little details in how the captain commands his vessel, and every crewman doing their job, and quick glances to the CiC trying to keep track of enemy vessels. The movie didn't need to show the crewman following the captain around and repeating every word that Sonar/Radar reports, but it does so and adds a very nice detail that I found to be great, and also helped build the stress and tension everyone was under.My only complaint is that the movie could have been longer. I could definately have watched a 3 hour version of this that took it slower in the style of Das Boot.

It's all studio filmed and therefore lacks authenticity of people being on a ship, at sea. It felt too much that I was on set watching the actors as the shots are almost always too close to give wider ""sea"" context. The CGI is PS4 quality. Soundtrack and sound effects are underwhelming.The dialogue is navy technical and sometimes you have no understanding of what they are expressing. 40% of the film is sailors repeating orders. The movie is certainly a golden gem for Navy veterans who understand what it's about.Zero character bond or development. Very difficult to be empathic/care for them. One sided movie with less than 1% German presence in the film.It's 90 minutes wasted, yet it feels like if it was longer, it could have been better developed.This movie is not worthy of being a major theatrical movie nor a premium Apple TV+ movie.

Again it's totally watchable but just lacked a bit of depth.,Greyhound
825,jen447,Grey but exciting.,8,9 August 2020,"Here's a great movie trivia question for you.... which 2020 movies link Claire Duburcq and Elizabeth Shue, and why? The answer is at the end of this review!The battle of the Atlantic, which ran from 1939 to the end of the war, was a key battleground of World War 2. Failure to supply the European battlefront with fresh supplies and troops from the States would spell certain failure. (The wiki page addressing this is here.) But it's a field of combat that has been relatively overlooked at the movies. Of the handful of feature films, the most famous are that famously stiff-upper-lipped British offering ""The Cruel Sea"" from 1953 and Wolfgang Petersen's original 1981 U-boat film, ""Das Boot"", seeing it from the German's side.Here, the subject gets the full Tom Hanks treatment. Not only does he star in the movie, but he also wrote it, based on the C.S. Forester novel ""The Good Shepherd"".We join Captain Krause (Tom Hanks, with a strangely German-sounding name!) on dry land awaiting his beloved Evelyn (Elizabeth Shue) for a proposal. But that's the last dry land we see in the movie, since Krause is captaining the US destroyer ""Greyhound"" on its maiden voyage to protect a convoy of UK and US ships heading for England. But danger lurks beneath the waves as a pack of U-boats attempt to sink as many vessels as possible.The issue with a movie about a war-time transatlantic crossing is that the ships are grey, the sky is grey and the sea is grey. It's a monochromatic and rather depressing context for a movie. To combat that, the CGI used to recreate the action needs to be good, and thankfully the film delivers in that department.Where I had quibbles - and I'm not sure whether this was in Hank's original screenplay or the result of director Aaron Schneider's attempts at ""added flair"" - was in stopping the action mid-scene for a zoom up above the clouds to see the Aurora Borealis. Unnecessary and distracting.Where the film really scores is in the tense action sequences. As a viewer, I found myself straining forwards in my seat for the ""ping"" of the sonar! The cat and mouse games being played out with the hidden foe are certainly well done.... albeit a colleague of mine refuses to watch it because ""torpedoes don't bounce off the sides of ships"" as shown in the trailer!Perhaps what might have made the film richer still would have been the view from the German side. Another star name as the 'heard but never seen' mocking U-boat commander might have turned this into even more of a Shakespearean battle-royale.Overall, this is an enthralling and enjoyable watch that I would recommend. Tom Hanks delivers YET another compelling captain role. It seems to be the rank that he naturally gravitates to.... having the gravitas to command, but not being too far removed from the common man. Here he is supported by the omnipresent Stephen Graham, also equally good.It's a great shame that this never got the wide-screen cinematic release, because Greyhound deserved it. Who knows, perhaps with cinemas spasmodically opening up, there's still time for a national release. That would be good, and I'd certainly go and see it again on the big screen.And, by the way, the answer to my trivia question is this film - Greyhound - and 1917. The reason being that in both movies the actresses named were the sole female players within the whole cast.",Greyhound

So, not a bad choice if you want to immerse into the cold world of ww2 naval warfare for an evening.Anyhow, there are some major flaws I just cant get my head around. The first german sub is sunk quickly and fierce and I realized: yeah, they are picturing how faceless and unforgiving those fights where. But then, later in the film, they keep receiving communications from german sub commanders threatening them in the most ridiculous ways. Thats something to sub skipper would ever do. Who comes up with bs like that? It goes as far as german subs emerging to seek close combat with the destroyers. Against any common tactical principles of submarine warfare and horse sense. In reality, a duel like that would not have lasted a minute, but in Greyhound the destroyers gun crews cant even place a deadly hit for what seems an eternity...Without that, I'd have had the chance to be a great movie.

Perhaps the greatest advantage of this movie is its willingness to forego the industry standard of pandering to the audience. This movie is compressed, and it contains very few attempts to explain itself to its audience. Military terms are used correctly and frequently, and the audience relies on context to understand the scenes. While some may feel this makes the audience work too hard, I felt a sense of relief that the filmmakers respected their viewers enough to preserve a sense of realism. The length of the film is a pleasant departure from the modern ultra-long films. Overall, this is a solid and entertaining movie.",Greyhound
841,dg-74887,Hanks proves yet again why WWII is his specialty,7,1 September 2020,"Another strong and singular performance from Tom. For years Tom has really owned the WWII genre, whether it's his acting in SPR, or producing of Band of Brothers and The Pacific. Tom really understands what WWII means to history and he does an incredible job of identifying stories that people don't know a lot about.Greyhound will give you an overwhelming and emotional appreciation for the NAVY if you did not have it already. Crossing the Atlantic during the early days of WWII was by far one of the most difficult and near impossible feats that the allies undertook.The German U-Boat was by far the most technologically advanced war machine of its day and they terrorized convoys for years killing over 70,000 allied men and women. So when the surviving troops and supplies eventually made it through what was called the Western Approaches and known as Jerry's backyard, it was a very big deal.This movie does a great job of telling the story of the escort destroyers that fought off countless attacks from start to finish. It's gripping, spell binding and will have your heart thumping through your chest for roughly 90 mins.The only thing missing is an actual adversary on the side of the nazis.

polarized love or hate feelings. Many complain of lack of story and character development. I love movies that make you think and I love depth and forethought, especially within characters. From that perspective I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There isn't a lot of story laid out before the action begins and certainly very little character development - but in this case it isn't necessary. Those who love ww2 historu know how dangerous the Atlantic supply chain crossings were, so we can already assume the captain of the Greyhound was hero, why else would we be following his story. And if there was any other lack of assumed bravery, the emotion Tom Hanks conveyed on film was beautifully portrayed. His struggle, his stress, you can sometimes see uncertainty in his face and exhaustion, but his actions never let the crews' faith waiver. And I won't even go into the special effects or cinematography. Unbelievable. Perhaps the
best part of the film. I watched this on a 4K oled with surround sound and it is stunning. I was grateful to have this released direct to video in these depressing times. Give it a shot and enjoy this movie.",Greyhound

It's a shame that since movie makes rely so much on CGI that they can't do a better job of it. It's not like they don't know how. I saw a terrific film about a real coast guard rescue done back in the early 60's and there was no way of telling the bulk of it was CGI. The realism was great ...and I've seen a lot of heavy seas.

Added to this is the amazing musical score by Blake Neeley. It sets the background for the tense story which is based on C.S. Forester's 1955 novel, ""The Good Shepherd."" The film isn't a true story but inspired by actual events.As many know, Hanks is committed to telling the stories from WWII so the sacrifices of the ""greatest generation"" is never lost. This film clearly shows us the heroes of this particular battle. Hanks plays U.S. Navy Commander Ernest Krause who is tasked with escorting a convoy of 37 merchant and supply ships bringing much need supplies to the Allied forces in the United Kingdom. Despite Krause's seniority, this is his first crossing as a Commander.With four destroyers under his command, he must find & defeat the Nazi U-boats (submarines), who are known as wolf packs, over a five-day period without Allied air cover.The cinematography, sound effects, CGI effects and as previously noted, the musical score built up the tension as Nazi submarines battle against Allied destroyers. It's a alarming front row view of the horrors of war and the lives that are lost in the pursuit of freedom.A word must also be said regarding Hank's choice to portray Commander Krause as a practicing Christian. We see him kneeling by his bed, asking the Lord's guidance on Day One, pausing to say a prayer before meals in full sight of several crewmen and his particular devotion to a verse from St. Paul's Letter to the Hebrews, ""Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever,"" which is his reminder that the Lord is always with him.Reviewed by Christine Sal",Greyhound
