0,TheLittleSongbird,Surprisingly entertaining,7,27 March 2010,"While there are some cheesy parts in the script and Shannyn Sossamon while beautiful with a magical smile not quite convincing as the fickle love interest, there is a lot to enjoy. There is constant wit and energy, and the soundtrack is marvellous. The opening scene with We Will Rock You brought the house down when I watched it with my family, and that scene was one of the more exhilarating moments in the film. The dialogue is modern, but there are some flashes of authenticity. One of two of them come across as cheesy but others work surprisingly well. There is a lot going on in the story, sometimes this can be a problem, with the length the film is at nearly two and a quarter hours, my feelings were mixed here. The side story about William's blind father was touching, but for my liking there were too many jousting matches. I will say the acting is very good, with Heath Ledger dashing, Rufus Sewell seedy as the Count and Paul Bettany stealing the show in a wonderfully comic turn as Geoffrey Chaucer. Overall, entertaining and fun, doesn't always work but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",A Knight's Tale
1,SnoopyStyle,Fun with Heath Ledger,8,13 September 2013,"William Thatcher (Heath Ledger) is a young squire with skills for jousting. When the old knight dies, he sets off with Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk). On the road, they encounter a naked Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) who would eventually write ""The Canterbury Tales"". With no actually title, Thatcher fakes his way into tournaments eventually facing the dreaded Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), and woos the maiden Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon).This is a fun movie. It's got action. Heath Ledger is great. Everybody is having fun. The rock music is pumping. It's the simple good triumph over evil/underdog story.",A Knight's Tale
2,Prismark10,We will joust you,6,31 July 2013,"A Knight's Tale is rock n roll medieval romp. It is F for Fun but also F for Fail for any historical accuracy.However it was not designed to be a history lesson but cleverly targeted to a young audience who would lap up a story of Heath Ledger's quest to impersonate a Knight so he can take part in jousting tournaments and take on the dastardly villain played by Rufus Sewell as well as win the hand of a fair maiden.Christopher Cazenove plays Ledger's father in a touching performance.The rock music ups the ante, the costumes, hairstyles and language owe more to recent times.",A Knight's Tale
3,lee_eisenberg,I say: knight Heath Ledger!,10,7 March 2006,"A few years before Heath Ledger starred in ""Brokeback Mountain"", he played a man pretending to be a knight in ""A Knight's Tale"", chock full of deliberate anachronisms (namely the soundtrack). I swear that it was one of the funniest movies that year. I just gotta wonder: who comes up with these things? This movie is also interesting for an early appearance of Paul Bettany, who went on to play Russell Crowe's friends in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", and married Jennifer Connelly. All in all, this is one cool movie. It would be hard to imagine anyone not liking it. Hilarious. So I bid ye all to watch this film...'twill not make ye bored one bit.",A Knight's Tale
4,jboothmillard,A Knight's Tale,8,9 September 2005,"This is a really good medieval story about one man's spirit to be a champion, not just for the money. Heath Ledger plays William Thatcher, he and his two friends Wat (Alan Tudyk) and Roland (Mark Addy) are poor and need money to eat, so William decides to play in a dead knight friend's place in jousting. Then he has the idea to become a proper jousting knight, Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein of Gelderland. To do this he also gets the help of Geoffrey Chaucer (really well cast and show stealing Paul Bettany). Along his journey to being champion William falls in love with Lady Jocelyn (attractive Shannyn Sossamon) and encounters enemy and jousting opponent Count Adhemar of Anjou (Rufus Sewell). There is really good use of rock music in this film, and it hardly seems very medieval. Paul Bettany was number 40 on The 100 Greatest British Actors. Very good!",A Knight's Tale
5,ccthemovieman-1,Jousting With A Modern Take,7,15 July 2006,"A story about jousting but this old knight's tale is anything but old because it mixes in satire of today's modern sports-audience age with some funny bits. Those include the overly dramatic public address announcer (boy, that's even more so since this film came out), rock music blaring out as the contestants do battle, etc.The main characters are nicely varied with distinct personalities. Shannon Sossamon, however, was not quite up to leading-lady status and hasn't had a choice role like this since, either. I would have rather seen her ""assistant"" in this film, or the blacksmith woman, be the lead. Anyway, even though it's a bit long at 132 minutes, it's still entertaining most of the way, with some of the funniest bits at the beginning. However, it's just as much a romance (with Heath Ledger as the male lead) than a comedy.What also is good is the sound and visuals in here: all high-class. The lance hitting an opponent made an interesting sound each time. The surround sound in here was good, too. It's a film most people would like, and I recommend seeing it.",A Knight's Tale
6,Tweekums,A poor boy aims to become a knight,8,11 May 2017,"In fourteenth century Europe having the right ancestry means everything and William Thatcher does not have it. He is the peasant squire to a knight but when his master dies he sees an opportunity. He takes his place in a joust and with the prize money sets about passing as a nobleman. With his friends Roland and Wat he trains then sets off to the next tournament. Along the way they meet the writer Geoffrey Chaucer who helps them by creating a false lineage for a nobleman from an obscure place. William performs well and catches the eye of Jocelyn, a noblewoman, he isn't the only one interested in her though; the brutish Count Adhemar sees her as a prize. Soon Adhemar is sent away to war and William continues to win tournaments; the two things he really wants though are Jocelyn's love and to put Adhemar on his back. When he returns to his home city of London for the World Championships he may get his chance; as well as seeing his father for the first time in years of course if the truth about who he really is were to emerge it would all be over.Anybody expecting gritty realism will be in for a bit of a disappointment; the opening in joust makes it quite clear that this will be a romp the audience cheer on their champions to the accompany of Queen's 'We Will Rock You'; clapping along with the tune! The story might not be too original; there are plenty of films about an underdog working their way up from the bottom to get to the top and get the girl setting the story in the world of medieval jousting is rather different though. The competitions are exciting enough even though there is no real doubt how they will end. There are plenty of laughs to be had along the way; mostly provided by Roland, Wat and Chaucer when we first meet Chaucer he is walking along stark naked as though this is perfectly normal. The cast performed well with Heath Ledger putting in a solid performance as William and Rufus Sewell being suitably dastardly as Adhemar. Paul Bettany is on great form as Chaucer stealing almost every scene he is in. There are also impressive performances from Mark Addy, as Roland; Alan Tudyk, as Wat; Laura Fraser as Kate the Blacksmith; Shannyn Sossamon as Jocelyn and James Purefoy as the Black Prince. Overall I found this to be rather enjoyably; yes it is silly and anachronistic but that is intentional and part of what makes it enjoyable.",A Knight's Tale
7,dbdumonteil,a lackluster parody,5,22 September 2004,"The year 2001 wasn't a good one for American comedies. ""Legally Blonde"" starring Reese Witherspoon was spoiled by a cock and bull story, ""Evolution"" showed an Ivan Reitman who was running out of ideas and with the horrible ""Freddy Got Fingered"", we had touched the bottom. I watched ""A Knight's Tale"" a couple of days ago and it was all grist to my mill. It is supposed to be a parody of medieval movies but I think it is incompatible to combine rock songs with a story that takes place in the Middle-Ages. All right, this feature makes ""A Knight's Tale"" stand out from other medieval action flicks (the first sequence which shows a crowd singing ""we will rock you"" by Queen is the most memorable scene of the movie) but it doesn't mean it is good for all that. There are funny aspects in this unexpected representation of the Middle-Ages: the blacksmith who supports William is actually a woman, Jocelyne declares to William that she didn't read the Bible) but Brian Hegeland conceived a largely predictable story and the presented topics incite to discourage the spectator. I will admit that I quickly myself got bored. At a pinch, this movie enables to appreciate Heath Ledger's fair performance. His ambitious and generous temper, his charm make him an ideal knight. He is ably assisted by a handful of colorful actors with a mention to Paul Bettany who shines in the role of Geoffrey Chaucer. That said, don't expect much for the rest. One last thing: apparently the story takes place in 1356 during the Hundred Years' War, because in one moment the Anjou earl commands troops during the Poitiers battle. Given that Chaucer was born in 1340, he was sixteen years old in 1356. Here, he is presented as a 30 year old character! Brian Hegeland made an unacceptable mistake.",A Knight's Tale
8,Quinoa1984,"At times flawed, but overall it's amusing",7,12 May 2001,"A Knight's Tale started out (and in many parts continued) as a spoof it seemed.  At times I was laughing when I usually shouldn't have been laughing when director Hegeland brings in Queen into the arena.  Maybe though that was a good change of pace for the genre, because in a time of bad films, it's nice to see an amusing action film that isn't too cynical.Ledger plays a guy who serves a knight, until he dies.  Then he takes his place, changes his name to knight-hood, and becomes a champion.  Then the various plot mechanisms kick in and even though the film lays it on a little cornily thick in parts, the overall tone is the key and works.  Best scene- Ledger starts a new dance with David Bowie's Golden Years playing in the background.  B+",A Knight's Tale
9,wes-connors,Heath Ledger Is the Champion / Brian Helgeland Will Rock You,5,16 May 2010,"""Heath Ledger is William Thatcher, a peasant squire who breaks all the rules when he passes himself off as a nobleman and takes the jousting world by storm. The only thing that stands between William and his dream of becoming the World Champion is bad boy Count Adhemar. And when the two rivals go lance to head at the world finals to determine who will be named the ultimate champion, you better arm yourself and hang on tight for the thrill ride of your life!"" according to the DVD sleeve summary.Birthday-suited Paul Bettany (as Geoffrey Chaucer) very obviously steals the show. Richard Greatrex' camera-work is an asset.Filmmaker Brian Helgeland and his regulars do make ""A Knight's Tale"" the ""stylish, exciting, action-packed adventure"" promised. Yet, in what was to be his star-making lead, Mr. Ledger shows little of his later acting depth. As his romantic interest, Shannyn Sossamon is just beautiful - almost enough to make you believe Ledger would risk his life and reputation to prove his love; she's quite demanding. Helgeland's contemporary scripting is amusing, but the soundtrack ""oldies"" and farting ""coda"" drag it down.***** A Knight's Tale (3/8/01) Brian Helgeland ~ Heath Ledger, Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Shannyn Sossamon",A Knight's Tale
10,Theo Robertson,Entertaining But Not Much Else,6,3 April 2002,"A KNIGHT`S TALE is an old fashioned tale about a likeable trio of losers trying to get ahead in life , except it`s set in ye days of olde !. I remember when it was released the trailers featured the scene where everyone dances to David Bowie`s `Golden Years ` which led me to think it`s some silly post modernist musical comedy. Yes it`s a comedy to a certain degree and does features a contempary musical soundtrack but this doesn`t detract from the film and never becomes silly. My only complaints are that it`s maybe a little too old fashioned and the villain Count Adhemar doesn`t do anything evil untill the final reel. All in all entertaining but instantly forgettable. Probably works best - unlike BASIC INSTINCT and BLACK HAWK DOWN - as a first date film.",A Knight's Tale
11,Doylenf,Watching Heath Ledger makes you realize what a fine actor he always was...,6,19 July 2010,"A KNIGHT'S TALE is full of energy right from the start and draws you into the tale with the playfulness of the actors in the central roles--namely, HEATH LEDGER, PAUL BETTANY, MARK ADDY and ALAN TUDYK. It's really a simple tale about a peasant (Ledger) who decides to follow his dream to become a knight in shining armor. Getting there is like watching a two-hour obstacle course when the script has him facing one challenge after another during a series of robust jousting tournaments that must have required great skill from several stunt men.The damsel in distress factor is supplied by SHANNYN SOSSAMON, an exotic looking creature for Heath's love interest, and the villain of the piece is dark-haired RUFUS SEWELL, who would have made a wonderful Sir Guy of Gisbourne in Errol Flynn's ""Robin Hood."" The story is laced with so much jousting that it's almost a welcome relief when the quieter passages of dialog appear between bouts. This is the one drawback of the film--the action sequences are overloaded and extensive, even for admirers of this kind of stunt work.But the acting is beyond reproach, with Heath Ledger obviously enjoying every second of his participation in this good-natured spoof of medieval times, complete with rock music to give it a contemporary edge.Summing up: Entertaining but a bit overlong with too much emphasis on every jousting match.",A Knight's Tale
12,preppy-3,Doesn't work,6,11 May 2001,"By-the-number medieval tale about a peasant (Heath Ledger) posing as a nobleman to be allowed to joust. He falls in love with Jocelyn (Shannyn Sosamon) and has to joust with an evil nobleman (Rufus Sewell) for her. The story has been done MANY times before, so the outcome is never in doubt. The filmmakers decide to add rock music (by Queen, David Bowie etc etc) to certain scenes and, at a dance, have everybody dance modern. It doesn't work. The addition of the rock music wasn't cute, funny or dramatic...just annoying. It reached the point where I wish I could have turned the sound off. The movie is also too long (135 minutes) for such a predictable story...also if contains some of the WORST romantic dialogue I have ever heard. The actors deserve credit for keeping a straight face. However, it's not unwatchable. There are some very nice shots of London (including an absolutely beautiful birds eye view) and Heath Ledger is attractive and pretty good in the lead. Paul Bettany is absolutely wonderful as his helper Chaucer (yes, THAT Chaucer). Sossamon and Sewell aren't as good. It's not entirely their fault--they aren't given much to work with. And will someone cast Sewell as a good guy? He's much too good (and handsome) to always be playing a jerk. So, not a very good movie, but worth a look--on TV.",A Knight's Tale
13,CinemaSerf,Love conquers all....,6,28 March 2020,"Helped along by a cleverly selected soundtrack; the is a fun historical jousting romp with a good cast who are clearly enjoying themselves. Heath Ledger is the squire to an ageing, rather dilapidated knight ""Sir Ector"". When he shakes off his mortal coil; Ledger unlawfully becomes ""Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein"" and embarks on a series of chivalric tournaments alongside his trusty stalwarts ""Roland"" (Mark Addy); Wat (Alan Tudyk) and Paul Bettany as his forger/latter day diarist Geoffrey Chaucer. At one such event he glimpses the beautiful ""Jocelyn"" (Shannyn Sossamon) and is love struck!

14,Calicodreamin,Not bad,6,8 August 2020,"A fun movie with a good blend of humor and serious. The acting is pretty good, and the characters are well cast. The main characters have good chemistry. The storyline is well developed, but it feels a bit one note with the same joust scenes over and over and no side storylines. Could have cut out some unnecessary filler scenes.",A Knight's Tale
15,view_and_review,I Bowed Out,4,23 January 2021,"In this anachronistic movie featuring modern rock music, yet poetic speech we had noble knights, crowned kings, and poor peasants, still the love story was the same. There was a poor hero, a rich/noble bad guy, and the hand of a fair maiden to be won. Much like Robinhood, except with jousting. With time being precious, my interest waning by the minute, and commercial interruptions, I bowed out at the 52-minute mark.",A Knight's Tale
16,neil-476,A hoot from start to finish,8,23 September 2012,"When Sir Ector thoughtlessly dies before competing in a money-making jousting tournament, his squire William takes his place and turns out to be quite good at it. Unfortunately, his lack of noble birth means that he is playing a dangerous game: fortunately, a chance encounter with down-on-his luck Geoffrey Chaucer brings him a penman who can provide well-forged credentials. Accompanied by fellow squires Roland and Wat, William (now known as Sir Ulric) embarks on a career and love life, while making friends and enemies along the way.The minute the audience at the joust start clapping along with We Will Rock You, it becomes clear that A Knight's Tale is minded to cheerfully disregard any suggestion that it should be historically accurate. Indeed, it goes out of its way to pepper itself with anachronistic gags, both verbal and visual.Heath Ledger, doing an excellent English accent, delights as William, and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk provide excellent support as his two fellow squires. Rufus Sewell is a splendid villain, while Shannyn Sossamon is a little anaemic as the love interest. But towering above everything is Paul Bettany's hilarious Geoff Chaucer.This film is hugely entertaining.",A Knight's Tale
17,anaconda-40658,A Tale Told By the Screenwriter.,3,21 May 2015,"A Knight's Tale (2001): Dir: Brian Helgeland / Cast: Heath Ledger, Rufus Sewell, Mark Addy, Paul Bettany, Shannyn Sossamon: Good natured yet light weight comedy set in the early century of knights. Title humorously refers to a knight telling a very large tale. Heath Ledger stars as a civilian who wants to be a knight but he is a nobleman, which apparently complicates things. This doesn't discourage him from training. He makes a name for himself in the tournaments but nobody knows who he is, plus there is another knight whose ambition is to expose him. He wishes to impress the Princess but first he must dispose of another knight whose ambition is, again, to expose him and use her as a trophy. Well directed by Brian Helgeland who previously made the action thriller Payback. with repetitious storytelling and an ending that has no real flair. The knights singing a song by Queen also makes no sense when thinking of the time line. Ledger makes a great impression but he is virtually going in circles in rapid repetition. Rufus Sewell is the stereotypical bully knight with the personality of an empty soup can. Mark Addy and Paul Bettany are also at a loss here playing Ledger's empty headed friends. And Shannyn Sossamon has the thankless role the woman whom Ledger is competing for, as if it matters. Fine production is at best otherwise the biggest tale is told by the screenwriter.

18,HotToastyRag,Make sure you like the modern style,5,30 March 2021,"In high school, one of my English teachers was trying to teach the class a new word: anachronistic. We just didn't understand her lesson, not until she reminded us of the film A Knight's Tale. Then, of course, we all understood. If you like seeing modern touches in a period piece, you'll like the style of this comedy. If hearing ""We Will Rock You"" during a jousting competition annoys you, you don't stand a chance.In this tongue-in-cheek period piece, Heath Ledger stars as a ridiculous cutie pie with blonde curls and a mesmerizing smile. Isn't that the plot? Every girl who went to see it thought that was the point of the movie. I suppose everyone else paid attention to the side plot: a squire who pretends to be a knight so he can enter a jousting competition and win the hand of a fair lady. Naturally, Rufus Sewell is the bad guy, so there's not much suspense at to who Shannyn Sossamon will prefer. But it's very light, so it's not supposed to be suspenseful. Perfect for a matinee weekend when you don't really feel like paying attention to a complicated movie but still want to look at a cute guy.",A Knight's Tale
19,safenoe,Nick Brimble as Sir Ector,7,16 September 2016,"Wow, A Knight's Tale has over 650 user reviews!!! Such is the testimony of this fine movie that is directed by Brian Helgeland, who also wrote the screenplay for Nightmare on Elm Street 4. One standout performance in my humble opinion is Nick Brimble as Sir Ector. I first saw Mr Brimble as the Prime Minister's security head in House of Cards (the original British one) and he has to be one of the most underrated British actors of our generation. His scene in A Knight's Tale where he takes on a young William Thatcher is a masterclass in acting. It needs to be shown to all aspiring actors, now!",A Knight's Tale
20,mm-39,Well ok sort of,7,12 June 2001,"I liked this film the Jousting was great, and who ever did those realistic scenes should get and award.  This film is a pleasant surprise, and the acting is not bad.  The script does not insult the viewer either.  Why did they use classic rock music, its use is out of place, this is not a biker movie, did they listen to AC/DC in midevil times? Why the film makers did this is beyond logic!  Other than that one weak point, the film is time well spent.",A Knight's Tale

The star of the film is Heath Ledger, (Sir William Thatcher) who decides to change his position in life as a peasant squire, so when his master dies he looks towards the world of jousting. Willaim needs a great deal of training and he does practice and fakes himself into a jousting tournament which is only restricted to Knights and royalty and when he begins to win a few matches and is then defeated he seeks other means to gain success. William meets up with a man named Chaucer who is a writer and poet and he decides to have him make up fake documents making him a knight in order to enter into these great tournaments and using another name entirely from a German county. It is not too long before William meets up with a very beautiful woman named Lady Jocelyn, (Shannyn Sossaman) who is royalty and at first they do not get along but eventually they cannot seem to leave each other alone and true love sets into their lives.

23,Rainey-Dawn,Visually Stimulating,9,30 June 2014,"I love this movie!! It is reminiscent of the Arthurian legend in it's own respect and visually captures the medieval time era in an exciting and romanticized way. The movie does justice to the rumors and stories we hear about the legendary tournaments of the knights.The most stimulating parts of the movie are obviously the jousting contests. It is thrilling to watch the men on horseback with their lances battling it out for victory.A good movie for lovers of all things medieval and for those that love to watch dueling battles. Be forewarned, you may find yourself after watching the movie looking for make-shift armor, a make-do lance and a sturdy steed - the movie is that good.9/10",A Knight's Tale
24,KineticSeoul,What movie watching experience is all about,8,27 February 2013,"This is what movie watching experience is all about. When I first saw this movie when it came out, I saw it as a kid and found it alright but not all that entertaining. But seeing it now, I can appreciate this movie more. It has action, romance, friendship, rivalry, honor, virtue, bravery and changing the stars. If you see the movie you will understand what the last bit is about. It isn't the most historically accurate movie but that is not what this movie is about. In fact the director This is Heath Ledger's breakthrough movie. The story is basically about a squire named William Thatcher trying to become a knight and enter the jousting tournament. And not only enter but actually win the big one. He starts out with two friends/partners but makes more along the way. One of them is Geoffrey Chaucer(Paul Bettany) who is this sophisticated and eloquent talker and writer that basically works as an announcer for Thatcher. And one of the most likable character in this movie, Paul Bettany really steals the show. Even if William Thatcher isn't of noble birth he is a knight at heart but just not on paper, which is one of the big conflict in this movie. And also the rivalry from a very superficial, smug and one dimensional antagonist played by Rufus Sewell. Rufus Sewell, he is good at playing very dis-likable character. Jocelyn(Shannyn Sossamon) is Thatcher's love interest, Shannyn Sossamon didn't seem to go anywhere after her role in this. And it's probably because she just doesn't stand out much. Even if she is one of the female leads in this. Heath Ledger is fantastic in this, he just has that likable charm to him. And I couldn't help but root for the guy. Overall this movie has almost all the right elements when it comes to watching movies is all about. If ""Medieval Times"" the live show became a movie and was great. This would be it. Also I think it would have been cool if they left some of the deleted scenes in the movie.8.4/10",A Knight's Tale
25,sddavis63,Interesting Slice Of Life In The Middle Ages,7,3 June 2002,"If you're a fan of jousting, you'll love this movie! Heath Ledger stars as William Thatcher, who is pressed into action in a jousting match after his master dies, and becomes a success. Unfortunately, to enter jousting matches, one has to be able to prove that one is descended from a noble line, and so in comes Geoffrey Chaucer (!) - played by Paul Bettany - who becomes Thatcher's companion, forges his family tree and introduces him before matches to adoring crowds. There's the requisite love story, of course, between Thatcher and Jocelyn, played by Shannyn Sossamon, and the rival for the lady's affections (Adhemar, played by Rufus Sewell,) who must be beaten.It's a very entertaining, fast-paced movie. The images of the middle ages are mostly realistic, although I still don't really understand why the decision was made to have the crowds at the jousting matches acting like 21st century crowds (the wave, etc.) And the modern rock music just didn't fit. Someone must have thought it was cute, but for me it distracted from an otherwise pretty good movie.

But other than that, this movie is an action-packed flick that you can see with your folks on a rainy afternoon. The music of this film will also hold your attention.

28,lesleyharris30,"Has A Talented Cast but a Flawed Plot,",5,12 February 2016,"A Knight's Tale is a mediocre movie with a pretty poor storyline, despite an impressive and talented cast. It certainly has good moments, there are interesting jousting scenes and a great soundtrack, Heath Ledger also delivers a great performance, his characterisation is terrific, it's a pity he wasn't given a better film. The plot is very weak, it lingers on certain plot points, such as William and Jocelyn's relationship, his connection with his friends and long, boring jousting training sequences, it lacks any real depth or heart that you would want from these type of movies, a strong connection between characters. The villain is very weak, he never really feels like a bad guy, we're basically just expected to hate him because he's the lead characters competition, he's not necessarily portrayed as being unlikeable, he's just another jouster, I actually found myself feeling bad for him when the main character and his friends tease him at the end, because we are never given a reason to dislike this guy and to want to see him suffer. It certainly has some redeeming qualities, but A Knight's Tale is lacking in story and character development big time, for Ledger's sake its worth the watch, but certainly do not go out of your way to see it. A young man turns himself in to a knight and aspires to win a jousting competition. Best Performance: Heath Ledger",A Knight's Tale
29,The-Sarkologist,"A rather enjoyable movie, despite the deliberate anachronisms",5,11 February 2014,"I am not really sure about this movie. I must admit that I do like it and it is a lovely fairytale romance, but some of the anachronisms (despite the fact that the director did say that he did them intentionally) to me seem as if they are trying to overlay American culture in 15th century Europe. There a numerous movies where Hollywood pretty much takes an old story (such as The Last Samurai) and adds an American Hero to the movie in effect Anglacising in. A Knights Tale goes one step further by Americansing the tale.A Knight's Tale is very loosely based upon the Chaucer tale from the Cantebury Tales, and I felt that it was a nice touch adding the character of Chaucer to the movie. In fact Chaucer goes beyond being my favourite character to simply being little more than totally awesome. However, notice when Chaucer makes his speeches, he makes them as if he were a contemporary American.What A Knight's Tale is is your typical American sports movie using jousting tournaments instead of the modern sports of Basketball and Baseball. So what we have is the hero starting off in the tournaments to make a name for himself, and then encountering the bad guy who is also a really good jouster. The hero then goes from tournament to tournament until he meets his nemesis in the 'World Championships' (another Americanisation of the sport) in London.However, there is actually a lot of truth in this movie in regards to the sport of Jousting. It was very much a spectator sport (and spectator sports have been around along time – the Romans were very famous for their spectator sports) where only the nobility were allowed to compete. Further, it is true that only the nobility were allowed to participate, and if a peasant were to attempt to participate, then he would be in a lot of trouble (and I would not be surprised if the peasant were killed because back then life was certainly cheap).So, in the end, this is a good movie, and I do enjoy it, but once again, the infusion of American culture into the movie (such as the use of songs from the 70s, for as Hegeland says – it doesn't matter which century you are in, the 70s are always the same, which, as far as I am concerned, is a load of rubbish) rubs me up the wrong way.",A Knight's Tale

31,didi-5,fun flick which passes the time,6,13 January 2009,"'A Knight's Tale' is hardly mind-blowing fare, or particularly well-written, but it is fairly charming, funny, and provided Heath Ledger with another flashy leading part. In this he's OK as the nobody who assumes an aristocratic pedigree to joust with nobles. In support you'll find Mark Addy and Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany, James Purefoy, and Christopher Cazenove, while Shannyn Sossamon is watchable as Ledger's love interest.The film sets its tone from the early scenes, where the audience at a joust clap along to 'We Will Rock You'.

34,FiendishDramaturgy,An odd but satisfying blend,8,15 January 2005,"I was doubtful as to the quality of this endeavor, when it first hit the rags. Rock Music featured along with a medieval tale. Hmm... Frankly, it didn't sound like a good idea, but I attempted to keep an open mind.The first scene where this phenomenon was displayed, I was still doubtful. We Will Rock You is a great song, and one of my favorites from my youth, but it just did not feel right, considering the setting. But still, I attempted to keep an open mind.The cast was found to be above average in way of performance and the quality of energy they gave to the movie. I will have to stop here to add that Paul Bettany's performance alone (even had he been the sole actor in this work) was enough to salvage a botched attempt. He stole the show with a near brilliant performance. The story was a bit over that line of believability, but it was well written and executed well, so I won't fault it for that. There was this small (but fitting) quality of suspense where Ledger and his ""foxy lady"" were concerned, and it added a nice atmosphere to this love story which blended very well with the ""Run"" scene, later. All in all, it was very enjoyable.Some were disappointed, as they expected an action flick, rather than a love story with action elements.But it wasn't good. Not until the ""show us a dance from Gelderland"" scene. When David Bowie starts playing, it sealed the moment and framed it forever in my mind. I was thoroughly sold on this device. Now, true enough, it will fail with other scripts. The work has to be written for the music; centered around the music, without allowing the music itself to interrupt the atmosphere and/or pace of the film. All this, they accomplished. The finished product was a great deal more than the mere sum of its parts, and shows itself to be an enjoyable and entertaining endeavor which played out to a satisfying end.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",A Knight's Tale

When faced with the task of parsing a passage from ""Pardoner's Tale"" into modern English I adopted the trick of paraphrasing Professor Coghill and was awarded top marks accompanied by a cryptic comment in red ink ""Source?""When I tried it again a few weeks later,my Eng Lit teacher wrote ""Enough already!"" on my paper and I dipped the test. He was by no means a stuffy academic and I have the feeling he would have loved ""A Knight's Tale"". The makers have had the front to put Chaucer and two of his creations into a post - modern ironic,surreal non - sequitur comedy that had me laughing out loud at their cheek,gasping at their energy,envying them their youth and revelling in their sense of the ridiculous. It's not a history movie,it's more a Cinema History movie.

37,PWNYCNY,The knight as sports hero.,9,14 June 2015,"This is a wonderful movie. The mixing of 1970s music with a story set in the middle ages works. It is also a clever cinematic device. The story is excellent. The characters are interesting and their interactions interesting and dramatic. Heath Ledger is excellent as the peasant who wants to be a knight. Paul Bethany is the show stealer however. His rendition of Chaucer is the best performance in the movie. The rest of the cast is engaging as well. There are heroes and villains. The movie also dramatizes a martial art that in its day was one of the major sources of public entertainment. The movie suggests that the concept of the sports hero is neither new or unique to present times. In this respect the story has plausibility. For there was a time that games like baseball, football, etc. did not exist. So the concept of sports competition took other forms, in contests that today would be condemned as cruel, but then were considered acceptable. Then again, is two men charging at each other at full speed with lances any different then two groups of men going into each other to gain control of a ball?",A Knight's Tale

Acting is superb and Paul, Alan and Mark has done a tremendous job and off-course late Legder leads the show. Direction is good and screenplay as mentioned earlier predictable yet entertaining.

40,noralee,Jolly Good Fun,8,22 December 2005,"""A Knight's Tale"" is jolly good fun.The rock 'n' roll ambiance, clearly inspired by Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" helps you relate to the goings on more viscerally, so that the jousts come across as big sporting events (via Queen's ""We Will Rock You"") and the ball seems like a prom night (via Bowie's ""Golden Years""). In fact, I would have eschewed the Carter Burwell score altogether and just had a rock 'n' roll soundtrack.The knights' code of chivalry is forgotten as an historical principle (though some pesky wars do intervene) and the jousting events do get a bit repetitive, but the matches are still cheer-worthy.The break-out star is Paul Bettany playing Geoff Chaucer as a spin-meister shill.But writer/director Brian Helgeland (far, far away from his ""L.A. Confidential"" script) must be the only one not to have seen ""Star Wars"" with this ethereal princess love interest played by a vapid super-model type (actually she was a club DJ) rather than someone with more zest. I much preferred the lady blacksmith, but she wasn't given much to do, let alone much of a life, and Rufus Sewall as the villain.Oh and yeah Heath Ledger is easy on the eyes and ears, sigh.(originally written 5/29/2001)",A Knight's Tale

42,triple8,A cute fantasy and worth a night's viewing!,7,1 August 2004,"This is a movie that's so specific in it's plot line it's difficult to see people seeing it unless they really dig knights, sword fighting etc etc. In spite of the fact that those are not things I am heavily into, I did moderately enjoy this cute little fantasy adventure. The two things to remember when watching this are: 1) It's a fantasy-a whimsical story that reminded me a lot of The three musketeers and 2) Some of the rather corny dialogue that appeared to be just thrown in, was, in my opinion probably there on purpose. This wasn't a movie that took itself to seriously. I don't think that the makers made this expecting blockbuster audiences and multiple Oscar nominations, nor should they have. But this movie has a peculiar charm about it, a kind of whimsical escapism that throws you back to the time of ""Lords and ladies"", Knights, sword fighting and glamor! It's a fun movie and certainly worth a night's rental though I doubt I'd have paid to see it in the theater-if I'd even known about it when it came out.The main negatives: MUCH to slow a buildup during the first half hour-after that time passes very quickly but the first 20 minutes at least, really weren't very enjoyable for me and could have been made to flow with the rest of the movie better and: 2)My best friend brought this up and I agree. lady Jocelyn played very prettily and well actually, by Shannon sossoman just didn't come off as a very nice person. It was difficult to like her. My best friend LOVES this movie and had told me about it before we watched a bit and this was one of the observations she had noted and I agree. Although toward the end, I wound up liking her a bit more, she didn't impress me as being a very deep person unlike many of the other colorful characters. Still, Ms. Sossoman is one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen and The Lady Jocelyn brought a Certain color and glamor to the movie that would have been lacking without her so I guess it was alright.POSITIVES: Great-NEVER dull sword fighting-if your not into sword fighting don't worry-they don't get in your face with that-the sword fighting sequences are never long enough to get boring. The surprisingly touching moments-especially when father and son are reunited-yes I did cry at that!!!!The thrilling sequence involving a certain prince and a pardon that absolutely made the movie. Who is the actor who played the prince? He should be a household name.All in all, I would give this a 7.5 and say it's a pretty good, FUN movie-a good summer's rental choice.

There are several scenes where if you squint, you could mistake the movie for ""10 Things I Hate About You"" or some other teen rom com of that time period.Fortunately they found a way to balance the jousting content with personality stories, which are by far more entertaining, but unless you're Kevin Smith, you can't exactly cut jousting out of a movie set in competitions for jousting.This is a fun movie with some positive messaging in it about women and class rights, please give this a go.",A Knight's Tale
45,pc95,Shows Potential But Stumbles,5,9 April 2015,"""A Knights Tale"", directed confusingly by Brian Hedgeland is one of those movies that leaves you disappointed for what it could've been. It's very difficult for a movie to straddle comedy, drama, and action together and this movie ends falling flat trying to do so. Chiefly, what the heck was Hedgeland thinking throwing in anachronistic music cuts haphazardly. They litter the movie like foul garbage stinking up scene after scene, out of place and non- sensical. The cast does their best to bring in some heart and charisma, but the script is a mess, sometimes straight as an arrow, and other times pandering and sitcomish. The costuming, armor, and jousting steps in to remind us of the promise the movie has though, lead actress, apparently new-comer Sharynn Sossaman proves her lack of experience in a flat performance to counterbalance. Then there's Heath Ledger, kinetic and full of energy mostly keeping the movie afloat though his hair is out of control. I wanted to like this movie, but the music single-handedly sunk it for me - you have the credits not even rolling and AC/DC playing!? Common - it's supposed to be medieval, stick to the page or in this case period. 5.5/10 Cannot Recommend due to schizophrenia; needed to stick with one genre.",A Knight's Tale
46,Chase_Witherspoon,The man who would be knight,8,26 July 2012,"I expect to draw howls of disapproval from the peanut gallery for saying this, but in my opinion, this is Ledger's best film in his short inventory. Colourful villains, comic-book characters, action-packed, humorous and sincere, it's a classy film that even at a whopping two-hours and then some, doesn't become laborious or self-important.Ledger plays the dashing, exuberant young commoner who assumes the mantle of the legendary Knight William Thatcher, cutting a swathe through the unsuspecting Mersey with his rag tag trio of companions; Bettany as the as-yet undiscovered lyricist Chaucer, Addy as the rotund loyal Doberman, and Tudyk as the crazy-eyed oddball, brazenly slashing their way across middle ages England, climbing the tournament ladder to its inevitable conclusion with the evil Count (Sewell), whose affections for the tanned maiden Sossamon, provides the catalyst for his showdown with Ledger at the film's much anticipated climax.Christopher Cazaenove has a minor supporting role as Ledger's father, underscoring a talented cast assuredly led by young Ledger, an actor who was destined for greatness but left this film - in my opinion narrowly - as his most entertaining, consistently watchable legacy.",A Knight's Tale
47,brando647,Rockin' Out in the Middle Ages,8,6 February 2010,"Brian Helgeland finds room for all of the usual clichés of your average sports film in his medieval adventure, but yet it still feels fresh, entertaining, and most of all fun. A combination of the perfect cast with an awesome soundtrack keep Helgeland's film from ever feeling too familiar. The film follows William Thatcher, a peasant squire who dreams of one day being able to compete in the jousting tournaments with the knights he's admired all his life. He soon finds an opportunity when he decides to pass himself off as a knight to compete and pursue the woman of his dreams, though he risks penalty of death if his truth is discovered.One of the first aspects of the film you'll notice is the unconventional soundtrack: 1970's rock and roll. Some people are thrown off by the anachronism but I loved it. The film opens with Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" and from that moment, I was hooked. The film is loaded with tracks from David Bowie, Sly & the Family Stone, AC/DC, and more; through the use of classic rock undertones, Helgeland makes the film that much easier for the audience to relate with and feel for. I can't understand how some have complained about the use of modern music in the film, as I thought it amped up the entertainment level and got the blood pumping.What made this film as enjoyable as it was would have to be the cast. This film's stars couldn't have been any better, with Heath Ledger starring as the titular ""knight"", William Thatcher. This movie was my first exposure to Ledger and I thought he was perfect in the role, equal parts noble, courageous and caring. Shannyn Sossamon appears in her first feature film as Jocelyn, the woman who has caught William's eye, and despite a few instances of poor line delivery (could've just been a moment of weak writing) she manages to come across as sincere in her love. I loved the supporting characters more than anything in this film, particularly that of Geoffrey Chaucer. Based on the real English writer/poet and portrayed by Paul Bettany, the character stole every scene he was in with his elaborate crowd-pleasing speeches and his constant bickering with Wat (hilariously played by Alan Tudyk).There is little to dislike about this movie. My only complaint would be that the film slows for a moment when the crew arrives in London for the world championships and William seeks out his father, but it isn't long before the film picks up the pace and rockets along to the conclusion. This movie really is one of the most fun films I've seen and it's broad appeal should interest just about anyone. You can't go wrong with a trip back to the 1370's for a rocking great time.",A Knight's Tale
48,mike48128,Too Much fun to dislike. The film to remember Heath Ledger by.,8,25 September 2015,"Poor Heath. Gone too soon. I would much rather remember him as the high spirited ""William Thatcher"" who impersonates Sir Ector, than as the sick ""Joker"" in Batman. A swashbuckling comedy-drama with jousting being the popular ""sport in fashion"" of the 14th century. I hadn't seen this film in years, and it almost made it into the ""reject pile"" as I am thinning out my Disc Collection. This film should be a ""bomb"" but it is just too much fun. Beautifully photographed in Prague, but with everything wrong: modern songs, inaccurate dress, mannerisms, and dialogue. Tons of very intentional anachronisms. Note both The London Eye and The Eiffel Tower! It's like they are ""daring you"" to find all the ""goofs"" in the movie! Worst-fitting modern song is ""Taking Care of Business"" by BTO, but both ""Queen"" songs (""Rock You"" and ""Champions"") fit nicely, as does David Bowie's ""Golden Years"". ""Chaucer wears only a smile"" and does a ""Rear Monty"" twice. He champions Will's fame and writes his ""Knight's Tale"". Some rough slapstick, but very little gore for a film of this type. (Like Richard Lester's ""Musketeer"" movies). Even the villain (Rufus Sevell as Count Adhemar) is almost likable, until he strips William of his fake Royalty parentage, puts him in stocks, and beats the daylights out of him. Then, Prince Edward ""princes by"" and proclaims him to be ""Sir William"". An impossible ending, as William wins his ""fatal"" jousting match against The Count without his armor and with the heavy lance strapped to his badly damaged arm! Of course he wins ""the Beautiful Princess"", and it all ""goes down"" like a fairy tale. A great Saturday Afternoon popcorn movie, just don't take it too seriously.

Heath Ledger decides he will take his place and with the help of their new friend, Geoffrey Chaucer (brilliantly played by Paul Bettany) they proceed to enter tournaments around the land and begin their quest for riches. Heath Ledger, however falls in love and is driven by different ambitions.With a fantastic soundtrack made better by its placement in a movie such as this one, and a solid set of characters, this movie is an excellent romp of action, romance and comedy.A really surprising movie, definitely not what i expected.8/10",A Knight's Tale
50,sme_no_densetsu,A unique and enjoyable medieval action/adventure movie,7,16 March 2015,"Brian Helgeland's ""A Knight's Tale"" is a medieval adventure story with a twist. Heath Ledger plays a peasant who assumes the identity of a nobleman in order to compete as a jouster. The twist is that anachronistic elements are purposely introduced into the movie in order to give it a flavour not unlike a contemporary sports movie.This approach is perhaps most apparent in the classic rock soundtrack that features well chosen tracks from the likes of Queen, Thin Lizzy & Sly and the Family Stone. The dialogue is also a successful mixture of period and modern English. The costuming also employs an intriguing mixture of old and new styles.The liberties taken with history may rub some viewers the wrong way but I think that they set the movie apart from the many others that are set in the same time-frame. Helgeland's script also incorporates Geoffrey Chaucer as a character, which is a nice touch. I feel that the movie may not capitalize on its unique approach to the fullest extent but the story is generally enjoyable, so it isn't a major problem.Though the movie was mainly a starring vehicle for Heath Ledger the supporting cast was obviously assembled with care. Ledger's band of merry men includes Alan Tudyk, Mark Addy and Paul Bettany, fine actors all. Rufus Sewell is effective as the villain of the piece while James Purefoy makes a welcome appearance as well. Female lead Shannyn Sossamon is a bit of weak link as far as I'm concerned but her maid is pre-""The Artist"" Berenice Bejo.Visually, the movie is attractive, if not especially so. Helgeland's strength lies in writing (as evidenced by his Oscar for ""L.A. Confidential"") but his directorial skills are not to be dismissed. Musically, the movie's soundtrack is nicely chosen while the supporting score is functional without making much of an impression.Overall, ""A Knight's Tale"" proves to be an enjoyable period movie enlivened by some modern touches. The presentation may be more adventurous than the story itself but the movie ably fulfils its function as light entertainment.",A Knight's Tale

53,mstomaso,Absolutely unexpected pleasure. Light-hearted but satisfying on many levels,8,10 July 2005,"This wonderfully uplifting little film has a great big heart, good humor, and a classic message about love and honor, and the rarity and preciousness of those who practice both with style. I went to see this with my spouse and a good friend of ours because THEY (the spouse and the friend) wanted to see it. I am a non-fan of comedies, and had been annoyed by the stream of trashy Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court films that had been coming out since the 1980s. My spouse had also informed me that I would be seeing Jousting performed to Bachman Turner Overdrive. My reaction was to reach for the nearest bottle of hard liquor. I didn't need it.I've now seen this film about six times, and though I can't say that I see something new in it every time (it's just not that complicated), I can say that I have enjoyed it each and every time. The characters, though relatively uncomplicated, are very lovable and the casting is quite excellent all around. Before Brokeback Mountain, William Thatcher was Heath Ledger's most memorable role. He's a poor boy from London's Cheapside who wants to change his stars and to become an honored knight. Travelling from tournament to tournament with his fellow indentured servants, his liege passes on, and William seizes the moment - taking his armor and his horse to become Sir Ulrich Von Liechtenstein of the Gelderland. He is joined by the other now-free indentures, and eventually, by Chaucer and a female Farrier played by the wonderful Laura Fraser. Eventually, William falls in love with a princess and is challenged by a rival for her affections with a lot more experience, money and political clout. The love story, which could have easily become a distracting annoyance, in fact, comes to dominate and drive the story very nicely.Special kudos to Ledger, Alan Tudyk, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany and James Purefoy for their awesome performances. And extra special kudos to Director Brian Helgeland for pulling off an impossible task - taking a fairy tale, making us want to believe it, and yet retaining some wonderful elements of silliness often missing in the fairy tale genre. This would make a wonderful romantic living-room double feature with The Princess Bride.Recommendation: Definitely worth seeing.",A Knight's Tale

(DVD obviously)Lemme tell you... the first hour is practically unwatchable.  Some scene's are so embarrassing I fast forwarded through them.  It's like they used this great music to cover up how bad the movie was.  Unlike Monty Python's Holy Grail... This movie isn't really a parody.  Heck after the credits run... we're led down to a farting contest.  Hey it was funny in Shrek, but these old geezers are utterly offensive.

I'll always remember him as the cool dude in Dark City.In the end, I find the movie odd and overlong.  The actress who plays Jocelyn is gonna go places I'm sure.

55,blott2319-1,Like watching a modern sports film set in medieval times.,9,18 May 2020,"I had heard before watching A Knight's Tale that there were some intentionally anachronistic elements in the story, and they certainly don't waste any time getting to them. The audience at a jousting match participating in ""We Will Rock You"" in one of the first scenes was kind of hilarious. I actually loved all that stuff in the film, because it reinforces the conceit that jousting was the equivalent of a modern-day football game. I still don't know if they did the best job of fully explaining to us the scoring, because I felt a bit lost on how things were working in the later scenes. Thankfully, there always seemed to be a supporting character on the sidelines spelling out what needed to happen in order to produce a victory for our hero. Speaking of that, one of the things I loved most about this film was the delightful characters that filled out the cast. It's much more fun when the film isn't just Heath Ledger vs. Rufus Sewell, but we also get Mark Addy, Paul Bettany, Laura Fraser, and Alan Tudyk injecting some levity and fun into the story.It's hard not to get on board with a good underdog story, and that's what A Knight's Tale delivers. I'm sure the idea of a peasant rising above his station (and even some of the female equality themes) were probably more unlikely than crowds doing the wave in medieval times, but it sure feels good to watch. I thought the romance element worked well also, because it never felt forced, and there was some genuine courting between the two rather than an instant head-over-heels love connection. There were some elements of the story that felt strange as though they were going to be referenced again later. For instance, I always expected William's proficiency as a swordsman was going to come into play at some point, but it was dropped rather quickly and never referenced again. There's something about A Knight's Tale that checked a lot of boxes for me. It has exciting adventure, some good laughs, and a lovely romance. This is the kind of movie that I wish I discovered a long time ago because I would have re-watched it countless times, and it could easily be a favorite. Time to purchase a copy so I can get started on those re-watches now!",A Knight's Tale
56,mattymatt4ever,A surprisingly good time! You will cheer!,7,26 May 2001,"My expectations were very low entering the theater to see ""A Knight's Tale."" But I was drawn in from the lively introduction with a crowd of midieval audience members chanting ""We Will Rock You"" as they get prepared for a jousting match.  Sure, the use of the Queen hit isn't appropriate for the period, but when you hear songs like that and watch scenes like that...do you really care about historical inaccuracies?  There are other head-bopping hits from AC/DC, Kiss, etc. to look forward to.  Just imagine going to Midieval Times, and having some good laughs on the way.  As well as some great jousting action that will you have you cheering, we receive comic relief from the always-entertaining Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk and Paul Bettany as Jeffrey Chaucer, who gives extended intros to each jousting match reminiscent of today's WWF.  This is NOT a movie meant to be taken seriously.  ""A Knight's Tale"" is lighthearted, good-natured fun and the first entertaining movie I've seen in a long while!  You'll have a blast!My score:  7 (out of 10)",A Knight's Tale

When the knight he is a squire for literally drops dead, he stands in for him at a tournament. The ball only rolls faster from there. Heath and his merry men become famous at excelling at tournaments, hopefully they won't be infamous!Laughter, great music and much fun all contained in this movie!",A Knight's Tale
58,Beta_Gallinger,"Doesn't stay consistently entertaining throughout its long run, but overall, a decent medieval comedy adventure",7,21 July 2007,"I didn't see ""A Knight's Tale"" while it was played in theatres, but first saw it on video early in 2002. After my first viewing, it wasn't a movie I was desperate to watch again, but at the time, I probably would have still given it an 8/10. I didn't watch it again until five years later, this time aware of how the film had generally been received (it turned out to be fairly polarizing, in case you didn't know). This time, I don't think it quite did the same for me as it did during my first viewing, but it still left me reasonably satisfied.Set in the Middle Ages, the story begins with the death of a knight during a jousting tournament. The peasant squires of this knight are William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat Falhurst. With their master no longer with them, the three head out on a journey. William hopes to become a jouster, but the problem is that he is not of noble birth, so it is forbidden for him to joust. Despite this, he is still determined. Along the trail, the three meet an author named Geoffrey Chaucer. Chaucer is broke and manages to work out a deal with the squires. They save him from the poor state his life is in, taking him along on their journey, and he forges documents, allowing William to joust under the name Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein. Soon, William finds himself competing in tournaments around Europe, as he attempts to win the hand of Lady Jocelyn, but how long will he be able to keep the truth about himself a secret?!As a comedy, ""A Knight's Tale"" could have been better. The gag at the beginning, with Wat kicking the body of his master repeatedly, hoping he's not really dead, is hilarious, but unfortunately, not too many, if any of the gags that follow can match that one. However, there are other gags which are at least good for a snicker, so I can give the movie SOME credit as a comedy. As an adventure flick, the film doesn't do as well as it could have, either. The movie tends to drag a bit at times, and probably would have been superior had it been made a bit shorter. Some films that are over two hours long are consistently stunning, but ""A Knight's Tale"" is certainly not one of those. Fortunately, it still does have some exciting moments, probably especially towards the end, so it's watchable, in my opinion at least.Some viewers might criticise this movie for its historical inaccuracies. I'm not a history buff, so I really can't point out many inaccuracies, apart from the obvious, such as the crowd singing along to ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen around the beginning, with the film taking place centuries before the song was written. You will hear several rock songs in the film, giving it a modern touch. However, ""A Knight's Tale"" is not a historical drama strictly made to educate viewers on the time. It's a film that was made mainly for entertainment, and as such, it succeeds at a reasonable level. You might even be able to call the movie a spoof (or at least part of it). So, if you want a fully dramatic and accurate film about the Middle Ages, then this is not what you're looking for, but if you want an entertaining adventure film set in the Middle Ages, with some mild laughs here and there, this could be one for you to check out.",A Knight's Tale
59,Stampsfightclub,average 'period' action film,6,15 December 2006,"The narrative:.Many had recommended this movie to me and after the first half I wondered why. The fast moving plot and charming presence of Heath Ledger (10 things I hate about you) as a want to be knight in the middle ages would capture many younger hearts but through the use of an uninspiring plot involving pretty plain characters, cheap jokes and a context not reflecting the time properly failed to grab my vote. Though the story is easy to understand and has a few moments of brilliance it is often a story where not many would honestly care and could predict many of the upcoming events. Many will say it's a bit of fun, innocent fun to be had and yes it is, but its nothing special and for a period drama it doesn't justify itself enough like others have done e.g. Shakespeare in love I was expecting the film, as a period action genre, to reflect the middle ages. There are many references to the sport jostling (too many in my opinion despite it being the central focus) and a few references to nationalism and gender roles, how women weren't in power. Whether I had my expectations too high I'm not sure but regardless whatever the film used and how it tried to convey it never worked and could have been altered into a better more understandable format. I felt Heath Ledger could have performed better. His determination to portray the brave fighter is there but at many points all I saw was the pretty face. Music.I have no idea WHY the producers and other film makers chose to put recent smash hits such as Queen's we will rock you in this movie. Watching peasants in the stand all dance around to this song made me turn away. Why? Is it to present an enjoyment, a celebration of a jostling match? An attempt to present a positive image for audiences so they get a feel of a closely united community? It appeared so but that song in particular would never fit in this would be old styled movie. Settings and Costumes.The costumes are fantastic and a lot of effort was used which made me admire the film in this respect, as did the setting. However it was a shame that the narrative really didn't reflect the time because these features would have meant so much more. watch it if...you enjoy light hearted entertainmentone scene involving the father/son towards the end is deserving of a higher mark than what is given. its a poorly constructed narrative with a few great scenes but the acting and repetitive jokes/action sequences brings down its overall value.",A Knight's Tale
60,Bob-45,Monty Python and the Ten Things I Hate About You,6,14 May 2001,"""A Knight's Tale"" is a witty, wryly amusing fable.  It is also an uneasy blend of melodrama and contemporary farce. ""We Will Rock You"" played over a Mediaeval joust works just find.  ""We Will Rock You"" accompanied by the onscreen players does not.  Inserting modern language in a generally light movie works.  Inserting modern dance does not.  All the elements in ""A Knight's Tale"" would have worked much better had the film remained comic throughout.  Tacking on drama during the final 1 / 3 nearly unhinges it.  The cast is very good.  Special note should be made of Paul Bettany and Alan Tudak.  Heath Ledger is earnest and watchable (as he was in ""Ten Things I Hate About You""  Shannon Sossamon looks much too ""ethnic"" to make a convincing Saxon noble.  Worse, her early line readings are WAY too contemporary (think Geena Davis in ""Cutthroat Island"".)  Nevertheless,she grows with the role, and is both touching and convincing in her dramatic scenes in the last third of the film.  Hey, if Russell Crowe can win an OSCAR playing a Spaniard with an Australian accent, Sossamon deserves to be cut a little slack.Photography, Music, sound, editing and production design are standout. One quibble would be the see-through blouse and hat Sossamon wears early in the film.  The materials look synthetic and the observation by the female blacksmith that ""her breasts are not all that much"" is too accurate to be totally amusing.A fun but forgettable movie.  If you like this sort of thing, you'd be better served by ""Tom Jones"" or ""The Princess Bride"".  Both manage contemporary humor without sacrificing the dramatic impact of their respective stories.",A Knight's Tale
61,Holt344,Great ensemble cast in this funny but superb medieval adventure,8,5 January 2019,"The rock music takes you away from the great atmosphere and immersion but the high standard on the quality in the production, characters, cast, the comedy and the overall writing is just great. The set pieces and props are just stunning to look at, feels authentic and real. The choreography for the sword fights and for the Jousting was well done, catching the slow fighting and incredible stunt work with the horses and the men on the horses. The love story works perfect but it's cheesy, but it's what makes it good as it knows that it is cheesy. I really enjoyed the comedy, how it was written and how the actors played it out.The ensemble cast is filled with recognizable names and they all do great jobs in keeping up with being funny and doing good acting performances. Heath Ledger stands out the most, this being his first as a leading actor and he does the job well. He shines on screen and really goes in deep and makes his portrayal believable.",A Knight's Tale
62,carbuff,"Very lightweight medieval romp--a bit long, but kind of fun.",6,10 May 2015,"First off, this medieval romp is not meant to be either a serious story or history, instead it's just basically a throwback to safe old-time wholesome entertainment, which isn't a bad thing now and again. While it is hardly original, the mix of modern language and pop/rock songs set in the ""wrong"" time period was different and fun and worked well with the story. The story, however, could have used a bit of editing, since two plus hours was a bit more than necessary to tell this story.All-in-all, only a lightweight, predictable and essentially conventional film, but still a reasonable way to kill some time, especially if you have to entertain both children and adults.",A Knight's Tale
63,stamper,A Knight's Fairytale,8,10 December 2001,"This film is one of those surprise movies one stumbles over every once in a while. I mean there are no stars in it that attract much attention, nor is there an abundance of effects or a master of direction behind the camera, to pull in crowds. But anyway this film managed to make more than 100 million dollars in world - wide box office sales. And I must say, deservedly so. It would have deserved to make even more in my opinion (looking at the money inferior movies like America's Sweethearts and Planet of the Apes made this year). I must however also tell you that I saw the trailer and that I was not too excited. I was going to see it, though (not as I eventually did) in the cinema. I was saving it for rental, because I had no money to see it in the cinema. Luckily my stars were changed and a good friend of mine bought me the ticket so we could see this film together.
The film opens with Queen's We will Rock you', a promise the director and the cast are (easily) able to keep. The film is carried mainly by it's great actors and by the script. The direction is standard, no more no less, but the story and the characters Helgeland (also the director) created are more than enough to capture your attention and therefore no elaborate camera work is of need. This film is like a modern fairytale, in which the main character prevails although it seems not to be possible for him to do so.
It is really hard for me to say which of the characters or actors was worst. I simply can't choose and therefore would have to begin with those characters that had no depth (like queen Bérénice Bejo (as Christiana)). But that would not be fair, for not all characters can be equally worked out in a film. All the actors were good, but I have (of course) my favorites. They are really obvious choices, but who cares. The main characters (obviously) were really good. Heath Ledger (as William Thatcher) and Shannyn Sossamon (as Jocelyn) really formed a great on  screen couple. The characters were really believable and I, as the viewer could really appreciate all of their feelings and actions (although they seemed to be rather strange at times). There are but two things I would like to say here (apart from the fact they were great). First of all (and I'm no linguist) I felt at times that Ledger's accent was more Ozzie than British. And second, I fell that the face of Shannyn Sossamon resembles Angelina Jolie's a lot except for the lips (or plastic, just as you prefer to think) of course. Since neither of those facts (the latter one for obvious reasons) were not able to ruin my film experience I'd like to move on. Another pair' of great characters were Paul Bettany (Geoffrey Chaucer) and Mark I will fong you' Addy (Roland). As Heath and Shannyn provided the romance these two provided the laughs. Those two were also really great. Geoff with his verbal low punches' and Roland with his stupid comments and physical high punches. Besides all these who did a great job, I would not like to leave unnamed  Laura Fraser (Kate), Mark Addy (Roland), Alan Tudyk (Wat), Bérénice Bejo (Christiana), James Purefoy (Edward, the Black Prince of Wales) and of course Brian Helgeland for the creation and spreading of this tale.
This is a movie that has no chance of ever getting a sequel though I'm not sure if that is a good or a bad thing. One good thing it did though (besides entertain me and hopefully a lot of other people) was boost the careers of many good actors but most of all Heath Ledger's and Shannyn Sossaman's. I would bet you that Ledger will become quite a star over the following years (or so I hope). I wish all those involved a great and prosperous career, they've deserved it.

He then meets up with a rival knight who is his nemesis throughout the story, and even meets up with the Black Prince and even bests him in a tournament.The story is cliched but entertaining, and though it is supposed to be a parody, with deliberate anachronisms such as playing Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" towards the beginning, the story basically plays itself straight and is not laugh-a-minute, unlike ""Monty Python And The Holy Grail"" which was deliberately silly, as well as gruesome. This movie is much more suited for general audiences.",A Knight's Tale
68,FlickJunkie-2,A cotton candy film,4,8 October 2001,"Everything about `A Knight's Tale' is shamelessly designed to pander the masses.  Writer/director Brian Helgeland, who scored big with `L.A. Confidential' has followed that excellent effort with a succession of progressively worse screenplays (`Conspiracy Theory', `The Postman', `Payback') culminating in this charming but trite puff piece.The pity is that the story had possibilities.  A squire seizes upon the opportune death of his knight to enter a jousting competition and ultimately, albeit illegitimately, establish himself as a top competitor. William/Ulrich (Heath Ledger) begins the film with no skills whatever and with the help of his hapless lads, miraculously is transformed into a lean mean jousting machine.  He is then thunderstruck by the utterly bland Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) and spends the rest of the film trying to win her love.  Meanwhile Kate (Laura Fraser), the only interesting female character, with excellent potential for an intriguing romantic entanglement, is relegated to becoming William's groupie.  Despite good potential for a serious medieval drama, Helgeland decides that it should follow a rutted and unimaginative formula so that it will appeal to all those millions who have loved this same story in different forms countless times before.  As if that isn't enough, he further debases it by filling it with anachronistic contemporary dialogue (`Oh Wow', `Helllllloooo', `Foxy Lady', etc.) and rock music to which all the medieval peasants join in to sing along and boogie.  This wouldn't be so bad if the film was constructed to be a spoof, but after each of these absurd digressions, Helgeland switches back into drama mode, asking us once again to take his characters seriously.Helgeland can't seem to decide whether he wants this to be a farce, a send up, or a serious drama.  It is all out of sync.  The film is funny when it is trying to be serious and dull when it is trying to be funny.  I don't even want to get into how historically unrealistic his depiction of medieval Europe is.  The only redeeming quality of Helgeland's direction is the stunt work on the jousting scenes.  The jousting is brilliantly done and (of course) unabashedly overused.  After a couple of dozen broken lances, it is hard to get up for the final match between William and the evil Count Adhemar as all the spectacle has been wrung out.  It would be like having 25 chariot races in Ben-Hur and asking us to be excited about the 26th race against Messala.Heath Ledger is airy and adorable as William, qualities I know I always associate with medieval knights (sarcasm intended).  Ledger plays the part with such lack of force that it is difficult to believe the rushing wind didn't knock him off his horse long before the opponent's lance hit the mark.  Shannyn Sossamon is pretty, but equally mind-numbing.  Their romance has all the heft of balsa wood and all the maturity of a date to the Junior Prom.Paul Bettany steals what is left of the show with his spirited portrayal of Chaucer.  Bettany provides us with a most remarkable interpretation of the celebrated author, whipping the crowds into frenzy with his commanding introductions.  Rufus Sewell is a passable villain, but comes across more obnoxious than despicable.Overall, this film is so utterly insubstantial and obsequious to the masses that it had to be a hit.  This is another typical Hollywood cotton candy film, sweet with no substance.  It is charming, light, and predicable, giving everyone exactly what they want and expect.  I rated it a 4/10 including a point for the great stunt work.  Serious filmgoers are cautioned to lower their expectations.",A Knight's Tale

The jousting scenes are well-made. The soundtrack with Queen etc. works rather well i think. Of course it doesn't feel very authentic, but this is entertainment and not a history lesson. Mostly what makes it work are the actors. Paul Bettany is fun as Williams herald, and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk are both fun as his friends. The biggest problem with this movie is the running time though. It drags on for what feels like forever. 132 minutes is a long time for a lightweight comedy, and in my opinion it feels like too long.

Hints are everywhere and you will know why Bettany's Chaucer is introduced in the nude, and how Ledger's William came to past, complete with childhood flashbacks. Not to worry, it's all there. Sometimes it feels like ""Lorna Doone"" the recent A&E mini-series. At times, momentarily, the 'jousting' medieval sport and rivalry felt like ""Ben Hur"" or ""Gladiator"".

It was a lark. Loads of dramatic fun. And you can tell writer-director Helgeland loves the word, and casting Bettany certainly did justice and he was never at a lost for it.For those who can take ""Blazing Saddles"" 'energy releasing' jokes without a flinch, be sure to stay until the very last end - yes, after all the credits rolled - there's an out-take scene you might not want to miss.* Laura Fraser was Lavinia, daughter to Anthony Hopkin's Titus Andronicus in Julie Taymor's adaptation of Shakespeare's dark drama ""Titus"" 1999. Hers was quite an impressive performance in spite of being without hands and tongue. She has an easier, breezier role in ""A Knight's Tale.""

Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany and the rest of this amazing cast do a stupendous job. This is a movie that I watch at least once a year, so give it a chance.",A Knight's Tale
79,LivingDog,A Modern Fairy Tale,9,2 March 2003,An unbelievably entertaining movie which has absolutely no root in reality. Breaking all convention the sound track is rock 'n roll music for this midieval story.A boy dreams of changing what is written out before him according to his birth. He grows up as a squire and soon takes on the role of knight - which he has not earned.This movie is utterly totally entertaining. It is pure entertainment - undiluted fun - aka a fairy tale. 9/10Zafoid,A Knight's Tale
80,HelenMary,This film was weighed measured and not found wanting at all,8,4 August 2013,"This film shows without any quibbling just how bright the star of Heath Ledger was. He is luminous in this; beautiful, funny, physical and engaging. He plays excellently against the stunning Shannyn Sossamon, who fits perfectly into the modern medieval setting of this film. Set in the C14th a man of poor birth but sharp intellect rises through the ranks of page-dom with the desire to become a nobleman for food, fame, glory and love.An impressive ensemble cast including the superior Paul Bettany (Chaucer - you can see he had fun with this rather exposing (!) role), Rufus Sewell, Mark Addy, Christopher Cazenove, James Purefoy and Alan Tudyk provides a film that is nigh-on flawless for cinematography that is exciting and gripping, the screenplay - the script - is amazing, laugh out loud funny all the way through. It's one of those films which require certain intelligence to get all the asides and witticisms, or numerous viewings to pick up on all of them, otherwise its still a funny and enjoyable film. With something for everyone this film is a joy to watch again and again, it's also attractive visually - many points to the costumers who mixed historical fashion with a modern edgy almost punk twist. Ditto the soundtrack - mixing in modern music was a clever touch, similar to Romeo and Juliet (Baz Luhrmann), and also an interesting look at fame and the cult of celebrity. A great viewing experience which sometimes even brings a tear to my eye. If you don't enjoy this film, there's something wrong with you. Ignore the haters, it's not supposed to be historically accurate or high-brow! Sometimes a feel-good, comfortable, Disney-esque story arc is just what you want.",A Knight's Tale

Then back in the seventies, some ""X-rated"" adult fairy tales featured contemporary music.  Then ""Love's Labour's Lost"" featured twenties style clothes with Shakespearean dialogue!I can't take it any more!  Now ""Knight's tale"" is playing 80's rock music in the sound track.  If this keeps up, we knit(knight) pickers won't be able to tell a real goof from artistic intent!Despite the rather silly, inane beginning, you do eventually start to care about the characters at the end.P.S.

82,RiffRaffMcKinley,Unconventional is Good,8,18 November 2007,"""A Knight's Tale"" is part historical epic, part comedy, part Cinderella story, part sports flick, and part drama. Oddly enough, it defies convention at all of these films. This is not ""Becket."" Nor is it ""Annie Hall,"" nor ""Cinderella,"" nor ""Rocky,"" nor ""The Godfather."" It is ""A Knight's Tale."" The great cast scores a definite hit with the fantastic story (about the first peasant ever to become a professional jouster) and their own amazing interpretation of it. Brian Helgeland helps them hit, showing his mettle as a top-notch director. And that music? Well, it's the quirk that draws us in. However, ""A Knight's Tale"" doesn't always knock the guy off the horse. It gets far too sentimental, and even too dark at times, and Heath Ledger's performance isn't always as tops as it should be. Since the movie relies on him (mostly) to carry it, this is not a good thing. Nevertheless, this quaint, lovable movie remains a true knight of the order, and will remain so for many years to come.",A Knight's Tale
83,Quicksand,Whole Lotta Fun,9,11 May 2001,"A lot of fun all around.  You can tell writer/director Brian Helgeland was a child of the 1970's, his music tastes are something obviously near and dear to his heart, and they work hilariously during the film, regardless of what your own music tastes might be.  This is what movie scoring is all about.The plot is decent enough, but the characters are wonderful and memorable, and the action is exciting to watch, though there's no telling how it will hold up on repeat viewings.

This movie from the first note of Queen's ""We will rock you""is telling the audience that it is NOT a serious historical account of the Middle Ages. The people that are complaining about inacuracy are missing the point! The movie is fun, not meant to be serious. The performances I believe are adequate to the material. Heath Ledger is fine as William, the rest of the cast seems to be having a ball with their characters. The blending of modern music makes the experience even more entertaining. The tone is good natured, and the story, is yes, a little thin but once it gets going it is involving. In summer movies originality is rare, and at least this movie tries to be a little different. Definitely not a great movie, but it doesn't aim to be. A good time is what it delivers!!! Grade: B+",A Knight's Tale
85,tburke85,A Knights Tale An Entertaining Action Adventure,7,14 June 2009,"A Knight's Tale is an entertaining action adventure. It may not be the best movie ever made but it's still pretty good. Director Brian Helgeland does an admirable job of making this movie about a peasant squire who creates a new identity for himself as a knight after the death of his master. The late Heath Ledger is excellent as William Thatcher the peasant who becomes a knight. Ledger showed in all the films he's been in his talent and this one is no different. R.I.P. Ledger. The rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including Mark Addy, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany, Alan Tudyk, and Shannyn Sossaman. The movie has plenty of action and fights that are well executed with some small does of humor. Also worth mentioning Ledger, Addy, Bettany, and Tudyk had great chemistry together making their friendships believable. They brought much of the comic relief to the movie as well. Ledger also had a good chemistry with Sossman who was impressive as his love interest. Rufus Sewell was a solid villain but he wasn't given much to do except for a few action sequences. The pacing was a little slow at times making it feel a little long. The final confrontation between Ledger and Sewell was fitting it was a bit of a letdown. With it's flaws aside though A Knight's Tale is still a solid adventure with just enough action, humor, a little romance, and exceptional performances by the cast especially Ledger who make this movie worth the time to watch.",A Knight's Tale

87,HenryHextonEsq,A likable film,8,20 September 2001,"This film was certainly refreshing considering it was the first I'd seen since the awful ""The Fast and the Furious"". It both subverts and celebrates the conventions of its genre; romantic medieval action-drama.It's never particularly scathing, or varied in its humour, unlike say ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", but it is often very amusing. Much of the humour is built around anachronistic juxtapositions often involving fashion or music.Importantly, the characters are made likable enough for the sentimental stuff to have some validity. Heath Ledger does give a steady, reasonable performance as the Knight, while the ""sidekicks"" are competent enough. Paul Bettany as ""Geoff"" Chaucher, however, steals the show. The moment when he announced himself - ""Chaucher's the name; writing's the game!"" - was a rather funny in-joke. The temptation to play Chaucher as an utter fool is thankfully avoided, and we are treated to a suitable, amusing take on the poet. Regarding the love interest, I thought it well played.There was some tangible chemistry I'd say, and plenty of twists to the conventions of ""courtly love"", although I suspect some of these date from Chaucher's original Tale. Shannyn Sossamon was rather good I thought, as the lady of some bearing, Jocelyn, aided by a quite dazzling array of costumes... The anachronism of her wearing such revealing clothes at a medieval joust worked rather well. Needless to say, Sossamon is sublimely alluring herself...! I don't really think Laura Fraser's character could have made a better love-interest; Sossamon was just right as the whimsical, fairly modern lady within the trappings of the usual aloof medieval damsel.A particular scene that I liked was the dance, which itself was amusingly absurd, and was backed by incidental music one would find conventional for a medieval dance, which dissolves perfectly into David Bowie's ""Golden Years""...There are few real weaknesses, and I'd tend to be generous towards a film that was so entertaining on the whole. Perhaps it was a little long, with an overabundance of climactic scenes. This was not a film worthy of ""classic"" status, but it was an ample entertainment.",A Knight's Tale
88,Shiva-11,Gladiator without the gore and pathos.,7,9 May 2001,"A Knight's TaleThe term ""period piece"" usually denotes a film that is historically accurate (within reason), often lavish, and more often than not, deals with weighty issues.   Recently this somewhat stodgy genre has been invaded by lighter fare -  ""Shakespeare In Love"" comes to mind - that combines clever writing, with irreverent humor and younger characters, making for broader audience appeal.  Sprinkle in some action, anachronisms, and a retro soundtrack and you should have an entertaining movie.  William Thatcher is determined that he will not spend his life patching fishnets and mending roofs.  After watching a joust, William decides that he wants to fasttrack a career as a knight.   One slight kink stands in his way - only someone of royal blood can become a knight.  William overlooks this piffling detail and sets out to prove himself on the jousting circuit confident that he can find an exception to the rule.  What's a little forgery between friends?I can't review this movie without confessing that I missed the first five minutes of the film due to poor planning on my part - I was at ""The Mummy Returns""* before ""A Knight's Tale"" and TMR ran longer than I had intended. In my own defense, it was not totally my fault - caution weasel clauses ahead - they did have almost twenty minutes of previews before TMR, the movie started late, and ""A Knight's Tale"" started on time.  Okay, now that I feel partially vindicated I can continue.An in-depth knowledge of the feudal system, British history, or the code of chivalry are not prerequisites for enjoying this film, in fact, the less you know, the better.  The film plays fast and loose with everything from the costumes, to the hairstyles to the music (all songs that I enjoyed in my youth - doh!  Just dated myself again) and a tongue in cheek homage to wrestling and brand name advertising.  While Heath Ledger's charisma will surely be enough to draw in the young ladies, he shouldn't be dismissed as a bimboy - he accords his character the right mix of seriousness and flightiness, and does a more than adequate job with his dialogue.  While the supporting cast give passable performances, Paul Bettany steals the spotlight with his take as Geoffrey Chaucer, a melange of poet, gambler, thief, political huckster, and impresario, with barbed one liners, and lightning fast quips.  If only English Lit 201 had been this amusing.Finally, the cinematographers deserve kudos for the exquisite joust shots, combining enough melodrama with the action, to draw the viewers in. ""A Knight's Tale"" is exactly what you expect in a summer movie - entertaining good-looking people pitted against dastardly villains with action sequences sprinkled liberally throughout.   Expect no more and you will enjoy this movie.",A Knight's Tale
89,wnterstar,Entertaining fluff,8,24 July 2004,"OK...I understand this is technically not a great movie...the plot is thin at best, it is predictable, and the anachronisms are laughable.But I also get the feeling that it was supposed to be all those things. The acting is sound, the costumes are breathtaking (even though not historically accurate) and the music moves the story forward as much as any other plot device. Basically, It's a move that is made to laugh at and to have fun with.It's also a movie that understands that it's not enough to want Sir William to win out in the end. It knows you need to see Sir Adamar get destroyed in the end!This remains one of my favorite movies of all time. When I want a feel good movie, this is what I go for!!!",A Knight's Tale
90,vranger,Bears repeated viewings,9,1 April 2009,"Agreeing with some other comments I read, this movie has gradually become one of my favorites over the years. A very few years ago it did a several month stretch on the movie channels when it seemed to be on several times a week. It wasn't unusual during that period for my wife and I to catch it every couple of weeks or so.Many parts are just as funny to me every time I watch it (in many ways like a lot of scenes in Tootsie).The film is very unique in that it consistently breaks with the 'period', yet seems to portray it in a believable way anyhow. I think the reason for this is that the anachronisms serve to involve us in the events in the same way behavior of the time would have drawn those living several hundred years ago ... but we wouldn't fully understand or appreciate those same behaviors now. So the modern behaviors help to involve us in the same way that those of the period might have felt. That sounded convoluted as I wrote it, I hope people get it. LOL The film is also a beautiful piece of cinematography if you see it well presented. This is a movie that I first saw on cable, many times (and before we had HD). I have since bought it twice. Once to see the original widescreen format, and again on Blu-ray.If you are not really stuck up and stiff about the movies you watch, and have a sense of humor AT ALL, you will enjoy this film in at least a lesser measure, and likely a greater measure.",A Knight's Tale

A Knight's Tale provides the purest form of escapism. Watching the film, I was not concerned about historical inconsistencies or implausibility, instead, I was transported to a land where the pride of a knight is the joust.

93,axlrhodes,The most empty passionless contrived film I've seen in a long long time,2,26 May 2008,Probably one of the most boring movie watching experiences I've ever happened right here.This was a badly conceived film that lacked any sparkle and tried to wow you by including modern day music in a medieval setting.The film seems to take forever to end and i had to force myself to stay awake watching it with a friend who for some reason unbeknown-st to me loved it.Im sure Heath Ledgers talents stretch to better limits to what we have here but if his career was to be weighed up with this film he'd have about as big a future as the bloke who played Flash Gordon in 1980 (although that was a great flick).No A Knights Tale is a boring misadventure set against a dull and uninspiring backdrop.It wants to be romantic but it is in no way touching or heartfelt.It wants to be funny but i barely smiled.It wants to be an action flick but I've seen more action in an episode of Coronation Street. To summarise a weak attempt at being different that doesn't pay off and leaves the viewer begging for the credits.I even had the bad fortune to see the extended cut.Films like this should have a boredom warning on the front of the box.

The movie is more of a kiddie to pre-teen flick that is also FAR too long. (132 minutes!) More problems here as the almost all of the characters are unlikeable and annoying, the princess has a ridiculous hairstyle, the acting is wooden, the story is long and dull, and worse yet, the movie soundtrack here feels totally awkward.There is even some silly product placement as a nike stripe is forged on Ledger's armour. Huh? The story gets truly lame as Ledger decides to lose over and over again for the princess. How lame. Why would she ask him to do that?! I think winning over and over again is a better way to prove your worth.One more bad thing, as everyone dances in the hall, they dance to some teeny-bopper crap music. Ick. I thought Ledger should have fallen for the cute blacksmith babe instead. I sure would have.The Last Word: What an awful movie. I fell asleep while watching this and it was still on! Jeez...

95,MichaelMRamey,One Of Heath Ledger's Best,8,27 May 2018,"Dark Knight is obviously my favourite Heath Ledger Film, but I'd easily put A Knight's Tale as my second favourite of his. It has a great cast that has tremendous on screen chemistry. It's a medieval adventure comedy that is thoroughly entertaining throughout. I was hooked into watching this film the first time I saw the scene of the crowd sing We Will Rock You at a jousting tournament way before Queen would ever come into existence. Despite this being billed as a Ledger film and being the lead actor; what really makes this film great is his supporting cast and the connection his team are able to display in only a few hours. This will be looked back on as a true classic.",A Knight's Tale
96,fredericksmith1952,Probably one of the most original movies ever made,10,31 March 2012,"Probably one of the most original movies ever made, this tale compares modern sports to the realm of jousting in medieval times, and pulls it off magnificently. Heath Ledger is perfect in the role of William Thatcher, a young man hired out to a knight as a squire to ""change his stars"". The story has everything, including romance, comedy, and drama. Rufus Sewell as Count Adhemar is the perfect dissociated royalty who cares little for the common folk. He loves the adoration of the crowd and their subservience, and considers them beneath him. Mark Addy, Paul Bettany, Alan Tudyk, and Laura Fraser complete his band of Merry Men and do so with a flair seldom seen in actors who are at the beginning of their careers, but perhaps that is the magic Helgeland was able to conjure here. Personally, I would have reversed the roles of Jocelyn and Christiana, since I think Bérénice Bejo is much hotter than Shannyn Sassamon, but I grant you that is a matter of taste. James Purefoy as Edward the Black Prince plays the role to the hilt, and adds the icing on the cake to this already perfectly baked confection. Toss in perfect photography, excellent costuming, and a soundtrack that evokes all the action of modern day sports, and you have a perfect movie. Rated PG-13 for language, violence, and a brief sexual innuendo, I personally don't see a problem with most preteens watching this. Definitely a collectible film, both for the fans of Heath and the rest of us who just like a good movie.",A Knight's Tale

What I got was something so different and just flat out surprisingly great that I enjoyed every minute, and it completely surpassed my expectations. This actually has a plot, a strong one at that, and though it does not focus on it that much, you know that the film actually has a point and is trying to get it across, if you understand what I mean by that. The acting was great, Heath Ledger does an excellent job as well as Shannyn Sossamon and I enjoyed them when they were both on screen. It certainly entertains from start to finish, though since it jumps right into the main point at the very beginning of the film, and that's not an exaggeration, I got kind of restless and uninterested with it around the ending. Still, you should give this film a chance if you have not seen it. I found it very enjoyable and fun, which surprised me a lot considering what I was originally thinking I would get out of it. It was a very nice action film that I would like to see again.",A Knight's Tale

The cast is pretty talented, the jousting and fight scenes are good and the production design creates a moderately realistic medieval feel.However, I have to level the same criticism at this movie as I did at ""Moulin Rouge"". The use of modern music jerked me out of the period atmosphere and made me wonder what the hell I was watching.Basically, ""A Knight's Tale"" is a pretty predictable ""Boy Meets Girl"" plot set in medieval times, with a jarring modern pop/rock soundtrack. It just doesn't work for me. I was gritting my teeth by the time Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" had finished and only stuck with the film because of the talented cast.

99,kergillian,"Could've been an absolute bomb, but somehow magically works perfectly!",7,30 April 2001,"this film is ridiculously unbelievable, thin on plot, shamefully predictable, historically inaccurate in so many ways...yet it all works! The combination of modern music to medieval setting should be awful, but no, it works! The costumes are totally wrong for the period (on purpose I'd hazard to guess - at one point Angelina Jolie lookalike Shannyn Sossamon is wearing a hat & dress outfit that looks startlingly similar to a costume Julia Roberts wore in Pretty Woman...) but it works! Heath Ledger is an Aussie (what happened to the black hair he had in 10 Things I Hate About You! I didn't recognize him!) and Alan Tudyk is a Texan, so their accents should have tanked! But they didn't, just a few slippages a la Mel Gibson in Braveheart or Jonny Lee Miller in Hackers...This film is funny, fast-paced (certainly didn't *feel* over 2h...), well constructed, hilariously tongue-in-cheek (From the We Will Rock You opening scene to the Nike swooshes on the armor I couldn't stop laughing!) It certainly has its problems (including some *horribly* cheezy lines - most on purpose but that doesn't make them any less horrible! and an evil Hollywood ending - including a Bravheart-like scream of defiance in the final joust that made me cringe...) but those problems are overcome by sharp wit and consistent amusement. The actors were obviously enjoying themselves, and the action was beautifully blended in with the rest of the film. None of the jousting scenes were too long (like, say, the race in Phantom Menace...) and all were shot in such a way as to make them really exciting!And I have to laud Paul Bettany who was an incredible and incredibly amusing Geoffrey Chaucer...even though he looks eerily similar, IMO, to Thom Yorke...)Kudos to anyone who recognizes Laura Fraser (the blacksmith) from Man in the Iron Mask...Overall: A great watch. I went in expecting little and came out extremely satisfied. Not the best film of its kind, but a head above most. And the blending of contemporary style and music and characterization with the medieval story/setting is really well done. It really shouldn't but it does work! 7/10.",A Knight's Tale
100,max von meyerling,A word from Ortega Y Gasset on anachronism,1,21 July 2007,"It would be wrong to suppose that the man of any particular period always looks upon past times as below the level of his own, simply because they are past. It is enough to recall that to the seeming of Jorge Manrique, ""Any time gone by was better."" But this is not the truth either. Not every age has felt itself inferior to any past age, nor have all believed themselves superior to every preceding age. Every historical period displays a different feeling in respect of this strange phenomenon of the vital altitude, and I am surprised that thinkers and historians have never taken note of such an evident and important fact. ... The majority of historical periods did not look upon their own time as superior to preceding ages. On the contrary, the most usual thing has been for men to dream of better times in a vague past, of a fuller existence; of a ""golden age,"" as those taught by Greece and Rome have it...This indicates that such men feel the pulse of their own lives lacking in full vigor, incapable of completely flooding their blood channels. For this reason they looked with respect on the past, on ""classic"" epochs, when existence seemed to them fuller, richer, more perfect and strenuous than the life of their own time.Let it not be forgotten; our time is a time which follows on a period of plenitude. Hence it is that, inevitably, the man living on the other bank, the man of that plenary epoch just past, who sees everything from his own view-point, will suffer from the optical illusion of regarding our age as a fall from plenitude, as a decadent period. But the lifelong student of history, the practiced feeler of the pulse of times, cannot allow himself to be deceived by this system of optics based on imaginary periods of plenitude.... For such a ""plenitude of time"" to exist, it is in that a long-felt desire, dragging its anxious, eager way through centuries, is at last one day satisfied, and in fact these plenary periods are times which are self-satisfied; occasionally, as in the XIXth Century, more than satisfied with themselves. But we are now beginning to realize that these centuries, so self-satisfied, so perfectly rounded-off, are dead within. Genuine vital integrity does not consist in satisfaction, in attainment, in arrival.... When a period has satisfied its desires, its ideal, this means that it desires nothing more; that the wells of desire have been dried up. That is to say, our famous plenitude is in reality a coming to an end. There are centuries which die of self-satisfaction through not knowing how to renew their desires, just as the happy drone dies after the nuptial flight....In the drawing-room gatherings of last century there inevitably arrived a moment when the ladies and their tame poets put this question, one to the other: ""At what period of history would you like to have lived?"" And straightaway each of them, making a bundle of his own personal existence, started off on an imaginary tramp along the roads of history in search of a period into which that existence might most delightfully fit. And the reason was that although feeling itself, because it felt itself, arrived at plenitude, the XIXth Century was still, in actual fact, bound to the past, on whose shoulders it thought it was standing; it saw itself actually as the culmination of that past. Hence it still believed in periods relatively classic- the age of Pericles the Renaissance- during which the values that hold to-day were prepared. This should be enough to cause suspicion of these periods of plenitude; they have their faces turned backwards, their eyes are on the past which they consider fulfilled in themselves. And now, what would be the sincere reply of any representative man of to-day if such a question were put to him? I think there can be no doubt about it; any past time, without exception, would give him the feeling of a restricted space in which he could not breathe. That is to say, the man of to-day feels that his life is more a life than any past one, or, to put it the other way about, the entirety of past time seems small to actual humanity. This intuition as regards present-day existence renders null by its stark clarity any consideration about decadence that is not very cautiously thought out. To start with, our present life feels itself as ampler than all previous lives. How can it regard itself as decadent? Quite the contrary; what has happened is, that through sheer regard of itself as ""more"" life, it has lost all respect, all consideration for the past. Hence for the first time we meet with a period which makes tabula rasa of all classicism, which recognizes in nothing that is past any possible model or standard, and appearing as it does after so many centuries without any break in evolution, yet gives the impression of a commencement, a dawn, an initiation, an infancy. We look backwards and the famous Renaissance reveals itself as a period of narrow provincialism, of futile gestures- why not say the word?- ordinary. What, then, in a word is the ""height of our times""? It is not the fullness of time, and yet it feels itself superior to all times past, and beyond all known fullness. It is not easy to formulate the impression that our epoch has of itself; it believes itself more than all the rest, and at the same time feels that it is a beginning. What expression shall we find for it? Perhaps this one: superior to other times, inferior to itself. Strong, indeed, and at the same time uncertain of its destiny; proud of its strength and at the same time fearing it. The Revolt of the Masses 1930",A Knight's Tale

In fact, I was clapping along with the crowd and singing with it.  It is meant to be participation.  Sing ""We Will Rock You"" with them all. 
The movie is mindless, and I wished that it didn't have its ending.  I wish that it would have just stopped.  But, like all mindless entertainment, it goes overboard with everything.

It was also as Edward pointed out, how he was not a coward, and instead faced probable death with honor, and that his friends did not betray and abandon him. These are rare traits in any man, and as a future King, exactly the kind of person that Edward would want around him. That message (Not shown in films enough these days) is what warrants such a high grade from me.",A Knight's Tale

The world tournament games in London, pop-hair make-up, dancing on bowie's golden years, hahaha. There is not much that should be taken too seriously and because it is so clear this movie does not pretend to be historically correct it simply works well. It is written by someone who probably had a lot of fun doing so. All the actors clearly also have fun with the role they are playing and all together is movie is just fun to watch. It is regularly shown on TV and each time again I start with thinking, no lets not watch it but somehow always end up watching it and each time with fun.It is a movie that will never stand-out or get a real cult following, but it is good for an evening feel-good entertainment.

It dares to mix accurate medieval days with modern-day quirks and literally rock the house down! The flick starts with Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" and the audience beating cadence with their mead mugs, and faces painted like a 21st century soccer match, LOL!The soundtrack is also cool, a great pepper-upper if you're feeling down... David Bowie was used for a medieval dance! Thin Lizzie was used to celebrate Will/Ulrich's early victories...This is the story of a young squire who wished to be a knight from childhood and it all started with the belief of his father that his own dear boy could change his stars and become more than he is... Despite the fact for generations his family were thatchers of roofs - thus their family name! Will Thatcher (ably played by Aussie Heath Ledger) becomes Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein - with the help of a certain stripped Geoffrey Chaucer, more anon, and Will dares to fall in love with the fair Jocelyn much to the disdain of Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell, always a successful villain; e.g. ""God Bless The Child"") who sees Jocelyn as a mere prize to be added with his other trophies! Will soon becomes a champion swordsman, but yearns to be a jouster exemplary as this is where true glory is usually found.With the help of his friends, among them compulsive-gambler Chaucer (Paul ""Wimbledon"" Bettany) who falsified his certification as nobility and Roland (Mark Addy - ""Full Monty"" & TV's ""Still Standing"") his new ""squire"", he tilts at a dummy with a mace, and learns the finery of jousting! Much to his own pain, poor lad...Eventually Adhemar and Will/Ulrich face off, but war against France soon interrupts as Will dares to face Prince Edward, The Black Prince... ""It is not in my nature to withdraw."" Yet Will gives Edward mercy, a fact to save his life later...The course of true love seldom runs smooth, and Jocelyn and Will have their differences but soon overcome them, as Adhemar returns from his missions to learn with loathing that Ulrich/Will has become top dog in his absence...When he seeks the help from some in the crowd as to how to beat Lichtenstein, he hears... ""Beat him? Maybe at night when he's sleeping, with a club, that's the only way!"" Unfortunately he looks to try and literally do this! He follows Will who went looking for his dad to see if he was still alive after all these years, the son of the Thatcher learns his dad is blind in Cheapside eking a living mending fishing nets! He mends his father's roof and Adhemar sees his nemesis engaged in humble activity and seeks to profit from it! Grrr....Will is pilloried and beaten, but he refuses - like the poem ""Invictus"" - to bow and submit, and as his friends ready themselves to battle a bloodthirsty and frenzied mob that loved Ulrich/Will hours beforehand? Up steps The Black Prince who dubs Will as Sir William Thatcher (the importance of showing mercy and granting wishes no matter the consequences) and urges him to engage in final battle with the evil so-called nobleman/chevalier! Adhemar cheats and has a stake covered in spun sugar to look like a metal blunt tip, it shatters and skewers Will... Is this the end? No Way! He faces Adhemar as himself, without armor, as he cries his own name out as a battle-cry and knocks Adhemar off of his horse straight into Kingdom Come! ""You have been weighed, You have been measured, And you've most definitely found wanting! Welcome to the New Worlde, mate... BOOOOOM!"" The film is magnificent and a must for any occasion... whether your boss ticked you off; if Life kicked you in the butt; if you had a real crappy day or even if you wish to impress that fair member that chivalry may be comatose but not dead, m'dear! I hear there'a only one six-star hotel in the world - well, ""Casablanca"" and ""Knight's Tale"" are definitely two 6-star films!!",A Knight's Tale
107,bjones,Oddly Entertaining,8,3 June 2001,"I expected to be disappointed as I had heard enough about this film to know it wasn't a serious period piece, but some sort of parody. Caricatures notwithstanding, I ended up enjoying the film for it's purely entertainment value. Its impudence became a sort of charm of it's own. I began to find myself especially taken with the film's visual quality, it was quite inviting. The set direction and costuming were actually quite good, good enough that this film could have been easily transformed into a very high quality period film without having to result to heavy handed historical accuracy. I guess I'll have to await another day for that to happen. That film is still out there waiting to be made. I found the comparisons to modern day sporting events to be especially humorous. Human behavior has certainly not changed since the middle ages and placing modern versions of such behavior in those more ancient times underscored the nearly absurd plausibility of that.This was a classic tale of good vs evil and he made it seem believable that he could be an underdog. I even found myself rooting for him to the film's inevitably predictable but still entertaining finish (sometimes we all just want to see the good guy win - I still hear women griping about the ending of Braveheart). I think Heath Ledger's future in film is quite secure with hoards of swooning females lining up to see him in whatever. The acting usually gets high praise in entertaining movies and this one certainly had yeoman service from a number of players. Especially on pointe was Rufus Sewell as Count Adhemar. He played his villainy with just the right seriousness and was certainly one of the two brightest points in the film. I thought the main love interest, played by Shannyn Sossamon as Jocelyn, could have been better done by Laura Fraser, who played Kate the Farriess. I thought she was much more enchanting and desirable, but I'm not the casting director. Sossamon overcame this obvious glitch with aplomb, emoting the right responses in all the right places. I did enjoy her though, she made me want to kiss away her tears. However, I saw much more of a spark of talent behind the facade of Kate. I'd love to see more of her in the future. A bit over-the-top, but quite entertaining in his role was Paul Bettany as Geoffery Chaucer, the second standout here. He stole many scenes from everyone, even the action. The highly visible Heath Ledger was the starry-eyed thatcher's son, William, who aspired to glory and a better life. Ledger gave a good enough account of himself with such a heavy load on his shoulders. I enjoyed his portrayal well enough considering I went into it with the preconceived notion that this is a fellow I really shouldn't like, just because the women do. My hat's reluctantly off to Mr. Ledger (but somewhere I would have liked to see that pseudonym in writing. I'm guessing at ""Ulrich von Lichtenstein""), with more chances at bat he seems to have enough talent to someday be as good an actor as any.The parts of the film that helped it overcome the digressions of silliness were the outstanding quality of the production. The sets, costumes and cinematography were quite excellent. Some of the other works directed by Brian Helgeland exhibited the same eye for detail; most notably The Postman and LA Confidential. The costumer's departure from absolute realism fit the theme of the movie, although I'd normally be critical of such lapses. Caroline Harris should be commended for being true to her film. I enjoyed the cinematography so much I looked it up and was not surprised to it was done by Richard Greatrex, who did such a masterful job with Shakespeare in Love. The Art Department, Sound, Editing, Second Unit and Special Effects all made just the right contribution. I'm glad Hollywood can still conceive of doing something for pure entertainment value. All-in-all it was a very pleasant bit of old fashioned entertainment.",A Knight's Tale
108,guyb,The New Standard in Jousting Movies!,8,26 September 2001,"I heard this movie was good, but couldn't really figure out why.  How could someone possibly make a great movie about jousting for 137 minutes?  It was 99 cents day at Albertson's video dept, so I decided to give this a try. What a pleasant surprise!  It had all the ingredients of a great movie: action, acting, romance, intrigue, etc.   I had always been a fan for Rufus Sewell, but this was one of his best performances yet.  Once I was reminded who the director was, it came as no surprise.  Too bad he got his tooth knocked out in rehearsal.   This really succeeded in it's lofty goal of bringing this period of the middle ages to life, much like some of the recent Shakespeare movie like Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet.  In spite of this movie's length, it just flew by and grows on you as it develops the characters and plot.",A Knight's Tale

The movie does well to allow us to see the art of jousting with a modern twist, it was every bit worth the $10.50 I paid for. I loved the cast the only problem I had was with Jocelyn, there was no chemistry between William and her. I really thought that Kate would win his heart, she was just gorgeous and he really seemed to click with her rather than with Jos.

112,TexasRedge,Everthing going for it but.......Until,4,21 April 2002,"this film had everything going for for it, decent acting, good effects, very good story,the costumes are just okay, but this movies suffers from the worst music score in history and a very weak villian. To start out with...I almost didn't watch this film only 5 or 6 minutes into it, I almost lost interest when I heard a medieval crowd sing the 1976 Queen song We Rock you, and the background music only got worst from there, as if Queen songs weren't bad enough the Producer(or Director)electing to go with screeching heavy metal guitars solos(played by Yngwie Malmsteen) as background music during the Jousting scenes. and during one chase scene the background music was  Thin Lizzy singing ""The Boys are in Town"" - I have nothing against these songs- Infact I like Queen,Thin Lizzy and Yngwie Malmsteen, the problem for me is the I felt like a film of this magnatude should have had a bold orchestrial music score. My second gripe about this film is that the Bad Guy(villian) isn't very strong,I would have liked to have seen a much stronger villian. Other than being a smart allick with a bad attitude,the writers of this film never give you a real reason to root against him(other than the fact that he rats out the lead charactor for not being of Noble birth). Another thing I disliked was the idea of a world championships of jousting(thus such things never existed in real medieval times - although tournaments were common) I would have liked  to seen the World Championships written out in favor of a higher paying tournament(I felt there was ways of convaying the same message in a different way)- I blame the director because this film had so much potential only to ruin it with  heavy metal Rock'n'roll music, a villian that you have no reason to dislike, and a fony concept of a world championships as if it were like modern day tennis. I give this film 2 out of 5 stars - a watch it one time and forget it movie",A Knight's Tale
113,Gambitt,"stupid, but not too bad",6,27 May 2001,"Yes, this movie is as dumb as they said it would be.However, I give it credit for knowing that it is a corny teen, cheese flick set in a fictitious medieval time, and not trying to be more than that.The movie starts out with Queen's ""We Will Rock You.""  It would've been cheesey enough, except that the characters are actually singing, stomping, clapping to the lyrics; it becomes super, ultra cheesey and stupid instead.However, this beginning is actually a good thing.  The corny music forces the audience to release any historical or intellectual preconceptions, and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  Right from the start, you know this will be light-hearted and brainless.The action scenes will draw you in.  The plot is predictable and corny.  The set is done nicely in some respects, yet the directors couldn't resist adding ridiculous 21st century cues here and there.Most of the characters wear pseudo-medieval costumes, but the exceptions are pretty extreme.  The Prince wears this post-Matrix, Neo trench coat thing. Jocelyn's entire wardrobe looks like it came from... Macy's.

115,andrewmerritt-31652,A parody of Shakespeare and a sport movie as well,8,18 January 2019,"A Knight's Tale stars Heath Ledger as William Thatcher who decides to pursue the idea of becoming a knight after his master dies in a jousting tournament. A Knight's Tale is also set during the medieval era and unlike most medieval ear movies, it's really unique and quirky. If I could describe A Knight's Tale it's like a parody of Shakespeare meets a parody of sports movies, but with a twist as it gives it a modernized remix to the classic Shakespeare. As with most medieval movies the music is very elegant and graceful, but in A Knight's Tale they remove that and instead add in music like AC/DC, Queen, and every classic rock n' roll song you can think of. And while some people might think that this is an idiotic and stupid concept, I think it is genius. In most Shakespeare movies the language is very colorful and imaginative, but here in A Knight's Tale they still keep that Shakespeare language, but instead give it a modern twist so they can let the audience know that nobody talks like that anymore and it makes us feel stupid at the same time. And that's what I liked about it. I'm not a big Shakespeare fan as I have no idea what they are talking about and it gets confusing so this movie knows my pain and it understands me. This can also be seen as a sports movie just like Die Hard is a Christmas movie. In sports movies we usually have a protagonist or protagonists who are nobody's, and eventually become somebody's. And a Knight's Tale does follow the same rules as most sports movies do, but instead of boxing or football, the theme of this is jousting. And jousting was a sport back then, so it technically counts as a sports movie. But instead of making jousting into a grim and dark movie, the creators instead give us a fun and entertaining version of jousting almost like it's a parody of sports movies. And what all this comes down to is a modern person trapped in a Shakespeare body, who still talks and acts like Shakespeare, but from a completely different universe. So in the end A Knights Tale is an entertaining movie with an update to the classic Shakespeare language that doesn't take itself too seriously, but will probably not work for the die hard fans of Shakespeare.",A Knight's Tale
116,Caz1964,Average romp,6,8 October 2006,"Rather odd story set in the middle ages,which tells the story of a peasant who pretends to be a noble man,so that he can become a knight and win tournament's and then win the hand of a princess.It started off fairly amusing and i thought it was going to be a really entertaining film,but instead it just became more and more predictable and boring.The modern music such as 'We Will Rock You'and' Golden Years' just seemed out of place for me no matter how much i tried to stretch my imagination.But the worst parts in this film for me was the over sentimentality,like when Heath Ledger finds his father again but he has become blind,and where he sees one of his ex- components and he turns out to be a prince called Edward, this is what i call corn.The film would have been much better if it had just stuck to being a scatter-brained comedy without the sentimental parts,which really made me lose interest and it didn't need to be two and a half hours long.Otherwise the film does have its funny moments and because it doesn't try to be a history lesson and doesn't take it self seriously its worth watching if its only once.Although i find it totally forgettable.",A Knight's Tale
117,Mccadoo,This movie is a under-appreciated jem,9,8 October 2007,"I never saw A Knights Tale in the theater. The preview for it I saw on television showed the crowd at the first joust singing and dancing to a Queen song and, as a student of medieval history I found that silly and so passed on the movie. Apparently so did a lot of other people.Well I was wrong. Since then I've watched this movie several times on DVD, alone and with friends/family that I've introduced to it, and who've all loved it too. It's true that A Knights Tale will never win any kudos for historical accuracy but so what, it wasn't trying to. It creates a medieval world that never really existed but it creates that world exceptionally well, it pulled me into that world as I watched made me believe it, and isn't that what's important for a film to do?The characters all work well together, they're believable and you end up caring about them. The clothing, the scenery and the action sequences are first rate and yes, I know, not historically accurate but again, I don't care, they work for this movie. The scene where Chaucer is pacing on a railing in front of a river introducing Ledgers character was beautifully filmed, I think so every time I see it.The acting is also first rate, with the exception of the actress who plays Jocelyn's maid, who is excruciatingly bad but thankfully she doesn't have that many lines to butcher, and she is nice to look at. The rest of the actors do an excellent job and you believe they are who they are portraying from the start. I was surprised that an ex V-Jay from MTV could convincingly portray a medieval noble woman, at least one version of one, but Ms. Sossamon (sp) does a pretty good job. True, her outfits were not quite period but again, I didn't care. It's easy to overlook those things while watching this movie because somehow it all works.The banquet scene in which the medieval music they're dancing too suddenly and seamlessly changes to a David Bowie song is one of my favorite scenes from any movie. It delighted me the first time I saw it and still does every time I watch the movie. If you haven't seen it yet rent A Knights Tale and watch it with friends and family. It's a delightful movie that the whole family can enjoy. If you take it for what it is and just sit back and enjoy it you'll probably end up loving it.",A Knight's Tale
118,RolloTomasi,I have weighed it and I have measured it...,8,28 May 2001,"I knew going into `A Knight's Tale' that it featured medieval-era characters talking 21st century slang and dancing to modern-day pop music. An early scene features a small stadium watching a jousting match actually singing and clapping to `We Will Rock You.' I had been curious to see if writer/director Brian Helgeland could pull this off. His outlook must have been that these knights' competitions were the early predecessors to today's professional sports, drawing big crowds, with fans identifying with particular players more than others. The advent of the Star Player if you will. So instead of asking the audience to stretch their minds to make this comparison, he all but makes the knights' competition a modern sporting event. It's not just sports either. It's everything from people's hair to the way they talk. In doing this, Helgeland excuses himself from having to guess what kinds of slang and colloquialisms they might have used back in those days. Or maybe he's simply saying 'really, how much has people's behavior changed between then and now?' Think `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' with a bunch of strangely-dressed people running around modern-day England acting out some medieval fantasy. The film is funny, much funnier than I expected. It's all about having a good time at the movies. I applaud Helgeland for dreaming this concept up and actually making it work. As the story rolls on, it gets more serious, gains more steam, carries more weight. Mixed in with the fun are many positive messages, all there for a reason, all applicable to everyday life. Believe in yourself even when no one else does. Be good to those you cross paths with because you never know how it might pay off later (this is a HUGE one). There's many more too. Chances are, you'll leave this film feeling better than when you went in. You really can't ask for more than that. The performances are great, the kind you don't think about because they're so precise to their characters. `Knight's Tale' is a very well-cast film. Ledger is great as the flawed, smitten peasant-posing-as-knight William Thatcher.  Rufus Sewell (of `Dark City') does evil like everyone knew he could.  Most memorable though, is Paul Bettany, a riot as William's herald, who blows the doors off every other knight's herald with his exuberant, hyperbolizing introductions.It's not a masterpiece but, heck, Helgeland already won his Oscar for `L.A. Confidential.' Now it's time to have some fun. For the most part, `A Knights Tale' has not been found wanting. Grade: B",A Knight's Tale
119,tomb_92,Refreshingly decent family film,7,6 October 2009,"For so long have non-animated family films mostly been stupid, weird, wildly unbelievable and sometimes all of the above. In the case of A Knight's Tale it involves everything a family film should involve; a great, unique plot, a really great lead actor (in the form of Heath Ledger), some really funny moments, a great supporting cast and even a romance sub-plot. There are some really heart-breaking moments, some heart-stopping ones as well and the script is really well written. Sure its not historically accurate and this quite clearly isn't Ledger's best performance, but these things don't matter because I genuinely believe that this is one of very few films for all the family.

First of all, its Heath Ledger and so its a film to give a chance, and put that with the fact its one of his best performances you know you're in for a treat. A Knight's Tale isn't meant to be taken too seriously, its not historically accurate or even remotely realistic but thats one of the reason its makes such a good film. The action is well paced, and the gags make you reel in your seat in laughter. All around performance wise, you've got some of the best with Paul Bettany, Shannyn Sossamon and Rufus Sewell.The setting is done very well, perhaps the most realistic point of the film is the setting and characters.

124,Rhino Rover,Medieval Times + Rock'n Roll = Funny,8,13 May 2001,"Historical accuracy? Throw it out the window. There's not much that's going to be historically accurate about this movie set in medieval times but then again I doubt that was a very big concern when the decision came to make this movie. That much is very clear in the first minute of the movie. But if you want to thoroughly enjoy yourself at the movies, then this is the one to go to. A Knight's Tale is about a young man's desire to better himself by changing his status in society. How you ask? By becoming a knight. It's not just a simple matter of declaring yourself a knight and that's itwell actually in this movie it is that simple but there are complications towards then end of the movie but then you probably could have figured that one out without me telling you. William Thatcher (Heath Ledger) is a page to a knight by the name of Sir Ector. By a strange turn of events, we find out that Sir Ector has died not too long before his final match of a tournament. In a panic, William and the other servants of Sir Ector are frantically trying to figure out a solution. They are in desperate need of money just to feed themselves and with nothing to lose, William decides he's going to take Sir Ector's place in the final match. All he has to do is stay on his horse and they win the tournament. So begins the journey of a servant masquerading as a knight. With the help of his friends, William manages to learn how to joust and actually become quite proficient at it. So much so that he becomes the favorite at many tournaments and also the enemy of a Count Adhemar, the undefeated knight at jousting. Throw in some romance, a bunch of crazy characters and some action and you have a fun summer movie.What I liked most about this movie is that it doesn't take itself very seriously. It's no Monty Python but it is light and humorous and it exudes a charisma that not many movies do. You get a sense that the actors realize this and act for the fun of the situation. Come on, how serious do you think a movie is when they put a Nike symbol on the armor of our hero and the audience is clapping to the beat of a Queen song? I know there are those out there who are going to cringe and criticize at all the inaccuracies but if you're going to be picky, then go watch a documentary.Heath Ledger is an up and coming young star. I last saw him in The Patriot and thought he did quite a good job opposite Mel Gibson but then again, it's hard not do learn a thing or two from the veteran actor. Heath gets to exercise his comedic skills in this one and does a decent job but much of the comedic credit has to go to the supporting actors, Mark Addy, Paul Bettany and Alan Tudyk. For many of these fellows, this will be their first major Hollywood movie and judging by what I saw, you'll probably see more of them. They were absolutely hilarious especially the bantering that goes on between Bettany and Tudyk's characters. You will probably also begin to see more of Laura Fraser who plays a female blacksmith that eventually becomes part of William's little gang. I previously saw her in Titus (with Anthony Hopkins) and found her good in that movie but it was hard to tell considering how unusual Shakespeare's story was but after this movie, I expect good things from her. The movie turns a bit dramatic towards the end but it works in the context of the movie although I would have liked it more if they kept the lightness through to the end. Don't take this movie seriously or you will have missed its point completely.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was light, funny and entertaining. A great summer movie!",A Knight's Tale
125,L. Lion,"good ensemble, flatulent plotting",5,24 May 2001,"A Knight's Tale doesn't really accomplish what it sets out to do.  It wants to be a rollicking 'Rocky' story set at jousting matches.  It wants to have a contemporary flavor and still keep its period feeling.  It wants to have a double-barrelled rivalry for the hand of the lady Jocelyn - a fem-libber in a medieval world -  and the World Jousting Championship.  For the most part the film fails.  It never succeeds in developing a good villain, much suspense as to what the outcome of these competitions will be, and the intermittent use of rock and roll and then returning to a well-developed period piece is jarring.  The movie does succeed however in creating a winning ensemble cast not played up in the ads.The story, in short, is of William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), who dons his late master's armor to win a joust in the dire need to earn money to eat. Having set out on his life journey to 'change his stars' of being born a peasant, and feeling jousting professionally is something he could do, he convinces traveling companions Wat and Roland (the actors are both good but their names fail me) to invest in equipping him to continue to joust, which is off-limits to peasants - only nobility need apply.  They come upon a destitute Geoffrey Chaucer who forges them patents of nobility for one 'Ulric von Lichtenstein of Geldeland' and hit the jousting circuit, which is treated as the golf or tennis tours of the medieval period.  Jousting and swordplay are made safe by using blunt weapons and wearing armor, so that the knights don't kill each other in the name of sport.A rivalry quickly develops with a Count Ademhar (Rufus Sewell), a condescending snob and jousting champion who defeats Ulric at their first meeting.  Also, the lovely Lady Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) becomes the object of both their attentions.  Just so the audience of young girls has no way of rooting for the handsome Sewell's Ademhar, he is shown speaking of her as chattel he is preparing to buy, while William is confessing his love ardently and telling his traveling companions how birds suddenly appear every time she is near.Shannyn Sossamon, who could be Angelina Jolie's prettier younger sister, is fine as Jocelyn.  Her character is so willful, however, that it is not really conceivable that she would ever knuckle under to a chauvinist pig like Ademhar even if her family agreed to such a match.  She would don a pair of breeches, shinny out the window and elope with William.  So there is no real sense of competition, the way Rose appears tied to Billy Zane's Caledon Hocksley in Titanic.The competition goes out the window, however, as Ademhar is called away to war, leading to a winning streak by William and his party's coffers beginning to bulge with the gold of his championships.  They are destined to meet at the World Championships in London, however, just so Rocky can beat Clubber Lang once and for all.  Along the way of course William's peasant origins will be uncovered, he will fight with Jocelyn and alienate her affections (this is handled particularly clumsily), and they will flirt with financial ruin (for all of two seconds).  Most of this is done in such perfunctory manner that it is as if Brian Helgeland, who wrote and directed, was simply checking things off on his list of to-dos for the movie.The jousting scenes are nicely shot, but there are too many of them and they lack suspense, aside from the first few when William could be hurt or defeated.  The last, with an injured William jousting without armor, is the most ludicrous - it sets William up to need the equivalent of a 15th round knockout without ever giving any doubt that he will in fact achieve just that.Much has been made of the movie using modern rock on its soundtrack, to the extent that the crowd at the first joust actually chants and stomps their feet to Queen's ""We will rock you"".  I actually expected to see a troubador with an electric guitar when Brian May's guitar kicks in.  Although jarring at first, it does add flavor to the movie and works quite well in the beginning.  Then the rock goes away for long stretches and is reintroduced, such as William & Co.'s homecoming to London to ""The Boys Are Back In Town"". If you are going to make this kind of thematic choice, you have to stick with it all the way through, and have the rock soundtrack be an endemic part of the piece.  By picking and choosing where to insert, all Helgeland creates is the sensation of being jarred out of a well-developed period look and feel anew, every time the rock and roll is suddenly inserted.  The movie should have moved to a rock beat on its own, if that is the stylistic choice being made.  Of special complaint is the by-the-numbers use of Bachman Turner Overdrive's dissonant classic-rock ""Takin' Care of Business"".  If you are going to do this, be more imaginative in choosing the songs.The cast acquit themselves quite well, especially the two playing Wat and Roland.  Columbia has worked hard to advertise Heath Ledger as a matinee idol, and judging by the overwhelming female approval for this film (avg. 7.8 vs. 6.7 for the guys) it's paid off.  Ledger is handsome, winning and earnest, and carries his role well, although he is more dependent on his supporting cast than the ads suggest.  Sewell is saddled with a character so one-note there is really nothing to be done with it but load it with Snidely Whiplash and collect your check.  The Chaucer character is a bit tarty, boastful and naked too often for my taste.  In spite of the ads showing this as an action movie with jousting, this is a date flick, so see it with your lady.",A Knight's Tale
126,pro_crustes,"""Gladiator"" with laughs and heart.",8,11 October 2001,"Remember how 2000 was so bleak a film year that a lifeless remake of ""Spartacus"" won the Oscar?  Well, that was ""Gladiator,"" which tells the same story as ""A Knight's Tale,"" of a man who should be nothing much, rising to become something great.  But, Oscar notwithstanding, the previous film was, you know, kind of boring.  AKT is exciting, fun, uplifting, and has a couple of good, if familiar, pieces of music.  Carter Burwell gets the ""Music By"" credit, but it appears on screen while the music of Queen is playing, which was a strange bit of timing, to say the least.  Queen and Bowie are both in the soundtrack, and the early impression I had was that the characters would cleverly remain in-period while 20'th century music played.  Alas, this neat idea seems to have been too hard for the filmmakers, who let the anachronism get into a party scene where everyone's modern dancing should have stayed medieval.  No great harm is done by this mistake, though, and the rest of the film's simple, charming story of a peasant who pretends to be a knight so he can make big money jousting is everything you want it to be.  There's even a woman blacksmith cum sidekick, for those who insist that all such stories pretend, a la Xena/Hercules, that women could enter the professions of the ancient world.  To their credit, she doesn't make a big deal about her sex, nor does she become the hero's love interest.  She's just one of four sidekicks--one of whom is a very funny Chaucer--who work as a fine ensemble.  The real love interest, who is a snotty princess no one could love after getting to know her, is kind of annoying and hurts the film. But, there has to be a ""lady"" to fight for, and over, in a jousting movie, doesn't there?The whole thing is poppycock, but that's okay.  The jousting scenes are thrilling, the humor is funny, and the characters get only as sappy as necessary when admitting how they really feel about each other and their destinies.  There's some violence, but it's mild as movies go these days with very little (maybe too little, at times) blood on screen.  If you liked Gladiator, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Excalibur, Knight Riders (anyone remember that one?), or even The Karate Kid, you'll like this one.",A Knight's Tale

128,cormac_zoso,good god almighty,1,15 September 2014,"just what century was this film set in? the time of Camelot or in a 1990s dance club? actually, the answer is both ... how a talent like Heath Ledger ever end up in a film better suited to being dropped into the nearest sewer and praying every day that no one would ever find this celluloid atrocity.I have a monumental loathing for historical films that have little in common the historic event aside from character names (and then even that is questionable).One similar film immediately pops into my head: the Red Baron (2008). (I am certain everyone else can add a plethora of such films.) First off, WHY in the name of all that is holy does Hollywood seem to believe that the actual life of the WW1 ""Ace of Aces"" needs any embellishment (and outright lies) to make if more interesting? they are actually saying that the Red Baron, perhaps the greatest fighter pilot of all time and certainly the best know, needs to have his spectacular and exciting life pumped full of literary steroids?? No, of course it doesn't ... but they have the Canadian pilot Roy Brown and Richtoffen meeting on the ground after both their planes have been too damaged to fly on THREE DIFFERENT occasions ... an they're all chummy too ... good lord anyway, this 'knight's tale' has many many flaws ... frankly, if people danced and behaved in such a matter back then, they would have been burned at the stake.

131,rastaban3,Pretty good.,6,15 November 2001,"""A Knight's Tale"" is a pretty good story of a peasant that becomes knight against some pretty hefty odds.  I enjoyed the plot progression and the decision making of the main character, Thatcher.  I also liked the fact the Thatcher made a point to find his long lost father and bring him pride again.  Back then, it was up to the children to bring pride to the parents and it was the most important goal any parent could have.  In most cases, that is the case today as well today's children realize it or not.  I liked that this film made a point to show that.  The jousting scenes were very good and were consistent with the story line.  All of these really helped the film.  However, there was one, very nagging problem with the film. The sound track was terrible and really detracted from the story.  So much so I actually turned the sound down at times.  Music did not match the film's time in anyway.  If the right music had been chosen for this film, it would have been much better.Over all,  pretty good and worth a look.  (6 out of 10).",A Knight's Tale

As I entered the theater, I didn't know what to expect from the film, except jousting and romance. When I walked out of the theater, I couldn't believe how funny the film was! So many scenes in the film were a riot it would be impossible to list them all.Not that the film is a comedy in its entirety of course. There is a fair amount of drama, as well as romance. Some of the plot was cliche, but given the mood of the film, it was forgivable. It's certainly not trying to be a medieval Gladiator, and as a matter of fact, appears to actually be parodying the Roman epic in several instances.While some may find the idea of modern music playing to the actions and setting, it actually works quite well. The opening scene had the theater roaring with laughter because it was genuinely silly and was indeed a fine artistic choice. The actors all fit their roles perfectly and made them work well.If you like medieval films, action, or just want to have a good laugh, I'd say watch this film. This could turn out to be one of the bigger surprises of the year.",A Knight's Tale
133,ufo0001,Good medieval romp,7,6 May 2002,"Pros: Jousting scenes.Cons: Looks like the work of a first time director, historically innacurate, Paul Bettany.A knight's tale is the new film by Brian Helgeland (penned the classic L.A Confidential) that stars Heath Ledger as a servant of a knight who strives for great things after death takes his master. Armed with his friends, a writer by the name of Chauncer, and a female blacksmith who carves nike symbols on her armor, they take on Rufus Sewell who plays the snidely villian at the world championships at jousting. Shannon Sossammon plays the love interest for Ledger.  While the jousting scenes are spectacular, they tend to get a bit repetitive and also the movie doesn't even strive to  be accurate (for example, the clothing worn looks like the times but smacks of present day influences, plus the shoes look like shoes of today). With all this shortcomings, a Knight's tale must be viewed as a summer movie which doesn't take itself too seriously. This is why it performed well at the box-office. Some scenes are quite funny, the acting is subpar at best and Shannon Sossammon is eye candy, plus the morality tale it tags on seems out of place in this times since feudalism doesn't exist, a knight's tale is a medieval frolic that doesn't distance the audience of mordern times.

He shows signs of the greatness that is to come forth in later films. He is surrounded by a great supporting cast which helps make the film watchable.The problem for me is the story. It is a story that has been told too many times. It appears to not know what it wants to be, either a comedy or a drama. It never takes off as a comedy and has too many so-called funny scenes to be considered a drama. Besides all of that it is absolutely unbelievable. i did not find the use of modern music to be funny, which is strange since i love the absurd.

137,Rirath_com,"Pure fun, if you know how to have fun.",8,30 June 2004,"A Knight's Tale is what you get when you cross underdog sports drama, comedy, medieval knights, and a healthy dose of Gen X attitude. William Thatcher is a nobody, son of a peasant, fascinated with knights. When the knight he's serving dies before the final round of a joust, William takes a chance and assumes his identity.The show wastes no time whatsoever getting straight to the fun stuff. The above paragraph is the very first thing you'll see in the movie, and the very next is the movie's first joust set to Queen's We Will Rock You. The twist here isn't just a cheap soundtrack, but the fact that it's interwoven into the movie itself. The jousting audience is more of a football crowd, clapping along to the legendary beat and having fun. The herald trumpet players are even shown to belt a few notes, while the guards step along.The best example I can think of this previously is Robin Hood: Men in Tights. A Knight's Tale takes it one step farther however by taking it all very seriously. By the end of the show you could almost believe it. Heralds that sound more like boxing announcers, armor with famous looking logos, ultra modern hair and outfits, and even an amazing dance sequence that blends classical with modern set to David Bowie. It's a highlight of the movie and worth watching just for that scene alone.The best thing I can say about A Knight's Tale is how real it all is, despite it's theme. The modern aspects are blended into the events with real tact, the comedy is honestly funny, and the drama is in no way cheapened by the lightheartedness. It's not exactly Oscar material, but the show has a few honestly dramatic and heart touching moments that are go over extremely well to anyone but scoffing critics.If you've ever had even a slight fascination with Knights and the joust, give this a watch. It's a great movie filled with all the fun and wit one could ask for. The Gen X attitude may seem like a gimmick, but if you're as tired as I am of lame actors speaking in extremely poor old English, this movie is for you.",A Knight's Tale

139,timelord-3,Wacky mixture of modern and classic,6,22 August 2001,"I did a search for 'knight' on IMDB and it came up with around 140 title matches - there certainly are a lot of movies with the word 'knight' in them.The latest to be added to the heap is the Heath Ledger vehicle 'A Knight's Tale' - a hi energy middle ages romp  with all the modern trimmings so the target audience of 12-17 year olds don't get confused.So, to cater to this audience, A Knight's Tale forgoes any notion of a coherent plot, throws out the window any attempt at characterisation, and laughs in the face of any idea of believability.The plot in a nutshell (and believe me, it could fit in there - even with large type) is our boy Heath gets a taste for jousting after sitting in for a recently deceased Knight and decides that he can do it himself and enters the competition.  He doesn't let a small detail that he is not of noble blood deter him - he just gets a naked Jeffrey Chaucer (don't ask) to forge some documents for him and voila!, he is a Knight!And it wouldn't be a proper film for our boy if he didn't get to romance and bed a lovely lady along the way would it?You know you are in for a rocky ride within the first two minutes; not only is the theme tune for the first jousting match Queen's 'We Will Rock You' - but the entire crowd and participants of the tournament are bashing their hands and chanting along with the music!  A later scene involving dancing bizarrely morphs into a dirty dancing romp set to David Bowie's 'Golden Years'.All the characters are basically time travellers from the modern day plonked in the past - they have all the modern mannerisms that just did not exist back then (witness the line ""It's called a lance... Hello?"" that features in the trailer prominently).  This wouldn't be so bad if the movie settled on a style and stuck to it; it veers from comedy to drama to romance and back to comedy again over its unwelcome length of close to 2 hours.And nobody appeared to have briefed Rufus Sewwell that he was to play it for laughs - his seriousness throughout the entire film is a testament to his acting ability.  Or perhaps it was too late by the time he realised what sort of film he was in and he decided to 'grin and bear it'.Alan Tudyk and Mark Addy provide the only constant throughout the entire film - they are under no illusions of being any more than comic relief and the modern anchors for the audience to cling to.  Paul Bettany as 'Geoff' Chaucer is pretty good - but he doesn't get much to do after his initial introduction.The movie works best when it decides to go for the true drama of the situation - Heath's dilemma in the closing 15 minutes; his reuniting with his father, and his battle with the future King of England.  It descends into self parody and anarchy for the remainder.The romantic interest is distracting and quite frankly boring - the only mildly attractive lady plays hard to get for so long you wonder why Heath kept pursuing her.I wouldn't want to create the impression that I didn't like this film - there is plenty to chuckle at - but the fact I was chuckling rather than being given a good jousting film was a bit of a let down.  The jousting scenes themselves are pretty good and well staged, but the sets themselves seem very small - surely jousting competitions were held over a larger area than what is portrayed?All in all 'A Knights Tale's is reasonably entertaining fare that will certainly appeal to its target audience as long as they are not too put off by the modern touches in what is primarily a period piece.  6 out of 10.",A Knight's Tale
140,ericolsen1953,Fun flick. Music IRRITATING.,7,1 January 2005,"Don't know why, but the director thought it'd be a cute idea to interpose rock 'n roll into a story set in the 11th century. It's doesn't work, except to irritate. Sometimes, the songs are played so loud, you miss some important dialog (I think, but who knows?!?!) Have tried to buy the DVD without the rock music, but it can't be had. Perhaps the director doesn't want to ruin a ""masterpiece"" or some such rot. Otherwise, enjoyed the plot & characters, especially one or two beautiful women. They were directed and scripted without too much of the dreary political-correctness that ""film people"" seem to think is so so necessary these days. Near the end of the movie, with poor Heath's head locked in the Public Stocks for the crime of impersonating a noble, I was afraid that some inauthentic superwoman would ride into the jousting tournament, complete with a stainless-steel-Madonna-pointy-bra, unhorse every male knight, reveal herself as the future Queen of Britain, free our hero's head from the Boards of Punishment, and ride off with her socially-emasculated boyfriend over her saddle, through the gates of Windsor Castle, or some similar drivel.

143,OldRose,The Year of Revisionist Musicals,9,9 December 2001,"Ahead of going to see this film I didn't know if I'd see comedy, satire, serious drama, or a farce (!). I'm relieved to say that in the very best sense of the terms, this film contains all the elements and came off magnificently. Like the recent ""Moulin Rouge"" we have an old story with a modern musical adaptation. 'Revisionist' admittedly, but how many people could have borne either film with the true music of the respective ages...? I'd wager: not many. 'Story' is important, so is humour, and this film has both. Heath Ledger needed a strong springboard after ""The Patriot"" and a nearly unequaled performance therein. He got it... and much, much more. From start to finish the film is witty, humorous, clever, and then when the moments matter: dramatic, serious, sensitive and tender. All this in a film that will qualify for the Comedy & Musical Category of the Golden Globes as does ""Moulin Rouge"", and like the latter, I expect to see many an award nomination bestowed.Rufus Sewell plays a convincing bad guy, but it's Paul Bettany who scores the 'Breakthrough Performance' and should garner nominations for same. Heath Ledger could well garner a nomination himself as he was nothing short of stunning and brilliant in the starring role. This required a lot more than a pretty smile and outstanding background music. As a Knight would, he carried the day... and Bravo to him! James Purefoy adds the crowning touch as the Jungian Shadow of our hero, someone who must play the same games for very different reasons. A five star movie from the opening gunshot, the only flaw noted happens early and shan't be disclosed (go and see if you can find it).

If you go in hoping to see another ""Braveheart"", you'll be disappointed.  If you go in hoping to see another ""Messenger"", you need therapy, because that movie stunk.My point is that ""A Knight's Tale"" is just well-done fun, although the first 45 minutes drag a bit.

Fun in that it's creative; in that it makes you want to dance; in that it actually has a storyline and intelligence, (and that lets you know you haven't wasted your money). You feel good watching this and you want more.I went in excited to see Ledger again and see what Helgeland could do, but still expecting your average teeny bopper fare, which I despise. I was surprised at how well everything went together. The acting is good, Thatcher and his motley crew steal the show, and Adhemar personifies the evil villain. The visuals (from cinematography to action to costumes to choreography) are brilliant and walk hand in hand with the rock/modern music this film is drenched in.There's only one flaw I can think of. The script, written by Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential) is a tad unpolished. It could have been amazing if he had put some more background to the characters, deepened the leading lady, put one or two more twists in, and had some more of the villain. But all that is forgivable, except that you end up wishing it had gone on just a little longer to learn more about characters you eventually fall in love with.Don't expect a history lesson.

156,kaylenns,HORRIBLE AWFUL DON'T WASTE A PENNY ON IT! (SPOILERS),1,13 May 2001,"This is absolutely the WORST movie I have ever seen in the theatres.  It lacks cohesion, a competent cast, any sense whatsoever of a film soundtrack, and anything resembling a script.  The only highlights were Alan Tudyk (who was consistent, hilarious, and vein-popping), Paul Bettany (who somehow managed to be one of the only cast members who didn't butcher his lines), and Laura Fraser (who was completely underused).  I found Heath Ledger to be inconsistent (though I liked him in ""10 Things...""), and Shannyn Sossamon to be entirely bland and derivative.  Rufus Sewell managed to look lost and primarily bored  throughout most of his scenes.  Apart from the cast, the script was pathetic and patched together.  I felt like the creators had gone to see ""Gladiator"" in mid-production, and had decided to include a couple of rip-off scenes: bad guy head floating dream-like above the ground at the end, and a totally useless hero-in-a-cell-with-bad-guy-punching-said-hero scene that was completely reminiscent of the Maximus-Commodus cell scene. The worst part, however, was the soundtrack.  A soundtrack can make or break a film, and this one definitely broke it.  I may have been able to suspend disbelief and annoyance with the characters if I had felt that the medieval environment that they existed in was intact.  However, I felt that it was really nothing more than a bunch of people dressed up at a Renaissance Fair making a movie.  When the bad guy left the dance hall while all the principals were doing the funky chicken to some derivative pop music, I wanted to go with him.  Put together a dumb plot, lame characters (for the most part), action which was centered around jousting--which has got to be one of the dumbest pursuits known to man--and a lot of badly-executed, already-lacking dialogue, and what you have is a movie that should never have been made.  Even the blonde eye-candy appeal of Ledger couldn't quite pull off the film.  Please don't waste your money.",A Knight's Tale
157,enazwo,A Good Night of Knightly Fun,7,4 November 2005,"A Knights Tale Jesting and Jousting There is no way I should have liked this movie. As a matter of fact I'm astounded that I enjoyed myself so much.""A Knights Tale"" is without a doubt one of the most poorly researched and technically inaccurate timepiece movies to ever hit the screen. The odd thing is that apparently the makers of this film were well aware of these oversights as they also heaped a number of anarchism's on top for good measure.This movie defines going to the movies for a good time. I think really this movie is more about having a good time enjoying oneself then it is about being a knight and jousting.The story begins with the death of a aging tournament knight before the final round of a tournament. His three starving squires are in quandary so one of them, William Thatcher, (Heath Ledger, ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", ""The Patriot""), dons the knight suit and ineptly wins the final round of the tournament.William concocts a hair-brained scheme to masquerade as real knight, arguing, ""A man can change his stars"" to his two fellow squires. After some hi jinks and carrying on, his partners, Roland, (Mark Addy), and Wat, (Alan Tudky), reluctantly agree.So they use a portion of their winnings for training and begin training to get William ready for a fast approaching tournament.On their way to the tournament they encounter the character Chaucer, played with wallowing comic brilliance by Paul Bettany. Chaucer added tons-o-humor and spiced the story up in an unexpected way.This movie had all the simplistic entertainment tools you could imagine and hammed them up with a drunken relish. There's the courageous love of a father for his son, the goodness and loyalty of friends, forbidden love separated by class, women's equality, unexpected honor by the ruling class, and a bad guy in black.The use of 70's and 80's rock anthems threw me for a loop, especially in the beginning, which nearly caused me to instantly start hating the movie. Then it occurred to me that, ""Oh they're being funny"".So if you are a movie timepiece purist you will be doing yourself, as well as the rest of us, a favor by avoiding ""A Knight's Tale"". This movie is played for fun and great laughs.Once again it still amazes me that I could have enjoyed myself so much at this movie. And for the record I was not drunk or on medication either.Sometimes we experience things that are an unexpected pleasure and generally we don't get over analytical. After seeing ""A Knight's Tale"" I did spend some time accessing my reasons why I liked this movie so much. Ultimately though I just went with the feeling of ""Hey just be thankful something this fun and exciting comes along every now and then.""",A Knight's Tale

It's entertainment, not a documentary. What more could you possibly want?As for historical accuracy...are you kidding? Since when has history ever been accurate? I thought Paul Bettany's portrayal of Chaucer alone was well worth the price of admission. He actually brings Chaucer...I mean, Chaucer, for heaven's sake...to life, something no staid history book has ever been able to do.

The film is typical of a fairy tale in that you know exactly what is going to happen and to whom; you want it to happen; it does happen, and far from being disappointed you are absolutely delighted and even relieved.The actors from beginning to end are 100% charismatic and the viewer gets swept along like on a roller coaster ride in the tunnel of love with thrills and spills and oohs and aahs and genuine romance and even, (dare one say it these days), love - complete with love-letters and poetry.  The music is amazing - as far from Mediaeval music as it is possible to be, and yet perfect nonetheless, and some of the modernisms, such as the Mexican wave in the crowd at the joust are superbly entertaining.Not a film for the cynical or those afraid of looking at the world with childlike innocence, but it is their loss; for the rest of us it is a film to be seen and enjoyed time after time after time.",A Knight's Tale
160,sbrobin,What a ridiculous film!,7,14 May 2001,"As another user commented, this film is incredibly ridiculous.  As the film starts, you hear ""We Will Rock You"" playing in the background. Okay, I thought, they took modern music and set it to the movie.  Pretty absurd, but it might be cool.  Then as they showed the audience and I thought it couldn't get any crazier, I noticed they were actually singing it!  This film doesn't simply try to modernize itself by throwing in twentieth century pop-culture, it actually incorporates it.  At one point, someone says ""Can I get a shout-out for London!""  About the only thing they didn't do in this film was have anyone ""raise the roof!""  Yet surprisingly enough, all of this campiness works and provides for a fun and entertaining movie.
After about 20 minutes, you begin to accept the campiness of the film and enjoy it.  You realize how absurd it is, but just don't care. The director took a huge gamble with these ideas, but I think it pays off well.  You just need to get over the historical inacuracies and corniness of a Knight's Tale and enjoy. Most people in the theater were laughing with the film, not at it.While not the greatest film ever made, it certainly is a successful one, and provides for an entertaining picture that many should enjoy.",A Knight's Tale
161,ZeTomes,"Let me rephrase - A Tale, of a Knight's one",7,14 June 2011,"Yes, as the title says it's a tale, a fictional story told by someone independently from its time and historicity. This tale was told by the bard Brian Helgeland and it's a refreshing, slushy, musical, theatrical, and epic one like Robin Hoood's, also, it has excellent actors a very fluid narrative, magic, utopia and astonishing costumes and scenarios.It reminds me Moulin Rouge and its recycling style.I think this is one of the wrongly rated movies just because of pretentious historical arguments - perhaps those judging didn't understand the paragraph above, that this movie is in fact, a tale! Told by someone living in modern times who triggered merged chronological images from the tales he'd listened or a description of our contemporary archetype of a medieval tale merging past and present. Either philosophizing or not this film is clearly and obviously a fusion. In my opinion I think there were only a few bad choices which sounded exaggerated to the audience, perhaps the reasons for the low rating and perhaps the director's will to peremptorily justify that indeed this movie is concerning fiction and not historical acuity, overexposing the first minutes of it: the ""We will Rock You"" initial musical score interacting with the medieval contest, exaggeratedly slushy and without convincing extras. It sounded pompous. I was about to quit this one.But one should move on (in some cases indeed one shouldn't) and rate a movie not by its pieces but by its whole, continuing to check if the initial impressions were right. In my case they weren't. I was surprised. For the rest I'll take my hat to a very entertaining, humorous and fresh piece of work with very talented acting.

I have to confess that the screenplay is sharply written, mixing canterbury's tale guidelines with humour and today's English, playing with anachronism without chocking effects. the soundtrack fits completely with this global feeling. the photo is original, and the actors'casting and direction works, but mainly for the benefit of the story, and not for any actor's performance.

The film relied on unsuccessful gimmicks in an attempt to rescue a pitifully simple plot, wooden acting, and boring action scenes.  Product placement in movies is always annoying, but the Nike symbols on the armor were just too much. About the only thing this film got right is the costumes, which were nice.

What promises to be a fun lark turns into a complete hack job bringing out every cliche in the book.  Although he handles it as if he expects us to -- was the director seriously expecting anyone to be moved by the ridiculous subplot of Ledger's long lost blind father?  And that's just one ridiculous cliche we're supposed to swallow.   I won't detail the rest because I'd spoil the movie.The action scenes are also handled really badly.  There is one shot of the jousting stick hitting the knight which was exciting the first time I saw it.  It wasn't very exciting the 20th time I saw it.

Before I knew it I was the filmmaker's puppet cheering and jeering when he wanted it. To me this was another clear sign of a bad trailer. I know he isn't the main character, but I feel this film is like Shakespeare in Love for Goeffrey Chaucer and how he came up with The Canterbury Tales.

168,VisionThing,Good enough to be disappointing,5,5 April 2004,"The starless cast, the director with but one mediocre movie under his belt, and especially the cheesy idea of combining medieval imagery with modern pop music (indicating either a half-muled attempt of modernization to attract teen audience, or alternatively sheer silliness for silliness' sake) all seemed to spell TURKEY with Brobdingnagian flaming letters. However, A Knight's Tale turned out to be moderately entertaining watch-with-your-brain-switched-off film.Two out of my three main concerns were actually the strong points of this movie: the unorthodox music selections actually work surprisingly well and blend to the action, and the cast is excellent -- especially fresh and vivid Shannyn Sossamon playing the main character's love interest and Rufus Sewell portraying the ominous rival suitor stand out. When so much is done right, it is all the more annoying that both the storyline and the characters lack depth and inventiveness completely.The genre clichés, silly dialog and tame twists would not be enough to spoil the movie, but at least I found the emotional manipulation in this film to be exasperatingly clumsy, like one syllable words being mouthed to a deaf idiot child. There were no two sides to nor nuances in anything, and especially towards the end there were several scenes that had no motivation or reasoning apart from making you feel in a certain way (listing them here would spoil the movie, but they should be quite obvious to spot). A good movie is engineered to affect viewer's emotions, but this influencing should be subtle; in this case you could not only see the strings, you could also see the hands of the puppeteer. I felt underestimated as a viewer, but then (as nowadays usually seems to be the case), probably that's simply because I am not the target audience for this movie...If the storyline could at some points be replaced with plates like ""Feel joy"" or ""Hate this guy"", the characters do not offer much more, the whole lot is of the cardboard variety. The hero is spirited, his nemesis is evil and treacherous, the lady is flimsy and bratty (modern adaptation of a mysterious woman? :), female blacksmith is female and blacksmith, and so on.

With jousting and some cool coliseum-styled action, this movie is surprising in the fact that a movie without killing or any fantasy, did so well at being a good movie.The movie is about a poor squire (Ledger), that after the death of his master, fakes nobility and enters himself in a jousting tournament. After training and a couple of games, Ledger becomes a pro and goes up the ladder (even beating the prince/king/whatever, who somewhat resembles Thomas Jane, in one round). Facing off against a narcissistic a noble (Sewell) multiple times, it seems he'll never win the championship. But he perseveres and still keeps on trying, after a few times where he almost quits.This movie is very original in the way that it's a sports film, set before pictures could even be taken.

Heath Ledger stars as William Thatcher, a peasant who poses as a dead knight in order to gain wins in many jousting tournaments around Europe. He gets help from many friends. His one big target is Sir Attmar, who is the main villain of the movie. This movie was a lot of fun, and had some historically accurate points.

The film is written and directed by Brian Helgeland and after I saw the movie I see how a director may be able to work more effectively with his own writing, he knows exactly what he wants from every line of dialog to character's facial expressions. Surprisingly funny throughout, it also has numerous lovable characters who should of probably been involved more. The romance in the film just ends up being a little meandering just due to me not being a fan of that genre to the characters transforming to pretty clichéd ones st these times. There are strong performances not really from the lead, Heath Ledger but from the supporting actors of Paul Bettany and a minor role yet extremely enjoyable one played by James Purefoy. Emotionally, it involves you and you sentimentally care. Tge entire film is pretty limited in it's enviorment/setting but you'll forget it due to so many funny and original scenarios always occurring. The score of the film keeps it alive as well because of the soundtrack not being filled with such dramatic music but more ""hip"" and giddy songs that actually portray the scenes quite well, they fit perfectly.

I think people are missing the point, because they thought it was going to be a film like Braveheart. A Knight's Tale is a story which is set in medieval times, and as a JOKE, they have mixed in things that weren't around at that time, such as the Nike sign, and Ulrich being introduced by Chaucer before his matches.The story is predictable, but in my view that doesn't really matter in a comedy if it makes you laugh on the way.

Contemporary sensibility assumes that the Middle Ages were one long unrelieved landscape of suffering, repression and despair, relieved, if you can call it that, only by religion. Much the opposite is the case, as fans of the bawdy Chaucer--a major figure in the movie--will attest. Lusty characters, over the top spectacle, good vs. evil morality plays, and a love of popular music were all very much a part of life in the Middle Ages. ""A Knight's Tale"" has the courage to take its subject matter on its own terms, conventional assumptions about it be damned. Along the way it provides a rollicking good time, and a few lumps in the throat for good measure.

There were moments when this movie was riotously funny.  The cardboard Villain who acted like Jude Law was annoying, the complete disregard for any historical accuracy was aggravating, and it was real hard to get into the jousting when it was blatantly obvious that Ledger's opponents weren't even aiming for him, uh, right how hard would it be to beat guys who are purposely missing you because the jousting choreographer, that guy standing over there in the crowd like an extra, told you to.  Get my drift, this was a movie, and you knew it was a movie when you were watching it, and it made no attempt to try and relate a true to life experience to the people who actually lived at that time, who actually jousted for a living, who actually fell in love, who actually valiantly broke the rules and lived on the edge.  There was so much that could have been savored and explored in this film had the filmmakers given the time period half a chance, but instead they pumped it full of popculture steriods so that it was oozing from the pores so that all the gen x'ers and younger would scramble by the hordes to see the dubiously skinny Heath Ledger ride a horse with a lance lashed to his arm.  The only thing I have to say to the moviemakers is so much for taking the potential power you had to move us, and transport us to a time and place that transcends us in exchange for making the faux-pas ""cool"" movie of the summer, wow, GREAT trade off.",A Knight's Tale
179,moonlightreflections,Unbelievably entertaining!,8,2 June 2001,"It's a relief to know that despite the inherent triteness of the root-for-the-underdog genre, there is still something out there that can be applied to give these movies a new, fancier, hard-hitting edge.  In the case of ""A Knight's Tale,"" the new edge comes in the form of anachronistic elements: a classic rock soundtrack, a decidedly flashy presentation and a motley crew of streamlined characters all contribute to the general campiness of the bread-and-butter-natured subject matter.Heath Ledger plays the role of William, a young squire who by a twist of fate is granted his lifelong yearning--to compete in the national jousting tournaments.  Along for the journey come the unbelievably hackneyed companions: Roland, the dependable one in the group, who follows and supports unconditionally;  Wat, the zany, but down-to-earth childhood friend who is the only one who thinks in a rational line of thought;  Chaucer, a writer who provides most of the movie's witty dialogue and can't seem to keep his clothes on for more than a minute;  and Kate, the blacksmith, which by the very nature of her profession is construed to be a feminist.After a couple seconds of jousting, the movie dictates that William should fall madly in love with Lady Jocelyn, played by Shannyn Sossamon with unnerving conviction (as a local newspaper review so eloquently put it, ""Jocelyn is a gorgeous prop with considerably less personality than the horses"").  Lo and behold, however, another gentleman by the name of Count Adhemar has decided to joust for the lovely lady as well, and an epic rivalry entrenches itself into the storyline, developing as formulaically as night turning into day.This initial setup makes any type of prospect for the film incredibly grim; thankfully, it's the film's very own innovations that salvage it from mediocrity and create something spectacularly entertaining.  Medieval crowds at a jousting tournament do the wave, armors are branded with a Nike logo to signify who its maker is, crowds scurry to catch helmets that fly towards them in a fashion not unlike that of foul balls, and William is so unbelievably (and modernly) naive that at one point he uses the water in a cathedral to slick back his hair.  It all sounds very corny, to be certain, but the film executes all of this with an air of innocence which carries through to the viewer remarkably well.  In the initial minutes of the movie the lighthearted aspects immediately make themselves felt in a way that says, ""This is natural.  You will take it.  You will like it.  You will be amused by it.""This film doesn't attempt to be profound at all.  In fact, subjects such as good vs. evil and love, even though they play a role in the film, are never discussed.  Love emerges because of raw physical attraction, and good and evil are delineated by either good looks or an evil stare.  Shades of grey are represented by--well, they don't exist.  Everything is as clear-cut as the fact that this is mind-numbing entertainment, but its execution reminds us all that it's not a sin to have fun once in a while.  Too many people in this age are concerned with the underlying messages of just about everything in order to give a meaning to today's materialistic world.  ""A Knight's Tale"" simply reminds us that there's still a possibility for anything.8/10",A Knight's Tale

Roland & Wat could be the same status with William but the position is changed, William became a knight but the two still be squires. However, they didn't complain and jealous because that's their choice. Nobody would know the result if you take a risk, after all, no start, no any opportunity to success. By the way, I like the design about Jocelyn's dresses, they are excellent as Natalie Portman's Queen's dresses in ""Star War: Phantom Manence"".

But after curiously browsing through the track listing on the soundtrack, and finding the one utterly fabulous David Bowie on the soundtrack, I figured it couldn't be all that bad.  When the theater lights faded and the movie began, I was torn between two simultaneous urges to laugh out loud at the fact that the jousting fans were stomping right along to ""We Will Rock You"" and to join right in.  This scene says it all... this movie was not designed to provide it's audience with a deep and profound message of how peasants are persecuted by nobility, nor it is designed to leave the audience feeling deeply connected with the situations the characters have faced - this movie was made to make you laugh (and it most certainly does), make you cheer (if you didn't... what is the matter with you?), and make you want to savor every devilishly witty moment. For those of you purists... swallow your pride and wallow in the sinful delights of ""A Knight's Tale"" - the most sinful being that of Paul Bettany's portrayl of Geoffrey Chaucer... certainly Chaucer did not possess the physical aspects of Bettany, but the personality is incredibly fitting.

Alan delivers. Paul delivers. And Bobby B delivers.The chemistry of the cast gives such a depth and honesty to the comedy. You find yourself cheering for Sir Ulrich with the crowd. The love story is tolerable.My little brother was obsessed with this movie and he'd insist on having it on all the time while he ran around the house playing knight. I should hate this movie for all the times I was forced to watch it. But I love it.Look at Django, which was met with such acclaim, are the rap songs out of place? No, it's a tie in of our modern world with this past one. These are the moments that created the necessity in an artist to make this music. For hype, for entertainment, for a story. Queen made We Will Rock You to get a crowd pumped, David made Golden Years to get you moving, and the Boys Are Back is just a great intro song.Also that kid they got to be little Heath is just too adorable.Watch it, love it, and miss Heath.",A Knight's Tale

Hero and heavy are both first rate, as are the supporting characters.  I have seen many medieval stories, but none that so intensely focuses on the business of jousting. The Czech stuntmen make it clear that you are not at medieval times, but watching something as serious as rodeo work.",A Knight's Tale
186,mikerichards,A very silly movie and all the better for it,8,31 August 2001,"Geoffrey Chaucer wrote about a knight's tale in his Canterbury Tales, he also pops up in this movie as a frequently nude gambling addict, but I think that's about all the two have in common. It is quite possible that the studio wanted to produce a blockbusting version of Canterbury Tales, but correctly reasoned that a satirical look at late medieval pilgrimage wasn't going to be a smash hit, took the title and ran with it.This is a high concept movie - so high concept that it probably suffers from vertigo. It is also very silly - fortunately it knows that. Think of what you would get in the result of a multiple pileup between 'Ivanhoe', 'Rocky', 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' and whole lot of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and you are pretty close to 'A Knight's Tale'. So poor boy masquerades as a well-heeled knight, tours Europe with his faithful sidekick, becomes the number one smash hit on the jousting circuit, wins the heart of the girl and finds himself on the wrong side of the local rogue.
And that's it - no worries over the feudal system, plague, the Crusades, the intricacies of medieval language and certainly not the music. This is a modern film for modern people with very short attention spans.
For some reason the movie has been the subject of huge amounts of outrage for not being a faithful rendition of the period. Which is very strange; when Shakespeare is updated to modern Manhattan or the ghetto the makers are applauded for making it relevant. Two years ago, everyone loved 'Shakespeare in Love' for its topical references. Okay, 'A Knight's Tale' isn't *that* good, but neither did it claim to be anything more than pure entertainment. It has great fun with its WWF (the wrestlers not the animal lovers) and Nike references and the rock soundtrack. If you are likely to be offended, go watch the BBC's adaptation of 'Ivanhoe' and revel in its hurdy gurdy music and beards the size of rose bushes.Acting wise its a mixed affair. Heath Ledger is perfectly good as William, but like most modern heroes is underwritten. His love interest, Jocelyn, is devastatingly beautiful, but has all the charisma of a wet blanket. Rufus Sewell plays the villain with the lip-smacking relish of someone knowing that being the Sheriff of Nottingham did Alan Rickman no harm at all. In my opinion the best part is Paul Bettany as Chaucer who gets all the best lines and the most opportunity to play the crowd. Script wise it isn't memorable, but I can't remember many horrible lines either.Once again the Czech Republic stands in for medieval Europe and looks splendid. The armour, weapons and horses are suitably authentic and beautifully done. The jousts themselves are well shot and reasonably exciting, so no problems there.Once again let me say - this is a no-brainer movie. You will learn absolutely nothing about the period but who cares? This is a summer movie after all and up against the limp opposition of the last few months stands to do quite well. So leave your brain at home and have fun down at the jousts.",A Knight's Tale
187,wilm-1,Awful movie,3,28 February 2002,"A silly movie with a very weak plot that is made at times unbearable by the inclusion of dated 70s rock music. I think it might appeal to children under the age of 14, but that's about it. To bad to see a good cast wasted on this oddity.",A Knight's Tale

This really enjoyable so I recommend this movie if you need to motivate yourself.",A Knight's Tale
189,kaos-23,Not revolutionary but very entertaining,8,5 September 2004,"There's not a lot to say about this film. It's an above-average example of its genre, with enough of everything to keep the viewer entertained: jousting and sword fighting action, lighthearted romance, humour, great costumes and scenery, and eye candy in the form of Heath Ledger, Rufus Sewell, Shannyn Sossamon and Laura Fraser.The story is fairly predictable from start to finish. When his noble master dies, peasant boy William Thatcher takes his place in a jousting match and wins. This gives him the idea of making a living by winning jousting tournaments. Only problem; you have to be a noble (a knight), so William pretends to be Sir Ulrich of Lichtenstein, helped out by his two friends. Along the way he meets Geoffrey Chaucer, yes, THAT Geoffrey Chaucer, played brilliantly by Paul Bettany as a dissolute gambler with a good heart and a silver tongue. They are also joined by Kate, a farrier, armorer and feminist centuries before her time. Big thumbs up for making her character attractive, intelligent and strong-minded.  From then on things develop exactly as you would expect. There's a gorgeous love interest, a smoldering villain (played hammily but brilliantly by Rufus Sewell), a number of action scenes and some heart-rending emotional stuff when William revisits his childhood home. The only real surprise in the film is the incorporation of rock music like Queen and Thin Lizzy, such as the beginning where the excited crowd at the jousting sings 'We Will Rock You.' These musical interludes, perhaps inspired by Baz Luhrmann films such as 'Moulin Rouge', give the film an edge and make it stand out from other medieval action flicks.Other than that, the film never particularly surprising, but it's very good. The script is sparkling and witty and the film never loses its energy. It is especially good at giving you a humorous if not totally authentic feel for the period, e.g. the crowds at the jousting who are just like football crowds, and the taunting between the English and French supporters in the tavern. All in all, this film is very entertaining and a fun way to spend a couple of hours. It won't change your life or make you think until your head hurts, but it's well-made, professionally acted, and looks and sounds great. After some consideration, I give it 8/10.",A Knight's Tale

191,fepp,Modern sports fandom translated to the middle ages,8,20 January 2002,"This movie is absolutely wonderful, if NOT taken as a ""serious"" knights-swords-and-fair-ladies movie.  There is not a single battle in it, no thrones are defended, no damsels in distresss. All there is is the play around the sports version of war: tournaments. The main character becomes a major sports star, and it is really a movie about how an everyday man grows into a big star, overcomes difficulty and a terrible adversary, and wins the lady of his heart.  And a big pile of money. The best part of the movie is the way in which they weave modern elements (especially music) into an medieval setting. Details like sports sponsors (watch out for the Nike-like swoosh :) ), prize money, sports pages in ""newspapers"", fandom, supporters with painted phases, audiences shouting the name of their favorites... all very NOT medieval, but enjoyable nontheless.

193,gremma,What a great idea of a movie!,8,22 June 2008,"I don't remember this movie in theaters or what critics had to say about it. Then it occurred to me that it opened in later 2001 in theaters around here. Then I realized it went unnoticed because everyone was consumed with The Trade Center.A successful movie needs to have interesting or likable characters with a great relationship. The relationship between William, Roland, Geoff, Kate, and Wat (Heath Ledger, Mark Addy, Paul Bettany, Laura Fraser, and Alan Tudyk) was interesting, comical, and dynamic.The movie's soundtrack kept many people from enjoying this movie, but that's their loss. It was well written and well acted. The characters drew us into their world very well. There were many very good scenes, some funny, some touching, and some heart tugging. The scene when Roland and Geoff (Addy, Bettany) are teaching William (Ledger) to dance is hilarious. Near the end of the movie when William's true identity is discovered and he is being advised to run is moving to the point you may even find yourself voicing your own vote. The heart tugging scene for me was when William, upon returning to London, finds his father. William goes to his old neighborhood and finds out from speaking with a little girl that not only his father (Christopher Cazenove) still alive but is now blind. William goes to his father as a Knight bringing him news of his son. The father inquires first if his son is alive, then is he well, and then asks, has he followed his feet (a reference from an earlier scene) and William responds that he has. They have a wonderful reunion.The events and characters were interesting enough that I would gladly have gone to a sequel of this movie (too late now).

194,loopydate,The most significant film of the past year,10,6 June 2002,"Last May, I had just finished my first year of college and had started hanging out with a group of my fellow staffers at the campus newspaper. Our favorite activity was going to movies.  We got off to a bad start, making ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" our first choice.  Blech.We saw a couple more films that were good, but nothing to write home to Mom about.  However, one night, my friend Jay called me and asked if there was a movie that I particularly wanted to see.  I said no, but that ""Knight's Tale"" movie looked interesting.  Little did I know how significant that offhand decision would be.Right from the start, I knew this was a special movie.  The witty banter between Roland and William as they try to figure out what to do about the late Sir Ector.  Then, throwing the feisty Wat into the mix, it got better.WAT:  What do you mean, dead? ROLAND:  The spark of his life is smothered in shite.Then, Wat kicking and pummeling the armored body was a clear indication that this was something different.  I had heard about the anachronisms in the soundtrack, but there was something oddly rousing about Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" at the first stadium scene.From there, the movie got better and better, climaxing with one of the most satisfying movie kisses in years.  In ""The Princess Bride,"" Peter Falk makes reference to the final kiss between Westley and Buttercup as being the one that ""blew away"" the top five most passionate kisses of all time.  I'd argue that Will and Jocelyn challenged them.That movie solidified the friendship between myself, Jay, and our friend Jessica, and the three of us became inseparable.  We still are, a year and a lot of hardships later.I own the film on DVD, have the CD for both soundtrack and score, and find myself quoting it more times than I care to count.  ""A Knight's Tale"" was, by far, the most significant film of 2001 for me, and I was thrilled to see it up for three MTV Movie Awards.  It's a shame it was too ""low-brow"" for the Oscars, because I think that Doc Powell's ""Pieces"" could have taken Best Original Song.Anyway, that's just my ultra-biased impression.  For the record, Laura Fraser is RIDICULOUSLY gorgeous, and my one knock on the film was that her part was relatively small.Oh, well.  I'm just picking now.",A Knight's Tale

But director/writer/producer Brian Helgeland never does anything positive with the anachronisms in his picture.  It's just an excuse to be sloppy.  The hero's noble lady comes to his tent at night alone, as if medieval ladies ever went anywhere alone.  She offers to run away with him and be poor, as if that was a real option in the days when the poor were really starving.  The movie misses every conceivable dramatic opportunity.  A ""peasant squire"" becomes a fake knight with the help of his friends.  Where's the scene where he gets all high and mighty with them because now he's Sir Ulric?  Where's the scene where his beloved gets mad at him, not because he's not really noble, but because he's lied to him?  Nothing ever goes particularly bad for him, so it's hard to get worked up about anything.I hope this movie does well because I like to see medieval movies.

196,Cathz,Not recommended for people who appreciate good movies.,2,30 March 2002,"I had been anticipating seeing this film as soon as it came out to rent, and I cannot begin to describe my intense feeling of disappointment even seconds after it had began.I am a regular movie-lover and I do not often completely bash films or claim them to be worthless, but I really can't think of anything to praise about this film.  My initial reaction was (as is so often the case nowadays) that there is absolutely nothing new here, in fact it is simply a convoluted mixture of old cinema recipes flung together in an undignified heap.  There were a couple of scenes which seemed to be carbon-copies from 'Gladiator' - particularly inside the dungeon towards the end (anyone remember Commodus thrusting the knife into Maximus before the last fight?)  There was also a bit of 'Shakespeare In Love' in there (soppy love poem anyone?) and also echoes of 'Excalibur' of course.  What these other films have though are excellent scripts, something which 'A Knight's Tale' most certainly does not.The acting astonished me, it was so remarkably bad.  Not so much Heath Ledger himself, who although bland was at least watchable.  But who the hell are Shannyn Sossamon and Alan Tudyk??  In my opinion, they ruined this movie.  If the directors were so short of actors for these main roles, they could easily have found two 14-year-old British kids with absolutely no acting experience, and would still have produced better performances.  It is a sad thing to see such talent as Laura Fraser, Paul Bettany, and particularly Rufus Sewell and James Purefoy, go to waste and be part of such a farce as this.  'A Knight's Tale' is one credit on their filmography which I think should be forgotten and forgiven.In short, this film has been weighed, it has been measured, and it most certainly has been found wanting!! 2/10 (one star for Rufus, one for James, and that's generous!)",A Knight's Tale

This movie had some wonderful moments, such as the joust scenes and the moments with the ""Black Prince"". However, I couldn't fully enjoy this movie. I would get lost in the historical moments, then my stomach would be wrenched out when there were any anachronisms and there were many. The historian in me cringed when there was modern rock music played and acknowleged by the characters in the movie. I was looking forward to some nice medieval and pastoral music. I also cringed at the outfits worn by the princess. They were obvious 1980's style clothing and hair. Not at all becoming, besides being historically inaccurate. I don't mean to be a downer, but if you're a true historian, this movies hits you in the gut quite a few times after you get into the good parts. Plus, from the romantic standpoint, I really think the knight ended up with the wrong and fickle girl. I will concede, that every director has his own interpretations and it seems that the public liked this film, so to each his own. Overall, I give this movie about 5-6 starts.",A Knight's Tale

201,Kaippally,A bad interpretation of the medieval sport of Jousting.,3,25 March 2002,"This is a below the average production set in Medieval England about a young man who impersonates a nobleman/Knight in order to participate in a Jousting tournaments. It is funny in some scenes, but nothing to throw you off your seat. The film fails to capture the atmosphere of period in which the story is set. You do get a feeling that the whole movie is just a few Americans dressed up as knights and lords. The story is rather simple in its progression there are few distractions from the main theme and does capture the audiences interest throughout the film. The main theme being the competitiveness of the sport although without getting into the details or the spirit of jousting. The Acting can only be described as satisfactory since the script doesn't have room for any powerful moments. The cast of this film is best suited for a teen flick not a period film. Some of the attempts at English accents are simply unbearable. The father son relation ship was built up rather well. there are some good performances by Christopher Cazenove, who place the part of Williams father. The letter writing scene was done rather well and was different from the rest of film. It almost seems as if this was done by a different director.
During the course of this film I noticed The music switching between rock music to 15th century  traditional folk music.  The use of contemporary music did not add any entertainment value to this film.
I would recommend it to a younger audience who is not looking forward to seeing a good bit of action or history. Rating: 3/10.",A Knight's Tale

204,suzy-60,Good movie!,7,5 April 2007,"A Knight's Tale sets out to make a story about life in the Middle Ages which interprets everything to make it accessible to the modern teen (almost a sports movie, with jousting as the sport). And this it does fabulously, rescuing an aspect of medieval life that's far too often overlooked: its youthfulness, wit, invention, and courage. This is summed up in the character of Chaucer--deliriously played by Paul Bettany--who is young, brash, brilliant, and downright wacky, like so many of the youthful writers and thinkers of the time.Thus the movie, though not true to the letter of its setting, is certainly true to its spirit. A few modernisms did fall flat in the older setting, such as one character calling another ""a foxy lady""--a joke so terrible I'm almost glad that I saw it coming three miles away and had plenty of time to duck--or the treatment of the Church, which in those days was anything but grey, dreary, and irrelevant. A love scene seems out of place, the flashbacks are almost maudlin, Lady Jocelyn's character is downright irritating, and Howard Pyle should sue over copyright, for the plot is half lifted from Men of Iron. Apart from that, this is a fascinating look at the ""Middle"" Ages and lots of fun to watch.",A Knight's Tale

The story is predictable but who doesn't want to see Rufus Sewell get beat by the end of this film.",A Knight's Tale
207,venkat_rs,A good ride...,6,25 October 2001,"Hollywood has looked upto British history often, probably since American history by itself is relatively short. This movie is a fictional account of the medieval times when knights were revered even in other parts of Europe.The story is fairly straightforward, dealing with a commoner who aspires to be a knight. In spite of the regular emotional and love angles, this movie stands out since it packs a heavy dose of humour. For a sample, how do you fancy people of those times singing and dancing to contemporary pop music?Ledger (The Patriot) plays his role with ease while Sossamon just serves the romantic purpose. Sewell is probably a good villain prospect.As an audience, we get to relive those interesting times, particularly the thrilling sport of jousting, in two hours of good fun (though crude occasionally). One is reminded of Evolution, which also took the lighter route. Anyway, hats off to the writer / director for the different approach!",A Knight's Tale
208,Chandler_,A Wrong Tale,3,4 August 2002,"This is a story about a boy who wants to become anactor. His name? Heath Ledger. Will he succeed at it? Hopefully? What will it depend on? His choice of movies. Is it working out? Probably. But I must say, good old Heath, you only have made one good movie from your beginning till A Knight's Tale. The movie called Two Hands. Correction: one great movie called Two Hands.But what about A Knight's Tale?I must admit, the movie starts off very well, the music is set right with We Will Rock You from Queen! And it almost started of as a satire.
But then, when you least expect it, it crawls upon you and chokes you! The writers suddenly get involved in writing allot of clichés. So many I couldn't count them. What happened with the great premises?They got shattered between the battles of the knights.  After the first battle the dialogues get more and more ridicule by the minute. Off course the writers had to put in a love story for the couples in the theater, and a funny guy (I mean two funny guy's) for the lonesome guys who can identify there selves with them. Does it work? Not in this century. I must agree when they say that the battle's were done nicely but after a while even those get boring.
Everything you see in this film has been done before, only much better. The villain who must defeat the hero, the defeat of the hero and trying to get the girl. And don't forget the great comeback of the hero and the great love story between the hero and the girl.Everything was done exactly by the book. But did it all work?I saw the romantic past in your eyes I planned to surprise and surprised I was when I woke up crying",A Knight's Tale
209,shiningmonk,A boy's film for all the family,10,5 September 2004,"The title (based on the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, who is one of the main characters) relates to William, a humble English squire who dons his dead lord's armour to compete in French jousting competitions, aided by his two squire friends, herald Chaucer and Scottish fletcher-ette (!).Some suspension of belief is called for in the confusion about what a bunch of English (and Scottish!) people are doing in France when the countries should have been at war or at least on poor terms, the meaning of 'knights', the crowd scenes, which are more reminiscent of a football match (well, Sir William bears more than a passing resemblance to David Beckham) and the rock music score.(The opening scene with the crowd thumping away to Queen's ""We Will Rock You"", is particularly good.)Nevertheless, this fast-moving adventure has everything it takes for 2 hours 10 minutes of enjoyment. The hero is dashing, the heroine is sumptuously beautiful (well, she is half-French!), the sidekicks are loyal and amusing, and the villain contemptuous, eerie and vile. The scenes with Sir William's father were also touching.There is a tiny bit of minor swearing and some male nudity (back only, so nothing to worry about, mum). Also, the violence is not gory, as one might expect from a film about combat as a sport.Excellent!!",A Knight's Tale
210,ntanu,A Man can change his stars,7,4 July 2020,I have always liked this film. It's fun and entertaining and inspiring. I wish some of the sword scenes we're better to be honest. It just seemed basic other than that it was well done.,A Knight's Tale
211,amoore-2,Best film of 2001,10,1 September 2001,"The summer of 2001 has been pretty devoid of any decent blockbusters and I was starting to despair of seeing anything reasonable. Until A Knights Tale came along.It's a simple story of local boy makes good that is carried well by all the actors. It is glib, cheeky and humorous. The jousting scenes look excellent and the soundtrack rocks! I was kinda reminded of Plunkett and McLean.",A Knight's Tale

in conclusion it was a fun and touching movie about a man who changed his life for the better, got the girl, got the glory etc. the acting was pretty good but pacing a bit all over the place.",A Knight's Tale
213,orthogonal6,Just Accept it and Enjoy It,7,24 January 2008,"There is virtually no reason this movie should work. The film's creators must have been out of their minds. Let's take a movie about medieval jousting, load it up with characters singing and dancing to modern music, throw in lots of other anachronisms, dollop on liberal amounts of humor and comic relief, give it an underlying serious story, and see if folks take it seriously. In other words, let's see if they get it. Get what, exactly? Mainly that this movie does not take itself too seriously. It's entertainment. If you want historical accuracy or grand drama, look elsewhere. Watching A Knight's Tale means suspending disbelief and just accepting it for what is. And it is entertaining, in large part because the director sets the right tone by bringing in the right actors. Heath Ledger does a good job in his role, but it is his entourage that really puts the solid foundation in there, particularly Paul Bettany's Chaucer. William's love interest did not particularly convince me (I was thinking ""Dude, have you looked at her servant girl. Heck, forget them both and have at it with Kate""), but the overall story compensates for that. And the real story is William's efforts to change his stars. I liked this movie. No apologies. It is what it is, and I get that. Special note  came to look at this film in response to the death of Heath Ledger. Not a big fan one way or another, but it is certainly sad for anyone to be gone at such a young age.",A Knight's Tale
214,LinksPopcornPicks,"Not Great Per Se, but Still Fun",8,8 August 2008,"The movie is about a guy named William Thatcher (Heath Ledger) who with the help of his buddies ""changes his stars"". In other words William, who is a peasant becomes a knight. Being stuck in a low social class this is unacceptable. But with courage and heart anything is possible! not to mention the phony document that claims that William is in the correct social class to be a knight... -I'm sitting there as my mother is complaining about tonight's movie selection. ""Ugghh...this look's so terrible, it's only a matter of time before Adam Sandler shows up"". Soon enough ""Queen"" starts and my mother stops her rant. The first half of the film, entertaining as is be is fine and all, but is not nearly as good as the second half. The first half has some good humor, music, and action, but it's not until the halfway through the film that I invest a good chunk of my feelings in the characters, just feels a little heartless. The second half delves a little bit into both William's love interest story and also his past. This improves the story, because you know why he has the desire and motivation to be a knight. The other characters are funny and likable as you get to know them. You admire them for their loyalty and friendship to William. -The other thing thats fun about this movie is the music. The film contains classic songs from ""AC DC"", ""Queen"", amongst other classic rock bands. These songs give the film a special tone and energy. It makes the movie feel like a classic story with a modern attitude. -Overall I really liked ""A Knight's Tale"". If you haven't already seen it and like films such as ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Stardust"" then this is the movie for you. Its not a classic or anything, but has a strange ratio of humor, action/adventure, and drama that makes for a good film. Definitely pick it up, I might even go as far as recommending to buy it on DVD. B",A Knight's Tale

But hey, what the heck!",9,4 January 2006,"********* This May Contain Some Spoilers**************** The first 5 minutes of the movie were a little bit of a turn off for me. I also got a little confused when I heard the infamous STOMP STOMP CLAP of Queen's "" We Will Rock You"", but then Iactually started to really enjoy it. Everyone gives great performances in the movie, and the fighting and jousting scenes are spectacular. I'm not really a Heath Ledger fan, but he did do exceptionally well in this movie. Plus I also love the scenery and the costumes. The climatic battle at the end of the movie between Heath Ledger and Rufus Sewell will have you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails.

Give credit to Brian Helgeland, I went to see this based on the fact that he wrote LA Confidential, and if you are expecting that kind of writing, well, I apologize-though Helgeland does put his balls on the line for this one...Unfortunately it just doesn't pay off.  The acting is uniformly bad from everyone except Paul Bettany-not only is he the only decent actor, he also has the pleasure of avoiding all the stupid cliches that are set up throughout the film. Overall this movie isn't as bad as it could be-it actually could've been a lot worse-but it isn't very good either.",A Knight's Tale
217,OzoFriendly,Wonderful Entertainment!,8,19 August 2002,"I'd overlooked this film at the cinemas, largely because the trailers were all aimed squarely and rather too accurately at a teen audience, of which I may consider myself - sadly - long excluded from. Neither was I likely to be seduced by what seemed to me to be another horrible re-write of european history by an American screenwriter bent on portraying the world in its own lugubrious, self-glorifying image.Brian Helgeland, fortunately, cannot be described as the typical American screenwriter. Discounting the somewhat dismal 'The Postman', which he co-wrote in any case, Helgeland has proved himself equal to accomplished and entertaining screenplays in 'Payback', 'Conspiracy Theory and his adaptation of the Ellroy classic, 'LA Confidential'.So I finally get around to watching 'A Knight's Tale'. What a treat! Although it runs a little longer than it should for the genre, every scene is satisfying. Evocative of the lurid colours of every medieval romp from the 50's MGM stable, but brought cleverly up to date by carefully placed anachronism, this is a superb family film. The story is a kind of 'Ivanhoe' meets 'Working Girl' adventure-romance and whilst inevitably formulaic, never fails to tickle the right buttons.The screenplay is handled comfortably and without the slightest campness that its predecessors revelled in, by a great cast of highly watchable actors. I couldn't say who I thought was the best, because everyone was right for their role. But without a doubt, the best lines got the best treatment in the hands of a dastardly Rufus Sewell, a flamboyant Paul Bettany and a volcanic Alan Tudyk. Heath Ledger, (who I loved in 'Monster's Ball' and the undervalued 'Two Hands'), was the perfect gentleman and Shannyn Sossamon, the perfectly formed lady.I could recommend this film just on the strength of the story and the characterisation, but that would be to neglect the great editing, photography and - though subtle - the excellent special effects.A suspension of disbelief isn't required for this film, just like it wasn't required for 'Moulin Rouge'. Authenticity is only used to set the scene. The rest is just contemporary and hugely entertaining fantasy, from the costumes, to the music and dance.I give an 8. Go on treat yourself.",A Knight's Tale

Beginning with spectators at a tournament rocking to Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" this movie becomes a comedy that is perfect for Saturday evening viewing with the kids.

219,Iok,Makes Braveheart Look Historically Accurate,9,15 November 2002,"I first saw ""A Knight's Tale"" by chance.  A few of us had decided on an ad hoc visit to the local cinema and selected ""A Knight's Tale"" simply because it sounded the least ""teen"" movie on the bill.  We slapped down our cash and took our seats.The movie began...A crowd of peasants are assembled to watch the jousting.  And they're singing ""We Will Rock You.""My initial response was ""God, this is going to be bad.""But as the movie continued, it suddenly dawned on me - I wasn't hating the movie at all!  On an intellectual level, I should have been booing and throwing stuff at the screen but there's something about the sheer verve and energy of ""A Knight's Tale"" that just drags you in on an emotional level.
A clever script with many modern references, a good cast of likeable characters and a fantastic soundtrack (the reveal of ""Golden Years"" is particularly good) all add up to make ""A Knight's Tale"" one of the most entertaining mainstream movies I've seen in a long time.Normally I hate ""popcorn"" movies - not because I consider them ""low brow"" or an insult to the intelligence, but because they're shallow, tired and lack soul.  Yet ""A Knight's Tale"" is different.  No, it won't change your life and it won't make you ponder your place in the universe.  But it will entertain you.If you're looking for an ""old fashioned"" good vs. evil movie with a twist, or your copy of ""The Princess Bride"" is wearing thin, check out ""A Knight's Tale.""8/10",A Knight's Tale

I have watched this over 200 times ( no lie) and I never get bored! it is just go good! i love the actors, and the directing in this film. Heath Ledger is very believable as William Thatcher, and Shannon Sossamon has a fair entry into the film industry. The plot is very well constructed (with a few holes) but other than that I think that this is in my top 5 favorite movies. There is no arguing that you will fall in love with Ledgers character, and that you will hate Sewell's. Brian helgeland does a great job on the jousting sequences, making them look real and so you fear for the character. And the suspense of Adhemar's plot against Ulrich is an added bonus. Parts of this movie blow me away, like when he fights in the sword ring and when he is training with Roland and Wat. All in all this movie is insanely good, and is so good I have to make up a new word. Fantasmagorical",A Knight's Tale

My god sometimes when i miss a movie i very much wanted to see there must be a good reason behind it and sure enough there was!I have never been so bored in all my life , here i was thinking this was going to be somewhat like Braveheart and it was more like an extended version of a Walt Disney animated feature.  I thought when the beginning started into Queen's ultimate classic ""We will rock you"" that this was going to be everything i thought it was, boy was i let down.Don't get me wrong i like Heath Ledger (mainly because my favorite actor is one of his mentors, that being Mel Gibson,I also enjoyed heath in ""Ten things i hate about you"" I just didnt like him in this im hoping to see more of Heath however but it would be nice in a more modern scenerio!Well to make a long story short if you like jousting and all the activities envolved with medieval times you will probably like this!Me myself was disappointed.

This was the worst movie--in  preview--I'd seen in a long tome even with the caveat that 12 minutes would be cut. To open with the cast singing ""We Will Rock You"" is a weird convention that makes little sense;  to abandon that convention makes less sense. There is no internal reality here. OK, I imagine Chaucer has lost his boxer shorts--I'm not kidding--in a later cut. But I doubt they lost the sexy little blacksmith--a petite and gorgeous woman (aren't all blacksmiths). In this mess was a good movie about jousting that the filmmakers seemed to have no faith in whatsoever. Maybe if the Monty Python crew could have the negatives and final cut, this could be saved.

If you can tolerate things that just don't seem to fit in this movie about jousting knights, then you may not walk out of this movie like my sister did. The strongest aspects of a Knight's Tale, starring Heath Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon, are witnessing the first-hand excitement of a medieval jousting competition and the attractiveness of its actors.The film likens jousting to a modern-day contact sport. Athletes tour old Europe to compete in front of dedicated fans, and play with severe injuries just like today's NFL superstars. The joust is by far this movie's greatest attribute, but the extreme cheesiness and juxtaposed soundtrack prevent me from giving this movie any more than a B-.",A Knight's Tale
226,Miroslav-A,Best commercial for Nike 🙂,8,10 July 2021,"Although the legendary H. Ledger is in the lead role, it's actually Paul Bettany who has caught my attention with theatrical monologues in this title. In a supporting role, though, but he won an award for it. Guaranteed he enjoyed the role of spokesman himself.Certainly not the first, nor the best role in the relatively short career of a talented Ledger. But interestingly and convincingly, he played the character of Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein. It's actually William - an ordinary peasant with a desire to become something more. So he changes his name, falsifies his origins so that as a nobleman he could participate in a knighthood contest.The entire cast actually contributed to goal where cliché in the script fell into a second plan, and the characters brought our attention instead.Excellent elements of romance were helped by the lovable S. Sossamon (in hers debut role), while the action alongside Ledger was complemented by the brilliant Rufus Sewell as the inevitable rival to the protagonist, in the role of knight of the villain.There are also elements of the parody, starting with the opening scene that begins with the number 'We Will Rock You'. Then the 'Nike' logo engraved on the armor; I thought for a moment that I had a bad view, I had to bring the scene back 😁.Several touching scenes are also beautifully blended in. I would single out the return of Sir Ulrich/William to his native country, where after so many years (now as a famous knight) he has reunited with his blind father...As a final judgment, I'd compare it to Mr. Ritchy's 'King Arthur'. Who liked that title, this one will also entertain him. And who expected the Brave Heart script, the criticism will be overwhelming.For more movie reviews, visit my blog :

228,gwynjones2001,Standing the test of Time,10,5 March 2011,"I just watched this on HBO HD, 10 years after it was released in cinemas, and I was moved to comment. I watched this when it first came out, and I enjoyed it then. But 10 years later, watching it again, I was really struck by how enjoyable and engaging it is. Over 2 hours of solid entertainment, it didn't drag for one minute.In particular, it has an added poignancy as it features Heath Ledger's first lead role. Later, Heath Ledger would have some outstanding roles in Brokeback Mountain (for which he was nominated for an Oscar) and The Dark Knight (for which I think he won an Oscar). Of course, his later performances were more assured and more powerful, and deserving of the acclaim. But here in A Knight's Tale, he carries the film, and shows the potential he went on to fulfil. And, to my mind, while I enjoyed both Brokeback and Dark Knight, the former is controversial in its subject matter, and the latter is rather dark and violent. For a family-friendly demonstration of Heath Ledger's greatness, and the sadness of his untimely death, I really think you should look no further than A Knight's Tale.But it wasn't just Heath Ledger who did well in an early role. Particular praise has to go to Paul Bettany for a standout early performance as Chaucer. From the time they meet him, naked on the road, Chaucer is very funny, and a core part of the movie as the principal supporting actor.However, this is an ensemble cast, with Heath Ledger's team supporting him and inspiring him, and he, in turn, earning their loyalty, respect, and love. We have Chaucer, as mentioned, together with Wat and Roland, who both have funny and touching moments. We also have a feisty lady blacksmith Kate, who's also great, and has some nice moments like her early trademark.The love interest, Shannyn Sossamon, is beautiful, and amusing as a medieval proto-feminist, Jocelyn. Her maid is cute too (as is the blacksmith), so there is plenty of eye candy on display. I personally think Sossamon does a good job, and there are some nice moments between her and Ledger.Then we have two fine actors with smaller, but pivotal roles, James Purefoy as the Prince of Wales, who jousts (incognito) with, and later saves, Heath Ledger. And Rufus Sewell, who does a great job as Count Adhemar, the high-achieving, but villainous, tournament champion, who we boo enthusiastically.And we have veteran actor Christopher Cazenove, squeezing out an emotional performance as Ledger's father, a blind thatcher.As others have said, the story is not new, and it's entirely predictable. But it doesn't seem any the worse for it. And, in the process, it includes several story threads, including triumph over adversity, finding true love, reuniting with family... while throwing in some extras like the value of loyalty, that one good turns deserves another, and that if you try hard enough, you can achieve your dreams. And that the bad guy will finish flat on his back, just as he should.As it's a ""knight's tale"", it's medieval. But not as we know it. It's totally anachronistic, with modern music, dancing, clothing, feisty feminists, and contemporary manner of speech. Many criticize this, but I think it's one of the best aspects of the movie, and it's very cleverly done, not accidental. Personally, I love the way it includes modern sports and dance conventions within an older setting, it makes the movie more accessible, and most of the time it's very funny. It's hard to pick specific examples, but early on the crowd starts doing Queen's We Will Rock You at a jousting tournament. And later, at the Winners' Ball, Ledger's old country dance morphs into David Bowie's Golden Years. Both are excellently done, and help you understand the action better, rather than detracting something by not being of the era.At it's core, it's a pretty decent movie. And the supporting cast does a good job, so that gives it bonus points. I personally love the anachronistic style, it adds a lot of humor and insight to the movie. But it's definitely not to everyone's taste. Finally, you have two actors, before they were famous, delivering great performances. It's the presence of Bettany, and, Ledger, in particular, which elevates this movie to greatness.It's like Top Gun, but with horses and lances, instead of jets. And Heath Ledger instead of Tom Cruise.",A Knight's Tale
229,johnedit,Fun.,7,11 May 2001,"When it works, this is a clever mix of medieval jousting and modern sensibilities.

But having said that, I realize this movie is not about the Middle Ages in Europe, but rather is set in some alternate universe, where modern rock music (as well as speech, mannerisms, and parts of society) have somehow been transplanted onto a more ancient culture. Having started with that disclaimer, I must admit I liked it. There were some large plot holes, and some of the acting was weak (Shannyn Sossamon), but it was a good two hour escape from reality. Bottom line, get yourself a drink and a big bag of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the fantasy. (And never, ever look for a history lesson!)",A Knight's Tale
231,Jake-60,A Good Knight? More like a Knightmare!,4,23 September 2001,"Some people will love this film. They will see it as a sports movie, like Rocky, or The Mighty Ducks, or Remember the Titans.  Gorgeous babes (of both sexes), violence, action, romance, nudity, rock music, horses running in slow motion and people with poo on them.  Sounds to me like the perfect Blockbuster. But the entire film just didn't do it for me.(Spoiler Alert!!!!!) I've got this picture in my head, see.  The movie is called a Knight's Tale, not a Cowboy's Tale, or a Struggling boxer from the wrong side of the tracks' Tale.  Knights behave in a certain way, and that's what I went to see.  You don't rent Dirty Harry for its dance numbers, or watch Police Academy for insights  into existentialism. Some genres are about certain things, and Medieval Action/Romance is about knights.  A knight is noble, believes in honour and is motivated to do great deeds because he is inspired by God, or his true love or the quest for truth, justice and the Arthurian way.  Heath Ledger's Mark Thatcher is just a spoilt brat.  He wants to be famous.  That's his most heroic quality. Let's check out his other heroic qualities and what they tell us about knights. When his friends finally get the money to go home after years overseas, he refuses to let them and spends their money on setting himself up as a knight. (lesson- a knight doesn't give a toss what anyone else thinks.) When caught breaking all the rules, instead of running, as everyone he loves suggests, Thatcher yells ""I will not run"" and gets arrested and beat up. (lesson- Knights are morons and still don't give a toss what anyone thinks.) I could go on. I just couldn't like him.  Just like  Leonardo in Titanic,  I hated the character.  Wouldn't want to know him and wouldn't speak to him if I did. Stuck up, self-centred, dishonest and stubborn,  good qualities when your hero is James Bond, but not when he's a Knight. The jousting was supposed to be spectacular, but really, there's only so many times you can watch two horses run at each other before the novelty wears off.  One time, to be precise. And the anachronisms and historical inaccuracies.  I could just about deal with a naked Geoffrey Chaucer (whom every one calls Jeff), and peasant crowds doing the wave and chanting ""We will rock you"", but face painting, and dancing straight out of a Madonna video was too much for me.  And when ""Jeff"" stands on the arm of the Prince of Wales' chair to announce  the latest joust, and receives a round of applause instead of an arrow through the throat,  it was the closest I've come to walking out of a film since I found out ""Blow"" wasn't a porn movie. A waste of time and money",A Knight's Tale
232,Blou,Nothing to Rave About,1,3 September 2001,"At the request of a friend, I went to see A Knights Tale not expecting a cinematic masterpiece. So as I sat through the 131minute long film, I was not disappointed with my expectations. The film involves a young man  William (Heath Ledger from The Patriot and 10 Things I Hate About You)who has a dream to play in the jousting competitions that take place all over Europe during medieval times. He cannot compete unless he is of noble birth (his father was a roof maker...hence his last name, Willaim Thatcher) so he poses as a far off man under the name of Ulrich von Lichtenstein. He does this with the help of Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) and his two friends Roland (Mark Addy from The Full Monty) and Wat (Alan Tudyk). Attending at many of these joustin competitions is the beautiful Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) whom Williams falls for. She is a rich, young, beautiful noble and he is a poor ragamuffin. We've heard it all before.The scenery and cinematography are impressive and the camera work during the jousting scenes are equally so. On the other hand, I found the acting, storyline and humour to be cliched, cheesy and amateurish. There are shining moments (when Wat returns from delivering the letter to Jocelyn and gives William a kiss from her)but the flashbacks of Williams, the shoddy extras performances and the cheesy storyline all add up in the end. Things that aren't supposed to seem funny are laughable, such as the dancing sequences and Jocelyns attire. Jocelyns clothes were disastrous, and she looks completly out of place in a medieval setting. Yes, she was supposed to stand out, but no, she wasn't in a 'Queen of Naboo Look A Like Competition', which this reviewer believes was the objective of the costume people.A cute film if you like cheesy romance and bad jokes. Heath Ledger usually puts in a great performance, but I don't think even De Niro or Brando could of saved this piece. Kuto's though to Paul Bettany (William Chaucer)....he made the film bearable....just.**/*****",A Knight's Tale
233,olof.dellien-2,Must-see if you like the genre,8,11 November 2001,"There is only one problem with the movie, and it is that it is a bit long, which takes off a bit from the pace. Otherwise, it is an excellent knights tale in the spirit of films like Ivanhoe, Robin Hood (not the one with Kevin Costner of course!). Some people complain about lack of historical accuracy, but it certainly does not lag behind films like the Patriot or the above-mentioned Robin Hood - the difference is that this movie as opposed to ""the Patriot"" does not claim historical accuracy. It is a tale - and very well told.",A Knight's Tale
234,annabrownie,So it's anachronistic...who cares??,9,9 July 2008,"I have actually lost count of how many times I have watched this movie. I bought it as soon as I could - and in fact still own it on VHS!! I have a degree in history, with medieval Britain and Europe my special interest, yet despite this film's historical inaccuracy, I still love it.The plot is not original, yet the film works because the cast are so vibrant, so obviously having fun, and they utterly inhabit their characters. The dialogue is hilarious and touching (sometimes simultaneously) and the rock music soundtrack works astonishingly well in this setting. Heath Ledger was the biggest name in this film when it came out, and he is a superb lead, but the rest of the cast are also excellent. Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk provide wonderful and absolutely hilarious support as the closest friends of Ledger's character, William Thatcher, a peasant boy who seizes an unlikely chance to ""change his stars"" and become a knight. Laura Fraser is likewise great as the blacksmith who joins their little band after fixing William's armour. Rufus Sewell is a very good villain, suitably posturing and nasty, and although you don't loathe him entirely, his downfall is extremely satisfying. Shannyn Sossaman is perhaps the weakest of the leads but she is still a credible romantic interest. One of my favourite characters is Edward, the Black Prince, who has relatively little screen time (in fact, he appears in disguise for some of it) but who is nevertheless very well portrayed by James Purefoy. My favourite character, however, is Geoffrey Chaucer, played by Paul Bettany, of whom I am something of a fan, mainly due to this film. He is hilarious, clever and witty, and his speeches as he announces William at tournaments are amongst the finest moments in the film. This movie should not work, but Brian Helgeland has somehow managed to create a wonderful, enjoyable, funny film, with great action, brilliant characters and excellent dialogue. I never tire of watching it and hope I never will.",A Knight's Tale
235,Karl Aksel,"In hell, they run this movie every day",1,2 November 2001,"Clearly, you need to be in your wee teens to enjoy this movie.Ok, it's not the music or the historical accuracy I care about in this movie, and indeed, it claims no accuracy in either field. But that's rather the point, and an interesting idea, but sadly this is as original as it gets.Every character fits neatly into the classic Hollywood stereotypes; the unorthodox, handsome, honest, jovial, happy-go-lucky hero (and his companions) on the one side (Heath Ledger), and the conservative, thoroughly evil, treacherous, conniving antagonist (Rufus Sewell), who is ever plotting the hero's downfall, on the other. It's the classic cliché - the good guy is all good, and fights honourably; the bad guy is all bad, and fights dirty.And of course there has to be a woman between them, who naturally favours the good guy. This childish lovestory is completely uncalled for, and the moment our wannabe hero eyes Jocelyn (Shannon Sossamon), the rest of the movie becomes too predictable to bear. At this point, I started chewing on my ticket, as I sat there in the cinema(it seemed like the thing to do, under the circumstances).The clichés just kept mounting, and it took every ounce of my willpower to stay the duration of this movie. There wasn't a single element of surprise in the entire film, and this doomed the film from the very beginning. It's the American dream, isn't it (AKA your run-of-the-mill fairytale)? Here's the peasant hero, who becomes a knight and gets the princess. Of course, since his being a knight is a lie, this will have to be revealed (and of course it's the evil adversary who busts him), but wait! Here's Prince Edward to the rescue, because the hero was nice to him earlier. The peasant becomes a bona fide knight, and can finish the movie.
This movie COULD have been made good, if only the clichés had been avoided. The worst clichés are:I The love plot (it's identical with those in your average bed time story)II The stereotypes (even worse here than in 'Gladiator')III The father (can someone give me a good reason why HE should be dragged into this mess?)But worst of all, the most unforgivable element in the entire film...(SPOILER ALERT, I guess...) ...is when the hero, badly wounded, heroically jousts against his nemesis WITHOUT ARMOUR. This is the most nauseating, dishonourable and despicable thing I've ever seen. Was this scene supposed to arouse any other emotions than pure hatred?Sure, there were laughs, several hilarious moments, but not nearly enough to save this turkey.And I thought the lady blacksmith was far more attractive than that damnable princess anyway (if you have to have a love story, THAT's the way to go).My rating: 1/10, because that's as low as the scale goes.",A Knight's Tale

That is not what I received. I left unsatisfied at what I had just paid £ 5.25 to see.I don't think my expectations were especially high - just 2 hours of mindless fun.Instead I found A Knight's Tale boring, repetitive and downright silly. The jousting scenes - surely an integral part of the film - seemed like more of the same each time, and the supposed 'love' interest was about as interesting as a cardboard cutout.There are a few laughs to be had, and some of the in - jokes and references are amusing, but overall, this is unremarkable, and not a patch on the best blockbusters.4/10",A Knight's Tale

My little brother came home from school raving about it, and I was convinced that this would be just another dorky educational movie.  Ten minutes into the movie, I was hooked.  Not only is Heath Ledger incredibly gorgeous, he's very talented.  I was impressed with how successfully the cast and crew melted together the elements of realism and utter fantasy. The story line was fun and didn't jump all over the place, and the characters were lovable, and believable.  I actually felt Sir William's pain as he was informed that he had forfeited, and was to be arrested.  I felt his pain when he was ripped from his father, and sent to live with a strange man in a strange land far from home, and again I felt for him when he learned of his father's blindness.  Jocelyn was incredibly  beautiful and kind.  She had a strong will, and refused to succumb to any man.  Her love for Sir William was pure and unadulterated.  The ending was as it should have been, with love and justice prevailing.  I did love the music as well. It was interesting and spiced up the already wonderful movie.",A Knight's Tale

But then I realized they were done on purpose. The movie, though set in a period long past, was made to entertain a modern audience. That mix of modern with ancient is one of the things that makes this movie so fun.I appreciate the fact that this movie allowed men to be men. The main character wasn't in the least a wimp, although he was clueless when it came to women. (But isn't that a part of being a man?) My favorite character is Chaucer, with Roland coming in a close second. Or maybe they are both tied for first. Love Chaucer's wit, sarcasm, and the way he picks on Wat. Roland's loyalty to Will is endearing, and that alone makes him one of my favorites.I like the message at the end. Without giving away anything, let me just say that it encourages one to take a stand and stick by it, no matter the consequences.

Should I comment what was the coolest part of the movie, it must be how they used songs like ""We Will Rock You"" in a movie about knights. The movie somehow mixed the present time with the 14th century. And it was so  well done that I was sucked into the screen. It's very seldom that a movie manages to do this with me.

Do people complain about the Korngold score for 'Robin Hood' because it is anachronistic? No. But it is highly anachronistic - someone from the Middle Ages would be as likely to find 'Robin Hood' as unintelligible as 'We Will Rock You' - or possibly more so.I thought that the use of modern rock music and football chants to be inspired and funny; and I found the movie overall to be quite enjoyable.",A Knight's Tale

On the other hand, the rivalry between Adhemar and William was not terribly interesting to me.  I think it would've been better if the movie didn't scream ""villain!"" whenever Adhemar showed up.

Heath gives the biggest downer in his career - jeez, talk about evolving, going from this to Brokeback mountain - the peak of his talent. Alan Tudyk makes me want to inflict pain on HIM and Shannyn Sossamon might very well be the worst actress on this Earth. The only thing that made me want to continue watching was Paul Bettany's insanely disrespectful (and hilarious) portrayal of Chaucer, which I truly appreciated and loved. The dialog is silly, at best, and most of the time just awkward and stupid. The script is VEEEEEERY thin and with a too fast pacing, at the same time there is not enough happening, which is weird. The pace races, but nothing is told.* The mix of medieval and modern does NOT work, and I really can't see how anyone could think it does. Sossamons clothes and hair make me queasy and wreck the whole medieval scenery. The music is annoying the h*ll out of me in combo with the setting, and the dance scene might be one of the most embarrassing things I have ever witnessed on a screen.I very well understand that this is a movie made for teens - non complicated, flashy, cute guy, cute girl (although the blacksmith-chick is much cuter), yada yada. But it still wouldn't have to turn out THIS bad...I seldom give grades THIS low, but there really isn't anything good to be said.

The first and most obvious fault is that they tried to cover up some of the film's overall blandness by creating a modern tone to the medieval atmosphere, an effort which fell flat on its face. The characters dance to rock music and wear Nike logos on their armor in an attempt at humor that really makes the film look stupid. The rest of the film is a wry look at the directors take on medieval tilting, which was a rather brutal sport.

256,SpinalTapFan,Could've been more than it was,6,1 January 2008,"I think the underlying concept was to satirise 20th century sport, and relationship and class connotations, by applying them in the middle ages. Crowds baying for blood, supporting their heroes blindly, stereotyped arguments (the idea that the English become giddy on French ground, the insistence that Jesus was English). It certainly wasn't meant to be a realistic tale, which should have been obvious.Unfortunately, it doesn't totally succeed in anything it does. The fish-out-of-water genre has been done much better, as has the good-heart-wins-fair-maiden/poor-boy-gets-rich-girl melodrama. There is little or no story in the first hour, and little or no comedy after that. It's at least half an hour too long, and hokey in places. Swordfighting is too simple a game to create anything tactical or evolving - they could have been playing tic-tac-toe, for all the difference it made. He comes back from 2-0 down to win the final, simple as that. The acting is mostly mediocre, with too much focus on Heath Ledger's face. Paul Bettany is funny in places, but somehow too hammy.Ultimately, it's a perfectly adequate evening-filler, if you can get past the opening joke, but the idea of a medieval satire of modern values was under-exploited.

They are a purposeful choice of the film - this is less sophisticated than Mideval Europe for Dummies. The film makers weren't going into it with a pretense of historical accuracy and cannot be judged as if they were (the makers of ""Troy"" and ""King Arthur"", however, are fair game). But even when you leave yourself open to the anachronisms, the movie is still not good. The script is nothing to brag about at all. I don't even want to get into it's lameness here.A great cast is enough to make even the worst scripts into good movies. Unfortunately for ""A Knight's Tale"", it did not have such a cast. With the exception of Paul Bettany's Geoffrey Chauncer, there are no really inspired performances. Heath Ledger puts in a fine, but not great performance as the lead character William Thatcher. Shannyn Sossamyn's Lady Jocelyn is about as flat and uncharismatic as she could get. The scenes between William and his love interest, Jocelyn, are awkward and, frankly, kind of embarrassing. There is no chemistry at all between the two. Rufus Sewell's performance as the villain, Count Adhemar, is about as one dimensional as Shannyn's efforts. The secondary characters are not much more than props who deliver witty one-liners. In the end, Will's sidekicks become that older guy, that redhead with a bad temper, and the female blacksmith instead of three-dimensional characters in their own right.If you must see this, try to catch it on TV if possible.

The blending of ""golden oldies"" from the 70s and 80s gives this movie an extra humorous and endearing boost and bespeaks the writer's appreciable creativity and perception. Heath Ledger does a wonderful job as the lead character--especially being so young himself--and his sidekicks in the movie are just as likable . . . in fact, one finds himself rather attached.The director did a wonderful job focusing on small things that one would hardly had given thought to . . . which--at least for the visually-oriented--calls into play a deeper level of emotion that the movie would have been much amiss without. Such keen observations render intrigue and the director thus avoids the monotony and mediocrity of presenting the work superficially. Much of the sentiment and reflective thought of the movie is translated merely through a close-up, an unusual angle, or a slow-motion technique at just the right moment. It was a job well done and I was very impressed. The humor was never dull and was always appreciable--down to the last moments--and the movie boasts some very touching, moving moments before the final curtain draws.Paul Bettany was purely delightful as Geoffrey Chaucer and the film simply could not have done without the spontaneous, spiked humor of short-fused Watt, played outstandingly by Alan Tudyk. I was speechless upon learning that Tudyk is really a natural born and bred Texan who completely (and marvelously!) faked an English accent for the movie. He had me totally fooled and upon watching it, I thought they'd gotten the guy from ""deep in the heart of England.""The jousting scenes are intense and well done--if not a bit repetitious, but there is motive and reason behind each repetition so they are tolerated well and manage to keep the viewer engaged. In addition, there is wonderful chemistry among the actors and I suspect they all had a generally great time making the movie together. This translates throughout their production virtually automatically.Except for the nudity with Paul Bettany that we could have all done without and with the exception of the brief bed scene and a few choice words here or there, this makes an otherwise excellent family movie or great choice for a cozy night in front of the fireplace with a good flick.",A Knight's Tale

Highlights of the movie; Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer is absolutely wonderful.  Heath Ledger as William Thatcher is everything a Knight should be -- brave, gallant, charming, and makes decisions with honor at any cost. The group that make up William Thatcher's 'team' are perfectly cast with lots of great interaction between them.  The music is lots of fun.  And the end will warm your heart and make you cheer.Bonus scene:  Stay till the end of the credits have rolled.  My friend and I wanted to see where the movie was filmed, so we watched the credits till then end.  We were the last people to leave the theater, and suddenly, extra footage came on the screen.  It was a *hoot* ! !",A Knight's Tale
264,fiannor,loved the film,9,13 January 2005,"Yea my jaw dropped the first time I heard the modern music, (more so cause I caught the show the first time right before the dance and didn't like the song), but the first time they played one of the classics from mm my generation, I howled. I think had I known there was modern music in it I wouldn't have been shocked, at first. But I got past the initial shock and would have loved the flick anyway. Big Heath fan, and I thought the innerplay between his character and his friends was great. Loved the ""We'll see you in the list"" song.fiannor (david)",A Knight's Tale
265,mimlauff,what fun,9,28 May 2001,"I went to see this movie because of my 13 year old daughter who is quite taken (of course) with Heath Ledger, but ended up enjoying it immensely myself.  The music is a great addition after you get used to '80's music in a midevil setting.  A lot of stuff in the back ground that adds to the fun....my husband swears he saw them doing ""the wave"" at one of the tournaments.  I would have no problem seeing it a second time and that is rare for me.",A Knight's Tale

I had anticipated a silly, cinematically retarded vehicle for Heath Ledger, but it was, instead, a clever, smart, and funny movie. It had brains and was entertaining. And if you want to see Heath Ledger at his hottest, this is the film! But seriously, it was a great movie. Totally unrealistic, but absolutely charming, with its medieval setting and 70s music, ""A Knight's Tale"" is definitely a must-see!",A Knight's Tale

268,kaelnin-1,Better than expected...,9,11 May 2001,"This film was much better than what I thought it would be based upon early word that I had received about it. While it is true that the film makes liberal use of modern colloquelisms and its soundtrack does not quite fit the film, the overall movie experience was one of pure entertainment spurred on by good character acting and a fast pace. From a historical point of view, the film is less than desirable, but if you leave your brain at the door and go in for sheer entertainment value, then you will not be disappointed. It is a light-hearted romp of a film that never takes itself too seriously and will leave you cheering for more at the end.",A Knight's Tale

Indeed the movie is ridiculous, thin, predictable, and has little to do with historical facts... How can any of that work? And it truly doesn't. Jake-60 said ""You don't rent Dirty Harry for its dance numbers"" and how right he is.The way the characters demonstratively break a scene into a dance to David Bowie's Let's Dance - well it just takes the prize as the most horrid Rocky Horror Picture Show middle ages ballet I have only seen in the types of movies rated on ColdFusion.An embarrassment to all participants.",A Knight's Tale

Tastefully done, this medieval tale rocks..Literally! Twentieth Century music and fashion set in the 14th century, and it worked very well. The dance hall scene transformed by David Bowie's 'Golden Years' is one of my all time favorite movie scenes; you will love it! Heath Ledger plays a knight in wanting, who must overcome an evil count, a beautiful but frustrating maiden, and a ruthless code of social hierarchy. I found myself cheering for him on all three battlegrounds. This film is very fun to watch. Though I've seen it many times, I never fail to enjoy it.",A Knight's Tale
272,shaifalihere,"From funny scenes to witty dialogues, from grandeur to rock music, this movie has everything packed in two hours and eleven minutes.",9,8 July 2013,"A Knight's Tale (2001) is an adventurous comedy period movie about a jousting tournament in which only nobility can participate. Heath Ledger as William, a Thatcher's son from Cheapside decides to change his stars by becoming Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein and compete in the tournament. From funny scenes to witty dialogues, from grandeur to rock music, this movie has everything packed in two hours and eleven minutes. You'll find yourself laughing hard holding your stomach most of the time. Brilliant acting by Heath Ledger. Sir Ulrich would not fail to remind you of Brad Pitt as Achilles in Troy. The rivalry between Sir Ulrich and Count Adhemar, played by Rufus Sewell extends off the fields. But William proves to be unbeatable, unhorsing Adhemar and finally winning the tournament as well as Jocelyn's (Shannyn Sossamon) love. The love entangle between William and Jocelyn rounds off the rough corners, if any. William proves to the world what it takes to be a noble, and not merely a noble lineage. The concept of pride and nobility has been exploited very cleverly, with Jocelyn begging William to run from the police, for pride could be taken away, according to her. His insistence of not running, for he is a knight, urges the audience to ponder over the question and existence of nobility and the concept of noble lineage. He is arisen to 'Sir William Thatcher' in the end by the prince of England. The past of William Thatcher with scenes with his father John Thatcher, played by Christopher Cazenove are seamlessly strewed together. The setting of the country side-the long boots, weathered gowns, the winter chill, the fog with the funny business of the crowd have been captured in all its beauty. What could be easily noticed are the weird hair-dos of Shannyn. The movie ends with a farting competition between William's friends to decide whose round it would be.Paul Bettany plays a poor gambler in search of some clothe, shoe and food- and agrees to write patents of nobility for William. The introductions by him before the matches arouse the audience to cheer for the fake Sir Ulrich, and also the audience in the movie theatres. With the catchy phrase of singing aloud for Sir Ulrich in a betting against French jousters, ""He's quick, he's funny and makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!"" Here's my adaptation- ""He's gorgeous, he's adorable and makes me go 'oooh', Ledger!""Must Watch.",A Knight's Tale
273,emmatails,A hilarious classic which stands the test of time,9,26 February 2014,"Any historical purist needs to leave his brain at the door when viewing this film. Once you set aside the obvious anachronisms (all deliberate I hasten to add), you will be in for a roaring good time.The script is comedy gold with some of the best lines coming from Paul Bettany and Alan Tudyk. It also doesn't rely too much on visual gags, which is very refreshing. Even after a few viewings, the jokes are still funny.The soundtrack is a major factor in the film's success and really helps with the tone. The opening scene is iconic and still gets a chuckle after all these years.Yes, this film does suffer from a couple of action hero clichés, but the whole film is so entertaining that you can forgive the predictability.A must-see for any movie buff.",A Knight's Tale
274,Magic-7,fun chivalric fantasy,9,23 May 2001,"I expected to hate this movie -- I take chivalric literature fairly seriously and and most pseudomedieval movies (especially so-called chivalric stories like ""First Knight"") disgust me.  ""A Knight's Tale,"" however, was a very pleasant surprise.Most of those who dislike this movie will say they do so because of its lack of ""realism"" the music doesn't fit the era, they say, Chaucer looks more like a complete fool than the courtier we know he spent part of his life as, and Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) has hairstyles that would need mousse, gel and spray used all at once to make them stay. 
AKT, however, doesn't claim to be a documentary.  (It doesn't even take itself as seriously as the mistake-ridden Braveheart.) Instead, it tells a time-worn story with grand affection and great humor.  The history isn't all incorrect, either: Helgeland has made Chaucer and Edward the right ages; Edward's personality and armor accord with historical representations  and both men would have seen the life and death of the free companies during the Hundred Years War.  With some slips (a peasant as a squire, an unmarried woman with the freedom to wander tournament  grounds, or the use of the phrase ""on paper"" long before paper was in use in England), the anachronisms are not only conscious, they are celebrated.  They make the audience laugh, sing, stamp their feet and they generally bring enthusiasm for the movie to a whole segment of the population that would not otherwise enjoy it.
The true weakness of  this movie is not in the history, it is in the romance.  Jocelyn and William seem ill-suited as a couple, having nothing more than lust to keep them together.  This fault, however, is the result of the formulaic, traditional chivalric tale.  It won't interfere more than a little with the enjoyment of the hours  spent in the darkness of the theater.  The best advice I can give you is to suspend your disbelief and let A Knight's Tale remind you of all the traditional stories you once enjoyed or introduce you to a type of story you may never had the pleasure to know.",A Knight's Tale

The film successfully blended old and new which was quite refreshing, considering film is all about fantasy. The film also successfully blended genre's, action, romance, comedy, and family. It is definitely a film that is worth viewing by all audiences and will be very successful because of this. In the first 20 minutes people may be saying ""What the?""

It's amazing how lame this movie was and it only got worse as wave after wave of its sh**tyness slapped me in the face. Further into the movie, Thatcher (Heath Ledger) is told to teach the court a dance from his home country, i nearly started crying it was so bad.

My husband and I are in our mid to late 30's and we enjoy it with our 7 year old son and 14 year old daughter. It is a movie that we all love and is entertaining enough for us all without all the bad language or filth. This movie does not need it. It stands alone without it. Two thumbs WAY up!!!!!!!!!!

""A Knight's Tale"" is one of those movies which are supposed to entertain you and don't pretend to be realistic. Actually, it's just the entrance scene with the ""We will rock you"" track that tells you that the whole plot is the fiction, that there's more of the producer's fantasy than of the historical truth. I enjoyed these little parody elements scattered all along the movie, I encountered some moral lessons which didn't seem too lousy as it's often the case for the Hollywood. The only thing I didn't like was Jocelyn. First, it seems to me her face doesn't really fit the settings. Second, I didn't like her make-up and hairstyle works.

For me, the best part was that it never takes itself too seriously - don't worry, this is not one of those tedious ""epic"" films with too much self-importance for its own good (a la ""Joan of Arc"").

Though I'm a fan of Heath Ledger, I think this was his worst film he has ever done. First of all, lets start off with the directing...it was terrible!! the acting was horrible enough to make you puke, the story line didn't have heart in it, nor was it strong, and way TOO Original and cheesy. The love story is quite annoying. Secondly, the costumes were hideous and so cheap looking. The rock songs is a joke all right and what was with the lady blacksmith..yeah right!",A Knight's Tale

After hearing this movie will become a TV show, I thought ""Well, why not give it another go?"" Upon my second viewing, I fell in love with this film. The music didn't anger me, as it wasn't used much throughout the film except for the first half hour. The performances, especially Heath Ledger's, are spectacular, and make you care for these characters.The story is a typical ""zero to hero"" tale, but it's told in a refreshing way. The props, armor, sets, etc. are all marvelously created, and really bring in a feel of authenticity that'll make you forget the modern music sprinkled throughout. The jousting scenes are very well done, and I almost teared up at William and his father's reunion.This movie is not meant to be a serious take on medieval times, as I wanted it to at first.

The movie was not trying to be a serious drama. It was, again, very entertaining and a movie one could watch over and over. I must say, some parts were slightly hokey, but I suppose when one is making that type of movie that is unavoidable.

One thing she hates even more so than fiction is the medieval era. She normally watches biography films or films loosely based off of true events. I finally got her to agree to watch this movie with me. Now, I know A Knight's Tale isn't strictly fiction, it has some accurate information. The director at least tried to make it accurate but entertaining at the same time, it is a movie after all.  Having said that, I would still classify this movie as a fairy tale, and there is nothing wrong with that. Normally my mother would instantly cry no, pleading, ""This will be a waste of time"". Nonetheless, we watched it together and her reaction was one of excitement and wonder. She expressed, ""Never in a million years I thought I would have liked that"".

Period pieces can be very distancing, because the people in them seem to come from such alien cultures. By including rock music and modern dancing, and even what looked to be 80's style hair and makeup, the film succeeds in getting across the point that these were young people taking part in what was a popular sport of the time, not just some strange, obscure medieval pastime. I got a real kick out of the film, and was impressed by the skills of the supporting actors.

295,jmott,An ultimately disappointing bit of fun,5,2 May 2001,"A Knight's Tale is at its strongest in the first half with the irreverent humor and jousting to Queen's ""We Will Rock You.""  It was exciting and different... until the movie started to take itself seriously.Paul Bettany steals the show as Jeff Chaucer within the merry band that accompanies Heath Ledger, the low-born peasant who would be knight.  His onscreen love-interest is equally wooden (Jocelyn, played by Shannon Sossamon), and I had to keep myself from cringing in their scenes together.While Helgeland scores a coup for the most part in his directing with hoof-pounding jousts and great production value, nice integration of CGI and tight pacing of scenes, he fails miserably with the script.  (He wrote and directed this one.)The big decision at the beginning of the film seems rushed and unsupported, like many decisions, large and small, made by the characters throughout the film.  You can almost see the man pulling levers behind the curtain, to mix movie metaphors.  The supporting cast remains woefully underdeveloped, especially the female armorer played by Laura Fraser, who was so good in Titus.The film pays lip-service to feminist themes while reveling in the sex appeal of Mr. Ledger, which seems to easily forgive his misogynist outlook. Also, there is passing mention of the horrible crimes of Edward, the Black Prince of Wales, but the medieval world we see is one of cheering peasants and beautiful royalty.  The question is, why bother to put any of this in?The answer is: the filmmakers shouldn't have.  Where the film wins is with the energy and willingness to please.  This is a fun popcorn movie that could have been so much more, but alas! it isn't.  I'd predict a mild hit if Mummy Returns doesn't steal too much audience.A 5/10 -- bonus for the pasta mixed in with splinters of wood in the jousts.",A Knight's Tale

From the very beginning, the music never seemed to go with the picture and it's neither period nor contemporary.  I was expecting Queen based on the marketing campaign, but the rest of the stuff is twenty-five years old and it wasn't all that fresh back then.  It's been overplayed on Classic rock radio for twenty years and some of it's been used in Commercials.If this movie doesn't make the 200 Million that it should, someone should go back into the edit room and put in the kind of emotional score that I bet Carter Burwell has already created.

298,MrMojoRising,I'm afraid not Mr. Helgeland,4,2 March 2002,"Brian Helgeland certainly hasn't done his directing career any favours with this silly, unrewarding family movie.After the tour de force script for LA Confidential, Heldgeland turned his hand to directing with the dark, gritty and highly engaging Gibson remake of Payback, but seems to want to show the world his gentle side with this take on oldentimes, knights and jousting.There are a few modern referances - the nike stripes on the armour, the crowd singing 'we will rock you' and, conidering the target audiece, a a somewhat bizzarre choice in a David Bowie track for a dancing scene. This could have worked nicely, but the idea loses steam, and rings hollow towards the end. Campared to a film like Moulin Rouge which fused modern songs effortlessy into the historical Parisian backdrop, Helgeland needn't have bothered.The performanes are nothing special - Heath Ledgers clunky turn accompanied by an odd American/English/Australian accent brings his star status seriously into question. Rufus Sewel plays a meanie as well as the uninspiring script will let him, the only standout is Paul Bettany who plays Geoffrey Chaucer. The Chaucer idea was a nice one, but really wasn't used as cleverly as it could have been.What really lets this down is a storyline that is dull, plain and simple. The standard 'boy from the wrong side of the tracks makes good' has been done a million times before a million times better, and the bulk of the 'action' is taken up by one jousting session after the other, the diretion is so flat you just want something else to happen. A weak, utterly predictable ending is a surefire bet, but you really don't care, as all interest is lost way before you realise it's a good half hour too long.
Along with Pearl Harbour and the laughable 'reimagining' of Planet of the Apes, this is one to consign to the 2001 dustbin of movie shame.",A Knight's Tale

300,crystian,"Seen it twice, lets make it thrice",10,25 June 2001,"Personally, I thought this movie has been shortchanged quite a bit. The humor in it was dazzling. I wasn't expecting at all what I was privileged to see the first time. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The sarcasm, wit, and yes, the ""cheesy"" love story was well written. It was written the way most want it to be. No real twists or turns just a romantic tale of the chivalrous times. The second time I was able to see it, I was able to focus more on detail. The actors costumes, set design, and overall appearance was set perfectly in motion. This movie was not meant to be serious, just a feel good movie and it succeeded at that. I would definately recommend it.",A Knight's Tale

The costumes and the sets are great, and pretty authentic too I might add.  The plot, however, is a little thin, and the blatantly anachronistic nature of the music and the dance added to the implausibility of the movie.

However, this is a good movie, with great cinematography. The plot it self is not that great, but it's certainly isn't bad, as long as you don't expect a movie based on historical facts. Heath Ledger and Alan Tudyk plays their roles quite good, but Paul Bettany plays superb - a perfect job done by Francine Maisler.

This is a comedy adventure about a young man who dares to live his dream of being a knight and fighting in the tournaments of medieval Europe.The movie has an old fashion feel, it's a very simple tale with little depth,serious plotting or characterisation. This is the kind of movie that popcorn was invented for.At heart it may be old fashion but it has some modern sensibilities. There are some great comical moments that rest on very 'out of place' modern elements being thrown into the mix. The opening scene is a good example which has the tournament spectators clapping and singing along to Queen's 'We Will Rock You'. Its a scene which tells you to lighten up, don't watch the movie's historical setting with a critical eye, it is simply a backdrop. The two hours that follow that scene are very likely to leave you feeling....good.Just watch and enjoy!",A Knight's Tale

This should tell you just how ""un-absorbing"" the plot of this film really is. I was expecting a bit more, a better comedy, but this is just too close to ""Robin Hood Man In Thights"" for my liking. Yes, I laughed at the jokes, but there just wasn't enough of them and most of them were in the style of playing ""we will rock you"" at the tournament, or having a Nike logo on the armour, or the outrageous (for the period in the history) outfits of the female lead.

307,neverteller33,Who knew clichés can be so much fun?,6,22 May 2013,"This movie is delicious and fresh. Clean, honest and sweet. It takes some very old themes and stories and purposefully brews them into a wonderfully balanced, lighthearted comedy that can, for some people at least, quench the thirst for something unpretentiously sincere. This is the story of William, a squire of modest origins who, through a game of chance and will and with the help of his friends manages to become a knight of great renown. Of course, that involves some cunning, confronting an arch-enemy and a love story with a princess. All this, presented in a self-aware, leisurely fashion that makes you glad these clichés exist. Because the film builds on them with a true devotion to fun. So don't go expecting historical accuracy or complex characters. This is not what the film is meant to be. Rather, you should expect modern music in all the right moments, an unbelievably good cast, clean humour, some sonnet-like moments and all in all a fantastic little comedy that aims no higher than to entertain. Surely, this must count for something, seeing as nowadays almost all Hollywood productions seem to aim much higher than they are capable of flying.",A Knight's Tale
308,Billy the Kid,"A confused, poorly-written, badly-acted mess",3,23 February 2002,"This is not a movie that I would normally bother to comment on, but in this case, I feel compelled to provide some relief from the inexplicably positive tone of the reviews on this site. Simply put, ""A Knight's Tale"" is a bad film. Chief among its many weaknesses is that it seems to suffer from a sort of multiple personality disorder. Although I was not enthralled with the use of modern music and dance, I was willing to accept them. I have no problem with films that adopt a tongue-in-cheek approach to the past (I enjoyed ""Start the Revolution Without Me,"" for instance), as long as they do not take themselves too seriously. This, however, is exactly what ""A Knight's Tale"" does. As early as the first scene, the film establishes its light, revisionist style, but with the romance between William and Jocelyn and the cheesy subplot involving William's father, the film abandons its earlier lightheartedness and instead displays pretensions of becoming a serious drama. After seeing Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" played at a medieval jousting tournament, how can the audience be expected to take anything seriously? ""A Knight's Tale,"" then, is marred by a failed and misguided attempt to transcend the boundaries of tongue-in-cheek comedy.Other problems also exist with this film. The dialogue is poorly written, the plot is downright cheesy, and the characters (particularly William, played by Heath Ledger, Adhemar, played by Rufus Sewell, and Kate, played by Laura Fraser) are flat, badly-acted stereotypes. Only Paul Bettany brings some life to this mess with his performance as Geoffrey Chaucer. ""A Knight's Tale"" is certainly not the worst film ever produced, but is one that should be avoided nonetheless.",A Knight's Tale

The opening scene where they show the medieval spectators pounding, clapping and even singing along to Queen's song ""We Will Rock You"" leaves one with the feeling that the movie is going to be a farcical display at best. To my great relief this movie turned out to be one of the best as far as sheer joy to watch that I have seen for a while. A humorous intense action filled journey of a young mans drive to become what he knows he can be, his trio of hilarious companions, a romantic interest and a villainous Knight make this a captivating tale.

Well, I was wrong.  This movie is pitiful.  From the opening credits to the last flatulent frame this movie delivers zero entertainment. The ""action"" sequences were filmed from the worst possible angles (only Michael Bay could have filmed it worse) and were plainly staged.

The music worked which is really good because something like that could have backfired and ruined the movie.  But it just added to it's humor and charm.Though the story is a bit predictable, its still fun and worth the money to see.

317,trevisthomas,Horrible almost comedic soundtrack completely undermines an other wise well constructed film.,7,25 April 2001,"A Knight's Tale (2001) [7.2/10] A Knights Tale started straight down the drain from the very beginning. The first few minuets beg you not to take the film seriously. I felt like I was watching some silly spoof, think Robin Hood Men in Tights. I gave serious consideration to just taking a nap to hurry an end to the horror. It's so bad it's laughable. In the ridiculous intro a group of people in middle ages Europe are out to watch Knights Joust and they're singing and clapping their hands to ""We will, we will, rock you"" like there at some modern day high school football game. Too call it absurd would be an understatement. The idiocy is rampant in the entirely inappropriately music score. It's loaded with 70's and 80's rock classics and they fit about as well as my ass in a Speedo. Normally a bad movie can be forgiven for doing stupid things, I mean it's a bad movie what do you expect, but A Kights Tale isn't a bad movie! Actually, the story is quite good. Both the acting and dialog in many of the emotionally tense and touching scenes are very well done. But all of that is undermined by random moments of stupidity. It's like they're using a crow bar to pry you from the movies artificial world, with it's well done period sets and costumes. It's pretty obvious that they were trying to lighten the mod of the movie a bit to give the movie a better chance at being accepted by adolescents, but I think it was a horrible decision. So much so that I would go so far as to say that it was offensive. I'm sorry to all of the people who tried so hard to make this a touching story of heroism and honor, to see their work undermined by such avoidable stupidity must be truly heartbreaking. But as I said, the good scenes in the film are really good. I very rarely get to the point were I'm as disconnected from and dismayed by a film as I was today during the first part of this film. For me to come almost full circle at some moments later is a true testament to how well done some of the more serious scenes are constructed. I'm at a complete loss as to why the film can't stay true to that. It's like every 3rd day of production they let an idiot on to the set to actively sabotage the production of the good screenplay.I think the thing that upsets me the most is that 7.2 is so unfair to most of this movie's top notch effort. It could have easily gotten almost a one and a half points higher by making some simple changes. Oh well, maybe next time.",A Knight's Tale

And what a horribly misguided film that seems to have this moral: Winning is everything, and the stuff that comes along with it (i.e., women, money, fame) is great. Ledger is great, as is his group of friends.  Unfortunately, they had little to work with in Helgeland's formulaic, roll-your-eyes-to-the-heavens-it's-so-bad script. This is disappointing considering Helgeland has done some fine work--L.A. Confidential, Payback.  And it's not so much the silly modernization of the medieval 'sport' that makes the film bad as it is the inconsistencies within the world created for the film, which are too numerous to list.  Overlong by at least a half-hour, A Knight's Tale wastes a fine cast on this absurd story which I hope doesn't sour Hollywood to genre projects.  Not that this is really genre, but rather uses it as a mask to hide the run-of-the-mill American sports film to sucker in people like, well, I guess like me.  Of course, this film will probably make a ton of money just to spite me now. I hope Helgeland's next project is absolutely fanatastic--he'll need to redeem himself.",A Knight's Tale

The costumes were on a level of their own, again combining the past and present without losing the medieval feel.
Every single actor performed well in this film. I must point out the performances of Paul Bettany and Nick Brimble as being truly remarkable. Shannyn Sossamon was good too, and anything but a wimpy damsel. And, of course, Heath Ledger stole the show with his good looks, charming accent, and great acting skills.The plot is a good one, although there are some predictable parts. But, then again, almost all movies have some predictable parts, so I can't complain. The humor is delightful. The jousting scenes were very well done. The love story is a nice one.

330,gunnerthekiwi,Surprisingly Charming!,6,24 July 2007,"""A Knight's Tale"" is the story of William, a young squire with a gift for jousting. After his master dies suddenly, the squire hits the road with his cohorts Roland and Wat. On the journey, they stumble across an unknown writer, Chaucer. William, lacking a proper pedigree, convinces Chaucer to forge genealogy documents that will pass him off as a knight. With his newly-minted history in hand, the young man sets out to prove himself a worthy knight at the country's jousting competition, and finds romance along the way.Now, let's make things clear. This isn't supposed to be an engaging, intelligent masterpiece. Nor is it supposed to be historically accurate. This film was made for one thing and one thing only - to entertain. And entertain it undoubtedly does.Sure the plot is paper-thin, the characters one-dimensional, (""let's give Count Adhemar a scary black horse and play spooky music whenever he appears on screen"") and the ending shamefully predictable but (god only knows how) it all works! This film could have been an absolute bomb but amazingly writer and director, Brian Helgeland, managed to transform what must've looked like a hugely mediocre idea to the studios into a respectable romantic comedy.Although the acting is (perhaps deliberately) cheesy, Heath Ledger, an Australian and Alan Tudyk, a Texan must be praised for delivering very decent attempts at English accents. The rest of the cast is passable as well and Paul Bettany (""A Beautiful Mind,"" ""Wimbledon"") is particularly enjoyable as Chaucer, a bard with a gambling addiction. He provides the majority of the chuckles and his speeches that precede William's matches are a highlight.There are many anachronisms in ""A Knight's Tale,"" perhaps most prominent is the rock music that plays during the jousts. This is reminiscent of a number of modern sports movies (in particular movies based on gridiron/ American football) and although you might be concerned that such music would seem ridiculous when used in a film set in medieval times, you may be pleasantly surprised that it somehow fit's the situation quite seamlessly, the satire in these sequences is spot on.So although ""A Knight's Tale"" is certainly not devoid of flaws, it is an entertaining, light-hearted film that will please most audiences. Don't be expecting genius, this isn't ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but receive this with an open mind and you won't be disappointed. Romantic-Comedies aren't exactly my cup of tea, I tend to enjoy films with more substance, but because of it's quiet appeal and subtle charm I give ""A Knight's Tale"" a respectable 7/10.",A Knight's Tale

But every time I started getting into the (somewhat thin) plot, or accepting that it was a tongue-in-cheek period piece, magically, some ridiculously out of place '70s or '80s rock song would blast away any chance I had of enjoying the flick. To whatever degree I was absorbed by the movie, one of these songs would come on, and I was immediately sucked out of the movie and found myself looking around at the rest of the audience to see the varying degree of surprise on their faces at the absurd placement of the song, and there were some chuckles and scrunched up faces. What was the music man or woman thinking?? The songs were about as appropriate as putting Led Zeppelin or The Beatles in Saving Private Ryan (noting that they're totally different levels and types of movies, but equally inappropriate places to use this type of music as a backing). Good bands but not for the show...  The sad thing was that I saw about five different articles or clips on how Ledger turned down scripts for 2 years to avoid getting type cast as a teen movie player. So he does a decent non-teen movie, then the editors take his work, slap this ridiculous sound track behind it, and turn it back into a teen-movie. Anyway, it was educational... I found out that you can play Queen's lead guitar licks with those funny looking long trumpets that they had back in Merry-Old-England or wherever that joust was - didn't know that before.",A Knight's Tale
341,kbmoshea,A fun night out movie,9,13 May 2001,"Very fun film, a perfect mindless summer night out. The use of seventies rock such as Queen and David Bowie could have been bad, but just added to the fun atmosphere, as did the crowd at the jousts doing the ""wave"" and Geoffrey Chaucer introducing the hero just like a Don King would at a boxing match. It was no Gladiator, but that's not entirely a bad thing. It didn't worry about historical details or even a heavy-handed plot. The characters each stood out in their own right, the action was decent, and the dialogue hilarious. Overall, excellent summer flick.",A Knight's Tale

It was a perfect combination of action, romance and comedy to make a truly dynamic film.  It had a very intreguing blend of medieval culture and 20th century music which surprisingly blended very well.  It was a roller coaster of emotions keeping you right on the edge of your seat one moment and teary eyed the next.  The villain was devilishly villainous and the good guy was nobly honourable creating the perfect conflict making every struggle a memorable one.  Walking out of this movie I felt very satisfied that I took the time after a long days work to sit and enjoy it and I would recommend it to anyone.",A Knight's Tale

I came out of the cinema very happy I had seen what I believe to be one of the best films ever. The plot was brilliant and it had everything in it, a terrible villain, a romantic interest and even a very tear-jerking scene, which is the only film so far to make me even come close to crying, and even when I see the scene again and again it still sends shivers down my spine.Although you can really tell what is going to happen at the end, it is one of the few films where you really want it to happen. It's one of those films where you either love it or hate it, as you can tell I loved it and it definitely deserved the 10 out of 10 I gave it, I would recommend this to anyone.",A Knight's Tale
345,WFDesigns,Excellent comedic performances,9,12 May 2001,"To be completely honest, I own films such as ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"" and Monty Python's Holy Grail.  As soon as ""A Knight's Tale"" is released on DVD, I will own it as well.This is not a serious medieval drama such as ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" or ""Braveheart"".  This is a great comedy/action flick about the love of a peasant that becomes a knight by an internal motivation to do so.  You can't do anything but laugh at some scenes (such as the intro's of Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein of Gelderland, or the ""Gelderland dance"").  If the writers of this movie didn't want you to find it humorous, they wouldn't have incorporated classic rock songs into the script. If you are into RenFaires or seeing guys in metal get smashed with the blunt end of a broadsword, go see this movie.  ...you may want to wait until it's in the $1.00 theatre's though.  :o)8/10",A Knight's Tale

In fact, I feel I'm doing myself a disservice by wasting more time on it by writing this review.I guess it's not really THAT bad, but certainly getting there. As the movie opens, the crowd is clapping along to ""We Will Rock You"", so the expectation is that there will be many such familiar, modern rock songs in the remainder of the film. Alas, not to be; they don't carry along with the gimmick.The plot is so cliched and worn that you lose interest very quickly. Even the action sequences were quite lame - there are only so many times you can watch two armoured blokes battling with jousting sticks. Towards the end I was waiting for the hero to employ a ""Karate Kid"" style special move that would vanquish the toughest enemy, but the film-makers cannot even incorporate this very special cliche. The writer/director, Brian Helgeland, was the writer for ""L.A. Confidential"", so you would expect a lot more from this guy. Not to be.",A Knight's Tale

If you are looking for a historically accurate movie, or a movie that will provoke deep thought, don't waste your time.  However, if you want to have fun and see a movie that will leave you feeling great, MAKE IT A POINT TO SEE THIS FILM!  It is funny, cute, loving, and very well made.  The movie incorporates modern music, dialog, and dancing into a story about the past.  From the opening scene it is evident that this movie took a risk in the way it tells the gripping story of a peasant struggling to better his position in life.

This is a brilliant movie with many intricate points played out in so many subtle and not-so-subtle ways. I laughed all the way through this movie, it is so funny, perfectly balanced and interesting. It mixes factual accuracy with fashionable fiction and leaves the viewer absolutely  stunned.From the cover you feel the movie will be dark, and from the initial idea I think it conveys this idea, but from the second you turn it on this idea vanishes and you are left with a pretty much unknown cast leading you down the road of wonderment and fantasy. Watch it twice to make sure you pick up all the subtle moves made by the Director and the rest of the crew.

352,guatama,What the world needs now is more cinematic product placement!,4,11 July 2002,"What do the song `Low Rider' and medieval knightly tournaments have in common?  Give up?  Nothing.  However, Brian Helgeland felt it important to utilize several pop-culture references (ranging from Nike swooshes to chanting `we will, we will rock you') to help the audience `make a connection' with his story of a young squire's dream of becoming a knight. Well thank you!  God knows my borderline primate intellect would have been completely thrown without these references.  What an absolutely BRILLIANT cinematic framing device!  I wonder how this concept could be applied to other films.Consider Braveheart.  If only Korn or Limp Bizkit had been playing during the first battle scene.  I truly believe my ability to bridge the communication gap and fully understand the nature of 13th century infantry warfare would have been more aptly fulfilled.  Or what if we ditch that crazy nonsensical jibber-jabber about a true democratic Roman senate, and center the conflict between Maximus and Comedus around the plight of non-cool people being denied shopping rights at Eddie Bauer?  Or perhaps, instead of `Romeo & Juliet', Joseph Finnes captures the true essence of human love in a hip-hop love ballad, R. Kelly style, for the movie Shakespeare in Love.So, I applaud this new cinematic direction lead by Brian Helgeland. Why should filmmakers be forced to bind themselves to such creativity-limiting apparatuses as historical accuracy or thematic cohesion?  Simply put -- if I can't believe in a world where the citizens of midieval England chant along with Freddie Mercury, then I'm not sure I can believe in America!",A Knight's Tale

Over all it was okay, but there are some points that i would like to make. I enjoyed the performances of heath ledger, the blacksmith lady, and Paul bettany, whom i adore and admire, but i did not feel it necessary for him to be ""trudging"" as it may be wearing nothing but his skin, and although i enjoy his work, i do not enjoy his rear end, especially whereas i saw it more that once. Other than that, hi did a wonderful job as Geoffrey Chaucer, and the comedy was fresh, for i had been watching the same movies over and over again for quite come time. i also feel that the actress who played Jocilyn(spelling???) did not portray the character she could have been, and at times, she was not believable in her role. Rufus Sewell did a great job as adomar, and over all, the movie was alright.",A Knight's Tale

Chaucer is a great character and adds much to the movie.  Heath Ledger screen presense is great and you definitely know that he is on the screen.The action sequences are great and it will make a very nice demonstation piece for the home theatre when it comes out on DVD.  The story at times is a bit weak, but it really is a fun movie.  I believe this movie was more designed to leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling.

And please it does.It's a movie about a sport, that sport is jousting. It tells the story of jousting though plenty of action and cool music (ie. Queen's ""We Will Rock You""). You can go see this movie anytime and for any reason.

356,Azek_,A refreshing medieval adventure.,8,22 May 2001,"To tell you the truth, the first time I saw the trailer; I wondered how good a medieval movie who used ""We Will Rock You."" in the trailer could be. And when I saw that they did use that very same song in the first moments of the movie and people actually reacted to the song as if they heard it and everything was cool; I was even more curious... would that movie be some sort of idiotic comedy? Quite fortunately, it wasn't. Although it's true that certain musical and not-so-musical anachronisms are present in the movie, they were placed there on purpose to lighten un the flick and, probably, attract or please a younger crowd. Whatever the reason for their existence in the movie, the ambiance they create sorta grows on you and soon, you can't help it, but to like those and the sometimes cheesy humor. The characters are attaching: Shannyn Sossamon was great in her first movie and Paul Bettany played his role very well.

Most of the characters are just cartoonish caricatures, and their dialogue, actions, and aspirations are enough to make one want to groan.I did find about 15 to 20 minutes of footage scattered through out the movie to be enjoyable though.

Since I love the medieval era, I also love  movies that take place in that time. However, this movie tried to bring the medieval times to todays times by playing modern music throughout the movie.

364,ebonyfuchsia,This film has one Hell of a nerve!!!,2,18 December 2007,"As far as entertainment is concerned, I would rate this film 6 out of 10, because its so abundant with rude remarks, fast-and-furious action and commonplace comedy it is easy to sit down and laugh at it, therefore providing viewers with meaningless fun. But there is such a lack of sincerity, such a blatant effort to transform an age of chivalry into our own modern age, that I could only argue with the film when I saw it on television. Where should I begin? The Medieval era {in which the film is allegedly set} was a time of chivalry; men did not-in fact WOULD not!- strut about indulging in sex-based conversation with women, as a matter of fact men and women of the Medieval era would NOT have met up, flirted and then slept together because there were severe rules against this kind of behaviour! The main female character, Jocelyn, can just flirt as much as she likes and then offer herself up as a prize to William, whereas many high class Medieval women were kept under lock and key with 'chastity belts!!! Being a woman myself I find that quite disturbing, but no matter how eerie it is couldn't the film makers just accept that this was how it was in those days? Not only were men and women chaste because chastity was enforced upon them...men and women were poetical, genteel, loving towards one another. There was no animalistic hunger to sleep with woman after woman, or man after man. Love was a delicate and sensitive issue in those times, and the film's only tribute to this is an insipid poem that William and his cronies write together...it hardly sounds Medieval, does it? No lengthly, elaborate, passionate sentences, no wildly fantastical imagery...that poem sounded like some half-baked Beetles song! Speaking of songs, the soundtrack to this bland little piece of entertainment was just absurd. I adore Queen and Bowie, and it made me want to wrench my spleen out seeing their bohemian, elegant, revolutionary songs in this trash. Obviously the director heard Queens 'We Will Rock You' and the lyrics 'mud on your face' and 'waving your banner all over the place' and decided to make the song his possession by tying it to his scrappy, irritating vision of the Medieval era. God bless Freddy Mercury who died a true artist...your song deserved better than this! The costumes were, in a word, REPULSIVE. Why swap the flowing gowns and tall, embroidered coronets of the Medieval era for multi-coloured hair extensions, porcupine buns and face paint just slapped on anywhere it is preferred? Why does Jocelyn first appear in a 1930's cloche hat and then appear later in an Edwardian races hat? Why do all the people watching the joust wear woad on their faces, as if its some kind of football match? Again, in the Medieval era, jousting was an act of chivalry-it wasn't a common sport that peasants gathered around to gloat upon. It was something only aristocrats could watch, because most of the time the two rivals were trying to impress a particular maiden. I suppose the film incorporates that, but not as an act of chivalry-as a statement between two testosterone-fuelled lads, one who wants the pouting, glowering, gloating dumbo Jocelyn as his next horse!! Are we meant to care if Jocelyn gets saddled by Adhemar? Are we meant to care if William doesn't 'change his stars'? Are we meant to care about the constant, infantile quarrels between the red-haired nut case and the ill-conceived Geoffery Chauncer {another poet transformed into a boisterous, loud-mouthed yob!)??? Is the conclusion of the tale meant to be poignant, or intoxicating, or beautiful? Oh its such an adorable cliché! Rags to riches, zero to hero boy-wonder must rescue the feisty, attitude-problem heroine from the nasty, sneering, motiveless villain and then they all live happily ever after! Its SO INSIPID!!! I think the only character I actually respect is Laura Fraser's farrier, who was always neglected and insulted by her comrades despite all the nice things she did for them...she has such a lovely voice, and her presence was very sincere, whereas everybody else was just making jokes, shouting, pouting, fighting, running around to that completely ridiculous soundtrack!

This movie is not too realistic because of all this modern swearing (son of a b*tch, Sh*t etc) and Eminem's song at the beginning of movie (well yeah, that was very weird), but for a comedy it's alright.

366,axelswag,This is a Disney Film. Enjoy the fantasy!,3,23 March 2005,"** SPOILER included, but do you care? ** The first fifteen minutes of ""A Knight's Tale"" is the best part. We meet the characters of William, Rolland and Wat, peasants in the service of a jousting knight who has just died along a country roadside in Medieval England prior to a jousting tournament. Not knowing what to do, William (played by Heath Leger) decides to take the knights place and the name of Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein of Gelderland to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a knight and nobleman. For a brief moment, the clash between music and historical inaccuracy suspends when Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" is played to a roaring crowd of spectators at a joust. Strangely, it works! If rock-n-roll were around during the 1300-1400s this is what the crowds would thrill to.If ""A Knight's Tale"" had stuck to the story of William's quest to become a knight and the conflict between peasant and nobleman in Medieval class society, it would have made an interesting movie. It doesn't. Instead it falls into a complete muddle. A love story we could care less about. A two-dimensional bad guy, played by the excellent Rufus Sewell. Jousting tournaments which are fun family events but hold few consequences for our hero. In truth, jousting knights were often maimed and killed prompting a ban by English kings, but you would never know it from this movie. William, our hero, who is both broken during competition and tortured when he is arrested, still manages to win the 'World Tournament of Jousting', defeat the bad guy, win the girls heart, and become knighted by a really sensitive Prince Edward, and all without a scratch. Wow, all that could happen! I would have to say that the kind of viewers who thinks ""A Knight's Tale"" is great movie-making probably enjoys Renaissance Faires and Disneyland.

If you want a lighthearted, fun, and downright clever film with a wicked sense of humor, you've come to the right place.I first saw this movie when it hit DVD back in '01, maybe '02, I can't really remember...it's been so long, and I've watched it so many times since then I can't even count. Whenever I'm staring blankly at my DVD collection trying to decide what to watch, I know I can put this on and have a good time. I've always thought all the modern references (Nike, John Deere, the music) are really funny. I mean, come on, they're so blatant you just know they're having a good time. I'm not sure what all the hangup is about the inaccuracies. A movie that starts out with ""We Will Rock You"" in medieval England is not meant to be taken too seriously.On the other hand, something I did not see at first--and now have a very great appreciation and respect for--is the incorporation of Geoffrey Chaucer (real and fictitious). Of course I think Paul Bettany just steals the show. (""God I'm good!"") But more importantly, the references to the real Chaucer and his real work, _The Canterbury Tales_. Those of you who know them will know that there is one called _The Knight's Tale_, about a very upstanding, chivalrous knight (the only completely moral character in _Canterbury Tales_), hence Chaucer's line: ""I'm gonna have to write some of this down."" We also get to meet the Pardoner and the Summoner, who were both horrid characters. (""Peter, a humble pardoner, and purveyor of religious relics."" Which he is, in the story.) I was amazed at how much more appreciation I got for this movie after reading Chaucer's work.So yes, this is a fun, slightly satirical romp, no doubt about it, and even if you haven't read _The Canterbury Tales_ I really recommend it. It's predictable and sometimes a little Hollywood--yeah, that ending...But let me just say that there is definitely a reason I have nearly worn my DVD out.

We've seen lots of movies but have never seen this type of thing done this cleverly before. The acting was excellent all around.

If you think you will watch a historical movie with realism, you will most definitelly not, but that isn't something to criticize in this movie. Everything feels just as it is supposed to be. Despite it being not a really serious movie at first, it is packed with emotion. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. If you didn't shed at least one tear when that one scene came up (not gonna spoile it)... you're not human!
Watch this movie not as a medieval one, but one inspired by medieval times and chivalry!
Also, the blend of medieval and modern feels sooooo right, despite my scepticism. By modern, I mostly mean the music.
The actors were so diverse in their acting performances. Heath Ledger, you will be greatly missed. Paul Bettany makes this movie even more enjoyable by his impressive display of one and only Geoffrey Chaucer a.k.a. The Father of English Literature!

The fact that they mixed more modern fashions and music tastes really made this film appeal to me, and I believe made it stand out from the many other medieval movies. Heath Ledger was great in the role of the young man William striving to change his destiny, and the rest of the cast were great also. I especially loved Paul Bettany in the role of Geoffrey Chaucer. The story is well written and extremely entertaining. Wat is hilarious as the hot headed companion of William, and he perfectly balances the more rational thinking of Roland. I think that this film is a gem, and is one of my favourite movies.",A Knight's Tale
374,ravan1,The best film that you should not like,9,10 July 2017,"In reference to all the other reviews, yes this is pretty inaccurate, yes the music selection should not make sense, yes the plot is so formula and predictable it sounds like it was called in, that you should hate it...and yet I think it is a great film. It is fiction so it does not need to be accurate although there is some historical basis. As far as the music if you read the director comments he chose the music to give the same feeling of music that the people of that time felt for their music. And as far as the plot just because they use a formula that is predictable this film is a example being able to do it well. Even though the main message is to be true to yourself with honor and don't limit yourself ( I know how sappy that sounds) it is still nice to see it done with some style. So if you give this movie a chance I hope you like it as much as I did even though I shouldn't.",A Knight's Tale

I see the directors name on the screen and I realize I am watching the directors follow up to one of my favorite films... PAYBACK!!! I observe the cast I have seen these people before, but none in such a leading type role... all casting was damn near genius. For a bunch of up and coming actors, they all really pulled off a really good time. There is no way to pigeon hole this picture... cuz just when you think you have the answer to whats going to happen next, the director has you crying at the sons arrival, as a man, meeting his father for the first time since he was 8 or so years old. Its such a great time. Rugged action heroes, villains, court jesters, princess', and of course Knights!!! Thank god this much enjoyment isnt illegal... at least I hope not.THUMBS UP!!!!!

376,gzenon,It will definitely rock you,10,3 November 2001,"An all-around great movie, the biggest flaw some of the soundtrack choices (I'd have gone with more 90s and less 70s-early80s). The story  is both timeless and cliche, but it's a great idea--that a person can change his destiny, take control of his life, do it with courage, rely on good friends. What makes this film work is how it all comes together. The acting is great--all solid actors, they actually work well together and imbibe their characters with personality. It's definitely a group effort. Good cast choices, too. The writing also works; the dialogue witty, combining period-piece substance with modern attitude. The sets really take you back, the fact it was shot in Prague makes it all quite believable--the extras' ancestors surely saw their fair share of jousts. Also, there are so many little things that are part of a well-done movie, from the armor to all the hints of Chaucer. Many detractors cite the anachronistic soundtrack, but it works because it lets us in our time relate to the period of film. Definitely something to watch more than once and add to your collection.",A Knight's Tale
377,ghlthree,"Thin on plot, yet big on enjoyment",7,6 June 2004,"Silly, tongue-in-cheek, anachronistic, and faithful to no framework or style that would allow this film to ever be called 'good.' And yet, one point that this movie is evers-so-faithful to, and brings it back into the light of sincere enjoyment, the ever present question; ""Can a man change the stars?"" Without the overwhelming drama, overly formal ceremony, any great pretense, the protagonist in this film struggles to maintain the noblest quest undertaken by a person; to reach beyond what is 'understood' to be his station.Though it be rife with technical errors, it still balances the dramatic with the humorous and tells a story impossible to be taken seriously, and yet so easily enjoyed.

I knew it was going to be something of a farce, but I didn't realize just how much I was going to enjoy it.The characters have some dimension instead of just being the 'cute boy' and the 'stupid side kick'.  You could identify with them on several levels.Don't watch it for the costumes.  Don't watch it to find out how people acted in the middle ages.  Watch it because you want to have a good laugh and some enjoyment for a few hours.BTW, not to be missed are the hilarious moments with Chaucer heralding.

Unfortunately, they were all out. A few weeks later, I was able to rent it.
I liked the anachronism. It may not have been ""innovative,"" but I still liked it. Any movie that can make me roll in the floor laughing because a medieval crowd is stomping and clapping to ""We Will Rock You,"" the winners of a jousting tournament are disco dancing to ""Golden Years"" (a favorite song of mine, nonetheless), or the William and his crew ride into London to ""The Boys are Back in Town"" gets a lot of points. The four sidekicks were ultimately hilarious, especially during the dance lessons scene.The situation is not ""impossible."" I wouldn't be surprised that, if a knight was killed in joust, his servant would take his place. That may very well have happened. Sure, there were no ""World Championships"" of jousting, but it made for a good storyline.I liked A Knight's Tale and I recommend it to anyone who isn't going to be Holier-than-thou about it.

This film disappoints in so many ways I cannot write about them all.. bad dialogue, horrible acting, too many bit characters,predictable, they could not even get their history correct, crossing up their facts! I could tell from the start what I was in for as the opening scene opens with Queen's We will rock you, and the peasants are banging and clapping their hands to it, just like out of a bad Taco Bell commercial! (I apologize to the good people of Taco Bell, for they have nothing to do with this movie, and that is commendable!) The movie goes on to ruin other great Rock classics, much to my dismay.I must say that I was actually blessed this evening by not being able to watch the end joust, I am sure I know what happens, but, luckily the film tail wrapped, causing it to snap, stopping the projector, which I then had to fix the film. So as I have told my friends, if you are planning to watch this movie, please reconsider and schedule an appointment with your dentist. Trust me it will be more entertaining, and they can at least give you novacaine for the PAIN! Hopefully this review was helpful to whoever reads it.Thanks",A Knight's Tale

After seeing it three times, I can definitely say it was worth the $19.50 I had to pay. I would pay another $19.50 just to see him dance again (it was the perfect comedic touch). Watching him dance, I had the sudden urge to sing ""I love you baby, and if its quite all right, I need you baby.""

My advice is to go see this as soon as you possibly can!HOWEVER, don't go to see this movie if you are looking for historical accuracies (face it...no one is ever going to be historically accurate *and* this entertaining).  Do go see this film if you are a fan of renaissance faires and have a Monty Python sense of humour.  If you're able to laugh at the fact that the jousting audience pounds the wooden rails along with Queen singing ""We Will Rock You"" (which had me DYING with laughter) and if you're able to find great humour in the fact that these medieval folks boogie (literally) to David Bowie, then go see this film!  The way that they bring modern references into this historical era just reminded me of all the great times we've had at renaissance faires.  The clothing is far from accurate (surprise) but it sure is interesting.

Only he may not compete, his family isn't rich and he is a thatcher. So he makes up a false name. When he and his friends are on the way to Rouen they meet a writer who writes paintings of nobility. they need, otherwise he cant play in the jousting. of course there is a princess and a 'bad guy' who he needs to defeat to get the girl ;). it sounds a bit familiar but its not! the writers did everything they could to make this film special. there are lots of details. you really have to so this movie. you won't regret it!!

Because it does just that-- works. Even through the medival peasants singing and clapping to ""We Will Rock You"" to the strange medival ""prom"" scene. It all comes together... and instead of attributing it to ""somehow"", I feel the answer is quite obvious. It works because Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer MAKES it work. He ties us together... the audience watching the jousts in the movie and the audience in the theater... he makes it seem as though he is speaking to all of us at once, making us believe that we too are taking part in the movie. Without his role, the theater audience would simply be watching the movie, watching the audience react to Heath Ledger.

Later, the same effect at a banquet with people dancing to David Bowie's ""Golden Years"". Plus, a herald introducing the Hero like something out of the WWF.At times enchanting, at times so painfully bad I almost walked out (and several others in the theater did).This movie doesn't know what it is supposed to be.  It's not whimsical enough to be a fantasy, not funny enough to be a comedy, and not realistic enough to be taken seriously, but not *quite* bad enough that I didn't somehow enjoy it.It's like a peanut-butter and cheese sandwich.",A Knight's Tale

The movie would have been bad enough had that they played it straight, but with the modern rock, the Jean-Paul Gaultier-ish costumes and freakish make-up, it was pathetic.

""The music should have been an orchestral score.""  Yes.  Okay.  Musical styles from the 17th, 18th, and 19th, centuries are okay for a 14th century movie, but not 20th century music?  And the same thing with the language.  I'm sorry, but I don't speak French OR Middle English, (the correct languages of the time period) so I rather LIKE the idea of having it in a language I DO understand...Rather than ""old"" (Elizabethan) English which would have been an anachronism (8^þAnd someone said that Rufus Sewell didn't make his bad guy bad enough? What, does a villain have to be a serial killer to be a ""good"" villain? He's a slimy arrogant JERK who deserved to be put in his place.  And he was a human being as well.  It's called realism.  Hel-LO?  (okay, so maybe having a realistic bad-guy character mixed in with that level of anachronism was difficult to cope?)The interaction between the main characters is priceless, from the first scene to the last.  My only real problem with the movie is the length. It's too damn short!  Most of the scenes that were cut should be put back in, just to lengthen the wonderful experience that is A Knight's Tale.  If you haven't seen it, do so.  (Get the DVD, it's worth it for all the bonus features)I hope they never even consider a sequel, but I would dearly LOVE to see the entire cast reunited in another film.Bottom line, it's a fun and enjoyable movie, but not if you want a serious dissertation on the Middle Ages.  It is FUN, and has a few good messages along the way.  Buy/rent it.  Watch it.  Enjoy it.  And that's okay.  It is okay to enjoy a movie...even if it doesn't change the world.",A Knight's Tale

The directing isn't exactly inspired and the acting, with the notable exception of Paul Bettany as Chaucer (the highlight of the movie), is mediocre.The idea behind using modern music--to keep a sense of youth about the film, and the idea that the jousters were like the rock stars of their time--was good, but it was poorly executed.This film isn't supposed to be deep or intellectual, just entertaining, and in that aspect it delivers.  The sets and costumes are excellent, conveying the grittiness of peasant life as opposed to the opulence of the nobles, and watch for a few references to the Bible and Christendom.

From its irreverent look at Medieval life with authentic jousting and contemporary soundtrack. The actors are all fresh and have just the right spirit to match the film.However some of the plot twists and nuances are poorly edited and the story can jump on you at times. Examples: 1) The chopping of the cave scenes loses the link to the creation of Sir Ulrich. This leaves you wondering where they came up with all this. 2) Adamar's spy. You have to be very quick to realise that the lady following Will for about a 1 second shot is the same person who has led Adamar to Will's home.

The manipulative concepts of good vs. bad, that upper class is mean, love will conquer, the final action scenes will be shown in slow motion with someone yelling, and Hero will win over Nameless Pretty Face were used in the most ham-fisted manner.The characters were stereotypical, the action slightly dull - how many times can you watch a lance break?I want my two hours back.To make this movie interesting, take a drink every time one of the actors loses/regains their accent.No I wasn't expecting Olivier in HAMLET, but as summer twinkie movies go, this one is rotten.",A Knight's Tale

I remember it coming to theaters, and the entire idea of modern music supporting a medieval story sounded stupid. I expected it to be another stupid teen movie, half expecting to see Rachelle Leigh Cook or Freddie Prinze Jr. in the cast.After watching it once, I realized I was completely mistaken. I purchased the movie immediately and have watched it over two dozen times to date. The entire cast, who where relatively unknowns at the time, make this a masterpiece. You can easily fall in love with any one of them, and I none of them really do, or try, to outshine the other. Oddly the music, which you think would seem out of place, feels right at home. This movie is listed as a comedy, which it does have its share of, but I would personally place it as a fantasy drama. There are those certain movies out there that hit you in such an emotional way as to make you envy the characters lives. Such as when I first watched backdraft, and wanted to be a fireman, or watching Major League and wanting to be a pitcher. This movie made me want to buy a ""horse and a stick"" (which I haven't).No matter how many times I watch this, the introduction that Geoff gives, during the final match, still brings tears of joy to my eyes, and really sums up the entire movie in my eyes. A young man who is trying to live a better life for himself, and a father who gave him up to make that possible.",A Knight's Tale
410,Jamieven,A Splendid Mixture of 14 Century England and 20th Century Alternative Kick Ass!,9,12 May 2002,"This movie rock's you from the moment William steps upon a horse.  The chemistry between Heath and his men and Kate, is amazing, you will think they have been working together at their craft for years.  Their love for William, appears wholesome and true.I would say the only negative I found in the movie is the role of Jocelyn. She is an interesting and an attractive character, however, I kept asking myself, ""Why isn't Christiana the high Princess?""  her natural looks of the times, and her piercing brown eyes light up the screen.  Jocelyn is a very attractive woman, however, she has to use multiple ""props"" to enhance her appearance, such as the very unusual eye makeup, and her very 20th century wardrobe.  I believe she tries to hard to be as arrogant as William, where William seems natural, Jocelyn seems ""fake.""  I mean no offense to her, I personally believed Christiana should have been the high Princess, and Jocelyn her squire?Overall, this film rocks.  You find yourself staring at Heath Ledger and drawing a strong comparison to Mel Gibson.  Both Aussie's, and both known for outspoken behavior, there appearence in ""The Patriot"" truly saved a somewhat copy of ""Braveheart,"" but not nearly as intense, and remarkable.William's sporatic anger makes very little sense.  He court's Jocelyn, and when it seems Jocelyn has made it quite obvious she shares her affection for him (when she tells William wearing nothing will cause quite a stir). William attacks her calling her a ""little girl,"" and a ""girl with a flower."" Which begs the question why is he courting her, if he doesn't respect her?Overall, the movie was a welcome surprise, as we laugh with William and his merry men and woman, we share in the devotion he commands, and ultimately, we can't help but root for him to be the ""Champion.""  It is a bit of a cliche', but what isn't in today's culture.The soundtrack kicks serious ass.  I was waiting for Queen's, ""We are the Champions,"" during the final battle with Attimar, however, we heard AC/DC? instead?Definitely worth keeping, don't know if I will buy the DVD, but VHS tape is a worthy nine bucks!Jamie",A Knight's Tale

Heath Ledger as Sir William, a humble squire, wants to be a knight and when his master dies he has a chance to try out with the fake identity.A Knight's Tale is one of those films, which first get you thinking ""What is going on? This just can't be a good film"". Choice of music is indeed a rather contemporary, but soon cheerful atmosphere grabs your attention and the movie turns out to be one of the funniest and warmest medieval age comedies. Not that there's much movies in that genre though.Film features totally inaccurate history, popular modern music, such as rock, in comparison to historical scenery and a lot of little puns related to our times. Opening scene with ""We Will Rock You"" is just brilliant in all corniness.All elements are just plain wrong, but oddly enough they work perfectly together. Actors look like they've had fun of their lifetime and it shows up on a screen. Everyone seems to be enjoying their role. Paul Bettany as a writer Geoffrey Chaucer and Sir William's Herald did a fantastic work. Applause for him and his speeches!The way jousting was filmed did work very well and wasn't stretched to be too long or pathetic. Love story within the film wasn't tacky at all and supported other parts well.Story itself is a rather simple one with basic Hollywood cliches and the plot is wayyy predictable. That doesn't matter at all as the pace is pretty fast and the mood is joyful. It did even raise some emotions to surface despite of corny elements.I think Knights Tale shows a lively and even some ways a more realistic picture of people and life in old ages than many serious movies do. People had a sense of humor back then too, I assume. But knowledge of history is definitely not needed and the more you are interested in historical accuracy, the less you'll enjoy this experience. This is a comedy, not a history lesson.Cheerful funny warm flick, I enjoyed.",A Knight's Tale
413,Liss,It would be wonderful if the music were better.,2,29 December 2002,"Going into this movie, I thought I'd hate it, but the story was endearing. The only thing I have to say about it, was...every time I felt pulled in by the story, a modern rock song would be played and I'd get pushed out of the mood.  Music sets the tone of the movie, and this music kept pushing me out of the tone of the period.Knights didn't rock out to ""We will rock you"" and to have a whole crowd sing it was just plain...cheesey and made the movie less.  I can understand not being able to afford composers and good music, but to cheese out like this reminds me of cheap B movies of barbarians who killed to electric guitar music.I would have loved this movie, if the music would have been better thought out.  The fact that this woman was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world and yet she was rather unattractive did pull from it too. Everyone made a fuss and she was plain at best.  The fact that they started dancing like it was a 1980's prom also hurt the movie.",A Knight's Tale
414,Laynarrr,Brilliant.,10,24 July 2015,"This is one of my favorite movies. Everything about this movie is fantastic. The plot, although a bit childish and cheesy at times, is interesting and fun, with a nice sense of unobtrusive humor. All characters are great, especially Ulrich's team. They must be the best team ever on a screen. The ending, although expected, is beautiful and refreshing. The selection of actors is amazing - never enough mourned Heath Legder, one of the most beautiful actresses Shannyn Sossamon, charming and special Paul Bettany, always nice to watch Rufus Sewell, adorable and fun Alan Tudyk and my personal eye-candy James Purefoy. I mostly loved how the plot, yet simple and familiar, is enriched with some original details, such as reference to The Canterbury Tales and mixing some modern stuff. I especially loved the part when they dance to David Bowie song :) and Jocelyn's styling. Anyway, this movie is original, fun and refreshing to watch. I recommend it to everybody full heartedly.",A Knight's Tale
415,sara_jang,Loved it,10,5 June 2004,"My daughter recommended this movie to me, and from the description, I thought it would be lame. But I absolutely loved it. I have lost count of how many times I have watched it. It is so full of wonderful background, and each time I watch it, I can focus on another area of screen. The costumes of the extras are so great, the expressions on their faces are very interesting. The props and real life buildings are also very interesting. One would think that the modern music would be totally out of place in this film, but it made it all the more enjoyable. I have watched the dance scene dozens of times, and it is fun to focus on a different dancer every time and watch their moves and expressions. It's now my all time favorite movie.",A Knight's Tale
416,martin-brogdon,"Performances of PB, RS, HL, AT, and MA make this movie a classic",9,26 April 2019,"I'm not saying this movie is like ""The Godfather"", but when you examine this movie under the lens that movies should be benchmarked against (pure enjoyment, emotion-eliciting, etc.), this movie grades out so well. A rags-to-riches plot, a love story with Characters you fall in love with yourself (Heath Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon), one of the most easily hatable villains in movie history (Rufus Sewell), brilliant comedic relief (Alan Tudyk), phenomenal character development through friendship (Mark Addy), and a coming-home jerk that makes me cry every time. The entire scene of William's interaction with his father in the ""current"" time (father is blind, let his son go off years before, not thinking he would ever see him again (because he gave him away to a knight when he still had sight, not because he's blind)) is amazing, and the moment his father asks if his son has followed his stars gets me every time. Invokes so much raw emotions. Now, the inclusion of classic rock songs framed in medieval times might be one of the cheesiest mistakes of this movie, but it still plays decently (one of the funniest aspects of this movie is identifying the extras that have no clue how the *stomp**stomp**clap* progression works for Queen's ""We Will Rock You""). This is the perfect movie to watch when you are searching for that Friday or Saturday night surprise movie, that ends up squeaking into your top 100.",A Knight's Tale

Tongue-in-cheek humor is administered throughout, much of it appropriately timed. The cast is superior (observe Bettany's mastering of his craft), as they are believable and likable. Casenove's performance as John Thatcher is superb and touching. Not to be taken too seriously, this movie will please if viewed for what it is- an action comedy. Keep watching after the credits for a funny clip ;). Also recommended: First Knight, King Arthur (2004), Rob Roy, Braveheart, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.",A Knight's Tale

I saw that in the previews and thought this would be the stupidest movie ever. Horrible mistake that was. I swore to never watch it. Years later at a friends house there was a movie was already playing on his TV. There was some guys naked butt. Not my favorite thing. But the dialog that followed was quite interesting. I watched the rest of the movie and was amazed. It was A Knight's Tale. Missing the very beginning I missed the scene I hated. The rest was great. Great action, good romance, great dialog, great acting, and most of all just fantastic characters. I ran to the store and bought the DVD the next day and watched it twice that night. It isn't a serious movie. It is more Shanghi Noon than Braveheart. After watching it a dozen times or so I don't mind the bad scene at all. The rest I just love.",A Knight's Tale
420,cfallsprod,Wonderful movie,10,28 January 2008,"A wonderful surprise--one of those generally unknown but must-see films. This movie is just plain fun and totally enjoyable, starring two of my favorite actors--Heath Ledger and Paul Bettany. Does have some unusual moments mixing contemporary dialogue and music in an otherwise period piece but for some magical unknown reason it totally works. Kudos to the filmmakers who apparently wanted to just make an entertaining movie. It's obvious with the modern music and ""artistic license"" of history (ie, Chaucer as a character) that they were just having fun.One of my all-time favorite films. This is one of those movies that, whenever you come across it on cable, you just have to watch it no matter how many times you've already seen it.",A Knight's Tale

422,k-vissers,Missed opportunity,8,20 November 2005,"As it isn't often I get an opportunity to see a new costume drama (a favorite genre) I was eager to see this one- and disappointed it didn't meet my expectations. As for historical plausibility (accuracy would sound absurd here, but we don't always need that in fiction) one wonders if they even tried- if so, their research team deserves to be flogged out of the business for good, this historian says. No doubt some anachronisms are intended, but unless you go for the Mel Brooks formula (Robin Hood in Tights works) it's a thin rope only far more skilled (usually British) writers can afford to walk; in stead we hear and see for example a tournament audience 'rocking' to a score better fit for a hooligan story, and poor costumes in insulting colors pain your eyes when they should be feasting on a romantic banquet. Heath Ledger's boyish charm works for the -pointless- amorous side story, but while he was perfect for The Patriot he is lost as a would-be knight- apparently aristocratic style is not one of many qualities that make Aussies lovable, after all they have been known to use the same word posh for 'British' as well as for 'pompous ass', and a miscast (though talented) lead is a usually fatal handicap. Classy Brits Rufus Sewell and James Purefoy (neither well enough known then, so the casting was probably good value for money) prove talent can still impress with sheer classical acting despite the almost hopeless surroundings. Although the part of 'Geoffrey Chaucer' as a bare-arse gambler-forger is a bit too much, Paul Bettany does a fair job, and lovers of manly nude will not be disappointed by his exposed scenes (unless your censor cut these out). All in all, the cast deserved a far better script and production, the team behind the screens won't challenge the BBC's record in costume drama if they try all this new millennium. Despite the spoiler warning, let's not bother with the 'story': there's nothing to spoil, you're almost bound to guess every 'turn' well in advance.",A Knight's Tale

424,oilersgurl-1,A Knights Tale is hilarious.,10,18 March 2006,"I first saw this movie when it first came out... and found it quite entertaining, but a few nights ago I watched it again, and completely fell in love! the movie is packed full of comedy, action, romance, and a whole wack-load of other fun stuff. it starts with William, a peasant, talking to Roland, his long time friend, about the passing of their Sir that they were aiding in his jousting. Will decides to take Sir. Hectors place and discover a way to 'Change his stars'. of coarse action isn't the only thing amazing about this movie... they do through in a romance. Will falls in love with the lovely Lady Jocelyn as soon as he see her. It's quite easy to forget that this movie is based in mid evil times, because the story is written with slag and the same kind of humor we enjoy today. I find it very creative that Brian chose to use old rock music to match with the film.. another aspect making it much different from other mid evil films. My favorite scene is definitely 'Golden Years'. The dance is riviting. I love the technique and rhythm put into the routine. Heath Legder really found a way to capture the essence of the character. His maturity in the film is definitely impressive. It was refreshing to see him in another comedy, such as 10 things I hate about you. Its very witty as well, Geoffery Chauncer, the writer, was written quite well into the plot. The movie reflects the book he wrote. the movie is supposed to be based on his 6 month dissapearence. I find this movie simply delightful.",A Knight's Tale

This is a pure escapist fantasy and it is worth every penny of the admission price. The critics who rate it low just DON'T GET IT.It's funny, it's sweet, it's tense, it's beautiful.

426,goodtime,Fairly Solid Tale (possible spoilers),7,29 April 2001,"A surprisingly well written, well made movie with a bad habit of (intentionally) not taking itself seriously enough.  Unfortunately there are a lot of modern day references which ruin any sort of internal consistency within the story.  One would almost believe that the director is going for a new genre of film... like Titus, for instance, which takes a medieval storyline (and dialogue) and adds all sorts of modern props and scenery. But it doesn't work quite as well here, leaving a slight taste of ""lowest common denominator"" to think that they just wanted to get the kids into the theatres.  It's really a fun film, to tell you the truth, despite the silliness.  It's good enough that I hope most people can overcome the flaws, but that I also wish that it had been better.",A Knight's Tale
427,kimmer8100,Could have been such a good movie,1,27 May 2001,"This movie could have been so much more, but instead, they probably ""dumbed"" down the original script to appeal to teenage audiences and also thought that they could ride on the coat tails of the success of ""Shakespeare in Love"" by including Geoffrey Chaucer.  This would have been such an incredible movie if they hadn't included all of the ""modern"" fashions, speech, and customs.  Newsflash: You can still get audiences to go to a movie even if it seems old-fashioned.  Good movies seem hard to find lately with the release of such idiotic films like ""Saving Silverman"", ""The Adventures of Joe Dirt"", and ""Freddy Got Fingered.""  Look at how much money ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" made or, yes, ""Shakespeare in Love.""

430,destruct-3,It could have been so good,4,17 June 2001,"It's really a shame about this movie. There was certainly potential for something really good here. The acting was bad, the dialog was worse, and the cinematography made it all seem contrived. Having said that, I will say that the story itself was decent and there was some good humor. The Chaucer role was outstanding, and went a long way to save this from being supremely bad.  My only real beef with the story itself was that he ends up with Jocelyn. Her poorly-acted, badly-scripted part aside, she wasn't worth the time of day. [END SPOILER ALERT]The music was an interesting factor in this movie. I was intrigued at the use of modern music in this setting. As the movie went on, it lost some of its appeal due to less-than-stellar song choices, but I can understand that it's not an easy pairing to pull off.As for the cinematography, it felt to me like they were trying much too hard to be Gladiator. There were some nice long shots, but particularly during the tournament scenes (which I did enjoy, all in all) it was evident that they only had one camera trick to try to convey the chaotic action. I think that this is the largest obstacle to this film retaining any value over time.Acting and dialog, well, what can be said? I don't have a problem with cheesy love stories, and with those generally come some bad dialog, but it's usually bad in the sappy way. In this case, it was more toward unimaginative. I suppose it's not necessarily fair to condemn both the acting and the dialog, as it can be difficult to distinguish in which area the failure occurred.Bottom line, it just doesn't make the grade for me. The tournament scenes, humor, and love story aren't enough to overcome the fundamental flaws in the production of the film. We can see that Will has heart, but it's practically written on cue cards and held up for us to see rather than shown by character development. If you don't mind parting with the cash, a single viewing will at least be somewhat entertaining. I would say this might be a good bring-the-kids movie, except that I wouldn't want them to get the idea that this is how love is supposed to work. :)4/10",A Knight's Tale

Seriously, I think you need to get out a bit more.Anyway, to all of those who have seen it and, well at least thought it was okay, and to those that should see it; this is a great movie. The comedy is brilliantly written and the actors pull it off amazingly. Heath Ledger plays William Thatcher who is a squire for a knight named Sir Ector (Nick Brimble). The other squires and his friends are Mark Addy who plays Roland and Alan Tudyk who plays Wat. Cutting things short Sir Ector passes away and William becomes a knight. However without noble birth this is not possible. This is where they meet the brilliant Paul Bettany playing Geoffrey Chaucer who renames William Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein of Gelderland. There is as always a love interest involved between William and Jocelyn played by the beautiful Shannyn Sossamon and Williams rival Count Adhemar of Anjou played by Rufus Sewell.

The writing was cheesy and predictable, and for the most part, the characters were mediocre. The exceptions were Chaucer and Count Adhemar, who did very well as witty comic sidekick and detestable villain, respectively. The love story which accompanied the jousting action was at times excruciating; maybe if I were about 14 years old I would have liked it a lot better(?). Overall, I am glad I saw it.

Without spoiling any surprises, touches such as the Nike armour, the build up to the court dancing to David Bowie's ""Golden Years"", and the football chants at the tournament were brilliant.It's also a film I would see again to appreciate what I missed the first time - can't wait for the video!

Of course, that was when I had gone in expecting a film like Braveheart or The Patriot, with real historical lessons.  A Knight's Tale was nothing like either of those. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you.  The humor is, yes, cheesy at times, (the Nike armor) but I still laughed.  Chaucer was great, the villain was definitely evil, and the jousting/action scenes were very well done.

449,colindmcdonald,"Well, it is allegorical...",9,22 November 2019,"For 10+ years I've shown this film after my senior English students study the Canterbury Tales. Chaucer makes more than a casual appearance, after all. And every year it is one of the students' favorites...or, at least in the last 3-4 years, it keeps them off their phones and focused on something literary. First of all, it's fun. Tense, dangerous jousting scenes with the thunder of horse hooves and chants of raucous crowds? If for nothing more, kids buy into that, so the more meaningful elements might creep in. Second, it suggests where Chaucer got the ideas for his 30+ characters in the Tales. Jocelyn is NOT the Wife of Bath but her demand upon William is certainly WoBish. Geoffrey's ""indebtedness"" to the Summoner and Pardoner explains why those two are anathematic. The ""true and perfect gentle knight"" must be the fictitious William further fictionalization. Winning a bet on the Paris tournament provides the money for Chaucer to write full time. It goes on and on but these are low-hanging Canterbury Tales fruit, and most of the kids get it. Finally, the shift in social paradigm-to one where a (wo)man can change his/her own stars-is implicitly painted: Adhemar's world crumbles as he lies flat on his back with the five stars of the film leaning in to pronounce judgement and AC/DC swirls in the background. Which leads to an explanation of the extraordinary soundtrack-a major, anachronistic objection for so many reviews. Queen, BTO, War, Bowie, et. at., exquisitely dovetail the shift only too jarringly if you've missed the allegory of realigned values.",A Knight's Tale
450,potatosoup,I had more pleasure making fun of this movie then I did watching it.,1,2 May 2001,"I'm just glad I saw it for free. I'd rather shoot myself in the foot than sit through another two hours watching this horrible piece of work. I admit that I think Heath Ledger is pretty hot, but not even his wild good looks could save this film. The acting was horrible, the 70's rock 'n' roll sound track got more laughs than the jokes and the plot is never ending. The costumes were well done, the mix of using new fabrics and variations in the style of the period was an interesting choice, but even they could not justify the 70's musical choice. Please, I beg of you, save your seven dollars and go buy a book.",A Knight's Tale
451,tracytoad3008,Wonderful cast - lovely actors. Just easy fun watching.,10,21 July 2006,"If you are after something historically correct then this is not the film for you. Its A Knights Tale but with a modern twist. The actors are superb - especially Heath Ledger, Paul Bettany & James Purefoy - but you really cannot fault any of them. OK so you know what the ending is going to be like - but what is wrong with that. The story leading to it, is beautifully shot, superbly set to music & so refreshing.Its wickedly funny too - you need to watch right up until the credits have finished too. In a time when there are countless films graphically showing rape, murders and gratuitous violence, its refreshing to see directors/producers & film companies that are still prepared to bring us such magical films as this one.Enjoy it.",A Knight's Tale

The cast is great, the story is goofy fun, but the MUSIC... if the songwriters could only see to believe. The screenplay is simply great. Jousting will never be the same!",A Knight's Tale
454,share_bear,"Enter the theater with an open mind, and you'll leave seeing a very original movie.",8,30 April 2001,"I have to admit that I was unsure what to think immediately following the opening sequence when the audience at the jousting match broke into a Queen song.  It seemed a little strange, but I opted to give the film the benefit of the doubt. If you're a historical traditionalist, this may not be the film for you.  But if you have a sense of humor and an understanding of pop culture, you will most likely enjoy yourself.Heath Ledger was wonderful helming the movie with a virtually unknown supporting cast; his performance will certainly land him on several studio must-have lists.  The story itself had several simultaneous plots in addition to the jousting scenes -- which were awesome!  The film is funny, clever, adventurous and genuine -- not to mention having a killer soundtrack.  I particularly liked the storyline involving his father.  Enter the theater with an open mind, and you'll leave seeing a very original movie.",A Knight's Tale
455,Rgar767619,"Definitely not for medieval purists, but a lot of fun!",8,2 May 2001,"I just saw the movie last night at a sneak preview, and I must admit I was pleasantly surprised! I was kind of hesitant, judging by the previews, since I usually jump at the chance to see more ""traditional"" medieval/knightly movies. I was unsure about the use of modern music and dialogue. I was also worried that the jousting scenes might be a little repetitive. However, neither concern arose while I watched the movie. It was a funny and heroic adventure, and I enjoyed myself. I plan on taking some other friends to see it in the future. Yes, the court dancing scene in which they suddenly begin dancing to David Bowie's ""Golden Years"" was great. And the character of Geoffrey Chaucer (yes, THAT Chaucer) as ""Ulrich's"" herald was hysterical!",A Knight's Tale
456,zenofpiglet,Awesome adventure that will Rock You!,10,2 May 2001,"I had the privilege of seeing this great movie in a sneak preview, and it was excellent.Be prepared for a fun approach with plenty of artistic license.
This movie is a parody of sorts, but not too much of one to be labeled as such by the critics I would think. Strong hints of Gladiator show up later on in the movie, helped along by the fact that the villain (Rufus Sewell) looks a little like Phoenix from Gladiator.  The audience I was with chuckled at the opening scenes containing the theme song ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen... it takes on a slightly modern perspective, likely to keep things fresh and different.The post-tournament dinner & dancing scene also uses a bit of modern artistic license, and is great fun to watch. The leading lady (Shannyn Sossamon) is a newcomer, and does a fine job. She certainly fueled the romance spark between herself and Thatcher (Ledger), and never hesitated to put on a strong performance. You will also fall in love with the two side-kicks and the blacksmith,   Mark Addy, Alan Tudyk and  Laura Fraser.Heath Ledger is of course handsome as he is intended, so the girls already get their part covered. The action is also always a couple of steps ahead of what the audience is expecting, so it was always a delight to see what came next.I'm not sure how else I can explain the movie except that it was a fun action filled comedy, with a splash of romance. Paul Bettany plays Chaucer, and a wonderful Chaucer at that. My husband believes he'll take me to see the movie again just to see this fantastic and very funny performance by this actor we've never heard of before. Please do go see it, even for the full fare I'm sure you'll have a good time.Enjoy!",A Knight's Tale

A predictable, historically inaccurate, boring, mindless, mind-numbing, waste of money and time.  Watching grass grow would be more entertaining.  The characters are not well developed, in fact the 'HERO' is truly an arrogant ass with whom you have no sympathy for.  The 'Heroin' seems more like the loser's curse than the winner's prize.  The pathetic attempt to lighten the movie by superimposing modern pop-culture is shameful and destroys whatever value the movie might have held.

I like these songs in and of themselves but not intertwined with a medieval themed movie. Seems they are trying to sell this movie to MTV viewers and fail horribly, nothing rips you out of a period piece like the king singing we will rock you right before a joust. If your a fan of these types of movies this one will annoy you to no end. Trust me this is no Excalibur, Kingdom of Heaven or even like the recent release King Arthur if you like any of these movies mentioned this movie will simply tick you off.Lame concept that kills the entire idea of the movie avoid at all costs.",A Knight's Tale

463,DasBuki,It would be tough,2,7 July 2007,"to contrive a movie much more worthless than this endeavor. I'll quote my girlfriend to summarize: ""The best part of the movie is when you fast-forwarded the remaining 45-minutes and narrated to me the old, tired storyline that we knew would unfold based on the first five minutes."" I could not agree with her more. Couple this reality with uninspired acting, garbage writing, and an embarrassing failure to integrate modern music into medieval scenes and we were left with a wasted evening.The only saving grace was that I was able to rent it in Blu-Ray format thus conclusively demonstrating yet again that one simply cannot polish a turd.All this being said: God bless America. $118-million global gross on a $65-million budget. Gross profit = $53-million. Though I am troubled trying to understand how $65-million was spent. Regardless, some genius got rich(er) off a complete joke.",A Knight's Tale

I think that the comic relief was refreshing, thrown in with the seriousness of the plot and the romance of the story kept me on the edge of my seat.

The movie gets really good after the first half hour of it. I thought I wouldn't like this movie and my friend dragged me to it because I don't like adventure but it ended up being comedy.

""A Knight's Tale"" turned out to be a first-rate fairy tale.  I can only speculate on what could have possibly earned the PG-13 rating.  There was no profanity, no explicit sex. The only nudity was a point of comedy.  The cast were beautiful and the story inspiring.  The action was believable, and the plot was plausible. The soundtrack was ridiculously anachronistic, of course; but the songs' relevance to the plot was positively poetic.  Is there such a thing as hyper-poetic?

I do admit that the music in the film isnt very realistic for the time but it just seems to fit the story. Heath Ledger is a peasant turned knight , falls in love, and must try to defeat the evil knight. Its not that deep of a story it does have its touching moments though. Mostly involving Heath's character father.  The jousting scenes are amazing and the humor is pulled off pretty well also. Mostly because of The Knight's two buddies.

It works.""A Knight's Tale"" has action, romance, and yet is weird enough to entertain everybody who's not too fond of the usual knight-in-shining-armour flicks. Speaking of shining...

When I first watched I though oh my god how can this be done, its mocking history. I still think so but the movie doesn't attempt to be realistic, it does well what it sets out to do, its a story about unconditional honor, its about giving everything up for honor and respect. I truly liked the movie when I watched it a second time, it made me think about how nowadays people do not care about honor, things like having a good time at all costs and raking up cash and things are more important, but there is no honor in that. I watched the movie with my sister and she didn't like the main character because he was willing to choose honor over being with someone he loved, over living peacefully and quietly on a farm. She didn't understand it, the problem is that these days people don't understand why one would do something like that and thats sad. If people cared more about honor, life would be much better for everyone",A Knight's Tale

It is the story about a squire, William (Heath Ledger) who wishes to participate in jousting tournaments. This is not possible since only noble men can participate. However, through an unfortunate accident, William takes the opportunity to (secretly) joust in his master's place...hoping to one day become a full-fledged knight.The movie's soundtrack is the ONLY part of the movie I didn't care for. It is loaded with 80's music, to which I try not to listen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy/adventure.",A Knight's Tale

When I say it is ""bad"", I mean that by all rights it should have been bad- emphasis on ""should have been"". There is no historical accuracy. Jousting matches take place with Queen music from the seventies blaring in the background. The leading lady wears clothes that Jackie O. would not have looked out of place in. Geoffrey Chaucer is portrayed as a washed-up writer with a gambling addiction. It really, really should have sucked. But it didn't. Now, why didn't it suck? I'm not really sure. Maybe it was the light-heartedness of it all. Maybe it was because the retro music, while being incredibly out of place, kind of fit. Maybe it was because the actors looked like they weren't taking themselves so seriously- and having fun in the process. Or maybe I just like seeing Paul Bettany half-naked, playing a hilarious part hilariously well. Most likely it's the last one. So, all that's to say: A Knight's Tale is funny and heart-felt. Yes, in places it is slightly cheesy. But so are nachos, and many people enjoy those regularly. Think of this movie like comfort food: It's no five-star meal, but something about it is so unassuming and familiar that you can't help liking it.Gah. Now I've made myself hungry.

And out of all of his films that i have seen of his, this is by far the best! As a matter of fact out of all the films i have seen period, A Knight's Tale is the best! The fact that it has Heath staring in it makes it a billion times better. I absolutley love the way the music fits so well with this modern movie that just happend to be set hundreds of years ago. ""A Knight's Tale"" could have been about anything and it still would have been my favorite. The casting was magnificant. There was not one word that didn't have to be used in the skript. The atctors were amazing at really making the part come from their own personality. That is what is so great about acting; if you are good enough, everything comes straight from who you are. Not one of the characters in A Knight's Tale could have been replaced... especialy Heath Ledger! I just wanted to say that if you have not seen this movie you need to go see it! No matter who you are or what type of movies you like or don't like i promise that this story will capture your mind and soul, and you will go home and i promise you will still be thinking about it.

The filming was great,some shot where absolutely fabulous and so was the acting.Heath Ledger proved again that he is more than a good looking guy and that acting is his talent above everything but of course all the others made this film very nice and good to look at.and although I was crying from all the laughing some moments I had to grab a handkerchief.I also want to congratulate the scriptwritters for such a lovely textes.But above all i love the femenestic views and spirits from'Jocelyn'!",A Knight's Tale
496,yanoula,the most fun I've had at the movies for AGES,10,26 September 2001,"I went to this movie prepared to enjoy it because, lets face it, Heath Ledger is a spunk, but I didn't realise it would be one of the coolest movies I have ever seen. A perfect blend of farce and action, it is great to see a movie that doesn't take itself seriously but somehow still keeps you hanging on to see what happens next. The surprise star (sorry Heath you were great AND cute but...) is Paul Bettany who plays Chaucer - brilliant!!!!! I laughed till I had a tummy ache and even shed a tear or too. If you see nothing else this year, you must see A Knight's Tale",A Knight's Tale
497,Myna,Be Still My Heart!!,10,30 March 2002,"This is one of the GREATEST movies that I have ever seen!! Every character is full and complete all the way from William the the lowliest squire. The HONOR that is portrayed in this movie is magnificent.  I believe that today's world is greatly lacking honor and when a movie can remind us so beautifully what honor is like, what honor is all about and what the significance of honor is I say BRAVO!! Thank you to Heath Ledger and the rest of the cast for BRILLIANT performances!  OH, last but not least the music is AWESOME!!!!!",A Knight's Tale
498,whd,Excellent romp,9,7 October 2001,"A dull rainy Sunday afternoon - whats to be done?  Got to the movies of course.  A Knights Tale, always tongue in cheek, was excellent fun for both sexes based on a wide ranging survey of,er, two. It retains all the morals one would expect from a knightly tale, a nasty cheating baddy and an honourable hero, but puts it all in a modern style. Don't go expecting Gladiator 2 set in medieval times but do go expecting a great time and the boy getting the girl.",A Knight's Tale
499,kellycraymer,WOW!!! He's sooo sexy!,9,11 October 2001,"Well to be honest my main attraction to the film was Heath Ledger,But saying that,i do like  historic type films,i.e in my collection you will find,""First Knight"",""Braveheart"",""Legend's of the Fall"" e.t.c. I really liked the way it was set in an historic period but had the up to date music and dancing,i just think it was well put. The effects and fight scenes were pretty cool and it made a nice change to have a happy ending! All in all it's a film to buy on video and the bonus is.....Heath Ledger",A Knight's Tale
500,abe-4,A pleasant surprise.,8,13 October 2001,"I'd like to recommend this movie to anyone who feels like a bit of a lift. Plenty of laughs and the music is great.Having no preconceived notion about this movie I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained. The actors faces were so good to look at and the setting was natural to the point of being almost ordinary and this came as a shock after seeing similar settings 'Hollywood style'.  It even has a plot and a real cool villain but I guess it's the Aussie, Heath Ledger, who carries the show. Apart from the violence of Medieval games that might be a bit too strong for young children, this is a feel good movie that wouldn't offend anyone.",A Knight's Tale
501,sandras_mejl,A great love story!,10,18 October 2001,This movie is one of the best of it's kind! I love a true love story and that I got in this movie :)I can recommend this movie to all people who love a romantic story in the medieval times.A great movie!,A Knight's Tale
502,sirl4nc3lot,Quite Good medieval Film,8,12 November 2001,"I saw the film yesterday evening, and it was quite good. There was something too much fake, something ancient shuffled with something modern that in my favor was not necessary, and the story was not so original, but at the end... it was a good film. If you like the Medieval Centuries, you can't loose this film.",A Knight's Tale
503,garak67,Love the Music,10,23 November 2001,"This film is what movies should be about.  Forget about deep meaning, just sit back and enjoy some tongue in cheek humor.  Help me forget about my day to day worries. Doesn't hurt if you like classic rock music either.",A Knight's Tale
504,janwillembol,This movie was great,10,4 December 2001,"Hi there!This movie was great!! I watched it in a cinema in Arnhem. And uhm, I've got 1 word for it: FANTASTIC!! The humor, the characters, the armors! Everything was great. I don't know if you have seen The Gladiator, but this is also very great. The only difference is, that the hero of the story stays alive!!
Well, you have to watch it, it's just great!!",A Knight's Tale
505,paradoxial,"Enjoyable, though odd.",10,1 December 2001,"Although I expected this movie to be a major flop, I was convinced to see it besides my previous opinions. And, for once, I was very pleasantly surprised. It seemed a very unique mix between modern day and medieval times without being totally ridiculous. The first few scenes are a little sloppy, but they get the setting of the scene done with very early on. From there, the story develops quite well, giving the illusion of many old cliches but still managing to surprise you again and again. Although some story parts were a little dry, the jousting was by no means the only draw to this movie. The scenes with Chaucer were quite funny, and William was actually quite well developed.All in all, a very good film.",A Knight's Tale
506,frla,Pretty ok but cut out the modern music!,4,16 December 2001,A pretty nice movie. It wont find it's way to my DVD collection but it was ok to see once. The most stupid thing was to incorporate modern music into it. We will rock you in the middle ages? Get real! And the dance that turns into modern music... ehmm... don't the director have any sence of reality?,A Knight's Tale

509,kcrock,What a pleasant surprise.,10,7 February 2002,"This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I've never been crazy about movies like I thought this was going to turn out to be. What a pleasant surprise.I do think it takes a certain amount of intelligence or level of mentality to understand and appreciate the humor behind this movie. I think if you haven't enjoyed it, you just didn't get it.I'm pretty particular about the movies I watch and even pickier about the ones I purchase. We have paid to watch this movie several times and intend to purchase this movie and add it to ""Our Favorites"".",A Knight's Tale

A Knights Tale is great guy movie but chicks will like too. An outstanding blend of midi-evil jousting and contemporary music. A little romance to make the girl your watching with happy. A great father and son reunion that will bring tears to the eye of the toughest guy. A classic good verses evil, an essential in any story of conflict. Endowed with great cast of likable interesting characters and some mighty fine looking horses . All topped off with the best stunt work I've seen in years. This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Rick Larkin",A Knight's Tale
511,dgb-3,How do they get funding for such dross,1,10 March 2002,I cannot believe that Hollywood is still prepared to invest so muchmoney (and skills) in producing films with so little content. The story is weak and hackneyed - the acting indifferent - thecasting largely idiosyncratic. One again the technical expertise isup to the usual high standards but the film as a package hasnothing going for it. Once again a great disappointment from Hollywood.,A Knight's Tale
512,james-267,Lance-a-little!!,1,11 March 2002,Although a comedy (of sorts) and a historical story (not hysterical though) this film didn't really  work as either.  What could have been a rip roaring hoot seemed to get so caught up in itself that it ended up rather lame - to the extent that I really couldn't have cared less what was going to happen at the end at all. It is also rather insulting to see American actors taking supposed English roles and doing nothing to disguise the fact that they are American. (was there a dialogue coach?) I'm sure that doesn't usually happen when Brits take parts in American films. A missed opportunity.,A Knight's Tale
513,mickey0320,Rags to Riches twist in medieval time period with a modern sound,10,27 November 2007,"A Knight's Tale is one of the best films of 2001. It conveys the fact that we are all in charge of our own destiny. The lead character, William, played by Heath Ledger, was born on the ""wrong side of the tracks"" and wishes for nothing more than to be a knight. When William learns the fate of his liege, he coerces his fellow squires into helping him guileful his destiny of becoming a knight. William soon becomes Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein, from Gelderland with his trusty squires wins match after match with his sword and jousting abilities. Sir Ulrich is not without enemies, Count Adhemar (Rufus Swell) finds him an unworthy and will do everything to disgrace him on and off the field. Another great part of this movie is the music, with its modern day sound it keeps glued to the screen to see what will happen next. This is definitely one movie that should be on everyone's ""TO SEE"" list.",A Knight's Tale
514,chellebell72,Great movie!,10,9 October 2002,"I've read some of the comments on this movie(sorry, don't have time to read 400 of them).  This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously.  It's a good fun movie.  I absolutely love this movie.  I've watched it many, many times. Yes, I have found little things about it, but I overlook them.  They are not enough to change my opinion about the whole of the film.
Heath Ledger gave a wonderful performance.  He had me choked up at times(his face when his blind father walked to him).  Give him time, he'll be a wonderful actor.  The supporting actors were perfect for their parts.  I have recommended this movie to alot of people, and they have all liked it.",A Knight's Tale
515,gal_unge,This movie rocks your ass!,9,10 February 2008,"I absolutely disagree with most of you! I found the intro, where the peasants rocks to ""we will rock you"", to be absolutely wonderful! When I saw this movie for the first time I though, unlike most of you guys, ""ha-ha this is going to be a hilarious movie!"" (in a good way!) And it was! The movie was a very entertaining movie with lots of humor! And loads of: ""ha-ha! sweet!"" It's not a Pulp in any way, but you don't expect that either. And about those comment about it not to be a historical correct film. It's for entertaining, not a historical documentary! What do you guys expect?? It's not a very deep movie, but has it's moments. I found this movie to be one of the movies you can watch over and over again! Please enjoy! It's a movie you will love!",A Knight's Tale
516,starwarsluvr,Phenomenal movie! (itty bitty spoiler),10,17 February 2008,"Yes, I know. Edward wasn't called the Black Prince until after his death; they didn't joust with plate armour until about 100 years later; they didn't technically have to be noble, they just had to have the money to compete; Chaucer never walked around naked and they never rocked out or did the wave. But really, this film doesn't have to be accurate to be good! If you overlook all the inaccuracies, then you laugh so hard you can't breath. I watched this film last night with my friend, and fell completely in love with it. Ledger, Bettany, Fraser, Addy and Tudyk were so smooth with each other you feel like they have been friends and comrades for years. Sewell is so unsettling, that every time you see him you just want to duck under a blanket; you can never tell what he is going to do next. Sossamon is the only one I really was lukewarm about. Don't get me wrong, she was and is still a very good actress. I just felt that next to the other cast (especially Ledger, Bettany and Sewell), she paled a little bit. And yes, the plot was a little confusing and unexplained sometimes. But the comedy, drama, romance, and hysterical sports references made up for it. This isn't a movie that really truly makes you contemplate life and all its meanings. Yes, it does have messages (honor, love, loyalty), but they are right there on the surface (for the most part; Jocelyn's request and William/Ulrich's eventual acquiescing to losing the joust really touched me, I thought it truly showed his feelings for her). But it wasn't made to be deep. It was made to be entertaining. And it accomplishes that with shining armour. P.S. Please excuse whatever spelling mistakes I may have made. It's late, and I'm tired ;-)",A Knight's Tale

518,Medexstar,One of the best movies I've ever seen.,10,2 November 2008,"When I first saw the cover (yes I know, don't judge it by its cover... but still), I had an instinct to not watch it, however I had no other movies to watch, so I reluctantly sat down with my family... and it took me by complete surprise.The powerful and surprising opening got me into the mood of the movie very fast, and a lot of humors throughout it too. I loved the use of music (it's what entertains us. If the director used some old medieval music, I would have fell asleep very soon), and cheesy jokes, but it all worked out perfectly.I just don't understand all the negative reviews of this movie. Sure, it may be clichéd, but this is a FAIRY TALE for heavens sake. It's meant for young viewers to enjoy, and families to watch. Clichéd indeed, but in other times emotional and enjoyable. Without the clichés, the movie would be dull and boring, and it would be twisted in a way like the new Batman movie, which is ideal for adults, but confuses many teenagers and kids. Plus, it would be too much of a 'serious' movie if it had not many clichés in it.All I'm saying is, this movie is all about simplicity, and entertains you by its basic structure and story-line, however it entertains you nevertheless!",A Knight's Tale
519,daca9317,It's one of the best movies I´ve seen!,10,29 November 2002,Its a really good familymovie and I recommend it to people in all ages. It has a good story and it show us how unfear the life could be and that love is blind.,A Knight's Tale
520,antdege,Hilarious with a little bit of serious adventure as well.,8,24 March 2009,"This movie has been one of my personal favorites since it was released on my birthday years ago. Now aside from my personal liking of it I truly feel it was a great film due to the anachronisms included in the film that allow it to be comical as well as adventurous. The lack of a serious nature in a medieval setting is something that is not seen very often and makes this film enjoyable and humorous. The opening scene when the crowd sings ""we will rock you"" at a jousting tournament gives you a great first impression of what the movie is truly like, a movie taking place in medieval times with modern elements. The jousting scenes are also somewhat impressive and add another side to the story besides the comedic nature brought in by the modern elements. Chaucer's appearance is classic and throughout the movie brings constant laughs. Overall I found this movie to be truly interesting and funny.",A Knight's Tale
521,ginga_ninga8,great film!!!,8,17 May 2009,"After reading the review of the person before me, i approached this film cautiously. I expected the historical incorrectness to annoy me and to ruin my view of the film... i was wrong. This film is great and has turned out to be one of my 'desert island five' that i could watch again and again. Its filled with charm and has many great one liners which always make me laugh. It is definitely worth watching. In the film one thing heavily annoyed me, and that is the disrespect shown to their dead master at the start of the film... at the time it seems funny, but later on in the flashback to young William he treats young Will with nothing but kindness when he is clearly scared, a film filled with as much charm as this shouldn't make Will oversee the mans kindness and just strip him of his clothes and leave him to die. Anyway apart from that the film is greatly enjoyable and fun for all of the family, watch this film!!!",A Knight's Tale

523,ndstokes,very witty,9,21 June 2010,"The anachronistic details in this movie are what make it so entertaining. The music, the crowds singing along, the costumes, the make-up, the 'logos' on Will's armor, even the painted coat of arms on the Black Prince's leather jacket: just excellent! If you look really closely you can even see a medieval version of the London Eye portrayed in the distance as the view closes in on the jousting field for the final contest. Very cleverly done, and highly under-rated! It's ren-faire history with a lot of Chaucer gags thrown in for good measure. Highly entertaining. My favorite part was the Gel-der-land chant: it totally completed the football-theme (if you notice the England-style football jersey-ish costumes on the pages in the intro to the final sequences, then you're catching the humor). Nice. Very cheeky.",A Knight's Tale
524,wtburnette,Fun to watch,8,29 July 2003,"Yes, I agree that the love scenes are nothing special, but this is a fun movie to watch anyway.

What's not to like?",A Knight's Tale
525,bhirschi42,More accurate than you might think,9,15 August 2003,"The first time I saw A Knight's Tale (on cable, missed it in theater), I had the same reaction as many of you - Queen? David Bowie? In a movie set in the middle ages?But I stayed with it, and I'm glad I did. Once you get past the glaring anachronisms (put in the film on purpose, of course), you find the movie is actually quite true to its period.The presence of Chaucer in the film, combined with some of its details, leads me to suspect that Brian Helgeland has read ""Chaucer's Knight"" by fellow filmmaker Terry Jones (of Monty Python fame). The book deconstructs the knight in Chaucer's ""The Knight's Tale"" in a totally unique way -- he is seen NOT as the flower of medieval chivalry (as most scholars have interpreted him), but as a mercenary out for nothing but money and blood. The character in the film Chaucer would have written about, then, is not Sir William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), but Count Adhemar of Anjou (Rufus Sewell).The part of the film in which this connection ""clicked"" for me was the scene where Count Adhemar is called away to his command in a ""Free Company"" -- a particular stain on the reputation of knighthood which Jones talks extensively about in his book.Jones' book made use of extensive research into medieval history, and Helgeland's film obviously does, too.Chaucer was a master of satire in his day. Helgeland's use of modern conventions in a period film is a conceit of which - I believe - Chaucer would definitely have approved.I gave ""A Knight's Tale"" 9 out of 10 - it's not perfect, but I like it so much, I try to watch it every time it comes on (it's been on HBO and Cinemax pretty regularly for the past several months). Check it out!",A Knight's Tale
526,Shayde007,Great popcorn movie,9,1 September 2003,"I just have to stop and laugh when i read comments accusing this movie of being historically inaccurate. People who have judged it and dissected it that way have totally missed the point of this movie, which is to just sit back and have a good time at the movies.This movie isn't trying to deliver some deep meaning or intense message, it is a light-hearted and very fun movie. It is a popcorn movie, and as far as popcorn movies got it just might be the best. This movie is very rewatchable and fun every time. 9/10",A Knight's Tale
527,ipwnfun,Fresh,7,18 December 2011,"A mere sixty years or so since the world was first graced with enduring classics like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone With the Wind"", it seems to some as if all that could be done on film, has been. Though this is the statement of a very closed mind with foolish assumptions, there is a point here to be considered. If so many great things have already been done, why should we feel the need to reinvent them? There are great ideas out there that can yet be exploited for wider audiences and in fresh, different, presentations. In something reminiscent of themes from movies such as ""Gladiator"" with the lighthearted takes of more pop culture oriented pieces, Brian Helgeland's ""A Knight's Tale"" makes for a fresh entertaining presentation of what we already know and love.The story revolves around William Hatcher (Heath Ledger), a knight's servant, who after finding his master dead just before a jousting competition, impersonates him to compete for the sake of his and his fellow squires' daily bread. Right from the get go the movie makes no effort to pass as anything too serious as one of the two other squires, Wat (Alan Tudyk), violently shakes the limp armor of his deceased master and uncontrollably yells at it in an almost mocked British fashion. In presenting the first competition, Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" plays as an excited crowd of dirty ragged peasants hypes up the upcoming joust. After William predictably fails the competition and goes through a purposefully awkward award ceremony, any notion of seriousness is stripped from the mind of the viewer, allowing for a more pleasant ride through some of the crude and almost poorly presented parts that follow.As we are taken on William's journey to fame and fortune, we find many commonplace themes, such as forbidden love, honor, and a villainous competitor. In pursuing the love of a lady of royalty, rather than taking an exceedingly romantic rout, we are faced with more humorous and ridiculous scenes such as some awkward dancing lessons, emotional group love note writing sessions, and a medieval ball to David Bowie's ""Golden Years"". Through the course of the movie, you do manage to grow fond of our hero here, and there manages to be a legitimately moving scene of the reunion of William and his blind father. There on after, the effectiveness of the more emotional scenes is left at a merely decent level as neither the acting nor over dramatized course of events aids the cause too much.With a clearance of critique and a slight sense of gullibility, one could possibly leave the movie with a sense of fulfillment through the drama and plot line of the movie, but really what is to take from this movie is the freshly humorous presentation of the whole thing. It is exciting to see the anachronisms and almost anti romantic aspects incorporated into this movie, making it for a great film to watch with a light heart on an easy day.",A Knight's Tale
528,grizzlymokus,It was a pleasant surprise and good fun.,8,13 January 2004,"I think that some of the comment writers take this movie too seriously. It is a comedy with lots of good and not so good jokes. I really like how it makes fun of today's professional sports like football, boxing, baseball, etc. Remember when the spectators are trying to catch that flying helmet? :-)The usage of scoring system in jousting is just brilliant. The World Championships is another great joke. The character of Chaucer is constantly amusing and the others are also great.I bought the movie on DVD for my wife for Xmas. I wanted to buy something romantic for her and I thought a ""knight's tale"" must be romantic and there is also some action for me to survive romance. To my pleasant surprise the movie was fun and we were laughing a lot.",A Knight's Tale

A joy to watch and has something for every family member: sword fights and jousting; dancing and poetry; good guys and bad guys; horses and well, more horses.

533,mikloskallo,This is ridiculous. And not funny.,1,20 August 2005,"This movie is simply terrible. It is acceptable for a movie which does not claim do be a documentary to handle historical facts with some liberty but the director transforms medieval tournaments into something like baseball matches. Geoffrey Chaucer dances right on the throne of England's future king. Scores are displayed with little flags. Unbelievable, really. I guess we can thank the director for omitting the cheerleader teams for each knight... It reminds me the sketch, where the Japanese director instructs Queen Elisabeth to sit on a bicycle instead of her throne. Only Monty Python meant it as a joke, for heaven's sake. This representation of the tournaments is stupid and pathetic. As for entertainment the movie fails badly. Stupid, unlikely and corny story, corny dialogs, terrible actors, corny spec. effects. The guy who wants to be a knight gets knighted. Who could have thought? There's one good point, though, the father's vision did not return at the end. It would have been a typical Hollywood grade nonsense. However it does not make the movie enjoyable.",A Knight's Tale
534,dp_kn_ox,THE Knight's Tale,8,7 October 2004,"Get your nappies off people! All the literary crap aside, this movie is a crack-up. The love story isn't really interesting, but the concept of the film is spot-on. It's such a tight film, with solid performances from the leads/lovers, high comedy from Chaucer and low from Wat, and a real message. When Will realises what he really is - a knight - you can't help but be drawn in to the adventure. The sets and extras are awesome (it was shot mostly in the Czech Republic), and Will's arch-rival has such depth as the villain.I think what really draws us into Will's quest is the way the director uses rock music and shoots the jousting like a football grand-final. If you think the whole rock thing is too much of an anachronism, think about if music used in other period films is any more appropriate. The music is a great way to bring the middle ages to the screen. The film is silly, but at least it doesn't take itself as seriously as other similar films. While it plays on the conventions done to death in more serious films, it's smart enough to know when to use them and does so so much more convincingly.To get a handle on Heath Ledger's acting style, see 'Two Hands' - a top Aussie film.I know that I said I'd forget the literary stuff, but how good are Peter the Pardoner and Simon the Summoner especially?",A Knight's Tale
535,lotajhal,Unhistorical fun,7,17 January 2006,"This film is not historical. This is made very clear in the first thirty seconds whilst medieval peasants stomp to Queen's ""We Will Rock You."" It's appeal lies in the fact that it feels like a Renaissance fair. The same kind of unhistorical historical atmosphere.The characters are great fun as well. Paul Bettany as Chaucer, and the historical details thrown in about him are lovely, and Alan Tudyk as a spastic squire is hysterical. The only downside is Shannyn Sossamon as Lady Jocelyn. It's a badly written and stupid role played by a mediocre actress. The result is that it's painful during every moment she spends on screen. Ultimately, this is a film for people who are laid back enough to realize that it's a fantasy dressed up as history, and who want to have some fun. Because that's definitely this movie's strong point, it knows how to have fun.",A Knight's Tale
536,Danny_kahn,Entertaining,9,3 February 2005,"This comment is to counter those who have issue with modern rock and other time problems being in this movie. This movie was designed to entertain. It was NOT a historical piece and nowhere does it claim to be one. This is the story of a boy who aspires to be more than what society set out for him. The movie uses odd references to history's great figures and humor to bring its story across to the viewer. So I say that, for those of you who cannot enjoy a piece of entertainment due to its well placed use of anachronisms, I strongly suggest you stay away from any of Shakespeare's works. (Not to say that this movie was on level with Shakespeare...) The makers of ""A Knight's Tale"" set out to entertain, and did so dutifully.",A Knight's Tale

538,lva1021,lots of fun,8,26 January 2005,"I'm an old doll but I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a drama; silly me! The characters are so engaging, the plot is traditionally heroic and the movie is humorous. Add great 1980's rock music and you have one fun-filled flick. At first I wasn't sure if I should rent this movie to watch since it seemed a bit young for my age group but I'm so glad I did! It's always good to branch out and try things outside what you think you might like or dislike. My friends and I have a Movie Nite every month and this is the movie of choice for January 2005. I'm sure that they will enjoy it as much as we did. Life is serious enough without having all your movies be dramas! Please rent/buy and enjoy!",A Knight's Tale
539,digbert,A true delight,8,16 September 2013,"This film has been criticised for having a thin plot, and also for having a somewhat anachronistic soundtrack. These are perhaps fair - not a huge amount happens to any of the characters beyond what you can glean from the tag-line and the music is the 'best of the 70s'. However that doesn't matter one bit. This is, and will always be, one of my top 10 films simply because it is just so damn fun to watch. Ledger is - as always - impressively watchable, but it is the supporting cast who truly make this film great. The ever-brilliant Tudyk is a scene stealer extraordinaire, and Bettany is just fantastic. It's a pity that Sossamon never truly achieved greatness in her career, but for me that just means she will always be the lovely Jocelyn - a feminist icon 600 years too early. Watch, and enjoy!",A Knight's Tale
540,OrangeJuiceBlues,This movie was very annoying,1,5 February 2005,"Heath Ledger is the typical underdog character, in this case a knight, surrounded by his bumbling assistants, trying to win a tournament that you will not care about, and trying to win the heart of a girl you will not care about. The story has no human/emotional value, the characters are just not very likable, and the dialogue is just stupid. I know it was purposefully supposed to be tongue-in-cheek and what not but the level of satire here is as about as subtle as a third rate Nickolodeon sketch comedy show such as ""All That"".The writers are of Saved By the Bell caliber. This movie is very annoying. Its attempts at being a cute, silly,""rock"" version of medieval times was a drain on my intelligence. Heath Ledger is a terrible actor, he basically reprised his persona from 10 Things I Hate About You, that persona being that he has no personality. Paul Bettany's ""comic-relief"" relieved only my bowels. Shannon Sosswhosits is a terrible actress, and the director was trying way too hard to achieve the ""so wacky you can't help but love it"" thing. Maybe little kids might think this was funny.",A Knight's Tale
541,guitargod-2,"A fun romp through the medieval ages, rock and roll style",10,12 April 2005,"From the opening credits with Queen's ""We Will Rock You"", to Thin Lizzy's ""The Boys Are Back In Town"" during the return to England for the world jousting championship, I laughed til it hurt. Casting was superb as the actors told the tale of William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), a peasant with dreams of becoming a Knight. The choice of Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer the writer was brilliant as were Alan Tudyk as Wat Falhurst and Mark Addy as Roland. They laughingly try to keep the illusion of William as Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein believable. The baddie Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) is attempting to retain his unbeaten status in the jousting tournaments, but is not certain he can keep beating the unorthodox style of William. So, he cheats, spies and does his best to discredit William as a Knight. The beautiful Shannyn Sossamon as the Lady Jocelyn showing wit and charm, teasingly draws William to her heart. But will William and his band of friends find love, glory and riches along the way? Watch this excellent movie to find out.",A Knight's Tale
542,averycook66,bad poop,1,28 November 2013,"A knights tale is not an effective film because of the non-convincing themes, non-period costumes not real feeling use of contemporary day elements. the non-convincing themes failed to keep me on the edge of my seat or emotionally attached at all. the reasons I say this are because Will never lost, the story seemed to make bigger holes than it was solving and he all of a sudden gets famous. The non convincing themes failed to keep me on the edge of my seat. The story felt like it was jumping around. An example of how it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat is how will never honestly lost a fight, so there was nothing to keep my attention, also there was no climax because of this. One instance where I felt like the story was jumping around Is at the beginning of the movie will looks like a 35 with dreadlocks but about 15 minutes in he looks 25 with short hair. All of this happened without any explanation. My favorite hole in the story is that will steals some armor then hes now the most famous knight in the world, And everyone knows his name and what he looks like. There were a lot of instances where I wasn't convinced that it took place in the medieval times because of the costumes. An example of this is when we would see Jocelyn she never seemed to be wearing something from england during the medieval times. It all seemed to be from Asia or something modern. The second example comes from when there are big groups of people. If you pay attention to what they're wearing all of them have running shoes on and the only period thing on is there shirt and maybe there pants. The last example happens throughout the movie. when you look at the actors most of the time all of them looked clean and like they had lots of makeup on, which obviously doesn't make sense if this is supposed to take place in the medieval times. They would more likely be dirty and with out makeup. When watching a knights tale I felt distant from the story i feel like they were trying too hard on things that didn't matter while leaving the important things like use of contemporary day elements alone to sort themselves out. For example at the beginning when the crowd starts singing ""we will rock you"" that kind of lost the time period magic for me. An example of the filmmakers not planning well enough is when they had big crowds I saw actors cheering when they weren't supposed to, talking to each other and looking at each other. My last example of why A knights tale did not capture my interest and felt like the filmmakers were forcing it is the soundtrack Queen, David Bowie, Eric Clapton and AC/DC. last time i checked none of those performers were born in the medieval times or even have a medieval sound. This is why I found that A knights tale isn't an effective movie because of the non medieval times costumes, the themes that didn't feel real and the bad use of contemporary day elements.",A Knight's Tale

545,mariposa39,"I must like it, I watch it again and again!",6,29 December 2007,"I'm into history and this is one of my favorite eras. Although this movie is hardly historically accurate, nor does it try to be, it does achieve the stereotype of British royalty wannabees, which I find delightful.I don't care for the rock music in the movie at all, I love rock music but it does have it's place. The music does make an effort to reach viewers who might otherwise not be interested in movies with an historic aspect.Heath Ledger and Alan Tudyk are both quite handsome, good choices for the leads. Together with diverse actor Mark Addy they make a most believable team, all three filled with interesting personalities and character.I understand that this was not supposed to be an historic fashion statement, but Jocelyn's clothes fell short of looking even remotely period, more like out of place. I preferred the worn out rags on the men to the fancy 1960s looking elegant fashionwear.Rufus Sewell played the antagonist quite well, regal and handsome, delightfully evil, yet had to be shown his place.I find this movie fun to watch, and in spite of it's drawbacks I keep coming back for more!",A Knight's Tale
546,nplace01,Not the best movie,3,10 May 2014,"To me, this movie has many issues. For starters, you can tell that the makers of A Knight's Tale were trying to make the main character as likable and similar to the audience, but it didn't make any sense at all because there is no way somebody would be just like a modern day person in the medieval times. This pretty much applies for all the characters. The plot, was all over the place. Also, the soundtrack was quite unoriginal. I can't think of anything that I liked about this movie. I wouldn't recommend it to someone that would get bothered by accuracy and all that stuff, but somebody who can overlook these things and doesn't take much seriously might enjoy it.",A Knight's Tale
547,tonychampion,Grreat fun!,8,2 September 2018,"Lots of silliness - such as Chaucer using Shakespeare's phrases, totally inappropriate Queen songs, and so on, make this film great fun! But there are some very touching moments, too. This is a very entertaining film.",A Knight's Tale
548,veronicapalm,A classic,10,14 August 2015,"Before reading this review, you should know that I am only slightly biased - this has been my favorite movie since I watched it for the first time, and Heath Ledger is one of my absolute favorite actors.That being said: This movie makes me laugh, it makes me cry, and it is overall a great laid-back action movie. There is some fighting, some emotion, and unfortunately some lines that could have been delivered a bit more sincerely. But it doesn't matter, because Heath Ledger delivers. He is 100% there, all the time, completely in character and brilliant. Like always. The soundtrack is cleverly enough modern, to show how people of that time felt about their music. There aren't a lot of Middle-age movies where you see the main characters dance to David Bowie and Queen! All in all, this movie will always be very special for me, and I hope I'm not mistaken when I say that this will be a future classic. If you haven't seen it, it's worth it. And if you have seen it, it's worth watching again.",A Knight's Tale
549,milan-korenica,Great comedy,9,4 June 2020,"When I first heard of this movie I thought, not another medieval themed movie. Then I've seen it and then I've seen it two more times at least.
This movie sets your expectation right off the bat when you see people on a medieval jousting arena clapping along to Queen's We will rock you. That's pretty much the tone the whole movie and it's a very fine balance between silly and serious.
Paul Bethany's Chaucer steals the show in almost every scene but especially during his first announcement which caught me completely off guard and which I adopted as a catchphrase for some time.
All in all a very watchable comedy drama, very with your time if you set your expectation right.",A Knight's Tale

551,prokax,the sweetest mix of all necessary ingredients for a good movie,10,17 July 2005,"The way they made it funny is surprising, but oh so predictable; Absolutely perfect! It is exciting but not too much so, a good love affair, which is not overdone, manly but not extremely so and thus definitely worth watching. This is a movie for families or for a quiet evening with your loved one. Kids will love it, as will any surviving hippies. The way real historic personages are mixed up with fictional characters increases the historical feel of the movie and provide an extra layer of humor to academics or enthusiasts of the period.

553,bking10,One of my favorite movies of all time!,10,6 August 2005,"I love that this quirky movie does not try to be a serious tale about life in medieval times. But rather, it has fun with the whole jousting scene - giving it a modern rock concert or sporting event feel - complete with face painting and at one point ""the wave.""Heath Leger plays a great character - male and completely confused by the woman he loves - but loves her anyways. These two main characters have a great chemistry - as exemplified in a great scene in Notre Dame (the church not the college). But my favorite part of this movie is the inter-personal relationships of the whole jousting troop. The characters are likable and realistic. There is a great sense of friendship and camaraderie that evolves throughout the whole movie.Excellent movie!",A Knight's Tale

Honestly, I have watched this movie repeatedly, for almost the twentieth time since it opened, and I have yet to be bored with it. This is one movie that you will have to watch more than once to completely and thoroughly understand every single joke and line in the dialogs. Every time I watch this movie, I come to a wider realization of what each line meant. And trust me, it is hilarious once you get it! Again, I shall repeat myself - the writing, impeccable. The dialogs - nothing short of fantastic. And of course, the fact that Heath Ledger is the leading man in this film does not harm its ratings one bit.",A Knight's Tale

To make the story better a love story, a story of young passionate courtly love. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an affinity for the Renaissance or likes the idea of someone getting thrown off a horse by the impact of a 10ft lance. The movie contains actors and actresses with great chemistry. The feel of the movie creates a warm and modern twist on the Renaissance. The soundtrack includes a great set of artists including Queen, David Bowie,Thin Lizzie, AC/DC, and a couple more. It's for sure one of the best movies of 2001.",A Knight's Tale
557,hsuvera,a fresh breath from the knight's tale,10,17 April 2006,"Have seen this film several times first in theater then in TV. Always feel relaxing and pleasant while watching. Though the story is simply knight+beauty=jousting+love but with the unexpected modern music-- ---I WILL ROCK YOU--- surprisingly acceptable and welcome.The stars are very young and very good, hardly find odds or disgusts. Just find out the leading actor is Heath Ledger of Brokeback Mountain, hardly identify these two -the young knight and the gay cowboy are the same person. Whether make-up or acting makes the differences? Of course there's 2 or 3 years away from the production year,but still feel quite astonishing.Back the film "" A knight's tale, though saw this film in different period of time through the years, still appreciate the story.",A Knight's Tale
