0,Leofwine_draca,Seen it all before,5,3 March 2018,"VERONICA is a somewhat overrated Spanish horror movie detailing a typical haunting/possession. It's set in 1991 and involves a teenage girl who meddles with a Ouija board and subsequently finds her apartment haunted by the spirit of her dead father. I saw this advertised as the scariest Spanish horror film since REC but it's a far cry from that zombie masterpiece. I found this inferior to most Japanese ghost stories, relying far too much on noisiness for effect: people running around screaming while the camera shakes, along with the usual jump scares and loud foreboding music. I much prefer a subtle, creeping dread to get across a real shivering kind of horror. This film is light on plot and rather predictable when it comes to the story, with only a stand-out couple of disturbing moments. The characters are rather unlikeable too.",Verónica
1,kosmasp,Decent but not special,6,16 February 2018,"So REC was really something special, but it was a collaboration between two directors. And I do have mad respect for the other one who had ""Nameless"" and ""Darkness"" already under his belt. So Paco here goes full horror with this and the end result is quite decent. It's not really anything new you get or that interesting (possession, demons and so forth).But it does work overall. So while it may not change your world view or shake your film world, it is something to watch, if you are into horror movies. There are quite some neat jump scares and the story has the right mood overall. The acting is also decent enough, it builds as expected and there is nothing much that is wrong with it. Except for its predictability I guess. So by the numbers, but better than off the rails",Verónica

3,paul_haakonsen,All the hype was just a diversion...,4,17 June 2018,"I had thought this movie to be a rather fantastic movie, because of all the great things I read and heard about it. Especially when people said that this was such a scary horror movie, that it was a disturbing movie.So it was with a lot of expectations that I sat down to watch ""Veronica"". And now that I have seen it, I must admit that this was a really mundane horror movie, and nowhere near the hyped up reviews that it had received.The ""Veronica"" movie offered nothing new to the horror genre, and it was so predictable even a blind man could keep up with it.The story was generic and not offering any intellectual challenges to the audience.The only strong points the movie had working for it, was the acting and the special effects.Stay well clear off this movie unless you have absolutely no other horror movies at hand.",Verónica
4,morrison-dylan-fan,"""It's not who you want to talk to,it's who you talk to.""",8,10 March 2018,"In the final days of the best of 2017 poll running on ICM,I started searching for movies to view for the final spots. A fan of the brutal Rec 1 and 2, (and shocked by how the ""Horror Comedy"" of Rec 3 sent the franchise on a downward spiral-all also reviewed)I was intrigued to find that co-director Paco Plaza had returned to the Horror genre. Crossing my fingers that Plaza had learnt from his mistakes on Rec 3,I prepared to meet Veronica.View on the film:Returning to feature films for the first time since Rec 3 in 2012,co-writer/(with Fernando Navarro) director Paco Plaza & cinematographer Pablo Rosso expand on the recurring, more subtle motifs featured in the first two Rec's,with Plaza and Rosso showing an impeccable eye for confined apartment buildings, with tracking shots following the demon spreading across the family apartment.Peculiarly not featuring an exorcism in a ""demon"" movie, Plaza elegantly uses startling images of a blind nun and discarded crosses to brew an atmosphere that any faith to defeat the evil,is hopeless.Whilst the use of a CGI demon for jump-scares sits ill at ease with the classical mood of the picture, Plaza gets the demon to embody Veronica's fears with excellent,in-camera trick-shots that reflect the horror that has been unleashed.Taken from the only crime in Spain where ""paranormal activity"" has been officially registered as a contributing factor in the case by the police report, the screenplay by Plaza and Navarro builds up the horror by cutting into Veronica's family, with a great, gradual examination of Veronica's need to take care of her siblings whilst mum makes ends meets at work,leading to the outbreak of the demon to strike at them in a ruptured state. Conjuring the challenge of playing the lead in her debut, Sandra Escacena gives an utterly marvelous performance as Veronica, thanks to Escacena giving a dramatic depth to the horror by pulling open the raw insecure and fearful nerves of Veronica.",Verónica
5,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Absolutely phenomenal Spanish supernatural effort,10,5 September 2018,"Called out to a woman's house, a veteran detective recounts the story of how a young schoolgirl and her friends playing with an ouija board suddenly caused an onslaught of supernatural activity to befall the girl and her family leading to a race against time to stop the deadly forces.For the most part, this one was a rather standout genre effort. Among it's better qualities is the fact that there's quite a prominent and profound supernatural aspect here that's grounded in reality rather nicely. The opening scenes of this, getting the quiet nature of their daily lives before the interruption of the supernatural with the girls playing with the ouija board in the hidden room. That sets this one off incredibly with the connection to the astronomy that was studied earlier in school and then turns into a creepy ouija-board game with the flickering lights, wildly-spinning planchette and the intermittent flashes to the blind nun at her school which then allows the game to take a darker turn with the spilled blood and sudden fire which provides this one with the hidden clues to the eventual possession later on. This, in turn, gives the film a fantastic grounding once it lets the supernatural elements through based on this strong setup. From the attack at home when an unseen force scalds the bathing brother under her care or a rather chilling breakfast sequence where it slowly dawns on her that something might be wrong with her. The most chilling aspect of this setup is the continued usage of the children's toy throughout the lighting up whenever something was nearby which is suitably highlighted in the stellar sequence against the children with her helpless to watch the oncoming spirit get closer through the shadows cast by the toy. Also featuring stellar blood-drenched hallucinations and plenty of strong psychological lead-ins, it prepares this nicely for the strong finale here. The finale is perhaps the film's strongest aspect, where it lets the wholesale supernatural antics out with abandon, which gives this a fun, wild time. With the opening seance letting it be known that there's something supernatural afoot with the situation as the children are shown to be targeted actively by the forces in the house, there's a lot of creepy moments here with the inability to recognize the danger of situation once the glass jar is utilized to signal the emergence of the spirit into our world begins chasing her through the house. This brings up plenty of strong supernatural highlights and utterly chilling revelations in a pretty shocking twist ending that gives this a fully enjoyable appeal that's quite entertaining. The other rather enjoyable element to be featured here is strangely the human drama at the center of the story. Since this one is going for the long-game approach of the possession gradually overtaking her, the setup here is marvelous at giving this a great atmosphere to set the supernatural antics within at a later time. This buildup from the character study into how it affects her, not only with the way her friends react but the behavior drives others around her to believe she's crazy which does have a profound effect on the different supernatural attacks present throughout here. The film might be a tad too long but that's about all that's really wrong here.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language, Violence, strong themes of children-in-jeopardy and underage drinking.",Verónica
6,trashgang,Spain did it again,7,21 March 2018,"I guess every horror buff will have heard or read an article about this so-called scariest film ever. I did and by reading that people ran out of theaters kept away from this flick. So many flicks are called best this or scariest that and mostly they are utterly trash. But hey, Netflix was brave enough to put this controversial flick on their list so I did watch it.Coming out of Spain I did had some expectations because good stuff in the genre did came out of that country for decades and being directed by Paco Plaza from REC (2009) expectations were high. And I must say that I would file it as a rather good horror flick. For me the ghost did work and some parts are indeed creepy but overall for a horror it's low on red stuff or even jump moments. What does work is the score used a throwback to those scary movies from the seventies and eighties. And the main lead being a fan of Héroes del Silencio did add towards the nostalgia.Of course when you have children as main lead it do gets you by the throat once they become possessed and doing so with the younger ones it do works. It isn't a slow builder and from the first minutes the horror do enters. Overall not bad but not one that you will remember years from now like REC did. Still, worth picking up if you are an old school horror geek or interested in the story itself, Veronica is based on a true story about the unsolved case of a young girl in Madrid in 1992 named Estefania Gutierrez Lazaro, who mysteriously died after using an Ouija board. Police were never able to crack their investigation.

7,deloudelouvain,Much fuzz about nothing.,5,3 April 2018,"These are the kind of reviews you will get when you hype up a movie and then you don't deliver. Like everyone else that saw trailers before I was expecting to watch one hell of a scary movie. It was supposed to be one of the scariest movies ever, people had to leave the theaters because they could just not handle it. Well that's complete bull if you ask me. The only reason I can see somebody leave the theater is to go to the bathroom and that's about it. I don't say it's a bad movie though, it's just one of those movies that we all saw before. And there are much better and scarier versions of this particular story. The acting wasn't bad, but the story was just one of those déjà-vu stories. The entity that was supposed to scare everybody to death wasn't even near to any other classic entities from other similar movies. A true disappointment to me.",Verónica
8,thesar-2,Bien. Au Revoir!,4,25 May 2020,"At least, the hilarious nun from The Devil Inside showed up for comic relief.I heard someone call this the scariest movie ever. Well, that's subjective because I've told some jokes that, no lie, are the funniest jokes anyone has ever heard. See how this works? Anyways, I doubt this would rank in the top 900 scariest movies I've seen, but hey, it wasn't too bad.I guess they're trying to fool us into thinking this ghost/demon/possession/ish movie is based on a true story. I always love that lie, but okay, if it makes it scaaaaarier for some people, so be it.In this OOOOOOOOO scary true story, we have three girls talk with a spirit - perhaps our heroine's deceased dad! - via a more generic Ouija board than the Hasbro deluxe board ""game."" And, oh-no, are you ready for this? There might be an evil spirit haunting her post Ouija and putting her two younger sisters and one of the cutest little toddlers in the whole world at risk.Seriously, he's like the kids from Jerry McGuire and Pet Semetery had a brother no one knew about. He was definitely a highlight of this feature.I digress. Admittedly, the movie kicks into fun-gear in the 2nd half when the best scene of the movie happens. No spoilers, but it has to do with the most important meal of the day.But it wasn't enough to save the whole movie and I've seen these fake ""true"" stories far too often. I just had hoped this would've brought more to the table.***Final thoughts: One of my favorite articles I've ever read on disproving Ouija boards went something like this: to easily disprove a Ouija board, have three ""players"" present. 1 to watch and the other 2 controlling the planchette, only both of them have to be blindfolded. THEN, you still SEE how fake these are as the two can't spell out anything blindfolded or point to words. Easy peasy.",Verónica
9,851222,Boring and not good,5,10 June 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.As a huge fan of horror genre i really wanted to like ""Veronica"" (2017). Yet unfortunately this movie wasn't good, at all. Its kinda based on a true story, but there a lot of horror movies that are based on true story, aren't there?As a horror movie, it wasn't scary, nor its mood was chilly. At the end when creator throw every horror movie cliche at their viewers it got a bit creepy, but it was to little to late. Acting wasn't particularly memorable, nor directing or script. At its running time 1 h 40 min i found this movie way to long and simply boring. Not a good signs for a horror picture, or any picture at all.",Verónica
10,Platypuschow,Verónica: Even worse than I expected,2,16 March 2018,"Veronica is doing the media circuit at the moment being advertised as one of the scariest movies ever made, causing people to turn it off or walk out of the cinema in fear.Let me clarify it is a publicity stunt.I went in expecting something generic but I sure as hell did not expect something this awful.Spain has a long history of successful horror films, in fact I would consider Rec (2007) the scariest movie ever made. Top that with fantastic zombie cinema from the 60's-80's and they've proven that have what it takes.Sadly Veronica absolutely screams foreign influences, specifically Hollywood. Veronica is overwhelmingly similiar to your modern generic American films such as the Conjuring. It has all the usual tropes but somehow manages to feel offensively recycled and considerably worse.There is no originality to be found here, from the plot to the attempted scares it's all so terrible. So the bottom line, is it scary? Well no, in fact hell no. Very little actually happens and when it does the timing is off so badly all effect is lost. As much as I hate the likes of the Insidious and Conjuring movies they at least manage to get a jump scare or two in! This doesn't even manage that.Veronica is the absolute pits, I'd advise anyone even the most hardcore of horror fan to consider giving this a pass.The Good:Couple of well constructed scenesLead did a decent enough jobThe Bad:Predictible ""Twist"" Unashamedly boringNo originality whatsoeverThings I Learnt From This Movie:I'm left curious if the advert during the casting for the movie actually specified ""Must have enormous mouth""",Verónica
11,nairtejas,One-Line Review: Veronica (6 Stars),6,25 November 2018,"Paco Plaza's flowy horror feature Veronica makes a high impact as it starts unfolding after a ninth grader voluntarily invokes a spirit from the other world, with just the right amount of jumpscares and narrative horror, but ends up as a complex recipe that will make you shrug as you finish watching it, with only the 'based on true events' factor staying with you. TN.",Verónica
12,paulclaassen,Intense with very good acting.,7,27 November 2018,"Since seeing the excellent and disturbing 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' I compare all possession films to 'Emily Rose'. There have been some very good possession films since and there's been some really terrible films. 'Veronica' is one of the better films, thanks to Sandra Escacena's good and natural acting as 'Veronica'.When three girls play with a Ouija board during an eclipse - believed to be the time when darkness triumphs over light - Veronica cuts her finger on a glass when it shatters, and her blood is therefore considered an offering, or sacrifice. Things start going wrong from there, trivial at first but more intense as the film progresses. The film features some good scares, and very good visuals.",Verónica
13,eddie_baggins,An above average horror experience that's victim of severe over-hyping,7,25 March 2018,"Kudos to the marketing team responsible for Netflix's newest horror outing Veronica for making Rec director's Paco Plaza's film ""the scariest film of the year!!!!!"", a film that is supposedly ""so scary only 1 in 100 people can sit through it"" (if you believe the internet).For a small budgeted and subtitled Spanish horror, that would usually be bypassed by the masses, looking instead for their next Conjuring or Insidious, Veronica (a film which takes inspiration from a real life incident that occurred in the early 1990's) has become quite the wonder over a short period of time.While it's impossible for the film to live up the monikers that have been placed upon it by a world that loves to join carriages to the hype train, Plaza's film is still a highly effective and technically proficient outing that will cause one to double take when they eventually roll into bed after a viewing.Telling the story of teenage girl Veronica (played impressively by Sandra Escacena) who begins to wish that she didn't use a Ouija Board to try and make contact with her dead dad, Plaza's film creates an almost instantaneously ominous mood as Veronica's life begins to spiral out of control with an increasingly prevalent presence making itself a part of the teenagers life as she struggles to deal with looking after her siblings in the absence of her workaholic and depressed mother.There's nothing highly original about Veronica's set-up or scares but Plaza, who showed great promise with Rec and its sequels, delivers them in often unexpected ways and the films brilliant score by Chucky Namanera and the technical aspects of Plaza's direction and DOP work by Pablo Rosso help create a mood and atmosphere that is lacking in most mainstream or even independent offerings.The most disappointing aspect of Veronica as a whole is that from its groundwork it does begin to peter out in its later stages as the initial mysteries of what exactly is happening are answered and for all the ""scariest film ever"" taglines that have been thrown around concerning the film, the last act does feel like a non-event.Final Say - Veronica offers up a solid and technically sound horror experience that's filled with its fair share of solid and jump out of your seat scares and while Plaza's film has without question been the victim of over-hype, Veronica is likely to remain one of 2018's most memorable horror experiences.3 ½ blind nuns out of 5",Verónica
14,Tweetienator,The Horror of Wearing Braces,4,22 April 2018,"I don't know what kind of faint hearted get scared by this movie - the most scary thing in the movie are the braces of Veronica ;) Overall I miss really a suspenseful and scary ""feel"" in this one. Never I felt something like horror, just watching the director and writer doing the necessary steps of checking off the list for ""making a horror movie with a demonic presence"", or something like that.Well, the acting is okay (Sandra Escacena as Veronica does well), the production value is okay, and what you get is your pretty standard Oujia board story: connecting to the dead and getting some evil demon on the line and lalala with some ""real event"" flavor. I don't know why this movie gets so much of appreciation - maybe local support from Spain!?All in all watchable, but don't expect the masterpiece of horror many people claim Veronica is - The Conjuring just plays in another league. After all the praise I was rather disappointed.",Verónica

16,jtindahouse,Nothing ground-breaking by any stretch,6,12 March 2018,"To be honest I would probably never have seen 'Verónica' were it not for countless articles I saw with headlines like 'People are unable to finish it' and 'The scariest film in years'. They peaked my interest and in my modern desperation to find good horror films I decided to give it a go. I probably needn't have bothered. It wasn't a bad film, but it certainly wasn't ground-breaking or original.Firstly, I can guarantee you there's no point where you'll feel obligated to turn it off (from a terror stand-point at least). The ending does ramp things up a bit, but it's definitely nothing that is going to bother any seasoned vets of the horror genre. The subtitles in the film aren't ideal, but they're easy enough to follow and don't distract too much from the visuals.There are a couple of dream sequences which are a pet hate of mine in horror movies, but the way they're done is partially forgiveable, because they relate to the story (and could even potentially be more than dreams). You'll need to see the film to understand what I mean by that. There are also very few jump-scares and the horror relies more on visuals than anything else which is a positive. I did very much like the way the film ended as well. It was clever and the most original part of the film. If you're not put off by foreign language and you're all out of fresh horror movies to check out then it's worth a look. Otherwise, look elsewhere for better.",Verónica

19,TdSmth5,Terrible,2,17 June 2018,"Cops are called to some scene in an apartment. They arrive and are stunned. Then we are taken a couple of days back. Veronica is a teenage girl raising her 3 little siblings since the mom works 24/7 at some restaurant. She goes to Catholic school and one day plays the Ouija board with some classmates. She thinks she's contacted her dead father. Of course afterward weird but entirely unscary stuff starts happening. There's a blind nun at school who knows what happened. Veronica forgot to the end the Ouija seance properly with the ""good bye"" so he brought something into this realm from another. Now she has to go back and finish things properly.This is supposedly based on real life where Spanish cops concluded there was some supernatural even going on--the only time they've done so. The movie ends with pictures presumably from police records which are a little creepy. But aside from that Veronica is complete junk. The hype is either completely fabricated or people are so fond of REC that they feel that this director can do no wrong. Oh but he did, ""Paco"" Plaza completely botched this thing. Is it that hard to make a good Ouija-based horror movie? The 80s movies are masterpieces compared to the garbage made in the last couple of years. Veronica us the worst of them, utterly unoriginal, dull, boring, slow with absolutely zero thrills.",Verónica

22,thekarmicnomad,Lots more build up than pay-off,7,16 August 2018,"A girl plays around contacting the spirit world and gets more than she bargins for.From the opening scene this looks like it is going to a found footage movie like Rec - it is not.It has a very European feel to it and does not mind taking its time.
The first half an hour of the film is all about characterization.
You really get to walk a mile in the shoes of a school girl shouldering the responsibility of raising her younger siblings.The camera, lighting and set design is absolutely amazing.
It is one of those films that makes you appreciate HD.As the film slowly winds up to some super natural action the time spent building a connection with the characters really pays off.
I was really concerned about the characters and what the impending evil would bring.The only problem with this film is it is massively front loaded.

Starting from Rec. trilogy and ending up with this unusual creepy ""original on its way"" Ouija board Horror.The plot as common and boring as it would sound ,, a Ouija board turns into evil supernatural force fight, yet Paco made it look more original especially adding these ""true story"" stuff at the beginning and the end which usually freaks me out, and then splashing it with mysterious jumpy moments,, i mean for a guy who don't scare easily, i flinched more than a couple of times in here.The cast was good in general, not interacted with most, but that actress Sandra Escacena ""Veronica"", man!! for a first time big screen actress she can really act and convince .The cinematography was fine for a regular horror movie,, yet to be precise and honest in some scenes ""when the hand of that evil spirit comes out or shocks someone"" it was creepy but not using the best out there,, to makes-up or whatever makes these things,, but it did not effect the superiority of the creepiness of the movie or the authenticity of these jumpy moments.Final thought,, been watching Spanish movies for a while now,, so when i say this movie is one of the Top 20 best movies in my list, and one of the few top best horror movies so you gotta take it seriously ;)",Verónica

27,Patient444,Delivered.,6,7 January 2018,"Veronica is indeed as another review stated, an one time watch, but it is worthy of that watch! It doesn't rely on scare jumps, gore, violence, it delivers on the typical Spanish movies level: tension! And a nicely plot with plenty of details.It was a straight possession horror, with good character development, nice dialogue tho it could have been improved and a better story that didn't come down to loud noises and strong contrast between light and dark. It focused on what it wanted to tell and managed to connect with the viewer. At least it did so with me. I enjoyed Veronica and so I shall recommend it! It does its job and it does it nicely.Cheers!",Verónica
28,kuarinofu,By the book,6,11 January 2020,"Veronica is what you call a horror film by the book.The whole story is constructed from various elements of other movies, Insidious, the Conjuring, Ouija, Annabelle and even Sinister. It was clearly inspired by the style of James Wan, but the pacing is completely messed up. It lacks all the subtlety, breaking the basic rules of horror films, that is, you don't show your evil spirit as long as you can. Once it's on screen, it eliminates the fear of the unknown.The puberty/growing up storyline is established, then forgotten, then brought up again, then forgotten once again.There ending is lackluster, no interesting twists whatsoever, they just sort of confirm that the story was indeed what you thought it was.Don't get me wrong, it's technically done very well, but as a horror fan I always look for originality and interesting ideas in these films.

The story is KINDA good but nothing else. The costume of the demon is very very cheap. It's evident that they couldn't do it properly. It looks very very cheap.

31,maccas-56367,High quality Spanish horror,7,11 January 2020,"I once owned a ouija board. It gave me the heebie jeebies so bad that I sold it to some woman called Ramona for $20. I always wondered what happened to Ramona.Veronica had a refreshing vibe about it from the start. The Spanish certainly know how to make good horror movies. They're seemingly reinvigorating the genre single-handedly. Veronica stands strongly alongside the likes of Rec and The Orphanage.Was it the scariest film since The Exorcist, as hype would suggest? No. But it felt different and was genuinely scary and creepy in its own ways. It didn't feel the need to resort to cheap jump scares and I appreciated that - my heart did too. The scares were still enough to make me seriously uncomfortable though.The fact this was all based on a true story just rammed home the scariness. When things became a little unhinged towards the end, the police angle of events added an element of authenticity and creepy ""realness"". It's probably that which makes it all so unsettling.Highly recommend to horror fans, and anyone into Spanish cinema.",Verónica
32,nitzanhavoc,"Nothing innovative, still an excellent film!",7,26 July 2018,"Let me start off by saying I have certain difficulties with foreign films, having been raised on Hollywood standards and conventional cinematics. I consider this to be a personal flaw and the result of early age conditioning, which honestly should have been broken by now following masterpieces such as Ju On (Japanese) and Martyrs (French). Unfortunately, this flaw often makes me delay watching foreign Horror even when it's conveniently and immediately available on Netflix. Thank heavens I eventually get to it, or I would have missed on Veronica, which is in my opinion simply an excellent and fun film.It is noteworthy to mention that virtually nothing about Veronica is innovative or original, save for certain aspects of the evil spirit's behavior and methods. From the painfully overdone story (teenagers using Ouija board, evil follows, haunting commences) to the portrayal of the haunting itself (poltergeist effects apparent in the house, mouth agape beyond what is physically possible for humans etc.) Veronica resembles any of the dozen plus ghost stories proceeding it in the past decade. And yet, something about the different atmosphere, the unique and almost idiosyncratic features of the spirit and the added value from witnessing the heartwarming relationship between the protagonist and her younger siblings simply makes Veronica a rewarding and fun viewing experience from start to finish. Acting is right on the spot even by young Iván Chavero making a very impressive debut, soundtrack and cinematography accompany the story and characters just as they should, and everything simply fits together perfectly.The ending is slightly disappointing (as is the case with many Horror films), with a failed and completely unnecessary attempt at a plot twist (the film would have fine without it). This combined with the aforementioned lack of innovation makes me somewhat surprised and confused as to how much I honestly enjoyed this film. Like I said, everything simply comes together perfectly regardless to most of the features which are usually required to make a good Horror film great. All I can say is that I wholeheartedly recommend Veronica to any Horror fan, even if some of you might find it to be mediocre and average at best. I certainly haven't.",Verónica

The lead actress does a very good job same as her little ones. Some people complained about the slow pace. Actually I liked it that way and would have loved that Veronica would continue this way. Slow burning, tension and more hidden than right into your face. However it became for my taste a bit too hollywooedesque once the evil was revealed. It's for sure not the most scary movie on earth but it has it moments when it focuses on the subtle layers and psychological aspects.

It is a scene that is masterfully crafted, chilling for the average viewer and thrilling for filmmaking buffs who enjoy watching great techniques of a director.In many ways ""Veronica"" is a standard possession/haunting movie; but the fast pacing, the very good acting, and amazing photography puts this movie a few levels above the average horror offerings.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Verónica

54,rustonreviews,A by-the-numbers horror flick that's hardly the terrifying masterpiece it's made out to be.,6,13 April 2018,"Paco Plaza, co-director of the high tension found footage infection flick REC (2017), returns to the horror genre with Veronica, one of Netflix's latest surprise releases. Hype can be a dangerous thing, and the hype for Veronica soon spread like wildfire when many (more sensitive) viewers dubbed it as one of the scariest ever made, with several going so far to say they had to turn it off half way through. Based on a true story and set in Madrid, 1991, high schooler Veronica (Escacena) experiments with a Ouija board with two of her friends during an eclipse of the sun. Hoping to reach out to her father, Veronica ends up in contact with something far more sinister that follows her home to bring further torment. This premise isn't breaking new ground by any means, and there are dozens upon dozens of films just like this (it wasn't so long ago since we received Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016)). What's baffling about Plaza's new movie is how much it has seemed to scare many viewers witless. Though technically competent and capable of a few creepy scenes here and there, Veronica is a very standard affair that doesn't bring about the same level of frights as other true story flicks like The Conjuring (2013) or The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005). Although acted very well and shot effectively, I wasn't gripped with the story and found many of it's scares to riff off similar movies. Paranormal true stories are incredibly fascinating to me, and after watching films based upon them, I tend to go online and read further into the real-life experiences that were no doubt tweaked for its adaptation, but that wasn't the case for this film. Perhaps I had let the hype get the better of me. Veronica is by no means a terrifying film, and it won't be remembered like Plaza's previous works (the first two REC film's I heavily recommend), but it's passable as another routine Ouija board flick. Which, in itself is a shame, because I was expecting much more.",Verónica

57,derekjager,"Don't believe the hype; well-directed and acted, but no scares",3,1 March 2018,"So I just watched VERONICA. All the way to the end. Didn't have to turn it off. It's subtitled, which I don't mind, if the story is exciting. Although it's well directed and acted, there's simply no compelling story here to be told, nothing we haven't seen before. For some reason--never explained--three girls decide to ditch going on the rooftop with the rest of the school to watch an eclipse, a big event--never explained what significance the eclipse has--to have a seance with an Ouija board. Yes, one girl actually brings a large, clunky Ouija board in her backpack to school. They girls go into a basement in the school, have their encounter. The usual happens. Candles blow out, the board breaks in two, the girls run away. After that, there are a lot of scenes of Veronica caring for her three siblings; her mother works a lot, her father is dead. Is Veronica having a breakdown over all the pressure or...is some evil spirit hanging around because the girls never said ""goodbye"" like you're supposed to when using an Ouija board? (Who makes up these rules by the way?) The last fifteen minutes stumble and collapse a bit since try though they might, Veronica and her siblings can't say goodbye to the spirit since another one was invited to the house! So, is it now two spirits? And is Veronica crazy, possessed by one of the spirits or two of them? By the time it was over, it really didn't matter. This was all addressed MUCH better in THE POSSESSION OF EMILY ROSE. VERONICA is supposedly based on the true story of Estefanía Gutiérrez Lázaro, but it plays very fast with the timeline, people involved and events that occurred. Regardless, this is NOT a scary movie--it's a well directed and acted one. It's like a Blumhouse light movie.",Verónica

""Veronica"" is a better than average supernatural thriller from Spain (subtitled) that keeps one on the edge of the seat the majority of the time.

I like the interpretation of the story and the little changes they made to make it more personal and to prevent some potential plot holes. This film sticks with you it is a psychological thriller more than it is your typical ""scary"" film. If you dont mind subtitles and are interested in horror films I'd recommend this film. Without spoiling I did want to add that I liked the little twist at the end and the subtle hints throughout the film that if caught you will see the twist coming but still enjoy that its there.

The movie actually morphs into a parody on itself because of two very ridiculous scenes in the middle of it. I get that it's a ""homage"" to old 60/70s movies, but it's executed in a way which harms the movie and the atmosphere it built.The score is nice (and of course it's retrowave), but it's just there and that's it, entirely forgettable.",Verónica

Some of the visuals were creative and imaginative but at other times some flourishes (such as a period of retro musical score) seemed to be tending to spoofery. There were many weaknesses, for example there was a hint at an explanatory backstory with the upturned mattresses which would have been a satisfactory conclusion; that wasn't developed at all.

It actually helped me pay more attention to the film and get more involved in it to have English subtitles, so being a Spanish film didn't bother me at all in keeping my interest.

When you read user reviews of this film or social media reviews you're led to believe that nothing has been more terrifying or psychologically disturbing as Veronica. However, this film doesn't meet up the high standards expected of it and the screenplay is bland and largely forgettable. There are some relatively strong acting performances in this film which have prevented me from giving it a lower rating and there are a boatload of worse, more generic modern horrors than Veronica however the film suffers horribly from pacing issues and the screenplay fails to ignite any feeling.

68,myignisrules,Viral Marketing & Veronica,6,15 March 2018,"Viral marketing goes back to the very earliest era of cinema and it was especially used for the horror genre. From Psycho and The Exorcist, to Jaws and The Last House on The Left, horror movies were lauded as being ""TOO SCARY TO WATCH"", ""NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART"", and one of my personal favs, ""YOU'LL NEVER SLEEP AGAIN!"". Netflix's VERONICA is the newest horror flick, to use viral marketing, and it most definitely worked. Not only did they report an uptick in views for the movie, but I can speak from personal experience, as friends reached out to me (their resident horror afficanado) to find out if I had watch the movie and if it was really as terrifying as everyone said it was. Answer: Depends......You see, fear is relative. By that I mean, one person may be terrified of spiders, while another thinks they make great pets (those people need Jesus, but that's a topic for another time). Because of this, a mainstream, or 'light' horror fan will probably get more than a fright, from the ample jump scares, the story of a possible possession of a young woman whose only real crime is she misses her father and the musical score which utilizes quick loud noises to scare the piss out of you. For more hardcore fans (c'est moi) Veronica is an okay film. It's well acted by it's young lead (Sandra Escacena) and the deeper themes of loneliness, family and the fears that come with growing up and having your own body change (something that can feel like a betrayal at times) make for an interesting watch on a Sunday afternoon. My only real issue with this film is it's opening. I don't like movies that begin, by revealing the ending first, as it takes away from the tension that builds, if you have an idea of what's to come. This is especially detrimental to a horror/thriller movie. So what are you? Do you dip your toe into horror, or do you dive head first into the deep end?Depending on your answer, watching Veronica will either be that horror movie you watched to pass the time, or a movie that scares the hell outta you!

Still, this movie caught me, deeply, ye did not actually scare me, but interested me, by how well developped it's story was for an horror flick! The way the movie tries to scare you while really explaining you, every details of what is really going on, was something that really gave me interest! That movie does have some really memorable scenes, mostly in the start some scenes were trully scary and trully showed us a new take on how brutal it is to get possesed. The actors too did a really great job, no one was either used too much in the movie or not used enough they all had their roles and the main star did a really deep performance! I'd say it's a really good film that shows us there is much more in the horror domain then only the USA, that foreign countries can easily make the job too, and even surpass the USA. Yet the movie itself was not an horror masterpiece of the 2010's, it wasn't no *The Witch*, or *It Follows*, the movie was no big suprise, it was scary and good.

Specially Veronica and antonio did awesome job with their role.,Verónica
75,lvanderwindt,GREAT,9,5 February 2020,"Just a really good movie, normally I don't really like different languages in movies. But with this one I feel like it made it better, because of the Spanish you're really looking and concentrating on what they are saying. The ending scene where she was like 'Woops guess I didn't leave the house with my brother in my hands.' and goes back in the house and all the pieces you might've not understood just fall into place and the picture becomes much clearer. Sandra Escacena is doing an amazing job literally at the time this movie was shot she was only 17! Great movie!!",Verónica

77,sleemice,Worst horror movie,1,9 April 2020,"I honestly don't know where to start. The plot of the movie is weak and has zero originality. What makes it even worse is that it was advertised as ''The best horror movie '' by Netflix. The main actors were dull, boring and had one note in voice, acting, emotion for the entire movie",Verónica
78,MikialUK,A complete waste of time,3,6 April 2018,"I was extremely disappointed with this so called 'horror '. I'm a fan of the genre and this is utter insult to audiences who are expecting good from such high ratings. How on earth did this piece of junk get that particular score is beyond me. Must be fake. The story is boring, the acting too slow, the demon is atrocious and laughable I can make a better cgi with my phone. All in all avoid at all costs.",Verónica
79,abbiejarrett,Same old same old,5,6 October 2018,I chose to rate this smack bang in the middle as it was not bad but nor did it thrill or scare me like I expected it to this film has been so hyped up that I expected it to be super intense but actually it's exactly the same as every other movie of its kind once you've seen one supernatural ouiji board movie you've seen them all it would seem,Verónica
80,skyhawk747,Typical boring movie that tries to be scary and fails.,4,3 March 2018,I do not understand what the hype is over this film?

86,theandreaceregini,Not the best movie by Paco Plaza,6,11 September 2019,"This movie starts in a way that makes you think ""holy ****, this is going to be PacoPlaza-awesome!"" and then proceeds to betray your hopes and dreams, slowly turning into the average hollywood demonic possession movie where nothings make sense anymore and everything just... happens. I love the setup and the interaction among Veronica, her siblings, her friends and the blind nun that happen during the first half, but I honestly coudn't care less about the ""young girl entering puberty"" metaphor that permeates the second half. Also, the closure felt a little bit forced: ""based on a true story, can you believe it?! Are you scared now?"". Well, not really really. 6-",Verónica
87,pacvik,Not bad.,8,11 October 2020,"Good movie based on fiction. Great about such movies is that there exist a story to be told versus one that must be conjured. Makes things simpler. There is a cohesive & coherent story here. If interested in blood & guts to humor you, go elsewhere. Although if interested in paranormal activity, then give it a view. You won't be disappointed.",Verónica
88,marc-cheyne,Don't waste your time,3,10 January 2019,"This is like a bad 1980s movie. It deserves a rating of 3-4, not 6.2. There's little or no suspense or frights. If you want to watch a good Spanish horror movie, watch Aterrados, Satan's Slaves or The Devil's Backbone.",Verónica

90,thomasellery,Spanish Symbolism,7,2 September 2020,"Firstly the amount of reviews on here about this film that start, 'I saw on social media that this film is supposed to be....' - please let this nudge you in the direction of realising social media is mainly sponsored content or full of people who really aren't that good an influence, at least check reviews on here first to get some balance.Anyways back to the film, for us English folk who are usually limited to only speaking our own language, there's always a bit of commitment to a subtitled foreign movie, no flicking through your phone on the boring bits for this one, reading is required throughout. Luckily it plods along enough to keep you engaged and the simple script works in regards to being able to read and view easy, even if it's a bit weak for character building.There's nothing much new here from your usual teenage girl going through angst and puberty, whilst fighting off demonic possession and the horror level is set to the Conjuring / Insidious mark, so no major gore or surprises, so don't expect an outright fright fest, just an average horror story.However it does try and there's some nicely shot scenes, a few sprinkles of artsy symbolism and quirky camera work that keeps it visually interesting for those with a keen eye.The film fails in regards to it's lack of commitment to being artsy or commercial and isn't balanced evenly enough to fully pull off both.That said, it's well produced, the cgi and special effects are actually pretty good and not overdone, the story doesn't particularly drag and the acting is fairly ok.It's not a fantastic film, but it's watchable even with subtitles and there's certainly a lot worse out there.Anything I score a 6 or less on I regret watching, I don't regret watching this but I wouldn't revisit it fir another view. 7 it is.",Verónica
91,qais_kawar,Spanish Horrors are actually better than new American ones,8,4 March 2018,"This movie was actually not bad at all. I felt that it needed to be scarier, but thats okay....
Its a great movie .....
great plot.....
plus i love true stories, it makes the movie even more exciting.....
No i don't think its the best horror movie of all time....
but yes i think its the best i have seen since the conjuring 2
AND ITS SPANISH !!!! thank u Netflix",Verónica
92,zeuthuk,Boring,5,17 October 2018,"After 40 minutes I switched off. B level horror with low production value that doesn't scare. The frightening parts were cheap and unconvincing. The rest of the film is watching a bunch of girls walk around in school uniform pulling faces. Hollywood seems to be allocating more budget and effort towards TV shows and film quality has really dipped. With that in mind is Veronica better than watching my favourite TV shows, absolutely not hence I switched off.",Verónica
93,recklesscow,The production values make it.,8,18 April 2018,"I'll say it right now: supernatural films don't scare me. Being a non-religious person, the subject matter always seems irredeemably hokey to me, and certainly the idea of a film about the aftereffects of a seance seemed like a recipe for a whole lot of eye-rolling cliches.Well, the film does have the characteristic cliches that plague nearly every film of this nature, but the film's production values are otherwise so top-notch and the execution so on-point that these can all be forgiven.Taking place in Spain in the 1990s, the film uses its locations to full effect (the apartment the title character lives in would be creepy enough on its own, and don't even get me started on that creepy school basement), the music and sound design are top-notch, the acting is convincing, and the scares, albeit cliche, are directed and edited so well that one can forgive any shortcomings in the script department.The film oozes with atmosphere throughout, aided in no small part by an amazingly simple yet effective score that really heightens the tension. Plot-defining moments such as the seance in the school basement (which begins the trouble) are made all the more eerie by the music, which, combined with the stellar direction, really sets the mood for what's to come.But the film works beyond the horror level as well, painting a convincing and utterly sad portrait of a family still coping with the loss of one parent and the ensuing challenges this loss forces on our main character, whose motherly surrogacy isolates her from her friends and makes her all too relatable to those of us who led turbulent teenage years.By the time the eerie ending came, I barely felt like an hour and forty-five minutes had gone by--I was having too much fun.",Verónica
94,callvikastimes,Veronica please leave!,3,7 December 2018,It's one of the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Nothing demonic nothing to scare the audience. Yes three dumb kids will bore you. Demon was looking like he bathed in chocolate. I mean please stop Netflix showing these craps.,Verónica
95,marcooleo,Must see!,10,7 December 2018,I have seen many great horror movies. This one belongs to my top-10 list. Afterwards i got afraid of the dark and needed to lit up the lamps and clear my head from it with watching the news on TV.,Verónica
96,imdb-14850,Clever and surprisingly refreshing,8,27 June 2020,This is definitely not a rehashed story we've seen umpteen times. It brings something refreshingly different to the party and ticks many necessary boxes. I'd love to see what James Wan would do with it because this film is of his ilk and calibre. Only downside surrounds the soundtrack. The composee had been watching too many synth-based 80s films. But enter with an open mind.,Verónica
97,kvang145,The Importance of Suspense.,5,10 December 2020,"If you're looking for a possession movie, this is one. If you're looking for a suspense movie, this is not. The movie has some good surprises, but not suspense. In comparison, you would call that mystery, which fits perfectly with its point of theme. While the movie is ""fine"" to watch, I really had a hard time getting any thrills. While there were some character developments, it's really just a sad story that no one can care about...This isn't a really great movie to recommend others, but if you're all out of option, this isn't one to hate either. It's VERY NEUTRAL (hence the 5/10 ;P ) Most importantly to say, this is a PG13 ""mystery"" film, with only 2 scenes of brief violent/gore that pushes it to the R maturity.Here are some positives you can find in the movie, if you're still curious into watching it. The movie doesn't contain annoyingly loud surprise music. There are no dead silence... (so you won't get scare?). Story falls with ""based on true events"" kind of movies. The heroine takes action... no dumb character cliche. Evenly paced. Finally, enjoyable actors, even from the kids.",Verónica
98,mikebudge,"Dubbed into 5 languages, none of them English",1,3 March 2018,"This film borders on unwatchable but not because of the hype around it being particularly scary. What is scary is the arrogance of the production team that think it's a good idea to release it in five different languages, none of which are English.Watching subtitled foreign language films is one thing but for one where they have clearly chosen not to bother to provide an English track it's just not worth the effort. Its supposed to be a 'horror' film, filled with suspense...constantly having to shift your focus to read the subtitles is too much of a distraction, it gets tiring, your attention shifts and you end up just not bothering to watch it.Was it scary? It has its moments.
Will you enjoy it? Depends if you have the patience to put up with it as it's very slow.",Verónica
99,dhti,Not bad,6,21 July 2018,"The style and atmosphere give this move some originality. Also the setting, age and situation of the main character make this movie refreshing. The story itself is really similar to other horror movies.

Seems most characters in horror movies agree with her.",Verónica

Absolutely not. And if you did turn off your TV, you are a sissy, and shameful to society. I've watched commercials scarier than this movie.",Verónica

This genre has been done many times and often not well, but this movie nailed it in my opinion. The atmosphere remained tense and creepy through the film. The acting was also good. I relied on the subtitles, but still really felt for the characters and was drawn in by their reactions. I was really rooting for the characters through the entire movie. The movie was not overly reliant on jump scares and the ones present work well. There's a feeling of dread maintained from pretty much beginning to end. This one is worth checking out!",Verónica

Sure, it's not the most original horror I've ever seen - it owes a lot to many, many others horrors and thrillers - but, thanks to strong performances and good, if not altogether original, little directorial and editing techniques, and an effective score, I didn't feel bored with it at all. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but, I have to say, I don't see a lot for the film's detractors to focus on. I think 'Verònica' is a fairly good movie.",Verónica
105,foxtrotonefw,The ratings tell the story,7,4 August 2021,"Look at the average ratings and you'll generally get a good idea that for an overwhelming number of people, this was in the 'okay' to 'pretty good' range. As always we have the haters who decide to give movies a 1 without considering any of the specific content, and people who give out 10s like candy at a parade. The truth as with 99.99% of films lies in between.Like others I found this entertaining, and like others there were some slow parts. For those who cry about cliches (there are some), I'd like to look at your ratings of older movies and see if you really appreciated them for 'creating' the cliche, and then challenge you to go create something better instead of blasting every film with one.Cliches exist because, well, they work for most people most of the time. Should I follow the rolling glass? Why not play with a ouija? We see these things and yet we still keep watching movies when we know every film or show has them. You could stop watching and read instead but guess what? There are cliches in literature.People do stupid stuff all the time and yes, sometimes the unthinkable happens. If they didn't the average lifespan would be 100. So get over it. You could choose to find these humorous and think of the film as horror-comedy-science fiction, would that work?Now off my hyper-critical soap box.I didn't love Verónica but I've seen much much worse. The acting wasn't horrible in general. It wasn't riveting but it was entertaining enough, if you want to be entertained. The special effects, imperfect, but not every film is high budget. (look at it as comedy then). The story is based on an allegedly true story, so how do you criticize that? The artistic licenses with the facts of the story were okay or logical in areas, worse in others. And if you don't want to consider the actual story original enough, then surely it's better than a 1 in the originality category compared to the 'let's move into this abandoned house' or 'there's a psychopath chasing us with a ___' (choose gruesome weapon).If you like to slam every other movie and often rate things as a 1, the don't watch it! What's it say about you if you saw a 6.2 rating and 'wasted your time'? You followed that rolling glass, didn't you.",Verónica
106,axekicker78,"Good God, Tellulah is scarier than this movie.",2,11 September 2018,"IMO, Netflix is likely behind the ridiculously overstated hype for this film, sponsoring third party videos on SM like, ""Movies too scary to finish on Netflix,"" that I and others fell for. I guess it never occurred to them that people didn't finish it because it, uh, kinda sucked - not unlike 7 out of 10 of their features these days. Which is why they removed user reviews while purchasing cheap foreign content like this turkey. The soundtrack was particularly horrifying but in the way it was intended. What ever happened to foreign films being original. This turd was a derivation of a cliche based on a ripoff of a direct-to-video B movie. Cinematography was ok. That's about it.",Verónica

Well without giving spoilers; if you have seen films like the conjuring films or insidious and those did not scare you, then this will be a cake walk. The jump scares are extremely rare (which I enjoy because I feel that films Rely to heavily on them now days.) but are for the most part predictable. Now what got me was the acting. The acting in this film especially amongst the child actors is fantastic. And the concept is pretty decent. But it is definitely not as scary as the hype.",Verónica

However, this movie shines in its own way, aspects like the sound design, editing, and atmosphere are excecuted pretty well, the plot while not that great, does its job decently, and most interesting, the child acting is one of the best aspects that make it worth the watch, the kids' dialogue feels genuine and made me both laugh and feel bad for them more than once throughout the film.",Verónica

It's a decent movie but hugely full of cliches, even for this genre. Dead-eyed nuns haven't been scary since the '80s at best; it's like somebody was selling that gimmick recently and a bunch of filmmakers feel they need to get their money's worth out of it, but they should cut their losses. The only real surprise at all was seeing the spirit the girls got out of their Ouija board, because that was a disturbing revelation, but most of what played out was standard possession/haunting stuff.

I didn't feel creeped out in the slightest and I do love my horror flicks...The few jump scare attempts were feeble and didn't bother me. I'm no hardcore horror fan, unable to be scared by things that other people find scary...I freaked out quite a few times when watching The Conjuring and was definitely creeped out when watching the original Ringu but I'm going to be honest and say this just isn't a scary movie...great campfire story for sure but that's all.I gave this a 5 simply because it was an average movie and I really don't like it when movies are overhyped. It feels like someone was paying a lot of money to have review sites (rotten tomatoes for example) give this a massively overinflated rating. That will work to bring in viewers...viewers is money after all, but in the long run the real people that will review this movie will feel cheated and will give this movie a lesser score than they might otherwise have done.

I wouldn't say that it was a waste of time, I did enjoy the movie in general but there was nothing new or revolutionary about this movie and it is certainly NOT the ""scariest movie of all time"" - there probably were a lot of marketing geniuses at Netflix involved to create the hype.A lot of the elements reminded me of the numerous Ouija movies that already exist while other elements were ""inspired"" by other horror movies like The Conjuring.Conclusion: The real story behind the movie is certainly more interesting then the movie itself but if you are bored and are a Netflix subscriber give the movie a shot, but don't expect to get scared much if you're watching a lot of horror movies.",Verónica

132,edwardjones-23192,"In Veronica, Paco Plaza has another excellent contemporary horror movie under his belt: a reminder that great movies come from outside of Hollywood, too.",9,1 December 2017,"Paco Plaza took the horror genre by storm with the Rec. series (remade in English as Quarantine) and he's back to do it all over again with Veronica.The plot is fairly generic for horror, and is based on a true story, which means nothing to anyone except the marketing team. But Veronica's success lies not in its originality but in its masterful execution. Foreign movies often miss out on the blockbuster budgets that their American counterparts are privileged with. But the producers have spared no expense with Veronica.It's rare that movies are named after their protagonists. It would be easy to draw comparisons with Stephen King's Carrie, but there is a clear reason. Veronica is not a lens through which the story is viewed. She is the movie: her past, her fears, and her insecurities. The narrative delves deep into her character, not separately from the horror but within it. Another easy comparison to draw is with The Babadook. Veronica is not as focused, but it explores death in a more introspective way than most. Combined with more focalised cinematography, the central characterisation is second-to- none.Characterisation aside, Veronica is still a horror movie, and it rarely strays from its genre conventions, which is fine. Originality isn't always good. There are excellent movies such as this, which excellently execute the tried and tested genre conventions. It's a clear trend, though so many ignore it, that deep, resonant narrative make more successful movies. This year's IT (see our review here) is a perfect example of this, breaking box office records.Veronica nails the narrative expectations of modern horror.At its core, Veronica is a story about a teenage girl who has lost her father. And with her mother working overtime, she struggles with the weight of the family on her own shoulders. The manifestations of horror within the movie emanate from this same source, which is what IT does. And which works incredibly well. Characterisation and terror inform each other. We relate to Veronica all the more for the horror she experiences. And conversely, the horror becomes more terrifying itself because we care about Veronica and understand her.Veronica is the most cinematic horror movie to come from outside Hollywood.The horror is in your face. Vivid and loud. Not only is the sound design incredible, but the music boasts an original mix of conventional eerie scoring and synthesised 80s soundtracks. The acting and writing are flawless. It's a thrilling, euphoric, and cathartic ride. The only thing I didn't care for was the whole 'true story' element. In particular, the movie already had a great ending, which was succeeded by another scene, which served only to emphasise the 'true story' aspect of the movie.Review from Student Pages: https://www.studentpages.biz/veronica-review/",Verónica

Ugh. Don't fall for the hype. This is a very AVERAGE scary movie.

134,SwampWitxh,"Slow burn, but interesting",7,18 October 2021,"While this film isn't the ""edge of your seat"" type of horror movie, it still had some genuinely creepy and disquieting moments. It certainly could have been scarier and it is a slow burn, so it's not necessarily for the hardcore horror fan. If you tend to scare easy, though, this would be a good recommendation.Now for the positive: visually, the film is excellent. The use of location, camera angles, lighting, and shadows, all help create a beautiful film. The music choices are very good (I now have some new bands to check out), too. The young actress who plays Verónica has a natural talent, and creates a believably terrified teenager, and a sympathetic big sister. The other child actors are fun to watch; they're by turns adorable, funny, sassy, and also believably frightened. The cast creates a strong family bond that's moving and really draws you in. So even though it's not terrifying, you care about what happens to them. The family dynamic is worth watching the movie for.",Verónica

Just imagine the other side... how a ghost or demon shoves bags off a wardrobe or plays around with Simon... probably giggling in the process. Silly as hell and only scary when this is your first horror movie ever!At least there were some decent but not great performances. Don't believe the hype people!

1. it must convince me that i do not know what is going to happen next.
2. it must convince me that there are rules to everything that is happening. the world that it takes place in must make sense.this one fails at both. basically, it's just a few scary things happening one after another, but there is no depth to it. they just happen. imagine an action movie where villains appear out of nowhere at random, die without us knowing who they were and then they get replaced by the next one.

140,homerchrist,Good movie but overhyped.,7,28 May 2018,"First of all this is a Spanish language movie, so unless you're bi-lingual you might miss some of the dialogue. I read an article where there were a lot of people saying they had to stop half way through because it was too scary, so naturally, I had to watch it. Boy, were they wrong.
 It's also a netflix movie and since I cut ties with them and joined the Hulu bandwagon, I had to find it on my own. Easy to do.
 It starts out pretty quickly and builds from there. There wasn't much in the way of jump scares or slasher type horror, it is more cerebral. It's what isn't shown that get's the story flowing. I don't like leaving spoilers so I won't here. 
 I will say that the children actors, the sisters and brother were all really good. The friend Rosa was not near as good an actor as the family members. They did a great job making the story that much more believable. You can actually see the fear they have and you get drawn into believing that they are terrified. 
 It's supposed to be based on actual events, taken from the responding detectives notes on the case. There is a lot of conjecture to be sure, but all in all it was an enjoyable movie. It had a few moments that give you the chills but no real jump out your chairs issues. 
 If you are looking for a kill 'em all type of movie, keep looking. If you want something to sit back and watch that will give you the creeps, this is probably going to do it for you. 
 I can't stress how much the kids acting made this movie work. They have some bright futures in acting.",Verónica
141,ashzombola,Don't have a faceless entity... that has a face... that has no face!,6,7 October 2019,"SPOILERS.
Verónica starts ofF as a simple oldscool horror movie, which I like. It then goes no-where.
As we're patiently anticipating things to start kicking off, the 'paranormal' happenings go from minimal (which is cool) to full on (which is not cool) in the space of about 10 minutes.
The acting from the lead and the other kids is fantastic, but the whole point of watching a horror film I think, is to be scared. There's not a single moment in this film that feels scary. There's no tension, no build up, no suspense, shock, un-ease, no horror and most importantly - no antagonist! When you're dealing with a supernatural film you want supernatural elements, not a guy walking around in a suit. The terror that comes from a supernatural film is that you can't see it! You don't know where it's coming from, when it's going to strike, who it is, or what it wants. That's what's scary. You have absolutely no idea what to be scared of! But Verónica decides to show this faceless entity very early on in the film in the form of a black figure. So evil now has a face. Ok... rubbish, but whatever, let's see what this is all about then. oh wait... it doesn't. If you're going to show the evil manifested as a tangible being so early, then the remainder of the film should be about filling in the blanks of who and what this being is. Where it comes from, what it wants. It doesn't. It's just more of the same. 'Man in black suit walks around apartment'. There's no mystery, there's no story progression, just a 'man in a black suit'. And don't get me wrong some films use the 'you never find out' card extremely well if that's what it's intended to do, leaving you with a hopeless feeling of powerlessness. This doesn't. I wasn't even sad that she died, even though she did an absolutely wonderful job of getting you to care for her, because we don't even know why she died. 'man in a black suit just decided it'.
It 'could have been' really really good. But it wasn't.",Verónica

I love headlines that say things like this New Netflix Horror Film Is So Terrifying People Are Having To Turn It Off, they do exactly what they want you to do, watch this movie to see how ""Terrifying"" it really is. VERÓNICA is being compared to The Conjuring, which is one of my top 10 Horror Movies, I can see how they are comparing it, it's very similar, in fact almost too similar. Rotten Tomatoes of 100%, which at the time of me writing this was based on 12 reviews, Average Rating: 7.5/10. The Audience Score is only 73%, Average Rating 3.9/5 from 134 User Ratings.
Movies starting with the ending always make me wonder if they are worth watching, but I continued through this, primarily because of the hype. This movie is allegedly based on an actual police report in 1992; if I cared enough I'd probably dig to see that report. Being in European Spanish was fine, I understand enough, and the subtitles were there helping along the way when I didn't.
I think my favorite thing about the movie was the low-tech effects and the minimal CGI, it's reminiscent of movies like the original Poltergeist movies, and Halloween. The children actors were fun, and I wondered how much of their interactions were scripted, which made them feel more real. Sandra Escacena didn't overplay her role as I've seen in so many recent horror movies of this type; I didn't feel the need to gag at any point because of the overabundance of cheese. 
A few scenes made me shake my head just because I didn't understand the point of them. And some it felt too familiar to other possession movies. All in all, I enjoyed VERÓNICA. But was it so scary at any point that I needed to turn it off? No. I do recommend it, and gave it 4 Stars.

They lost all their scare factors when they gave us a face that didn't generate the amount of suspense our own imaginations could've gotten away with. The music sounds like I'm in a kid's movie. The protag acts like she's walking through a runway show instead of being generally unnerved, the other kids looked like they were playing and bored through most of the scenes that they didn't seem like they were trying to be scared or being strange, the ending was pretty obvious, and what the bloody hell is even the purpose of having the protag being generally creepy about her friendship with the girl next door if they weren't even going to DO ANYTHING about it?

164,WesselKoster,Disappointing and underwhelming,4,7 June 2018,"Veronica was directed by Paco Plaza and stars Sandra Escacena, Bruna González, Claudia Placer, Iván Chavero and Ana Torrent.I want to start off with saying that I am a huge fan of horror. I have a deep love for the genre, but unfortunately it's rare to see a really great horror film. That's why I am even sadder to report that I didn't enjoy this movie much at all, especially after hearing all the buzz about it.So let's start with the pros first. Sandra Escacena is absolutely fabulous as Veronica and delivers a very grounded and nuanced performance as does Ana Torrent. There is also a nun character played by Consuelo Trujillo who I also thought was very good. The movie is very good looking but unfortunately the story doesn't deliver, which leads me into my negatives.The structure of the story sucks any suspense that could be created out of the film. The opening of the film literally spells out how the film is going to end. Some of the other kids performances are very off and on for me as well. In one scene they are able to deliver the right amount of dread and fear while in some other scenes they can be very stale.Now I am a score guy, I really love film scores so much so that I listen to nothing else. And while the music here is pretty good, the film chooses to place very bombastic music under scenes that would otherwise be very suspenseful thus sucking any suspense that was there out of it.But my biggest flaw with this film is that towards the end the character of Veronica makes such a stupid decision that I immediately lost any sympathy that I had for her because she places the people she swore to protect in danger.So to sum it up: It's a pretty movie, it's an overall well-acted film. But it's the story that really turned me off. The film is available on Netflix it you want to give it a shot but I would not recommend it.",Verónica

167,Phimosa,A Pretty Standard Demon Film,5,27 February 2018,Veronica is a Spanish demon possession movie that does a lot right but has some major problems. Sandra Escacena does a good job portraying the titular character and the child performances were decent as well. The film is well shot and is mostly entertaining throughout. A couple scenes are genuinely creepy and there are barely any obnoxious jump scares. One of the main problems with the movie is that it is littered with annoying cliches. While the scenes mentioned previously were creepy most of the movie is just the demon trolling veronica by throwing book bags of shelves and turning on the television. With a run time of 105 minutes it's a little too long as well. The film's twist is also pretty obvious and I feel like a lot of viewers will figure it out early.If you like demon possession movies this is still worth your time and has a few scares to keep you entertained.,Verónica

Character development can appear stagnant at times, and the traditional horror question is raised - ""Why?"". Sister Death, though bizarre, could have had a much more profound presence in the film - albeit her character does fine. If you're a fan of demonic movies then expect a shadowy, infernal 100 minutes that will leave you satisfied.

190,wichoagc,******AVOID******,1,19 March 2018,"This movie needs to be taught at film schools everywhere as it perfectly encompasses every single cliche you need to avoid in the process of making a horror movie. You will not believe your eyes and ears at all the terrible artistic choices that where approved. First of all, the ""based on a true story"" trope, as we've learned, immediately eliminates any suspension of disbelief we might be willing to give anything that involves awful CGI demonic hands clipping disjointedly out of a mattress. 2: the spooky blind nun character that warns the protagonist about the ""demonic presence"" that surrounds her, okay... 3: the actual demon (which is just a dark shadow awful CGI guy with spooky monster hands) is shown way too much throughout the entire film, throwing any mystery the movie could have had out of the window.4: the music. Oh god is the music a pile of steaming garbage. The director couldn't make up his mind if he wanted to push for a ""Stranger Things"" nostalgia horror aesthetic (a terrible cliche in itself, and a particularly wrong aesthetic approach for a haunted house/demonic possession flick), a baffling outdated 50's classic Hammer horror soundtrack that poses as homage but actually is just horribly misplaced at the two scenes that could've had a shot at being actually scary if not for the stringy werewolf movie music, and 90's spanish rock that isn't such a terrible choice considering the film's setting, except it's the same song played over and over.5: tv's that turn on and off by themselves and paintings falling from the walls. Typical haunted house stuff that you might find scary if this was the first horror film you've ever seen and are under 12 years of age. 666: a stylized scene where the protagonist is depicted as running over a newspaper article she is reading that must-be-seen-to-be-understood-as-possible.7: a runtime of 100 + minutes for a feature that surely shouldn't have been more than trailer-length, since literally every single sp00ky bad CGI scene is already in the trailer itself. 8: excessive character exposition about people we don't really care about. 9: Ouija boards and underresearched rituals involving candles and an eclipse.10: as a native spanish speaker let me tell you, the acting is not that great, the script is garbage, I can see how for someone who doesn't speak spanish this might seem like good acting, but you'd be fooled. The children are alright, but this brings me to...11: children are not scary, they will never be scary nor do they help provoke any sense of real danger if you don't actually care about any of the undeveloped one-dimensional adult characters in the first place. I could go on about the bad CGI special effects, the unnecessary party scene with the goth friends where nothing happens, the cartoony shadows on the walls, the predictable plot twist and the annoyingly bad acting throughout this depressingly misguided nuisance of a film, but I already wasted a perfectly good sunday evening watching and reviewing (god knows why I decided to do this for free) this excruciatingly boring mess. Please promise me you won't see this.",Verónica

Even the ""Lights Out"" was quite scary compare to this.It can't compare with any of the James Wan's ""Conjuring"" series for there are a lot more atmospheric suspense and scare, as well as certain depth and style. Also very much agree to one other reviewer point out, not in English is a big distraction. When you have to read script for every frame, you basically don't connect with the film atmospherically, so of course it won't be scary.

195,miguelmorones,Verónica will possess you in the good way.,10,5 April 2018,"How is Veronica different from other possession films? Veronica is different in a lot of good ways. First off the cast is incredible. In most possession movies there is hardly any concentration on the story and character development but there is an insane amount of jumpscares. In Veronica it is the complete opposite. I'm not saying Veronica is an original idea it's your typical film of someone that gets possessed but this one keeps the jumpscares to a minimum, tells the story without any plot holes and great character development. 
Veronica tells the story of 15 year old Veronica that takes care of her 3 younger siblings while her mother works long shifts. One day at school Veronica and two friends perform a seance. Everything starts to turn upside down when Veronica gets possessed in the process. Sandra Escacena does an amazing job as the leading role. You start to care for her more and more in each act or as I like to call them the 3 phases of veronica. Phase 1 is veronica slowly getting possessed. Phase 2 is veronica realizing that she is scaring away her friends and family even herself. Phase 3 is veronica protecting her family from herself under any circumstances. Sandra Escacena does an amazing job portraying all of those phases and it's even more impressive that this is one of her first films. I honestly see a bright career for her.
Another big factor about this film is the CGI and cinematography. This movie definitely has the best visuals in a horror movie I've ever seen. Not gonna spoil the movie but there is some CGI moments, not a lot but very few. It was the best CGI I've seen in a horror movie. The editing is top notch as well, everything was well put together. Again I don't want to spoil the movie but there is one scene that shows some ceiling lights morph into the eclipse and then that morphs into a small flashlight, the way all three of those things morphed into each other just blew me away. Overall Veronica was a fantastic film, Amazing cast, Amazing execution to a very popular genre, great pace and a beautiful treat to the eye. Definitely a recommendation and it is definitely up there with my all time favorite films.",Verónica
196,dodgerfan-09797,"Is Veronica really ""the scariest horror film""?",1,29 March 2018,"Veronica's story is well written however the cinematography as well as the acting of the lead role is the only horror of the movie. The paranormal activity that occurred in the film was indeed horrifying if you count viewing the deceased father's genitals as a drag me to hell sequence occurs in Veronica's bedroom. The film had potential, but instead displayed a pubescent girl's mental breakdown as she tries to kill her siblings to which she believes a supernatural entity is committing.",Verónica

199,info-50091,Very light horror,4,19 January 2019,"Billed as Netflix's scariest movie, it might be so for the streaming service, but in the horror universe it's just another piece of recycled material.I watched this movie only because I wanted to see the development of one specific character: Sister Death. While the performances are acceptable, Sister Death's heavily commercialized image left much to be desired. Undoubtedly, her eerie expression goes along with the surrounding atmosphere but the character in itself fails to make anything particularly memorable, and that was a huge disappointment. Also, while most jump scare scenes where predictable from minutes before, one in particular failed miserably to deliver any chills; ending on a comical note that killed whatever drama was happening at that time.If you're looking for gore, this is not your movie. If you're looking for psychological horror with a dose of light supernatural elements, this can appease your taste. However, if you're looking for something original, you can watch anything else.As a hardcore horror buff - 20 years in the making - I was struggling to keep awake one hour in the movie. I'm only giving it a few stars because I actually enjoyed the solar eclipse sequence - most probably the only thing that interested me.",Verónica

202,cajundel,"Average movie, even though has good things",7,15 September 2018,"I just saw the movie ""Veronica"" and I must say that this isn't the perfect horror movie. I'll start by its flaws.
1. The obvious dreams. This film was expert at making obvious nightmares which are almost painful to watch. Seriously! This scenes were written really lazily. For example, if they made Veronica wake up (in the dream) and then the nightmare would happen, it'd be slightly more believable.
2. The cliches. Usually, lack of originality (a.k.a cliches) are what most bother me. And dang this movie was full of cliches! ""The protagonist is possessed by the demon"" cliche, is one of those. ""The evil/wise/creepy nun"" cliche is really annoying. (They even made a movie about it, smh) Even though the script was a little lazy written, accompanied by annoying cliches, this movie has a lot of good traits in it!
1. It's really entertaining! I watched this flick with my father, and I've never had such fun watching a movie with a family member. It really was a good bonding experience!
2. The acting. I have to say that the girl who played Veronica was splendid in this film! The kid who played Antoñito was really good for his age (come on guys, he's like 4-6) and the girls where good also (for their age)
CONCLUSION: I don't think that this movie should be taken too seriously. Yes, it has noteworthy flaws in it, but have fun.
3 stars for entertainment, 4 stars for acting.

The movie opens and I am excited, sitting by my seat ready to jump out of it but never once in the entire movie I got even tiniest bit scared. A 5 year old could watch this movie without getting scared. The are no horror / demonic scenes but 1 or 2 and even they fail to get your heart pounding. I had such high expectations but they failed miserably. I get it that it was supposed to be based of real story and all but the story line needs to keep moving and needs to keep you engrossed in it.

205,pmcanavan,Yet another disappointing Netflix horror film,3,29 August 2019,People who have said this film is the scariest horror film ever need to seriously get their heads checked. The actors did a good enough job and some of the scenes - the opening one in particular - were shot very well in my opinion however the film falls victim to a very predictable plot including the classic 'it was me all along' ending (I know it was based on a true story but I mean did we really need the montage explaining this surprise 'twist'?) and very weak horror which didn't manage to unnerve or scare me once.

207,fashionaholic,Paco Plaza Scares Again,7,7 March 2018,"""Verónica"", directed by Paco Plaza (REC), is an eerie take on another ""based on a true story"" tale, although this one backs itself up by presenting both the case file and photos of the actual home. In Madrid, 1991, Verónica (Sandra Escacena), Rosa (Ángela Fabiàn), and Diana (Carla Campra) decide to play with a Ouijia board during a solar eclipse. Verónica's father has recently died, leaving her the main caretaker of her three younger siblings due to her mother's (Ana Torrent) working circumstances. She wants to use the Ouijia board as a means to contact her father, but ends up contacting something entirely otherworldly...While this plot has been done in countless movies, ""Verónica"" remains fresh due to its slow-building tension, interesting camera work, and believable leads. The story is based on a case file based on the 1991 death of a young girl who experienced strange symptoms after playing Ouijia. The movie does an excellent job of not using this as the main scare factor, though the case file and images shown at the end remain eerie after what we have just seen. ""Verónica"" is an enjoyable horror movie that doesn't overuse jump scares or music cues, instead relying entirely on its lead's unraveling sanity to drive the story forward.",Verónica

The acting was done very well by the young lady who plays Veronica and of course the young children. The special effects were pure shit in my opinion, too much CGI. Why doesn't anyone use make up anymore? It's way scarier and realistic! I did like the scene with the father where he was all nude. That actually frightened me and I was hoping that they would play further on that but then they used this black ugly figure and lost me.

Very tiresome, cliche and unoriginal, added nothing new, nothing interesting. Fails to recapture the 80s horror atmospeheric retro score, felt too loud and inappropriate. You do not have to blame it on desensitization either, the film lacked the dread, the story, and the atmosphere of what deems a movie scary.

I along with many other horror fans know the pain of unoriginal horrors with jump scares and flashy CGI, that's basically half of Netflix's horror movie lineup.Not only was I taken aback by the Sandra's performance as Veronica, but I enjoyed the whole cast. This was treading the line between low budget cult horror and big blockbuster movie. Some of the scenes were chilling and had a lasting effect during the movie and afterwards while I'm writing this review.Without spoiling anything, they were very creative with the story, and some elements that supposedly happened back in 1991 are terrifying. The photographic evidence from the actual police report makes you realize this might be a realistic recreation. If you're a horror fan, this is a great movie to watch. It's a fresh breath from the ""cookie cutter"" paranormal movies, while at the same time has some elements that can spook you.

Few paranormal activities, few / lame jump scares, some good reflection / shadow moments - but overall too few for a great horror movie. I'd skip it unless you're a die-hard ouji fan.What is good and praised by other reviews, is the well done story of a teenage girl. You experience the day to day live and problems of the protagonist. That's great to get the audience involved, but I felt the movie was 85% of that and that's too much for a horror movie, where the ""horror"" itself falls short.There were a lot of questionable things that didn't add much to the plot overall - what was the significance of the solar eclipse aside from the teacher's remarks early on? It supposedly aided the being to enter this world, but the movie never picked up on that aspect again later, rendering it a generic explanation of the events. And what's with that scene where time went backward as Veronica went forward and then that doppelganger appeared?

Total internet marketing scam trying to follow the Blair Witch Project marketing plan. I fell for it and it didn't take me very long to figure this out while watching movie.
